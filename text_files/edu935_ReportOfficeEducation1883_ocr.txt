    REPORT. 
  
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERICI, BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1884, 
Sir: I have the honor to present my fourteenth annual report. 
It is impossible to reviéw the experience of the last fourteen years without being 
impressed with the increase in the amount of information collected by the Office, in 
the sources of information that have been brought under contribution, and the im- 
proved character of the information supplied. This improvement is noticeable in 
respect to accuracy, completeness, and arrangement, and it is a legitimate question 
how far it is attributable to the scheme adopted by me, with the codperation of ed- 
ucators, for collecting, classifying, sifting, and reproducing in systematic order the 
information sought. The form is indeed not perfect, and there has been hope of 
revising it, but the time and opportunity for the labor which this would require have 
not yet come. 
The past year has furnished abundant evidence of the gratifying growth of the 
Office in efficiency and usefulness in spite of the fact of its inadequate appropriations. 
Much additional labor has arisen from the increased number of school officers and 
teachers visiting here to consult the pedagogical library and museum. The number 
of volumes in the library has increased to 16,500 and the number of pamphlets to 
42,100. The library meet a want universally acknowledged among intelligent edu- 
cators, containing as it does sources of information nowhere else accessible in the 
United States. It has been a cause of personal gratification that I have been able to 
build up this library, so unique and valuable and so necessary to the progress of 
education, with the appropriation of only $1,000 a year for books; but at this point 
in this faithful economic service in behalf of the intelligence and virtue of the coun- 
try, upon which it is claimed by all statesmen that our institutions rest for their per- 
petuity, Lam met by the remarkable fact that $500 of this sum are cut of in the 
appropriations of Congress for the ensuing year. 
It should be observed, moreover, that no specific provision has ever been made by 
Congress for a librarian for this valuable collection. It has been necessary, there- 
fore, to draw upon the clerical force of the Office for the cataloguing and caring for 
the books. The card catalogue, so necessary in the work of answering inquiries for 
information, has been delayed by the necessity ef employing the assistants in other 
departments of office labor. I regret that it has been impossible to answer the many 
demands for the printing of this catalogue, 
Considerable additions have been made to the pedagogical museum, although 
only the small sum of $2,000 is appropriated for this purpose. The resources of the 
museum are entirely unequal to the demands made upon it. It is already clear that 
a carefully devised system of loans should be instituted. In answer to urgent re- 
quests a small exhibit of educational appliances and conditions was furnished gratis 
to the Louisville Exposition, Most emphatic evidence has been afforded that many 
school officers and teachers gained from this exhibit valuable ideas of improved 
methods of instruction. In all countries where education is progressive the exhibi- 
tion of appliances has been found a most effective means of promoting their adop- 
tion and improvement, Our schools generally suffer from the lack of these material 
aids, aud it is important that this Office should be supported in the endeavor to create 
v 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
  ¥E REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
among school authorities an intelligent appreciation of their use and value. The 
clerical force of the Office has been inadequate to the cataloguing of this collection. 
The work on the report of 1881 was completed during the first part of the fiscal year 
of 1683, and by a most strenuous effort the report of 1882~83 was substantially finished 
before the close of the same year. This concentration of the force of the Office upon the 
preparation of the report curtailed the efforts of the Office in other directions so much 
that the communications sent out show a falling off ofnearly 9,000. In thisand many 
other ways it is made most clear that it is utterly impossible to do the work required 
by law without an increase in the clerical force. The documents sent out numbered 
258,340. These covered a variety of important topics and to a considerable extent 
were placed in the hands of teachers and attendants upon normal institutes. 
Communications addressed to the Office, personal visits of teachers and school offi- 
cers, the Commissioner’s travels, and the requests for criticism and suggestion sent to 
every one receiving documents have promoted the closest sympathy between the Office 
and those actively engaged in advancing the intelligence of the people and dealing 
with questions of instruction, whether public or private. It is a fact worthy of note 
that there has been no considerable improvement in methods or progress of education 
in any quarter of the country during the year with respect to which the aid of the 
Office has not been invoked. 
The efforts of the Office to collect all available data bearing upon education, in 
which the teachers and school officers of the country have so widely codperated, are 
manifestly beginning to result in safer generalizations touching the various phases 
of instruction. Clearer views and more intelligent counsels are observable with re- 
spect to the most critical problems that have been under consideration. The forces 
that control education are better organized than formerly, the discussions in the 
meetings of teachers are characterized by greater breadth, the teachers in different 
parts of the country are brought into closer sympathy, and greater demonstrations of 
educational forces are rendered possible. 
The following publications have been issued since those named in the last report: 
Circulars : 
Circular No. 4, 1883. Recent school law decisions. 
Circular No. 1,1884. Meeting of the International Prison Congress at Rome. 
Circular No, 2,184, The teaching, practice, and literavure of shorthand. 
Circular No. 3,1884. Illiteracy in the United States in 1870 and 1880, with an ap- 
pendix on national aid to education. 
Circular No. 4, 1884. Proceedings of the Department of Superintendence of the 
National Educational Association at its meeting February 12-14, 1884. 
Bulletins : 
Planting trees in school grounds, 
The Bufalini prize. 
Education in Italy and Greece. 
Report of the director of the American School for Classical Studies at Athens. 
Miscellaneous : 
Answers to inquiries about the United States Bureau of Education. 
Preliminary circular respecting the exhibition of education at the World’s Indus- 
trial and Cotton Centennial Exposition. 
Description of articles sent to Southern Exposition at Louisville, Ky. 
The following, previously published, have been reissued : 
Circular No. 3, 1879. Value of common school education to common labor. 
Circular No. 2, 1882. Proceedings of the Department of Superintendence. ’(Twice.) 
Circular No. 4, 1882, Industrial art in schools. 
Circular No, 4,1883. Recent school law decisions, 
Schoo] discipline. 
Answers to inquiries about the United States Bureau of Education. (Twice.) 
Organization and management of public libraries. 
Instruction in morals and civil government. 
Natural science in secondary schools. 
These circulars of information are intended always for some particular class of 
workers in the field of education, the last persons in the world to be affected by 
abstract theories of their vocation or directions that have not stood the test of prac- 
tice. On the other hand, these persons are desirous of knowing what is done in

other schools similar to their own and by teachers and officers who have the best 
opportunities for development. Their desire is met by circulars which bring together 
in convenient form and classified order the best thought and the best practices that 
have been developed in the particular branch of the service considered. The corre- 
spondence of the Office abundantly proves that these publications have helped greatly 
to raise the standard of education throughot the country.

The only direct return made by the Office to this very large number of volun- 
tary contributors to its statistical information is the annual report and other publi- 
cations of the Office. It is impossible to estimate the amount of gratuitous labor’ 
bestowed in aid of the office work; for not only are the reports and statements from 
which this annual report is prepared made in the main without compensation, but 
there are constantly going out from the Office to the same contributors here and there 
over the country a large number of special inquiries. This free and full communica- 
tion of information is a constant stimulus to good effort in the Office. 
The endeavor to close the last report with the fiscal year was so heartily seconded by 
so many officers of education that I was encouraged to undertake to bring this report 
up to the end of the fiscal year also, that is, to June 30, 1884, and I hope for the 
future that it may be possible to end these reports with the fiscal instead of the calen- 
dar year. In certain particulars in which the last report could not be brought up to 
June 30, 1883, but ended with June, 1882, the figures for 1883 are inserted in this re- 
port with those for 1884, great care being taken to make clear in each case just what 
dates are intended.

  GENERAL CONDITION OF EDUCATION. XXIX 
It has seemed best that opportunity should be provided in this report for compari- 
son by States and Territories of the figures for each year successively. In order to 
do this, the figures for 1882~83 have been perfected up to June, 1883, while the 
figures for 1883-84 are compiled many months earlier than is usual. 
No report for 1882-83 was received from the States of Delaware, Florida, Iowa, 
Kentucky, the Territories of New Mexico and Wyoming, and the District of Colum- 
Dia.! In 1883~84, of these States, Delaware and Florida make reports, but for Iowa 
and the District of Columbia the statistics for 1881-82, for Kentucky those for 
188081, and for New Mexico and Wyoming those from the United States Census of 
1830 are still used. For New Jersey the figures for 1882-83 are also used in the table 
for 1883-84. 
The Territory of New Mexico has no superintendent of schools and can make no 
general report of its school statistics, and Wyoming makes no general report of its 
schools; therefore there can be no figures given for these Territories, beyond those 
furnished by separate counties or cities or institutions or those derived from the 
enforced decennial census. This is greatly to the disadvantage of these Territories. 
LEGAL SCHOOL AGE, 
In 1882-83 the school age remained the same in every State and Territory as re- 
ported for the previous year, except in Louisiana, in which State the age then reported 
as from 6 to 18 is for 1882~’83 given as 6 to 18, inclusive. 
This increases the total number of different school ages in the country from sixteen 
for 1881~’82 to seventeen for 1882~’83. 
In 1883-84 the school age in Texas was lengthened by two years, and is now 8 to 
16, instead of 8 to 14; in Dakota Territory the age was shortened by a change from 5 to 
21 to 7 to 20; and in Washington Territory it was shortened by two years, the change 
being from 4 to 21 to 6 to 21. Although Texas has still the shortest period in school 
age of any State or Territory, this period is now eight, instead of six years in 1882. 
SCHOOL POPULATION. 
In six States and three Territories, namely, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont, District of Columbia, New Mexico, and 
Wyoming, the figures for school population from the United States Census of 1880 
are still used, no State or territorial census having been reported by any of the 
States or Territories named of later date than the United States Census of 1880. 
DURATION OF SCHOOL. 
For 1882-83 three States and four Territories fail to report the average duration of 
the school period ; for 1883~84 four States and four Territories make no report. 
For 18&2~83 New Jersey shows the highest average, it being 192 days; in Georgia 
the average for the cities is greater and in Wisconsin the average term for the cities 
is the same as in the State of New Jersey, but in both States the average for the whole 
State would apparently fall below that given for New Jersey. For the same year 
Tennessee shows the shortest school term, 78 days. For 1863~84 no report of this 
item was received from New Jersey, and the States ranking next in length of term 
are Ohio and Rhode Island, both of which report 184 days as the average duration of 
the term. Of the Territories, Arizona stands at the head, reporting 210 days as the 
average length of the school term. 
TEACHERS. 
As in previous years, several States and Territories fail to report the sex of teachers. 
For 1882~83 this is true of Delaware, Georgia, and Maine of the States, and Idaho, 
Indian, and Washington of the Territories. For 1883~84 another State, Missouri, 
    
1Since the date of the above writing, statistics for 1882-’83 and for 1883-84 have been received from 
the District of Columbia. ‘These figures are used in the abstract of the official report of the District, 
which abstract is given among those of the Territories in the body of this report.

0.0.4 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
gives the total number of teachers, but fails to report sex. The total number of 
teachers in all the States and Territories has increased in two years (188% to 1884) 
from 293,294 to 307,804. 
SCHOOLS. 
Of the items reported in this summary, Part 1(A and B), namely, school population, 
enrolment, average daily attendance, and total number of teachers, all show increase 
in 1883 over 1882, and again in 1884 over 1883. 
FINANCES. 
The totals for each item of income and expenditure and public school property 
given in Part 2, Summary A, show increase in 1882~’s3 over the corresponding totals 
for 188182, and in turn those for 1883~84 exceed those for 1882-83. 
Public school income, expenditure, and school property.—The totals in these items for 
the three years are as follows: Income: 1882, $94,327,188; 1843, $97,967,739; 1884, 
$110,567,567; total increase for the two years, $16,240,379. Expenditure: 1882, 
$91,158,039 ; 1883, $97,844,521; 1884, $103,949,528; total increase for the two years, 
$12,791,489. Public school property: 1882, $216,562,197; 1883, $231,944,158; 1884, 
$240,635,416 ; total increase for the two years, $24,073,219, 
In all study of the subject of income it should be kept in mind that in some States 
the balance on hand from the previous year is included in the annual income; this 
fact has been carefully noted in the foregoing summaries, and a study of Table I of 
the appendix will, in most instances, show the amount so included. 
The apparent increase in public school property for two years from 1882 to 1884 is 
$24,073,219. If from this is subtracted $5,257,756, the value of property in Connecticut, 
which was not reported in 1882, the net increase for the two years is $18,815,463. 
Permanent funds.—The same number of States (35) and Territories (2) report their 
permanent school funds in 1882, 1883, and 1884, the States failing to report in each of 
the three years being Georgia, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. 
In each of the three years the total for the Territories is made up of a small fund in 
the District of Columbia and the funds of the Indian Territory. 
The increase in these funds in the States is larger than appears from the totals 
given, In Nebraska the estimate of the future value of the permanent school fund 
was given in 1882 as $23,000,000, while in 1884, a more careful estimate being made, 
this figure is given as $20,395,033, The apparent increase in the totals for the two 
years for the States should therefore have added to it $2,604,967, and the actual 
increase becomes $5,044,881. The States showing increase are Colorado, Connecticut, 
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New 
York, Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Those showing decrease 
are Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Nebraska,! and Virginia. For the other 
States the same figure is used in 1884 as in 1882, 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 
The record of public education in the United States for the period under consider- 
tion (183384) presents many interesting and important particulars. Efforts have 
been made in certain sections to direct public interest toward denominational schools 
and in others to limit the free schools to the most elementary work. Here and there 
such efforts have hindered the progress of free schools, but on the whole they have 
had the contrary effect. The growth of the free school system in the South, the in- 
terest manifested in the Eastern and Western States in various measures for the im- 
provement of the schools, the attention given to the subject by the public press and 
  
1 The figures from Nebraska show decrease, notwithstanding the fact that the State superintendent 
in a special letter to this Office writes of a large increase in the permanent fund. It is probable that 
the figure given for 1882 was too large an estimate. that for 1884 being spoken of as ‘a more careful 
estimate.”
-P-A-G-E-31
  SCHOOL INSPECTION. XXXI 
public societies, the enthusiasm displayed atthe meeting of the National Educational 
Association at Madison, Wis., show that on the whole the public school system is stronger 
than ever in the confidence of the people. Since the date of my last report, legisla- 
tion has been secured in several States increasing the efficiency of the schools. Ken- 
tucky has reclaimed school funds sufficient probably to add from $160,000 to $170,000 
to the amount annually distributed for public instruction, and has made provision 
for optional county school taxes to the amount of 25 cents on every $100 and $1 on 
every poll, in place of the optional district tax of $2 on every person sending a child 
or children to the district school. In Texas the office of State superintendent has been 
restored, and in both New Mexico and Kentucky provision has been made for county 
superintendents. In Massachusetts the law with respect to school supplies has been 
extended. Heretofore school books and other material have been furnished to pupils 
in the public schools of that State and the price taken out of the next annual tax. 
Now, school committees are required to purchase the necessary text books and loan 
them to pupils free of charge. . 
In several successive reports I have dwelt particularly upon the deficiencies of the 
rural schools and the obstacles in the way of theirimprovement. My judgment ofthe 
need there was for calling attention to this subject has been confirmed by the corre- 
spondence which has resulted from its presentation, which correspondence is especially 
gratifying on account of the evidence it affords that school officers and teachers in one 
part of the country desire to know what improvements have been effected, and by what 
means, in other parts. In a few States, at least in favored sections of these States, 
the rural schools are in a high degree of efficiency; but, considering the whole coun- 
try, their condition is still very unsatisfactory. The situation is clearly set forth 
in the abstracts of the appendix and in the summarized view of the individual 
States and Territories embodied in my own statement.. A few subjects that arise in 
this connection deserve more extended notice, 
SCHOOL INSPECTION. 
Inspection, which has come last in the order of development, I place first in this con- 
sideration, since I am persuaded that it would bea fundamental condition in asystem 
formed in accordance with conclusions derived from the most satisfactory experience: 
By inspection I mean the constant oversight of the work going on in theschools and of 
the condition of schoo] buildings, appliances, &c., with the definite purpose of cor- 
recting errors, removing hindrances, and insuring progress. This service requires 
officers qualified by scholarship, experience, and those natural dispositions that 
excite the respect of adults and the confidence of children. The officers should be 
well paid and should have authority to carry out the measures that they deem expe- 
dient. The school laws of certain of the States provide for such inspection, and it 
has been practically accomplished in a number of counties, townships, or groups of 
towns voluntarily united for the purpose ; as a rule, even where legal provision has 
been made for the service, it still remains to establish it upon asound basis as regards 
the salary, the qualification of the officers, and the time they devote to the duties of 
the office. 
The operations of this department in the different sections of the country and its 
deficiencies will best be understood by particular statements. 
Hon. Thomas B. Stockwell, commissioner of common schools, Rhode Island, observes 
in his report for 1883: 
The gross amount paid for supervision varies but very little from year to year, 
though the movement has been, if either way, towards a less expenditure rather 
than towards a greater. The fact is that, with the exception of a few places, the 
amount of supervision demanded and the compensation allowed have been so near 
nothing that the thing itself has come to have, at least, a very doubtful signifi- 
cance, while in some instances it has undoubtedly been worse than none. What 
is clearly needed is to proceed to the laying out of a system or scheme of super- 
vision that shall take the time, thought, and labor of qualified men and receive 
proper compensation. In other words, in order to save the money already expended 
for this purpose, it is absolutely necessary to put more with it. But the effect will
-P-A-G-E-32
  XXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
not be merely to save that comparatively insignificant sum. That is merely incidental. 
The result to be secured by such an increased outlay in that direction will be a greatly 
enhanced value of the whole school expenditure. 
The board of education of the same State advise that the annual appropriation 
from the State school fund be raised from $90,000 to $120,000, and add: 
We recommend that the payment year by year to any town of its share of the 
additional appropriation be made conditional upon the town’s adopting an efficient 
system of paid supervision, 
In California the average annual salary of county superintendents is $1,000 ; indi- 
vidual salaries run as low as $500, $300, even $80, In this connection the superin- 
tendent, Hon. William T. Welcker, says in his report for 1884: 
Another great defect in the system of the public schools is the fact that in many of 
the counties the superintendents of the schools are poorly paid; so poorly, indeed, 
that we can scarcely speak of their slender stipends as pay at all. The county super- 
intendent should be able to give and should be required to give the whole of his time 
to the duties of his office. * * * 
It will be objected that many counties are too poor to pay their school superintend- 
ent a salary which will engage his whole time in their service; that they are too 
sparsely settled, and that they must wait till more money shall have been invested within 
their borders. The ready answer is that to have good schools in the county is the best 
invitation to settlement and investment ; with population comes wealth, the enhance- 
ment of existing property, andthe production of more. Let it be well understood that 
any county, even the remotest and least developed, has superior schools, and the fact will 
give an immediate and great impulse toimmigration thither, Now, this great desider- 
atum may be had by simply paying one officer a decent salary. The people can impose a 
local tax on themselves for additional school facNities, and surely no school facilities 
can be so valuable as a good superintendent. But I prefer to invite the attention 
of the legislature to this important matter and leave the details of accomplishing 
this great reform to their wisdom. 
In Illinois, 26 superintendents spend all their time in supervision; 48, two-thirds 
of their time ; 69, one-third; and 105, one houra day. 
In Minnesota, 75 counties are provided with a superintendency of schools, leay- 
ing only one not so provided; but the conduct and effects of the service are widely 
different in different counties. Hon. D. L. Kiehle, the State superintendent, observes 
in his report for 1883~84: 
Unless the district will see to it that the highest intelligence and the interest of 
the people are represented in an efficient superintendent, who will introduce the best 
methods and the best facilities of instruction and provide for the more careful selec- 
tion and improvement of teachers, the loud voice of the multitude will prevail and 
experience will be lost in the chaos of ignorance and selfishness. These two years 
have only confirmed my judgment that our method of selecting superintendents of 
education by our political machinery is not the wisest, and is endangering educa- 
tional interests by introducing principles or precedents of selection which subordi- 
nate the interests of education to those personal or political. The advantages of a 
‘ood system of any kind appear in the general distribution of what would otherwise 
be confined to the few, because the better and more intelligent will do more for 
themselves by an unwise law, or by no law, than the ignorant and ill disposed can 
gain by the most wholesome one. Hence, some of our counties have for years elected 
capable superintendents, and their schools have been growing better, while in other 
counties the superintendency has been so inefficient that the evil is but slightly in- 
creased by the abandonment of the office. As it is, we must rely upon the diligent 
use of present methods to elevate public sentiment, and show, by example, how much 
is gained by good supervision. 
Hon. W. W. W. Jones, superintendent of public instruction, Nebraska, gives the 
following statement with respect to county superintendents in that State: 
The compensation of superintendents is slowly increasing, but the majority of these 
officers are as yet poorly paid. The average compensation of 58 of these officers in 
1881 was $507, and in 1882, of 54 eee $506. But, in 1882, 30 received less 
than the average, and 24, more. nly 2 received as much as $100 permonth. As 
a consequence of poor pay, much poor work is done; the best talent is not secured, 
and many superintendents have to combine other business with their school work 
in’ order to make a living. In the new counties this will remain a necessity for 
some time, but in older counties it ought not to be. A good superintendent can 
earn more by teaching than, in many instances, he receives from the county for 
superintending. I believe the work of the superintendent is necessary to the pros- 
perity of our school system, and he should be paid a sum proportionate to the work 
done. By the present law the compensation is placed in the hands of the county

commissioners, and the minimum sum per day is $3. Thirty-five are paid this mini- 
mum sum, a few receiving a little extra ‘per day for some classes of work. Eleven 
more receive $3.50, and only 2 even reach the maximum of $5. It seems to me that 
if these officers are worth retaining they should be fairly paid for the labor performed. 
I therefore recommend that a fixed salary, based upon the number of pupils in the 
county, be paid them, in place of the present uncertain amount. If this does not 
meet your approbation, I would suggest that the minimum per diem be placed at $4, 
instead of $3, as at present. As a suggestion, I would state that if the salary were 
placed at $1,200 in counties having 5,000 school population or more and at $1,000 in 
counties having 4,000 and less than 5,000, at $800 in counties having 3,000 and less 
than 4,000, and at $500 in counties having 2,000 and less than 3,000, and in counties 
having less than 2,000 a per diem of $4, the work would be somewhat better paid for 
than at present and no hard burden would be placed on the counties. By this 
arrangement and at the present enumeration, 8 counties would be in the first class, 
4 in the second class, 12 in the third class, 7 in the fourth class, and 33 in the last 
class. Justice to this hard worked officer demands better pay. Other States have 
tried a plan similar to this and find it works well.     
The superintendent of public instruction for New York presents the following state- 
ment of the system of school supervision in his State: 
In the rural districts the schools for the most part are ungraded and are supervised 
by trustees elected by the voters of the district and by school commissioners chosen 
by the people in the various school commissioner districts, The present plan of super- 
vision by school commissioners was inaugurated in 1856; it is not perfect as itis, but 
it is the best system that has yet existed and altogether better than any yet sug- 
gested. There are in the rural districts 112 school commissioners; for their services 
they receive $800 per annum and an additional yearly allowance by the boards of 
supervisors of $200 for expenses. The services of a competent man are worth more, 
The law clearly defines their duties, and there is work enough to keep them busy 
most of the time. Some of them, however, engage in other business. The law should 
be so amended as to require school commissioners to give their whole time and atten- 
tion to the duties of their office and the engaging in any: other business should work 
a forfeiture thereof. Qualifications for school commissioners have heen discussed ; 
although affecting their own interests, many.of them urge that only persons should 
be eligible to the office who have had successful experience in teaching and who hold 
either a State certificate, the diploma of one of the’ State normal schools or of a 
higher institution of learning. It seems reasonable that some qualification should be 
demanded, when it is remembered that teachers whom they are to examine and super- 
vise must be qualified and must have passed certain prescribed examinations before 
they are allowed to teach. Of course any qualifications required wouid not neces- 
ily give efficient commissioners. There are competent officers who have not the 
qualifications spoken of. Much depends on tact and natural ability for success; bat, 
if qualifications were required, totally unfit persons could not hold the office. The 
school commissioners generally have heartily codperated with the department, and, 
as a class, they have faithfully discharged their duties. The school commissioner dis- 
tricts vary largcly in size; the number of school districts therein ranges from 9, the 
lowest, to 196, the highest. It is evident that some school commissioners have more 
work than they can efficiently accomplish. I recommend that some action be taken 
to equalize the districts,       
     
In New Jersey there is great harmony of action among the county superintendents; 
they have succeeded, among other things, in securing uniformity in the text books 
used in 198 of the 361 school districts of the State. | 
Tt is quite evident that the schools of a county or township can only be organized 
into a harmonious system through the agency of a supervising officer interested 
equally in all the districts of the section. Where this is wanting there is the great- 
est inequality of school facilities and in general the stato of things described by Hon. 
Charles D. Hine, secretary of the board of education of Connecticut, as follows: 
With the facts in full array before us, the difficulty of determining whether there 
has been progress proceeds from the absence of any standard. There is no general 
supervision of schools and no authority which can secure uniform excellence or and 
approach to it. There has not been laid down for the State or any considerable num- 
ber of towns any line or course of study and effort by which they can be measured. 
Hence, every town or district is a law unto itself. The result is absolutely good 
schools in one place and absolutely poor schools in anothtr. It is only by investiga- 
tion of the separate parts in detail and with much labor that every phase of the sub- 
ject is made clear. Many schools have made'rapid strides. Local interest, energetic

and prudent business management, progressive and well educated teachers, have 
pushed them into a high and fortunate position. They cannot be said to represent 
the whole. ‘There is every gradation of the scale, every degree of effort and saccess, 
down to those who have lost hope and purpose under the belief that nothing can be 
done in respect of our educational system and practice. 
These statements, it will be seen, cover experiences in different sections. It is cer- 
tainly no small argument in favor of county superintendency, or its equivalent, that it 
should be so generally advocated by those familiar with the status of elementary 
schools as exhibited throughout entire States. 
UNION OF DISTRICTS AND THE TOWNSHIP SYSTEM. 
The efficiency of the country schools has been greatly promoted in a number of 
counties by the union of districts. In place of the wasteful division of school funds 
among several small districts for the support of schools numbering from two to 
twenty pupils, the funds have been combined and union schools formed or a central 
school established for the older pupils and a few primary schools conveniently placed 
for the younger pupils. 
In a number of States such a union of distriets may be accomplished with little or 
no special legislation ; in others, districts that are desirous of adopting this course 
are prevented by the constitutional requirement that laws regulating the organiza- 
tion of common schools must be uniform throughout the State. So many advantages 
result from the measure where it is practicable that it seems important to provide all 
legal helps to its adoption. 
The experience of the country showing the advantages of the township system over 
the district system has been constantly noted in these reports. The movement in 
favor of the former is extending. The passage of the law abolishing the district sys- 
tem in Massachusetts was mentioned in my last report. Mr. Patterson, of New Hamp- 
shire, observes that several towns have, adopted the town system, and, so far as he 
knows, are pleased with the change, and adds: 
It will readily be seen that the subdivision or district plan defeats measurably the very 
end for which publi schools are established, as it fails to diffuse with an equable 
hand that intelligence which is essential to the safety and highest prosperity of the 
republic. It gives to the minority of the children in villages and cities extraordi- 
nary opportunities, and very ordinary ones to the majority scattered over the country 
towns. It gives to the children of non-taxpaying foreigners concentrated in large 
places privileges which it withholds from the children of taxpaying natives in the 
rural districts. It gives to the child of the man who pays a heavy tax in a small dis- 
trict less schooling than to the child of the man who only pays a poll tax in a large 
one. It renders it supoeshle for a poor man, as the law stands, to live in a district 
with less than 12 weeks of schooling, if he wishes his children to aid in the support 
of the family by work in a factory. 
COURSES OF STUDY AND CLASSIFICATION IN UNGRADED SCHOOLS, 
By means of a definite course of study and a fixed program for each day’s exer- 
cises the work of the ungraded schools is brought into the same systematic, progres- 
sive order as that of the graded schools. When thus regulated, the needs and possi- 
bilities of the school are brought to light and it becomes comparatively easy to show 
what division of the work is desirable. Already this first step in classification has 
Jed in several places to the formation of primary and intermediate classes under sep- 
arate teachers. In California the school law makes it the duty of each county board 
of education to draft a course of study for country schools, which teachers are dom- 
pelled to follow. In this State, as also in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and New Jersey, 
progress in grading the country schools or regulating their work in accordance with 
a fixed program is particularly noticeable. 
As instruction becomes thus systematic there arises a demand for examinations, 
In anumber of counties in different States’ not only are periodical examinations em- 
ployed, but a certificate or diploma is awarded to those who successfully complete the 
prescribed course of study. :
-P-A-G-E-35
  EXAMINATION IN UNGRADED SCHOOLS, XXXV. 
Hon. F. R. Brace, superintendent of schools, Camden County, New Jersey, gives 
the following report of results under this system: 
The work of the past year has generally been satisfactory. In 6 districts pupils 
passed in the advance course of study; in 14, the examination for first grade was 
passed; in 24, the examination for second grade; and in 31, the examination for third 
grade. In only 2 districts was there an entire failure to pass in some one of the grades, 
This is a great adyance on former years. 
The exercises connected with the giving of the diplomas and certificates in the dif- 
ferent districts were gely attended by parents and friends, 
According to scholastic merit, 8 districts are third grade against 13 last year, 12 
second grade against 13 last year, and 20 are first grade against 16 last year. It will 
be seen that there has been quite an advance cure the year. This is due to the 
course of study and the granting of certificates and diplomas. 
Hon. Robert Graham, State superintendent, Wisconsin, has published an outline 
scheme for the examination of pupils who have completed the course of study pre- 
scribed for ungraded schools, to meet an urgent demand from parts of the State where 
the graded course has been successfully introduced. In general, county and State 
superintendents are very active in promoting this part of the work. 
The examinations conducted in Massachusetts by the agents of the State board of 
education have done much to improve the schools and the reports of the same are full 
of helpful suggestions. 
The methods and results of the examination in language as conducted in 1883 by 
Mr. George H. Martin are especially worthy of attention. They show very plainly 
that teachers can best prepare their classes for the ordeal of examination (which, say 
what we may, is an ever present end) by employing those better methods that are 
now so urgently insisted upon. Mr. Martin observes: 
    
     
  In language, I asked the children in grammar and intermediate schools above nine 
years of age to write the following sentence: ‘“‘Many people buy their meat, I think, 
at Mr. Brown’s grocery. Can they buy potatoes there?” This tested their power to 
spell simple words, to punctuate, and to use capital letters. About three thousand 
one hundred papers were examined and the result in each school determined on the 
basis of twenty possible errors, ten in spelling and five each in punctuation and the 
use of capitals. 
He then proceeds to summarize the results, referring to the towns as A,B, C, D, &e. 
(1) The correct use of punctuation marks and possessive forms can only be learned 
by practice in sentence writing, while spelling may be learned in other ways. The 
range of results in punctuation is from 31 to 60 afd in the use of possessive forms 
from 22 to 67, while the range in spelling is only from 68 to 90. 
(2) The benefit of early work in sentence writing is strikingly shown by comparing 
the results in the intermediate schools of two towns. In A the possessive percentage 
reaches 57 in the intermediate schools. This is secured before there has been any 
teaching of grammar. In E, where the language work has been largely subordinated 
to technical grammar, the possessive percentage in the intermediate schools reaches 
27. Stating it in another form, the ratio of children in A at the age of eleven and a 
half years who write the possessive forms correctly is more than double the ratio of 
children in E at the age of nearly twelve years. Indeed, the children in the inter- 
mediate schools of A at the age of eleven and a half years reach a higher per cent. 
(57) than all the children in E at the age of thirteen (51). 
(3) In the towns where the committees have insisted most strongly upon technical 
grammar the children show the least ability to use the proper grammatical form in 
writing. 
(4) Better results may be expected from graded schools than from mixed schools. 
A, C, D, E, F, and G are large towns, with most of the children in graded schools. In 
B, H, and I are many small mixed schools. Yet one mixed school in A reached 83 per 
cent. 
(5) If the school committees want good results in this line of work they can have 
them. The schools in D, E,F, and G are similar in the kind of pupils, in grading, in 
pay of teachers, and in supervision by committees. D has recently introduced into 
its primary schools improved methods of language work. The effect is seen in an 
increased percentage of correct results. B has many mixed schools, and, on the 
whole, its schools are not as good as those in some of the other towns, but its commit- 
tee have during the last year introduced sentence writing into the intermediate schools, 
and have followed it up with a good deal of energy. The effect is seen in making the 
town second in the list. Chas made a specialty of composition writing in all the

grades, and, though the average age of the classes examined is much less than in the 
other towns, its relative rank is high, 
The best results are due to a combination of causes. A, which stands highest in 
the list, has a comparatively fixed population, has never had the district system, has 
for thirty years welcomed normal teachers, pays the best salaries in the county, and 
for several years has employed superintendents who have been enthusiastic in intro- 
ducing improved methods of primary work. I, which is lowest on the list, has a large 
floating population, has chiefly mixed schools, employs few normal teachers, and 
pays low wages. The schools have little supervision and are using old methods 
almost exclusively. The difference between these towns is well shown by the fact 
that in I less than 14 per cent. of the pupils wrote the sentence without mistake, 
while in A 12 per cent. thus wrote it. 
Several causes have combined to stimulate to increased work in language teaching. 
One is the publication of the results of the examinations made by Mr. Walton, an 
agent of the board, in Norfolk and Bristol Counties, by which public attention was 
called to existing defects. Another is the work that has been done for several years 
in the normal schools and in the teachers’ institutes held by the board in different 
parts of the State. A third is the liberal advertising of the schools of Quincy, where 
the methods presented and advocated in the institutes and normal schools, and al- 
ready in general use in other cities and schools, were put into practice and held con- 
spicuously before the public. The public hastened to name them ‘the Quincey meth- 
ods,” as America was called after him who advertised it rather than after him who 
found it. But this was of little consequence as long as committees and teachers, from 
actual observation, became convinced of the value of the work and took it up in their 
own schools. My examinations show that the towns which have adopted these 
methods most cordially and have applied them most judiciously have the best schools.    
  
  Grading in the country schools leads very naturally to provision for branches a lit- 
tle in advance of those that the school laws make obligatory, prevents the early 
withdrawal of pupils, and increases the number who advance to the high school. It 
appears also upon a careful examination of school finances that grading is an econom- 
ical provision. For instance, in Illinois it has been ascertained that the cost of 
tuition per pupil in average attendance is, for graded schools, $11.37; for ungraded, 
$11.85. At the same time the salaries for teachers of ungraded schools are much 
lower than for teachers of graded schools, the average being for male teachers $6.80 
in the graded, as against $40.95 in the ungraded schools, and for female teachers, 
$48.88, as against $31.21. 
The following statement is from the report of the Connecticut board of education 
for 1884: 
The money now expended for schools in this State, when divided by the total num- 
ber of children in attendance, is equal to the cost per bead of educating the children 
of New Haven, about $22 per head. The cost of educat ng the childre 3 
districts which have less than eight scholars in attendance during the year was $30 
per head. Now, if we compare the educational chances of a child who is one of the 
eight scholars in a remote wayside school-house with the educational chances of a 
child in one of the New Haven public schools, and note that the cost of educating 
the latter is only the average cost of education over the whole State, we certainly 
see that there is a grand chance for intelligent effort to so organize the schools as to 
level up the school training while preserving the average cost. We may go further 
and say that there is a duty here which those in charge of the matter cannot avoid. 
Some of those who are best fitted to form an opinion on the subject affirm that if the 
schools of the towns can be consolidated the standard of instruction can be raised as 
high as that in the best city schools, and at no greater expens n now. The 
board hopes to bring this matter to public attention, to promote discussion of it, and 
to induce the towns atid districts to enter voluntarily upon the experiment.       
        
    Hon. Herschel R. Gass, superintendent of public instruction, Michigan, calls at- 
tention to the same subject as follows: 
With an impartial, eflicient board of education to take charge of all the schools in the township, the districts would be arranged and school sites would be located with 
a view to aflording the best advantages possible to those attending school. Sneha 
board would be uninfluenced by the local prejudices that are so fieqnently manifested 
in the management of the district schools. They would have’ control of ali the schools in their jurisdiction and would ‘be responsible for their success or failure. The burden of school tax would be equitably @istHbutld throughout the township 
and each district would recive more nearly an qual portion of all the pupils en-

  rolled. Better houses would be erected and a more competent class of teachers 
would be employed, since no local penny policy would dictate in these matters. This 
does not imply an extravagant expenditure of school moneys or even an increase in 
the cost of schools. In fact, I think it can be shown that this plan would be the 
most economical. As evidence of this I would call attention to the following facts: 
In Oakland County, in the year 1882~83, were taught 14 schools, in which the 
number of pupils enrolled ranged from 4 to 12._The whole number of resident pupils 
attending these schools was one hundred and six. An average of six months’ school 
was taught in each district during the year at a cost of $16.50 per month. Each 
school averaged 7.5 scholars, and it cost $2.10 a month to instruct each pupil, or at 
the rate of $21 per year. Twenty-one different teachers were employed in these 14 
schools during this period, and the average length of time each taught was four 
months. The smallest number enrolled in any of these schools was 4; 3 of these 4 
were non-resident pupils, and for instructing one scholar three months it cost the 
district $60. In the same county there were 33 schools that enrolled from 12 to 20 
scholars each. There was an average of 16.6 pupils in each school. Fifty-two 
Tenniats were employed in these schools, and an average of five months was taught 
by each, 
In Washtenaw County 6 schools were taught, with an average attendance of 
9.6 pupils. The average cost per month for teaching each pupil was $2. Twelve 
teachers were employed, and they taught an average of 3.6 months each, 
No account has been taken of the incidental expenses incurred in these schools. 
The cost of instruction alone is nearly twice a8 much per pupil as it averages in all 
the graded schools of the State, including high school instruction, -This condition of 
things is not peculiar to the counties mentioned. A similar showing could be made 
from nearly every county in the State. This exhibit indicates that our district sys- 
tem is not the most economical in the expenditure of labor or the disbursement of 
mouey. 
    
NEEDS OF SPARSELY SETTLED DISTRICTS. 
There are many sections of the country in which, on account of the sparse popula. 
tion or natural barriers, districts cannot combine their resources, although the indi- 
vidual districts are not able to maintain efficient schools. How the school children 
of these localities can be properly cared for is a serious question. It is quite evident 
that the funds available for schools in such cases must be increased or temporary 
expedients—as, for instance, house to house instruction—be employed. All things 
considered, it would seem better for the State or the General Government to extend 
the needed aid and support the work upon a basis that is likely to be permanent. 
The views expressed by Hon. Neil Gilmour, superintendent of public instruction, 
New York, with reference to the needs of such districts in his own State, are appli- 
cable to almost every State in the Union: 
I have heretofore called the attention of the legislature to the fact that we have 
many districts in which the assessed valuation of property does not exceed $5,000, 
and many more in which such valuation is not more than $10,000. Such districts 
cannot, without overburdening themselves by taxation, employ as the teachers of 
their schools persons who have been thoroughly trained or who have had experience 
in the profession. And yet it seerms necessary that such districts should exist, for, if 
they were to be wiped out through consolidation with other districts or otherwise, 
many children would be deprived of even the meagre school privileges they now 
possess, by reason of the remoteness of their residence from the nearest school. So, 
under present laws, the class of districts described will continue to exist, will be 
served by cheap and inefficient teachers, and will be no credit, but rather a reproach, 
to our school system. There is a remedy for this condition of affairs, and it is within 
the power of the legislature to apply it. The department of public instruction is 
really powerless in the matter. The superintendent may, by causing stringent exam- 
inations of applicants for teachers’ certilicates to be made and by directing that none 
but those who pass such examinations satisfactorily be licensed to teach, raise the 
standard of qualification, but he cannot compel the teachers who pass the examina- 
tion to accept starvation wages for the purpose of instructing children in a weak dis- 
trict, nor can he compel the officers or inhabitants of such a district to employ a 
teacher upon wages which would afford adequate compensation for time and money 
expended by the teacher in acquiring skill in the profession, Enough skilful and 
competent teachers can be obtained to supply all the schools in the State, to the 
reat advantage of those who attend them, but, if this policy is to be pursued, the 
State tax for the support of schools must. be largely increased and the laws regu- 
lating the distribution of school moneys so changed as to give to the State superin- 
tendent and the school commissioners in the several counties greater discretionary 
powers than they now possess. The schools can be made good; those in the rural

districts can be made to rival those in cities and villages; but this can be accom- 
plished only by the expenditure of much more money than is now annually appropri- 
ated by the legislature for educational purposes. 
TEACHING FORCE. 
The efforts made within the last few years to improve the teaching force of the 
country schools have had some degree of success. It is now required in all the States 
that candidates for the service shall pass the examination for a teacher’s certificate 
or present the diploma of a normal school. It remains to raise the standard fixed for 
the lowest certificate (which represents virtually the average qualification of the 
teachers), to remove the examination from local and partisan influences, and to offer 
fair wages for competent teachers. In a few localities this has been done, but, as a 
rule, the tests of qualification, the modes of appointment, and the inducements offered 
competent teachers to remain in the work are not such as sbould satisfy an intelli- 
gent people. The most hopeful indication in the matter is the very general effort 
made byschool officers to arrive at an understanding of the exact status of the teach- 
ing force in the several States. Since the improvement of the service rests wholly 
with the people, every means should be employed to get the facts thus brought to 
light before their attention. The following information presents the results of recent 
inquiries into this subject in the States specified: 
In Kansas there is a steady increase in the number of teachers’ certificates granted 
above the third or lowest grade. 
Hon. E. A. Apgar, State superintendent of public instruction, New Jersey, in his 
report for 1883, says: 
The total number of State certificates held is 296, of which 113 are of the first grade, 
135 of the second, and 48 of the third. This is a decrease of 1 first grade, an increase 
of 16 second grade, and an increase of 8 third grade —a total increase of 23 State cer- 
tificates. The total number of county certificates is 1,950, of which 411 are of the first 
grade, 488 of the second grade, and 1,051 of the third grade, being the same number 
of first grade, an increase of 65 second grade, and a decrease of 96 third grade —a total 
decrease of 31. The total number of city certificates is 1,245, of which 653 are of the 
first grade, 371 of the second grade, and 221 of the third grade, being an increase of 
6 first grade, an increase of 33 second grade, and a decrease of 22 third grade —a total 
increase of 31. Thirty-three teachers are without certificates, an increase of 3. Seven 
teachers hold special certificates, an increase of 5. Of these, 5 are in Hudson County, 
lin Monmouth, and 1 in Union. Three per cent. of the total number held are first 
grade State, the same as last year; 4 per cent. are second grade State, an increase 
of 1 per cent.; 1 per cent. are third grade State, the same as last year; 12 per cent. 
are first grade county, an increase of 1 per cent. ; 14 per cent. are second grade county, 
an increase of 1 per cent. ; 30 per cent. are third grade county, a decrease of 3 per cent. ; 
19 per cent. are first grade city, the same as last year; 11 per cent. are second grade 
city, an increaso of 1 per cent.; 6 per cent. are third grade city, a decrease of 1 per 
cent.

TEACHING FORCE. XXXIX 
The commissioner in his last report observes + 
There is still the same tendency to change teachers which has been noticed before, 
nearly one-third of the whole number in the State having changed their location during 
the ye: If now we drop out of our calculation the towns where the town, system 
prevails, we find that nearly one-half of the teachers in the remaining towns, where 
the district systew holds sway, are changed during the year. Is it any wonder that 
the results of the schools are sometimes poor and discreditable? Iam more inclined 
to think that the wonder should be.that they have accomplished anything. Surely 
there is an evil here which demands immediate attention, and it seems very clear to 
me that the remedy lies along the line of a change in the manner of employing the 
teachers, also of determining their fitness. 
From every point of view and from every consideration which looks to securing a 
thorough and business-like administration of the affairs of the schools, there is a 
united demand that the business of selecting and hiring teachers be placed in the 
hands of but one party instead of two as it is now, and that this appointing power 
be as far removed as possible from all liabilities to be unduly warped or influenced 
by improper motives. The other point, that of the determination of the qualifica- 
tions of the teacher, must be reached by means of a system of State certificates, 
which shall be issued upon the two distinct bases of scholarship and successful ex- 
perience. These two alterations in the laws would immediately tend to produce a’ 
higher standard of character and ability among the teachers and also a more per- 
manent and satisfactory tenure of position. 
A careful examination of the statistics relating to the education of the teachers 
shows a general advance over the report of last year. It is especially gratifying to 
note that the largest increase in any one grade is in the number of those who have 
hada normal school training, a little more than 25 per cent, of the whole number hay- 
ing had that preparation for their work. Comparing still further this number with 
the ratio of normal school graduates to the number of new teachers, which is less 
than one-fifth, we see that the great body of normal graduates hold to their work 
more steadfastly than others. This, of course, should be so, but we are especially 
pleased to note that the fact is in confirmation of the theory. This is probably due, 
in the first place, to the fact that they are retained in their positions owing to the 
excellence of their work, and, secondly, because they have a professional spirit which 
animates them and tends to keep them in its active pursuit. 
Hon. E. E. Higbee, superintendent of public instruction for Pennsylvania, diseuss- 
ing the status of the teaching force of his State, observes: 
It is no easy task to supply with a competent teaching force a State like ours, 
where more than twenty-two thousand teachers are constantly required to keep the 
schools in operation. When we bear in mind our present low average of salaries 
(males, $37.28; females, $29.22) and the uncertain tenure of office, both of which deter 
young men and women either from entering the profession or from remaining long 
therein, we have reason to congratulate ourselves that the needed supply is so 
promptly met and that the degree of attainment and professional skill is so ‘high as 
it is. 
For our general school work we get but very few teachers from our colleges. In 
very many of our high schools and in our State normal schools, we find, it is true, 
college graduates doing very efficient work, but in our other schools, where the 
primary grades demand most attention and where the highest professional skill is 
required that the foundation may be firm and a right impulse and tendency be given 
for the whole subsequent work, we have to rely upon resources within the public 
school system itself and not upon any helps which may come from abroad. On this 
account our State normal schools are a necessity as a constitutive part of the publie 
school work, without which, indeed, the whole interest could have no safe warrant 
of self perpetuation. * * * Their challenge to the legislature should be that 
they are a necessary part of the public school system of the State; that a proper 
supply of well trained professional teachers will be impossible without them; and 
that the State ought, as other States are doing, so far to maintain them as to make 
them the most efficient possible in their special work. 
The report of Hon. Henry Raab, superintendent of public instruction, Dlinois, pre- 
sents very full statistics of the teaching force of that State. The collection of these 
statistics is due to Hon. W. L. Pillsbury, the assistant superintendent, who says: 
From an analysis of the tabulated results of the investigation 1t appears : 
(1) With reference to the nativity of the teachers employed in the State, that 60 per 
cent. of the whole number were born in the State; but of the men teaching in graded 
schools the larger number were natives of other States or countries. 
(2) With reference to age, that the teachers of the graded schools averaged about 
5 years older than the teachers’in the ungraded schools, Seven and one-half per 
         
-P-A-G-E-40
  XL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
cent. of the teachers were minors; but.in 44 counties all and in the State 93 per cent. 
of the minors were employed in the ungraded schools. 3 
(3) With reference to experience: Under this head it should be observed that the 
way in which the statements were taken gives substantially the experience at the 
beginning of the school year, and the time taught during the year added would raise 
the average experience about 8} months for graded school teachers and about 5} 
months for teachers in ungraded schools, making the averages for the State about as 
follows: Average for male teachers in graded schools, 81.5 months; average for female ~ 
teachers in graded schools, 59.5 months; average for male teachers in ungraded schools, 
34.5 months; average for female teachers in ungraded schools, 21.5 months. 
(4) The following shows the percentage of those who, at the beginning of the year, 
had had no previous experience: Men in graded schools, 45, or 4.5 per cent. ; women in 
graded schools, 406, or 8.9 per cent.; men in ungraded schools, 1,050, or 20.4 per cent. ; 
women in ungraded schools, 2,125, or 29.8 per cent. 
The following shows those who had not taught more than ten months, including 
beginners: Men in graded schools, 102, or 10 per cent. ; women in graded schools, 976, 
or 21.3 per cent. ; men in ungraded schools, 2,101, or 41 per cent. ; women in ungraded 
schools, 4,036, or 56.5 per cent. 
It is evident that the number who have chosen teaching as. a profession is very 
small. It appears, too, that of the 3,626 beginners 87.6 per cent. were employed in 
the ungraded schools, and of the 7,227 whose experience did not exceed ten months, 
ineluding beginners, 85 per cent. were employed in the ungraded schools, and that 
they were one-half of the teachers of these schools. 
(5) With reference to the training of teachers: The whole number who had received 
special training was but 2,388, or 13.4 per cent, Teachers who had attended some 
school for professional training were distributed among the four classes of teachers 
as follows: Men in graded schools, 236, or 22.8 per cent.; women in graded schools, 
991, or 21.6 per cent. ; men in ungraded schools, 555, or 10.8 per cent. ; women in un- 
graded schools, 606, or 8.5 per cent. It is shown that 9,055, or 50.6 per cent., of the 
teachers had received secondary instruction. Of these, 5,344, or 59 per cent., had 
received such instruction in the high schools. 
The teachers who had received secondary, instruction were employed as follows: 
Men in graded schools, 620, or 60 per cent.; women in graded schools, 3,103, or 67.2 
per cent.; men in ungraded schools, 2,200, or 42.9 per cent.; women in ungraded 
schools, 3,282, or 45.3 per cent.: 6,847, or 38.3 per cent., of the teachers had received 
neither secondary nor normal school instruction. These were divided among the four 
classes of teachers as follows: Men in graded schools, 187, or 18 per cent.; women in 
graded schools, 914, or 20 per cent. ; men in ungraded schools, 2,338, or 45.6 per cent. ; 
women in ungraded schools, 3,408, or 47.7 per cent. Of this class of teachers, 1,755, 
or 25.6 per cent. of them, were beginners, and these untrained teachers comprised 
48.3 per cent. of all beginners. The men and women of this class, viz, untrained 
beginners, were distributed as follows: Men in graded schools, 15, or .8 per cent. ; 
women in graded schools, 112, or 6.4 per cent. ; men in ungraded schools, 503, or 28.7 
per cent.; women in ungraded schools, 1,125, or 64.1 per cent. Compared with the 
whole number of teachers in each class there were belonging to the class of untrained 
beginners: Men in graded schools, 1.5 per cent.; women in graded schools, 2.4 per 
cent.; men in ungraded schools, 9.8 per cent. ; women in ungraded schools, 15.8 per 
cent. 
As was to be expected, the number of teachers who had enjoyed superior instruc- 
tion was not large. The number of men and women of this class and per cent. of 
them employed in each class of schools were as follows: Men in graded schools, 302, 
or 33.5 per cent.; women in graded schools, 300, or 33.2 per cent. ; men in ungraded 
schools, 212, or 23.5 per cent. ; women in ungraded schools, 89, or 9.8 per cent. And, 
comparing with the whole number of teachers in each class, there were belonging to 
this class: Men in graded schools, 29.3 per cent. ; women in graded schools, 6.5 per 
cent.; men in ungraded schools, 4.1 per cent.; women in ungraded schools, 1.2 per 
cent, Here again, as among those who have attended normal schools and schools of 
secondary. instruction, the graded schools get by far the larger proportion of the 
graduates, 
      RURAL SCHOOL-ILOUSES. 
Within a few years there has been marked improvement in country school-houses, 
and much greater attention than formerly has been paid to the sanitary conditions 
of the same and to the general care of buildings and premises. 
The following descriptions of school-houses recently built answer a number of 
jnquiries received at this Office. ‘A’ :is located in Litchfield, Connecticut; the de- 
scription is taken from the report of the ‘secretary of the State board of education, 
Hon. Charles D, Hine, for 1884. “B” is locatedviny Franklin County, Ohio; the
-P-A-G-E-41
  PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION, XLI 
description is taken from the report of the State commissioner, Hon. Le Roy D. 
Brown, for 1884: . 
“A.”—The outside dimensions are 20 by 30; 11-foot posts. It is designed to seat 
twenty-four scholars. There will be floor room enough for six or eight more, but the 
room is not intended for that. 
There are two blackboards, or black walls, one on each end, 12 feet long, 3 feet wide. 
The contract for building in good and complete style was $600, cellar and all. The 
lot cost $50, seats $50, outbuildings $50, and other minor expenses about $50, making 
total cost about $800. It is built of the best material and every way first class. The 
school room is 193 by 194, plastered two coats, wainscoted up 3 feet. The boys and 
girls’ entries are separate, each 9 by 7 feet, and ceiled with spruce. The closet be- 
tween these is to store maps or library. The outbuildings are 50 feet in rear of the 
school-house. 
“B.”—This building is built of brick and stone, with pressed brick arches, slate 
roof, and slate blackboards. It is a one-room building, with rear and left hand light; 
seating capacity for from forty-eight to fifty pupils. The flues are laid for ventilating 
stoves by taking fresh air from the outside by a register in the floor directly under 
the stove. There are two flues in the chimneys, one for the smoke and the other for 
ventilation, with register at floor line. Cost, $2,000. 
INSTRUCTION IN TEMPERANCE, HYGIENE, &0. 
The evils resulting from the use of alcoholic liquors are so terrible that all practi- 
cable repressive measures should receive the support of the people. How far in- 
struction in the physiological effects of these beverages will prevent their use is not 
easy to determine. The very general conviction that such instruction will act as a 
restraint certainly ought not to be disregarded. Several States, viz, New Hamp- 
shire, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, and Michigan, have by special enactment 
made such instruction obligatory. In some other States, as, for instance, Massachu- 
setts, instruction in physiology, hygiene, and temperance has long been required. 
During the past year an effort was made by the Massachusetts board of education 
to learn to what extent the description of the physiological effects of alcohol is in- 
cluded in such instruction in the normal schools of the State. The principals of 
the several schools were requested to furnish to the board outlines of their respective 
work, which request was promptly complied with. From these outlines, it appears 
that more or less attention is given to the subject by all the schools; and, in a ma- 
jority of them, the instruction indicated is fairly adequate to the importance of the 
subject and the circumstances under which it is given. 
BRIEF SUMMARY OF. THE EDUCATIONAL CONDITION OF THE UNION. 
NEW ENGLAND STATES— MAINE. 
Expenditure for schools, school-houses, farniture, and supervision increased here 
considerably in 1882-83 and again in 1883~84; more schools had higher studies un- 
der better teachers, stimulated to good work by better pay, and in city schools and 
free high schools there are evidences of fair advance in both years. But the number 
of school districts, perhaps from consolidation of small ones, is becoming fewer}; 
youth of school age have been lessening in number, with exceptions in ‘only two 
years since 1870; and the length of school terms is shortening by about a day each 
year. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
Gains over 1881-’82 appear in both thé-succeeding years as respects enrolment in 
public and in private schools, in the number of schools and the time that they were 
open, in the pay of teachers, and in the general expenditure for public schools. In 
1882~63 there was also a considerable advance in-the average attendance, which, 
however, fell off again by 2,348 in the next year, apparently in part through a trans- 
fer of pupils from public to private or church schools. In the fact that school dis- 
tricts were less numerous there is also evidence of gain, as the number of such dis- 
tricts, small and poorin many places, has been a great hindrauce to educational success. 
The superintendent sees encouragement, too, in an annually increased supply of funds 
for schools, in a demand for’éxperienced teachors, ina greater appreciation of im- 
proved methods of instruction, and in a fostering of these through educational meet- 
ings and institutes,

XLIt REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
VERMONT. 
Tn both years here enrolment in public schools and averageé attendance in them fell 
off from what it had been in the two preceding years; but the per cent. of enrol- 
ment to school youth remained still very fair (73.23 and 73.68) in view of the broad 
limits of school age, and the per cent. of average attendance to such youth (46.36 and 
47.85) was also fair for a State often swept during school times by bleak wintry winds. 
School districts in both years diminished, but this was largely from abandonment of 
the poor district system for the better town one, in which fairly graded schools come 
often in place of miserable ungraded ones; and hence, with 3 fewer schools, there were 
33 graded ones. Expenditure for public schools increased considerably in both years, 
and teachers, both male and female, were-stimulated by better average pay. 
  MASSACHUSETTS. 
Children of school age (5-15) increased in this Commonwealth,in 1882~'83 by 8,082 
from the number reported in 1881~’82, and, as usual, a much larger number than the 
youth of school age was brought into the public schools, the per cent. of enrolment 
to school youth being 101.95. The next year, when 6,736 more school youth were 
reported, the enrolment rose to 6,140 beyond that in the year before, making a per 
cent. of 101.73 to the whole number of school age. The per cent. of average attend- 
ance to average membership and of average attendance to school youth (89.47 and 
89.51 in the former case, 73.47 and 73.82 in the latter) is, in its way, equally remark- 
able. Adding the attendance in State charitable and reformatory institutions, that 
in the numerous evening schools, and that in academies and private schools, the edu- 
cational status is exceedingly high. 
BHODE ISLAND, 
The secretary of the State board of education thinks that the general condition of the 
schools is most hopeful, and the figures of his reports for 1882~83 and 1883~84 appear to 
justify his judgment, forthe per cent. of enrolled pupils to youth of school agerose from 
73.07 in the former year to 77.54 in the latter, and the per cent. of daily attendance 
to such youth from 48.89 to 52.24, the number in all schools, private and public, com- 
ing in both years close up to the whole number of school age. A new compulsory 
law, passed in 1883, had, doubtless, some effect on this increase of attendance; but 
the State school commissioner thinks that it was much more the result of better 
teaching, increased attractiveness in the schools, and wider interest in education. 
CONNECTICUT, 
In 1882~83, with more children for instruction, there was asomewhat smaller enrol- 
ment in public schools, with a smaller per cent. of attendance in all schools than in 
1881~82, but average attendance increased by 1,437, total attendance in all schools by 
1,213, a new and elegant State Normal School was built, and great improvements in 
school buildings at Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and elsewhere were made at a 
cost of $565,752. 
The next year, with a very small increase of school youth and a diminution in the 
number attending other than public schools, there was an increase of 2,843 in public 
school enrolment and of 1,652 in average attendance in the winter term, children in 
no school diminishing by 335. Then, too, though it was a year of calamity in busi- 
ness, 5 more public schools were opened, 18 more graded schools were taught, the 
departments in these numbering 44, and the State school property was rated almost 
$1,000,000 higher. 
MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES—NEW YORK. 
The school year 188384 was an exceptional one in this State, in that it was shorter 
by about 6 weeks than usual, owing to the fact that the legislature in 1883 changed 
the day of its close from September 30 to August 20, This will account for a falling

off in certain statistical details which, from their nature, are necessarily affected by 
time. In particulars not thus affected, the reports show decided improvement over 
the year preceding, while the public school work in 1882~’83 had also improved in 
many respects over that of 1881~82. With about 41,000 fewer pupils enrolled in 
188384, the average daily attendance was 13,000 greater, the per cent. of attend- 
ance based onenrolment was greater by 3.60, and the same, based on the whole num- 
ber of youth of school age, was .40 of 1 per cent. greater. More teachers were 
employed 23 weeks or over, although the whole number was less, and more attended 
the institutes. Over $177,000 more were expended for sites, buildings, and furni- 
ture, the estimated value of all public school property reaching nearly $32,000,000. 
NEW JERSEY, 
During 188283 there were in this State over 349,000 youth of legal school age 
(5-18), of whom nearly 212,000 were enrolled in public schools and nearly 120,000 
were in average daily attendance, the per cent. of public school enrolment to the num- 
ber of school youth being 60.69 and that of average attendance to school population 
34.22. Counting the enrolment in private and church schools, there were 260,612, or 
74.62 per cent., engaged in study during some portion.of the year. The records for 
1883~84 having been consumed in a conflagration at the State House, figures for 
illustration of educational progress in that year are wanting. 
PENNSYLVANIA. . 
The public school statistics for 1882-83 and 1883~’84 show an advance during 
the latter year in nearly all particulars. Over 8,000 more youth were enrolled in the 
schools and over 9,000 more were in average daily attendance, the enrolment in 
schools other than public having, meanwhile, decreased by 2,527. The proportion of 
public school pupils in average attendance to the number enrolled was 65.80, to 
the number of youth of school age (census of 1880) was 44.69, a slight increase in 
both items over the figures of 1882-83. Nearly 20,000 free schools were taught in 
2,241 school districts, 8,345 of the schools being graded, an increase for the year in 
districts and in schools, both graded and ungraded. Over nine millions and a half 
were expended for all public school purposes, the increase for the year being more 
than $210,000. Still, the average monthly pay of a large majority of the teachers— 
the women—was over half a dollar less than the previous year (that of the men em- 
ployed having advanced $1.44), and this notwithstanding a decided advance in the 
number of teachers employed continuously and in normal school graduates. 
DELAWARE. 
The State superintendent reported in 1884 that the public sentiment in favor of the 
support of free schools was stronger than it had ever before been; that the public 
press and the leading men of all parties and creeds acknowledged and insisted on the 
duty of the State to provide a good common school education for the children of all 
classes. The statistics show an enrolment of about 31,000 pupils in the public schools 
in 1884, including schools for colored youth, a gain of about 4,300 in two years, the 
whole school population of both races (numbering a little oyer 40,500) having only 
inereased by about 2,000. The exact number of white children enrolled was 27,037, 
a gain of 3,587 over 1882; the average daily attendance of the same class (17,952) in- 
creased 2,396. The length of term remained about the same in both classes of schools, 
that for white children numbering 157 days, that for colored 104. The whole cost of 
sustaining the white schools was $206,918; that for the colored schools, $8,243. 
MARYLAND, 
About 55 per cent. of the youth of school age in this State were enrolled in public 
schools, about 28 per cent. of them being in average daily attendance. The number 
enrolled (170,393) included anincrease during the year of 8,634 ; that in average attend-

ance, (86,486), one of 1,166. Of the whole number enrolled, 31,327 were colored, and 
12,574 of that race were in average daily attendance, a fair advance for the year in both 
these items. Still, the percent. of average daily attendance to youth of school age for 
white and colored remained about the same for the two years, scarcely reaching, as 
before said, 28 per cent. The schools remained in session during both years 182 days, 
but in 1883~84 there were 36 more taught. Over $117,000 more were expended for 
all public school purposes and nearly $50,000 more for teachers’ salaries alone. 
The board of education expresses satisfaction, on the whole, with the progress made 
during the year. The smallness of gain in average attendance in proportion to that 
of enrolment is explained by the severity of the winter, the bad condition of the 
roads, and the prevalence of contagious diseases, 
VIRGINIA. 
The statistics of the two ycars ending 1884 show a continuation of the prosperous 
condition heretofore reported in public school affairs. There were, in round numbers, 
an enrolment of 288,000 children, of whom 103,000 were colored, and an average at- 
tendance of about 163,000, an increase for the year in enrolment of 7,000 white and 
12,000 colored children and in average attendance of 4,700 white and 7,600 colored 
children. Still, the per cent. of school population enrolled (based on the census of 
1880) did not quite reach 52, and that in average daily attendance was only 29.39. 
There were 376 more schools taught (158 more for colored youth) and nearly $24,000 
more were expended for all public school purposes. The average monthly pay of 
teachers increased slightly (70 cents for men and 55 for women), more school-honses 
were owned by districts, and the valuation of property increased by nearly $150,000. 
SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES—NORTH CAROLINA. 
The improved school law of 1881, referred to in the report of 1882, showed its good 
effects in the 2 years succeeding that report, although some part of those effects lack 
illustration from the failure of several counties to make the required returns. But, 
even with this drawback, the figures for the 2 years are almost wholly on the gaining 
side, especially in the latter year, 35,723 more school youth appearing, 37,554 more 
enrolled in the free schools, and 17,043 more in average attendance, with 494 more 
schools, under 719 more teachers. The teachers, more than ever before, were trained 
to better methods of instruction through institutes and normal schools. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Based on the school population as given by the United States Census of 1880, tho 
enrolment for 1882~83 was 66 per cent. of school youth and average attendance 42 
per cent., increased respectively to 71 and 44 per cent. in 1883-84. The increase in 
enrolment in public schools in 188283 was 27,121, and in 1883-84 it was 12,524. 
Average daily attendance in the former year was better, increasing by 9,180, but in 
the latter by only 3,148. Additional houses for public schools in both years were pro- 
vided in fair proportion to the need of increased accommodations, but very few 
of them were owned by the districts in which they stand, and the valuation of them 
all was $32,435 less in 1883-84 than in the previous year. 
GEORGIA. 
This State presents statistics for only one year beyond those of the last report, but 
for that year shows an increase of 11,414 in children of school age, of 30,979 in enrol- 
ment in public schools, of 24,191 in average daily attendance in such schools, of 380 
in the schools to accommodate this large attendance, of 32 in the number of graded 
and high schools in the public system, .and of $29,473 in the expenditure for all the 
State free schools. These are but specimens of a growth in all important points that 
has gone on under the supervision of an excellent, State, school commissioner for ten 
years. The evidence of improvement in other schools than those of the State system,

including several colleges, does not appear; but this is partly from the fact that 
these schools, not beiug compelled to make reports to the commissioner, in very many 
cases fail to do so. 
FLORIDA. 
The educational reports of the State of Florida have been imperfect for some 
years past, and even yet 9 counties fail to present statistics of their schools, if they 
have any. But a new era is evidently opening, promising a much better condition 
of affairs. The State report for 1883-84 shows a great increase of interest in educa- 
tion (1) in an apparent foundation of the long talked of State university; (2) in the 
establishment of 2 new normal schools for colered teachers and in improved instrue- 
tion for white teachers in the East and West State seminaries; (3) in an appro- 
priation by the State of $1,000 each year, for 2 years, for the better training of 
teachers in a succession of teachers’ institutes, with competent instructors; (4) ina 
new law requiring county boards of education to sefect and use, for at least 5 years, 
a uniform series of text books for their schools. These things, with an increased 
number of State schools and of pupils in them in the years under review, give prom- 
ise of better schools and better teachers. 
GULF STATES— ALABAMA, 
A general advance in public school interests was reported for the two years 1382~83 
and 1883-84. In the former year, with less than 3,000 more youth of school age, 
23,000 more pupils were enrolled and over 12,000 more were in average daily attend- 
ance. There was also a corresponding increase in the number of schools and teachers ; 
two additional normal schools were established ; there was an improvement in county 
teachers’ institutes, with a growth of educational interest\among the people. In 
1883-84, with about 15,800 more youth of school age reported, there were about 15,000 
more enrolled in public schools and 7,400 more were in average daily attendance. 
About 51 per cent. of the whole school population were enrolled, and about 62 per 
cent. of these were in average attendance. There was an increase in tho number of 
public schools tanght for white and colored, in the average school term for the State, 
and in the whole amount expended for public schools. 
MISSISSIPPI. 
  The State superintendent of public instruction in Mississippi reports that the snbject 
of education engrossed unusual attention during 1882 and 1883, both as regards public 
and private instruction ; and that public education was growing in the estimation of 
the people, as shown by their willingness to pay the school tax, their desire to extend 
the school term beyond the constitutional limit of 4 months, as well as by a desire to 
employ competent teachers. 
With 447,571 youth of legal school age (of whom about 180,000 were white and 
over 267,000 colored) there were enrolled in 1883, in public schools, about 125,600 
white children and over 141,000 colored, and 154,463 of the whole number were in 
average daily attendance, an increase for the year of nearly 53,000 in enrolment 
and about 19,000 in average attendance, with only 3,440 more youth of school age. 
The per cent. of children enrolled, based on the whole school population, was 59.65 
and that in average attendance * To meet this inereased attendance more 
teachers of each race were employed and over $123,000 more were expended on the 
schools, the whole amount used for all school purposes being $303,876.

The public school statistics from this State are incomplete, and those given are not 
at all encouraging, showing, as they do, only 55,838 enrolled and 38,615 in average

atteadance during 1883-84, with about 291,000 youth of school age (6-18). The percent. 
of youth of school age enrolled was only 19.25 and that in average attendance 13.31. 
There were 4,430 fewer colored youth enrolled than in 1882-’83 and only 777 more 
white youth, a decrease in all of 3,653. More public schools were reported, however, 
and $57,878 more were expended onthem. Encouragement for the future was drawn 
from the fact that the legislature in 1884 increased the State appropriation for public 
schools from one mill to one mill and a half on the dollar, which it is supposed will 
add about $100,000 to the school revenue. It also stopped the diversion of the school 
fund to collegiate purposes, a practice which had in the past much lessened the funds 
available for public schools. 
TEXAS. 
  The public school statistics from this State for 1883-’24, as far as presented (41 
counties failing to report), show about 244,800 children enrolled in public schools, of 
whom about 56,000 were colored; over 5,800 schools sustained, at a cost of $1,661,476, 
for an average term of 100 days, 1,432 of these schools being for colored children; an 
increase for the year of about 61,000 children enrolled, with only about 15,000 more 
of legal school age, although the age was in 1883 extended two years by the legis- 
lature, to include all between 8 and 16, instead of, as formerly, between 8 and 14, 
Whether or not fuller reports would have changed materially the results of the above 
comparison cannot be known. The State superintendent, however, confirms the 
favorable indications of the statistics, saying that during the two years under review 
the cause of popular education was unusually prosperous and expressing the belief 
that free schools have passed the experimental stage and have so firmly fixed them- 
selves in public esteem as to stand in no danger of discontinuance. 
SOUTHERN CENTRAL STATES— ARKANSAS. 
The statistics given of this large State show progress, but not such as might be had 
under a better school law. In 1882~83, with 14,345 more school children enumerated, 
there appears a falling off of 5,463 in public school enrolment from that of the year 
before. In 1853-84, with only 12,394 more children, the reported enrolment was 
40,983 greater, though many districts failed to report this. Expenditure for schools 
seems also to have increased considerably, though 8 counties did not report it. Val- 
uation of State school property was $457,581 higher, 9 counties not reporting. These 
irregularities make the rate of progress uncertain, and the State superintendent calls 
on the legislature for an improved school law, to give county superintendency, bet- 
ter examiners of teachers, free text books, and more funds for schools. Reports of 
average daily attendance ought also to be required as vital to an understanding of 
the condition of the schools. 
KANbAS. 
Statistics here, as previously, present us a steady and fairly uniform advance in 
school youth, enrolment, average attendance, organized districts, districts maintaining 
school 3 months, number of school rooms, valuation of school property, expenditure 
for public schools and normal institutes, as well as in teachers holding normal school 
diplomas or State certificates of qualification, These are good fruits from a good 
school law, apparently well administered. If there is failure anywhere it seems to be 
in lack of provision for good institute instruction in some of the poorer western 
counties, where such instruction is especially desirable. In 1883 there were 74 insti- 
tutes held in as many counties, with at least 50 members each, the sessions being 
each of 4 weeks or over and the enrolment 6,770. In 1884 there were 78 such insti- 
tutes, with an enzolment of 6,956." With such instruction given in a continuously 
graded course and with great care in the allowance of certificates, it is natural to 
look for good teaching and good schools, ir 28 +

  MISSOURI. 
This State, with some improvements in its school law, presents, too, some in its sta- 
tistics, especially in supplying the average attendance in its schools as well as the 
whole attendance. The statistics for 188283 show an advance over the preceding 
year of 22,584 in school youth and of 18,580 in enrolment, with an absolute number of 
330,411 in average attendance, net comparable with that year because not then given ; 
while schools increased by 276; buildings for them, by 199; sittings in these, by 
24,706; valuation of school property, by $1,767,715, and expenditure fer schools, by 
$13,825. The next year, with a much smaller increase of school youth, there were 
these others: 16,123 in enrolment, 67,620 in average attendance, 311 in schools, 33,725 
in sittings, and $521 ,086 in expenditure for all school purposes, valuation of school 
property and time of school diminishing. The available school fund has come to 
be apparently the largest in the Union, $10,178,806. 
KENTUCKY, 
From the slowness of returns to the State superintendent for the year 1883-84, he 
has been unable to present, in time for this report, even the main statistics for that 
year of the Kentueky common schools. In 1882-83, with a school population of 581,322 
of which one-seventh was colored, this State enrolled nearly 51 per cent. of the white 
youth and over 36 per cent. of the colored, and had nearly 32 per cent. of the former 
and 25 per cent. of the latter in average attendance. With the exception of teachers’ 
pay, advance seems to have been general. 
TENNESSEE, 
Evidences of recuperation from the educational depression of 1882 are manifest in 
every direction. In 1882~83, with only 12,290 more youth of school age reported, 
there was an increase of 62,875 in public school enrolment; while pupils in both public 
and private schools, that had fallen from 318,522 in 1880~’81 to 290,504 in 1881~82, rose 
in number 68,630 at one rebound, and 24,752 still beyond this in the following year. 
The united average attendance in State and private schools, which had been unre- 
ported in 188182, but was restored the next year, reached in the year of its reappear- 
anee a total of 196,380, and the next year went 26,488 higher still, And so it is 
throughout, no decline appearing, except in private schools, outside of the State sys- 
tem, and in consolidated schools, which are only slightly connected with it. 
WEST VIRGINIA, 
In this vigorous young State an elaborate report, which bristles with statistics, 
shows a steady growth in all the elements of a good school system, youth of school 
age increasing by 4,919 in 1882~’83 and by 6,668 in 18838~84; enrolment in the State 
schools, by 5,360 and 5,368; average attendance in them by 1,538 and 3,822; nearly 73 
per cent. of the youth of school age being gathered into the schools, and nearly 45 per 
cent, of them being held there under instruction in both years. Schools, too, in the 
latter year increased by 138; school-houses, by 152; teachers from normal schools 
or with large experience in their work, by 184; expenditure for public schools, by 
$50,060; available school fund, by $4,854; valuation of school property, by $29,574. 
NORTHERN CENTRAL STATES—ONIO. 
Ohio reported in 1883-’84 over 1,082,000 youth of legal school age (6-21) and 
762,755, or 70 per cent., enrolled in public schools, of whom about 499,000 were in 
average attendance, this last figure including about 46 per cent. of the school pop- 
ulation. These figures show anincrease for the year of more than7,000in the number 
enrolled in publie schools and of over 10,000 in that of average daily attendance, 
while the number of pupils in private schools fell off from 31,470 to 10,957. Public 
schools were taught 184 days, at a cost of $9,684,369, in 12,509 buildings, valued, with 
sites and other property, at $22,586,046, an ‘increase for the year in length of school 
term, pumber of sehool-houses, number of teachers permanently employed, and in the

amount expended for all school purposes. Excellent work had been done in the high 
schools and in all the lower ones that were undercompetent supervision. The country 
schools had suffered from a lack of such supervision, a result of lack of harmony 
between local boards of directors and township boards of education. 
INDIANA. 
Indiana reports over 501,000 youth enrolled in public schools in 1883~84 and oyer 
325,000 in average daily attendance, with about 722,851 youth of legal school age (6- 
21), or 69 per cent. of the school population enrolled and 45 per cent. in average at- 
tendance; schools taught 126 days; more than $4,500,000 expended on them, and 
public school property valued at more than $13,500,000. The figures show an increase 
in nearly all the items which indicate effective school work. Although only 473 
more youth were enrolled in public schools, 9,525 more were in average daily attend- 
ance, more schools were taught, more houses built, and the value of school property 
increased, although the average school term was 4 days shorter and the whole ex- 
penditure for schools a little less. 
  ILLINOIS. 
This State, with over 1,069,000 youth of legal school age (6-21), reported in 1883~84 
an enrolment of 728,681 in public schools and 485,625 in average daily attendance, or 
about 68 per cent. of the school population enrolled and nearly 46 per cent. in aver- 
age attendance. There were also 75,821 attending private or church schools, which, 
added to the number in public schools, woul! give 75 per cent. of the school population 
under instruction during some portion of the year. Nearly 12,000 public schools were 
taught, the average term for the State being 151 days, and $9,628,186 were expended 
onthem, The statistics, as for years past, continue to show an increase indicating 
advance in nearly all the items reported. The increase in average daily attendance 
(26,469) was considerably greater than that in youth of school age and was more than 
twice as great as the increase in enrolment. More schools were taught and more of 
high school grade, more school-houses were reported, the valuation of public school 
property increased by $992,640, and over half a million of dollars more were expended 
on the schools than the year previous. 
MICHIGAN. 
Of about 577,000 youth within the legal school age (5-20) over 400,000, or 70 per 
cent.; were enrolled in public schools, besides 27,130 in private schools. Public schools 
were taught fora ternvof 152 days, at a cost of over $4,636,000, in school-houses valued, 
with other school property, at nearly $11,000,000. The figures show an increase for the 
year of more than 13,000 in the number of pupils attending public schools and of 
about 4,500 in the attendance on private schools, of 4 days in the average public 
school term throughout the State, of about $509,000 in the valuation of public school 
property, and of $376,462 in the amount expended on public schools. There was also 
aslight advance in the pay of teachers, the average monthly salary of men being $1.93 
more and that of women $1.10 more. 
WISCONSIN. 
With 528,750 youth of legal school age (4-20) in 188384, nearly 317,000, or about 
60 per cent., were enrolled in public schools, an increase for the year of over 7,000 in 
enrolment and 18,625 in school population. Thercported attendance on private schoo}s 
(15,616) decreased considerably during the year, but these statistics were incomplete, 
many large cities having failed to report on this point. About 8 per cent. of all the 
children between 7 and 15 years of age attended public schools, an increase for the 
year of 3,466 and for 2 years of 14,691; and the superintendent thinks that fuller sta- 
tistics on this point would show that nearly all of that age attended during some por- 
tion of the year. An increase is reported in the number of school-houses built during 
the year; in the whole amount expended on public schools; in the number of towns 
which had adopted the township system; in that of districts supplied with libraries, 
dictionaries, maps and globes, and in the number of country districts which have 
adopted a graded course of study.

MINNESOTA. 
This State, with 359,366 youth 5 to 21 years of age in 1883~84, enrolled 223,209 in 
public schools, or 62 per cent., of whom 100,637, or 28 per cent., were in average daily 
attendance. The schools were taught an average of 112 days throughout the State, 
at a cost of $2,819,711, in 4,671 school buildings, of which 391 were new, valued, with 
sites and other school property, at $5,415,599. These figures show an increase for the 
year of about 13,700 in enrolment and 8,500 in average attendance, against one of 
22,000 in youth of school age. There was also an increase in the number of teachers 
employed, in the number who had taught three years or more, and in that of normal 
school graduates, in the average pay of both men and women, as well as in the whole 
expenditures for all school purposes and the valuation of school property. 
rowa. 
This State reported over 621,000 youth of school age (5-21) in 1883~84, with about 
469,500 enrolled in public schools and 300,000 in average daily attendance, or over 
75 per cent. of the school population enrolled and 48 per cent. in average attond- 
ance; schools taught an average of 140 days in 13,624 buildings, valued, with other 
school property, at over $10,430,000, and about $5,856,v00 expended during tho year 
for public school purposes. These figures show an increase of 62,590 in the number 
enrolled and one of 46,312 in average attendance, with only 16,483 more youth of 
school age, an advance of 8 per cent. in the proportion of school population enrolled 
and of 6 per cent. in the proportion of school population in average attendance. 
There were 2,352 more schools taught, at an increased expense of $297,809. The 
average term for the State was the same as for the previous year. 
NEBRASKA. 
With 209,436 youth of legal school age (5-21), this State reports 137,618, or nearly 
66 per cent., enrolled in public schools and 81,430, or nearly 39 per cent., in average 
daily attendance, an increase during the year of 11,489 in enrolment and of 10,238 in 
average attendance, with 24,379 more youth of school age. More school districts 
were reported and more in which schools were sustained six months, the average 
term for the State; more school-houses were built; the valuation of school property 
increased, as did the number of teachers employed, their average pay, the whole 
amount expended for pnblic schools, and that of the school funds, permanent and 
temporary. There has been an increased public interest in school work aroused by 
educational meetings and by the efforts of the newspaper press, a better preparation 
of teachers is reported, and progress was made in the direc:ion of grading the course 
of study in country schovls. 
COLORADO. 
This State reported, in 1883~84, 56,242 youth of legal school age (6-21) and 37,872 
enrolled in public schools, of whom 23,307 were in average daily attendance, or 67 
pez cent, of the school population enrolled and 41 per cent. in average attendance; 
graded schools taught 174 days; ungraded, 100; school-houses numbering 525 and 
valued, with other school property, at about $125,000; and $809,898 expended for all 
school purposes, An advance for the year is indicated by the figures in nearly all re- 
spects except as to percentages of the school population enrolled and in average attend- 
ance, these decreasing slightly. The actual number enrolled was, however, 1,428 
greater and the average attendance 299 greater; 52 more school districts were re- 
ported; also 66 more school-houses, with 5,228 more sittings ; and the expenditure for 
school purposes was $57,737 more, 
STATES ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE—NEVADA. 
The decline of mining interests in this State and the comparatively slow growth of 
other industries have evidently told on the population and the schools. Children of 
school age are either less numerous in the years under review than in the two pre- 
ceding ones or are less fully reported. Enrolment in public schools fell off by 235

in 188283 and by 45 further in 1883-84. Enrolment in private schools also dimin- 
ished in both years. But the per cent. of youth enrolled in the State schools was 
better in the latter than in the former year and so was the per cent. of those in aver- 
age attendance. More districts reported, there were more public schools by 7, 5 of 
them graded, and more men were teaching and at better pay. 
CALIFORNIA. 
Advance is seen here, but not as uniform, nor at so many points, as in some past 
years, 1842-83 presenting increase of 6,516 in school youth, of 6,587 in enrolment in 
the State schools, and of 5,417 in average attendance in such schools; school districts 
increasing, too, by 202; those with good accommodations, by 280, and those with 
sufficient grounds, by 251; while in 1883~84 the increase of school youth rose to 12,826 
and that of average attendance to 12,120, enrolment in State schools to 5,190, average 
belonging to 3,882, and districts with proper accommodations and grounds fell off con- 
siderably. The quality of the teaching, however, as indicated by the number of teach- 
ers holding life diplomas, educational diplomas, and evidences of graduation from 
normal schools, must have improved not a little in many of the higher grades of school 
from the addition of 84 such teachers in 1882~’83 and of 243 in 188384, though holders 
of first grade county certificates were much less numerous. Increase in expenditure 
for schools, in the amount of this paid to teachers, and in valuation of State school 
property all increased fairly. 
OREGON, 
  Growth, quiet, but steady, appears here on the whole, though in the former of the 
two years under review there were interruptions of it, the enrolment that year falling 
off 559 and the average attendance in State schools 750, notwithstanding the fact that 
there was an increase of 3,860 in school youth to draw from. In the latter year it 
was a growth, almost without a break, of 4,791 in school youth, of 5,973 in enrolment 
in State schools, and of 6,751 in all schools, while the number in no school increased 
by 3,963. In graded schools the attendance was 1,820 greater, 9 more graded schools 
being reported in 68 more reporting districts, with 215 more teachers than in 1882~83, 
Valuation of school property was $631,096 higher and the permanent State school 
fund $167,478 greater, the only thing in the public school system showing any sign of 
decline being a small falling off in expenditure for free schools. 
THE TERRITORIES— ALASKA. 
The principal schools in Alaska are still those sustained by the Presbyterian Church 
and situated in the southeastern portion of the Territory. A letter from their super- 
intendent, Rey. Sheldon Jackson, shows that schools continued to be taught in 
1883~84 at Haines, Boyd, Juneau, Fort Wrangell, Jackson, and Sitka, industrial de- 
partments being included in 3, and that the whole attendance reported (that at 
Juneau not given) was from 500 to 600. 
A school at St. Paul’s Island, in the southwestern portion of the Territory, one 
of three sustained by the Alaska Commercial Company, reported 47 pupils enrolled 
during 1882~83. 
The recent establishment of a government for Alaska, with an appropriation of 
$15,000 for industrial schools and $25,000 for other schools, will doubtless give a 
powerful impetus to education in this Territory. 
ARIZONA. 
While the schools, taken as a whole, were not up to the standard desired, a steady 
improvement is reported in their character as well as an increase in their number for 
1882~’83 and 1883~84. With over 9,000 youth of school age, about 4,500 or 48 per cent. 
were enrolled in public schools in 1883-’84 and over 3,000 or 35 per cent. were in aver- 
age daily attendance, an increase for the year of about 8 per cent. of school popula-

tion enrolled and in average attendance. There was an increase, too, in the number 
of schools taught, in the average length of term throughout the Territory, in the 
number of school-houses, value of school property, amount expended on the schools, 
and in the pay of teachers, who were becoming better qualified for their work. 
DAKOTA, 
Under an intelligent and active superintendent schools and school work have greatly 
advanced in this large Territory, the increase in 1882~’83 being 17,661 in school youth, 
8,537 in enrolment, 389 in reporting districts, 385 in public schools, 317 in school- 
houses, and $217,841 in expenditure for schools, The next year shows a further ad- 
vance of 21,023 in youth, of 16,043 in enrolment, of 11,960 in daily attendance from 
the first report of it in 1882-83, of 602 in districts, of 592 in schools, of 785 in school- 
houses, and of $774,554 in school expenditure. This is a splendid record, especially 
as it has been accompanied with a great improvement of the school law, securing a 
township system in at least 50 counties. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
The District public schools in 1882~-’83 increased their enrolment by 1,272 over that 
last reported, for 1880-’81; the average attendance, by 1,561; the seating capacity 
for pupils, by 3,285; the teachers, by 45; the expenditure for school purposes, by 
$142,370, a fair part of this latter going towards improvement in school accommoda- 
tions; notwithstanding which the valuation of school property for the year is put 
lower than in 1880~’81. In 1883-’84 enrolment went 1,817 beyond that of the preced- 
ing year; but average attendance, only 27 beyond; seating capacity, only 48 beyond; 
teachers (believed to be now almost wholly graduates of normal schools), 20 beyond; 
expenditure for schools falling off $109,994, while valuation of school property went 
$90,000 higher. , 
IDAHO. 
The statistics of this Territory for 1882-83 and 1884~’84 are an improvement on 
those of the last report, but are still imperfect. As far as they go, they indicate for 
the former year an increase of 1,286 in school youth, of 15 in school districts, and of 
$19,993 in expenditure for schools, these being the only things in which comparison 
with 1881~’82 is possible. For the latter year (1883~’84) the increase in school youth 
reported was 2,204; in enrolment, 1,863; in school districts, 40; in schools, 41; in 
school-houses, 27; in expenditure for schools, $23,066, many districts in both years 
not reporting. 
INDIAN TERRITORY. 
The matter under this title covers not only the education given to school youth of the 
Five Nations, but all education of Indians in the United States. It shows continuous 
improvement: 3,356 more youth of school age in 1882~83 than in 1881-’82; 5,422 more 
still in 1883~84; enrolment in the former year increasing $31 and in the latter 4,368, 
the per cent. of school youth enrolled being 32.17 in 1882~83, 37.14 in 1883~84; per cent. 
of school age in average attendance, 17.87 in the former year, when there were inter- 
ruptions to education in the Creek Nation; 22.04 in the latter year, when those inter- 
ruptions had ceased. The effects of education were still further shown in a greatly 
larger number of Indians able to read, especially in the Five Nations, and in a total 
of 71,194 Indians in the United States now able to express themselves to some extent 
in English. 
MONTANA. 
A steady improvement is reported here in school affairs in nearly all respects. 
With 15,082 youth of legal school age 8,118 were enrolled in public schools and 4,465 
were in average daily attendance, an increase of 874 in youth of schd6l age and of
-P-A-G-E-52
LIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION 
1,085 in the number enrolled, with 652 fewer in average attendance. This shows 
nearly 84 per cent. of the school age attending school and nearly 30 per cent. in 
average attendance, notwithstanding that the school age in this Territory extends 
from 4 to 21 and that very few attend school under 5 or over 15. The superintendent 
thinks that nearly all the children in the Territory between 5 and 15 were under in- 
struction in public or private schools. An increase was reported in the average 
public school term throughout the Territory, in the number of teachers employed, and 
their average pay; also, in the number of school-houses and the valuation of school 
_ property. 
NEW MEXICO. 
This Territory has no superintendent of public schools; and no information as to 
the condition of educational interests therein has been received for several years 
past. Asa public school system was established by act of the legislature, March 31, 
1884, and school officers were named for putting it in operation, reports may soon be 
expected. 
UTAH. 
Public schools, in a great majority of the districts, were reported in good condition 
and constantly improving. The statistics show 48,889 youth of school age (6-18) in 
1884, of whom 29,325, or nearly 60 per cent., were enrolled in public schools and 
19,073, or 39 per cent., were in average attendance, the schools having been taught 
throughout the Territory an average of 135 days, at a cost of $204,340; an increase 
for the year of nearly 3,000 in school population, of 638 in the number enrolled, and 
of 1,286 in average attendance. More school rooms were used, the average term was 
5 days longer, and the average pay of teachers increased, as did the amount expended 
for schools and the valuation of school property. 
WASIIINGTON TERRITORY. 
A prosperous condition of the schools is reported here for both years under review. 
In 1883~84, with 31,599 youth of school age (6-21), there were 22,341, or over 70 per 
cent., enrolled in public schools and 14,223, or 45 per cent., in average daily attend- 
ance. Schools were taught an average term of 92 days in 652 houses, at a cost of 
$287,590. The figures show an increase for the year of 5,643 enrolled and of 6,255 in 
average daily attendance; 156 more school-houses, 87 built during the year; 341 more 
teachers, and $142,765 more expended for all school purposes. The superintendent 
says that within the past few years there has been a strong and steadily increasing 
demand for a better class of teachers, and that the school buildings are better and 
are largely supplied with improved furniture. 
WwYoMIne. 
From this large Territory no report whatever for either 1882~’83 or 1883-’84 has 
reached the Bureau of Education,

aIn Delaware, in addition to the school tax collected from colored citizens, the legislature appro- 
priates annually $5,000 from the State treasury for educating the colored children of the State; in 
Maryland, there is a biennial appropriation; in tho District of Columbia, one-third of the school 
fands is set apart for colored public schools; in South Carolina, the school moneys are distributed in 
proportion to the average attendance, without regard to race; and, in the other States mentioned 
above, the school moneys are divided in proportion to the school population, without regard to race. b Outside of Wilmington.

@ There should be added the 655 schools in free States, having an enrolment of 54,322, making total 
number of colored public schools 18,258 and total enrolment in them 1,056,635. This makes the total 
number of schools, as far as reported, 18,422, and total number of colored race under instruction in 
them 1,080,441. In free States in which no separate report of colored schools is made, the figures of 
the United States Census of 1880 have been used, 
The education of the colored youth of the South continues to be a matter of grave 
interest. Of the many questions to which its consideration gives rise three may be 
regarded as of chief importance: Are the funds devoted to this purpose sufficient as 
compared with the amounts allowed elsewhere? Is the instruction adequate? Are 
the results more and more encouraging, whether we regard the number brought under 
instruction or the effects of the instruction? With reference to the first inquiry 
information is furnished in the foregoing table of comparative statistics of education 
in the South and in Table I, Part 2, Summary B, of per capita expenditure. It will 
be well to look a little more closely at the effort put forth by the States under con- 
sideration as compared with other States, remembering that, with the exception of 
Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, both races share alike in the dis- 
tribution of the school moneys. What a State really pays for education in any year 
is shown by the amount of the fund distributed and the average attendance of the 
pupils, where this is fully and correctly given. That serious errors and omissions are 
made by local authorities with reference to this estimate, especially where no efficient
-P-A-G-E-60
LX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
supervision exists, is well known. However, upon such showing as we have, I call 
attention to a few comparative statements : 
Florida, with a population! of 269,493, school age being 6 to 21, reports an expendi- 
ture of $4.80 per capita on ayerage attendance; Rhode Island, population being 
276,531, school age 5 to 16, reports $16.89 on average attendance, 
Georgia, with a population of 1,542,180, school age being 6 to 18, reports $3.25 per 
capita on average attendance; Iowa, population being 1,624,615, school age 5 to 21, 
reports $19.50 per capita on average school attendance. 
Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, combined population being 4,454,674, the 
longest school age 6 to 21, report an average of $5.22 per capita on average attendance; 
Pennsylvania, with a population of 4,232,891, school age 6 to 21, reports $12.52 per 
capita on average attendance. 
West Virginia, with a population of 618,457, scheol age being 6 to 21, reports $7.56 
per capita on average attendance; Connecticut, with a population of 622,700, school 
age being 4 to 16, reports $19.64 per capita on average attendance. 
Louisiana, Maryland, and South Carolina, combined population being 2,870,466, 
the longest school age being from 5 to 20, give $10.21 as the per capita on average 
attendance; Illinois, population being 3,077,871, school age 6 to 21, reports $19.99 per 
capita on average attendance. . 
Mississippi, with a population of 1,131,597, school age being 5 to 21, reports $3.65 
per capita on average attendance; New Jersey, population being 1,131,116, school age 
5 to 18, reports $15.14 per capita on average attendance. 
It is unnecessary to pursue these comparisons further, as in every case the advan- 
tage is so clearly on the side of the Northern States. 
In England and Wales, for 1883, the cost of maintenance per child in average at- 
tendance upon public schools was 2l. 1s. 34d., or $10.40; in Scotland, 20. 2s. 13d., or 
$10.25; cost for providing new accommodation not being included. In Malta and 
Gozo, colonies of Great Britain, for the same year, the corresponding expense was 
1l. 58. 24d., or $6.13; in Victoria, 41. Os. 33d., or $19.53; in South Australia, 2l. 168. 73d., 
or $13.77; in New Zealand, 41. 38. 7}d., or $20.34. 
But (to return to our own country) I have not brought into this consideration the 
ability of the States to provide for the education of the youth of school age, as shown 
by their property valuation, This would hardly make the case stronger than the 
general statements which come to us from different quarters. 
Almost without exception, the State and school officers of the Southern States are 
agreed that their States can do no more at present. They admit their increasing 
prosperity; they point, as they may well do, to the rapid increase in their school 
funds, amounting, as our tables show, to something over $2,000,000 since 1882; but 
over against these facts they call to mind the continued depression of all valuationsin 
their midst, the long prostration of business, their want of school accommodations and 
of trained teachers, and, above all, the burden of illiteracy which rests upon them, 
and they declare that this illiteracy cannot be overcome by means of the State and 
local funds as rapidly as the interests of the particular States involved aid of the 
entire nation demand. We have even more impartial testimony upon this point. 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry says in his latest report to the trustees of the Peabody fund: 
The States which comprise the field of the operations of the fund gradually increase 
in their material resources. With advancing prosperity come corresponding ability 
and inclination to foster general education. With increased taxable property school 
revenues increase, $    
But, while this admission was fully confirmed by the knowledge of the trustees 
themselves, the facts as known both to them and to their agent were still such as to 
lead them to renew their appeal to Congress for Federal aid. : 
Whether the instruction given in the colored schools meets the requirements de-

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. LXI 
pends largely upon the money appropriated, inasmuch as the amount determines tho 
length of the school year and in a measure the quality of the teachers. The average 
length of the school year in the most favored States of the Union is from 7 to 9 
months of 20 days each. All reports and personal observation show that this is a 
limit seldom reached in the States under consideration, the funds oftentimes allowing 
no more than 2 or3 months to the school year. As to teachers, those employed in the 
southern cities compare favorably with those in the cities of other sections. In the 
rural districts there is much to depress the service, more, apparently, than in the rest 
of the country. These drawbacks are not, however, more unfavorable to the progress 
of the colored than of the white schools, excepting so far as white teachers have the 
advantage in inherited aptitudes and domestic and social surroundings. Even here it 
must not be forgotten that many of the colored schools have had the service of northern 
teachers, who gave themselves to the work in the true missionary spirit; asa rule they 
were trained teachers, so that their instruction not only has taken hold of the moral 
nature of their pupils, but at the same time has been characterized by excellent 
methods. 
The table indicates what the various religious denominations are still doing in this 
direction. It must, however, be borne in mind that nearly all of the teachers trained 
in the various institutions there presented have been and will be drawn to the cities 
and to schools above the lower grades; hence the rural schools must look to other 
sources for qualified teachers. At the present time their wants, in this respect, are 
only too apparent; but the future prospect is cheering, provided the necessary funds 
for supporting the work begun are forthcoming. The recent policy of the trustees 
of the Peabody fund has done much to create throughout the South a fall apprecia- 
tion of the importance of this matter. The fund is now applied chiefly in two direc- 
tions, namely, to teachers’ institutes and to normal schools. The former are State 
institutes, conducted in a superior manner and intended to furnish a model for local 
institutes ; and it is only as they are supplemented by the latter that the large body 
of rural teachers can be reached. The number of these institutes is increasing and 
there seems to be a growing disposition to provide for them out of local or State funds. 
A high standard of training cannot, however, be maintained without the influence of 
normal schools; so that we look to the condition of these rather than to that of sub- 
ordinate agencies when endeavoring to determine what are the prospects of improve- 
ment in the teaching force of any section. Normal schools, including the Normal 
College at Nashville, Tenn., and the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, re- 
ceived from the Peabody fund for the year ending October 1, 1884, $19,068. Of the 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, no truer words could be spoken than 
those employed by Hon. J. L. M. Curry in his report for 1884: 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, under the administration of its accom- 
plished president, is almost an anomaly in educational work. Its success has been 
extraordinary. The sixteenth annual report shows an enrolment of 654 students of 
the average age of 18 years, representing 10 States and 4 Territories. ‘The record 
of Hampton’s graduates is the test of Hampton’s success.” They largely engage in 
teaching, and do such satisfactory work that the applications for teachers exceed the 
supply. An important change in the course of study is to be tried. Hereafter each 
class will be sent out for one year of teaching or other practical work. It is thought 
that, after a year of real life work, the student will come back with valuable experi- 
ence and anew purpose. Hampton has three industrial departments — the household, 
the agricultural, the mechanical — and the result is ‘‘ proving that industrial training 
tends, on the whole and in the long run, not against, but to favor, mental progress.” 
The view here expressed is abundantly confirmed by my personal knowledge of the 
operations of this institution. The industrial element so successfully developed at 
Hampton has been introduced in a number of the normal schools for colored teachers. 
The various complications that have affected the Nashville Normal College for the 
past few years seem to be happily adjusted. It is now supported by the liberal appro- 
priation from the State treasury of $10,000 per annum and by a contribution of $9,000 
per annum from the Peabody fund. The year has witnessed substantial additions to
-P-A-G-E-62

its resources, the chief being the Ewing Gymnasium and the improvements in Linds- 
ley Hall, ‘‘by means of which,” to quote Eben 8. Stearns, chancellor of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville and president of the Normal College, ‘‘the college will be put in 
possession of one of the largest and best appointed working chemical laboratories in 
the South.” 
At this point I should like to introduce specific statements from the current reports of 
State superintendents showing the efforts that are being made in the Southern States 
to establish normal schools and to equip them for their work, statements which are con- 
firmed by my personal knowledge of the facts; but space forbids that Ishould longer 
dwell upon this subject. s3 
The increase of enrolment and of average attendance in the public schools for col- 
ored children must be regarded as one of the surest evidences of progress. So far as 
this can be exactly shown, it is brought out in the tables of my successive reports 
and in the abstracts of the appendix. Since 1882 it will be seen that the total in- 
crease of enrolment in the colored schools of the Southern States and the District of 
Columbia is 199,331. As a rule, average attendance increases with the increase of 
enrolment. Under this head Hon. G. J. Orr, State school commissioner of Georgia, 
having presented a carefully prepared table showing the enrolment and average 
attendance in the common schools of his State since 1871, says: 
This table shows continuous progress, without any backward movement; a thing 
which, as far as I am informed, has not occurred in any other Southern State. 
South Carolina has been working against peculiar difficulties; nevertheless, prog- 
ress has there been maintained. In Mississippi and Florida the outlook is more hope- 
ful than formerly. In Louisiana the school system has much to contend with, and 
more especially in the city of New Orleans, but prominent citizens have been roused 
to thoughtful concern in the matter and have organized a society to promote public 
education in the city and State. In Kentucky, Superintendent Pickett, after the 
most persistent effort, has succeeded in securing the passage in the legislature of a 
school bill, by a majority of 21 votes, which “increases the school fund more than 
$200,000; gives counties power to levy a local tax for the whole county; abolishes 
the district idea and makes the county the unit; provides for county superintendents 
instead of commissioners; makes trustees finable for failure to provide suitable school- 
houses; makes the school month 20 days ; forbids a change in text books more than 
once in 5 years; and provides for model teachers’ institutes.” In the remaining States 
there is a continuation of the progress reported for several successive years. 
While the condition of school attendance and support is so gratifying, evidences are 
not wanting that work carried on in the past has effected a great improvement in the 
morals, industrial habits, and general intelligence of the colored people. This is more 
and more apparent to me as official duty calls me year after year to renew my per- 
sonal observation of different sections of the South, and my opinion is confirmed by 
the statements of so many eminent men, thoroughly familiar with the field, that I am 
sure it cannot be refuted.

The disbursements from the Peabody fund from 1868 to 1884, inclusive, amount to 
$1,476,579. In 1882 they showed increase over several preceding years, since which 
they have again declined a little. Four States, Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
and Louisiana, received larger appropriations. than in 1883, while Texas shows a 
smaller appropriation than for several years. Properly managed, the magnificent 
school fund of the last named State will eventually render it quite independent of 
any outside aid and, so far as school money goes, will place it among the leading States 
of the Union. 
The stimulating influence of the Peabody fund has extended far beyond the limits 
of the pecuniary aid afforded. The present agent, Hon. J. L. M. Curry, has continued 
the policy of his predecessors in giving his personal inspection and counsel to every 
part of the States aided. He has, moreover, accomplished great and lasting results 
by his eloquent and pointed addresses before the legislatures of most of the States 
participating in the fund. His adaptation to efforts of this kind is so marked that

the citizens of Kentucky urged him to come into their midst and assist in creating a 
popular sentiment in favor of ample provision for the support of public schools. - 
By invitation of the general assembly of that State he addressed that body on the 
subject, and thereby materially contributed to the passage of the school bill previ- 
ously mentioned in these pages.

The John F. Slater fund, as stated in my last report, consists of $1,000,000, con- 
veyed in 1882 by Mr. Slater to several gentlemen in trust for the education of the 
freedmen of the South. The general agent, Dr. A. G. Haywood, spent nearly a year 
in personal examination of the conditions bearing upon this particular branch of edu- 
cational work in the South and presented to the trustees a detailed report based upon 
the same. After this report had been fully considered the following resolution was 
adopted as to the plan of operations: 
Resolved, That for the present this board confine its aid te such schools as are best 
fitted to prepare young colored men and women to become useful to their race ; and 
that institutions which give instruction in trades and other manual occupations that 
will enable colored youths to make a living and to become useful citizens be carefully 
sought out and preferred in appropriations from this fand; and that, so far as practi- 
eaules the scholars receiving aid from this foundation shall be trained to some manual 
occupation simultaneously with their mental and moral instruction; and that, to ini- 
tiate the policy set forth in this resolution, the sum of $20,000 be appropriated and 
spent under the direction of the general agent during the year 1883. 
The distribution of the fund, as reported in the table, has been made in accordance 
with this plan, which greatly extends the industrial training of the colored youth of 
the South. Out of twenty-three institutions aided, nineteen applied the whole or a 
portion of the amount received by them to establishing or improving industria. 
departments. 
Additional resolutions adopted by the trustees at their meeting of October 16, 1883, 
allowed the general agent to devote a sum not to exceed $1,000 in aiding suitable 
young men to prepare themselves for the practice of medicine among their people, 
and another thousand for the benefit of students showing exceptional gifts and prom- 
ise of usefulness. Shaw University, Raleigh, N. C., and Meharry Medical College,

JOHN F, SLATER FUND. LXV 
Nashville, Tenn., received the benefits of the former. For the ensuing year a sum 
not to exceed $4,000 is allowed for these special purposes. The importance of aiding 
in the work of medical instruction cannot be overestimated. As shown by our tables, 
only three schools of medicine are available for the training of colored doctors in the 
Southern States, and no one of these has in full the resources which the work requires. 
Through the wise counsels of the trustees and the large knowledge, energy, and 
experience of the general agent, the Slater fund promises inestimable benefits to the 
colored people.

LXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
  Table II presents the school statistics of 266 cities, whose total population, according 
tothe census of 1880, was 10,790,034, or a little more than one-fifth of the total popula- 
tion of the United States. 
The tax for school purposes on assessed valuation ranges from .95 of a mill to 25 mills 
per dollar of assessed valuation. 1t is 10 mills or more in 31 cities and 4 mills or less in 
81. The total receipts for 1883, 10 cities not reporting, were $32,461,172. The total ex- 
penditures for the year, 11 cities not reporting, were $30,008,015. The totals are apt to 
be misleading unless particular attenticn is paid to the details of the table; for example, 
36 of the cities do not report school population, so that the total under that bead (viz, 
2,894,836) is for 230 citiesonly. Nineteen of the 36 cities that fail to reportschool pop- 
ulation do not report school enrolment; in addition, 49 cities that report school popu- 
lation do not report enrolment in schools; so that the total school enrolment, viz, 
1,857,435, is for 198 cities, of which number 181 report this item and also school popu- 
lation. The average daily attendance, viz, 1,218,655, is for 245 cities. Fromanexam- 
ination of the statistics of 213 cities that report both school population and average 
daily attendance, it appears that the average daily attendance (1,066,357) is very 
nearly 40 per cent. of the corresponding school population (2,797,818). But this popu- 
lation, it must be remembered, greatly exceeds the number of youth whose attendance 
might reasonably beexpected. The legal school period in the cities tabulated ranges 
from 10 to 17 years, whereas from 6 to8 years isinall countries the recognized duration 
of theschool period. Philadelphia, the cities of Massachusetts, three cities of Rhode 
Island, and a few cities of New Hampshire report the shortest period, i. e., 10 years. 
The actual co: dition of school attendance in the United States may be more fairly 
illustrated by the statistics of these cities than by the statistics of all the cities. 
Twenty-four cities of Massachusetts, having a school population of 179,121, report 
enrolment in public schools as 176,781, or 98 per cent., and average daily attendance 
as 128,847. If the estimated enrolment in private schools (23,685) be added, we have 
a total enrolment exceeding the legal school population. Three cities of Rhode Island, 
having a school population of 9,257, enroll 6,678, or 72 per cent., and have an average 
daily attendance of 4,040. The estimated enrolment in private schools brings the en- 
tire school enrolment up to 87 percent. of the school population. Philadelphia, with 
aschool population of 250,000, reports an average enrolment of 105,424, or 42 per cent., 
and an average attendance of 99,364. If the estimated enrolment in private schools, 
viz, 18,000, be added, the entire enrolment reaches very nearly 50 per cent. of the 
school population. In the cities specified, the ratios of average daily attendance to 
enrolment are as follows: Twenty-four cities of Massachusetts, 98 per cent.; three 
cities of Rhode Island, 60 per cent.; Philadelphia, 42 percent. One of the most grat- 
ifying evidences of the progress that the free school system is making in southern 
cities is found in the increasing rates of school attendance: for instance, in Richmond 
an averago attendance is reported of 93.9 per cent. in the white schools and 97.8 per 
cent. in the colored schools, 
Upon a careful examination of the conditions of school attendance in cities, both 
of our own and other countries, it appears evident that an average attendance at 
schools, public and private, of not less than 90 per cent. of the youth included in 
the ordinary ages of school attendance should be maintained. How far this is ac- 
complished in any particular city cannot be exactly shown without the census of the 
youth of those ages, with the attendance at all classes of schools. The data that 
we have, however, show very clearly the need of better results in this particular. 
It need hardly be suggested that a deficiency of school accommodation, such as un- 
fortunately exists in many of our cities, effectually prevents the desired attendance. 
In a number of cities there is a disposition so to limit appropriations that the build- 
ing and furnishing of school-houses cannot possibly keep pace with the requirements 
of a rapidly growing population. The tendencies of a such course are illustrated 
in the condition of things in Milwaukee, where since 1882 the liberal policy which  
-P-A-G-E-85
  CITY SCHOOLS. LXXXV 
previously characterized the citizens and the common council has been interrupted 
by acts of the legislature. Hon. Joshua Stark, president of the school board, says: 
It is to be regretted that the measures adopted to restrict taxation could not have 
been so framed as to allow a reasonable outlay to meet the increasing educational 
wants of the city. I do not doubt that the school census to be taken this month will 
show an increase in the number of children between the ages of 4 and 15 of more than 
5,000 within the past three years. That number will have swelled to fully 7,000 by the 
Ist of January, 1885, But little addition has been made to our school room during the 
past three years. It is probable, therefore, that before means can be secured for the 
erection of more school buildings we snall have many thousand children in the city 
who ought to be in the public schools but must be excluded for want of room. It is 
to be hoped that some way may be devised to lessen this great evil and positive mis- 
fortune to the city. 
In the southern cities, in which the increase of school population by immigration is 
small, the deficiency of school places, so generally complained of, is due to the recent 
date of the free school system, the low state of school finances, and the necessity of a 
donble system of schools to accommodate white and colored children respectively. 
Whatever be the cause of the deficiency, it is an evil that should be distinctly set 
before the taxpayers and promptly overcome. 
Half day sessions in the primary grades are very generally adopted as a means of 
meeting the pressure for school places, This seems to work very well, so far as the 
children are concerned, but care must be taken not to impose too great a strain upon 
the teachers. Asa rule, the teacher must change with the class; occasionally one 
teacher is found who is able to do double work. When this is the case, the salary 
should be proportionally increased. 
A general conviction of the importance of elementary education will go far to in- 
sure a full use of the school provision, but experience shows that this is not under 
all circumstances the only force required for bringing about the desired result. 
In crowded cities, where business competition is keen and the necessities of life not 
easily secured, compulsory school laws have been deemed necessary to counteract the 
greed of parents and employers and to bring to light the disabilities from which par- 
ents must be relieved before it is possible for them to allow their children the benefit 
of school privileges. 
Tn my last annual report the status of each State and Territory with reference to 
compulsion was set forth. But compulsory laws enacted by State legislatures may 
fail of effect in individual cities tirough the indifference or opposition of the municipal 
authorities. Where local school officers are not in agreement with the State authori- 
ties on this subject it would seem that the opinion of the former ought to determine 
the local action, since, presumably, they understand the situation better than any 
other class of persons. 
Hon. Daniel Leach, superintendent of schools, Providence, R. I., calls attention to 
the failure of the city council to pass an ordinance to carry into effect the truant law 
enacted by the last general assembly. He says: 
While there may be serious objections to rigidly enforcing the whole law as it 
now stands, there are some sections of it that ought, unquestionably, to be put in 
force at once. It is an undoubted fact that there are a very large number of the 
youth of this city of proper school age without any regular employment, now grow- 
ing up in ignorance, roaming our streets, and becoming initiated in the worst of evils. 
Can any one with proper sentiments of humanity, and who tasany regard to the future 
of our city, doubt that this increasing evil ought without further delay to be reme- 
died? There are, besides, hundreds of our youth who enter school, but who are in 
the habit of rnnning away and enticing others to join them. Many of this class can- 
not be controlled by their parents, who often beg for some assistance to enable them 
to keep their children in schoo]. The number of truants the past term is,very much 
larger than ever before. None but teachers can be fully aware how much our schools 
are suffering from this cause. Ought not something to be done, and that speedily ? 
But in regard to children who are regularly employed under the age of twelve 
or fourteen years, and when the necessity of parents absolutely requires for their 
comfortable support the profits of their labor, there are serious difficulties in rigidly 
enforcing thelaw. * * * There are in this city quite a number of families that

would be obliged to go to the Dexter Asylum were it not for the pecuniary aid of 
their young children. <A judicious arrangement, however, that shall be humane and 
that will be mutually satisfactory to all, can be made by employers and parents under 
the advice and sanction of the school authorities. 
Ought not the wisest legislation that humanity could dictate and a prudent fore- 
sight suggest receive the most earnest and careful consideration? Indifference or 
apathy in regard to this momentous subject should no longer prevail. Let those who 
have doubts of its importance visit our schools and consult the police records. 
-The cities in which an efficient truant service has been established report, I believe, 
without exception, excellent results from the system. Hon. John Jasper, superin- 
tendent of schools, New York City, presents the following among other interesting 
details of the work of the department in that city: 
The total number of visits made during the year was 41,295, classified as follows: 
io stores and factories, 24,498; to homes, 12,013; to schools, 4,784. 
Although, as above seen, 24,498 visits were made to stores and factories in which 
children were known or supposed to be employed, only 243 instances were found in 
which there was a violation of the law. This fact of itself proves the hearty co- 
operation of employers and shows the public sympathy and support in the matter of 
properly instructing the young. 
The number of certificates countersigned by the city superintendent stating the 
child had received fourteen weeks’ instruction during the year was 1,075, an increase 
of 54 over the number granted the previous year. , @ 
In the matter of truancy an improvement is to be noted. Last year 2,495 cases 
were reported, this year 2,069, a decrease of 17 percent. * * * 
During the year the department made a complete and thorough census of all chil- 
dren between the ages of 5 and 14 years residing in the first, second, third, and fourth 
wards. 
‘The returns show that the total number of such children was 5,315, and that of 
this number 4,603 attended school. Of the 712 non-attendants 501 were under 8 years 
of age, and were not, therefore, amenable to the compulsory education act. 
Of the remaining 211 non-attendants 14 were physically disqualified, 7 were kept 
home by poverty, and 36 were legally employed. It will thus be seen that 154 chil- 
dren in the wards just mentioned were absent from school in violation of the law. 
Since the census was made 64 of the 154 non-attendants have been placed in school, 
18 have become 14 years of age, and 43 haye been removed or could not be found, 
There are, therefore, at the present time only 24 non-attendants in the four lower 
wards of the city. Of the 4,603 children who attend school in these wards, 2,962 
attend the public schools, 1,611 the parochial schools, and 30 private schools. 
By such a thorough canvas of the wards of a city as is here reported, the amount of 
irregularity and non-attendance at school caused by extreme poverty, want, or va- 
grancy is readily ascertained. This is a matter that is exciting much attention just 
now in foreign countries, and information is frequently sought as to the measures em- 
ployed in our own cities for bringing the children of the classes indicated under proper 
instruction. 
The attempt has been made in a number of cities to maintain special schools for 
such children, but the more general practice is to gather them, so far as possible, into 
the regular schools and make such allowance for them as their circumstances require, 
Teachers and school officers generally show great interest in the welfare of this class, 
and are indefatigable in their efforts to secure aid for them from charitable organiza- 
tions. In New York the wants of this class are met by the corporate schools. Of the 
operation of these schools Mr. C. Loring Brace, the secretary of the Children’s Aid 
Society, writes as follows: 
There are thousands of children in this city who are left in bitter poverty, often 
without breakfast in the morning, half clad, ignorant, and exposed to every tempta- 
tion. They naturally form our notorious criminal class. On the other hand we have 
a series of board or free schoois with an organization and a standard too strict and 
high for street urchins, which could not, without serious dangers, assume an eleemosy- 
nary character by seeing and clothing the little wanderers of the streets. How have 
wereconciled thetwo? Simply by creating, through voluntary effort, an intermediary 
system: that of the day industrial or corporate schools, These are founded by private 
associations and only receive by act of legislature a part, say one-half, of their sup- 
port from the school tax on ratepayers, proportioned to the sworn average attend- 
ance, The rest of their income comes from private benefaction. They are under the 
rules and regulations of the school board and are examined annually and inspected 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  CITY SCHOOLS. LXXXVII 
occasionally by the officials. But the examinations, owing to the occupation and 
character of the children, are much less strict and less is expected of the pupils than 
in the New York ward schools. The only strictness observi-d is in requiring a correct 
recording of the average attendance, on which the appropriations are based, and in 
preventing all ‘sectarian teaching,” the latter measure being designed to prevent 
the Roman Catholics or any Protestant church from getting control of the free sehools. 
The industrial schools, both day and night, are under private trustees, who appoint 
their own teachers and raise their own funds (except the annual tax appropriation), 
but who conform their course of studies more or less closely to that of the board 
schools. Their object isto gather in the street children, runaways, truants, little 
bootblacks, newsboys, and all the nondescript crowd of half vagrant boys and girs 
who used to infest the New York lanes and alleys. They give them one or more meals 
in the day, clothe them as they earn the clothes or shoes by good marks, cleanse 
them, train them in common school studies and some branch of industry, and then 
after a time forward them on to the ward schools, or to places in families, or at trades, 
or on farms. The children are not overstrained, for they have brain work varied by 
hand work. They do not suffer from headaches, for food is given to the most needy ; 
thé hours are not long; some have simple gymnastic exercise and all get a week or 
two in the countryin summer. Then many of them take necessarily half time sessions 
because they are supporting themselves and their families by street trades. Irregular 
attendance has to be permitted. The day industrial school becomes a kind of Botany 
Bay for all the truants, hard cases, and little vagrants of the ward schools. 
The average annual expense per head, including costof food, clothes, fuel, rent, and 
salaries, is only about $20, reckoned on the average daily attendance. The numbers 
for the year in the schools 6f our own association, the Children’s Aid Society, are about 
10,000 in the aggregate, and those in several other associations will amount to as many 
more; so that some 20,000 children of the poorest classes are thus taught and reclaimed 
each year by this intermediary system of schools forthe poor. No friction or misunder- 
standing between the prvete and public authorities has thus far occurred in this 
matter; but of course this happy result has only been attained by much wisdom and 
good sense on both sides. The industrial schools keep to their own field, the ragged 
and vyerminous and hungry and ignorant children and those in street occupations. 
The board inspectors only demand the essentials to be expected from such a class. 
The private school is a kind of complement of the public school. It does a work the 
other cannot do, and then it prepares for the other. 
‘The Children’s Aid Society, in addition to these industrial schools, has many boys’ 
lodging houses, and in 31 years has placed ont some 70,000 children in homes, 
mainly in the West. 
The result of all these instrumentalities of charity and education is that juvenile 
crime and vagrancy during the past 20 years have been steadily diminishing in 
New York, ie that now we can confidently say that no poor child in New York need 
be homeless in the street, or beg or steal for a living, or want for a meal, if he, will 
work for it, or be without a school, where he can get both industrial and book train- 
ing and plain food, or wait long for a place of work and a home, 
Under ordinary circumstances the most efficient cause of regular and full attendance 
will be found in the excellence of the schools themselves, as is made apparent by 
every general effort for improving the schools. 
INSTRUCTION IN PRIMARY AND GRAMMAR GRADES IN CITY SCHOOLS. 
The grades which enroll the large majority of the pupils, viz, primary and grammar 
or intermediate, never presented so near an equality as at the present time, The im- 
proved methods introduced into these grades, and more especially into the primary 
grades, within the last few years, have been noted in my successive reports. It will 
be interesting to consider exactly what instruction these schools now offer and by 
what tests their work is determined. The statements of attendance, examinations, 
and promotions presented in the current reports of several cities throw much light 
on this subject. 
BOSTON, 
{Report of the superintendent, Hon. E. P. Seaver, for the year ending March, 1884, and of the board of 
supervisors for the year ending September, 1884.] 
From the statistics of school attendance for February, 1884, it appears that the entire 
number of pupils in the schools at that time was 55,578, of whom 24,208, or 43 per 
cent., were in the primary grades. Of the primary pupils 6,563 were in the first 
class. Presumably these figures represent fairly the attendance and distribution of

NEW YORK. 
[Report of the superintendent, Hon. John Jasper, for the year ending December 31, 1883.] 
The total average attendance of pupils for the year in all the schools participating 
in the school fund was 143,177; the average attendance in the primary schools and 
primary departments was 75,548, or 52 per cent.; during the year 16,594 pupils, or 22 
cent. of the average attendance in all the primary grades, were promoted to the 
grammar grades. The law provides that no pupil shall be promoted from any pri- 
mary school unless examined in all the studies prescribed for the first grade of primary 
schools and found qualified by the principal of the department into which the promo- 
tion is to be made. The prescribed studies are the same as those included in the 
examination of the Boston primaries, with the addition of sewing and vocal music. 
BROOKLYN. 
[Report of the superintendent, Hon. Calvin Patterson, for the year ending December 31, 1883.] 
The total number of pupils enrolled in the public schools of Brooklyn December 31, 
1883, was 65,872, of whom 45,524, or 69 per cent., were in the primary grades. Of the 
primary pupils, 5,066 were enrolled in the first class. The number of pupils promoted 
from this class to the grammar grade was 6,168, or 135.6 per cent. of the average at- 
tendance. To understand this ratio it is necessary to keep in mind that the promo- 
tions were made semiannually, and therefore, assuming the average attendance for a 
term to be at least equal to the registry at the close of the term, the number pro-

moted during the year from any grade to the next higher grade would be 200 per cent, 
of the average attendance, provided the entire class were promoted at the endof each 
term. One-half of the given per cent. (in this case 135.6) indicates what proportion 
of the pupils in the corresponding grade were promoted at the end of each term (in 
this case 67.8).

  PHILADELPHIA. 
[Report of the superintendent, Hon. James MacAlister, for 1883~’84.] 
About 50 per cent. of the pupils enrolled in the public schools of Philadelphia are 
in the primary grades; promotions are made from the first primary grade to the sec- 
ondary grades semiannually upon the results of examinations. 
In February, 1884, out of a total of 53,428 pupils in the four primary grades, 9,689 
were in the highest grade. Of these, 9,098 were presented for examination, 7,631 
obtained the promotion average, and 7,195 were sent to the higher grade. 
In June the enrolment in the primary grades was 49,299, of which number 9,424 
were in the highest grade. Of these, 8,793 were presented for examination, 7,114 
obtained the promotion average, and 7,073 were sent to the higher grade. The pro- 
motions were about 75 per cent. of the enrolment. The subjects included in the 
examinations are not stated, but the studies of the grade are the same as in Boston. 
The average age of pupils in the highest primary grade was 9 years 5 months. 
BALTIMORE. 
[Report of Hon. Henry A. Wise, superintendent of schools, for 1883.] 
The total number of pupils enrolled in the public schools of Baltimore, November, 
1883, was 37,546, of whom 22,869, or 60 per cent., were in the primary grades. At the 
examination for promotion to grammar schools in January, 1883, out of 2,475 pupils 
on tbe rolls of the schools examined, 1,481 were examined, 1,394 passed, and 1,406, or 
52 per cent. of the number enrolled, were promoted. At the corresponding examina- 
tions in June there were on the rolls 2,327 pupils: examined, 1,529; passed, 1,362; 
promoted, 1,402, or 60 per cent. of the number on the rolls, 
The studies'of the grade are the same as in the preceding cities, with the addition 
of geography. RICHMOND, VA. 
[Report of Hon. E. M. Garnett, superintendent of schools, for 1882-’83.] 
In Richmond two official examinations are held for promotion during the school 
year. In the first primary grade, from which promotions are made to the grammar 
grades, the examinations are written, and pupils must obtain an average of 75 per 
cent. and have the approval of the principal to insure promotion. Details of the 
examinations are not given, but it is stated that at the final examination the general 
average was, in the white schools, for 6 first primaries, Section A, 86.8, and for 6, Sec- 
tion B, 82.2; and in the colored schools, for 4 first primaries, Section A, 86 per cent., 
and 4, Section B, 81.8 per cent. The subjects embraced in the examination were 
Yeading, spelling, phonetics, arithmetic, mental and written, geography, object les- 
sols, composition and dictation, and penmanship.

CHICAGO. 
[Report of Hon. George Howland, superintendent of schools, for 1883.] 
In Chicago about 76 per cent. of the pupils in the public schools are in the primary 
grades. In 1883 the average daily membership for all the primaries was 43,045.4 and 
for the fourth or highest grade 6,555.6. ‘The number promoted from this grade to the 
grammar grade was 5,244, or 80 per cent. of the average daily membership. 
The studies of the fourth primary are language, arithmetic, geography, music, 
drawing, and miscellaneous exercises, : 
CINCINNATI. 
[Report of Hon. John B, Peaslee, superintendent of schools, for 1883.] 
The public schools of Cincinnati are classified as district, intermediate, and high. 
The district schools are divided into five grades, corresponding to the first five years 
of school. The average number of pupils belonging to all the schools was 27,869, of 
whom 22,201, or 79 per cent., were in the district schools. 
The total number advanced from the highest grade of the district schools as a re- 
sult of the examinations held in June, 1883, was 2,538. The subjects embraced in the 
examination were grammar, arithmetic (mental and written), geography, and spelling. 
The average age of pupils in this grade was, for white schools, 11.4 years; for col- 
ored schools, 12.8 years. 
For several successive years the school statistics of the eight cities mentioned above 
show but little variation in the proportion of primary scholars. The examinations 
haye not been made the sole basis of promotion; probably, on the whole, the daily 
record and the teacher’s judgment have weighed as much; but the examinations do 
undoubtedly afford an excellent index of the general conduct of the work in this 
grade. Ifthe average of passes be lower than may reasonably be expected, then cer- 
tain conclusions are unayoidable: too much is attempted in the grade, the methods 
of instruction are bad, or the examination is not rightly ordered. 
It is not easy to generalize from these statements, on account of differences in the 
particulars noted and in the mode of treating the same. Presumably the reports from 
the eight cities present a fair average of the condition of city primaries throughout 
the country. 
It will be seen that the enrolment in the primary schools is half, or more than half, 
the total enrolment in the public schools of these cities, Boston excepted. In the last 
named it is but 43 per cent, The ages of the pupils and the course of study are about 
thesame in all the cities. The ratio of promotions varies considerably. 
Just here arise the most important of several questions suggested by the state- 
ments: Are the pupils advanced as their interests and abilities demand? Are the 
standards required for promotion too high or too rigid? Do the courses and methods 
of instruction employed accomplish the best possible results for the children whose 
school life is passed chiefly in the primary grades ? 
The ratios of promotions, it will be noticed, range from 50 to 80 per cent. Naturally 
some interest is excited with reference to those who fail of promotion, Do they drift 
away from the schools altogether? Do they return to a fruitless repetition of tasks 
from which they can derive no further benefit? 
It is in respect to considerations like these that system, an orderly, fixed method of 
procedure, may be found to conflict with intellectual and moral development, which 
must forever elude exact measurement, Herein is the need of an intelligent super- 
visory head to administer the system so that it shall subserye without obstructing the 
purposes of education. How true this is has been shown in a striking manner by the 
experience of the only one of our leading cities in which the need of a responsible 
supervising officer had long been ignored. The service was not organized in Phila- 
delphia until the fall of 1883, when Hon. James MacAlister, superintendent of schools, 
Milwaukee, was invited to accept the corresponding office in the eastern city.

  CITY SCHOOLS. XCI 
Among many matters that he found in a confused or chaotic state was that under 
present consideration, viz, the modes and standards of promotion from primary schools. 
The following are the causes he enumerates as retarding promotions from the primary 
grades: (1) The lack of accommodation ; (2) the disproportion between the number 
of secondary and primary schools; (3) the largeness of the lower classes, especially of 
the first grade, in most of the schools; (4) the standards required in the examination 
of the pupils. Under the last, he says: 
The difficulty chiefly arises from the want of any fixed standard in many of the sec- tions. In some sections there is a uniform and permanent percentage for promotion; 
in others, however, it varies in different schools and from term to term, Any one can 
see how injurious a shifting standard of promotion must be to the real interests of the 
pupils, Jn many cases, also, the required percentage is too high and it is applied too rigidly. In one school, with a standard of 90 per cent., but 18 pupils were promoted 
out of 75, and in another, with the same requirement, 4 pupils, whose standing varied. 
from 89.1 to 89.9, were refused promotion to the secondary school. Ninety per cent. 
is an unreasonable average to require of children of 8 or 9 yearsof age. In the gram- 
mar schools no average higher than 70 is required to pass from grade to grade, and 
but 65 per cent, is exacted for promotion to the high school. Indeed, only 60 was 
required till the present year. This order should be inverted, and the standard should 
be made to grow smaller as we proceed from the top to the bottom of the system. 
Seventy per cent, should be the maximum required of pupils in the primary schools, 
and that, too, with an examination adapted to their mental development and the kin 
of instruction appropriate to their tender years, be 
There can be no doubt that the examinations, as now conducted in some sections, 
are a positive hindrance to the progress of the pupils, The high standards necossi- 
tate the formation of small classes which are especially trained for the examinations, 
to the neglect of the other pupils; and, what is even worse, thousands of children who 
cannot pass the tests applied are compelled to go over the same work again and lose 
half a year of their school life. We should not be surprised if dislike for the school is 
the result, and to many children it may amount to a deprivation that will tell upon 
the v hole of their future life, 
HIGHER GRADES. 
The majority of the scholars who enter the grammar or intermediate schools do not 
get beyond the middle of the course. In Boston, where the grammar school comprises 
six classes, 64.4 percent. of the scholars are in the three lowest classes, while only 
6.7 per cent. of the whole are in the highest class. 
In New York, where the grammar schools comprise eight grades, representing about 
four years’ work, 68.68 per cent. are in the four lowest classes, and only 5.50 per cent. 
in the highest class. By comparing the number of pupils in the eighth grammar grade 
in 1879 with the number in the first in 1883, the superintendent is led. to the conclu- 
sion that about 27 per cent. of those that entered the lowest grammar grade became 
pupils of the first or highest. It is unnecessary to multiply figures on this point, as 
the conditions are substantially the same in all cities. 
It is certainly desirable that all pupils should be kept in the schools to the comple- 
tion of the grammar school course, and every effort should be made to accomplish this 
end; but, so long as the majority of the pupils leave at about the middle of the course, 
it becomes necessary to arrange the studies with reference to that fact, This is done 
to a fuller extent than formerly, and, so faras reading, English language, writing, and 
drawing (where it is included) are concerned, the majority of the present courses are 
excellent. In respect to arithmetic, some change seems desirable: as the subject is 
generally treated, scbolars who leave in the middle of the grammar course get little 
or no practice in percentage, and often none in ratio, mensuration, and the extraction 
of roots, all of which are practical subjects. 
A brief course in arithmetic, embracing all the relations of numbers that enter into 
ordinary computations, but limited to simple applications, seems to be required in the 
first two years of the grammar school course; the more difficult combinations to which 
these relations give rise, if considered at all in elementary schools, should certainly be 
deferred to the last two years of the grammar schools, while an elementary course in

inventive or intuitive geometry could be introduced with advantage. The courses 
in geography and history should ulso be so arranged as to accomplish the utmost 
possible for those whose time for study is necessarily short. 
METHODS OF TEACHING READING AND HISTORY. 
READING. 
Methods of instruction, courses of study, and their adaptation to different classes of 
pupils are subjects very fully discussed in the annual reports of city superintendents. 
The practical experience of these officers gives value to their opinions on all matters 
pertaining to the conduct of schools. Space does not permit me to draw as largely 
as I could wish from their discussious and opinions. I present a few extracts con- 
cerning methods of teaching certain branches, 
[Report of Hon. Edwia P. Seaver, superintendent of public instruction, Boston.] 
The method of teaching reading described and recommended by the board of super- 
visors is neither one nor anotlier of the rival methods in controversy, but a combina- 
tion of the valuable features of the several methods. The fundamental process is 
taken from the ‘‘ word method ” and the “sentence method.” It aims to bring about 
associations directly between ideas and the written or printed words; also, between 
thoughts and the written or printed sentences. Thus the true significance of the act 
of reading is impressed on the child’s mind from the very first. The use of objects, 
models, and pictures in preference to the spoken words, for the purpose of establish- 
ing some of the early associations, is a feature taken from the so called ‘ object 
method.” The power of this method may be seen in the instruction of deaf-mutes 
and newly arrived foreign children. The writing feature is taken from the ‘script 
method.” This is important asa means of learning to read and still more important 
as a preparation forcomposition. The letters are learned very early by writing them, 
and spelling follows immediately. The phonic analysis of spoken words (slow pro- 
nunciation) comes in quite early, and phonic analysis of printed words follows after 
the necessary associations have grown up between the elementary sounds and the 
letters representing them. The phonic method, so called, is not made the funda- 
mental process, but it 18, nevertheless, recognized as an indispensable part of a com- 
plete method. Its principal aim is to lead the child to the pronunciation of new 
words by help of the analogies of the language; also, to give valuable practice in 
enunciation. It does not require the aid of phonic type, nor a great array of diacrit- 
ical marks. 
Diacritical marks are believed to be useful only when the pronunciation of a word 
either is against analogy or follows an analogy not yet known to the children. There 
is in some schools a disposition to make an excessive and indiscriminate use of dia- 
critical marks. Words whose pronunciation ought to be perfectly plain from anal- 
ogy, and which the children, unaided by marks, would readily pronounce correctly 
from a subconscious feeling of the analogy, are garnished with superfluous marks, the 
like of which are not all found in the standard authorities. The children, in writing 
their words, are required to copy and learn all these marks, as if they were as essen- 
tially parts of the written words as the letters themselves. That the principal dia- 
critical marks should be learned in school nobody disputes; but that an alphabet of 
a hundred arbitrary signs should be mastered by little children in the first year is a 
proceeding for which there would seem to be no good reason. If the appeal be to ex- 
perience it is only necessary to point to the unsurpassed results obtained by teachers 
who never use marks, save for exceptional words, and then only asa help to pronun- 
ciation, never as an inseparable part of the written word. * * * 
It should be &ept constantly in mind that the main thing in teaching reading is 
not a training of the speech organs to correct utterance of sounds. Important though 
this be, it is still only the physical part of the process. The main thing is a trang 
of the child’s thought-seizing power. This is the intellectual part of the process. 
“Keep your voice up at an interrogation point,” says the teacher who instructs from 
the physical side; but the teacher who proceeds from the intellectual side leads the 
child by some device or suggestion to feel that a question is to be asked, and then tbe 
child’s voice takes care of itself. As a matter of habit the sight of words should sug- 
gest to the child’s mind not merely a series of sounds, but ideas. When the meaning 
is clear its correct expression easily follows. The danger in using the phonic method 
exclusively from the very first is that written or printed words come to suggest only 
sounds to be uttered. Attention being concentrated on this, the thought element 
vanishes and the reading becomes a mechanical process. It would be well, therefore,

not to make the use of diacritical marks too prominent. In the first year’s teaching of. 
reading they ought almost wholly to disappear. The best teachers make but very 
sparivg use of item before the second or third year. 
HISTORY. 
[Report of Hon. John B. Peaslee, superintendent of schools, Cincinnati.] 
Previous to 1872 written percented examinations for transfer were held in history. 
The pupils were required to memorize all the dates, names of persons, and be ab e to 
gre descriptions of all the events recorded within the covers of Anderson’s United. 
tates History, in order to be prepared for the examinations. Five lessons a week 
were given to this stultifying work. The pupils were demerited, coaxed, scolded, 
driven, in order that they might cram their little minds full enough of this dis!aste- 
ful minutia ‘to pass.” It required more time of the children to prepare for recitation 
in history than in any other two subjects in the school course. Many of the teach- 
ers, recognizing the absolute worthlessness and cruelty of compelling the children to 
commit the text book to memory, endeavored to have their pupils answer in their 
own langnage, but it was found impossible to obta n high per cents. in the written 
examination for transfer unless the children committed the text to memory. They 
were too young; they had neither the judgment nor the knowledge and use of Jan- 
guage to do so without memorizing the words of the book. As I said in a former 
report, history cannot be taught successfully by the memoriter plan. No historian, 
as no chemist or botanist, was ever made by committing text books to memory. 
Macaulay, the great English historian, spoke in the strongest terms against memoriz- 
ing lists of dates and dry facts of history. It kills the life out of the subject ; it dis- 
gusts the pupils and gives them a dislike for historical reading. As the pupils take 
no interest in it, it is soon forgotten, and there remains only the bitter recollection of 
tiresome hours devoted to what, if properly taught, brings profit and pleasure. High 
per cents. were considered the sine qua non of the pupils’ success. The teachers were 
judged by them. The principals and others in authority did not realize the tact that, 
under a false method of instruction, the higher the per cents. the poorer the teaching. So the 
cramming process wenton yeargiteryear. Striving for percents. largely took the place 
of judicious teaching. And let me say here that wherever the pupils are submitted 
to a percented written examination in history for transfer to a higher school the sub- 
ject will be taught in the manner and with the results indicated above. There will 
be no reading, no investigaiing outside the text book, so long as the passing of pupils 
depends upon the per cent in history, For years previous to the discarding of the 
old method of teaching history in the intermediate schools, Superintendent Hancock 
saw and deprecated the method pursued, and in 1872 called the attention of the com- 
mittee on course of study to it. Dr. Mayo was chairman of the committee and had 
the good sense to call the principals of the intermediate schools and after thorough 
investigation to decide, on true educational principles, that the method then in vogue 
was radically wrong. The committee, under his leadership, sustained by the opinion 
of the superintendent and two or three of the principals, of whom I had the honor of be- 
ing one, recommended in their report to the board that the number of lessons per week 
be reduced to two, that the written percented examinations be abolished, and that the 
subject be taught according to the plan prepared by the committee. The report was 
adopted by the board and the plan or method, with some modifications, has been pur- 
sued since that time. ‘The principal modifications consist in making biography, which 
is the soul of history, a prominent feature of the work, and in encouraging children to 
read historical and biographical works outside of school and to give sketches of dis- 
tinguished personages and events about which they have read to their classmates. 
As the method of imparting the instruction has been given in former reports, | will 
not dwell upon it here. 
What have been the results of the new method of teaching history? I answer that, 
except in a few cases wherg the teachers have been indifferent or, from lack of abil- 
ity, unable to handle it correctly, the results have been most satisfactory. The pupils 
have been inspired with a love of history. The subject, instead of a burden to them, 
has become a pleasant and delightful study. | Thousands of books of history, of travel, 
of biography, have been read outside of school hours, and a spirit of historical re- 
search has been implanted in thousands of pupils that will remain with them through 
life and that will influence their subsequent reading. What a contrast to the old 
verbatim method! Then (I speak from personal knowledge) no encyclopiedias, gazet- 
teers, or histories other than the text books were brought into the class room. There 
was no time for consulting these, for the bugbear of per cents. was continually staring 
both teachers and pupils in the face. The pupils, instead of being encouraged by 
their teachers, as they are now, to consult reference books and to read good books 
bearing upon history at their homes, were discouraged from it for fear they would 
not get as high per cents. in the examination.

XCIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
Reports of vacation schools for industrial training have been received from Boston 
and Brookline, Mass. The school in Brookline, which was under the control of the 
school committee, offered to boys an elementary course of carpentry and joinery, with 
applications. In Boston, through the munificence of Mrs. Augustus Hemenway, 120 
girls were gathered in the Starr-King Public School-House for instruction in some of 
the industries most desirable for women. These included housework, drawing and 
coloring, embroidery and fine sewing, and, for the older and stronger pupils, cabinet 
making. The classes were in charge of 7 teachers. In connection with the sub- 
ject of industrial training attention should be called to the continued and increasing 
evidence of the excellent results of the provision for teaching sewing in certain 
grades of girls’ public schools. Reports of the work have been received from Boston, 
New York, and Philadelphia. 
So far as reported to this Office the cities in which provision for manual training 
has been made in connection with the public schools, or under the auspices of the 
public school boards, are Boston, New. Haven, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, 
Toledo, Chicago, Moline, and Peru. 
As a result of long continued deliberation, in the light of much practical experi- 
ence, the Boston committee on industrial education submit the following plan for 
organizing manual training as a part of the course of instruction in the public 
schools: 
The shop work adapted to the purposes of general training in the mechanic arts is 
of two kinds: (1) That which is done at a bench with simple hand tools; (2) that 
which requires the aid of machinery and steam power. The first kind is elementary 
in character and preparatory to the second, so that it is convenient to speak of the 
one as elementary and of the other as advanced manual training. 
Advanced instruction in mechanic arts can only be provided for in a central school; 
but elementary instruction can be provided for on a large scale and economically in 
such a way as to give a 2-hour lesson once a week to all the grammar school boys 
who are proper subjects for such instruction. 
Suppose a teacher of carpentry, for example, occupying a conveniently situated 
room, provided with 20 benches, 20 sets of tools, and a quantity of stock, to be 
visited each half day in the week by successive delegations of boys from the 
different grammar schools in the neighborhood. Each delegation would simply be 
excused from attendance at the grammar school on the appointed half day each 
week and attend the carpenters’ class instead. The lesson for each delegation would 
last 2 hours, although boys interested in their work and not neglecting their 
other school work might be allowed to stay another hour. The rest of each day 
would be needed by the carpenter for inspection of the boys’ work, care of the tools, 
and preparation for the next lesson, Working thus he could give instruction to 200 
boys in the course of a week (20 boys each half day for five days). The room, the 
tools, and the teacher’s time would be in constant’ use, so that the greatest economy 
practicable in that regard would be secured. 
As to the number of pupils to be taught at one time, experience seems to have 
shown that 24 is practically a maximum. ‘The number 20 is here chosen because it is 
pretty clear that available school rooms would not accommodate more than 20 at one 
time. 
The capacity of room being, say, 200 boys a week, each neighborhood furnishing 
that number of pupils would have a room and a teacher. 
There are now in our grammar schools about 2,800 boys who are 14 or more years 
old, Assuming that one-half of these boys desire and are otherwise proper subjects 
for the proposed manual training, it would take 7 rooms and 7 teachers to ac- 
commodate them. But, after all, this is only a surmise as to the proportions to 
which the plan may ultimately grow if it should be managed successfully. At first 
only one or two rooms should be opened. Success being secured in these, others could 
be added as need appeared and as competent teachers could be found. 
These elementary manual training schools, as they may be called, need not, of 
course, confine their work to carpentry. There are other kinds of bench and vise 
work which are of an elementary nature, and provision for which would be simple 
and inexpensive. But it would probably be best to begin with carpentry alone, and 
repeat substantially the course of lessons given in the recent Dwight School experi- 
ment.

The advanced instruction in mechanic arts, to be provided for in a central school, 
would require no other facilities than those already possessed by the city, except a 
suitable forging and machine shop. As the boys in such a school would spend three- 
fifths of their time in drawing and in book studies, much as is done in the manual 
training school in St. Louis, they could be well accommodated for that part of the 
time in the rooms of the Latin and English High School building. There are in that 
building, besides some vacant class rooms, four rooms especially designed for the use 
of drawing classes, only one of which is now used. 
In these class and drawing rooms the manual training high school could carry on 
allits work except shop work. Here would be its headquarters. To complete its 
accommodations it would be necessary to build, on some lot of land in the neighbor- 
hood, a forging and machine shop, one story high and lighted from the roof. Such 
a building heed not be expensive. But it is not necessary to go further into the de- 
tails of this part of the plan now, since the question of carrying it out will be decided 
in most minds by the success with which the part relating to the elementary manual 
training may be carried out. 
In conclusion, the committee submit the following orders: ’ 
“Ordered, That the city council be requested to appropriate the sum of $2,500 for 
the equipment and maintenance of a manual training school. 
“ Ordered, That the city council be requested to fit up rooms in the basement of the 
Latin school building, where classes from the grammar schools can be instructed in the 
use of simple hand tools during the ensuing school year.” 
In response to a request from the board of commissioners of public schools, Balti- 
more, the following ordinance was adopted October, 1883: 
Srction 1. Be it enacted and ordained by the mayor and city council of Baltimore, That 
the board of commissioners of public schools of Baltimore City be, and they are 
hereby, authorized and directed to establish in the city of Baltimore, in some con- 
venient locality as near the centre of the city as possible, a school for manual traiti- 
ing under such name or title as said board shall select. . 
Suc, 2. And be it further enacted and ordained, 'That said school shall be open to the 
children of the citizens and bona fide residents of the city of Baltimore, and that the 
admission to said school shall be regulated by the law now existing for the admission 
of pupils to the public schools of the city of Baltimore, except in so far as changed by 
this ordinance. 
Src. 3. And be it further enacted and ordained, That the age and qualifications for ad- 
mission to said school shall be fixed and prescribed by said school board: Provided, 
That the fee for the use of tools and materials for pupils who are the children of resi- 
dents or citizens of Baltimore shall not exceed $1 each per scholastic quarter. 
Sno. 4. And be it further enacted and ordained, That pupils from other places may be 
admitted to said school upon such terms and conditions and upon payment of such 
fees as said board shall prescribe. 
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted and ordained, That this ordinance shall take effect 
from the day of its passage. 
The school commissioners have determined to adopt in this school the same general 
plan that is pursued in the manual training school in St. Louis. 
The subject of manual training as an element of popular education was very fully 
discussed at the meeting of the National Educational Association which was held at 
Madison, Wis., in July, 1884, Several of the papers presented, notably those by Prof. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
XCVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Felix Adler, of the Workingmen’s School of New York City, and Prof. John M. Ordway 
ef the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, not only took the ground that 
manual training should be made a part of general education, but specially advocated 
the introduction of hand work in wood and iron into the public schools. Dr.C.O. 
Thompson, of the Rose Polytechnic Institute, Indiana, was not in favor of making 
hand work in wood and iron a part of public school education, and the general dis- 
cussion called forth by the formal papers indicated a general agreement with his po- 
sition. On the other hand, the need of special schools of mechanic arts, including 
manual training schools, polytechnic schools, art schools, &c., was freely admitted. 
Professor C. M. Woodward, director of the St. Louis Manual Training School, com- 
menting cn the subject as presented before the meeting, gave expression to well timed 
cautions. ‘The air,” he said, ‘‘is full of schemes for the introduction of manual 
training into high schools and the higher grades of grammar schools. The recent 
action of the school boards of Baltimore, Toledo, and Chicago in putting manual 
training into the high schools and the higher grades of grammar schools is likely to 
stimulate still more such measures.” In view of this outlook, Professor Woodward 
hesitates just now to encourage the movement; on the contrary, he warns agaiust in- 
considerate action. ‘‘ My advice is,” he says, ‘‘go slow. Do not mistake the shadow 
for the substance. Treat manual training with dignity and respect.” In expanding 
the last topic he adds: 
  Your shop teacher should be well educated and a natural teacher. Don’t relegate 
manual training to the janitor. In a small school the shop teacher may be also the 
drawing teacher or the teacher of physics. He should be pard as well and rank as 
high as any assistant. Beware of experienced mechanics who are reputed to be fine 
workmen, for they will scarcely appreciate your object and will find it easier to do 
the work themselves than to teach pupils to do it. A bright young teacher who un- 
derstands drawing can, under a good instructor, learn all the woodwork necessary to 
begin with in thirty days of three hours each. If you fail to find a good teacher, 
don’t get any; you can afford to wait; you cannot afford to fail.    
In view of the general demand for industrial training and of the abundant and au- 
thoritative testimony as tothe value of drawing in this relation, it is surprising that 
so large a proportion of our cities still fail to make provision for this branch of in- 
struction. It is to be hoped that the interest manifested in the exhibitions of draw- 
ing at the Madison meeting will lead to a great extension of this training in our pub- 
lie schools, 
RECESS OR NO RECESS. 
The question of recess or no recess, which is exciting much discussion, is one of 
great importance. It bears directly upon the vital matter of the health of the young, 
and in my judgment should be decided with chief reference to that matter. The fol- 
lowing report is the result of a very careful investigation of the subject, and as such 
deserves the attention of all who are directly responsible for the conduct of school life: 
REPORT TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, AT MADISON. 
{Prepared by J. H. Hoose, PH. D., in behalf of the committee on hygiene in cducation.'] 
The practice of dispensing with recess during the daily sessions of school is increas- 
ing. Its advocates claim: (1) It conserves health by preventing exposure. (2) It 
tends to refinement by removing the opportunities for rude and boisterous play. 
(8) It takes away the opportunity for association with the vicious, and consequent 
corruption of morals. (4) It relieves teachers of a disagreeable duty and lightens 
their labors. 
Considering these claims in their order, we observe — 
(1) Exposure to the inclemency of the weather —to rain, snow, wind, severe heat 
or cold—is occasional and less than that which is incurred in going to and from 
school, and even this is, in the economy of nature, often invigorating. On the other 
hand, there is an exposure, constant and always harmful, to the poison of a vitiated 
atmosphere, for ‘the greatest sanitary want everywhere is ventilation ;” to the inac- 
tivity of the yet immature organs of excretion (a danger increased in intensity by the

sedentary habit of the school room, which causes a feverish condition of the abdomi- 
nal and pelvic cavities of the body); to an abnormal growth induced by misman- 
agement during youth, which means disease and intense suffering during adult life. 
It must be remembered that two-thirds of the children of our public schools are yet 
under 12 years of age. Their entrance into school is often without due preparation 
for the confinement of the session. Parents have been neglectful. Teachers must 
supplement this lack of instruction at home in regard to the importance of regular 
attention to the ‘‘ wants of nature.” The recess suggests the duty. Teachers may 
enforce it. 
As is well suggested by a writer in The Popular Science Monthly for November, 
1883, ‘indoor life ‘has already too strong attractions. Out of door exercise should be 
sought with avidity by every child.” Deprivation of sunlight is a serious maiter. 
Involuntary muscles need exercise, and a series of experiments shows that out of 
door exercise quickens the pulsations by 15.4 per minute, while indoor exercise gives 
only an increase of 3 per minute, and quiet sitting will bring them 3.8 below normal. 
The tendency among Americans is to infirmity of those portions of the system that 
are situated in and about the pelvic cavity of the trunk. These are the parts that are 
most intimately concerned in the matter of recess. No mistake should be made here 
in the school management. Pupils should be placed in the way of opportunities so 
that they need not suffer danger because of embarrassments arising from the necessi- 
ties of askirg for opportunities. 
Dr. Bell, in The Sanitarian for December, 1875, uses these effective words: 
“Tf a child of originally healthy constitution be subjected for a sufficient length of 
time to an atmosphere surcharged with carbonic acid ; if it be deprived of light; if 
it be restrained in physical exercise necessary for the development of its organs; if the 
wants of ‘nature’ be neglected; if, above all, the want of supervision, which renders 
these conditions common to school rooms, be extended to a negligence of the virtues 
of children, what else can we expect but a generation of dwarfs, a stunted progeny ?” 
Dr. W. 8. Robertson, president of the State board of health of Iowa, writes in re- 
sponse to my request for an opinion: 
“Our school system is much at fault as regards primary scholars: Too long hours, 
too close confinement, too many studies, imperfect distribution of light, and an al- 
most entire absence of ventilation. * * * Little children should not be kept in 
school more than an hour at a time.” 
No better authority can be cited than Dr. J. S. Jewell, of Chicago, and his entire 
letter is given, for he stands among the first of his profession, especially in his knowl- 
edge of nervous diseases: 
“My Dear Sir: Your courteous note of inquiry in relation to the probable effects on 
the health of pupils by the abolition of recesses and confinement of children for two 
and a half hours at a session has been received. ‘The subject is one to which I have 
given special attention, and upon which I am now preparing matter for publication. 
Ihave no doubt but that the proposed change of abolishing recesses and lengthening 
hours of confinement is one every way to be deprecated from the standpoint of the 
bodily health of the pupils. I am prepared to make this clear to any one, I think. 
But I cannot discuss the subject within the limits of a note sach as you have re- 
quested. .I am sorry the circumstances of the case do not permit me to state the 
grounds of my opinion fully. But my opinion, as expressed, has not been hastily 
adopted, and I have no fear it will be controverted successfully. I am glad to learn 
you are discussing this important subject. 
“Thanking you for your courtesy, 1 beg to subscribe myself, most sincerely yours, 
“J, 8. JEWELL.” 
Dr. W. D. Middleton, professor of physiology in the University of Iowa, writes: 
‘My ideas have changed much since my own children have begun attending the 
public schools, and I find that, however much I am inclined to democracy, I fear the 
schools present it in too large doses for such young stomachs. The recess isan oppor- 
tunity for the dose of democracy, also of fresh air. Of the two evils I guess the de- 
mocracy is the least, so fancy the recess shouldstand. My idea would be something 
like this: Until our school buildings are perfect in the matter of providing pure air, 
two or two and a half hours is too long to expose little children to the noxious sub- 
stances found in breathed-over air, for two reasons, that their demands for oxygen 
are immense compared with the adult standard and their capacities for absorption of 
all noxious substances are correspondingly large.” 
Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley, of Nashville, Tenn., has given this subject much thought, 
and has made an admirable compilation of authorities in a report of 1879 of the Nash- 
ville board of health. 
Commissioner Eaton has twice called up the matter in his excellent reports, for 
1873 and 1875. In neither of these last named reports is the subject of recesses 
especially discussed, but the vital importance of abundant fresh air is forcibly 
presented and the fact cited of universal neglect-of ventilation of school rooms.

xova REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Occasional exposure to inclement weather is far less to be Greaded in the pure air 
than is the constant exposure in poorly ventilated school rooms. 
If doors and windows be thrown open during indoor exercises, exposure 1s greater 
than when children go out of doors properly protected by their wrappings, which they 
| do not think of putting on indoors, and in addition they lose the vivifying effect of 
abundant sunlight and pure air. Even with windows and doors open, the air of the 
school room is not changed while the little laboratories of carbonic acid remain in 
quickened activity within the room. 
(2) What is called rude and boisterous play on the school grounds is only rehears- 
als of the exercises practised, mornings, evenings, and Saturdays, on other grounds, 
with the advantage on the side of the school recesses in the teacher’s supervision. 
Physical exercises demand the conscious expenditure of volitional energy, in that they 
are acts defined by precise limitations; they are never spontaneous activities; they 
are characterized by purpose; this purpose weights down the physical act with 
drafts that tend to exhaust physical and volitional strength. 
Athletics, in which championship is the motive, train the individual to perform suc- 
cessfully his part in an organized contest where the individual is subordinated to the 
organization. These exercises develop only those portions of the physical system that 
are called into exercise by the nature of the game and by the part which the indi- 
vidual has to sustain during its continuance. 
Gymaastics are exercises in squads or groups; their effectiveness depends upon 
numbers; they subordinate the individual to the group; they do not propose the 
harmonious development of the individual so much as the power of the group; these 
two cultivate only special organs and powers. 
Calisthenics propose rythmical movement; they subordinate the individual to the 
clan? they cultivate the body of each without reference to condition or special 
needs. 
Each class of physical exercises has its own characteristic effect upon the mind. 
Athletics develop perseverance, courage, and power to adapt one’s self to emergencies, 
as seen in Greece, Rome, and England. Gymnastics develop endurance, faith in one’s 
own powers, faith in powers of groups, as witnessed in Germany. Calisthenics, as 
practised in Sweden and France, develop taste in the grace of movement, but not the 
sterner and more robust traits of character. America has adopted the three without 
attaining prestige in any. Educators may raise with great force the question whether 
any of bias classes of exercises can be substituted in school rooms for those sponta- 
neous exercises of the school yard. This question becomes more important when we 
reflect that for the school.rcom only one of the three classes named is practicable, 
and that one the least fitted to restore energy of pupils; it isa source of expenditure 
of volitional power and does not cultivate equally with play mental traits and apti- 
tudes of courage, of ready adaptation to emergencies or self reliance. Untilwe have 
some well devised system of exercises under the direction of a physician who prescribes 
the kind and degree of exercise suited to each person, as is in vogue in the Hemenwa; 
Gymnasium at Harvard, also in Lehigh and in Boston Universities, educators may well 
hesitate to substitute the restraints of calisthenics for the freedom and spontaneity 
of life on the playground, ‘ 
(3) Youthful corruption is far more likely to result from personal influence in secret. 
Moral evils spread among pupils by written and printed documents or by conversa- 
tion; both forms of evil covet seclusion. Pupils can spread moral contamination 
with no effect during school hours, when teachers supervise in person the playgrounds; 
but nr two or three ata time to pass from under the eye of their teacher and their 
           
  
  fellows, and needed restraints are removed. It is true that to the playground will 
be traced bursts of passion, differences of opinion, accidents, and the strong influences 
of public opinion of the pupils. All these forces are positive among children; they 
are the primitive, embryonic forms of that society in which adult life moves. A child 
that would become a man in society must be inured by practice and experience to the 
forces into which his adult life will throw him. The patience, forbearance, courtesy, 
and good nature which characterized the immense throng at the Centennial in 1876 
will ever stand as a high tribute to the training which the ehildren in America receive 
in their association in schools and upon the playground. . 
(4) Teachers are not entitled to relief at the expense of their pupils; they are not 
endowed by nature or by law with the sovereign right of eminent domain, the right 
+o appropriate any territory, physical, mental, or moral, at their own good pleasure ; 
they must serve such purposes as society assigns to them. Hase and hardship are not 
weighty points in the problem, when they are set over against the character pf the 
product demanded. If the no recess plan insures as good a product as the recess plan 
does, the teacher is entitled to relief ; otherwise, not. : ; 
For reasons given above, your committee is fully convinced that neither the physi- 
cal nor the moral well being of the child is subserved by the policy of longer and 
continued sessions without an out-door recess,

  NORMAL SCHOOLS. cIx 
Table III presents the statistics of 255 normal schools, having 1,937 instructors and 
60,063 students. Of the whole number, 127 are public normal schools, having 1,147 
instructors and 34,757 students, the number of normal students being 22,710. The 
private normal schools number 128, with 790 instructors and 25,306 students, of whom 
15,644 are normal students. Of the public normal schools, 103 are supported by State, 
2 by county, and 22 by city appropriations. Few cities maintain normal schools and 
the amount of money expended by the cities in this work is small as compared with 
other expenditures for education. 
Like normal] schools in general, the city normal schools fall into two classes: those 
which are strictly professional, as the Boston and Washington normal schools, and 
those which combine academic and professional courses, as the Philadelphia Normal 
Schooland the Normal College, New York City. The age and standard of qualification 
required for admission to the former schools are necessarily higher than are required 
for admission to the latter, the purpose being to secure scholars of sufficient maturity 
and attainments to enable them to profit by the special training. This is an im- 
portant consideration, since training in the theory and art of teaching in the case of 
ignorant, immature pupils is in danger of degenerating into a mere mechanical drill 
upon methods, 
The training of the city normal schools of the first class mentioned is directed. 
chiefly to the preparation of teachers for the primary grades. It is sometimes objected 
that here too much stress is placed upon methods. Such is perhaps the tendency, 
but those familiar with the work going on in the schools of this class that enjoy 
any prestige as training schools are aware that it is a tendency which is watched 
and restrained. The ideal of pedagogic training, it must be remembered, is as yet 
imperfectly formed, but so far as it applies to primary teachers it is without doubt 
in the line of the exercises encouraged in the normal schools referred to. The obser- 
vation of children with the view of finding out their mental and moral attributes and 
the limits of their powers; the knowledge of the results of similar observations by 
others; the consideration of the subjects of elementary instruction; of the relation 
which these bear to the sensible objects and living interests that make up the child’s 
world; of the order and the means by which they may best be presented to the child’s 
attention and excite the voluntary and agreeable action of his mind — these are the 
matters that are urged upon the attentiqn of normal students. The practical results 
of these studies, investigations, and exercises are seen in the improvement that has 
taken place in the past few years in the city primaries. 
The endeavor is being made to secure such a representation of the work of city 
normals at New Orleans as shall indicate, in some measure at least, the methods of in- 
truction that have been wrought out by them. The success of similar representations 
from foreign schools in the Health Exhibition, London, leads to the hope that the 
contemplated exhibition in our own country will bring about a more intelligent and 
more general understanding of what these schools are contributing to the public 
benefit. 2 
State normal schools, established either as separate institutions or as departments 
of universities or colleges, are reported from all the States, save Delaware, Louisiana, 
Nevada, Ohio, and South Carolina. The table of appropriations shows that, on the 
whole, these schools are well supported, though in some States the funds allowed 
are not sufficient to secure either the teaching force or the material appliances re- 
quired. The Western States, it will be observed, are fully up to the standard of the 
older Eastern States in respect to this provision. Thus, Wisconsin, admitted as a 
State in 1848, population (census of 1880), 1,315,497, maintains four State normal 
schools, appropriations for two of these for the current year being $37,365. New Jer- 
sey, with about the same population (1,131,116), maintains one State normal school ; 
appropriation for the year, $20,000. Nebraska, admitted as a State in 1867, established 
a State normal school the same year. The appropriation to this school for 1884 was 
$14,350, alittle more than the appropriations reported for three of the four State normal

. OX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schoolsof Maine. The appropriations to the three State normal schools of Minnesota 
for the year amount to $39,000. 
The support given to the provision for taining tendon in these comparatively new 
States is one of the many evidences of the unanimity of feeling with respect to popu- 
lar education characterizing the settlers from the East and from foreign countries. 
The multiplication of normal schools in the Southern States is an important fact 
in the recent history of popular education in our country. In 1867 the Richmond 
Normal School, Richmond, Va., and the State Normal School (Marshall College), Hun- 
tington, W. Va., were established. These were the earliest normal schools, organized 
as such,in the States that have received the benefit of the Peabody fund. Now 
35 public normal schools are reported from these States, with appropriations from 
public funds amounting for the year, so far asreported to this Office, to $212,228. 
The following comparative table shows more fully the development of this class of 
schools in the Southern States:

The legislature of Louisiana at the session of 1883 passed an act to establish a State 
normal school, to be located at the city or town offering, in the judgment of the 
board of education, the greatest facilities for the establishment and success of such 
an institution. Natchitoches was finally selected, but the organization of the school 
is delayed by an unfortunate accident. By some oversight, the appropriation ($6,000) 
named in the bill was omitted from the general appropriation act, so that the matter 
will probably be held in abeyance until the mecting of the general assembly in 1886. 
While the purpose of the State normal schools is everywhere the same, viz, the 
training of teachers for the common schools, the courses of study, methods of train- 
ing, and standards of attainment which they present differ greatly. States in which 
the public school system is of long standing and includes ample provision for advanced 
courses of study naturally require a higher degree of preparation in the teachers 
of the common schools than is possible in States in which popular education is a 
matter of recent interest or in which the population is scattered and largely pioneer 
in character. 
The province and functions of normal schools haye been prolific subjects of discus- 
sion in educational conferences for the past few years, and the result is apparent in 
a clearer conception of the special character of the work on the part of those to whom 
it is intrusted and in more definite and satisfactory results on the part of the students. 
In this improyement all of the schools have participated to a greater or less degree. 
The importance of drawing public attention to the operation of these schools cannot 
be too strongly insisted upon. 
Often they are hampered by public opposition at the very time when principles and 
methods that have been brought to light and established by long and patient effort 
on their part are receiving favorable recognition. 
That view of the interior working and far-reaching influence of one of these insti- 
tutions which was so impressively set forth by Dr. Edward Brooks! in his farewell 
    
1 Dr. Edward Brooks, for seventeen years principal of the normal school, Millersville, Pa., resigned 
in 1883, and delivered his farewell address at the commencement exercises in that year.
-P-A-G-E-112
    CxiIl REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
address as principal of the normal school, Millersville, Pa., could be paralleled by 
many other schools of this class. He said: 
In assuming the duties of principal, I had certain ideals in respect to the character 
and work of a normal school which I have endeavored to realize during my admin- 
istration. The first and leading object at which I aimed was the thorough scholastic 
and professional training of the students. It was my ambition to make the Millers- 
ville Normal School one of the very best in the State or country. To accomplish the 
first part of this object, the several departments of instruction were more distinctly 
organized, the salaries of the professors were raised, and persons with special qualifi- 
cations placed and kept at the head of these different departments. These changes 
were rewarded by the wide reputation of our students for thorough scholastic prepa- 
ration in whatever branches they had studied or pretended to teach. In the depart- 
ment of professional training, a thorough knowledge of the nature of the mind was 
regarded as lying at the foundation of a teacher’s work; and the course in mental 
philosophy became a source of inspiration and power to our graduates, not only as 
teachers, but in the various vocations of life in which they engaged. In the science 
and art of teaching, the effort was made to ground the student teachers in the broad 
and fundamental principles of education, and to train them to make a practical 
application of these principles in the actual work of the school room. 
In the practice of teaching, special attention was given to primary instruction; and 
the character of this work is indicated by the fact that many of the most practical 
methods of the so-called Quincy system had never been heardof. In addition to this, 
the effort was made to show the dignity and excellence of the teacker’s vocation and 
to inspire the minds of the pupils with a love for and a desire of high attainments in 
the profession of teaching. Though never fully reaching my ideal, the value of the 
work that was accomplished may be indicated by theenthusiasm and efficiency of our 
pupils and graduates as teachers and educators, many of whom are to-day occupying 
distinguished positions as teachers in high and normal schools, city and county super- 
intendents, &c. Indeed I may be permitted to say that the methods of teaching 
which have been worked out in this school havo not only given skill and success to 
the thousands of pupils educated here, but are to-day largely in use from Maine to 
Oregon and Texas, aiding in giving direction and inspiration tothe work of education 
all over our broad country. ; 
  ABSTRACT OF RECENT CORRESPONDENCE ABOUT THE SALARIES OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
PRINCIPALS. 
Many inquiries have been addressed to this Office as to the salaries of principals 
of normal schools, a matter which must obviously have great weight in determining 
the character and efficiency of the schools. The following statement, compiled from 
recent information, shows the salaries of the principals of normal schools in 27 States 
in 1884: ‘ 
Alabama: School at Florence, $1,500; at Marion, $1,200; at Tuskegee, $900; at 
Huntsville, $675; annual session of nine months.

    PEDAGOGICS IN UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
Chairs of pedagogies or didactics have been established in the Universities of Mich- 
igan, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. Johns Hopkins University has in 
various ways made its influence felt upon the teaching profession, and its work in 
this direction promises to be greatly extended through the lectureship of psychology 
which has been accepted by G. Stanley Hall, pu. D. 
The distinction between this department of the university and the work of the 
normal school should be kept clearly in mind. The training of the normal schools 
will, under some circumstances, merge into that of the universities; under others, 
it may be possible and desirable that the two should be pursued simultaneousiy ; 
and always, if the university training in pedagogics be sound and strong, it will 
make itself felt in the work of the normal schools; nevertheless, the two are suf- 
ficiently removed from each other in character and purpose to prevent waste of re- 
sources and confusion or antagonism of effort. In Germany the training school on 
the one side and the pedagogic department of the universities on the other have full 
development. In Great Britain it is coming to be more and more clearly recognized 
that both are alike essential in maintaining a high standard of excellence among 
teachers, inspectors, and other officers directly engaged in the service of education. 
The separate functions of the two.agencies wee very freely discussed at the Interna- 
tional Conference on Education held in London in connection with the Health Exhi- 
bition, the university side of the work being treated with special force ard discrim- 
“ination. While it would be impossible to give here any summary of the papers read 
or the discussions which they called fourth, I present a few observations by some of the 
speakers: 
THE UNIVERSITIES IN RELATION TO TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
[Extract from a paper presented by Rev. R. H. Quick, formerly lecturer on pedagogics at the Univer- sity of Cambridgo.} 
The universities ought to be the brains of our social system. They naturally attract 
many of the best intellects in the country and they afford them the most favorable 
conditions for working. A vast amount of thought has already been given to the 
theory of education and a numberof valuable principles have already been established. 
Let the universities appoint able men to bring these principles together and to apply 
them to the solution of the educational problems of our time. In this way the uni- 
versities will fulfil the function of the brain and get the thinking done. There will 
be plenty of practice in any case, and it is only by. thinking that the universities can 
affect it. Undirected or misdirected activity is the chief danger of our time. * * 
All I wish to urge is this, that the distinctive function of a university is not action, 
but thought, and that the best thing the universities can do for schoolmasters is to 
employ some of their keenest intellects in considering education on the side of theory 
anuin teaching such principles respecting it as have been or can be established. 
PROFESSORSHIPS AND LECTURESHIPS ON EDUCATION. 
[Extract from a paper presented by J. M. D. Meiklejohn, M. A., professor of the theory, history, aud 
practice of education in the University of St. Andrews.] 
I will put the question I have been trying to answer in another way. What can 
the universities do for education? What can they do for the processes that are going 
on daily in our schools? A university is a place forstudy and research; but it is also 
a place for distribution. It tries to distribute first hand knowledge along with the

  germs of further growth in it; and it tries to give bo its alumni the best culture. Can 
we not find within its walls men who will give their whole lives to observing’ and 
thinking about the different processes that go by the name of education, just as we 
have men who give their lives to medicine, or to anatomy, or to physical science ? 
The universities might now at length say: We will study how all this should be 
done—under what conditions, and how it may be best done; we will begin at the 
beginning, and we will not shut out from the scope of our inquiries any kind of men- 
tal procedure whatever. We will test the experience of teachers and try to make the 
best experience of all teachers ayailable for each one—and that the youngest. We 
will study methods, and try to make onr methods living We will show the best 
means of having clear perceptions, of forming clear and adequate conceptions, and of 
coming to true and full judgments. We will show how a teacher may make his school 
a scene of search, of creative work—of happy search and of happy creative work. 
We will not merely examine schools; we will guide and teach and inspire them. We 
will further produce a body of literature which will inform the young teacher on all 
that he requires to know; and we will do this, not by fits and starts, but in a system- 
atic, persistent, and vigorous fashion. And, while we hope to teach the teacher 
and show him how to form the young and growing minds of England, we hope, at the 
same time, to learn as much from our pupils as they learn from us. As we try to con- 
nect ourselves with and to be of use to all the learned professions, this profession of 
teaching — which shapes the intelligence of the nation at each remove and lies at the 
basis of all the other professions — shall now be our special and our sacred care. 
Professors of education, then, stand for method and for methods, for a careful search 
after the new and a frank criticism of the old, for first-handness in thought, culture, 
and knowledge, for fidelity in distribution, for the introduction of the growing and 
receiving mind to all that is best in art, in science, in history, and in expression, 
The objection to special training in the theory and art of teaching on the ground 
that the acquisition of general knowledge, under the guidance of expert instructors, 
accustoms one to the methods most effective in the work of imparting instruction, 
has been well met by 8,8. Laurie, M. a., professor of education, University of Edin- 
burgh. He says: 
We are told that our public schools have such admirable methods and so noble a 
tradition in teaching that young men who enter them as assistants, and who have 
themselves been public schoo] boys, are ‘‘to the manner born,” and, if they have any- 
thing to learn, will soon learn it by watching the head master and submitting them- 
selves to his advice. That the young assistant will by these means acquire the habit 
of his school, whatever that may be, 1do not doubt. But is that habit a good one? 
Has the Yead master himself studied philosophy and method? Is he not simply re- 
peating his predecessors? Or is he perchance inspired ? No one will be found at this 
time of day to defend Keatism as it flourished at Eton, fagging in the forms it 
assumed at certain public schools, and other brutalities which brought shame on the 
name of christian, not to speak of the name of educator. I do not suppose any one, 
save a survival in some grammar school situated in some region remote and melan- 
choly and slow, will defend the method of acquiring the Latin grammar by imposing 
the learning of Latin rules. 1 do not suppose that any competent head master now 
maintains that the sole engine of moral discipline is the constant rod. I do not sup- 
pose that ignorance of geography, of history, of English, of the facts and laws of nature, 
will now be regarded as an essential characteristic of the best English education. These 
things are mostly of the past. But why? To what is all thisdue? To writers on edu- 
cation, to the progress of society generally, and to one or two distinguished practical 
educators, such as Arnold. Were Arnold alive now and were he to initiate a conrse 
of lectures on education at Oxford, would our present head masters not think it de- 
sirable that their future assistants should sit at his feet for a couple of terms? There 
isno Arnold now, but nature repeats a type though it neverrepeats anindividual. The 
optical law whereby an object becomes smaller the further it isremoved from the eye 
is inverted in the case of men. The distance to which death removes them makes 
them larger, not smaller. You may have confidence that God did not exhaust Himself 
in the pedagogic fild when he made Arnold. There was still some energy left for 
the production of men who could teach others to teach and inspire them with the 
noble aims of true educators of youth. Grant that, through the influences to which 
I have alluded, we are now better than in the past, yet surely it is the insanity of 
self satisfaction to conclude that now at this time of speaking, in August, 1884, our 
public schools and middle schools and primary schools are at last perfect in their 
aims, methods, and discipline. Even if they were, would it not be desirable that the 
young aspirant should be introduced to the principles which underlie and explain and 
vindicate that perfection, and to the instructive history whereby that perfection has 
been happily reached, that so he may be guarded against degeneracy, and that a 
school of education may preserve for the future all that is good in the present?

  * NORMAL INSTRUCTION, CxXV 
Hlad Roger Ascham’s College, at Cambridge, founded a lectureship on the first two 
hooks of Quintilian and on Ascham’s own work, and done nothing more, the whole 
character of English public school education would have been revolutionized morethan 
200 years ago. We should have been as great a nation, measured by the standards 
of imperial power and wealth, but our citizens would have had a better use of their 
brains, greater love of truth, more open minds, more kindly hearts, more of wisdom, 
justice, and righteousness. If I did not believe this, I should give up the whole 
question of ‘‘how to educate” as vain and empty talk; but I should have at the 
same time to give up my belief in humanity and in the possibility of a true civil- 
ization. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
{By Dr. Stoy, lecturing professor and principal of the training college at the University of Jena, Saxe-Weimar.] 
Iam glad to see that one of the most important problems in the life of any civilized 
nation, the training of teachers, figures among the subjects in the program of the 
educational conference. In most countries the plan of studies, both in the classical 
and the modern schools, is such as to be positively injurious to the physical and moral 
health of the pupils, and rather to disgust them vith their studies. But a reform of 
schools is impossible without a reform of the training system for teachers. By what 
means can a reform be carried out ? 
Now, in the first place, it stands to reason that masters or teachers at higher schools 
cannot possibly be trained and led in the right way by a few occasional hints only. 
Secondly, a thoroughly systematic and methodical course of training is absolutely 
necessary to obtain good, efficient teachers. Thirdly, it is a fact flat all attempts 
made at German universities to train masters, without the strictest discipline, have 
been either without a satisfactory result or absolutely fruitless. 
Permit me to lay before you the principles on which I have trained masters for 
more than 25 years in the training college at the University of Jena, Saxe-Weimar, 
a college long since founded and attached to the university and reorganized in 1876 
by an enlightened government on the basis of my method. A large number of mas- 
ters, principals, and inspectors in Germany have gone forth from the Jena Training 
College. 
My training college has two courses: 
First course. Principles and theory: (1) In order to avoid and prevent all mechan- 
ical cramming and superficial varnish in the place of a thorough education, the train- 
ing college student has to work his way through the whole system of philosophic 
pedagogics. Thus he becomes acquainted with the leading ideas and aims for teach- 
ing work, discipline, and health. (2) He has to study psychology to enable him to 
find the proper ways and means of dealing with his pupils, (3) In order to find ex- 
amples and models for his vocation, he also studies the history of education. 
Second course. Practical training: (1) The practical application of theory consists 
in the training college student learning how to control himself in his didactic inter- 
course with the pupils. (2) For this purpose a complete schgol of several classes or 
forms must be attached to the training college. (3) Every student is directed and 
guided in his teaching work in one special form, and later on in all the forms and all 
the branches gradually. (4) Every student works outa plan or program for every 
lesson he is going to give, and hands it over to the principal for approval. (5) Dur- 
ing the class work other students and the principal himself are present. (6) The 
teaching work done in the classes is thoroughly criticised in special conferences by 
the principal and others who have attended. (7) In this manner every student is 
taught how to’criticise not only others, but himself as well, and thus he turns theory 
into succum et sanguinem. 
It is gratifying to know that the progress of pedagogics in our universities is at- 
tracting much attention abroad. The work of Professor Payne in Michigan Uniyer- 
sity was particularly referred to in the conference. Rev. R. H. Quick observes : 
The very mention of universities and the training of teachers will at once suggest to 
you the names of Professors Laurie and Meiklejohn in Scotland and Payne! in 
America. 
    
'The following paper presents in brief outline the course of instruction developed by Professor 
Payne: 
INSTRUCTION IN PEDAGOGICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.

  CXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The importance of bringing all grades and classes of schools into closer relation with 
one another and of securing to the largest possible number of teachers the best scho- 
lastic influences is coming to be more and more clearly recognized in all civilized 
countries. Itis seen to be especially desirable that certain resources which can 
only be found in the highest and most richly endowed institutes should be available 
in the training of teachers, even of those who are not likely to reach the privilege by 
matriculation in these superior institutions. This isa matter which has also pro- 
voked much recent discussion and effort in England. 
‘The movement has valuable suggestion for us, although the conditions of superior 
and elementary institutions of Great Britain difier materially from those of this coun- 
try. The desirability of closer affiliation between the training colleges and the uni- 
versities was urged by Mr. T. E. Heller, at a recent meeting of the executive com. 
mittee of the National Union of Elementary Teachers.!_ Mr. Heller moved ‘that in 
the opinion of this executive it is desirable that the training colleges for schoolmas- 
ters should be affiliated to the universities and the curriculum so modified as to carry 
Queen’s scholars forward to the university degrees.” 
I quote as follows from his speech in support of the motion, as reported in the 
School Board Chronicle: 
The motion, he said, was a difficult one to press to a practical conclusion, and he 
was of opinion that it would not be possible to effect the reform all at once, but that 
it must be a gradual process, extending over a number of years. The general idea 
underlying the motion was that it would be an enormous advantage to education, 
and also to the teaching profession, if the general education of teachers were not 
separated so much, as at present, from the general literary life of the country, and 
not so specialized as to put—almost without achance of removing it—a class mark 
upon those acting in the position of elementary teachers. This question was also con- 
nected very closely — though he did not wish to make much of that point at present — 
with the idea that the certifying power for a profession should not be under govern- 
ment control. The granting of the certificates by the education department made 
the elementary teacher, in a certain measure, the creature of the department, and 
placed him very much at its merey. During the last eight years there had been a 
considerable tendency in the direction indicated by this motion. Fourteen years ago 
he had a conversation on this subject with the present inspector of training colleges, 
and knowing that he wasin sympathy with the general idea of assimilating the train- 
ing college course, as much as possible, and the university course, he felt confident 
that he would endeavor to make changes in that direction. He therefore felt bound, 
while criticising the curriculum of training colleges, to acknowledge the very sub- 
stantial change which had been made bit by bit, and, as it appeared to him, timidly, 
in the direction of bringing it nearer to that of the London University. His idea was 
that, by the codperation of the training colleges and the university authorities, it 
might be possible in the future to practically afiiliate the training colleges to the uni- 
versities, so that residence in the traming college might count for a certain term and   
about 65. On the average, about one-half the students in each graduating class have received in- 
struction in this subject. 
4, Three conditions are required for obtaining a teacher's diploma: the degree of bachelor; a 
teacher's course; one of the longer courses in pedagogics (see calendar 1882~’83, p. 77). This diploma 
has no legal value. 
5. The courses in pedagogics, as now organized, are as follows: 
First semester — (1) Practical: The art of teaching and governing; methods of instrnction and gen" 
eral school room practice; school hygiene; schoul law. Recitations and lectures: text book, Fitch's 
Lectures on Teaching; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Fric 2-3. Professor Payne. 
(3) School supervision: Embracing gencral school management; the art of grading and arranging 
courses of study; the conduct of institutes, &c. Recitations and lectures: text book, chapters on 
School Supervision ; Monday and Wednesday, 8.15-9.15. Professor Payne. 
(5) The historical development of educational systems and methods. Lectures: Tuesday and 
Thursday, 5-6. Professor Payne. a 
Second semester.—(2) '‘Vheoretical and critical. Lectures: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Friday, 2-3. Professor Payne. : 
(4) Seminary: For the study and discussion of special topics in the history and philosophy of cdu- 
cation. Monday and Wednesday, 8.15-9.15. Professor Payne. 
A prescribed course of reading will be required in connection with courses 1 and 2. Either course 
1 or course 2 is requisite to obtain a teacher's diploma. Students whose purpose is to prepare them- 
selves for ordinary school room duties are advised to pursue course 1; those who propose % assume 
the management of high schools or of graded schools should take course 3 in connection with 
course 1. 
6. The attendance for the first semester, 1883-'84, is as follows: Course 1, 30; course 3, 15; course 
5, 10.

go to shorten the necessary term of residence at a university, if any one wished to 
complete the university degree on leaying the training college. They had some en- 
couragement in this matter from what was done in Scotland. There the universities 
were on a totally different basis from the universities in England. In Scotland, they 
were, to an extent which was almost lamentable, doing what the best secondary and 
high schools were doing in this country. The entrance to the university in Seotland 
was often a mere show. There was no examination. Any one might go up to Gias- 
gow straight from the plough or the shop, without knowing anything, and by paying 
his matriculation fee of 31. be entered as an undergraduate. ‘The Scotch were now 
endeavoring to insist upon an entrance examination. The Scotch code provided that 
certain Queen’s scholars whose names were specially marked in the list might, during 
their residence in the training college, attend the courses at the university. Frou. a 
conversation with Mr. Boyd during the past week, he found that 53 per cent. of the 
students in his college—and the number was about the same for colleges generally — 
had during their two years’ residence in the training college completed three terms 
at the university. When it was remembered that a degree for any university in 
Great Britain was recognized for higher appointments, it was clear that the teachers 
who were being trained in Scotland, whatever might be the comparative value of the 
various degrees, were gaining a professional advantage over the English students. 
A movement had been going on for some years for the extension of university teach- 
ing among the working classes and the general population in the towns, and he could 
conceive of no plan which would carry university influence and the tone of univer- 
sity education more among the people than through the teachers in the elementary 
schools. This idea should be supporied by all who proclaimed their desire to sup- 
port a university extension scheme. He had gone carefully through the present cur- 
riculum of training colleges, and, notwithstanding the very excellent changes dur- 
ing the past six or eight years, a great deal of the course was still for the best of the 
Queen’s scholars a waste of time. He thought they had got into a stereotyped style 
of education. They devoted too much time to the mere facts of geography and his- 
tory and to knowledge which was no doubt useful and valuable, and which they 
could have in their elementary schools, but which a well trained mind would be able 
to get up for the occasion at any time. This valuable period of training should be 
pixen to training and culture instead of getting up mere facts. The subject had 
een brought under the notice of the authorities at Oxford. There seemed to be 
every disposition at Cambridge to fall in with some such arrangement in the case of 
the colleges that were near the universities. It might be possible, with the consent 
of the training colleges, to have the university professors going to the colleges 
to give certain courses of lectures, as in the case of Nottingham and other colleges 
which had been affiliated with Cambridge. There seemed to be a general desire for 
this change, and the thing now to do would be to strike out a practical plan. Until 
he had had communications with the officers of training colleges, it would be almost 
impossible to strike out the exact form which this movement should take; but he 
had no hesitation in moving this resolution in general terms proposed. This would 
necessarily result in the establishment of a faculty of education at the university, 
and that would be the stamp which would mark the teacher of the elementary, mid- 
dle, or higher school. Fora long time he felt that the universities were not the 
proper parties, but he had changed his views, and now believed that public opinion 
would not so easily recognize any certifying authority outside the department as the 
universities. It would be a great advantage in affiliating the training colleges to the 
university if the colleges were in the same town. They could then be put under the 
discipline of the university, and it would be possible to get not only the passing of 
a university test, but a university education, which was a totally different thing. 
If the London University became a leading university, there would be a number of 
training colleges at once brought within range of university influence. Several of 
the other colleges were also within easy reach of the universities. He could see that 
it would be possible ultimately to get the i'ea carried out effectively. He would be 
satisfied if, on this occasion, they would affirm the desirability of it without binding 
themselves to any definite plan, and would authorize him to pursue the inquiries of- 
ficially, and see whether the union could not be the instrument for carrying it out,

_ BUSINESS COLLEGES——KINDERGAERTEN, CXIX 
As appears from the tabular comparative exhibit in the last ten years, the number 
of commercial and business colleges reporting to this Office, as also the number of in- 
structors and of students in them, has nearly doubled. During the same time the ed- 
ucational influence of this class of schools has noticeably increased, a result largely 
due to the annual conventions of the Business Educators’ Association, in which there 
has been the freest, fullest discussions of the methods and standards of instruction 
thus far adopted in the United States. The obvious adaptation of these schools 
to an imperative demand existing in business centres has done much to bring about 
the introduction of business courses in public high schools and private academies and 
‘seminaries. The desirability of such courses cannot be questioned, but it is important 
that they should have something more than a merely nominal existence. They 
should be based upon sound preliminary training in the common school branches 
and should be characterized by an adherence to the subjects and methods that ex- 
perience approves for this special training. The instruction should be facilitated by 
the various appliances available for business correspondence and by museums of 
the staple materials of commercial interchange. In respect to the last mentioned aid, 
and also the extent to which modern languages should enter into business courses, 
_we have much to learn from the conduct of foreign schools of this class.

CXxX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
By reference to Table V, it will be seen that, excepting the year 1877, there has 
been a steady increase in the number of Kindergiirten, Kindergarten instructors, and 
pupilsfrom year to year during the decade. This increase is mainly due to the efforts 
of associations formed in several of our large cities for the purpose of establishing 
these infant schools for the benefit of the poor. More than half the schools reported 
in the table have been opened through such agencies in the cities of Boston, New 
York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco. 
Frébel’s system of infant training appears to be peculiarly fitted to overcome the 
influence of inherited vicious propensities and physical infirmities. It is largely on 
account of the results accomplished with vagrant and neglected children that thought- 
ful parents among the better classes have been impressed with the excellence of the 
system asa means of moral development, so that wherever charity Kindergiirten have 
prospered there has arisen a demand for private Kindergiirten. No tabulated state- 
ment can convey an adequate idea of the work going on under the auspices of the 
societies referred to. This can only be understood by a knowledge of the misery and 
degradation from which the poor little children are gathered to be humanized and 
trained in the Kindergarten. In Boston the work has been mainly supported by Mrs. 
Q. A. Shaw, under whose munificent patronage no less than 30 Kindergiirten and 10 
nurseries have been established, the work not being limited to Boston, but extending 
into adjoining towns; one Kindergarten at the south end of Boston is entirely sup- 
ported by Mrs. James Tolman. The Office has received no recent particulars of the 
work in New York City, but the efforts in this direction of the Society for Ethical Cult- 
ure, presided over by Prof. Felix Adler, and of several church societies are well 
known. 
In Philadelphia a large number of free Kindergiirten have been established under 
the auspices of the various ward associations. The Subprimary School Society has 
been formed for the especial promotion and caro of this work. Twenty-four schools 
are already reported, accommodating about 750 children. Some of these schools have 
day nurseries attached and 2 are for colored children. The society will extend the 
work as fast as funds are provided. 
In Chicago 2 societies have been formed for the purpose of establishing charity 
Kindergirten, viz, the Chicago Frébel Kindergarten Association and the Chicago Free 
Kindergarten Association. The former has now 9 Kindergiirten under its manage- 
ment, into which are gathered some 400 children; the latter has 12 schools, with an 
attendance of 850 children. 
In 1881 a Kindergarten department was established in the Cook County Normal 
School, and in 1883 the training class that had been opened in Chicago under the 
auspices of the Chicago Frébel Kindergarten Association was removed to the nor- 
mal school upon the invitation of the superintendent, Col. Francis W. Parker. The 
principal of this class, Mrs. Alice H. Putnam, reports that during the current year 
a series of lessons has been given to the senior class of the normal school on the use 
of Kindergarten material. This is an experiment that is followed with unusual in- 
terest, as it tends to bring the principles and methods of the Frébel system into 
practice in the common schools of Cook County. 
The 3 societies of San Francisco, viz, Public Kindergarten Association, Golden Gate 
(formerly Jackson street) Kindergarten Association, and the new Silver Street Kin- 
dergarten Society, are working with undiminished ardor. Nineteen public or charity 
schools were reported in September, 1883, and the number has since been increased. 
The movement has met with such signal success in that city and so many inquiries 
have arisen as to the ways and means by which it has been promoted that I deem it 
advisable to give room to somewhat extended statements from the reports of two of the 
societies, which will serve to show how the various forces that are essential to the 
work are brought into united action in that city. The following is from the report 
of the Golden Gate Kindergarten Association for the year ending October 6, 1884: 
The coming of October 6 brings our anniversary day. The past has been a year of 
unprecedented growth and prosperity in our Kindergarten work, The progress made 
     
-P-A-G-E-121

has been far in excess of any former year. As will be seen by the treasurer’s report, 
the receipts of the past year are more than double those of the preceding year. Stand- 
ing at this fifth milestone, it is well to take a brief retrospect of the Heaven-blest 
work, With a monthly pledge of $7.50 and with faith in God and goodness, the first 
Kindergarten class was opened at 116 Jackson street, in the very heart of the Barbary 
Coast, on October 6, 1879. 
Rapid growth of the work. — At the close of the first year two classes had been or: 
ganized, containing an enrolment of about 100 children, The treasurer’s report showed 
the total receipts for the tirst year to be $1,805.70. Perhaps a briefly summarized 
statement of the five years’ work would best show the progress made. .

The total enrolment of children at the close of last year was 342. During the present 
year this enrolment has been increased by 125 additional scholars. As nearly as can 
be estimated, the Jackson Street Kindergarten Association during the five years of its 
existence has had over 1,200 httle children under its protection and training. A large 
proportion of these children were under 5 years of age. Many of them were from 2} 
to 4 years old.. In a single class, at 116 Jackson street, 25 little ones were but 3 years 
of age, and a number of them were even under that age. 
Necessity for incorporation.— Up to the close of the present fiscal year the work of 
the association has been carried forward in the same quiet way in which it was first 
orgamzed ; but the rapid growth of the work has necessitated a change in our organic 
structure. It has been found necessary to incorporate the society. This issue was 
summarily forced upon us by the munificent legacy of $20,000 devised by a stanch 
and devoted friend of the Kindergarten work. In drawing up the will it was ascer- 
tained by the attorney in charge that the Jackson Street Kindergarten Association 
was not an incorporated society and could only receive such a bequest by the ap- 
pointment of trustees for the special purpose. Trustees were appointed and the be- 
quest was made. This legacy was soon followed by another proposed bequest, but 
this time the parties, on learning that the society was unincorporated, decided to 
await incorporation. It was at once resolved to tuke steps looking to incorpora- 
tion, which was accomplished October 6, 1884. * * * In connection with this 
step it was deemed advisable to change the name of the association and call it the 
“‘Cooper Kindergarten Association,” in compliment to Mrs. Cooper, who is the 
head and front of the organization. To this that lady earnestly objected, on the 
ground that she would be much hampered in her work for the Kindergartea if her own 
name were used for its title. Mrs. Cooper proposed, instead, the name of the Golden 
Gate Kindergarten Association as being suitable, not merely on account of its beau- 
titul figurative sense, but as being a unique name among the several benevolent as- 
sociations of the city. A ballot was taken, the result being that the name of Golden 
Gate was unanimously adopted. 
The great work of the year.—On the anniversary birthday of her beloved son Mrs. 
Stanford sent to Mrs. Cooper the sum of $4,000, to be used for the Kindergarten 
work under her charge. It was decided to use this sacred offering in the establish- 
ment of a memorial Kindergarten to be named for the beautiful and gifted son. 
Everything was done to make this, in all respects,a model Kindergarten. It has 
been pronounced by visitors from the East and others well qualified to judge the best 
equipped and best appointed free Kindergarten in the country. There are 100 little 
children enrolled in 2 classes. There are 2 principals, competent, retined, devoted, 
and faithful, with 2 assistants of ke spirit and temper. The work moves on in 
rhythmic harmony and the good accomplished cannot be estimated. * * * 
In a brief address made by Mrs. Cooper on the occasion of the formal opening of 
the Stanford Free Kindergarten, she stated that the only sad feature of the work in 
this city is the utter inability to provide for the clamorous little ones that plead for 
admission to these schools. She further went on to state that not only are all the 
Kindergiirten under this association thus crowded, but that scores have been turned 
away from all the free Kindergiirten, including Silver street, Folsom street, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
CXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
New Kindergarten of the First Congregational Church on Harrison street. In speaking 
of the latter she said: ‘‘ Being at the Folsom Street Kindergarten on Monday morning, 
the 14th, I was pained to see the tearful mothers as they learned there was no room for 
their children. Every inch of room was occupied. Knowing that the First Congrega- 
tional Church was to open its Kindergarten that morning I said: ‘Wait a few minutes 
and I will go around and see if there is room at the new Kindergarten for your little 
ones; it is only three squares off.’ Going over to the hall I found that 15 children 
had already been turned away, and it was then only about 9 o’clock of the openin; 
day. I had no good news to carry back to the waiting anxious mothers. This,” 
continued Mrs. Cooper, ‘‘ is the experience we have in all our free Kindergiirten. We 
cannot possibly accommodate the little ones that come.” 
The Produce Exchange Class, opened August 8, 1884, owes its existence to a dona- 
tion that gave rise to the following correspondence: 
San Franoisco Propuce Excnaner, 
425 California street. 
Mrs. Saran B, CooPER: 
Dear Mapam: I have great pleasure in inclosing you a check for $125, collected at 
the polls, for the Jackson Street Kindergarten, at the annual election of the San Fran- 
cisco Produce Exchange, held this day. This is an improvement over our effort last 
year and shows an increased interest taken by our meibers in the noble charity over 
which you preside. : With the wish that our mite may be some help in the rescue of the little ones, I 
remain yours, respectfully, 
JOHN WIGHTMAN, Jr. 
San Francrsco, July 15, 1884. " 
Mr. Jounn WiGHTMAN, Jr.: 
My Dear Sir: Your kind letter, inclosing (the generous check from the Produce 
Exchange, is just at hand. In behalf of our board of management, in bebalf of the 
little children whom it will enable us to train and bless, and in my own behalf, I send 
herewith a vote of heartfelt thanks. 
It isa matter of fervent and grateful joy that your interest in our work increases 
in proportion to your acquaintance with it. Thisis a never failing experience ; hence 
it is that we cordially welcome all thoughtful and philanthropic citizens to our Kin- 
dergiirten, that they may see the work and what is being done through it for the 
neglected little ones of the city. 
As to the disposition of your gift, you will hear before many days, as it will en- 
able us to carry out a long cherished plan for enlarging our work at Jackson street. 
With sentiments of sincere and grateful appreciation, I am, most truly, yours, 
SARAH B. COOPER. 
San Francisco, July 16, 1884. 
Mrs. Kate S. Wiggin, superintendent of the Silver Street Kindergarten, made an 
earnest appeal in behalf of the free Kindergarten work of the Pacific coast, which 
appeared in the Chronicle, Bulletin, and Examiner of September 10, as follows: 
To those who have kind hearts and full purses : 
Seventy little children, between the ages of 4 and 5 years, have been turned 
away from the Silver Street Kindergarten since July 9, and we have 150 in daily at- 
tendance, all we can possibly provide for in our two departments. 
It is certain that 40 of these 70 applicants for admission came from poor and 
wretched homes; some were the children of hard working people who try to help 
themselves ; others belong to parents whose only heritage to their little ones has been 
sorrow, misery, and vice. 
One must have a heart of stone to shut the door upon these children, knowing 
the street life outside, the vile language, vicious habits, idleness, and worthlessness 
which it fosters, and realizing what is inside: joy, plenty, love, truth, industry, gen- 
erosity, frugality, and perseverance in well doing. We have come to the conclusion 
not to shut the door any longer, and that it is a lack of faith on our part not to make an 
endeavor to enlarge an already enormous work. 
It is true that all our city Kindergirten are at present receiving support from our 
est and most generous citizens; but we feel it possible that some benevolent and
-P-A-G-E-123

wealthy soul is pining because he has never been asked to contribute, some rich 
bachelor who wants to give dovble because he has no children of his own, some 
happy father who desires to give treble, as an expression of gratitude for his own 
fortunate and innocent little ones. We would modestly suggest that here is an op- 
portunity, and for the benefit of such I make, with full concurrence of my training 
class, the following proposition, viz: 
To establish at once, superintend, and maintain two or three branch classes at a 
nominal expense, under these conditions and with this amount of money: 
Branou No. 1.—Silver Street Kindergarten. 
      Rent of additional room per month - $10 00 
Share of janitor’s work 3 00 
2 00    Share of piano rent... 
1 
Fifty dollars’ worth of love given gratis. 
This class will contain 30 to 40 children, who will be cared for and educated at 
the rate of $1.30 a month and receive the untiring devotion of cultured and skilful 
teachers. If ten persons will send their names and a subszription of $4 a month, or 
twenty, with $2 a month, we will publish the list, buy the furniture and appliances 
at our own risk, and open the first class under the wing of the Silver street institu- 
tion on October 1. 
If the names roll in by hundreds and thousands, we will cheerfully superintend 
a second branch class in any of Mrs. Cooper’s Kindergarten, her work being virtually 
one with ours. This must not be taken, however, as a fair estimate of the cost of 
Kindergarten work. You can see that it will be almost wholly a labor of love. It 
means a heavy drain upon the time and energies of the few who are capable and will- 
ing, and a large measure of voluntary labor from a training class, which is already 
assisting in 6 free Kindergiirten. And then there are very few unoccupied kindergart- 
ners who can afford for $15 a month to give a general supervision which would be worth 
$40 at least; so that these branch classes will be supported for less than half the usual 
expense. Nevertheless, we feel that, if the children were grouped and taught for one 
year in this way, the furniture and apparatus would be in readiness, and those would 
be found who, during the next year, would assist us in placing the work on a stronger 
foundation. 
And now we leave the plan with you, hoping that we have not rushed into print 
for no result. Do not give your money blindly when you can visit the free Kinder- 
garten and see what they are doing. The work will bear inspection, and the happy 
faces of the children themselves will draw the dollar from the most reluctant pocket. 
Please send name and address with your subscription, marking it ‘‘For Kindergar- 
ten Branch Class No.1,” adding the unspoken thought, ‘‘ God bless the work and the 
children thus gathered.” 
Yours, for the children’s sake, 
KATE D. 8. WIGGIN. 
The response to this appeal was a contribution of $40, by means of which a class 
called the Peabody Kindergarten was at once formed. : 
THE KINDERGARTEN AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Inquiry is constantly arising as to the prospect of the Kindergarten becoming a 
feature of our public school systems. The work in St. Louis, under the gratuitous 
supervision of Miss Susan E. Blow, has been followed with deep interest, as it has 
been generally felt that it was destined to become a permanent part of the public 
school work of that city. The lowest limit of the school age in that city, viz, 6 
years, raises a difficulty in the way of such a result which can only be met by legis- 
lation. So far the outlook is not encouraging. s 
In accordance with the recommendations of the special committee appointed by the
-P-A-G-E-124
    CXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
school board of Milwaukee in 1882 to inquire into the operations of the St. Louis 
Kindergiirten, it was determined to establish a pulMic Kindergarten in that city. 
In his annual address to the board for the year 1883 the president, Hon. Joshua 
Stark, says: 
‘The Kindergarten has during the past year been treated as part of our school sys- 
tem. Whether it shall be a permanent feature of the system will depend upon the 
wisdom and caution of future boards. That this is the true method of education for 
children of tender years is no longer questioned, and it should not be abandoned so 
long as we are compelled to provide schools for infants of 4.and 5 years. It requires 
of the teacher, however, something more than love for children or skill in their en- 
tertainment. The success and permanency of the Kindergarten, I think, depend upon 
the appointmer of mature, intelligent, and thoroughly qualified teachers to direct 
them, and judicious restriction of their cost. 
Theschool board of San Francisco has from the first manifested the deepest interest 
in the Kindergarten. Two of the Kindergirten established in that city have already 
been adopted by the board as connecting classes. Ata meeting of the classification 
cominittee of the board in the present year, at the instance of Deputy Superintendent 
O’Connor, it was decided to recommend that a Kindergarten teacher be employed, at 
an expense not to exceed $20 per month, to teach the normal class the Kindergarten 
system, and that all substitute teachers be required to take this instruction with the 
normal class at least once a week. This is an important step, for it is through the 
normal schools that the adjustment of Frébel’s system to our public schools must be 
made, if it is to be made at all. It was undoubtedly the recognition of this fact that 
led to the efforts before mentioned in reference to the introduction of a Kindergarten 
department in the Cook County Normal School, which department now includes a 
training class as well as Kindergarten. 
A number of the leading city superintendents have expressed themselves strongly 
in favor of the Kindergarten. Hon.§. A. Ellis, superintendent of schools, Rochester, 
N. Y., says in his report: 
In several cities of the country Kindergiirten have been established in connection 
with the public schools and under the management of the boards of education. 
While it would not at present be possible for this board to adopt this plan, I sincerely 
regret that the little ones who apply for admission to our primary grades every year 
are unable to have the excellent training these schools give to young children before 
they come to us. The work of these schools, as is well known, is largely ethical in 
its character, for Frébel believed that only through careful moral training of the 
young could the truest and noblest types of character be formed. 5 
We may not have the Kindergarten, but could the teachers in our primary schools 
catch a little of the spirit and enthusiasm of Frébel, and make some of his methods 
their own, there would soon be visible all along the line of our work the signs of in- 
creased moral growth and progress, 
KINDERGARTEN AT MADISON. 
The annual meeting of the Frébel Institute of North America was held at Madison in 
July, during the session of the National Educational Association. The meetings 
were largely attended and great interest was manifested in the proceedings. The Kin- 
dergarten exhibit formed an important feature of the educational exposition at the 
same place. Portions of it were arranged with special reference to illustrating the 
possibility of union between the Kindergarten and the public school training. In ad- 
dition to our own country, Japan and Switzerland were well represented. In the for- 
mer country, the encouragement of Kindergiirten is a noticeable feature of the recent 
progress in popular education. Seven of these schools were reported in 1882, and 
the system has obtained such favorable recognition that the following notification 
was issued during the present year by the education department: 
It being very injurious to children under school age (i.e., below 6 years) to admit 
them into schools and to give them the same education as children of school age, the 
government of each fu or ken shall cause such children to be trained according to 
the Kindergarten system,

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. : OXXXI 
Table VI presents the statistics of schools which report to this Office under the 
head of secondary instruction, In 1884 they numbered 1,588, having 7,923 instruc- 
tors and 152,354 pupils, as against 1,482 schools in 1882, having 7,449 instructors and 
138,384 pupils. The pupils are about evenly divided between the two sexes, the boys 
numbering 71,759 and the girls 75,897. Nearly one-half of the schools are conducted 
on the coeducation system, \ About three-fifths of the teachers employed are women. 
The total value of the property belonging to these schools, so far as reported, is 
$21,938,219; amount of productive funds, $11,351,526; income from these, $1,246,089; 
receipts from tuition fees for the current year, $2,395,699. 
Table VI, appendix, shows very clearly the status of the individual schools of this 
class with respect to endowments, patronage, income, and teaching power. 
Table VII embraces a class of schools engaged also in the work of secondary in- 
struction, but having more definite aim and more uniform character than the preced- 
ing. ‘The name preparatory indicates their special function, which is to fit pupils 
for college; and, although a large proportion of their pupils do not pass on to the 
superior institutions, their curriculum is determined by the college requirements. In 
1884 these schools numbered 169, having 1,183 instructors and 18,319 students, as 
against 157 schools in 1882, having 1,041 instructors and 15,681 students. Of the en- 
tire number of the preparatory schools, 128, or a little more than three-fourths, are in 
the New England and Middle Atlantic States. These include 75 per cent. of all the 
scholars in this class of schools, 82 per cent. of the property valuation, 93 per cent. of 
the income from productive funds, and 79 per cent. of the tuition fees. Au examina- 
tion of the table of benefactions, appendix, will show how largely both classes of 
schools are indebted for funds to the liberality of the people. ; 
The number of scholars they report as preparing for college is as follows: Table 
VI, preparing for classical course, 8,195; for scientifie course, 4,598; Table VII, pre- 
paring for classical course, 4,513; for scientific course, 2,020; or a total of 19,326. 
The number who have entered college since the close of the last academic year is from 
schools in Table VI, 2,358;, Table VII, 991. Entered scientific schools, Table VI, 818; 
Table VII, 300; total, 4,467. By reference to my last report it will be seen that the 
number of pupils preparing in the schools of Tables VI and VII for the college classi- 
calor scientific courses was 15,858, 28 per cent. of whom it appears have since entered. 
The number reported this year as making similar preparation in the schools of Tables 
VI and VII is 19,326. There are in addition 17,007 pupils making such preparation in 
the preparatory departments of universities, colleges, and schools of science. 
The general statistical summary of pupils receiving secondary instruction includes 
all the schools engaged in the work, excepting free high schools outside of cities con- 
taining 7,500 inhabitants and over. The total number of such pupils is given as 
271,215, or 1 in every 184 of the inhabitants (census of 1880). This proportion would 
be considerably increased if the enrolment in all free high schools were included. 
It must, however, be remembered that the free high schools other thai those pre- 
sented in the city table are not as a rule of as high grade as the schools included in 
the statistical summary here considered. The reports of the rural high schools from 
year to year are quite incomplete. So faras they are attainable they are summarized 
briefly under the head of Secondary Instruction in the abstracts of the report. 
The department of secondary instruction in our country offers much cause for criti- 
cism and much room for improvement, but the condition in this respect is far from 
upiform throughout the different sections. A large part of the country, it must be 
remembered, is not sufficiently advanced in population and wealth to support sec- 
ondary schools of a high order distinct from the elementary schools on the one side 
and degree conferring institutions on the other. In the States that take the lead in 
population and material resources, provision for secondary instruction is most com- 
plete and the courses of instruction appropriate for its different purposes are more or 
Jess specialized. There are, it need hardly be said, great differences of opinion'‘and no

  CXXXII_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
little confusion of mind as to the courses of study, methods of instruction, and stand- 
ards of attainment by which these different purposes may be best accomplished. 
It is evident that so far as secondary schools are feeders for higher institutions, 
whether classical or scientific, their studies and standards must be regulated by this 
relation. This fact is sufficiently recognized among us, and the persons whose busi- 
ness it is to see that the secondary and superior institutions are properly codrdinated 
seem to be fully alive to the present necessities of the case. Several measures have 
been recently adopted for the furtherance of this end. Among these are the policy 
of admitting to certain colleges and State universities graduates of accredited high 
schools and academies without examination and the agreement on the part of a num- 
ber of eastern colleges as to admission requirements and a common standard of exam- 
ination. These measures have been explained in previous reports. The experience 
of several higher schools of science as to the results of the preliminary training of 
their pupils has helped to a better understanding of what that preliminary training 
should be and has led to better provision for the same. 4 
It is with respect to that large class of pupils whose school education ends with 
the setondary grade that the outlook is most unsatisfactory. Courses of study offered 
to such pupils have not been carefully planned, and they have little of the stimulus 
that is supplied by judicious examinations and definite expectations, as represented 
by diplomas and other testimonials of work accomplished. 
A glance at Tables VI and VII will make it clear also to any candid observer that 
the money invested in secondary schools is totally incommensurate with the work to 
be accomplished. 
Formerly the conferences of the principals of secondary schools and others inter- 
ested in their conduct had almost exclusive reference to the relation of secondary to 
superior schools. Lately the conferences and published discussions have taken a 
wider range, comprehending the varied relations of the schools to the probable des- 
tiny of the pupils and to the requirements of the time. This is particularly notice- 
able in the discussions of high schools, their functions, standards, &c. The critical 
scrutiny to which the public high schools are subjected reacts in their favor by 
giving them the most powerful motive for keeping up to the full measure of exist- 
ing requirements. In respect to the adjustment of studies to pupils who are not 
likely to pass on to the colleges or schools of science, public schools can take much 
more prompt and decided action than private schools and they are more likely to be 
able to incur the expense of making adequate provision for instruction in science. 
In both of these directions the high schools are doing much more than is generally 
recognized for the advancement of secondary instruction among us. I hope very 
soon to be able to contribute to a better understanding of this matter by a presenta- 
tion of facts much more full and detailed than is possiblein my annual report. I 
cannot dismiss the subject without some reference to foreign systems and to certain 
recent utferances in other countries upon the problems which we also have to solve. 
The triple division of secondary instruction is recognized in Germany by the Gym- 
nasien, Realschulen, and middle schools. In my previous reports the two former 
have been very fully described as regards their divisions, curricula, &c. The middle 
schools are intended for children whose parents can afford to give them a somewhat 
better education than is usually obtained in common elementary schools. 
A large middle school usually consists of eight classes, and if the system of parallel 
classes has been adopted each of these is again subdivided into two sections. The 
number of pupils in each class does not often exceed 50 and is seldom under 30. There 
is always a fairly complete set of apparatus for teaching drawing and physical sci- 
ence, a8 well as an abundant supply of specimens of all kinds for illustrating lessons 
on botany, zodlogy, and mineralogy. The curriculum is nearly the same as in the 
second class Realschulen, excepting that only one foreign language is taught, and as _ 
the pupils generally leave at about 14 or 15 years of age the course is less complete.

    SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. CXXXIII 
i , 
At the international conference on education held in London, Dr. Bosscha, di- 
rector of the Polytechnic School at Delft, described in detail the constitution and 
working of the hoogere burgerscholen of Holland. They are, according to his state- 
ment, schools destined for boys of 12 to 17 or 18 years of age, and offer courses parallel 
to those of the Gymnasien, in which boys of the same age are prepared for the uni- 
versities. The schools are of two classes, one having a 5 and one a3 year course. 
Says Dr. Bosscha: 
It is easy to understand that the opening of a new direction in education to that of 
the Gymnasien caused the number of scholars of the latter to diminish. Indeed, for- 
merly many were sent to the Gymnasien because there was no other suitable way of 
giving a really developing education to boys of 12 or 13 yearsof age. This may have 
contributed considerably to give existence to the prejudice that no education of im- 
portance could be obtained without the study of Greek and Latin. This supposition 
was indeed true so long as there were, above the elementary schools, no other proper 
schools than the Latin schools. Till 1863 it was true in the Netherlands, but had to 
be given up when the hoogere burgerscholen had been established. 
‘The peculiar circumstances in which, after the said period, university education 
found itself during some years have codperated to give a positive proof that the knowl- 
edge and development which is necessary for successful university studies can be ob- 
tained without the so-called classical education, e. g., without Latin and Greek; for 
in 1863 the stipulation was still in force that young men who had not studied at a 
gymnasium would be admitted to the university only if they could pass an examina- 
tion for their admission before a committee of examiners from the literary faculty at 
every university. As may easily be understood this examination had, through the 
coéperation of different influences, in reality become so easy that a cursory study.of 
a few months was sufficient to acquire so many Latin and Greek words as were neces- 
sary to be admitted to the university. 
The consequence was that many young men who were attracted by the thorough 
instruction in the natural sciences which was given at the hoogere burgerscholen to 
the study of natural philosophy or medicine after having left the hoogere burger- 
scholen found admission to the university, where they entered upon their studies with 
avery slight knowledge of the ancient languages, but thoroughly prepared for their 
own profession, with nothing that bore reseniblance to a classical education, but with 
much that had been derived from the present standpoint of science and of real life. 
Examinations and curricula were prominent topics before the conference. The 
need of the former was universally admitted, but there were differences of opinion as 
to the sources from which they should proceed and various other details. The con- 
cluding words of an address upon this subject by Mr. J. G. Fitch, Her Majesty’s in- 
spector of schools, expressed a view of the scope of these test exercises that was gen- 
erally approved: i 
We are likely soon to make a distinct advance towards that organization of second- 
ary education in England which has long been so earnestly desired by the wisest of 
our statesmen and teachers. The endowed schools, though they do not cover the 
whole, or nearly the whole, of the ground, have in their control a substantial part of 
the secondary and higher education of the country. It will bea great gainif all these 
institutions are brought definitely within the scope of public supervision, and that 
the public should learn periodically what they are doing as well as what they were 
meant to do. 
But from one danger it is to be expected that we may keep free. There will, we 
may anticipate, be no aim at uniformity, no course of instruction prescribed by author- 
ity, and no standards. All these things are, to some extent, necessary in the case of 
the primary schools, because they receive a grant. When public money has to be 
distributed it becomes essential to lay down very definite conditions: to require at 
any rate a minimum of attainment in certain subjects which are universally regarded 
as indispensable and to mark out with some precision the character of the require- 
ments in regard to those subjects and parts of the school work in which liberty of 
choice is permitted. But in the secondary schools there is no grant to be awarded 
and no necessity for laying down any course or official ideal whatever. It is impos- 
sible, of course, to forecast the view which the newly constituted public department 
will take of its duties to the endowed schools; but it may be conjectured that its 
attitude will be that of an inquirez, a helper, a reporter, an interviewer, if you 
please, rather than that of a master. It may suffice to say to each endowed school 
in turn: ‘‘ What is it you propose to do? What are your own plans? What is your 
ideal? Now show us how you seek to realize it and what you have done; or, if your 
school has been examined by the university or other public authorities, let us see    
their report.” After all, what the public wants is to know the facts, not to impose’

CXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, * 
upon schools any scheme or theory of instruction of its own. The greater variety we 
can have in the types of schools, the larger the number of able and enthusiastic men 
and women whom we can contrive to leave free to carry out their own theories, and 
even to try new experiments in education, the better for the community. 
Here, then, we have the problem before us, how to give parents authentic 
knowledge of what schools are doing and perfect guarantees of efficiency, and at 
the same time to leave to teachers and to governing bodies that large freedom, that 
sense of independence and of responsibility, and that encouragement to spontaneous 
effort which have long characterized English schools, and which are so indispensable 
to the maintenance of all that is best in the national character. We want, in short, 
to make this great modern instrument of examinations a useful servant and not an 
imperious master, 
The two main points urged by Mr. Fitch, namely, the need of such supervision of 
all secondary schools as shall enable the public to judge of what they are doing and 
what they are meant to do and the maintenance at the same time of the “liberty of 
teaching,” are equally desirable for our country; consequently the efforts that are 
being put forth in England for the accomplishment of these purposes will be followed 
with the deepest interest in-the United States,

From the above table it will be seen that about 9 per cent. of the population of the 
United States have a direct interest in the provision for superior and professional in- 
struction on account of the vocation they follow. Moreover, these vocations are, for 
the most part, such as deeply affect the public welfare, so that the table suggests even 
to those not likely to participate in the superior training themselves reasons for their

personal concern in its adequate provision and efficient conduct. Liberal culture, it is 
true, should not be viewed with sole or supreme reference to its use in particular call- 
ings. It serves a nobler end as an instrument for the discipline and development of 
the highest powers of mankind; nevertheless, the history of institutions shows that 
provision for instruction and training of a high order bears, first or last, intimate re- 
lation to the service which it enables men to perform; hence in the demand for such 
service and the agencies for supplying the demand we have a certain criterion of the 
intellectual status of a people. 
The varied origin, character, sources of support, &c., of the schools in the United 
States professedly engaged in the work specified make it impossible to treat of them 
collectively. Before passing to their consideration in the separate classes to which 
they belong or in which they report themselves, it may be well to bring into gen- 
eral view certain particulars concerning them. 
Tables VIL, IX, and X relate to schools engaged exclusively or partly in the work 
of superior instruction. Table III, which for obvious reasons is placed with other 
tables of the public school system, and Tables XI, XII, and XIII relate to schools en- 
gaged in the work of specified training for pursuits in which learning and intellectual 
discipline are universally required. 
The total number of students reported in 1884 in the schools of the first group is 
110,878. Of these, 66,437 are in the departments for superior instruction, i. e., colle- 
giate or scientific. The sex of the students is not reported in all cases; so far as 
known, the number last stated includes 25,022 women, The number of students in 
the second group of schools, omitting Table III, is 23,276. Adding to this the num- 
ber reported in Table III as in training for teacherships,' viz, 28,354, the total of 
students under special training for the professions specified becomes 61,630. 
In the first group of schools the number of degrees conferred in course in 1884, as 
shown in Table XV, was as follows: In classical and scientific colleges, 6,820; in eae 
leges for women, 844; or, a total of 7,664. 
The number of graduates from the second group of schools in 1884 was 10,368, of 
whom 4,144, or 40 per cent., are reported in Table III. To sum up, so far as reported 
to this Office, the total of persons in courses of superior and special training in 1884 
was 128,067 and the total of. graduates from the same was 18,032, 
The number of students who before entering the professional schools received de- 
grees in letters or science was 2,729, distributed among the schools as follows: 
Schools of theology, 1,095, or 20 per cent. of the whole number. Schools of law, 677, 
or 25 per cent. of the whole number. Medical and surgical schools, Table XIII: regu- 
lar, 774, or7 per cent. of the whole number of students; eclectic, 43, or 5 per cent. of 
the whole number; homeopathic, 67, or 5 per cent. of the whole; dental schools, 69, 
or 7 per cent. of the whole number; pharmaceutical schools, 4, or } of 1 per cent. of 
the whole. 
The present status of liberal and professional education in our country will be 
best understood by the tables and summaries pertaining to the several classes of in- 
stitutions.

Table VIII presents the statistics of 236 institutions for the superior instruction of 
women, having 2,989 instructors and 30,587 students. Five colleges for women? in 
New York State which, on account of their relation to the University of New York, 
are included in Table IX, report 894 students; coeducation universities or colleges, 
Table IX, report in preparatory departments 8,161 female students, in classical courses 
2,009, and in scientific courses 1,196; coeducation colleges and schools of science, 
Table X, report in preparatory departments 460 female students — making the total 
number of women reported in institutions for ae instruction 43,307 as against 
40,407 reported in 1882~83. Of the whole number, 18,196 are reported in preparatory 
‘departments and 19,916 in collegiate, special, and graduate courses, the classification 
of the remainder not being specified. It will be observed that no statement is given 
of the number of female students in the schools of Table X in other departments than 
the preparatory. 
The property valuation for the schools of Table VIII is, as far as reported, $9,938,591. 
The amount of productive funds is $1,211,665, and the income from the same, $56,248. 
Tuition fees, which are the chief sources of income, pate for the year, so far as 
reported, to $926,248. 
The number of the institutions reported authorized u law to confer collegiate de- 
grees is 152, The number of degrees conferred in 1884 was 844, or 60 less than the num- 
ber reported in 1882-83. 
Every year slfows a slight increase in the number of young women pursuing supe- 
rior courses of study, a due proportion of this increase being in the leading coeduca- 
tion colleges and in the colleges for women that maintain the highest standards. For 
example, Boston University reported in 188081 108 women students out of a total of 
507; in 1883~84 the number of women reported is 154 eae of a total attendance of 614. 
The attendance of women students at Michigan Uni versity for the corresponding 
years was as follows,” the figures in parentheses being for 1880-’81: Departments of 
literature, science, and the arts, 118 (81); department of medicine and surgery, 40 
(43); law department, 1 (1); school of pharmacy, 2 (2); homeopathic medical col- 
lege, 11 (8); college of dental surgery, 5 (3); total, 177 (138). 
Harvard Annex had 27 pupils the first year of its existence, 1879, and 50 in 1884. 
Cornell University * had 60 women students in 1880-’81 and 49 in 1883~'84, 
The attendance at Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley Coeecs for the corresponding 
1 The colleges are Wells, Elmira Female, Rubee Female, and Vassar, and Ingham University. 
2 The figures for 1883-'84 have been made up from the catalogue of students, the sex being inferred 
from the name. The inference is possibly not correct in every case.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. CXXXIX 
years was as follows, the figures in parentheses being for 1880-81: Vassar, preparatory 
department, 63 (69); collegiate, spécial, and art courses, 287 (215); Wellesley, 515 
(872) ; Smith, 296 (254). The total attendance of women at the schools specified was 
then, by these showings, 1,243 in 1880~81 and 1,541 in 188384. On the whole, how- 
ever, the increase in the number of women who compete for scholastic honors on the 
same basis as men is not rapid enough to threaten any disturbance of existing social, 
domestic, or business relations. 
Since the date of my last report, women have been admitted to Middlebury College, 
Connecticut; to Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa.; and to the medical department of 
Columbian University, Washington, D.C. The Corcoran School of Science, one of 
the several schools under the control of this university, admits women as walls as 
men. 
Bryn Mawr College, founded by the late Joseph W. Taylor, M. D., is to be Sas in 
the fall of 1885. The institution is intended to meet the wants of advanced students. 
Thus the course in mathematics presupposes preliminary training through trigonom- 
' etry; the courses in modern language, power to read fluently; and other courses, 
equal advancement. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announces in its catalogue for 1883~84 
that— 
At the request of the Woman’s Education Association of Boston and with its gen- 
erous codperation, special laboratories for the instruction of women were provided 
in 1876, the design being to afford facilities for the study of chemical analysis, indus- 
trial chemistry, mineralogy, and biology. Through the changes made during the 
past year, these and better opportunities for the higher education of women in scien- 
tific pursuits are now offered in the Kidder laboratories of chemistry and in the phys- 
ical, biological, and other laboratories; and the Margaret Cheney memorial reading 
room has been opened for the use of young women who may be students in the school. 
The names of 11 female students appear on its register, and the names of 25 on the 
register of the Lowell School of Practical Design, which is under the corporation of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but supported by the Lowell Institute. 
Two new enterprises having for their object the higher education of women have 
been announced since the beginning of ‘the year. The Methodist denomination pur- 
poses the establishment of a Methodist female seminary of high grade in Baltimore, 
and funds have been pledged and plans matured for the establishment of a college 
for women in the city of New York, a practical outcome of the agitation with refer- 
ence to the admission of women to Columbia College. In 1883, 6 women passed the 
examinations for admission to the classes and collegiate course arranged for women 
under the auspices of the college, and 3 presented themselves this year. Harvard 
Annex reports 50 students the present year and $70,000 subseribed toward the fund 
of $100,000 necessary to insure.its incorporation. The success achieved by certain of 
the graduates of Harvard Annex in work of a high order is one of the most encour- 
aging facts in connection with the higher education of women. 
At the present there seems to be more need of increased funds and resources for ‘the 
existing institutions of the class under consideration than of new institutions. No 
record of the agencies for promoting the higher education of women would be com- 
plete without reference to the societies that have this object in view. 
HARVARD EXAMINATIONS FOR WOMEN. 
The Woman’s Education Association has been actively engaged in the work for 
12 years. One of the first measures proposed by it was the Harvard examinations 
for women, with reference to which the association submits the following in the re- 
port for 1884 : 
On account of the lessening number of candidates, never so large as in 1879, your 
committee had been gradually approaching a conviction that the experiment of the 
Harvard examinations for women had been fairly tried and that other agencies were 
now doing the work proposed. ‘The answers to the questions sent out by the com- 
mittee strengthened this conviction, and led them in December, 1882, to report to the 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  { 
CXL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
, 
association that “in the judgment of the committee the time has now come when the 
subject of discontinuing the examinations should be brought before the ciation. 
The committee are unanimously of the opinion that, while those girls preparing to 
take the first half of the examination in 1883 and the second half in 1884 should by 
no means be disappointed, it will be best to hold no examination later than 1884, 
“The reasons for this conclusion are these: There are now many opportunities for 
the higher education of girls which did not exist when we asked Harvard University 
to give these examinations: Smith College, Wellesley College, Boston University, and 
the course of collegiate study at Cambridge—the Annex—have all been opened 
since that time in our State, while at Vassar and Cornell ‘and at Michigan State 
University an increasing number of girls take advantage of the opportunities pro- 
vided for them. It isevident that ents and teachers prefer that girls shall be pre- 
pared for colleges where studies may be continued rather than that they shall be pre- 
pared for an examination which, although valuable as a test of thoroughness, opens 
no new opportunities, 
“The increase of girls’ colleges has raised the standard of education for girls in the 
high schools. In most of the] Jarge towns the high schools have alw; “prepared a 
few boys for colleges, and they give now the same 6 opportunitie tothe g By this 
means, a stimulus “has been given to the higher education of girls throughout New 
England. All the girls of the high schools ‘became familiar with a higher standard 
of education and that presented by the Harvard examinations is less needed. 
“Tt is evident that this system of examinations has not taken root ainong us, and 
that it is now rendered unnecessary by the establishment of the girls’ colleges, which 
have rapidly gained in public favor. It is certain, however, that the examinations 
have done much to promote an interest in the higher education of women, and have 
thus furthered the end for which they were established.” 
The association accepted this report and appointed the committee on the examina- 
tions a special committee to communicate to the dean of the college faculty that, in 
the judgment of the association, the general interest in the examinations would hot 
justify our support of them after 1884, 
The New York committee objected to this action and petitioned the faculty to con- 
tinue the examinations after 1484 and to advertise them. 
The Cincinnati committee joined the New York committee, while the Philadelphia 
ladies resolved to join in the action of the committee of the association, who, how- 
ever,on account of the remonstrance of the New York committee and other impor- 
tant considerations, voted ‘to inform the association that they might need a longer 
time than that at first proposed for terminating their connection with the examina- 
tions.” 
: In closing the report for 1883, the committee would add that, since the extended 
_ advertisement of the examinations by means of these questions has not resulted in 
any increase in the number of candidates, they will not probably ask for a postpone- 
ment of the time at first proposed for closing our connection with the examinations, 
i.e., the summer of 1884. 
A full consideration of the influence of the examinations and of their failure to 
excite a permanent interest in our community will belong to the time when the com- 
mittee shall have finished their work; but they do not wish to postpone until then 
all expression of gratitude for the fidelity, patience, and kindness with which the 
members of the university concerned in the experiment have performed their part of 
the work.    
     
    
        ASSOCIATIONS DEVOTED TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 
  The Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York was 
organized in 1882. Its avowed object is to secure the admission of women to Colum- 
bia College. It also endeavors to raise the standard of instruction in existing schools 
for girls, 
The Association of Collegiate Alumne is giving special attention to the subject of 
physical education for women. A circular of inquiry was prepared and issued by 
them for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of college education upon the health 
of women students. After 462 of the circulars had been answered the committee 
published a report stating that the members fully believe that a college education is 
physically beneficial and ‘that college statistics show an average of health among 
women students higher than among women at large; but they also realize that the 
physical status of American women of the educated class is painfully low, and they 
believe that the colleges ought to be among the first to take measures against this 
dangerous deterioration of physique.” The report also gave a schedule showing how 
fragmentary had been the work done in this direction by the colleges represented in
-P-A-G-E-141

the association, and added a series of suggestions addressed first to parents, secondly 
to governing bodies of institutions which grant degrees to women, and thirdly to 
women students. 
This was not the extent of the results effected. The permanent value of the inves- 
tigation has been publicly recognized. The Massachusetts State board of statistics, 
considering the research important to the public welfare, has made a voluntary prop- 
osition through its chairman to employ the time of six clerks for three months to 
the end of collating and arranging these statistics in the best possible form. 
In 1883 the Western Association of Collegiate Alumne was founded and has already 
entered upon practical work in several important directions. 
The Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women continues its 
excellent work of giving encouragement, sympathy, and direct pecuniary help to 
women who, against great obstacles, are seeking to make use of opportunities for 
advanced study. One of the most important features of its work is the Loan Library, 
which secures the use of text books to such students as need help in this way. The 
society lends its hearty codperation to measures for improving the living conditions 
of women students and for promoting their physical training. 
COEDUCATION, 
The action of the faculty of Adelbert College of Western Reserve University with 
reference to the continued admission of women excited much feeling, but happily 
has not resulted to the disadvantage of the women. 
At a meeting of the faculty held June 9, 1884, ‘‘ it was voted that the trustees be in- 
formed that the faculty are of the opinion that after the autumn examinations of 1886 
young women should not be admitted to coeducation in this college.” 
This vote was approved by all the members of the faculty except the president, who 
was absent from the meeting and did not know that any such action was contem- 
plated. This minute was transmitted to the board of trustees at their meeting, June 
18. The board appointed a committee to examine the question and directed that they 
report to the board at a special meeting to be held November 7. This committee, 
consisting of Hon. W. I. Chamberlain, Mr. Joseph Perkins, Hon. 8. E. Williamson, 
Mr. Samuel Andrews, Mr. L. E. Holden, Mr. W. H. Doan, and Rev. Carroll Cutler, 
proceeded to seek information from a very large number of those presidents and pro- 
fessors of colleges and other high schools of learning who had had experience in the 
joint education of men and women, and from a considerable number of those who 
had had no experience, but who were thought best able to present the arguments 
against it. 
The committee met first on September 15 to consider the subject and compare the 
testimony which they had received, and again on November 6 to determine ona 
report to be made to the board. The majority of the committee, consisting of Mr. 
Chamberlain, Mr. Perkins, Mr. Doan, and Mr. Cutler, agreed to a report concluding 
as follows: “In view of such and such like facts and opinions, your committee beg 
leave to recommend that the action urged by the faculty, viz, ‘To refuse, after the 
autumn examinations of 1886, to admit young women to coeducation in Adelbert 
College,’ be not adopted by this board of trustees.” Mr. Williamson and Mr. Andrews 
presented a minority report urging that no women be hereafter admitted to Adelbert 
College. Mr. Holden was absent, but concurred in the views of the majority. At 
the meeting of the board of trustees on November 7 the recommendation of the ma- 
jority report was adopted by the board, after a long and thorough discussion of the 
entire subject, by a vote of 12 ayes to 6 noes, 1 member not voting. . 
At this meeting a paper was submitted by the president of the faculty, Carroll Cut- 
ler, containing an exhaustive review of the results of coeducation in the colleges in 
which it has had adequate trial, as also a candid statement of the arguments ad- 
vanced against the system. In conclusion Mr. Cutler says: 
Joint education of men and women in the higher studies has now been tried in a 
sufficient number and variety of colleges and for a sufficient length of time to prove 
 
-P-A-G-E-142

CXLIt REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
‘that no special difficulties and evils grow out of it and that it does away with the 
greatest difficulties and evils of the old monastic system. It makes college life and 
society more nearly human, instead of ‘‘only half human.” The half human ever 
verges first and last towards the bestial, whether in armies, on shipboard, in miners’ 
camps, or in colleges, monasteries, and nunneries. It would be wise to humanize the 
colleges still more, rather than to begin the process of dehumanizing them}; better to 
follow the example of the churches, and get in the fathers and mothers as well as the 
brothers and sisters. This we do to some extent, and to our great benefit too, when 
cultivated ladies and gentlemen, fathers and mothers, attend our popular courses of 
lectures. They bring a moral blessing with them and carry a mental one away. It 
isa good exchange for us; and well would it be for the college if it were oftener and 
more systematicaliy made. : 
The situation of this college is specially favorable to the joint education of men 
and women. It is within reach of many cultivated and christian homes, in which 
both classes of students can live amid the best of influences. All the natural, social, 
and christian surroundings of the college harmonize with it and help it. All the 
schools, except one or two, from which we can hope to receive pupils are frequented 
by boys and girls alike. Our own two academies are mixed'schools and prepare boys 
and girls for college. Our medical college and the other medical colleges of the city 
admit women to all their instructions, examinations, and degrees. ‘All experience 
westof the Alleghany Mountains shows that this true method of nature is also the 
fitting thing in the view of the people. There is scarcely a college in all this central 
and western region which can be called in any sense prosperous which does not adopt 
it. Many even of those colleges which were founded and carried ‘on for many years 
on the monastic principle have adopted it partly in self defence, because they saw 
that it was demanded and they would lose patronage without it, This college can- 
not prosper by discarding and antagonizing the advanced and advancing thought and 
feeling of the world about it, by falling back upon medieval notions and methods. 
It seems to be hoped by some that, if women could only be turned out from this col- 
lege or put off with the heel-taps and broken meats of knowledge after the men have 
been intellectually dined, some one will have pity on them and come to the rescue 
with an endowment of acollege for them. To place a separate college for women here 
in as good condition as this college now is, for their education in the same classes 
with men, would require at least $800,000 ; and then with a capital of $1,606,000 we 
should be doing the same work over twice, and, on neo of the evil and mistaken 
monastic system on both sides, be getting out of it results, for men and women both, 
which would be far inferior both intellectually and morally. To add $400,000 to the 
funds of this college as it now is would, if wisely managed, more than double the ad- 
vantages which both parties would then have in courses, instructors, apparatus, and 
books, and, besides, give afar higher, more natural and human tone intellectually and 
morally to all our work. A policy of separation is poor financial economy and mor- 
ally poorer still. 
Tam of the opinion that women ought, hereafter as heretofore, to be admitted to 
this college and to have every privilege it can afford — 
(1) Because all the reasons assigned for closing the doors to women are either such 
as are practically irrelevant to the subject or such as every touch of experience 
proves to be groundless. \ 
(2) Because their presence elevates the scholarship. 
(3) Because it elevates the moral tone of college life, improves the order, and tends 
to banish coarseness and rudeness. . 
(4) Because, while itis true that there are comparatively few women who d a 
full college education, those few ought to be cheerfully and cordially encouraged in it 
and helped to it by all who are interested in the progress of God’s kingdom, since the 
fields of labor now opened to them and forced upon them are so important, so fruit- 
ful, and need such high qualifications. 1 
(5) Because this college was founded especially for Christ and His church, and 
ought to do all it can, and in all the ways which Providence opens as the times ad- 
vance, to meet the needs of the church and serve the Head of the church. 
(6) Because our two academies are open to girls as well as boys, to their great ad- 
vantage, and our medical college also admits women. To refuse them the advantages 
of the college would be causelessly to destroy the harmony of the system and would 
cast a reflection both upon the academies and the medical college. 
(7) Because the €xclusion of women will disaffect and repel from the college all those 
high schools, academies, and preparatory schools, of every name, which teach and 
prepare for the college courses both boys and girls. We cast a reflection upon their 
system, and no argument can ever disabuse their minds of an idea which our public 
aetion and our daily practice enforce uponthem. We cannot afford to say to all these 
schools in Ohio and elsewhere that we consider one-third or one-half of their pupils 
unfit candidates for the privileges of this college, however high their character or 
scholarship. We cannot make this invidious distinction without throwing cold water

on the interest and enthusiasm of those pupils who might otherwise come to us from 
these schools, and upon those teachers who have as great hopes of the one class of 
their pupils as of the other and as great interest in them, 
(8) Because, if we exclude women, we thus make it so much less worth while for 
all these schools to hold up their courses to the studies and the standard of require- 
ment for admission to college. We shall thus certainly destroy our connection and 
disorganize the system on whick we must depend for prosperity. The people will not 
endure to see a public and offensive rejection of a considerable part of those who de- 
sire college education, and will inevitably say: ‘* Henceforth we cut all connection 
with you. You go your way; we will go ours.” 
(9) Because the public can never be made to believe that a college with so large an 
endowment and so small an attendance can have any valid justification for thus to- 
tally and gratuitously warning off one-half the human race. They will laugh sucha 
transaction to scorn. This public, on which the college is dependent for success, has 
a strong sense of justice and a long memory for injustice. 
(10) Because a long and very varied experience of many colleges and other institu- 
tions of every grade testifies on every hand that the results of the joint education.of 
men and women are good, and only good, for both men and women. 
(11) Because economy requires it. 
(12) Because the policy of the college asa public trust for the public good ought to 
be to broaden its sympathies and take hold of ever wider circles of public sympathy, 
in order that it may do an ever increasing amount of good. 
(13) Because the honor of our founders and donors will be compromised by any nar- 
rowing policy. They live in the honor and reverence of men in proportion as the 
college draws toward it all classes of the people by its work for their good and its 
liberal principles. 1 
(14) Because the college has burdens enough to bear already, some from the remote 
and some from the recent past. The shock it has already received from the mere pro- 
osal to do this unjust thing we are now met to consider, it will not soon recover 
rom. 
HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN ABROAD, 
The most important provision for the higher education of women of which informa- 
tion has been received since the date of my last report has been made in Canada. 
The corporation of McGill University, Montreal, has had the subject under con- 
sideration since the establishment of the McGill Normal School in 1857. In 1870, 
when the university appealed to its friends for additional endowment, the Rey. Dr. 
Wilkes moved a resolution to the efiect that the university should as early as possi- 
ble extend its benefits to women. This resolution was unanimously adopted, but the 
means for carrying it into effect were not immediately forthcoming. In 1883 Princi- 
pal Sir J. William Dawson, c. M. G., LL. D., visited Great Britain for the purpose of 
studying in detail the methods in operation in that country and reporting upon the 
same. On his return he found that 8 young women, who had passed as associates in 
arts, were prepared to proceed at least as far as the examinations for senior associate 
and were desirous that the university should aid them in their studies. The finan- 
cial difficulty in the way of meeting this practical demand was removed by the gift 
of Hon. Donald A. Smith, who placed $50,000 at the disposal of the university, to 
be invested for the endowment of a college and classes for women.' Under this en- 
dowment the classes have been commenced for women a the first and second years 
of the college course under special regulations. The course of study and the exami-~ 
nations are the same as for men, except that women are allowed to take German as 
equivalent to Greek, Although no actual provision has been made for the third and 
fourth years as yet, it is understood that the present students, about 15 in number, 
are to proceed to graduation. 
The following universities in Canada admit women to lectures in the same classes 
as men: Victoria, at Coburg; Queen’s, at Kingston; Dalhousie, at Halifax; and Uni- 
versity College, at Toronto. The last named was opened to women for the first time 
in 1884, and tle action was regarded as a signal triumph for the cause of women’s 
education, as the college is a state institution and the applications of the women 
had to be dealt with as a matter of public policy. It is noticeable that in Canada,

CXLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
as in Great Britain and the United States, the higher education of women received 
its chief impulse from the work and the requirements of women teachers. In On- 
tario women are allowed to teach in high schools as assistants, but they cannot be- 
come head teachers without taking a degree in arts. Hence the opportunity of secur- 
ing a degree is of great practical importance to those who are ambitious to secure 
promotion in the teaching profession. Several women are now in their fourth year 
in the University College, all of whom will probably take their degree of B. A. in the 
coming year. i 
My last annual report contained a very full summary of the state of higher education 
for women in Europe. Since that date women have been admitted to certain of the 
honor examinations of Oxford University, the statute to that effect having been passed 
by tlie convocation of the university April 29, 1834. 
University College, Liverpool, one of the youngest though most vigorous local col- 
Jeges, has been admitted to a place in Victoria University. This puts a medical 
degree within the reach of residents in Liverpool and neighborhood without the ex- 
pense of going to Glasgow or Edinburgh for the completion of their medical training. 
As part of the Victoria University the college is now able to confer on women trained 
within its walls the same degrees as those open to men, 
The report of the first session of the department for women, Owens College, Man- 
chester, is encouraging. The total number of registered students is 60, and the 
attendance and work have been highly satisfactory. A series of scholarships has 
been founded, the value of each being 201. per annum, tenable for three years. ‘Two 
such scholarships will be offered in July for competition among the pupils of the 
Manchester High School for Girls, and two for open competition at the end of Sep- 
tember or the beginning of October next. t 
The council has not so far thrown open any of the college scholarships for compe- 
tition among the students in the department for women. By the generosity, how- 
ever, of a governor of the college, Mr. Thomas Ashton, the council is enabled to offer 
for competition among duly qualified students in that department in October next 
an extra Victoria scholarship (in classics). The value of the scholarship will be the 
same as that of the ordinary scholarship, 401. per annum for two years; the examina- 
tion will be in the same papers; the standard to be reached will be the same; and 
the conditions of competition and tenure will be identical, or as nearly so as the nat- 
ure of the case will allow. | 
The degree of doctor in mental and moral science at London University has been 
won by a woman, who thus becomes D. sc. 
The following statement is from a paper on the ‘“ University education of women,” 
by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, read before the recent International Conference on Educa- 
tion, London: 
Without counting those who have this year completed their university course, about 
392 students have been sent out into the world from Newnham and Girton,! of whom 
127 passed honor examinations, and during the last academic year there have been 
between the two colleges 146 students in residence. If we inquire about the subse- 
quent history of these 392 students, we find that about 205 are in different ways en- 
raged in teaching (including 5 who are married), 3 are preparing for the medical pro- 
fession, 11 have employments of other kinds, 2 have gone into sisterhoods, about 47 
have married or are on the point of doing so, 102 others are living at home without 
(so far as we know) being engaged in earning their living, 9 (including 2 married 
ones) have died, and there are about 20 respecting whom I have failed to obtain in- 
~ formation. | 
From these statistics it appears that the majority of students have heen pre- 
paring for professional work, chiefly the work of teaching. 1t would be a mistake 
to suppose, however, that they come exclusively from the class which supplied female 
  
1The following statistics of students in Girton College are from the college report for 1884 : 
The number of students who have been in residence in the college since its commencement is 181. 
Of these, 80 have obtained honors according to the Cambridge University standard (28 in classics, 22 in 
mathematics, 1 in mathematics and in moral sciences, 1 in mathematics and in history, 14 in 
natural sciences, ! in natural sciences and in moral sciences, 7 in moral sciences, 5 in history, and 1 in 
theology) and 25 have passed examinations qualifying for the ordinary B. A. degree; 51 have not yet 
completed their course.

  teachers thirty years ago, because, during that period, this class has been consider- 
ably enlarged, partly from the increase of honorable and independent posts (duo 
in the teaching profession, mainly, to the increase in number and importance 
of high schools for girls), but still more from the steadily growing feeling among the 
daughters of professional men that they ought to earn their own living. It would 
be interesting to try to ascertain the causes of this growing feeling ; perhaps one of 
them may be found in the diminution of necessary domestic worl, due to the in- 
creased manufacture on a large scale of articles of food and clothing, and to the in- 
vention of the sewing machine and other labor saving apparatus; but, however this 
may be, of the fact that more women seek serious work outside their homes than was 
formerly the case there can be no doubt. 
But though the professional class of students is in the majority there remains an 
important ciass who come from a disinterested love of knowledge and desire for intel- 
Jectual training. It is, I believe, the universal opinion of all who have watched the 
work at Cambridge that the intermixture of these two classes has been a gain to 
both, the presence of the one tending to foster the spirit of steady and concentrated 
work, and of the other to promote a greater interest in the subjects taught for their own 
sake. 
The cause of higher education for women has been materially advanced in Scotland 
through the opening of Queen Margaret College. This is a practical outcome of the 
efforts made by the Glasgow Association, although the funds for this particular insti- 
tution are due to the generosity and public spirit of one woman, Mrs. Elder. The 
senatus of the University of St. Andrews has received six petitions on the subject of 
university education of women, one of which was presented by the L. L. A.’s of the 
university. The petitioners ask two things: (1) They all ask for such a course of 
university education as the senatus may think fit to grant; (2) some of them ask for 
admission to degrees in arts. As to the first the senatus expresses its willingness to 
grant separate courses of systematic university instruction to women, provided a 
sufficient sum of money is raised by the petitioners (or others) to enable this to be 
done, especially as during the earlier stages of the experiment the attendance at 
the several classes might not be so large as to furnish adequate remuneration to the 
professors without such a fund. As to the second, the senatus resolves as follows: 
(1) That in the mean time, as an equivalent for graduation, women students be recom- 
mended to take the L. L. A. examination in all the subjects necessary for the M. 
A. degree, inasmuch as the examination papers used in the two cases are the same. 
(2) The senatus is further willing to urge upon Parliament the claims of women to 
the privileges of matriculation and graduation, and the existing interests of the uni- 
versity warrant such a step, and provided that every female student attending tho 
university shall lodge or board in some house in St. Andrews to be approved of by 
the senatus. 
- At the L. L. A. (literate in arts) examination of 1884 there were 319 passes, with as 
large proportion of honors. 
In his report upon the higher education of women, published after his visit to Eng- 
land, Principal Dawson, of McGill University, says: 
In Britain, as in this country, the question of separate or mixed education of the 
sexes has been much discussed ; but in this, as in other matters, the practical and free 
genius of the English people has set itself to work out the problem in real life, instead 
of debating it in a theoretical manner, and consequently we find anumber of experi- 
ments in progress. These may be classified under three heads: (1) Whatis sometimes 
called in this country ‘ coeducation,” or the education of both sexes in mixed classes; 
(2) separate education in colleges specially for women ; and (3) intermediate or eclec- 
tic methods, in which the two first are combined in various proportions. The coexist- 
ence of these different methods has the good effect of enabling parents and students 
to make a choice of systems and to avail themselves of that which they prefer, with- 
out establishing anything more than a friendly rivalry between the different kinds of 
institutions. : 
The method of mixed classes Principal Dawson found in successful operation in 
University College, London, and in University College, Bristol. As examples of edu- 
cation in separate colleges he instances Cheltenham, which has as many as 500 pupils 
and students; Bedford, North London, and Milton Mount Colleges; the King’s College

  classes, London; and Holloway College. The third method is that pursued at Girton 
and Newnham Colleges, Cambridge; Somerville and Lady Margaret Halls, Oxford ; the 
woman’s department of Owens College, Manchester; and the classes of the Edinburgh 
Ladies’ Educational Association. 
es second annual report of the Royal University of Ireland presents a gratifying 
view of the work of the women students. 
e number of women who have availed themselves of the opportunities presented 
e university has not been large, but of those who have passed. through the 
ersity examinations a considerable proportion have done so with marked dis- 
rea on. 
In the autumn of 1883 the matriculation examination was passed by 33 women, of 
whom 11, or one-third, obtained honors, some of them in more subjects than one, 
Twenty-three passed the first university examination in arts, 12 with honors, and, 
ofthe 9 women candidates who presented themselves at the second university exami- 
nation in arts, 5 obtained honors, almost all in more subjects than one. At this exam- 
ination a woman student obtained the first place in the honor list, both in logic and 
in biology, obtaining honors also in Latin ; another headed the honor list in English, 
while a third obtained the only honors given at the examination in music; and at 
aia xamination for the university scholarships, held last January, a woman student 
obtal ined the first place in the competition for the scholarships in modern literature. 
The higher education of women is steadily gaining groundinIndia, A high school 
for girls has recently been opened at Poona and numbers some 60 pupils. 
The array of facts which meets us thus from year to year with reference to new 
provision for the higher education of women or the good results from existing provi- 
sion is sufficient proof of the inestimable value of these provisions to the individual 
women who have or may enjoy them and of large benefits ensuing therefrom to so- 
ciety in general.

    The institutions reported in Table IX possess deep interest for those who seek to 
know the tendencies and to measure the progress of superior instruction in this coun- 
try. The record of any particular year differs but little from that of the preceding, 
but therecord of several years shows changes and movements that invite attention. 
OF the 370 universities and colleges represented in the table, 19 report only prepar- 
atory departments and 8 do not report students, leaving 343 whose work is very clearly 
exhibited. Among these are distributed 32,767 collegiate students. A general state- 
ment like this, however, conveys a very imperfect idea of the estimate placed upon 
college training in this country as indicated by college attendance, the possibilities 
and requirements of States in one section being so unlike those of another. A better 
idea of the distribution of college students will be formed by considering separately 
the sections into which the country may be conveniently divided. In 1880 the centre 
of population was at latitude 39° 4’ 8” N. and longitude 84° 39’ 40” W. of Greenwich. 
Ithas moved slightly westward in the intervening years, but we shall not be far out 
of the way in using the point designated. The whole country may be divided into 
four parts ranged around this centre. The States would then be grouped as follows: 
To the first or northeast section belong Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu- 
setts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Penn- 
sylvania, District of Columbia, Ohio, and Michigan.! To the second or southeast section 
belong Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Flor- 
ida. To the third or northwest section belong Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minne- 
sota, Iowa, Nebraska, Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and 
California. To the fourth or southwest section belong Kentucky, Tennessee, Ala- 
bama, Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New 
Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. 
The total population of the first section is 20,601,581 and the total number of 
students in college courses 15,300, or 1 to every 1,346 of the people. The population 
of the second section is 6,338,022 ; the number of students in college courses, 2,601, or 
a ratio of 1 to 2,436. The population of the third section is 10,571,768; the number 
of college students 7,462, or 1 to 1,417. The population of the fourth section is 
12,644,408; the number of college students 1,707, or aratio of 1to 7,404. The highest 
ratio is found, as we should expect, in the northeast section ; the lowest, in the south- 
east section. It istrue that the students in an individual college may not come alto- 
gether from the immediate vicinity of the college, but it is only three or four of the 
most noted institutions that control sufficient patronage outside of the sections in 
which their States fall to affect materially the ratios here given. 
The institutions brought together in the table have, with few exceptions, the follow- 
ing common characteristics: they are empowered by law to confer collegiate degrees, 
or at least the B. A.; they offer a more or less extensive course in the studies that by 
common consent are assigned to the colleges of liberal arts, and they have students in 
the same. 
Unchartered colleges or universities cannot confer degrees. Of such here tabulated, 
2have been recently organized and will probably secure charters before the students 
now matriculated are ready for graduation; besides these there are a few Roman 
Catholic colleges that maintain the usual college course as a means of preparing young 
men for a subsequent ecclesiastical course. 
One hundred and twenty-three of the institutions in the table are designated as 
universities. A few of these have a full university organization and large resources ; 
others are limited at present to one or more departments, but have assumed the title 
of university by virtue of authority conferred by their charters or otherwise, asa help’ 
to the largest possible development in the future; in other cases the name cannot 
be regarded as expressing either present scope or future possibilities, and its use is 
to be regretted. It will also be noticed that in a few instances the term college des- 
  
1States like Michigan, that are on both sides of the dividing line, are assigned to the section in 
” which the larger part of their population falls.

ignates a well endowed institution with cdllegiate and professional departments. 
These varying conditions make it desirable to view the institutions under considera- 
tion from some other standpoint than that of name or class. 
Three conditions present themselves as worthy of consideration: The number of 
college students, the number of professors, and the sources of revenue. An analysis 
of the table with reference to these conditions will aid us materially in forming a cor- 
rect conception of the provision that has been made among us for liberal education; 
With reference to students and professors it appears that, of the 370 universities 
and colleges tabulated, 35 do not report college students separately ; 226 report under 
100; 75 report from 100 to 200, and of these 62 report 8 or more college professors each ; 
19 report from 200 to 300, and of these 17 report 10 or more college professors ; 7 report 
from 300 to 400, with from 18 to 34 professors ; 4 report from 400 to 500, professors 16 
to 42; 2 report from 500 to 600, with faculties numbering 41 in one case and 33 in the 
other; 1 reports from 600 to 700, with a faculty of 41; and 1 reports above 700 college 
students, with a faculty of 58, 2 
It appears, then, that, as regards the students and professors, we have a number of ~ 
institutions prepared for vigorous work within, at least, the limits of the usual col- 
lege curriculum. A glance at the table will show that these are with few exceptions 
well housed. It remains to take some account of their financial strength. Three 
sources of income are set forth: tuition fees, productive funds, and State appropria- 
tion. The 35 institutions reporting receipts from the last source are nearly all State 
universities or colleges in which merely nominator no tuition fees are charged. The 
statistics of the remaining institutions indicate that tuition fees are not likely to 
decline with the increase of productive funds, the charges (not receipts) being as a 
rule largest where there are the largest endowments. Productive funds, as the most 
permanent and steady source of income, are most important to our present inquiry. 
With reference to these the table shows as follows: « 
(1) Seventy-five colleges or universities having from 100 to 200 students.— (a) 27 make 
no report under the head of productive funds! (6 of these did formerly report pro- 
ductive funds, and, of these, 4 in 1880 or more recently ; 4 receive annual State appro- 
priations; 22 have 8 or more professors); (b) 4 report none (all have 8 or more profes- 
sors); (¢) 5 report less than $50,000 (of these, 4 have 8 or more professors); (d) 12 re- 
port from $50,000 to $100,000 (of these, 8 have 8 or more professors); (e) 23 report 
from $100,000 to $500,000 (of these, 20 have 8 or more professors); (f) 4report above 
$500,000 (all have 8 or more professors). 
(2) Nineteen colleges or universities having from 200 to 300 students.— (a) 3 make no 
report under the head of productive funds; (b) 2 report less than $50,000; (c) 2 re- 
port from $50,000 to $100,000; (d) 4 report from $100,000 to $300,000; (e) 3 report 
from $300,000 to $500,000; (f) 3 report from $500,000 to $1,000,000; (g) 2 report above 
$1,000,000. 
(3) Fifteen colleges or universities having 300 or more students.— (a) 4 make no report 
under the head of productive funds; (b) 1 reports none; (¢) 3 report from $250,000 
to $500,000; (d) 3 report from $500,000 to $1,000,000; (e) 4 report above $1,000,000. 
The following are the universities or colleges (without regard to students) that re- 
port productive funds of $500,000 or more, with the amounts reported; against these 
are placed State appropriation and receipts from tuition fees when reported: 
  
1By reference to the table it will be seen that the fund reported from universities sometimes rep- 
resents the fund for all departments and sometimes only for the collegiate,

Investments differ so much in value that perhaps a better conception of the resources 
of our colleges may be formed by an examination of incomes other than the proceeds 
of tuition fees: Of colleges or universities reporting incomes from productive funds 
or State appropriations or both, 44 report them as ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 ; 
21, from $25,000 to $50,000; 5, from $50,000 to $100,000 ; 8, from $100,000 to $250,000, 
and 1, above $250,000, 
The facts pertaining to the financial affairs of our colleges and universities as here 
_ Set forth cannot be fully comprehended without reference to like conditions in other 
- countries. It is not easy to obtain the data, but statements have lately been pub- 
lished that throw some light on the subject. In a recent address, Sir Lyon Playfair 
stated that the 4 Scotch universities rely mainly upon the annual grant, amounting in 
all to 28,0001. ($136,262). He contrasted this meagre pilowance with the revenues of 
| A
-P-A-G-E-155
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. CLV 
the English universities, which had, he said, “through their colleges an income of 
nearly half a million pounds” ($2,433,250). 
In 1882-83 the total cost of the ten Prussian universities was in round numbers 
$1,900,000... Of this sum 9.3 per cent. was their own earnings from tuition fees, &e. ; 
the rest was the contribution of the state, 72 per cent. being ordinary and the balance 
extraordinary contributions (i. e., for building, &c.). 
Ten universities and colleges can be pointed out in this country whose combined in- 
come for 1884 amounted to $1,922,504. Of this, 19 per cent. was from tuition fees, 11 
per cent. from State appropriations, and the remainder, the income of permanent 
funds. It would not do to infer from these figures that liberal education is as well 
endowed in this country as in Prussia. Before any conclusions could be drawn, it 
would be necessary to bring into the comparison the expenditure for the Gymnasien. 
According to Dr. Conrad,! in 1882~83 the expenditure for Gymnasien, including Pro- 
gymnasien, was 16,022,502 Mark ($3,813,355.47). 
The sources from which the expenditures were met are given as follows: From 
fees, Gymnasien, including Progymnasien, 7,565,964 Mark ($1,800,699.43). From en- 
dowments: Gymnasien, 955,096 Mark ($227,312.84). From government and district 
funds and patrons’ additions: Gymnasien, including Progymnasien, 7,565,964 Mark 
($1,800,699.43). 
The expenditure for the Gymnasien, added to that for the universities, gives, in round 
numbers, $5,700,000, which should be compared, if comparisons are permissible, with 
the totalincome reported for the colleges and universities in Table IX, or $5,908,459. 
It should also be noticed that the entire number of institutions included in the state- 
ment for Prussia is 292, as against 370 in Table IX. 
On the whole, the view of our superior institutions presented by the statistics of 
students, professors, and finances is encouraging. Undoubtedly we have too many 
feeble colleges; too many that, judged by their work, are not above the grade of pre- 
paratory schools and not well furnished for even that position. The number of these 
weaklings does not, however, appear to be on the increase; there is reason to hope 
that we have passed the period of pretension, and that colleges which are only such 
in name will gradually abandon their false position, and that those that remain will 
become better and better prepared for their duties. 
These tendencies are very clearly seen in the record of a period of years, as set forth 
in the tables of my annual reports. 
Thus by a comparison of the statisties of 1875 with those of 1884 it appears that 
29 colleges or universities have been organized since the former date. Of these Johns 
Hopkins University has already taken an assured place among our leading institu- 
tions and Tulane University of Louisiana has in it promise of rapid growth and large 
influence. The remaining 27 institutions have come into the work without special 
observation or unusual advantages. 
Altogether these 29 institutions have added to the college resources of the country 
258 college instructors, a property valuation of $1,977,000, and productive funds (ex- 
clusive of the funds of Tulane University *) to the amount of $3,511,000, yielding in 
1884 an income of $257,960. For the current year 3,401 collegiate students werg 
profiting by these provisions. 
Increase in the number of colleges is desirable in a country whose population is 
increasing so rapidly as our own; but the fact that the largest additions to college - 
resources during the period considered have been made through the older colleges is

at Halle. 
2In 1884, by a contract with the State of Louisiana, the administrators of the Tulane educational: 
fund became the administrators of the University of Louisiana, agreeing to devote their income to its 
development and to establish thereon the Tulane University of Louisiana. Mr. Tulane’s original dona- 
tion yielded $35,000 per annum, which has been doubled by subsequent gifts from the same benefactor,

   ore gratifying. Tables IX, 1875 and 1834, afford some valuable information 
upon’this point. # 
It should be premised that Johns Hopkins University is to be found in both tables. 
productive funds alone having been reported in 1875. As the university did not enter 
upon the work of instruction until 1876, it is included in the 29 institutions previously 
mentioned. Omitting all universities and colleges not found in both tables, as well 
as Johns Hopkins, we have 299 with respect to which comparison may be made. 
These show increase as follows: In the number of college instructors, 188; college 
students, 5,093 ; property valuation, $2,586,746; productive funds, $17,312,939 ; income 
from productive funds, $482,999 ; State appropriations, $48,947. 
Of the 55 colleges tabulated in 1875 and not in 1884,a number have given up the 
endeavor to maintain the college standard, but are doing excellent work as prepara- 
tory “ee and are now included in Tables VI or VII. Others have modified their 
original purpose and courses of study and are now classed in Table III, X, or XI. 
About a third have suspended; others, from which no recent information has been 
received, are known to be struggling against adverse circumstances. 
On the other hand, of 70 colleges reported in 1884, but not in 1875, quite a number 
that were in a low condition at the earlier date are now strong and useful. It would 
be interesting to extend this examination of the college record, to note the fluctuations 
in attendance, the rise and fall in tuition fees and in the number and value of schol- 
arship funds, and, passing beyond the statistics, to inquire into the underlying condi- 
tions of which they are merely the index: to consider, for instance, what the increaso 
of faculties, or of the number of professors, or of funds may signify with respect to 
better organization, enlarged curricula or subdivision, and consequent improvement 
in the work of instruction. } 
But enough has been said to show that the statistics carefully compiled from year 
to year are valuable both for the facts which they record and the inquiries which they 
suggest ; fuller analysis must be deferred to a more favorable time, Meanwhile the 
consideration of movements that have been going on in pariicular colleges and uni- 
versities will serve to show that we are contributing our part to the settlement of cer- 
tain great problems of universal interest. i : 
Many of the clianges that have taken place in the general conduct of our colleges 
during the last decade have had sole reference to the increase or maintenance of the 
usual patronage, as, for example, the plan adopted by several colleges of holding ad- 
mission examinations in different centres. Other changes have affected the entire 
circle of college activity. Among the latter are the standards and modes of examina- 
tion, the extension of curricula, the adoption or extension of the optional system, 
and the changes in the modes and spirit of discipline. 
The reports of the colleges for successive years give a clear insight into the influ- 
ences that have gradually brought about these changes, and show also how cautiously, 
as a rule, the colleges have acted in these matters. New institutions springing up, 
untrammelled by old traditions, were guided in their purposes and their modes of pro- 
cedure by the modern spirit and modern requirements. The patronage, the worthy 
achievements, and the enviable recognition that the best of these attained helped to 
break down the conservatism of the older institutions. In many instancés the intelli- 
gent foresight of trustees or presidents or faculties anticipated the action which the 
coming time was sure to require. 
Admission requirements.— In nearly every eastern college the requirements for admis- 
sion are very different from what they once were, but this change has not been accom- 
plished by sudden or sweeping alterations. If we look, for instance, at the records of 
our oldest American college, we shall see that, between 1866 and 1876, the standards 
in Latin, Greek, and mathematics were sensibly raised. Option was introduced to 
this extent: those who for any reason preferred mathematics to classics were permitted 
to offer certain advanced mathematics instead of portions of Latin and Greek authors. 
English composition, with either French or German, was added, and the movement in 
   
-P-A-G-E-157

- SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, _ CLVII 
favor of science, which had begun in 1869~’70, when physical geography was made a 
requirement, was extended, every candidate being obliged to pass an examination in 
one of the three following subjects: (1) Elementary botany; (2) rudiments of physics 
and chemistry ; (3) rudiments of physics and descriptive astronomy. In 1876-77 it 
was further determined that every candidate should be required to pass upon a spec- 
ified minimum recuisition in all the preparatory studies, and also upon a further or 
maximum requisition in at least two of the four principal departments, Latin, Greek, 
mathematics, and physical and natural science. For examination upon a long speci- 
fied course of reading, it was proposed to substitute reading at sight in equally diffi- 
cult authors., For three years candidates were to be allowed to present themselves 
under either the old or the new method. 
Changes like these, which, as already observed, were not confined to a single insti- 
tution, affected the preparatory training on the one side and that of the college on 
the other. The results were looked forward to with interest not unmixed with anx- 
iety. 
In 187879 Dr. Eliot, the president of Harvard, made the following statement: 
It has been surprising to see how quickly the high schools, endowed academies, 
and private schools which habitually or frequently prepare boys for this college have 
accommodated their methods and their courses of study to the new requisitions of 
the faculty. The English requisition, first enforced so lately as 1874, has met with 
universal approval. The requisition in French or German, first enforced in 1875, 
has been fairly complied with, apparently without serious difficulty. The examina- 
tions in Latin and Greek at sight, which make part of the new method of admission 
adopted in 1876~77, can be avoided in Latin until 1881 and in Greek until 1883; but 
they have so commended themselves to the teachers of preparatory schools as fair 
tests of the acquaintance of their pupils with those languages that, out of 284 can- 
didates for admission to the freshman class in 1879, 179 chose to be examined in 
Latin at sight and about 150 in Greek; while at the preliminary examination of 
1879, out of 245 candidates, 215 were presented upon the new method, and of these 
215 only 8 chose to avoid the Greek examination at sight. The new requisition in 
science, first enforced in 1876, has been met moderately well, to all appearance; yet 
this is undoubtedly the requisition which in its practical working has given the least 
satisfaction to the faculty and the schools. 
Again, in his report for 1883~84, President Eliot says: 
The changes made in the requirements for admission to the college during the last 
fifteen years have not made admission more difficult. The percentage of candidates 
who are admitted is increasing slightly, and the percentage admitted uncondition- 
ally is increasing considerably. In 1884 one-half of the candidates adnitted entered 
without ‘‘conditions.” Improvements made in school methods of teaching and in 
the plan and method of the examinations themselves account for this gratifying re- 
sult. 
In the present state of preparatory training in our country, the question of the ex- 
tent to which options should be allowed becomes a serious one; and, as it appears at 
this date that Harvard is prepared to go very far in this direction, it is well to in- 
quire into the effect of the options already allowed. 
In 1882~83 it was found desirable to change somewhat the requirements in physics. 
«The object of this change,” says the dean of the college fa:ulty, ‘‘was not merely 
to secure a better training in physics through the use of better text books, but also 
to strengthen the elective group in physical science, which has proved to be consid- 
erably easier for the candidate to prepare than any of the other three groups. The 
difference has been by no means eliminated by this change, but it is thought that the 
state of the instruction in physics in the schools will not justify any greater increase 
at present.” 
In the report for 188384 the dean of the college faculty presents several tables, 
which, as he says, “show a remarkable steadiness in the proportion of candidates _ 
offering the classical and mathematical groups. The gain in these subjects this year, 
at the expense of the physical science group, is no doubt due to the change in the 
requirements in physics, described in my last report, which first went fully into oper- 
ation this year. The loss in numbers, it is reasonable to suppose, is more than made

up by improved quality and training of the candidates who have persisted in pre- 
ferring this department in spite of the increased difficulty of the examinations.” 
   | ELECTIVES, 
| 
AF cn University of Virginia is founded,” says Professor Venable, ‘on the elective 
system in its broadest sense.” Looking back over the sixty years’ record of this uni- 
versity, we may truly say that the system is neither a new nora doubtful experiment 
in this country. Asa rule, the State universities have followed, more or less imper- 
fectly, the model presented in Virginia. The time at which Boston University and 
Johns Hopkins University were founded and the nature of the work they proposed led 
them naturally to the same course. r 
It is the adoption of electives on the part of colleges that from their foundation 
employed ‘‘the uniform course” that hus caused the system to be so prominent a topic 
among usin recent years. Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Princeton be- 
gan the experiment with the knowledge before them of what it had done in Virginia 
and Michigan Universities toward meeting the difficulties and the demands that beset 
modern education; but those institutions had also good reason to know that the sys- 
tem was a source of weakness and confusion where the right conditions were wanting. 
No stronger proof could be given of the wisdom and judgment of the officers of the 
colleges specified than the fact that they have changed from the old order of things 
to the new without any sorious disturbance of their relations with preparatory 
schools, students, or the communities upon which they relied chiefly for support, and 
which were full of the traditions of the past. \ 
The experience of the colleges that haye recently introduced electives confirms that 
of the noted institutions in which no other system has been known, They are agreed 
that up to a certain age it is best for students to proceed along a restricted course of 
study, animated to the best efforts in their power by the expectation of definite ex- 
aminations and advancement according to merit. This ago, it is allowed, is somewhat 
in advance of the average age of candidates for admission to American colleges, for 
which reason electives are not generally allowed till the junior year. Harvard has 
gone further. Says Professor Eliot, in his report for 1883-84: 
The most important change made in the college during 1883-84 was the éxtension 
of the elective system to the freshman year, There are now no required studies in 
the college, except rhetoric for one year, English composition (themes and foren- 
sics), German or French for one year (whichever language was not presented by the 
student at the examination for admission), and afew lectures on chemistry and phys- 
sics, 
In other words, the uniform curriculum has given way, as President Eliot expresses 
it, ‘‘to a system which permits a free choice of studies and which prescribes little else 
than the number of studies to be pursued from year to year by the regular candidate 
for the degree and the order in which graded courses of instruction within the same 
department shall be pursued.” 
It is uot surprising that tho final steps taken by Harvard should have caused some 
concern among college officers throughout the country. An examination of the 
courses of study as arranged will bring to light several particulars in which the sys- 
tem as established at Harvard differs from the electives allowed elsewhere. Dr. Mc- 
Cosh, president of Princeton College, has pointed out that— 
It is perfectly practicable for a student to pass through Harvard and receive the 
degree of bachelor of arts without taking any course in Latin, Greek, mathematics, 
chemistry, physics, astronomy, geology, logic, psychology, ethics, political economy, 
German, or even English. 
eee reference to the accepted significance of the degrees of bachelor of arts and 
master of arts, the same writer says: 
Hancation is essentially the training of the mind—as the word edueare denotes— 
the drawing forth of the faculties which God has given us. This it should especially 
be in a university, ina studium generale, as it used to be called, The powers of 
{ } | i

mind are numerous and varied, the senses, the memory, the fancy, judgment, reason- 
ing, conscience, the feelings, the will; the mathematical, the metaphysical, the me- 
chanical, the poetical, the prosaic (quite as useful as any); and all these should be 
cultivated, the studies necessary to do so should be provided, and the student required 
so far to attend to them that the young man by exercise may know what powers he 
has and the mental frame be fully developed. To accomplish this end the degrees of 
bachelor of arts and master of arts were instituted. These titles have acquired a mean- 
ing. For centuries past tens of thousands of eager youths have been yearly seeking 
for them and the attainments implied in them. ‘True the standard adopted in some 
colleges has been low; some who have got the diploma could not read the Latin in 
which it is written ; still it has a certain prestige and a considerable attractive power. 
It indicates, as to the great body of those who possess it, that they have some acquaint- 
ance with elevated themes; that, in short, they have some culture. I donot wish to 
have this stimulus withdrawn, I have been laboring for the last thirty-two years to 
elevate the requirements for the degree. But let it retain its meaning and carry out 
its meaning thoroughly. Let it be an evidence that the possessor of it has some 
knowledge of literature, science, and philosophy. 
With reference to the same subject, Noah Porter, president of Yale College, says: 
We do not forget, however, as we have already intimated, that Harvard College is 
connected with the sister colleges by a common relationship, of which the so-called 
academic degrees are supposed td be the symbols. These degrees are the passport to 
a certain kind and measure of public esteem, as having a common signification. 
They are, in a certain sense, common property, a kind of trade mark or certificate, 
and recognized by common respect, and in some cases by civil statute. This respect 
may often be ill founded and excessive, and yet it may be of some value and at times 
have no little practical importance. Any measure which tends to make doubtful 
their significance or diminish the respect in which these degrees are held affects the 
interests and rights of all the institutions which give them, and is, in a certain 
sense, an offence against the common faith and common understanding which exist 
among educated men. Neither Harvard College nor any other college has any exclu- 
sive property in the degree of bachelor of arts, nor any right to dispose of it as it 
pleases, which is recognized by the court of either common sense or the common faith 
of the educated community. 
That such is the prevailing view among college presidents, faculties, &c., in the 
United States can hardly be doubted, when we considér a fact very emphatically 
stated by Dr. Porter in the article already alluded to: 
Hitherto all the colleges and universities of the country have kept faith with one 
another; and in every case in which they have proposed special courses, with a total 
or partial omission of classical or mathematical study, they have denoted this by a 
special degree. This has notably been true of Michigan, Cornell, and Brown Uni- 
versities, of Yale, Columbia, and Dartmouth Colleges. Moreover, the change proposed 
by President Eliot, of giving a varied significance to the bachelor’s degree, seems 
equally uncalled for, in view of the fact that the degree of pu. D. has already come 
into general use, and that this degree not only provides for, but requires, thorough 
studies in a wide curriculum of modern science : in that it does not require the study 
of the Greek language, but does require a competent knowledge of one modern lan- 
guage as an instrument of research. Consequently, it would seem to meet all the 
demands which are supposed to justify a change in the significance of the bachelor’s 
degree. 
In connection with the opinions here quoted, it is interesting to note the views 
entertained by Prof. Henry Morley, LL. D., with reference to the requirements for the 
B, a. degree, as set forth in an address delivered before the London International 
Conference on Education. Says Professor Morley : 
For the bachelor of arts there should be a 3-year course, during which I think 
there should be cultivation of not fewer than 5 subjects of study. During at least 
2of the 3 years there should be study of Latin ; during at least 2 there should be study 
of English ; in each case, of both language and literature. During at least 2 years 
there should be also study of mathematics; and during at least 2 there should be 
study of some natural science. I would allow no mind with strength for science to 
avoid the quickening touch upon its other powers that comes with a study of litera- 
ture; and I would allow no mind with a strength for literature to begin its higher 
training without help from the exact methods of science. The fifth study in the 
course of training that leads up to the B. a. degree, I would leave to depend upon 
the individual aims or tendencies of the student, Also the 1 year less than 3 of 
enforced study of each of the four subjects Latin and English, mathematics, and 
       
-P-A-G-E-160
  
    natural science, I would have occupied with work determined by a sense of fitness in 
each case, except that some time must be given to the continuance of the school 
studies of French and that German must be at least begun. Attainment of the de- 
gree should be dependent not upon one final examination, but on gradual and un- 
forced evidence of the attainment of aright standard of knowledge in each of the five chosen subjects of study. In each class there should be a first pass examination, based 
upon the teaching of the class. This should be open only to those students who had been 
in regular attendance for at least two sessions. Five first passes — four of them being 
those on the prescribed subjects —- obtained within any ycriod not shorter than 3 years, 
with a witness to good character signed by the 5 teachers, should, without further 
exal ination, entitle the student to the bachelor of arts degree. 
The choice of the students themselves with reference to siudies will have great 
effect in ultimately determining the measure of electives and the relation and sig- 
nificance of degrees. We have already sufficient data on this subject to show the 
prevailing tendencies, but I can do no more at this time than call attention to what 
is fegieatet by the record of degrees conferred, as set forth in Table XV and in state- 
ments in the abstracts of the respec tive States, appendix, under the head of Superior 
Instruction. 
The remaining movements that have been marked features of our recent college 
history, namely, the establishment and growth of graduate departments, the arrange- 
ments fur special students, modes of discipline, and physical culture, I must pass over 
for the present. The last named topic will be treated in extenso ina circular now in 
course of preparation for this Office by Dr. E. M. Hartwell, of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity.

SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION. CLXV 
The schools reported in Table X show but little change since the date of my last 
report. In Part 1, which includes the schools endowed with the national land grant 
of 1862, one new school is noted, viz, the Florida State Agricultural College. This 
is not yet thoroughly organized. 
In Part 2 of the table, 7 new schools or departments are reported, while 2 tabulated 
in 1882 no longer appear. * 
A total increase of 6 in the number of schools reported in Table X is thus shown, 
as compared with 1882. 
Nearly all the schools that appear this year for the first time in the table have 
been mentioned in my previous reports as either contemplated or about to be or- 
ganized. 
Since 1882, the numb2r of instructors in the schools of Table X has increased, while 
the number of students shows a slight falling off. 
The schools of the class here presented have been fully described in my previous 
annual reports and in the special report published by the Office in 1882. Moreover, 
they have been the subject of recent examination and report by foreign commissions 
deputed to inquire into the condition of industrial and technical education in the 
leading nations. Their general status is, therefore, well understood both at home 
and abroad. 
Table X, in summary and appendix, and the notices of the individual schools under 
the head of Scientific and Professional Instruction, in the abstracts of the appendix, 
set forth with sufficient clearness the present condition of these institutions and the 
slight changes that have occurred since my last report. I shall, therefore, confine 
‘myself to the notice of a very few particulars. 
As a nation, we have reason to be gratified with our record in respect to scientific 
and technical instruction. As early as 1824 provision was made in this direction by 
the organization of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, N. Y. Thesame year 
witnessed the foundation of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. These were fol- 
lowed at intervals of a few years by the scientific department of Virginia University, 
the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, and the 
Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, all organized before the close of 
1848, The significance of these dates is the more apparent when we recall that the 
Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, Paris, was not founded until 1829 and that 
the school of design, from which has developed the Science and Art Department of 
Great Britain, with its system of schools, museums, and grants, was not in operation 
before 1837. The department itself was formally created in 1856, or 6 years prior to 
the land grant by our Federal Government which made the movement in the United 
States toward special training for the arts and industries truly national. The com- 
pleteness with which certain of the schools have been equipped and the wisdom 
manifested in their adaptation to special conditions indicate that we have had in our 
midst men well qualified to direct this new development in education. 
A few of the many favorable comments of foreign authorities on this subject will 
suffice to show how thoroughly these provisions are appreciated abroad: 
Dr. Kerr, one of Her Majesty’s senior inspectors of schools, in a public address de- 
livered in November, 1883, after an account of the leading institutions of Germany, 
which he had just visited, added that he believed the finest science school of the 
world was at St. Louis, Mo. 
In the following December, on the occasion of the distribution of prizes to the 
students of Finsbury Technical College, Professor Huxley called attention to the fact 
that on the American side of the Atlantic there was a people of the same stock, blood, 
race, and power as the English, who would run them harder than any competitors had 
hitherto done. 
At a meeting held in Sheffield the same month with reference to forming plans for 
@ proposed technical department in connection with Firth College, Mr. Mundella  
-P-A-G-E-166

CLXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  stated that a friend of his who had just visited the ane States and inspected the 
means for technical education existing there, had formed the conclusion ‘that there 
is more skill and intelligence in American industrial pursuits than there isin our 
English industrial pursuits.” 
In his report on Technical Education in the United States, Mr. Mather says: | 
The preéminence of the Americans in many branches of mechanical industry ren- 
ders it necessary to give a general view of the character aud scope of the education 
in the public schools, as well as to discover what provision bas been and is being 
made for technical and industrial training. The provision made for science teaching 
in the many universities and colleges not directly technical in their character, in the 
various States, has also required my attention, for the reason that a large proportion: 
of the graduates of these institutions pass at once into the industrial arts after leay- 
ing college. Reet 
The act of Congress in conservating forever a large portion of the territorial wealth 
of the nation for the purposes of industrial and scientific education is a sagacious 
scheme of statesmanship. There is provided in every State at least one centre from 
which all the knowledge necessary to instruct the youth of the State in scientific in- 
dustry may radiate, That many of these colleges have drifted from the original in- 
tention of the authors of the act is only a temporary evil. The tide has set in the 
other direction now and the marked success of those colleges, such as in New York 
State, Michigan, Llinois, Missouri, &c., in the direction of technical instruction, is 
gradually leading to the conversion of all. * * * 
It will be seen from the foregoing description of the technical and science schools 
that there exists in America a certain number of high class institutions for technical 
and scientific training in mining, civil, and mechanical engineering. I am of opinion 
that in these branches, judging from my own observation, there is nothing better of 
the kind, though such institutions are more numerous at present in Europe. The 
advantage in the training in the best of them is its practicalness. The students feel 
that careers are open to them if only they have acquired the art of applying their 
knowledge; hence their ambition is excited and every one of them appears to be 
working for a definite purpose. There is nothing pretentious about these students. 
Some of them are poor, but they must have shown marked ability in order to get the 
advantages of the free or partially free instruction. Thus a limited number of clever 
sons of workingmen have the road opened up for a thorough scientific training, if 
they can afford to give the time. * * * 
There can be no doubt that America owes much already to the schools which exist 
for technical education, though not.actually helping the artisan class. Many hundreds 
of young men have been furnished from these sources for the superintendence of rail- 
way works, mining operations, machine shops, and the textile industries, besides 
chemical works, glass manufactories, building operations, agriculture, &c. 1 have 
met in almost all the mannfactories I have visited —from mining, iron and steel man- 
ufacturing, through all the mechanic arts, up to watch making and sewing machine 
manufacturing —evidences of the influence of the technical schools. { 
These are views upon which it is pleasant to dwell, but there is another and less 
flattering side to the record which it will not do for us to ignore, The schools en- 
dowed by the national land grant of 1862 are often and very appropriately desig- 
nated as “colleges for the people,” by which we are evidently to understand the 
people who are not likely to become classical scholars or scientific experts and spe- 
cialists. A few of these schools are found among what Mr. Mather terms “high class 
‘institutions for technical and scientific training in mining, civil, and mechanical en- 
gineering;” but the majority must fulfil the purpose suggested in the words of Hon. 
Justin L. Morrill in his speech at the time of the passage of the land grant act: 
“They must be institutions accessible to all, but especially to the sons of toil.” To 
this end they should be so codrdinated with the common schools of the rural dis- 
tricts that the pupils who have finished the course in these may be ready for admis- 
sion to the colleges, in which they should receive training suited to their probable 
careers in life. 
The instruction which these schools offer is at present too theoretic and follows too 
closely the model of the classical college. So far as science ig concerned, the great 
difficulty is the want of the material equipment. The training in agriculture and the 
mechanic arts languishes from various causes, Competent men are not easily found 
to organize and conduct these departments, and in many States the rural population
-P-A-G-E-167
  INSTRUCTION “IN AGRICULTURE. ¢. =. cOLx Vi 
have little faith in the utility of the training, especially the agricultural training; 
so that the provision which the colleges are able to make for this branch is not-prop- 
erly appreciated. When State aid is withdrawn from an agricultural college on the 
plea that such colleges are not required, as has been done in one instance, and when 
the labor of ordinary farm hands is prized above that of the graduates from agricult- 
ural schools, young men have small inducement to pursue the courses of training. It 
rests chiefly with the sehools themselves to remove these hindrances to their successful 
operation, but this can only be accomplished by gradual advances. In several of the 
Northwestern States, agricultural colleges or departments of colleges have passed the 
time of severest trial and have gained an assured position among the agencies that 
are deemed essential to the development of the local resources. In every such case it 
will be found that the colleges have had to create the sentiment that now operates 
for their support and progress. This has been dono through the persistent efforts of 
men who joined to scientific knowledge practical experience in farming and through 
codperation with State boards of agriculture and other associations which brought 
the schools into intimate relations with the farming population. In Kansas, farmers’ 
institutes held under the auspices of the agricultural college have proved of great 
advantage. Experimental stations established in a few States have done much 
toward counteracting the low estimate in which “scientific farming” is held, and it 
is desirable that their number should be increased. 
The teaching of agriculture was a subject of earnest and prolonged discussion 
before the London International Conference on Education, which has been several 
times referred to in these pages. On the general propdsition of the practicability and 
the valuable results of such teaching, the delegates from the various nations, with 
very few exceptions, were agreed. : 
Mr. John Wrightson,! M.R.A.0., F.0.8., called attention to the perfect unanimity 
with respect to the subjects which form a complete curriculum of agricultural knowl- 
edge, as shown by the syllabuses of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, of 
the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, of the Institution of Surveys, 
and of every agricultural college in Europe, in the United States, and the United 
Kingdom. 
It was in the methods by which the general scheme of instruction is carried out in 
the several countries represented that differences were observable, and as these meth- 
ods were explained in detail and the results set forth it was impossible to resist the 
conviction that, where the teaching of agriculture fails, it fails not from the want of 
knowing what to do, but from the want of knowing how to do it or the want of the 
necessary relations between the teaching agencies and the agricultural system of the 
country. The United States was ably represented in this discussion by Prof. N. 8. 
Townshend, of the Ohio State University, whose explanation of the work which he 
has conducted in that institution was received with deep interest. 
Commenting upon certain of the papers, the chairman, Mr. St. John Ackers, ob- 
served, as stated in the report of the proceedings, that— 
Professor Townshend himself was evidently a practical farmer before he became a 
teacher; and if we could only get practical farmers to become teachers of the science 
of agriculture, or rather of all those sciences which went to make up the great art of 
agriculture, he for one should say that we had indeed arrived at a condition far in 
advance of anything which existed at the present time throughout the length and _ 
breadth of the land. 
As I have already suggested, it is not easy in this country to find men possessing 
such qualifications, but here, as in Great Britain, they are essential to the successful 
teaching of agriculture.

The foregoing summary shows that, in general, the proportion to one theological 
school was about 5 professors and 37 students and that there were about 7 students 
to 1 professor. More in detail, we find that the Protestant German schools had nearly 
10 students to one professor ; that the Wesleyan and the Baptist seminaries had more 
than 8 students to 1 professor; that the Roman Catholic schools reported somewhat less 
than 8 students to 1 professor; that the churches called Presbyterian had nearly 7 
students to 1 professor; the Congregational bodies, more than 5 students to 1 profes-

T ; TABLE XI.—-SCHOOLS OF LAW. 
The following is a statement of the number of schools of law reporting to this Bu-

Comparing the number of clergymen and of lawyers i 
the annual attendance on divinity schools and on law schools for _ series of eae: ag 
shown above, it is very obvious that the lawyers of the Union do not obtain eal

professional training, or the theoretical part thereof, from their professional schools, 
to any such extent as do clergymen from schools of theology. The tabular compari- 
son below is prepared from the summaries given in my report for 1880; it shows the 
annual attendance upon theological and law schools from 1871 to 1880, inclusive:

It is to be remembered further that nearly all the religious denominations now favor 
a preliminary collegiate education for their clergy and that the course of theological 
study in most schools is three years in duration ; the law schools usually require but 
two years of study before graduation, and most of them do not require advanced 
preparatory training. 
A very large number of lawyers do not attend law schools, except for one session ; 
many do not attend at all; these classes ‘‘read law” in the offices of members of the 
bar. This is often thought to be advantageous because it makes the young man early 
familiar with the practical side of his profession; but here, as elsewhere, the lack 
of liberal culture and of thor ough historical study of the law is a hindrance to almost 
* every kind of real success ; men may make money under such circumstances, but 
they seldom grow up to the full standard of legal stature, lacking, as they must, the 
humane nutrition of general culture. Many of the objections urged against an elec- 
tive judiciary might be set aside without hesitation if the laws of the State should 
require of every candidate for the bench good evidence of his thorough preliminary 
and professional training and the attainment of at least his fortieth year. 
The following summary shows the number of lawyers in each State and Territory in 
1880, according to the Federal census of that year. In the Union, as a whole, the pro- 
portion of lawyers to the whole population was as 1 to 782.

Remembering that the total population of the Union in 1880 was 50,155,783, we sea 
that the proportion thereof to the number of medical men in the Union was as 584 
to1; to the number of dentists, as 4,073 to 1; and to the number of pharmacists, as 
1,811 to 1. 3

RESUME OF CENSUS STATISTICS. 
It will be seen from the foregoing tables that the census of 1880 reported 254,520 
persons as engaged in the duties of clergymen, lawyers, physicians and surgeons, 
dentists, and pharmacists. In other words, the learned professions of law, medicine, ' 
and divinity number, in the aggregate, more than one-two-hundredths of the entire 
population. The size of this report forbids a detailed consideration of the proportion 
of these professions to the populations of the several States and Territories. 
I can only spare space here for an example of some tabular studies respecting the 
distribution of pharmacists in 1880 between the urban and other parts of the States. - 
In the following table, the number of pharmacists in the urban parts of each State is | 
assumed to be, to the urban population, as 1 to 1,500, while in the States that showed © 
as a whole a larger proportion of pharmacists, the proportion of urban pharmacists to _ 
‘urban population is calculated to be as 1 to 1,000,

OLXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TABLE XIV.—UNITED STATES MILITARY AND NAVAL ACADEMIES. 
In Table XIV of the appendix will be found the statistics of the examinations of 
candidates for admission to the United States Naval and Military Academies for the 
year 1881, 
TABLE XV.— DEGREES, 
The following summary shows for 1883 the number and kind of degrees, in course 
and honorary, that were conferred in the United States. The number of degrees 
noted as conferred in theology does not really represent the number of graduates in 
that faculty, because many of the best schools mention in their graduation certificates 
no particular degree as conferred on the graduate. All such cases, whenever they can 
be ascertained, should be classed as bachelors of divinity. As most of these gradu- 
ates were also preliminarily educated in a classical collegiate course, ending with the 
bachelorship of arts, and as they usually receive, three years later, the mastership of 
arts as a matter of course, they have no need of a professional degree,

  CLXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Adding the totals of the preceding summary to those of the summaries of 1882, 
1831, 1880, 1879, 1878, 1877, 1876, and of the Special Report on Public Libraries pub- 
lished by this Bureau in 1876 (see also the Report of the Commissioner of Education 
for 1875, p. cvii), we have the following aggregates for the libraries now reported: 
Total number of public libraries reported, each having 300 volumes or up-

It should be noted, however, that the figures for these items are but approximately 
true for the libraries of the country, inasmuch as they do not include the very con- 
siderable increase of the 3,647 libraries embraced in the Special Report on Public 
Libraries or the increase of the 472 libraries embraced in the Reports of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, 181, and 18¥2~’g3, from the dates 
thereof, to the present time. 
The above table gives the statistics of 384 libraries not included in my previous re- 
ports. The total number tabulated from 1875 to 1834, inclusive, is 4,503. 
The Bureau has now in progress a work on libraries that is intended to supplement 
the special report published in 1876. Some topics not treated in that publication 
will be presented and the subjects therein considered will be brought down to date.

  CXCIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Tables XVIII-XXII, inclusive, present the statistics of several classes of institutions 
that were very fully treated in my last annual report. No material change has taken 
place in any of these since that date. In Table XVIII (institutions for the deaf and 
dumb) 2 additional schools are reported, all having under instruction 22,515 pupils, 
as against 22,991 in 1882~83. State appropriations for the current year amount to 
$1,551,727, an increase of $288,554. Expenditures for the year amount to $1,595,191, 
an inerease of $151,805. 
In Table XIX (schools for the blind) 1 additional school is reported. The number 
of pupils is 2,319, an increase of 65. State or municipal appropriations for the year 
amount to $647,041, an increase of $66,657; total receipts, to $913,722, an increase of 
$57,110; expenditures, to $599,285, a decrease of $78,350. 
_ In Table XX (schools for feeble-minded youth) 2 new schools are reported, viz: 
the California Association for the Care and Training of Feeble-Minded Children and 
Family Home Schoo] for Nervous and Delicate Children, Amherst, Mass. The total 
number of inmates in all these schools has increased since 1882-’83 from 2,434 to 2,505; 
income, from $408,953 to $575,212, and expenditures, from $450,900 to $570,948. 
Reform schools (‘Table XXI) are reported from 22 of the 38 States of the Union and 
the District of Columbia; in all, 62 schools are included. The total annual cost (3 
schools not reporting) amounted to $2,010,237 and the total earnings (7 schools not re- 
porting) to $387,514. 
For further particulars concerning the institutions here briefly noticed, the reader 
is referred to the abstracts of the appendix, under the head of Special Instruction in 
the respective States.

  CXCVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The foregoing summary exhibits the total of donations and legacies by individualsin 
aid of education for eighteen months, from January 1, 1883, to July 1, 1884, so far as ve- 
ported to this Office, and the classes of institutions that are the recipients of the bene- 
factions. The total amount of these reported was $11,270,236. My former reports 
have exhibited the benefactions for one year each; proportionally, the above sum shows 
an increase over the benefactions for any previous year since 1873. My report for that 
year gives benefactions from October 15, 1872, to October 15, 1873, amounting to 
$11,226,977. 
From the table before us it appears that benefactions amounting to one or more 
millions of dollars are reported from Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland. As 
usual, universities and colleges secure the largest proportion of these gifts. Schools 
of theology come next. Preparatory schools and institutions for secondary instruc- 
tion together received $1,210,006. 
For full particulars concerning these benefactions, their sources, purposes, &c., the 
reader is referred to Table XXIII, appendix. 
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
I.—EUvROoPE. 
AusTRIA-HUNGARY.—a@. AUSTRIA, constitutional monarchy: Area, 115,903 square miles; population 
(December 31, 1880), 22,144,244. Capital, Vienna; population, 1,108,857. Minister of public instruc- 
tion, Conrad von Eybesfeld. 
The new Austrian school law took effect May 2, 1883. The bill provoked in the 
Reichsrath a most animated debate, which lasted through thirteen sessions and partook 
at times of a vehement character. The spectators frequently applauded the speak- 
ers, notwithstanding the admonitions of the president. The matters which formed 
the principal subjects of discussion on the part of the liberals were embodied in 
articles 21 and 48 of the law, the former of which lessens the period of obligatory 
School attendance, while the latter seems likely to effect a return to the system of 
the confessional school. The bill was finally passed in the upper house by a vote of 
170 to 167, The anticlerical press throughout the empire expressed itself strongly in 
condemnation of the vote, which, by a majority of only three, gave a decided ad- 
vantage to the Roman Catholic party, and the number of the Freie Pidagogische Blitter 
for May 5, 1883, which contained an article reflecting on the new law, was confiscated 
by the authorities. The liberals urged against article 21 that through it a blow was 
aimed at the principle of obligatory school attendance. That article is as follows: 
The period during which children must attend school begins with the end of the 
sixth and lasts until the end of the fourteenth year. But scholars should be allowed 
to leave the elementary schools when they have acquired a sufficient knowledge of 
the most important branches taught in those schools, viz, religion, reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. After completing a 6-year course at the common elementary schools, 
children in the country and children of poor parents in the cities may be exempted 
from a part of the regular school course at the request of their parents or those acting 
in their place. This exemption shall consist in limiting the teaching of such children 
to a part of the year or to half days or to single days in the week. This exemption 
may also be granted to children of entire districts or communes in the country, at 
the request of the authorities of the communes acting on the decision of the district 
or communal committee. In this case the plan of studies may be so arranged that 
instruction in the short course shal] be given in divisions separate from the classes of 
the other scholars until the pupils of such divisions shall have completed their four- 
teenth year. In all these cases the course of study must be such as to enable the 
children who follow it to become familiar with the subjects generally prescribed for 
schools of this grade. At the close of the school year those scholars who have not 
yet completed their fourteenth year, but who will do so during the next half year, 
and who have completely mastered the subjects of study prescribed for common 
schvols, may be excused from further attendance by the district school authorities 
for sufficient reasons. 
Article 48 declares that — 
Positions in the public schools are public offices, open to all citizens who have obtained 
the proper legal qualifications therefor. But only those teachers may be selected for
-P-A-G-E-199
    EDUCATION *IN- FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CXCIX 
principals who have also obtained a qualification to give religious instruction in the 
denomination to which the majority of the scholars of the schools of which they are 
to have charge belong, taking the average of the previous five school years. In esti- 
mating this average, scholars of the different evangelical creeds shall be regarded as 
belonging to one denomination. It shall be the duty of the principals to take part 
in the supervision of the scholars at the regularly prescribed religious exercises con- 
ducted by teachers of the denomination required in the schools under their charge. 
No person can obtain a teacher’s position who has been rendered ineligible to a place 
in the district representation by reason of any legal punishment. 
This article excited a great deal of discussion and was vigorously opposed by the 
liberals on the ground that it favored a return to the confessional or denominational 
school.

of the Commissioner of Education. The statistics of education for 1884 reached the 
Bureau too late for compilation for the present report. 
Illiteracy in Austria-Hungary. — The following statement of illiteracy in the Austro- 
Hungarian monarchy has been prepared from statistics published by Ignaz Hatsek in 
Petermanns Mittheilungen aus Justus Perthes’ Geographischer Anstalt. 30 Band, 
1884. VI. The author compiled his figures from the census returns for 1880 and used 
them to prepare a colored map showing the degrees of illiteracy in different parts of 
the monarchy. The accompanying map shows the same facts, with letters instead of 
colors to represent- degrees of illiteracy. 
The following table shows the average percentage of illiteracy in the different 
crown lands of the monarchy, together with the highest and lowest percentage in 
each. Illiteracy here applies to persons unable to read and write,

Beterom, constitutional monarchy: Area, 11,373 square miles; population (December 31, 1880), ,519,844. 
Capital, Brussels; population, 388,781. Minister of public instruction, M. Victor Jacobs in carly part 
of 1884.and M. Thonissen from October 26, 1884. 
The new Belgian school law received the sanction of the King in September, 1884. 
The text is here substantially given: 
ARTICLE 1. At least one communal school shall be established ina suitable place in 
each commune. 
A commune may adopt and subsidize one or more private schools. In this case 
the King may, with the advice of the permanent committee, excuse the commune 
from the obligation of establishing or maintaining a communal school, but not if 
twenty fathers of families, having children of school age, demand such establishment 
or maintenance for the education of their children. 
Two or more communes may, when necessary, be authorized by the King to unite in 
establishing or supporting a school. 
Art. 2, The primary communal schools are to be managed by the communes. The 
communal council will determine the number of schools and teachers according to 
local requirements. It will also regulate everything relating to the establishment 
and organization, of infant and adult schools. 
Art. 3. The children of poor parents shall receive gratuitousinstruction. The com- 
munes are to see that all those who do not attend uninspected private schools are 
provided with instruction either in a communal or adopted school. The communal 
council, on communication with the board of charities, shall draw upevery year a list 
of poor children receiving gratuitous instruction in the communal or adopted schools 
and determine the amount of pay due the teachers of those schools from each scholar 
receiving such instruction. This list and the assessment of the amount due shall be 
submitted for approval to the committee, subject to appeal to the King. The com- 
mittee shall also determine, under appeal to the King, the proportion to be paid by 
the board of charities for the education of poor children, and the proportion so as- 
signed shall be included in the appropriation for the board. 
Art. 4. The communes may place religious and moral instruction at the head of 
the program of some or all of their primary schools. This instruction shall be given 
at the beginning or end of the recitations. Children whose parents request it are to 
be excused from attending this exercise. x 
Primary instruction comprises necessarily reading; writing; the elements of arith- 
metic; the systems of weights and measures prescribed by law; the elements of French, 
Flemish, or German, according to locality; geography; drawing and singing; and the 
history of Belgium. It also includes gymnastics for boys and needlework for girls, 
and, in rural communes, the elements of agriculture for boys. The communes shall 
have a right to enlarge this program when desirable and circumstances permutt. 
Whenever, in a commune, twenty fathers of families having children of school age 
ask to have their children excused from atiending religious instruction, the King 
may, on the request of the parents, oblige the commune to organize one or more spe- 
cial classes for the children of such parents. 
If, notwithstanding the request of twenty fathers of families having children of 
school age, the commune offers an obstacle to including thereligions instruction they 
desire in the school program and to having such instruction given by ministers of 
their sect or by persons acceptable to the latter, the government may, at the request 
of the parents, adopt and support one or more private schools as required, provided 
they fultil the conditions necessary for adoption in the commune. 
Art, 5. Teachers shall show an equal solicitude for the education and instruction 
of the children under their charge. They are to neglect no opportunity to inspire 
in their pupils the sentiments of duty, love of country, respect for national institu- 
tions, and attachment to constitutional liberty. They shall abstain from any attack 
upon the religious beliefs of the families whose children are intrusted to them. 
Art, 6. The communes are to bear the expenses of primary instruction in the com- 
munal schools. The provinces are to aid the communes to an extent not less than 
two centimes additional to the amount of the direct tax. No commune shall obtain 
subsidies from the state or province for primary instruction unless the commune con- 
tributes at least four centimes additional to the direct tax and carries out the present 
law in all points, 
Arr. 7, The communal council shall have the power of appointing, suspending, and 
removing teachers; but removal of teachers can only be effected on approval by the 
permanent committee; both the council and the teachers have the right to appeal to 
the King. 
The same rules apply to suspension with stoppage of pay, when such suspevsion 
exceeds one month. Suspension once decreed by the communal council cannot be 
renewed by it on the same facts, nor exceed six months in duration. The council 
shall fix the salaries of teachers, which shall not be less than 1,000 francs for assistant  
-P-A-G-E-202
    
ccir REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
teachers and 1,200 for teachers, including perquisites. Teachers shall be entitled to 
lodging or an equivalent, to be fixed by mutual agreement. In case of disagreement 
appeal may be had to the committee, and then to the King. 
The communal council may place a teacher on the unattached list, and so keep him 
from active employment, in which case he will receive waiting pay, under conditions 
which will be determined by royal decree. This pay will be furnished by the state, the 
provinees and the commune, in the proportions fixed by article 5 of the law of May 16, 
1876. 
Art. 8. Those persons are to be taken as communal teachers who are Belgians by 
birth or naturalization and who have obtained diplomas as primary teachers on gradu- 
ating from a public normal school or one subject to inspection or who possess second 
grade diplomas of secondary instruction. Such teachers may also be selected from 
among those who have successfully passed an examination for teachers before a board. 
organized by the government. 
Art. 9. No primary schoo! may be adopted or receive support from a commune, a 
province, or the state without subjecting itself to inspection, giving poor children 
gratuitous instruction, and adopting the program required by article 4. ‘Teachers 
should have passed an examination, as mentioned in article 8, but the minister is at lib- 
aaa oe with this condition during thé two years following the promulgation 
of this law. 
Those who have had charge of communal schools prior to the present law are 
exempt from examination. 
The number of hours ina week to a class shall not be less than twenty, and, deduct- 
ing the time employed in needlework, not less than sixteen hours. 
Violations of legal requirements shall be brought to the knowledge of the govern- 
ment by the inspectors, and the same rule sball hold with regard to any other abuses 
in the schools. If the school authorities shall refuse to submit to the law or reform 
abuses, the support granted by the commune, province, and state shall be withdrawn 
by royal decree and the fact, with the reason therefor, published in the Moniteur. 
Art. 10. The inspection of communal and adopted schools shall be exercised by the 
state. Inspection shall not extend to religious and moral instruction and shall be 
regulated by the government. Each province is to have one or several principal in- 
spectors, and there are also to be cantonal inspectors. Each cantonal inspector is to 
visit all the schoolsof the canton at least once a year. At least once in three months 
teachers of the district or canton are to hold a conference, presided over by the local 
inspector, at which the state of primary instruction in the district is to be reported 
upon. The principal inspector is to preside over an annual conference of primary 
teachers, to visit at least every two years all the schools under his charge, and to 
send in an annual report to the minister. All primary schools are to have a part in 
these conferences. 
Art. 11. The state, the provinces, and the communes may establish normal schools. 
Art. 12. The organization of normal schools belonging to the state will be regu- 
lated by the government. 
Art. 13. The provincial and communal normal schools, as well as private normal 
schools, may receive state aid, provided they are willing to be subject to inspection. 
ArT. 14, The communal inspectors and teachers and the directors, professors, and 
teachers of state normal schools must take the oath prescribed by article 2 of the de- 
cree of July 20, 1831. 
Art, 15. A report on the condition of primary instruction shall be presented to the 
legislature by the government every three years. 
Art. 16. The law of July, 1879, is hereby repealed, as are also articles 2, 3, and 
4 and the last paragraph of the first article of the law of December 28, 1883, Ar- 
ticles 121 and 147 of the communal law are restored as worded in the law of May 7, 
1877. Article 1 of the law of June 15, 1881, is modified so as to provide that the num- 
ber of athen#ums and colleges shall not exceed 20; the number of secondary schools 
for boys, 100, and for girls, 50. 
ArT. 17, Persons who shall have obtained the diploma of primary teacher from a 
private normal school between January 1, 1880, and the date of repeal of the law of 
July 1, 1879, may receive the appointment of communal teacher ou condition of 
obtaining a confirmation of sech diploma from a board organized in accordance with 
article 8. It shall be the duty of the board to see that the private normal school 
giving the diploma is organized so as to train teachers to be capable of keeping com- 
munal primary schools established in conformity with the present law. The board 
may make the confirmation, subject to a complementary examination on certain mat- 
ters to be designated by it. In such case the teacher who has a diploma shall bave 
one year to prepare for the examination. He may meanwhile exercise the functions 
of a communal teacher provisionally.

  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ccrnt 
Denmark, constitutional monarchy: Area, 14,553 square miles; population (estimated January 1, 
1882), 2,018,432. Capital, Copenhagen; population (with suburbs), 273,323. Minister of public in- 
struction, J. F. Scavenius, 
The latest general information in regard to education in Denmark may be found in 
the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1882~83. From the report of the 
Polytechnic School at Copenhagen the following items are gathered for 1884: The 
course of instruction covered mathematics, descriptive geometry, physics, chemistry, 
nrineralogy, geognosy and descriptive geography, botany, zodlogy, drawing, tech- 
nical chemistry, construction of machines and technical mechanics, technology, en- 
gineering, land surveying and levelling, and architecture. Each course takes four 
and one-half years. In 1883 and the early part of 1884 there were a few medical and 
pharmaceutical students from the university pursuing a course of instruction in the 
laboratory connected with this institution. On Angust 1, 1884, the faculty cousisted 
of a director, an inspector, and 24 professors and assistants. In the autumn of 1883 
there were 180 students reported; in the spring of 1884 there were 151. 
FINLAND, 8 dependency of Russia: Area, 144,222 square miles; population, 2,081,612, Capital, Hel- 
singfors; population, 43,142. 
The Statistik Arsbok for Finland, 1884, reports 168 rural communities in 1882~83 
without higher primary schools. There were, however, 302 rural districts with such 
a grade of school. Thirteen of these had four or more, 40 had three, 105 had two, 
and 144had oneeach. Four normals graduated 91 teachers for primary grades in 1883. 
The teaching force in these seminaries numbered 47; pupils, 540. There were seven 
lower elementary schools, with 21 teachers and 249 pupils. Four preparatory schools, 
with 12 teachers and 180 pupils, led up to 24 lycées, in which were 3,834 pupils, under 
charge of 318 teachers and professors. In 18 real schools were 817 pupils and 133 in- 
structors. The Polytechnic Institute at Helsingfors reported 105 students pursuing 
studies in architecture, engineering, constructing machines, surveying, and chemistry. 
There were 26 teachers. In the university at Helsingfors were 785 students in actual 
attendance (1 of these a woman), while there were 1,422 students on the rolls. The 
theological, legal, medical, and philosophical faculties had 67 professors in all and there 
were 10 vacant chairs. The income was (for 1883) 956,200 marks, the expenditures 
were 877,300. In addition to these various institutions of learning there were 2 tech- 
nical professional schools, with 12 teachers and 79 pupils. These are state schools and. 
are situated at Abo and Nikolaistad. The establishments for the instruction of young 
women numbered 41, with 439 teachers and 3,354 pupils. Of these schools 2 were 
German, 9 Finnish, and 30 Swedish. 
From another source comes the information that the subject of coeducation is one 
which is interesting the Finnish authorities, and in September, 1883, a ‘‘samskola for 
gossar och flickor” (mixed school) was established in Finland, which, at date of the 
communication received, was considered very successful. 
FRANCE, republic: Area, 204,177 square miles; population (December 18, 1881), 37,672,048. Capital, 
Paris; population, 2,269,028. Minister of public instruction, A. Fallires (succeeded M, Jules Ferry 
on November 20, 1883). 
Primary instruction.—In France the subject of popular education has taken a strong 
hold both on the government and the people. A new law was passed in the early 
part of 1882 by which education for all classes was made obligatory and non-religious. 
In June, 1834, a commission of eighteen of the leading educators of France completed 
and published the third volume of their report on the statistics of primary education. 
The first volume, published in 1878, covered the year 1b76~77; the second volume, 
published in 1880, included the years 1829 to 1877, thus covering the whole history of 
elementary schools as they exist to-day. The third volume (Statistique de l’instruc- 
tion primaire pour l’année scolaire 1881-1882) embraces statistics for 1881~82. Accord- 
ing to this, there were 71,547 primary school of all kinds (maternal schools excepted)  
-P-A-G-E-204
  CCIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in a to 75,635 in 1882; teachers, 110,709 in 1877 to 124,965 in 1882, The pupils reg- 
istered inereased from 4,716,935 to 5,341,211, without counting 644,384 in maternal 
schools. In 1882~’83 90,940 additional pupils were counted on the lists. The statistical 
commission finds a decided decrease from 1877 to 1882 in children who have no school 
privileges. In the five years, an increase of nearly 4,000 schools is reported, 2,247 of 
these ibe girls; in 1882-83 an increase of 1,513 schools is seen. During the period 
under consideration many denominational schools have been transformed into lay 
institutions. The 13,205 public ‘“congréganiste” schools! of 1877 were reduced to 
11,265 in 1882, while the private denominational schools increased by 1,475 in the 
same period. Higher primaries, established by the communes towards the latter part 
of the five years, numbered 570 at the close of 1883, with 30,000 pupils. The number 
of certificates of primary studies increased from 91,153 in 1882 to 107,060 in 1883. 
Still the use of this certificate is not general enough to give any evidence of the prog- 
ress accomplished. As the future of the primary school depends upon the capacity 
of the teacher, a law of August 9, 1879, was enacted authorizing each department of 
France to maintain two normal schools, one for men the other for women teachers. 
From 1877 to 1882 4 normals for men and 23 for women were established; in 1882~’83 
there were 18 more created, and in 1884 the 12 normals which were lacking were being 
established. Another need of these schools was proper instructors, so as to form good 
teachers for the primary grades. The government, therefore, created an institution 
at Fontenay-aux-Roses to prepare women and another school at St. Cloud to prepare 
men to fill positions as teachers in the normal grades. A law of June 16, 1881, which 
required teachers to have a certificate of capacity (brevet de capacité) is securing 
good results, In 1877 there were 41,712 teachers uncertificated ; in 1882, 26,677; in 
1883 there were only 21,781 without such brevet. The delay allowed by law expires 
in October, 1884; and, from that date on, no teachers without certificates will be em- 
ployed, unless in certain cases where age and term of service are taken into consider- 
ation. The law of June 16, 1881, in making the schools free to all, did away with 
school fees on the part of parents, while the fifth part of the ordinary revenue required 
of the communes for school purposes is almost entirely dispensed with. On account 
of these changes the state subsidies, which, in 1877, were 12,500,000 francs? on a total 
of 74,500,000 for ordinary expenses of public primary schools, were, in 1882, increased. 
to 68,500,000 on a total of 102,000,000. If to this amount there be added expenditures 
for normal schools, for primary inspection, and other expenses for primary instruction, 
the budget for 1882 reaches 132,314,000 francs against 94,397,000 francs in 1877, The 
state figures in the former sum to the amount of 87,500,000 francs; the depart- 
ments, to 17,500 000; the communes—without reckoning any extra expenditures— 
     
to 27,000,000. And yet these figures are not complete as far as funds required for 
school purposes are considered, because large sums have been given for erection of 
school buildings. Between 1877 and 1882 amounts aggregating 220,000,000 francs were 
set aside for school uses; from 1878 to 1886, 368,000,000 francs. State subsidies to the 
amount of 166,440,000 francs have been divided among the communes and loans have 
been authorized of 168,000,000 francs. 
The period embraced in this report has been one of transition, so to speak. Various 
educational laws have been enacted, such as the law of June 1, 1878, relative to con- 
struction of school buildings; that of August 9, 1879, on the establishment of primary 
normals; the decree of January 15, 1881, concerning higher primary instruction; the 
laws of July 3, 1880, and August 2, 1881, relative to school budgets; decree of January 
4, 1881, on the certificate of capacity; that of October 10, 1881, relating to village 
schools; the two laws of June 16, 1881, which established gratuitous instruction in 
_ public primary grades and regulated certificates of capacity for primary instruction; 
and the decree of August 2, 1881, on the organization of maternal schools. The law 
_ of March 28, 1882, on obligatory school attendance, which brought forth many changes 
  1Schools under teachers connected with some religious body.

in the organization of primary instruction, has only been in force from the beginning 
of 1882~83, 
Statements received later than the above report indicate that, although all the ex- 
pectations raised by the new laws have not yet been realized, still in many respects 
there is a marked improvement in the educational status of France since instruction 
has been made obligatory and non-religious for all classes. This is manifest by the 
increase in public schools and by the prosperity of private schools. It is stated, how- 
ever, that the improvement in the personnel of the public schools leaves considerable 
to be desired, and one reason given is the lowering of the standard of requirements. 
Later information may show a change in this respect. 
Secondary education.—From the proceedings of the International Conference on Ed- 
ucation, held in London in 1884, the following interesting report of this grade of 
education is taken: 
There are in France two kinds of public institutions of secondary education: the 
lycées and the communal colleges. The law allows any private person with the de- 
gree of bachelier to open, on certain conditions, a private establishment of secondary 
education, which may not be called either a lycée or a college. 
The buildings of lycées and colleges belong to the towns, and both the lycées and 
colleges are under the direction of the state, which appoints and exercises direct su- 
pervision over the directors and professors. The expenses of the lycées are entirely 
borne by the state; those of the communal colleges are borne by the towns. The 
state generally bears a part of the expense in the shape of a subsidy. Another dif- 
ference between the lycées and the colleges is that a titular professor in a lycée must 
be an agrégé, while it is sufficient to hold a licentiate degree to be appointed titular 
professor in a college. 
Each department has on an average one lycée and four or five colleges. There aro 
in Paris seven lycées and one college. e 
Secondary education, as given in the lycées and colleges, is classical or special. 
Classical education for boys of eleven to eighteen, on an average, comprises French 
language and literature, German or English, Latin, Greek, history, geography, phi- 
* losophy, and the elements of mathematical, physical, and natural sciences. For pupils 
wishing to acquire a highly scientific culture and preparing for admission to the 
polytechnic school or the scientific section of the Ficole Normale Supérieure (higher 
training school), or the faculties of science, the Collége de France, and the Museum, 
there is in every lycée a class of ‘elementary mathematics,” aud in the most impor- 
tant lycées a class of “special mathematics” for instruction in analytical geometry, 
the higher branches of algebra, and the first elements of physical mathematics. 
The special branch of education is more practical. Latin and Greek are excluded; 
but it has been thought useful to give to students of this branch of education some 
notions of Greek and Roman history. The teaching comprises French language and 
literature, living languages—German and English —history, geography (and partic- 
ularly commercial geography), physical and natural science (including practical les- 
sons in chemistry, elementary mathematics, and especially mechanical philosophy 
and its most usual application), and commercial accounts and book-keeping. * * * 
The teaching is carried on in the same lycées and colleges as the classical teaching, 
and by special professors. It has been proposed to organize for it special establish- 
ments and this idea is daily gaining ground. 
In order to be registered as a student in the faculty of law, it is necessary to hold 
a degree of bachelier-és-lettres. This degree is obtained after a course of classical 
studies; and the same is required for registration in a faculty of philosophy (lettres); 
but, for registration in a faculty of medicine, a student must be both a bachelier-ds- 
lettres and a bachelier és-sciences. 
To be admitted as a student in a faculty of science, the required degree is that of 
bachelier és-sciences or bachelier de enseignement spécial. 
The latter degree is of recent origin and is far from conferring the privileges which 
public opinion would like to see it endowed with. Thus it does not entitle its holder 
to compete for admission to the government schools, such as the School of St. Cyr, 
the Polytechnic School, and the Ecole Normale Supérieure (higher training school). 
The budgets of lycées and colleges are prepared every year by the head of the estab- 
lishment and successively submitted to the control of a “bureau d@’administration ” 
attached to each “lycée” or college and of the academical council established in 
every academical chief town. They are then approved by the minister of public in- 
struction. 
The expenditure comprises, excluding the expenses for board and lodging of board- 
ers, the emoluments of the administrative staff; the emoluments of the professors and 
tutors (maitres-répétiteurs), fixed throughout France according to established rules; 
the expenses for appliances (matériel) and teaching generally.

COVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The receipts include roughly (1) the fees paid by the students (these fees are very 
low; in many colleges they do not exceed 60 frances per annum) ; (2) the amounts paid 
for ‘‘ purses” (scholarships) by the towns, the departments, and the state; (3) the 
subsidies granted by the state to the lycées and by the towns to the colleges. These 
subsidies, in the cases of certain lyecées, amount to 100,000 francs per annum. The 
subsidies granted by the state to the communal colleges are much less important; in 
most cases they consist in the payment by the state of the emoluments of one or more 
professors. Every year the French Chambers vote the necessary funds for the main- 
tenance of the lycées and the subsidies to the colleges. 
No lycée or college may be established except by a decree of the President of the Re- 
public, promulgated on the proposition of the minister of public instruction. 
Manual labor is, since 1882, one of the compulsory subjects of primary education. 
It is far from being organized in all the schools, but is organized in most of the large 
towns, and is also taught in the training schools for teachers. A certain number of 
large towns, anticipating the law, established som# years ago apprenticeship and pro- 
fessional schools. In the academical district of Caen there are the apprenticeship 
schools of Rouen and Havre, where pupils remain until they are sixteen or even seven- 
teen years old, and when they leave they have sufficient ability to command wages 
amounting to 4 or 5 franes daily. 
The ministry of commerce has under its direction certain schools of arts and manu- 
factures of great repnte, where a number of able foremen are trained, such as the 
School of Mines of St. Etienne. 
At the head of all are the Polytechnic School, the ablest students of which com- 
pore the body of state engineers; the School of Mines; the School of Bridges and 
ays (Ponts et Chaussées) ; the Central School of Arts and Manufactures, established 
by private initiative but which is now subsidized by the state; and the Conserva- 
toire des Arts et Métiers. 
Certain towns, such as Bordeaux, Lyons, Paris, Rouen, and Havre, have founded, 
with the assistance of private persons, of the departments, and of the chambers of 
commerce, high schools of commerce and industry. 
There is in each department a professor of agriculture, who gives lectures in the 
various cantons and is a professor in the training school for teachers. 
Recently in certain faculties of science a number of ‘stations agronomiques” have 
been established, with laboratories for the analysis of soils and manure, There are: 
also model farms and an Institut Agronomique in France. 
Superior instruction.—At the International Conference on Education, London, 1884, 
the subject of superior instruction in France was presented in a paper by M. Albert 
Dumont (read by M. Buisson). The following is a brief résumé of the subject: 
The establishments for higher education are the faculties which formed part of the 
old universities, viz, theology, law, medicine, science, philosophy, the high schools of 
pharmacy, and the écoles de plein exercice (or schools of complete studies), and pre- 
paratory schools, which teach medicine and pharmacy. Those devoted to the study 
of special sciences, or to science generally, and to higher intellectual culture, are the 
musée, the Collége de France, the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, the observa- 
tories, &c. Then there are special schools, such as the Ecole Normale Supérieure 
(higher training school), the schools of Athens, Rome, and Cairo, the Ecole des 
Chartes, and the School of Eastern Languages, which prepare students for literary or 
scientific professions. The faculties of theology are seven in number, five Catholic 
and two Protestant. Catholic theology : Paris, Bordeaux, Aix, Rouen, and Lyons. 
Protestant: Paris and Montauban. The French faculties have no regular students, 
but only hearers. During the early part of 1883-84 the faculties of Catholic theology 
granted 39 “‘ inscriptions” (registration of students) ; the Protestant theological facul- 
ties, 85 in the same period. There is a faculty of law in every academical chief town ex- 
cept Clermont and Besangon. The facultiesin each academy are as follows: Paris, five 
(school of medicine at Reims); Aix and Marseilles, theology, law, science, philosophy, 
school ‘de plein exercice” (complete studies), of medicine and pharmacy; Besancon, 
science, philosophy, school of medicine; Bordeaux, five faculties; Caen, law, science, 
philosophy, schools of medicine at Caen and Rouen, and of theology at Rouen; Cler- 
mont, science, philosophy, school of medicine; Dijon, law, science, philosophy, school 
of medicine; Douai and Lille, law and philosophy at Douai, science and medicine 
at Lille, schools of medicine at Amiens and Arras; Grenoble, law, science, philoso- 
phy, school of medicine; Lyons, fiye faculties; Montpellier, five faculties, with the

exception of theology; Nancy, the same; Poitiers, law, science, philosophy, school 
of medicine, schools of medicine at Tours and Limoges; Rennes, law, science, phi- 
losophy, school of medicine, school ‘de plein exercice” (complete studies) of medi- 
cine and pharmacy at Nantes, of medicine at Angers; Toulouse, law, science, phi- 
losophy, school of medicine, theology at Montauban; Algiers, high schools of law, 
medicine, science, and philosophy. The number of professors and “agrégés” (sub- 
stitutes to the professors) varies between the maximum, 34 at Paris, and the mini- 
mum, 18, The total number of law students during first half year of 1884 was 5,849. 
The expense incurred by the state for the faculties of law is about 1,700,000 francs. 
According to late accounts the examination fees alone amounted to 1,374,000 francs; 
so the state expenses only amounted to 400,000 francs. 
A law of March 18,1880, decreqad the gratuity of “inscription” (registration). Be- 
fore that date the faculties of law brought into the treasury 1,595,000 francs. 
During the first two-thirds of this century France had only three faculties of medi- 
cine: at Paris, Strasburg, and Montpellier. After 1870 the faculty of Strasburg was 
transferred to Nancy, and other faculties were then established at Lyons (1877), Bor- 
deanx (1878), and Lille (1876). Medicine is also taught in two schools “ de plein exer- 
cice,” where complete studies can be gone through, but where some of the examinations 
only take place, and in sixteen preparatory schools, where students can study for three 
years out of the four required for obtaining the degree of doctor. Three high schools 
of pharmacy have been established at Paris, Montpellier, and Nancy; and pharmacy 
can be learned in all “‘mixte” (dual) faculties and in all schoolsof medicine. There were 
5,386 medical students registered in 1883~’84 in the schools of Paris, Bordeaux, Lille, 
Lyons, Montpellier, and Nancy, and 930 pharmaceutical students in the same cities. 
Including the students of one or the other branch in schools “de plein exercice” and 
preparatory schools, the total of medical students was 6,008, pharmaceutical 1,352, 
thus giving 19 students for every 100,000 inhabitants. The ordinary annual cost of 
teaching medicine and pharmacy is 4,300,000 francs; the amount (last published) 
received for examination fees exceeded 1,000,000 francs. Instruction in medicine 
and pharmacy, therefore, costs about eight’ times as much as the teaching of law. 
The fifteen faculties of science and philosophy report as follows for 188384: 1,090 
students of science, 1,584 of philosophy (lettres). The total number of regular stu- 
dents in science and philosophy is 2,674; and if we add to the science students 480 
students in the Polytechnic, 644 in the Ecole Centrale, and to students of both 
branches 132 students in the Ecole Normale, it will be found that about 3,900 students 
pursue scientific and philosophical branches. The professors, lecturers, agrégés, &c., 
in all the faculties mentioned above are 1,540 in number. 
The expenditures for science were 2,116,945 francs; for philosophy, 1,397,475. The 
ordinary expenses for all faculties (theology included) in 1884 were 9,199,665 francs. 
This does not include buildings, scholarships, and libraries, which amount to more 
than 2,000,000 francs, viz, 500,000 franes for buildings, 720,000 franes for scholarships, 
468,000 francs for libraries, &c. In the faculties of medicine the studies have been 
organized since 1878 so as to give greater scope to practical lessons in chemistry, 
natural philosophy, natural history, physiology, and histology, without interfering 
with the teaching of anatomy, surgery, and especially clinical medicine. In the 
schools of law the history of law and international law have received a large share of 
attention. The optional subjects for obtaining a doctor’s degree have been so modified 
asto give greater freedom to personal tastes and promote personal efforts. It has been 
attempted to link more closely together medicine and science and law and philosophy. 
The aim of the museum is essentially scientific, and the students admitted to lectures 
are trained to make original researches. The lectures embrace organic and inorganic 
chemistry, organography and physiology, comparative anatomy, mammalia and birds, 
reptiles and fishes, articulate animals, annelids, mollusks, zoJphytes, natural philos- 
ophy applied to natural history, geology, mineralogy, vegetable physiology applied

  to agriculture, classification of natural families, cultivation, general physiology, 
paleontology, anthropology, comparative pathology, and drawing applied to natural 
history. 
The Collége de France owes its origin to a wish on the part of Francis I. to give 
facilities for tho teaching of educational subjects which the faculty of arts did not 
recognize. The first professorships were those of Greek and Hebrew; then came 
mathematics, philosophy, and Latin rhetoric. There are now forty different professor- 
ships. The special lectures on philology are attended by a smail number of hearers 
who are real students; likewise, the scientific lectures. The laboratories are small, 
but a plan for enlarging them has been submitted to the Chambers, and is likely to be 
voted. 
The Practical School of High Studies was founded in 1868 and has exercised great 
influence over higher education in France. Its object is to place at the disposal of 
scientists the material means they require to enable them to carry on personal re- 
searches and to train under their immediate supervision a few students desirous of 
devoting themselves to the higher branches of science. The scientific section has 
been amalgamated with the institutions among which it was distributed in 1868. 
The section of philology and history forms an independent institution, and comprises 
the teaching of twenty-eight or thirty subjects. Thevolumes published by the Ecole 
des Hautes Etudes are looked upon as standard works in the scientific world. A 
school of astronomy was founded in Paris two years ago for the training of the staff 
required at the different observatories in France. 
The Ecole Normale Supérieure was founded because it was thought that special 
training was required to qualify professors for the ‘‘lycées” and to prepare candi- 
dates for the professorships in the faculties. The course of studies extends over 
three years. The number of students (science and philosophy) leaving the school 
yearly, after passing successfully the final examination (promotion), varies from 
twenty to twenty-four. The candidates admitted to the section of philosophy come, 
for the greater part, from the Paris ‘“‘lycées,” but the provinces contribute most of 
the students in the section of sciences. 
The schools of Athens, Rome, and Cairo, founded in 1846, 1873, end 1880, respec- 
tively, have for object the study of the history of Greece and Italy during all periods, 
but especially in ancient times, and the study of Egyptian antiquities and of eastern 
languages. There are funds for journeysand explorations. Eighteen or twenty 
students are engaged in these subjects. The school of living eastern languages 
has 21 registered students in learned Arabic, 9 in the vulgar, 9 Persian, 10 for Turk- 
ish, 2 in Malay and Japanese languages, 2 in Armenian, 2 modern Greek, 7in Chinese, 
1 in Japanese, 2 in Annamese, 7 Russian, 5 Servian, 1 Hindustani and Tamul, 4 in geog- 
raphy, history, and legislation of the Mahometanstates, 4 in the same branches for 
the states of the far East, and 2 in the Roumanian tongue. 
The Ecole des Chartes was founded in 1806; instruction commenced in 1822. This 
institution is destined to train paleographists. The course of study extends over three 
years. The number of students in each ‘‘ promotion” is twenty. 
These institutions are under the authority of the ministry of public instruction. 
The budget of the institutions enumerated, including the museum, was 3,634,748 francs, 
the museum and astronomical and meteorological establishments taking over 900,000 
francs each. In Paris the Ecole des Beaux Arts gives literary and historical education. 
The various branches of antiquity may be studied at the Ecole du Louvre. The School 
of Anthropology and the Free School of Political Science (1872) have numerous stu- 
dents. There are also the Polytechnic School, the Central School of Arts and Manu- 
factures, the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, the veterinary schools, the agricultural 
schools, at Grignon and in the provinces, the Agricultural Institute, the Ecole @’A ppli- 
cation de Médecine et de Pharmacie Militaire, the School of Mines, the Ecole des Ponts 
et Chaussées, the High School of Commerce, &c.

  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. — ccIx 
Educational convention.—The Bureau of Education is indebted to Prof. Charles 
A. Joy, PH. D., delegate from the United States, for the following report of the proceed- 
ings of the National Educational Association of France (Ligue frangaise de l’enseigne- 
ment), which held its fourth annual congress at Tours, April 15-18, 1884: 
The convention was opened by an address of welcome from M. Charpentier, mayor. 
The president, Senator Macé, ‘‘ father of the league,” then delivered the opening ad- 
dress, in which he spoke of being thirty-two years a teacher and said that he had 
watched the association from its cradle; he was, in fact, at one time the president, sec- 
retary, treasurer, office boy, and sole member. Senator Macé read a translation of the 
letter of appointment of Professor Joy as delegate, from Hon. John Eaton, Commis- 
sioner of Education, and welcomed the delegate in the name of the convention and of 
the educators of France. The first general meeting closed by the appointment of tem- 
porary chairmen for the six sections, viz: On resolutions, on finance, civil and military 
education, technical education and education of women, food and clothing, and in- 
struction in agriculture. Much stress was laid upon the benefits to be derived from 
teaching military evolution to the children of elementary schools, and it was also 
recommended that military drill be made obligatory in the higher schools for pupils 
over eighteen years of age. The section on technical education presented an able 
report, showing what was being done in other countries and urging the importance 
of beginning some kind of handicraft in the public schools at an early stage. In the 
section on food and clothing the discussions covered the various methods in practice 
by which a plate of soup and, in case of need, some clothing could be furnished to 
school children. Some instruction in agriculture was considered important in public 
schools, and it was recommended to offer prizes for schools where there is a garden or 
vineyard attached. The committee on resolutions reported on various propositions. 
Those agreed to by the convention were substantially as follows: ; 
That regular medical inspection should be made in every school to avoid epidemic 
or contagious diseases and injury to eyesight; that food should be furnished to pu- 
pils coming from a distance; that school savings banks should be encouraged; that 
the teachers should organize local educational societies, to be assisted whenever 
necessary by the parent society; that the idea of individual initiative be encouraged 
in the propagation of the work of education; that, in a republic, the future citizen 
should be taught a knowledge of his rights, a sense of his duty, and a sentiment of 
his responsibility; that in our public schools we know no Catholics, Protestants, 
Jews, believers, or atheists, but only how to raise up good citizens for the country; 
that after having taught the child to love his country he must know how to defend 
it, and hence must have a military training; that the education of woman be pro- 
moted; that technical education and the knowledge of some handicraft be everywhere + 
encouraged; that a knowledge of agriculture and of the laws of nature be taught in 
the schools. 
In a report of the proceedings of the associations M. Emile Jamais gave a slight 
history of the organization of the league. It was formed in April, 1881, and met 
in Paris. Previous to that time numerous societies were scattered over the whole 
country ; now 832 local societies are brought into one body, which is devoted to the 
work of gratuitous, obligatory, lay education by means of public lectures, the cre- 
ation of educational societies, and the establishment of free circulating libraries. 
The association has given a library to every regiment in the army, besides founding 
many circulating libraries; in all more than 5,000,000 books have been purchased. A 
number of manuals of good morals and gentle manners have been prepared, in which 
all dogmatic religion is omitted. The fourth educational congress marked a step for- 
ward in the great revolution sweeping over France.

Educational information from the different German states is very meagre for 
188384, but it is presented as far as reported. 
-or The authorities of the Grand Duchy of Baden held an interesting conference in 1883 
at Carlsruhe, where many questions of importance came under discussion. Among 
them were the weight to be given to classical languages, the failing eyesight of the 
nation, the overburdening of pupils, and the appointment of a school board in con- 
nection with each intermediate school under state control. This last question was 
first discussed in the Baden parliament and voted desirable, as tending to give the 
community an interest in school management as well as to give authoritative utter- 
ance to the various complaints of parents as to overwork, neglect of hygiene, -&c. 
The general tone of the meeting was, however, strongly adverse to its very exist- 
ence, as interfering with the dignity and freedom of the scholastic profession. The 
schoolmasters demanded the concession that the personal relations of the masters 
should be beyond control of the board, that all questions of school discipline should 
be settled by the board of masters, and that the head master should be as a rule chair- 
man of the board. The proposed composition of the board is two members elected 
by the education department and the local authorities, respectively, the head master 
and one other master, and the local physician. It was suggested that the number 
should not exceed seven. 
The higher schools of Baden report as follows: Fourteen complete Gymnasien had 
5,258 pupils in 1884 to 5,062 in 1883, an increase of 4.5 per cent. over 1883 and of 7 
per cent. over 1882. Two Progymnasien (at Tauberbischofsheim and Sérrach) became 
complete Gymnasien in 1883-84. The twelve Gymnasien — at Carlsruhe, Pforzheim, 
Bruchsal, Mannheim, Wertheim, Rastadt, Baden, Offenburg, Lahr, Freiburg, Heidel- 
berg, and Constance—had 191 graduates ready for the universities in 1888 to 163 in 
188°. Only about one-fourth or one-fifth of the students in Gymnasien prepare for uni- 
versity courses. The teachers numbered 314 in 1884 to 308 in 1883. Various changes 
were made in the Realgymnasien, according to decree of January 29, 1884, There 
are now 9-class Realgymnasien and 7-class Realgymnasien, 7-class Realschulen, and 
higher burgher schools. The 7-class Realschulen have no Latin. The higher burgher 
schools are Realmittelschulen with less than seven yearsin the course, and they either 
join in with the course of study in the Realgymnasien or the Realschulen, according 
to the district where they are situated. They are to be fully organized in the year 
1885. The 6-class higher burgher schools (without Latin) in Carlsruhe, Pforzheim, 
‘Heidelberg, Freiburg, and Constance will be, in 1885, 7-class Realschulen. Similar 
changes are noticed in other schools of the duchy. The Realgymnasien of Carlsruhe 
and Mannheim had 853 pupils in 1834 and 51 teachers, while 27 Realgymnasien, which 
from sexta to tertia had courses of study like the higher burgher schools, reported 2,196 
pupils and 250 teachers. The higher burgher schools where no Latin is taught had 
1,693 pupils. A total of 10,010 pupils was reported in 1884 in the schools and Gym- 
nasien mentioned above; in 1883 there were 9,450. During the past five years the 
attendance was as follows: 8,597 (1880), 8,979 (1881), 8,947 (1882), 9,450 (1883), and 
10,010 (1884). At the close of the years in the order named the figures were 7,682, 
7,964, 8,051, 8,403, 9,175, The decrease expressed in per cent. was 11, 12, 10, 11, 8.4,

  Bavaria’s school system was quite fully noticed in the Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1882~’83. Statistics of universities in the winter semester of 1884-’85 
are herewith given: In the university at Munich there were 2,685 students to 2,516 in 
the preceding semester; at Wiirzburg, 1,283 students to 856 remaining at the close 
of the summer of 1884; at Erlangen the commencement of the summer term num- 
bered 720 students and during the term the number stood at 402, to which 355 were 
added in the winter term, making a total of 757, divided among the departments of 
theology, medicine, law, philosophy, dentistry, pharmacy, &c. 
Prussia.—The educational establishments of Prussia, both public and private, aro 
under contro] of the minister of public instruction and ecclesiastical affairs, with local 
supervision for each province. The administration of school funds, provided by the 
state, is under control of the civil government, as is the whole management of the 
lower and elementary schools. The provincial Schulcollegium, under supervision of 
the Ober-Priisident, is responsible for the higher schools, for the general system of in- 
struction and discipline, the proper selection of school books, examination and ap- 
pointment of masters, and the examination of those who leave school for the univer- 
sities. The constitution of 1850 gave all persons liberty to teach or to establish 
schools, providing they had the requisite qualifications. Education is compulsory as 
far as the elementary schools are concerned, but no compulsion exists in reference to 
higher institutions. Every town or community must maintain a school supported by 
the taxes and administered by the local authorities, and all parents are compelled to 
send their children to one of these elementary schools, whether they can pay the school 
fées or not. The higher schools — commercial schools or colleges— are also open to the 
poorer classes, the fee being only about $4.32 a quarter, while reductions are often 
made in cases of poor families. The school age is from 6 to 14 years, and in 1882 
there were 4,339,729 children in the 33,040 elementary schools; teachers, 59,917. This 
averages about 159 pupils per 1,000 inhabitants. There were 196 normal schools, with 
13,705 students ; 549 high schools of all kinds, with 7,333 teachers and 133,753 pupils; 
3 technical high schools, with 162 professors and 1,693 students; also, many indus- 
trial, trade, and special schools. The 10 universities of Prussia reported the follow- 
ing students in the winter semester of 188384: Berlin, 4,635; Bonn, 1,037; Breslau, 
1,479; Gottingen, 1,064; Greifswald, 725; Halle, 1,544; Kiel, 375; Kénigsberg, 909 : 
Marburg, 720; Miinster, 280; total, 12,768, The students in Protestant theology 
(Miinster omitted) numbered 530; in Catholic theology (Bonn, Breslau, and Miinster), 
335; in law, 2,339; in medicine, 2,878; in philosophy, 5,114. ° 
At the Royal Veterinary School in Berlin there were 191 students registered in the 
summer term of 1883 and 255 in the winter term of 1883-84; 34 hearers were in attend- 
ance both terms. At the Easter term of 1883, 72 students came up for examination 
in natural sciences and 42 passed; in the department of veterinary surgery, 48 came 
up and 34 passed. So many students desire to enter this school that a new institution 
has been established, where all can be accommodated, 
Saxony.— A new school law took effect in April, 1873, and since that date the cleri- 
eals have had less to do with-education. The progress made is reported in the sta- 
tistical tables published by the ministry of education in the early part of 1884. In 
the-consideration of these schools the following comparison has been made: In 1875 
there were 1,954 lower (einfache), 117 middle (mittlere), and 11 higher common schools ; in [884 the corresponding numbers stood 1,900, 165, and 17. In 1874 there 
were 4,820 teachers’ positions, 621 being for assistants; in 1884 the number increased 
to 6,717, 1,222 for assistants, or an increase of 39 per cent. The school children num- 
bered 439,616 in 1874, or 95 to a teacher ; in 1884, 531,582, or 79 to a teacher. The max- 
imum number of 120 pupils to a teacher was overstepped in 746 schools in 1874 and in 
420 schools in 1884,. Teachers were better paid in 1884, the average for regular teach- 
ers being 1,668 Mark,! assistants, 881 marks, to 1,492 Mark and 813 Mark in 1874, 
  
1 Mark = 23.8 cents,
-P-A-G-E-212
  COXIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The highest amounts paid teachers were in Dresden and Leipzig, 2,250 marks; in 
Chemnitz, 2,165 Mark; and in Plauen, 1,810 Mark. Other signs of progress were ob- 
servable: the average number of days that each child failed to attend in the regular 
term was 3.13 in the year 1874~75, while in 1883~84 it was only .70 day. This 
shows better discipline and naturally a better system of instruction. Many changes 
have been made in the school buildings, apparatus, &c., in the decade. In 1874, 
of 2,082 schools only 404 had proper apparatus for teaching; in 1884, out of 2,142 
schools there were 1,752 well fitted with appliances for teaching. Of 2,265 school 
buildings in 1884, some 556 were erected between 1874 and 1884 and 454 were 
remodelled, and there are 95 in process of erection. The advanced schools (Fort- 
bildungsschulen) numbered 215 in 1874, with 1,881 pupils, while in 1884 there 
were 7,404 such schools, with 66,576 students attending. All these statements in- 
dicate considerable advancement in educational affairs during the ten years men- 
tioned. 
Deaf-mute instruction in the Prussian dominions shows certain elements of progress 
in the last few years. In 1881 there were 51 institutes for the deaf and dumb, with 
- 801 teachers and 3,629 students. Reports for April, 1884, gave 96 institutions, 463 
teachers, and 3,991 pupils. Twenty-one of these schools were in charge of districts, 
societies, or maintained by private individuals; the others were imperial and provin- 
cial establishments. The districts and provinces represented by such schools were 
East and West Prussia, Berlin, Brandenburg, Pomerania, Posen, Silesia, Saxony, 
Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover, Westphalia, Hesse-Nassau, and the Rhine provinces. 
The first meeting of the Deaf-Mute Teachers’ Association was held in Berlin in 
November, 1884. Delegates were there from different countries, in all about 250 
teachers. 
Schools of domestic economy have recently awakened considerable interest in cer- 
tain parts of Germany, especially in Baden and Wiirttemberg, and various schools 
have been established with the object of training young girls in all domestic duties. 
In Wiirttemberg there are five such establishments; in Baden several courses of in- 
struction in this branch are reported, and a regularly established school at Radolf- 
zell, which would serve as a model for any like institution. At other points cookery 
and dairy schools are reported, but few schools where all household duties are taught. 
Jn 1880 a six-week course in taking care of milk, the dairy, &c., was given at Con- 
stance; in 1882 two similar courses were held in the Grand Duchy of Baden; in 1883 
the same thing was again attempted and with such great success that in the autumn 
of 1883 the school at Radolfzell was started. A week after the commencement there 
were 30 girls present, and soon 124 were numbered, but it was found impossible to admit 
more than 16 persons in the first course. The instruction was partly theoretical and 
partly practical. Lectures were given on the processes of the digestive organs, the 
hest foods for nourishment, the caring for and cooking of materials, heating and light, 
washing, removing spots and cleaning generally, care of kitchen utensils, and gen- 
eral observations regarding health, care of the sick, care of clothing, &c. The prac- 
ijical instruction by female teachers covers cookery, caring for food, woman’s handi- 
work, washing and ironing, and general duties about the house. Male teachers in- 
struct in baking, making of butter and cheese, and in caring for the sick, by a physi- 
cian. The aim of the institution at Radolfzell is to teach country girls all the duties 
of the housekeeper in the most systematic manner possible. The pupils board and 
lodge in the establishment and pay 20 Mark during the course for their lodging, 
but the instruction itself is gratuitous. The course now lasts five months, from 
the first of November through March. At the close of the course an examination 
takes place at which the pupils receive certificates indicating the proficiency dis- 
played.

tion, 4,766,661. 
The following information regarding elementary education is compiled from the 
report of the committee of council on education for the year ending August 31, 1883, 
signed by Lord Carlingford and Mr. Mundella: 
Yay schools.— Number of day schools inspected, 18,540; number of certificated 
teachers, 37,280, with a large number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommoda- 
tion for 4,670,443 scholars; enrolled, 4,273,304; average daily attendance, 3,127,214; 
present on the day of inspector’s visit to their respective schools, 3,705,388. 
In the schools inspected under the code of 1881 (8 months, September to April), 
2,191,955 scholars, having made the requisite number of attendances, were qualified 
to bring grants to their schools, 514,742 (being under 7 years of age) without indi- 
vidual examination and 1,677,213 (above 7) on passing a satisfactory examination in 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the schools inspected under the code of 1883 
the number of scholars whose names had been on the school registers for the last 22 
weeks of the school year was, in infant schools and classes, 294,707; in schools 
and classes for older scholars, 712,678. No-grant was directly payable on the exam- 
ination of the scholars in the infant schools and classes, but 31,093 (being upwards of 
7 years of age) were individually examined in Standards I and II, while the number 
of older scholars presented for examination was 665,279. The returns, therefore, 
for the whole year show that 2,276,014 were actually presented for individual exam- 
ination. Of these, 1,483,269 passed the prescribed test without failure in any one of 
the three subjects. 
These figures show improvement upon the returns for the previous year as follows: 
While the increase of the population during the year is estimated at 1.35 per cent., 
the accommodation has increased by 132,123 school places (or 2.91 per cent.), the 
scholars on the registers by 83,692 (2 per cent.), the average attendance by 112,063 (3.7 
per cent.), and the number of children individually examined by 156,640 (or 7.39 per 
cent.); the local effort which has resulted in this improvement may be measured by the 
continued support derived from voluntary contributions (717,0891. from 267,821 sub- 
scribers) and by an advance in the contributions from rates to the maintenance of 
board schools from 808,1211. to 840,9471. The school pence have risen from 1,585,9281. 
to 1,659,7431. 
Night schools.— Number examined, 932; average attendance of scholars above 12 
years of age, 28,293. 
Training colleges.— Number, 41; attendance, 3,138. 
Income and expenditure.— The total income of day and night schools was 5,829,7811. 
The total cost of maintenance of day and night schools was 5,817,4661. The annual 
government grants to elementary day schools rose in the year fromi 2,393,3941, to 
2,522,5411., or from 15s. 104d. to 16s. 1}d. per scholar in average attendance. The total 
cost of maintenance for each child in average attendance in public schools was 2U. 1s. 
34d.; in voluntary schools, 11. 14s. 103d. 
School accommodation and attendance.— In the year 1870 the aided schools provided 
for 1,878,584 scholars, or 8.75 per cent. of the population. The number provided for 
in 1833 was 4,670,443, or 17.35 per cent. of the population. 
Of this total increase of 2,791,859 school seats, no fewer than 805,257 have been re- 
quired to meet the growth of the population. The rest, or nearly 2,000,000 seats may 
be taken as the measure of the deficiency which existed at the passing of the educa- 
tion act. Says the report: 
The age statistics of the census of 1881 show that 23.73 per cent. of the total popu- 
lation are between 3 and 13 years of age. On the usual assumption that six-sev- 
enths of that population are of the class whose children ought to attend public ele- 
mentary schools, it follows that 20 per cent. of the whole population might be found 
on the registers of our schools. 
After making due allowance for absence on account of sickness, weather, distance 
from school, and other reasonable excuses for irregular attendance, it is generally cal- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214

CCXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION 
culated that school seats should be provided for one-sixth of the total population; 
and these seats ought to be daily occupied. For the estimated population of 1583 
(26,921,703) the returns, therefore, ought to show a provision of 4,486,950 school 
places. The actual supply (4,670,443) is somewhat in excess of this; but it is not 
evenly distributed throughout the country; thus in several counties the seats are not 
equal in number to one-sixth of the population. This occurs either where the inhub- 
itants of the public elementary school class fall below the normal six-sevenths or 
where there has been of late years a large increase in the urban population, whose 
wants have not yet been met by the efforts of the school boards in large towns. 
The deficiency of accommodation appears to be greatestin London. With reference 
; _ to thisit is observed that — 
As the upper and middle classes in London at the time of the census were probably 
somewhat in excess of the ordinary proportion throughout the country, the deficiency 
cannot fairly be taken as the exact measure of the supply still required for the district. 
_ But it certainly points to the necessity of further increasing the present provision, 
more especially when it is borne in mind that the number of children of school age 
in London increases by nearly 12,000 every year. It has been stated, indeed, that 
even at the present rate of increase a new school for 1,000 children ought to be opened 
in London each month, for ten months in the year, to meet the yearly growth of the 
population. 
While with the present population there might be 5,384,341 (1 in 5) on the registers 
and 4,486,950 (1 in 6) in average daily attendance, the returns show only 4,273,304 
children on the registers and 3,127,214 in attendance. 
In other words, for every 100 children of school age for whom some 87 school seats 
have been provided, there are only 79'scholars on the registers and 58 in daily attend- 
ance. , 
It is evident that there might be half a million of scholars more than at present on 
_ the registers of aided schools and a rather larger increase in the average attendance, 
which has risen from 1,152,389 in 1870 to 3,127,214 in 1883, i. e., from 5.5 to 11.62 per 
cent. of the population. 
_ Infants.— Of the day scholars on the registers 416,162 were below 5 and 920,767 be- 
_ tween 5 and 7 years of age. 
The provision which in many districts was specially needed, and has been supplied 
of late years, for the separate accommodation of infants, will, it is to be hoped, ma- 
_ terially increase the number of this class of scholars. The methods of instruction for 
children over and under 7 years of age are very different and cannot be efficiently 
_ carried on in the same room. Every school, therefore, except the very smallest, re- 
quires a separate department for infants; and the code now in force contains special 
provisions for securing that proper arrangements are made for the purpose. Of the 
910,238 infants in average attendance during the past year 625,090 were found ininfant 
schools, 132,793 in the infant classes of mixed schools under schoolmistresses, and as 
_ many as 152,355 in similar classes under male teachers, who, unless assisted by com- 
_ petent female teachers, are obviously quite unsuited for such a charge.

EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXV 
It thus appears that whereas out of 2,276,014 scholars examined as many as 1,140,768, 
being over 10 years of age, ought to have been presented in Standards IV-VU, only 
652,901 were so presented, while 487,867 (or 42.77 per cent,) were presented in stand- 
ards suited for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
There has been, however, a gradual improvement in this respect, which is due 
partly to the more regular attendance and increased proficiency of the children be- 
tween 5 and 10 years of age and partly to the greater attention paid by teachers to 
the progress of individual scholars. 
Class subjects and specific subjects.—The grants on examination in class subjects, de- 
pending upon the general proficiency of the classes and not of individual scholars, were 
made for the first eight months of the past year under the code of 1881, in respect of 
an average attendance of 1,409,027 scholars, of whom 1,169,329 were paid for passes in 
two subjects, the amount claimed being 251,9501. Geography was taken in 9,748 de- 
partments, grammar in 12,364, history in 834, and needlework in 5,720. Children were 
examined in other subjects in 4 departments only, the subjects being animal physi- 
ology, chemistry, domestic economy, and natural history. 
Under the code of 1883 the choice of subjects has been somewhat more restricted, 
English being compulsory if any subject istaken. Grants have been made in respect 
of an average attendance of 565,947 scholars in 5,501 departments, and refused in 210 
departments with an average attendance of 13,358. The first class subject, English, 
was taken in 5,711 departments, and the grant at the rate of 1s. (for a fair report) was 
claimed on an average attendance of 158,362 scholars, and at the higher rate of 2s. (for 
a good report) on 381,471. 
A second class subject was taken in 4,370 departments, and the grant at the rate of 
1 shilling paid to an average attendance of 124,125 scholars, while 366,750 were paid 
at the rate of 2 shillings. New subjects under the head of elementary science were 
taken to a very limited extent (in 15 departments only); geography was taken in 
3,988; history, in 114; and needlework, by the girls in 1,644 departments. 
Grants for ‘specific subjects” were paid under the code of 1881 during the first eight 
months of the year, the number of scholars examined in the same for that period being 
139,604, of whom 104,022 passed successfully, 37,651 of them in two subjects and 874 
in three subjects. 
By the code of. 1883, under which the examinations were made for the last four 
months of the year, the presentation of children in specific subjects is confined to , 
Standard V and upwards, and not more than two subjects are allowed to be taken by 
any scholar. The returns show that 19,658 scholars were examined and 13,624 passed. 
without failure, 4,288 of them in two subjects. 
Miscellaneous.— Military drill is systematically taught to the boys attending 1,108 
day schools. Cookery is taught in 420 schools, or in 73 more than in 1882. Savings 
banks have been established in 1,718 and school libraries in 3,046 schools. In 27,236 
departments of schools in which singing is taught, the instruction is given by ear in 
21,743, 
Trained teachers.— The extent to which the training colleges have contributed to the 
present supply of efficient teachers in England and Wales is shown by the fact that, 
of 15,368 masters employed in schools reported on last year, 9,353, or 60.86 per cent., 
had been trained for two years; 1,020, or 6.64 per cent., for one-year ; and 225, or 1.46 
per cent., for less than one year; while 4,770, or 31.04 per cent., were untrained. In 
like manner, of 21,912 school mistresses, 9,379, or 42.80 per cent., had been trained for 
two years; 992, or 4.53 per cent., for one year; 203, or .93 of 1 per cent., for less than one 
year; and 11,338, or 51.74 per cent., were untrained. Of the teachers, however, who, 
from whatever cause, have not attended a training college, a considerable proportion 
cannot, except in a technical sense of the word, be classed as untrained, having, under 
the superintendence of some of the best teachers, passed through the pupil teachers’ 
course and served as assistants in large schools before passing the examination for a 
certificate and undertaking independent charges.

  COXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Proportion of female teachers.—In 1869, for every 100 teachers of each class, 48 certifi- 
cated teachers, 60 assistant teachers, and 57 pupil teachers were females; these pro- 
portions have increased im i882 to 59 certificated teachers, 68 assistant teachers, and 71 
pupil teachers. 
The number of female pupil teachers in 1869 was 7,273; they now number 18,725, 
an increase of 157 per cent. The male pupil teachers, who numbered 5,569 in 1869, 
have increased to 7,703, or by about 38 per cent. 
Salaries and pensions.—The average salary of a certificated master, which in 1870 
was 951, 128. 9d., is now 1191.; that of a schoolmistress was 571. 16s, 5d. in 1870, 
_and is now 721, 1s, 9d. In addition to their other emoluments, 6,138 out of 14,827 
masters, and 5,317 out of 21,270 mistresses, are provided with residences free of rent. 
These averages are calculated upon the whole of the certificated teachers, whether 
principal or assistant. 3 
During the half year ending at Michaelmas, 183, applications for pensions were 
made on behalf of 63 teachers in England and Wales, and 2 pensions of 257. and 4 of 
201., together with 7 gratuities to the amount of 2001., were awarded. 
Since the practice of granting pensions was resumed in 1875 the department has 
dealt with 735 English applications. Sixteen pensions of 301., 110 of 251., 163 of 201., 
and 72 gratuities to the amount of 2,6607. have been awarded. 
There were at Michaelmas, 1883, 270 teachers to whom pensions had been granted 
in England and Scotland, of whom 20 had 30/., 100 had 252., and 150 had 201. a year, 
The full number of pensions allowed to be borne on the estimates has, therefore, been 
filled up. 7 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF LONDON. 
School accommodation.—From the annual statement of the chairman of the school 
board, Mr. Edward North Buxton, for the year ending September, 1884, it appears that 
the board had under their charge 367 board schools, accommodating 328,683 children, 
being an increase of 21,349 school places during the year. The accommodation in vol- 
untary schools was 263,197 places, making a total accommodation of 591,880 school 
places. According to the most recent estimates, the number of children for whom 
places should be provided is 662,346. In view of the deficiency of above 70,000 places, 
Mr. Buxton says: ‘“‘It would therefore seem that we can hardly yet boast of being 
within measurable distance of overtaking the deficiency which has taxed our ener- 
gies for the last fourteen years.” 
Enrolment and aitendance.—The enumeration for the half year ending midsummer, 
1884, presented in the report of the by laws committee, shows an enrolment in board 
and voluntary schools of 561,266 pupils and an average attendance of 448,838, the ac- 
commodation at the same date being 587,593. As compared with 1871, these figures 
show an increase of 325,334, or 124 per cent., in the number of school places; 338,748, 
or 152.2 per cent., in enrolment, and 274,537, or 157.5 per cent., in the average attend- 
ance. 
From the same report it appears that in December, 1883, the accommodation re- 
quired, according to the statistical committee, was 613,282; the accommodation pro- 
vided in board and voluntary schools, 568,236; the average number on tho rolls, 
557,562 ; the average attendance, 439,858. The percentage of average attendance, 
estimated upon the average number on the rolls, was 78.8. It will be seen that for 
the half year ending midsummer, 1884, the corresponding percentage was raised to 80. 
“The fact,” says Mr. Buxton, ‘that our average attendance is only 80 per cent. 
may well stimulate the ambition of our painstaking visitors to accomplish even better 
results.” ; 
Examinations.—The new code weut into operation May 1, 1883. The results of 
the government examinations in 117 schools examined under this code, the reports 
on which are for a period of exactly one year, show the following percentages of 
passes: Reading, 92.3; writing, 87.7; arithmetic, 84.8. The percentage of passes

in reading is higher than for three previous years and lower in writing and arith- 
metic. . 
Overpressure.—With reference to the subject of overpressure, which has been so 
widely agitated during the year, Mr. Buxton observes: 
Although much exaggeration has been found to have been used and some of the 
eases which were made public attributed to overwork which were obviously due to 
other causes, the precautions taken by the school management committeo and the 
measures adopted by the board show that they are fully alive to the necessity of 
guarding against the injurious results of undue mental pressure. The alteration of 
which I have already spoken, from part payment by grant to fixed salaries, will 
remove one active cause of mental worry. Another important step lies in the sub- 
stitution, in part, of adult for pupil teachers. The extent to which this transfer is 
taking place is shown by the fact that, whereas in 1881 the number of adult teachers 
was 3,356 to 1,471 pupil teachers and candidates, in 1883 there were 4,087 of the former 
to 1,496 of the latter. Experience shows that it is in the earlier years of their career . 
that the danger to the teachers is greatest, especially during the period when, as pupil 
teachers, they add to their class duties the strain and anxiety of preparing for their 
own examinations. It is as much our duty to economize the time of the children and 
their capacity for learning as to be caretul of the money with which we are intrusted; 
and it is not too much to say that both are squandered when we set pupil teachers, 
whose energy is exhausted in acquiring knowledge, to instruct children not much 
younger than themselves. With a view to avoiding this injurious result, the com- 
mittee have prepared a scheme under which candidates and junior pupil teachers, 
instead of attending their respective schools in the morning and afternoon of each day 
and the central classes for their instruction on two evenings and on Saturday morn- 
ings, will attend the latter on one-half of each school day. The committee have 
further determined that during this period they should not be counted on the teach- 
ing staff. The seniors are also to be relieved from teaching on two half days in each 
week. 
With regard to overpressure on children, which some believe to exist, no orte is so 
much concerned as we are to avoid any approach to it. Not only would it be injuri- 
ous to the physical health of the children, but it would be the most short sighted 
policy from an educational point of view. The board do not need to be reminded 
that no greater hindrance to educational progress could be devised than a time table 
beyond the capacity of children. The board have carefully examined into those 
cases which have been brought forward, some of them of a very sensational char- 
acter, but have failed to find any propf of mischief, except of occasional want of 
judgment of teachers in individual cases. 
Physical training.—Much attention continues to be paid to the physical training of 
the children, and a special subcommittee has charge of it. 
A Swedish gymnasium has been erected at the Crampton street (Walworth) 
school, and the services of Captain Haasum, of the Swedish Life Guards, have been 
secured for six months for the purpose of giving instruction in the Swedish system 
of gymnastics. Classes have been held under Captain Haasum at three centres, which 
have been attended by about 200 teachers. At Crampton street, the teachers have, 
of course, had the advantage of the gymnastic apparatus that has been put up. 
Captain Haasum has also established a class for boys from the Marlborough street 
school, and he has used this class for the purpose of illustrating his system at the In- 
ternational Health Exhibition. 
The reports of the instructor in drill and of the superintendent of the physical edu- 
cation of girls show improvement in both of these departments. 
Infant schools.—The superintendent of method in infant schools calls attention to 
the need of a greater variety and better adaptation of exercises for children between 
3 and 5 years of age, The time spent by these young children in repeating and writ- 
ing the letters of the alphabet is shown to be excessive. Evening classes have been 
formed for the purpose of instructing the teachers of infant schools in approved 
methods of training young children. 
Cookery.—About 12,000 girls received the instruction in cookery during the year. 
Thirty-two cookery class rooms have been built by the board at an average cost of 
2701. The cost of materials during the past year was 3951. 7s. 4d. and 3891. 8s. 7d. 
were realized by the sale of the food prepared. 
The number of blind children reported on the rolls March 21, 1884, was 130, These

receive instruction in special classes. During the half year 8 of the children gained 
a ccuelatetitns at the Primary School of the Royal Normal College for the Blind. 
The number of deaf and dumb children reported was 224, with an average attend- 
_ ance of 155. The superintendent observes: 
The periodical examinations show that most satisfactory progress is made where 
sufficient accommodation and teaching power are provided, but the peculiar nature 
of the work is such that where these are wanting good results in the oral system can- 
not be expected. 
Teaching force.—The following table shows the teaching staff employed by the board 
_ in March, 1883, and March, 1884:

With reference to teachers’ salaries, Mr. Buxton states: 
The long delayed but much needed improvement of substituting in the case of our 
teachers inclusive salaries on a fixed scale, prepaid monthly, for the system of part 
payment by the government grant has at length been adopted. The difficulty that 
had to be surmounted was so to adjust this scale as to avoid causing individual cases 
of hardship without laying an additional burden on the ratepayers — of reconciling 
vested interests with the desire not to increase the gross amount of salaries. Since 
the beginning of the year all new teachers entering the service of the board have 
come under the new scale, and the salaries of teachers previously in our schools are 
now being commuted on an equitable system. 
Free schools.— The complications arising from the endeavor to collect school fees 
and the inability of many parents to pay fees have led from time to time to proposi- 
tions for the establishment of free schools. A motion for this purpose was rejected 
by the board during the year, the vote standing 26 to 12. 
Mr, Buxton presents the following statement of finances: 
Our total estimated expenditure chargeable to the rates for the current year is 
950,8047. 5s. This shows an increase of about 1d. in the pound over last year. The 
following table, covering 5 years, affords ready means of comparing this increase with 
the growth of the rate. It will be seen that, while the children have multiplied dur- 
ing that period by 39.9 per cent., the rate has grown by 27.4 per cent.

From this it will be seen that the increased charge upon the ratepayers does not 
arise from a higher scale of expenditure, but because we have more nearly approached 
toa complete school provision for London, and_because these new schools are filled 
with children. The net cost per child for school maintenance for the year ended 25th 
March, 1883, was 1. 13s. 9d., as compared with 10. 11s, 11d. for the year ended 25th 
March, 1884. 
The ayerage weekly fee charged in the schools of the board remains the same as in 
1883, viz, 2.2d.1

b. ScorLaND: Population, 3,866,521. Capital, Edinburgh ; population, 236,002. 
  The following information is compiled from the report of the committee of council 
on education in Scotland for the year 1883, signed by Lord Carlingford and Mr. Mun- 
della: * 
Day schools.—Number of day schools inspected, 3,090; number of certificated teach- 
ers, 5,974, with a large number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommodation for 
633,701; enrolled, 569,241; average daily attendance, 433,137; present on the day of 
the inspector’s visit to the respective schools, 498,514; qualified by attendance for 
examination, 426,329; presented for examination, 386,197, viz, 55,491 (under 7) for 
collective and 330,706 (7 and over) for individual examination ; of these last, 256,083 
passed the prescribed test without failure in any one of the three subjects. 
In the year covered by this report the accommodation has increased by 14,615 
school places; the scholars on the registers, by 13,581; those present at inspection, by 
8,142; and the average attendance, by 11,872; while the number of children individ- 
ually examined has increased by 9,956 (or 3.10 per cent.). The especially large in- 
crease in the amount of accommodation and in the number of children on the registers 
is due in some measure to the number of new schools in the outlying districts of the 
Highlands and islands, where the supply has, owing to various circumstances, pro- 
ceeded but slowly, and where several schools have only been opened during the year 
under review. 
The local effort which has resulted in this improvement may be measured by the 
continued support derived from voluntary subscriptions (29,1967. from 3,391 sub- 
seribers) and by the contributions from rates to the maintenance of public schools, 
which, after a decrease during the three preceding years, have increased during the 
past year from 191,7971. to 196,7081. The school pence have increased in the year 
by some 7,2041., and amounted to 276,422. 
Night schools.—Number examined, 205; average attendance of scholars above 12 
years of age, 10,221. 
Training colleges.— Number, 7; attendance, 858, 
Income and expenditure.—The total income of day and night schools was 906,068. 
The total cost of maintenance of day and night schools was 900,509. The annual gov- 
ernment grants to elementary day schools rose in the year from 372,9011. to 384,0427. 
The rate per scholar in average attendance, however, is the same as last year, 17s. 84d., 
the grant (to schools actually inspected) and the average attendance having increased 
at the same rate during the year. The total cost of maintenance per child in average 
attendance was, in public schools, 27. 2s. 12d.; in voluntary schools, 11. 16s. 103d. 
School accommodation and atiendance.— The aided schools, which in 1872 provided for 
281,668 scholars, or for 8.3 per cent. of the population, were in 1883 sufficient for 
633,701 scholars, or 16.61 per cent. of the population. 
Of the total increase of 352,013 seats, some 69,961 have been required to meet the 
growth of the population during the last 11 years. A very large part of the rest of 
this increase (according to the calculation made last year, upwards of 274,000) is the 
measure of the deficiency in inspected schools at the passing of the education act. 
It remains to notice how far the existing school supply (633,701 seats) which has 
been thus provided, and shows an increase of 124.98 per cent. in the last 11 years, is 
sufficient to meet the wants of the country. 
The age statistics of the census of 1881 show that about 23.96 per cent. of the total 
population are between 3 and 13 years ofage. On the usual assumption that six- ~ 
sevenths of that population are of the class whose children may be expected to be 
found in state-aided schools, it follows that 20.52 per cent. of the whole population 
ought to be found on the registers of the schools, 
After making due allowance for absence on account of sickness, weather, distance 
from school, and other reasonable excuses for irregular attendance, it is generally 
calculated that school seats should be provided for one-sixth of the total population ;
-P-A-G-E-220
COXxX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  and these seats ought to be daily occupied. For the estimated population of 1883 
(3,815,572) the returns, therefore, ought to show a provision of 635,929 school places. 
The actual supply falls somewhat short of this; but it is not evenly distributed 
throughout the country, and in several counties the seats are not equal in number to 
one-sixth of the population. This occurs either where that extent of accommoda- 
tionis not called for, the inhabitants of the upper classes being in excess of the normal 
one-seyenth, or where, as in one or two large towns, the wants of the population 
have not yet been fully met by the efforts of the school boards. 
When the outstanding building grants have been paid and several schools now in 
the course of being erected without such aid are occupied, it will be found, the com- 
mittee believe, that the school supply of the country is virtually complete. 
School attendance is still far below the required number, for, whereas there might 
be 763,114 scholars on the registers and 635,929 in average daily attendance, the re- 
turns show only 569,241 children on the registers and 433,137 in attendance. 
The increase in the average attendance during the past year is fairly satisfactory, 
as it is slightly in excess of that (1.06) of the population generally. But, after every 
allowance is made for the difficulty of securing early and regular attendance at school 
in some of the country districts, there appears to be great neglect on the part of many 
boards in putting their compulsory powers into operation. 
A bill introduced into Parliament last year with a view of facilitating the exercise 
of the compulsory powers conferred upon school boards has become a law. 
Infants.— Of the total number of children enrolled in the aided schools 118,385 were 
under 7 years of age. 
Scholars over 7 years of age.— The following table shows the classification of children 
over 7 for each standard:

Whereas, out of 330,706 scholars examined, as many as 1€4,231, being over 10 years 
of age, ought to have been presented in standards IV-VI, only 118, 664 (or 72.25 per 
cent.) were so presented, while the remaining 45,567 were presented in standards 
suited for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
Specific subjects.—Of 58,546 scholars presented in subjects beyond the standard 
examination, 4,275 were examined and 3,225 passed in three subjects, 34,675 were 
examined and 24,752 passed in two such subjects, and 23,425 passed in one subject. 
In this number are included 25,260 girls examined in domestic economy, of whom 
20,457 passed. 
Miscellaneous.— Military, drill is systematically taught to the boys attending 265 
schools; cookery is taught in 36 schools; savings banks have been established in 113 
and school libraries in 153 schools. In 3,116 departments of schools in which singing 
is taught, the instruction is given by ear in 1,238, or 39.73 per cent. 
Teaching power.—The extent to which the training colleges have contributed to the 
existing supply of certificated teachers in Scotland is shown by the fact that, of 3,295 
masters employed in schools reported on last year, 2,026, or 61.49 per cent., had been 
trained for two years; 327, or 9.92 percent., for one year, and 83, or 2.52 per cent., for
-P-A-G-E-221

Jess than one year; while 859, or 26.07 per cent., were untrained. In like manner, of 
2,679 schoolmistresses, 1,838, or 68.61 per cent., had been trained for two years; 122, 
or 4.55 per cent., for one year; 12, or .32 of 1 per cent., for less than one year; and 707, 
or 26.39 per cent,, were untrained. Of the teachers, however, who, from whatever 
cause, have not attended atraining college, aconsiderable proportion cannot, except 
in a technical sense of the word, be classed as untrained, having, under the superin- 
tendence of some of the best teachers, satisfactorily completed the pupil teachers’ 
course and served as assistants in large schools before passing the examination for a 
certificate and undertaking independent charges. 
The system introduced by the code of 1873, of combining attendance at university 
classes with the efficient course of practical professional training provided by the col- 
Jeges under inspection, is now producing very satisfactory results. In 1882, 117 stu- 
dents took advantage of this arrangement, many of whom passed with great credit 
the examination for certificates held last Christmas. The connection between the 
teaching profession and the universities will be still further increased by the recog- 
nition as assistant teachers of university graduates and women who have passed 
university examinations. Languages now enter into the course of study in all the 
training colleges, both for masters and mistresses. 
Salaries and pensions.—The average salary of a certificated master, which in 1870 
was 1101. 16s. 7d., is now 1351. 28. 4d.; that of a schoolmistress was 551. 14s, 2d. in 
1870 and is now 671. 1s. 1d. These averages are calculated upon the whole body of 
certificated teachers, whether principal or assistant. In addition to their other 
emoluments, 1,806 out of 3,279 masters and 489 out of 2,635 mistresses are provided 
with residences free of rent. Since the practice of granting pensions was resumed 
in 1875, the department has dealt with 123 Scotch applications and. has awarded 5 
pensions of 301., 19 of 251., 26 of 201., and 19 gratuities to the amount of 6801. 
¢. IRELAND: Population (census 1881), 5,174,836. Capital, Dublin ; population (census 1881), 249,602. 
From the report of the commissioners of national education in Ireland, it appears 
that the number of schools on the operation list on the 31st of December, 1883, was 
7,752. During the year 110 schools were dropped or ceased to exist as independent 
schools, and 157 were brought into operation, yee net increase of 47 schools as 
compared with 1882. 
Enrolment, attendance, and, accommodation.— The number of pupils on the rolls be- 
tween the 1st of January and the 31st of December, 1883, who made any attendance 
between those dates was 1,081,136; the number of pupils who made at least one 
attendance within the last fortnight of the results period was 666,115; the average 
daily attendance was 467,704, a decrease of 1,488 as compared with that of 1882. 
School accommodation, allowing 8 square feet for each pupil, was adequate for an 
attendance of 671,109. 
Classification of pupils.— The pupils who made an attendance within the last 14 
days of the month immediately preceding results examinations were classified as 
follows: Infants, 171,183 ; class I, 143,785; class II, 104,678; class III, 85,724; class 
IV, 63,814; class V!, 44,868; class V2, 25,000; class VI, 27,063. 
Mixed schools.— The total number of mixed schools under Roman Catholic teachers 
exclusively was 2,784, attended by 359,297 Roman Catholic pupils and 22,698 Protes- 
tant pupils; the total number of mixed schools under Protestant teachers exclusively 
was 1,277, attended by 22,604 Roman Catholics and 126,415 Protestant pupils. The 
number of mixed schools under Roman Catholic and Protestant teachers conjointly 
was 73, attended by 9,320 Roman Catholic pupils and 9,266 Protestant pupils. Total 
mixed schools, 4,134; total attendance: Roman Catholic pupils, 391,221; Protestant 
pupils, 158,379. 
Unmixed schools.— Of 3,549 schools showing an unmixed attendance, 2,929 were in

COXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
charge of Roman Catholic teachers and attended by 460,505 Roman Catholic pupils, 
and 620 were in charge of Protestant teachers and attended by 70,737 pupils. 
Model schools.— The number of model schools reported is 29, having an average daily 
attendance for the year of 8,534 pupils. From the classified table of pupils of the 
model schools it appears that 51.4 per cent. of them are in Standards IV to VI, inclu- 
the results examinations show that these schools continue to maintain their 
high character. 
Workhouse schools.—The number of workhouse schools in connection with the board 
on the 31st of December, 1883, was 159, having an enrolment of 14,026 and an average 
daily attendance of 7,368. These schools were examined on the same system as the 
ordinary schools. 
Examinations.— Since the 1st of March, 1877, each pupil, in order to qualify for 
presentation at the results examination, has been required in day schools to make 100 
attendances of at least 4 hours a day for secular instruction, and in evening schools 
50 attendances of 2 hours each evening. 
The total number of schools, including model schools (separate departments) and 
evening schools, examined for results during the year was 7,672. The number of 
pupils examined was 475,784, of whom 106,928 were infants. The number passed was 
356,214, including 98,241 infants. The number of pupils examined and passed in ex- 
tra subjects was: Music, examined, 52,429; passed, 41,256. Drawing, examined, 
23,545; passed, 18,085. Sewing machine and cutting out, examined, 4,558; passed, 
3,977. Management of poultry and domestic economy, examined, 190; passed, 178. 
Cookery, examined, 142; passed, 142. Other extra subjects, mathematics, physics, 
language, &c., examined, 20,604; passed, 12,924. The money value of the passes 
gained in extras (excluding music and dancing) was 4,0381. 18s. The money value 
of the passes in music and drawing was 7,0981. 5s. 6d. 
Comparative view.—The percentages of passes gained in reading, writing, and arith- 
metic in Ireland, as compared with England and Wales and with Scotland, are set 
forth in the following table:

School farms and gardens.—The total number of school farms in connection with 
ordinary national schools on the 31st of December, 1883, was 72. The total number of 
pupils examined in agriculture in this class of schools was 884, of whom 518 passed in 
the agricultural program. There were also 21 schools having school gardens at- 
tached, for the management of which and for the agricultural knowledge displayed 
by the pupils, special agricultural fees were granted upon the reports of the district 
inspectors. The number of pupils examined in the school gardens was 249, of whom 
160 passed; 45,673 pupils were examined in the agricultural class books by the dis- 
trict inspectors in the ordinary national schools at their results examinations, of 
whom 24,876 passed. The total number of pupils examined in agriculture during the 
year 1883 was accordingly 46,806, of whom 25,554 gained passes for their proficiency 
inthat branch. These figures show that a larger number of pupils were brought under 
instruction in agriculture in 1883 than in 1882. 
Dairy management.— At the close of the year 1880 a scheme for training young 
women in dairy management, and especially in the art of butter making, was inaugu-
-P-A-G-E-223
         EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, CCXXUI 
rated in connection with the Munster Model Agricultural School at Cork. This scheme 
has been attended with much success, largely due to the active codperation of a local 
committee, who contributed time and money to its furtherance. There were two ses- 
sions of six weeks in each year. . The number of young women trained up to this date 
is 189. The students were principally daughters of farmers. 
Towards the end of the year 1883 the commissioners undertook, with the codpera- 
tion of the Royal Dublin Society, a similar experiment at the Albert Agricultural 
Training Institution. The session began in January of this year, and, although the 
notice was short, 33 students attended. 
Teaching power.—On the 31st of December, 1883, the commissioners had in their 
service 7,571 principal teachers and 3,050 assistants, making, in the whole, 10,621 
classed teachers, of whom 3,406 were trained. In addition there were paid monitors, 
temporary assistants, &c., to the number of 386. 
The total number of teachers and students trained in the Training College in 1883 
was 167, viz, 78 males and 89 females. 
The need of additional provision for the training of the teachers is seen from the fact 
that of the 7,907 Roman Catholic teachers in the service January, 1883, only 2,142, or 
about 27 per cent., had been trained, and of the 2,714 Protestant teachers 1,412, or 52 
per cent. 
In 1874 the subject was brought to the attention of the government by the com- 
missioners, but no action was taken upon their representations until 1683. It was 
then proposed to apply the English scheme of training colleges to Ireland, so far as 
possible, which proposition the commissioners have accepted. Accordingly the gov- 
ernment is now prepared to encourage and facilitate the establishment of training col- 
leges under local management in Ireland by authorizing the commissioners to make 
grants toward their maintenance under the specified conditions. Two training colleges 
under Catholic auspices have already availed themselves of this provision. The Irish 
teachers suffer a great grievance in the low rate of wages which they receive. 
The total income of the teaching staff from all sources for the year ended 31st 
of March, 1884, amounted to 752,912I. 88. 6d., viz, 601,2241. 19s. 7d. from the board, 
14,4031. 15s. 2d. from the rates, and 137,2831, 13s. 9d. from payments by pupils (includ- 
ing portion of model school fees), subscriptions, and the estimated value of free resi- 
dences, &c. Of the total sum 20.1 per cent. was locally provided and 79.9 per cent. 
was derived from parliamentary funds. 
Pensions.—The number of teachers connected with the pension fund in the year 
ended the 3lst December, 1883, was 9,604, and the amount paid in pensions was 
12,2121. 11s. 4d., and in gratuities 7,1531. 128. 5d. 
In addition e the above sum 1,6851. 15s. 5d. were granted to teachers who did not 
join the pension scheme. 
Income and expenditure.—The funds at the disposal of the commissioners for the year 
ending 31st March, 1884, amounted to 821,5531. 6s. 8d. The expenditures by the com- 
missioners for the same time were 804,8911. 17s., leaving a balance on 31st March, 1884, 
of 16,6611. 98. 8d. 
SCIENCE AND ART DEPARTMENT. 
The following information is derived from the thirty-first report of the Science and 
Art Department, whose operations embrace the United Kingdom: 
Science instruction.— During the year 1883, the schools and classes of science in con- 
nection with the department, irrespective of the training colleges, were attended by 
72,054 persons, an increase of 3,473 over the same for 1882. The number examined 
was 54,204; the number of papers presented (each paper being the examination in a 
separate branch of science), 79,551; number passed, 52,651, representing 32,767 stu- 
dents.

The payments to the training colleges on the results of the examination amounted 
to 5,0291. 88. 6d., or an average of 11. 16s. 5d. per pupil under instruction. 
The total number of students under instruction in the Normal School of Science and 
Royal School of Mines was 212. The attendance at the several classes was as follows: 
Chemistry, 93; physics, 28; mechanics, 39; metallurgy, 43; biology (including bot- 
any), 19; geology (including mineralogy), 34; and mining, 30. 
The number of teachers in training was 12 in chemistry, 14 in physics, 11 in me, 
chanics, 8 in biology, 9 in geology, 4 in metallurgy, 8 in agriculture, and 4 in mining- 
In addition to the ordinary sessional courses, the summer courses for country teach- 
ers, which last three weeks, are a most important part of the work of the school. In 
1883 there were such courses in chemistry, light and sound, mechanism, botany, geol- 
ogy, agriculture, and agricultural chemistry. These courses, which consisted of lect- 
ures and laboratory practice specially adapted to the particular class of students, 
were attended by 189 teachers. 
The Royal College of Science, Dublin, was attended by 59 persons. 
Art instruction.— The number of elementary day schools examined for drawing under 
the regulations of the Science and Art Department was 4,526, or about 25 per cent. of 
the whole number of schools inspected by the education department. The payments 
made to the schools on account of drawing amounted to 28,3341. 4s. 3d. and the cost 
of prizes and examples to 3,3651. 178, 10d., or a total expense of 31,7001. 2s. 1d. 
At the examination of 48 training colleges in November, 3,476 students in training 
and 828 teachers and pupil teachers of elementary schools were examined, and 819 
of these candidates obtained full certificates for second grade drawing. The total 
amount granted to the colleges on the results of the examinations was 1,2461. 
The department also gives aid to art classes, which in 1883 numbered 499, having 
26,424 students. For advanced art instruction, there were 177 schools, with 15 branch 
classes, having in all 35,909 students. 
The National Art Training School was attended by 710 students, of whom 34 were 
in training to become art teachers and 17 to become designers or art workmen. The 
Dublin Metropolitan School of Art was attended by 506 students. The grand total of 
persons taught drawing, painting, or modelling through the agency of the department

The total number of visitors to the South Kensington Museum during the year was 
1,093,810, and to the Bethnal Green Branch, 447,752. In accordance with the policy 
adopted in 1880 of granting loans to corporation museums, 16,021 art objects, drawings, 
and pictures were sent out from the museum during the year, and the exhibitions in 
which they were placed were visited by 2,572,000 people. 
During the year, the department was induced to take some steps toward develop- 
ing and improving the lace making industry in Ireland, As a result of these efforts, 
a special class for lace designing has been organized at the Cork School of Art, and 
the school has opened direct relations with two or three of the convents in the neigh- 
borhood with the view of giving instruction in drawing and of supplying designs to 
be worked. 
The committee of the School of Art has applied for aid in the purchase of a collec- 
tion of ancient laces, the intention being to form a local industrial art museum.

population, 63,374. Minister of the interior, C. Lombardos. 
Special inetruction.—A bill for the reorganization of the Polytechnic School was pro- 
posed by the minister of the interior on December 8, 1884, The old organization 
which existed since 1863 was felt to be inadequate to modern requirements as far 
as positive sciences are concerned. The object of the new organization is to provide 
a systematic course of instruction to train students in the mechanical arts. The 
name of the institution is the School of Biomechanical Arts, which means those 
mechanical arts which are used in the daily affairs of life, and the graduates of the 
school are expected to be practically qualified to take positions in the public service 
or in business where a knowledge of such arts is required. The reorganized scheme 
ecemen preparatory gymnasium and special schools or courses of civil and me- 
chanical engineering, &c. 
Superior instruction.—The report of the university for the forty-fourth scholastic year 
shows that in the year 1582~83 there were 655 new students and 1,946 already en- 
rolled, making a total of 2,601. Of the new admissions 507 were from the Kingdom 
of Greece, 144 from other Greek communities, and 4 from other countries. They 
were distributed among the different faculties as follows: The theological faculty — 
received 6, the law 343, the medical 172, the philosophical 123, and the pharmaceu- 
tical 11, The number of graduates during the year 1882~83 was 342. Since 1837, 
when the university was established, 11,283 persons have been educated in its differ- 
ent faculties: 360 for the theological, 4,730 for the law, 3,600 for the medical, 2,130 
for the philosophical, and 473 for the pharmaceutical. The medical faculty had a 
majority at first; during the third decade the law faculty led in numbers; during 
the fourth decade the two faculties were nearly equal in that respect, and at present 
the law faculty is again in advance.

part of 1884), then Signior Coppino, 
The central bureau of statistics of Italy publishes the following educational items 
for 1881-82, There were 2,516 infant schools, both public and private, taught by 123 
men and 106 women; number of pupils, 243,972. The public and private primary 
schools numbered 47,220, with 1,976,135 pupils (1,053,917 boys and 922,218 girls), 
Evening schools for adults had 248,012 pupils; Sunday schools, 122,107 in attendance. 
There were 77 higher schools for girls, with 3,559 attending; 111 normal and “ mag- 
istral” schools, with 8,221 pupils (1,319 male pupil teachers and 6,912 female pupil 
teachers). The number of pupils in this class of schools has more than doubled since 
1861. A report made to the minister of public instruction by M. Rivera, director of 
primary instruction, in regard to carrying out the law of July 15, 1877, on obligatory 
primary instruction in lower grades of schools, gives rather discouraging results. In 
1881~82 of 1,992,172 children of school age there were at the beginning of the year 
1,735,185 on the school registers. In March only 1,500,755 remained on the rolls, and 
the number so constantly decreased that at the close of the year only 232,929 pupils 
presented themselves for examination.. Of this number only 166,185 passed satisfac- 
torily. The reasons for this state of things are considered by M. Rivera to be the 
poverty of the people and the poor quality of teachers. As the parents cannot give 
their children proper food and clothing, they hesitate to send them to school when 
by keeping them away there is a chance to pick up a little money in looking out for 
the flocks and in other ways. So many points of this kind have to be taken into 
consideration that the: parent feels that his children are better off outside of the 
school room until the present condition of affairs can be ameliorated. If salles d’asile 
could be opened, where little folks could have proper care, there would be an increase 
of school attendance. 
A circular was issued in October, 1884, to aid in carrying out the law of July 
15, 1877. In it primary school inspectors are required to furnish annually to each 
syndic a list of children of school age. These lists are to be sent to those who 
arrange the course of study. Inspectors are to receive yearly from the proper author- 
ities a list of said children and of the number really enrolled. Examinations from 
grade to grade, and especially from second to third course, are to be made according 
to the strictest regulations. A list of pupils who have passed such examinations 
successfully must be handed in annually, and all pupils who have failed to pass the 
examination of the third course must stay another year in that grade. Pupils grad- 
uating from the third grade are expected to attend an evening school for a year. 
A permanent commission has been established in connection with the ministry of 
agriculture. It is to have a general oversight of industrial museums, schools of arts 
as applied to industries, schools of design for workingmen, in fact of all institutions 
which have to do with industries as taught to the working classes. 
A technical literary school for girls, in Milan, had over 200 pupils in the latter part 
of 1883. The registration fee was only 5 lire ($1). The course of study embraces 
geography, history, Italian, French, English, and German languages, calligraphy, 
drawing, book-keeping, &c. Lessons are also given in morals, law, «esthetics, natural 
sciences, and in all woman’s handiwork. The making,of artificial leaves and flowers 
is also taught. 
A Protestant institution for the supply of trained English speaking nurses was or- 
ganized and put in successful operation in Rome in the early part of 1883. Several 
nurses were taken from the Bellevue Training School in New York. The intention is 
to establish permanent premises for the institution.

Dr. J. Heemskerk. 
The government publishes the following statistics in regard to superior, secondary, 
and primary instruction in the Netherlands in 1082~83: 
Primary instruction.— In 704 communes the clergy has taken advantage of the law | 
regarding religious instruction and given such instruction out of school hours. On 
December 31, 1882, the number of public schools was 2,822; private subsidized, 76; 
non-subsidized, 1,067. An increase of 38 primary schools over 1881 is reported. 
Evening schools were found in 340 communes; advanced schools, in 407. On Jan-— 
uary 1, 1883, there were 563,085 pupils in the day schools, viz: 294,950 boys and 
268,135 girls. This shows an increase of 5,327 boys and 5,826 girls over the pre- 
vious year. There were 73,900 children of school age not in school, or 13.62 per 
cent. About 18,346 boys and 11,584 girls attend simultaneously day and evening 
schools. In the evening schools only were 6,573 students (4,901 boys and 1,672 
girls). The advanced schools (écoles de répétition) had 13,815 pupils, namely, 
10,888 boys and 2,927 girls. The teaching force in primary grades numbered in 1882 _ 
3,457 males and 469 female principals, 5,328 male and 2,385 women teachers, with 
2,991 male and 1,226 women assistants. These figures give an increase over the year 
1881 of 35 male and 8 female principals, 293 male and 246 women instructors,72 male 
and 79 women assistants. At.the beginning of the school year 1883~84 there were 114 
nornials reported, attended by 3,713 pupils, of these 1,138 were girls. Added to these 
are 2 communal normals and several private establishments of a similar character. 
The expenditure for primary instruction in 1882, on the part of the government, the 
provinces, and the communes, was 13,031,831 florins ;! in 1881 it was 10,198,943 florins. 
All the expenditures together amounted to 17,048,602 florins to 14,168,734 in 1881. 
These totals for educational purposes do not include the sums for military instruction, 
prison schools, or infant schools. A statement in regard to the last mentioned institu- 
tions is as follows: Public institutions, 121; male teachers, 5; women, 160; assistants, 
444; pupils: boys, 10,592; girls, 10,286. Private pecablishimon ts, 715; men teachers, 
27; women teachers, 973; assistants, 1,173; pupils: 31,938 boys and 36,232 girls. There 
are besides in Ni eal 79 infant aeteals and 44 pouponniéres eon which there is 
no information. At The Hague and at Gonda committees have in charge the organi- 
zation of vacation colonies. 
Secondary instruction.— On the 31st of December, 1882, there were 3,741 shadente in 
the 35 burgher schools (day and evening) and 5 communal schools; teachers, 362. 
The drawing, industrial, and professional schools numbered 45, with 260 professors 
and 4,586 students. Sixty-one higher burgher schools had 4,649 pupils, 172 of them 
girls. An increase of 4 schools where girls are admitted brings the number of such 
schools up to 25. Number of professors in the higher burgher schools, 708. Secend- 
ary schools for girls numbered 14, with 1,134 pupils at date of December, 1882, to 
1,089 in 188i; teachers, 168, 115 of them women. There were 342 students and hearers 
at the Polytechnic, 12 of them women. Eleven schools of navigation are reported, 3 
deaf-mute schools, and 1 for the blind. The expenditures for secondary instruction 
were 1,763,630 florins.

EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXXxIxX 
The communal university at Amsterdam had 589 students and hearers. There were 
also 25 Gymnasien and 4 Progymnasien ; teachers, 358 (in 1881-82 there were 334); 
students, 2,170 to 1,911 in 1881~82. The expenditures amounted to 1,829,254 florins. 
Norway, constitutional monarchy: Area, 122,869 square miles ; population (at close of 1880), 1,913,000. 
Capital, Christiania; population in 1875, 76,054. Minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs, N. 
C. E. Hertzberg (appointed January 30, 1882). 
Full statistics of education in Norway are wanting. However, in 1880 there were 
6,617 elementary schools, with 279,668 pupils. In 1879 5,014 pupils were reported in 
the higher grades, and in 1882 there were 870 students at the University in Chris- 
tiania. In the budget of 1883 the sum of 136,4287. was set down for elementary edu- 
cation. Most of the towns support a high grade of school, and in 17 of the principal 
towns there is an éffentlig skole or college. These are maintained partly by subsidies 
from the government. Taxes are levied in every parish for the support of schools, 
and there are also state grants. The school age is 7-14 in towns and 8-14 in rural 
districts. Education is compulsory throughout the kingdom. By a law of June, 
1869, middle, or 6-class, schools were established’ in Norway. These form a link be- 
tween common schools and Gymnasien and serve as preparatory to the Gymnasium, 
besides giving a general education to children who do not intend to pursue their 
education further. Pupils desiring to enter must have reached their ninth year 
and have passed the required examination. The instruction begins with religion, 
the mother tongue, history, geography, writing, and arithmetic. German is taken 
up the second semester; natural sciences and drawing, next; a year later, geometry. 
With the fourth year there is a division of studies, and it rests with the pupil to fol- 
low either the English or Latin course. French is studied the fifth year, but it is not 
obligatory. After graduating from these 6-class schools the pupil is ready for either the 
Realschule or Gymnasium. Pupils in the Realschule follow a one or two year course, 
the studies tending towards a business education. The studies are arranged in 
groups, some of the modern tongues entering into one of the groups. The Gymnasien 
are subdivided, as Latin- and Real-Gymnasien, the courses following on in the same 
line as in the middle schools. Latin is not taken up in the Realgymnasium. In the 
Latin division English is an optional study; in the Realgymnasium German is a part of 
the regular course. The Gymnasien have 3-year courses, at the close of which the “ ex- 
amen artium” takes place. Graduates are then ready for either university or techni- 
cal schools. Should a Latin student wish to enter the military school he must pass 
an examination in some of the branches taught in the Realgymnasium. The Norwe- 
gian statesman Johann Sverdrup has projected the following reforms in education, 
which, if carried out, will be of great bevefit to all concerned: He suggests more 
years to be spent in acquiring an education; additional branches ; better text books, 
and instruction in the language suited to locality; gymnastic exercises, military 
drill, and handwork; better normal methods and employment of women teachers who 
are properly trained ; higher salaries; employment of more cultivated and energetic 
men on school boards; new regulations concerning employment of school officers, &c. 
All of this, he says, will tend to the greater enlightenment of the people.

An interesting account of education in Portugal (from the pen of Hon, John M. 
Francis) was given in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1882~83. The 
only item of information on hand since then is the following statement in regard to 
an educational commission: 
Portugal is to have a superior council of public instruction. It is to be divided into 
two sections: the one, comprising 12 members and forming a permanent section, is to 
be named hy the King; the other, comprising 22 members, is to be formed by elec-

tion. The elected members will be taken from representatives of the three grades of 
instruction. Superior instruction is to have 15 members, secondary instruction 3,

The following interesting statements concerning the school system of Russia are 
taken from a lecture by Dr. Theodor Vetter, a native of Switzerland, who resided 
for four years in Russia, where he was a private tutor and later a teacher at the 
Grand Duke Nicholas Lyceum in Moscow: | 
Public education is under a department at the head of which is the minister of 
ublic instruction. He, with his assistant and five or seven specialists, forms the 
ighest legislative and administrative body in the department, whose decisions have 
to be approved only by the Emperor. The Empire is divided into twelve adminis- 
trative districts, though Finland has a separate school system of its own and Cau- 
casus and the countries east of the Aral Sea have their schools under military super- 
vision, The minister of public instruction is represented in each of the school districts 
by a ‘‘curator,” who appoints the teachers in the Gymnasien and scientific schools. 
The school laws are excellent, but the execution of them is quite another thing. 
They are drafted from foreign models, but many of them are entirely inapplicable, 
In 1847 Russia had 2,500 schools, with 2,700 teachers and 125,000 pupils, 55,000 of 
whom were children of foreign colonists. In 1864 Count Tolstoi, late minister of 
public instruction, shifted the burden of the primary schools in each province upon 
thé Zemstvo, which is an assembly of representatives of the administrative district. 
This was a decentralizing movement, but the Zemstvo, without resources, was, and 
still remains, an undeveloped institution. At thé same time, during the past fifteen 
years the number of common schools has increased. In 1871 there were 16,700 schools, 
with 675,000 pupils; but this is only about 1 pupil out of about 100 inhabitants, while 
statisticians usually put the number of children between 6 and 14 years of age at 10 
per cent. of the population; there are provinces, too, where the schools have to be 
closed for want of money. The provinces with factories and other industrial estab- 
lishments show the best school attendance. The full course in the common schools 
consists of five classes of one year each. Religious instruction is given. The teachers 
are poor, and, although between 1866 and 1876 Count Tolstoi greatly increased the 
number of seminaries from which they could be drawn, the supply is yet inadequate. 
Institutions for higher education are in a better condition. The Gymnasien, modelled 
on those of Germany, bring the student about as far as the sophomore class in Amer- 
ican colleges. Boys of the higher classes receive a home education until about the 
twelfth or fifteenth year, at which time they enter the Gymnasium or a military 
school. | Instruction is somewhat faulty in the Gymnasium, but one good point is that 
teachers divide the work of instruction in a foreign language in such a way that the 
students practise their own and the foreign tongue alternately with a person who in 
each case is native to that language. In 1866 there were 108 Gymnasien j in 1876 there 
were 202, of which 183 fitted students for the university. Under Tolstoi’s administra- 
tion all students had to take up Greek and Latin, The universities are the best and 
most prosperous schools in Russia. They are similar to German universities and are 
really professional schools. ‘The passing of the final examination gives the student 
the right to practise the profession he has chosen. 
The Czech journal, Ucitelské Noviny, of Prague, publishes the following statistics 
of primary schools in the 10 academic districts of Russia in Europe, as well as those 
of Siberia and Turkestan. The figures are for 1883 unless otherwise designated. The 
total number of primary schools is 24,853; pupils, nearly 2,000,000; the expenditures, 
nearly 8,000,000 rubles.! Of this amount 41 per cent. is furnished by the communes 
and 34 per cent. by the Zemstvos.

bNinety versts (square) make 100 square kilometres. 
¢ The majority of the schools of the Baltic are not under charge of the ministry of public instruction, 
which accounts for the small number reported. 
In 1883 there were 62 Russian normal schools reported, 42 of them maintained by 
the government, 11 by the Zemstvos, 1 by the Marie Agricultural Society of Moscow, 
and 1 by special funds. The budget amounted to 1,241,991 rubles. There were 4,423 
pupils (3,803 men and 620 women). Of these, 51 per cent. belonged to the peasant 
class, 20 per cent. to ecclesiastical families, and 11 percent. to families of officials or 
to the nobility. The normals are said to furnish a considerable number of teach- 
ers to the schools of the Zemstvos. The principal faults of the teachers are lack of 
general instruction, too theoretical knowledge, and the lack of energy to carry out 
their duties, The remedies proposed are to create a preparatory class, to render 
the examinations more severe, to add a fourth year to the normal course, and te- 
give the third and fourth years to practical exercises. At date of October, 1884, 
on account of disturbances among the students, the university at Kieff was closed 
till January 1, 1885. All the students were dismissed with the prohibition of recep- 
tion into other universities of the Russian Empire, with the right of readmittance, 
however, into Kieff University through the medium of the commission specified in 
article 3 of the imperial rules respecting universities. It is said that this means ex- 
clusion forever from Kieff and every other Rugsian university of those who on Sep- 
tember +, 1884, were enrolled as students of Kieff University. The Russian govern- 
ment has also issued a circular to the principals of schools in Russia, holding them 
responsible for any revolutionary tendencies their pupils may have and enjoining 
them to maintain strict supervision over their pupils in order to dissipate the slight- 
est flavor of nihilistic sentiments. 
A number of new regulations concerning the organization of the Russian univer- 
sities have lately received the imperial sanction. These regulations, which vary 
somewhat from those of 1863, are to take effect in 1884~’85. The principal points of 
interest are enumerated below : 
The universities are under the special protection of His Majesty the Emperor and 
are called imperial universities. Each university has four faculties— history and phi- 
lology, physics and mathematics, law, and medicine —and the University of St. Peters- 
burg has a special faculty for Orientallanguages. Although the universities are-nomi- 
nally under charge of the minister of public instruction, they are really in charge,- 
each one, of the curator for the local district, who reports to the minister. Tho rector, 
who is chosen from among the ordinary professors of the university, has a 4-year 
term of office, which may be lengthened to.4 years more by imperial order. ..The

rector is the real head of the university, and, where he formerly had to defer to 
the university council, as he was chosen by the corps of professors, he now, by virtue 
of being appointed by the minister of public instruction, has a more extended au- 
thority. The inspector of studies is now named by the curator, but receives orders 
from the rector. The examinations are carried on as heretofore by the faculties, but 
others may be appointed by the minister to take part in these ceremonies. The 
professors are now permitted to treat of other subjects than those laid down in the 
regular course ; they are to be paid extra for such lectures, and fees, which formerly 
went to the university budget, may be accepted by the professors. The number of 
professors for the 8 universities is to be increased from 364 to 385. In each, chairs 
of ethnography, geography, and commercial law are created. The system of Privat- 
docenten is also adopted, and the courses of studies are divided into semesters instead 
of years 4s formerly, viz, 10 semesters for medicine and 8 for the other branches. The — 
board of directors of each university is composed of the deans of all the faculties 
and of the inspector, the rector presiding. The dean is chosen by the curator for a 
4-year term from among the professors. His term of office may also be extended 
4 years by order of the minister. At the University of Moscow, a councillor for 
the economic service (conseiller pour le service économique) is added to the board 
of directors. A special chair of theology is created for students of the orthodox 
faith. The professor is a member of the council without being a part of the faculty. 
The faculty of history and philology (12 ordinary and 5 extraordinary professors) 
embraces 11 subjects ; that of physics and mathematics (same number of professors), 
10 topics; that of law, (11 ordinary and 4 extraordinary professors), 12 branches; 
that of medicine (14 ordinary and 9 extraordinary professors), 23 subjects; that of 
Oriental languages at St. Petersburg, which embraces nine languages, has 6 ordi- 
nary and 3 extraordinary professors. The number of professors may be increased on 
demand, and special teachers are to be employed for German, French, English, and 
Italian. The semesters are from August 20 to December 20 and from January 15 to 
May 30. There are two kinds of examinations: those before a commission and before 
the faculties. Students are admitted to the former if they have been ten semesters \ 
in the faculty of medicine or eight in the other faculties. They appear for exam- 
ination before the faculty for admission to university grades, for scholarships or 
some material aid, and at the end of the semester (this last obligatory in the faculty of 
medicine only). No person may be a professor unless he has the degree of doctor in 
ihe specialty which he is to teach, and he must have acted as Privatdocent for at least 
3 years. The professor who has held that position during 25 years becomes a pro- 
fessor emeritus. Students to be admitted to the universities must have graduation 
diplomas from the Gymnasium. Hearers are also to be admitted to the courses, accord- 
ing to regulations to be established by the minister of public instruction. The stu- 
cent and the hearer pay five rubles a semester as matriculation fees, then one ruble 
each semester and weekly course.

No statistics of public education in Spain have been received since the publication 
of the last report. A private educational institution called the Institucion Libre de 
Ensefianza has attracted attention in the last few years, both on account of the ob- 
jects of its founders and its method of conducting instruction. An account of that 
institution is therefore given here, 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
    
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXXXIII 
The Institucion Libre de Ensefianza is a private institution which was founded in 
Madrid in 1876 for the purpose of extending national education. To this end it has 
established (1) a school in which instruction is given in primary and secondary 
branches; (2) a course of public lectures and concerts; (3) special courses intended 
to diffuse popular information of the principal events of history and to give an idea 
of the greatest works in literature and art; (4) instruction in making researches and 
investigations under the supervision of professors supplied by the institution; and 
(5) the publication of a periodical and of various other works, among which may be 
mentioned a set of photomicrographs, the first published in Spain. 
Many of the most eminent men in science, literature, art, and politics in Spain con- 
tribute to these publications, and by their aid the institution has been enabled to sup- 
ply in part the deficiencies of university education. The program it announces em- 
braces the history of the Slavic nations, the Code Napoléon, legislation concerning 
mortgages, the institutions of the United States, positive philosophy, elementary 
mathematics, geometry, chemistry, natural history, the history of modern literatures 
and languages, Latin, philology, architecture, &c. 
The students of the institution were the first in Spain to introduce students’ excur- 
sions; they have begun to form herbariums, mineralogical and entomological collec- 
tions, &c:, and they make topographical reliefmaps. The notes and observations col- 
lected by the professors and students during their excursions serve as material for 
small guide books to the more important places in the country, such as Salamanca, To- 
ledo, Seville, and Granada. This method of study and the introduction of astronomy, 
sociology, the history of fine arts, law, singing, drawing, gymnastics, and French 
into the course of study form so many innovations in instruction in Spain. After 
the study of French was introduced into the program of the institution, the govern- 
ment made the study of that language obligatory in the official institutions. The 
same will be done, before long, with gymnastics. The excursions now form as im- 
portant a feature in Spain as in any other country in Europe. They are of all kinds, 
from those of an hour or two in length to others which last a month, and the range 
of subjects studied covers archeology, botany, geology, mineralogy, and agriculture 
and other industries. The students of tho institution are in charge of the professors 
alone at all times, no system of surveillance intervening between the teachers and 
their pupils. In the staff of professors there is no rank, but all are on an equality, 
and those teachers who are selected to give primary instruction are chosen because 
of a special aptitude for that branch and not because they are less learned than their 
colleagues. The institution gives the title of honorary professor to distinguished 
men who have rendered eminent services to science or education, such as Darwin, 
Tyndall, Berthelot, Andrade-Corvo, Tiberghien, &c. The instruction given is free ~ 
from all political, religious, or philosophical bias, each professor being responsible 
for his own doctrines. 
The institution was established on shares of 250 francs each and by private gifts, 
without any aid from the state. It is managed by a body of directors, half of whom 
are replaced every year. The directors are elected by members of the society and by 
the professors, who have exclusive control of the scientific and pedagogic manage- 
ment of the institution, elect the rector, vice rector, and the editor of the Journal 
annually, and arrange the excursions, 
The object of the institution is to modify primary instruction so as to make it con- 
form to the principles of modern pedagogics. This means the substitution of class 
study for home study, of the intuitive method for the time honored memorizing; the 
jntroduction of regulated physical exercise, &c. The same method and principles 
are employed in secondary as in primary instruction, since secondary education is 
only a continuation of elementary. It is hoped that before long some branches of 
superior instruction may be added to the present course, so that the scope of the insti- 
tution will soon become more comprehensive, The character of the institution is ex-

plained in an extract from its constitution, published at the head of each number o: 
its periodical (Boletin de la Institucion Libre de Ensefianza), which is as follows: 
The Institucion Libre Ge Ensefianza is entirely aloof from the spirit or interests of 
any special religious communion, any school of philosophy, and of any political party. 
It proclaims only the principle that knowledge should be free and inviolable, and 
consequently that there should be complete independence in searching for and im- 
parting it, without having regard to any other authority than the conscience of the 
professors ‘themsely es, who alone should be responsible for their doctrines.

General statistics of Swedish schools were presented in the Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1881 and Swedish high schools are fully treated in the report 
for 1882-83. From an official report of the Stockholm public schools (Ofverstyrelsens 
fér Stockholms Stads Folkskolor underdaniga Beriittelse fér 4r 1883) the following 
information is taken, In the year 1862 the number of pupils attending the common 
schools of Stockholm was 2,456. This number gradually increased uutil in 1873 there 
were 7,821 children at school; in 1883 they numbered 11,353, In addition to thes», at 
the last date mentioned, there were 1,826 children not in daily attendance, yet still 
benefiting by school instruction —in all, 13,179, an increase of 1,214 over 1882. There 
were 300 school rooms reported, a total of 353 teachers, and 341 classes. Besides the ed- 
ucational instruction given in these folkskolar there were of course other educational 
institutions scattered throughout the city. These included evening and Sunday schools 
connected in a measure with the public schools. Counting the pupils in attend- 
ance—some for all day instruction, others attending the half day schools—the total 
number of children who were having schooling in 1883 was 22,614. The course of 
study in the conmon schools covered religion, the mother tongue, arithmetic, writing, 
geography, history, natural sciences, geometry, drawing, singing, gymnastics, mili- 
tary exercises, and handwork. The total income for school purposes was 669,751 
crowns; the expenditure for education for the year mounted up to the same in the 
city of Stockholm. 
The Redogérelse for Kongl. Universitet i Upsala under Lisiren, 1877-1883, gives 
interesting information in regard to university instruction during those years. The 
year 1877 was the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of this university, 
and was consequently held asa festival. Still another festal occasion was in honor 
of Carl von Linné and Johan Ludvig Runeberg in the spring of 1878. The report 
covers many of the incidents connected with these celebrations, gives an account 
of the organization of the university, and enters quite fully into the work of the 
members of the faculties. The university has a fine library, an anatomical and a 
physiological collection, medical clinics, a pharmaceutical department, laboratories for 
general and analytical chemistry, zodlogical and botanical museums, a department 
of physics and an astronomical observatory, and a fine meteorological collection. In 
the philological section there are divisions for the Northern and the Romance tongues. 
In the department of mathematics, the subjects covered are equations, algebraic 
theorems, differential and integral calculus. Both military drill and gymnastics are 
taken up. In 1877 there were 1,517 students distributed among the faculties of the- 
ology, law, medicine, and philosophy; in 1883 there were 1,588 students in the fol- 
lowing courses: theology, 162; law, 261; medicine, 211; philosophy, 954, 
SWITZERLAND, federal republic: Area, 15,892 square miles; population, 2,846,102. Capital, Berne;

The latest statistics for all the Swiss cantons were given in the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for 188283. The following additional information is gath- 
ered from various sources. 
Aargau reports 472 male and 81 female teachers in the district schools in 1883. The

minimum salary was 600franes ; average for the whole canton, 1,139 francs. A change 
for the better is, however, in progress, as the commission for the revision of school 
affairs decided that the minimum salary for common school teachers should be 1,200 
franes. The school property of the various districts reached a valuation of 6,083,918 
francs; district expenditures, 1,067,239 frances ; expenditures of the state, which in- 
clude amounts for cantonal libraries and scientific collections, 440,429 francs. Aargau 
has 26 4-class district schools, with 76 principal and 107 assistant teachers. The 
cantonal school (Kantonsschule) numbers 134 pupils; the teachers’ seminary (for males) 
in Wettingen, 35 pupils; and the teachers’ seminary (for women) in Aarau, 42 pupils. 
There are 24 regular “advanced” schools (Fortbildungsschulen) and 59 private 
(freiwillige) ones. Four educational institutions (asylums or charity schools) are re- 
ported; 3 deaf-mute institutions, at Aarau, Baden, and Zofingen; and a reformatory 
at Lenzburg. The question of reducing the course in seminaries from four to three 
years is still undecided. 
Berne (canton) reports for 188384 a number of new primary school-houses, better 
attendance at this grade of school than heretofore, and a general decrease in the 
number of absentees in the primary grades. There were 7,941 poor children aided 
by gifts of clothing and nourishment. A total of 117 private institutions is reported, 
49 of them for young children, with 5,167 pupils and 247 instructors. There were 1,918 
teachers in the primary grades and 97,778 pupils in 1883-’84, The Miidchenarbeits- 
schulen nunibered 1,789 in March, 1883, with 49,016 pupils and 1,492 women teach- 
ers. The middle schools (Mittelschulen) had 4,986 pupils and 371 teachers. The 
teachers’ seminaries at Miinchenbuchsee, Pruntrut, Hindelbank, and Delsberg had 10 
classes, 215 students, and 24 instructors (male and female). At the high school (uni- 
versity) and veterinary school there were 565 in attendance at the winter semester of 
1883~84, and 36 of these were women. The women studied medicine or philosophy. 
The faculty numbered 94, 11 of whom were in the veterinary school. The deaf and 
dumb institution at Frienisberg had 61 pupils at the commencement of the year. 
Freiburg reports that on October 1, 1884, a new primary school law went into effect. 
This law requires better salaries for teachers, the aid to come from the state in poorer 
districts; stricter school attendance; and an obligatory attendance on the advanced 
school (Fortbildungsschule). 
Lucerne (city) had 2,925 boys and girls in school in 1883-84, an increase of 71 over 
the previous year. A free hand drawing school, in which gratuitous instruction was 
given, led up to the industrial art school proper. 
The cantonal school and the school of theology in Lucerne report as follows: 30 
teachers for Gymnasium, Realschule, lyceum, and school of theology ; 90 pupils in the 
5-class Realschule; 101 in 6 classes of the Gymnasium; 34 pupils in the two courses 
of the lyceums; and 12 students in the 3 courses in theology; total in the institu- 
tion, 237. There were 93 pupils in the school of music, 65 in the industrial art school, 
and 45 in the advanced school for industrial drawing. Thirteen pupils passed the 
examination for higher studies. Other schools of the canton report as follows: 
The teachers’ seminary in Hitzkirch had 6 teachers and 27 pupils. The middle school 
in Willisau had 4 Realklassen, with 6 teachers and 46 pupils. The Progymnasium 
and Realschule of Sursee had 4 Realklassen and 4 gymnasial classes. Eight instruct- 
ors and 44 students are connected with this school. The middle school of Miinster has 
changed its form since the preceding year. According to governmental regulation of 
September 14, 1883, the third and fourth classes of the Realdivision were suspen- 
ded. As at present organized there are 2 ‘‘secondary” classes and 4 progymnasial 
classes. The 6 teachers have charge of 31 pupils. 
Thurgau is to introduce the new orthography in the schools early in 1885 and 
have the text books printed in the same. The Kantonsschule, which has industrial, 
gymnasial, musical, and military divisions, reported 180 pupils at the beginning of 
the course and 168 at close of the year 1883~’84. 
A Swiss National Exhibition was held in 1883 at’Ziirich. In connection with the

CCXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Kindergarten display it is stated that most of these schoo!s are created by special 
societies and it is only within a short time that the communes have taken charge. 
Geneva is the only canton in which the Kinderyiirten are cantonal institutions. In 
the canton of St. Gall there aro 5 Kindergiirten, 3 of them in the town and suburbs of 
St. Gall. The teachers generally receive about 600 francs in rural communities, from 
800 to 1,000 francs in the towns and suburbs, and some of the principals get 1,000 
francs. In some of the cantons, and at Ziirich in particular, primary or elementary 
instruction is divided into two distinct parts: the first part or all day school has 6 
years of study, or 6 classes; the second part (Ergiinzungsschule) has 3 years of study. 
The lower classes are called elementary, the upper classes the Realschule. This differs 
from the German Realschule, which is for secondary instruction. The Ergiinz- 
ungsschule is only obligatory two half days each week for boys and three for girls, 
and that only to the age of 14 or 15 years. The Fortbildungsschulen are professional 
schools, with from 2 to 20 lessons a week. At the Gewerbeschule in Ziirich there are, 
however, 118 lessons in the course, the courses lasting from 3 to 12 months. A school 
of drawing and modelling at Basle is highly spoken of. It was founded in 1796. 
There were 673 pupils in the first semester of 1883 and 515 at the second semester. 
In the canton of Ziirich the technical school of Winterthur comprises the following 
divisions: School of industrial arts and architecture, a school of mechanics, school 
of chemistry, school of drawing and modelling for artistic industries, and a school 
for geometricians. The municipal art schools of Geneva are among the most com- 
plete in Switzerland. They have 3 divisions: lower, middle, and higher. Among 
these schools is the school of industrial arts, which had 218 pupils in 1882-83, sub- 
divided as follows: Modelling figures and ornaments, 64; sculpture in wood and 
stone, 32; carving, 27; ceramics, aquarelle, and composition, 95. Needlework is taught 
in the primary schools 4 hours a week to children between 6 and 9 years of age, and 
6 hours a week to those of 9 to 12 years. In the Ergiinzungsschule it is obligatory 
(4 hours a week) for pupils of 12 to 14 years and optional (6 hours) for those of 14 to 
16 years. 
An interesting communication received by the Commissioner of Education in Decem- 
ber, 1884, from Dr. Franz Miicke, of Berne, gives a detailed account of the Swiss 
Permanent School Exhibition, established by the Canton of Berne at Berne, and- 
aided by the Central Swiss Government. Explanations of different subjects treated 
at that exhibition are quite fully given. After referring to the general opposition 
growing against the Kindergarten in Germany and Switzerland, Dr. Miicke turns to 
the subject of myopia: 
Another point of general importance is the prevention of myopia. Professor 
Fahrner, of Ziirich, and Dr. Gu&laume, of Neufchatel, have advanced a theory of their 
own about nearsightedness; they say that it requires too much straining of the eye to 
discern between the dark color of the slate, the slate book, or the “ silicon” and the 
gray stroke of the slate or lead pencil. They therefore insist upon tho necessity of 
writing on paper with ink. This being too expensive for poor people and the gov- 
ernmen’ never allowing writing and drawing utensils to be dispensed free of charge 
to the pupils, these gentlemen overcame the difficulty by interesting a few wealthy 
manufacturers in this matter, who now furnish all the writing materials for 1 franc 
a year to a child of the first primary class, for 2 francs to a child of the second or third 
class, and for 4 francs all the writing and drawing materials to each pupil of the higher 
classes, including ruler, compasses, gauge, &c. 
The supply of these materials is exhibited, and it is astonishing indeed to see how 
such an amount of things can be given without loss for such a trifle. The same 
remark may be properly applied to the whole exposition, where one may learn how 
much may be accomplished by economy, integrity, and study. 
Myopia and scoliosis are the most frequent diseases of school children and are con- 
sidered to originate from thesame cause by Dr. Pfluger, professor of ophthalmology in 
Berne. He avers that an improper inclination of the school desks, table, &c., causes 
both myopia and scoliosis. According to his theory of vision, with school children 
a table ought to be inclined exactly at an angle of 30° while the child is sitting in 
an erect position. To accomplish this he and Dr. Liithi had a desk constructed which 
answers the purposs of tending to prevent myopia and scoliosis, and which is used 
with great benefit and universal satisfaction in the Gymnasium of Berne.

The back of the seat is well adapted to the flexure of the spine, its curvature having 
been determined after many experiments performed on children sitting in a straight 
position. The long mooted question puzzling sanitarists and philanthropists as to 
the possibility of giving each child a separate desk, seems to be solved by this inven- 
tion or moditication. ‘The price of this school furniture does not exceed $2.50. 
In a diagram which classifies the 70 districts of Switzerland according to the 
average standing of the recruits who passed the official examination from 1875 up to 
1821, the city of Basle takes the lead, Geneva and Ziirich following asthe second and 
third states respectively, and Berne asthe nineteenth state. Such a result was rather 
alarming to the authorities of Berne, since compulsory education lasts 9 years, from 
the sixth to the fifteenth year, while in Basle 7 and in Ziirich 6 years suffice to elevate 
the pupils to a much higher standard. To be brief, the highest rate is not obtained 
by the long term of 9 years’ training, but by a strict enforcement of the compulsory 
laws, by a regular instruction, not broken by extended vacations, and by a better pay- 
ment of school teachers, who are both able and willing to raise the standard of knowl- 
edge among their pupils to a higher degree within 6 years than others do within 9. 
It is fair to add that the Canton of Berne, by observing those rules, worked itself up 
to the fourth place. 
I cannot finish this letter without mentioning the Association for Handiwork Schools 
in Basle, founded in accordance with the principles and ideas of the Danish philan- 
thropist, Clausen-Kaas. A branch of this society was recently formed in Berne, and 
will commence its work in January, 1885. It is the aim of this society to cope with 
the general aversion of children to manual labor, to imbue their minds with persever- 
ance, to keep them from laziness, to diffuse knowledge of ordinary work among the 
higher classes, and to bridge the gulf existing between them and the common people.

The Grecian and Armenian schools of Constantinople were reported as follows at a 
late date. The Greeks number 300,000 persons, and they have 88 educational institu- 
tions, in which the teaching force consists of 316 persons and the pupils number 
13,992 boys and 4,951 girls. The amount of money expended annually for these 
schools is 716,770 francs, so that each school gets an average of 8,148 francs; each 
pupil costs 52 francs annually. 
The Armenians are 200,000 strong, with 52 schools, 219 teachers, and 5,225 boys and 
2,119 girls under instruction. The amount of money expended is 368,000 francs. 
These figures give one school to 3,409 Greeks and one to 3,844 Armenians. 
A private individual has given large amounts to the Greck schools. The German 
burgher school is reported to be in a fine condition, and the need of higher classes in 
connection with this school is freely expressed. The Italian Government has also 
undertaken to establish a school for the Italians resident in Constantinople, and 
20,000 francs have already been given for that purpose. The Russian Government is 
also about to take a similar course in regard to the education of Russian youth. 
According to the report of the Central Turkey College for 1883~84 there were 102 
pupils received into the college during the year. The number in actual attendance 
on June 10, 1884, was 99. Of the whole number of students 38 were in the prepara- 
tory department, 46 in the college proper, and 18 in the medical department. Av- 
erage age of those in the preparatory, a fraction over 174 years; in the college, a little 
over 20 years. Thirty of the students are members of evangelical churches; 22 of 
them are from the Gregorian Armenians. The general progress and discipline of the 
students are reported to have been better than in any previous year. The number of 
full professors connected with the college during the year was 7; first class as- 
sistant teachers, 3. Four were Americans and 6 Protestant Armenians. Of these, 4 
were in the scientific department and 3 in the medical. Good progress is reported 
in the medical school. In September, 1883, a trained nurse from Scotland was added 
to the staff of assistants. Her labors were most successful. The financial condition 
of the college had improved since 188283. 
Four young Turkish ladies have just passed very successful examinations as school 
and handiwork teachers at Constantinople, and are to have positions in schools of 
that city. This is the first time that Turkish women haye come up for these examina- 
tions.

  CCXXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
RovumELia (Eastern): Area, 18,500 square miles; population, 1884 (estimated), 850,000. 
The board of directors of public instruction in Eastern Roumelia presented the fol- 
lowing report for 1882~’83 to the governor general: 
The primary schools of the country form 50 school districts, each of which has an 
inspector. In this total are 27 Bulgarian districts, 3 Grecian, 16 Turkish, 1 Bulgarian 
Catholic and 1 Bulgarian Protestant, 1 Armenian, and 1 Jewish district. The num- 
ber of schools is 616, with 39,131 pupils (29,884 boys and 9,247 girls); teachers (male), 
786; female, 150. During the year the first normal school was established, at Kezan- 
lik, with 56 pupils, 30 scholarships. Twelve pedagogical courses, of 6 weeks each, 
were attended by 519 male and 52 female instructors. Nine holders of scholarships 
were sent to other lands to study pedagogy, viz, 4 at Prague, 2 at Agram, 1 at Vienna, 
1 at Moscow, and 1 in America. The six departmental school councils held eight ses- 
sions during the year. At the annual session of the provincial school council regula- 
tions for evening and Sunday schools were approved of. A plan of studies for use of 
the normal school was also drawn off. 
The board of directors has undertaken to publish a pedagogical journal, and also to 
bring out a digest of school legislation from 1879 to 1883, 
TL—Asta. 
Britisa Inp1a: Area, 1,883,504 square miles ; population, 253,906,449. 
On the 3d of February, 1882, the Government of India appointed an education com- 
mission, with a view to inquiring into the working of the existing system of public 
instruction and to the further extension of that system on a popular basis. The 
system has been developed in accordance with the policy outlined in the dispatches 
of 1854 and 1859, the former being the date at which the education of the whole people 
of India was definitely accepted as a state duty. 
As set forth in the dispatch of 1854, the state undertook (1) to give pecuniary as- 
sistance on the grant in aid system to efficient schools and colleges; (2) to direct their 
efforts and afford them counsel and advice; (3) to encourage and reward the desire 
for learning in various ways, but chiefly by the establishment of universities; (4) to 
take measures for providing a due supply of teachers and for making the profession 
of teaching honorable and respected. 
The second great dispatch on education, that of 1859, reiterated and confirmed the 
provisions of the earlier dispatch, with the single exception of the course to be adopted 
for promoting elementary education. It was noted that the native community failed 
to codperate with the government in promoting vernacular education, and strong 
doubts were expressed as to the suitability of the grant in aid system, as hitherto in 
force, for the supply of vernacular education to the masses of the population. Such 
vernacular instruction should, it was suggested, be provided by the direct instru- 
mentality of the officers of government, on the basis of some one of the plans already 
in operation for the improvement of indigenous schools or by any modification of 
those plans which might suit the circumstances of different provinces. 
The expediency of imposing a special rate on the land for the provision of ele- 
mentary education was also commended to the careful consideration of the govern- 
ment. In short, these instructions confirmed the principle of incorporating and im- 
proving the existing indigenous schools, rather than of inducing the people to set up 
new schools under the grant in aid systems then in force; but they also sanctioned 
the establishment of new schools by direct departmental agency. Accordingly, the 
local governments considered themselves free to adopt whichever system seemed to 
be best suited to local circumstances. 
In the instructions to the commission created in 1882 attention is called to the fact 
that, although the development of elementary education was one of the main objects 
contemplated by the dispatch of 1854, owing to a variety of circumstances, more prog-
-P-A-G-E-239

  ress up to the present time has been made in high and middle than in primary edu- 
cation. While there is no disposition on the part of the government to check or 
hinder such progress, it is submitted that the means by which elementary education 
may be extended and improved should be their principal care. 
In the investigation which lasted from the ‘10th of February, 1882, to the 16th of 
March, 1883, the commission embraced every grade of instruction and all classes of 
schools as well as the particulars of administration, finance, and legislation. 
In the endeavor to collate the mass of information obtained, the commission divided 
the questions before it into six principal branches, as follows: (1) Indigenous and 
primary education; (2) secondary and collegiate education; (3) the internal admin- 
istration of the education department, including the system of inspection and exam- 
inations; (4) the external relations of the education department, including grants in 
aid and the withdrawal of government in favor of native management of' colleges 
and schools; (5) the education of special classes of the community requiring excep- 
tional treatment; (6) educational legislation. 
A series of propositions was drawn up on each of these subjects by the committee 
intrusted with its consideration. These propositions were then discussed and adopted, 
rejected, or modified by the commission, The conclusions arrived at were embodied 
in 222 specific recommendations which are to be accepted as the deliberate decisions 
of the commission. : 
It would be manifestly impossible to embody in this place a detailed abstract of 
the report, in which the commission sets forth the information brought to light by 
its labors and the conclusions formed. I shall only attempt to give a brief summary 
of the present condition of education in India as shown in the report of the commis- 
sion, with certain of the conclusions and recommendations with reference to element- 
ary schools and female education. 
The report deals with nine provinces of India, viz, Madras, Bombay, Bengal, the 
Northwestern Provinces and Oude, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, Assam, Coorg, 
and Haidarabad assigned districts, commonly called Berar. Regret is expressed that 
the commission was not able to visit the outlying province of Ajmir-Mhairwara, but 
the report contains information of the status of education in this province derived 
from the administration report of the same for 1881~82. 
British Burmah is not included in the report, nor are those native states of India 
which, unlike the feudal states of Bombay, either administer their own systems of 
public instruction or else leave education entirely to private effort, without any 
assistance from the state. 
The area of the nine provinces specified, together with Ajmir, according to the edu- 
cational census of 1381, is 897,608 square miles; the total male population is 104,432,229 
and the total female population 100,661,146. Speaking generally, it is stated that the 
governments of Bombay, the Northwestern Provinces, the Punjab, Central Provinces, 
Coorg, and the Haidarabad assigned districts have worked mainly on the departmental 
system, i. e., the establishment of new schools by direct departmental agency. The 
total population of these provinces amounts to more than 99,000,000, or not far short 
of one-half the-whole population whose educational systems are under consideration 
of the commission, . 
The provinces in which primary. education has been largely, if not exclusively, built 
upon the indigenous or aided schools are Madras, Bengal, and Assam, with a popula- 
tion numbering 105,500,000. In the report of the commission the phrase “public 
schools” includes departmental aided, as well as unaided but inspected, schools, while 
the phrase “‘ departmental” is applied to schools supported by local fund committees 
and municipalities, as well as those which are exclusively managed by the officers of 
the department. 
Primary schools.—The primary schools, comprising schools maintained by govern- 
ment, local, and municipal funds, aided schools, unaided but inspected schools, and

  primary classes in high and middle schools, and in colleges in 188182 numbered, for 
the nine provinces, 82,916, attended by 2,061,541 pupils (as against 16,473 schools, 
attended by 607,320 pupils, in1870~71). Thus it appears that 1.02 per cent. of the 
entire population in the nine provinces were under instruction, or if the schoolgoing 
population of both sexes be estimated at 15 per cent. of the whole population, then 
6.78 per cent. of them were in primary schools. But these figures do not take into 
account the primary classes of higher schools in Bengal and Assam, which were giv- 
ing instruction to about 100,000 pupils, nor yet the attendance in the indigenous 
elementary schools outside the state system.! Assuming (says the report) that alto- 
gether there were some 2,520,000 pupils under instruction in 1881~82, this estimate, 
which is the most liberal that we are justified in making, would give only 8.29 per 
cent. of the population of schoolgoing age in the primary schools or classes of India 
in that year. If, again, the male population be separated from the female, then there 
were under primary instruction 15.48 per cent. of the male schoolgoing population, 
and .81 of 1 per cent. of the female schoolgoing population ; while 12.55 of the male 
children and .80 of 1 per cent. of the female were in the primary schools recognized 
by the state. 
As regards race or creed, the pupils in the primary schools aided or inspected by 
the department were distributed as follows:

The number of pupils presented for examination from primary schools in 188182 
was 447,479, viz, 428,171 boys and 19,328 girls. Of these, the number who met the 
requirements was 262,431, viz, 251,010 boys and 11,421 girls. 
The standards represented in these examinations vary considerably. The lowest re- 
quired that candidates should be able to read at sight with facility a moderately easy 
book in a vernacularlanguage, to write to dictation from the same, and to apply the 
first four rules of arithmetic in simple and compound numbers. 
The highest standard required reading the seventh departmental book (inclusive of 
the lessons on the history of ancient and modern Europe and on natural history and 
elementary physics); syntax, prosody, and etymology ; explanation and recitation of 
600 lines of classical vernacular poetry ; composition ; complete arithmetic, with 
native accounts and book-keeping ; geography ; history of India, and sanitary primer. 
There are also, as optional subjects, drawing and field instruction in agriculture. 
Training of teachers.—The training of teachers has always been recognized by the. 
department as an important branch of the work. According to statistics of 188182, 
the total number of teachers (excluding pupil teachers) employed in the depart- 
mental and aided schools of India was 66,552. Of these, 12,243, or 18.39 percent., were 
certificated. In this connection the term certificated has a somewhat wide mean- 
ing. In Bombay and the Central Provinces the certificate is only awarded to those 
  
1¥rom information received up to the time of the preparation of the report, a table was presented 
setting forth the number of scholars in elementary schools outside the influence of the department as 
253,844, The statistics supplied from the Punjab, being defective, were not included. A return sub- 
sequently received and passed by the commission shows 13,109 indigenous schools, with 135,884 pupils 
in the Punjab.

who have gone through a 2-year or a 3-year course in a high class training col- 
lege. In some of the other provinces the term implies that the teacher has gained a 
pupil teacher’s certificate in a primary school. 
The number of training colleges in the several provinces for the same year was 106, 
viz: for men, 91; for women, 15; the total number of students on the rolls on March 
31, 1882, was 3,886: men, 3,371; women, 515; the number of students who left with 
training certificates of various grades was: men, 1,551; women, 42; the expenditure 
on the schools was: for men, 328,636 rupees, and for women, 71,601 rupees, or a total of 
400,237 rupees. (A rupee is 39 cents.) 
Expenditure on primary education.—From a table setting forth in detail the expendi- 
ture on primary education in the years 1870~71 and 1881~82 it appears that in the 
former year the total cost was 3,527,420 rupees and in the latter 7,909,940 rupees. 
With reference to this subject the commissioners observe: 
The first subject which demands notice in Table 7 is the contrast between the 
funds available for extending primary education in 187071 and in 1881~82. In the 
first year, Bombay, the Northwestern Provinces, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, 
and the Haidarabad assigned districts were the only provinces of India in which local 
and inunicipal funds bore any part of the burden of educating the masses. We have 
seen the importance which the secretary of state and the government of India’ at- 
tached to the levy of local fates for primary education. The advantages of asso- 
ciating the development of this branch of public instruction with local taxation 
were both financial and administrative. One argument was supplied by the inability 
of the imperial exchequer to find sufficient funds for so great and increasing a task; 
the other was suggested by the political advantage of intrusting to local boards, 
adininistering local resources, a branch of administration in which local interest 
and supervision could alone secure full efficiency and economy. Accordingly we 
find that in 1881~82 there was no province of India, except Bengal, which had not 
cordially accepted the policy recommended py superior authority. ‘The total ex- 
penditure from provincial, rural, and municipal funds in 1881-82 on primary educa- 
tion was 4,263,070 rupees, of which 60 per cent. was raised locally by urban or rural 
boards, while 40 per cent. fell upon provincial revenues. In 1870-71 49 per cent. of 
the expenditure had been paid by local rates, while 51 per cent. was furnished from 
provincial revenues. But the difference between 59 per cent..and 49 per cent. 
is not the only measure of the success that has attended the imposition of local 
rates. In 188182 the provincial expenditure had increased over that of 1870~71 
hy 33 per cent., while the local and municipal grants to primary education had 
increased by 105 per cent. The local fund revenue has, therefore, been vastly 
more elastic than the provincial grant, and this elasticity is likely to continue in 
future years. This comparison fails, however, to exhibit the results in the most 
striking light. In Bengal there are no local educational rates, and the local rates 
levied in Assam were imposed after the separation of the province from Bengal and 
long after 1871. Excluding, therefore, Bengal and Assam from the present review, 
it appears that in the remaining seven provinces 56 per cent. of the public expendi- 
ture on primary education in 1870~71 was provided by local rates and 44 per cent: 
by imperial, or, as they are now termed, provincialrevenues. In 1881-82 the local rates 
contributed 69 per cent. and the provincial funds 31 per cent. of the public expend- 
iture. In thesame period the provincial grant had increased by only 12 per cent. and 
the local rates by 99 per cent. Thus it is evident that the extension of primary edu- 
cation since 1870~71 in seven of the provinces has almost entirely depended on local 
resources; and it must be remarked that if its history were traced throughout each 
year between 1871 and 1882 it would be found that, whereas the provincial grant has 
varied with financial disturbances caused by war and famine, the local fund incom 
has remained comparatively secure. $ 
Under the head of “ primary education” many special topics are discussed, as moral 
training, physical training, &c. With reference to the place of English in primary 
schools the commissioners observe: 
Considerable conflict of opinion prevails as to the proper place which the study 
of English should occupy in primary schools or classes. Variations of practice de- 
pend to a large extent upon differences of system. In provinces where the pupils 
destined for higher education are separated at the earliest age from the great bulk 
of primary pupils and commence their education in a middle or high school, the 
general tendency is to begin English as soon as possible, and in some cases English is 
taught before the child can read or write his own vernacular. Thus, in the Bengal 
High School English is generally employed as the medium of instruction and is taught 
E—XVI

CCXLIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
_ from the lowest class, but in middle schools its study is discouraged until the boy has 
passed the third standard. In the ordinary village school of Bengal English is very 
rarely taught. In Madras not only is English taught as a language from the lowest 
class of a middle school, but it is also studied in the primary schools from the third 
class upwards; in other words, before the pupil has entered on the upper primary 
standard. The demand for English instruction in the south of India is so strong that 
the large attendance in primary schools is said to be due in no small measure to the 
popular demand for English. In Bombay, on the other hand, the department has 
systematically resisted every attempt to introduce the study of English until a boy 
has completed standard IV and reached the point where secondary education com- 
mences. Even then an English class is not attached to a purely primary school un- 
less those who require it are prepared to pay for the extra cost, As the strictly pri- 
mary course, according to the definition of the government of India, is then completed, 
boys whostudy English ina class attached to a primary school are classified as under 
secondary instruction. There are no primary classes attached to middle schools in 
Bombay, and therefore it follows that in Bombay no pupils under primary instruction 
are returned as studying English. The Bombay department not only believes that 
many good vernacalar schools are liable to be spoiled by the introduction of English 
into the priwary course, but it also argues that the preservation of the vernacular in 
the course of all classes of schools is required, in order that the mental progress of the 
scholar may be reflected in his increased power to make use of his own language. 
It is urged in the report of the provincial committee for Bombay that the despatch 
of 1854 contemplated that the vernaculars would be enriched by translations of Euro- 
pean books or by the compositions of men imbued with the spirit of Evropean ad- 
vancement, and that the only method of thus bringing European knowledge within 
the reach of the masses is to give to every pupil a thorough grounding in the ver- 
nacular aud to keep his attention upon it even up to the college course. In pursu- 
ance of this policy English is rigidly excluded from the primary school course. With 
such a variety of practice we found it impossible to lay down any rule upon the sub- 
ject of English instruction which would suit the circumstances of every province. 
The extent to which English is at present taught to children under primary instruc-    
_ tion in each of the large provinces of India will be seen in the table given below. 
  But it must be noted that! owing to the peculiarities of the Bengal system already de- 
scribed, we are unable to show the number of pupils in the primary classes of secondary 
schools who are learning English. The figures given for Bengal are those of pupils 
in strictly primary schools. For the other provinces the figures in column 3 give the 
number of pupils both in primary schools and in the primary classes of secondary 
schools who are learning English. All that can be said regarding Bengal is that out 
of nearly 140,000 pupils in secondary schools more than 94,000 are in primary classes, 
and would in any other province of India, except Assam, be returned as primary pu- 
pils. Of them al in the primary classes in high schools are learning English, as well 
as some proportion of those in middle schools.

    EDUCATION IN -FOREIGN “COUNTRIES.  CCXLUT 
Female education.—On the 31st of March, 1882, the schools for girls in the nine 
provinces numbered 2,697 and were attended by 127,066 pupils, or .85 of 1 percent. of 
the female population of school age. 
During the year 1831-82 the number of girls presented for prescribed examinations 
was as follows: In collegiate institutions, 5; in secondary institutions, 678; in pri- 
mary institutions, 18,991 ; in normal institutions, 128; total, 19,802. Of these, 11,652, 
or 58.84 per cent., passed ; 40 of these secured teachers’ certificates. 
The contributions from local and municipal funds for female education in all India 
in 1881-82 were 107,889 rupees, the total expenditure being 847,971 rupees. With 
reference to the work accomplished in this respect by other than public agencies, the 
commissioners observe : 
The commission has not before it returns showing the increase of girls’ schools 
under native management, but there is every reason to believe that the number has 
largely augmented of late years. The missionaries are also extending their opera- 
tions, and endowments are from time to time made by wealthy natives for the pro- 
motion of female education, The total expenditure from these and other sources, 
unconnected with the provincial revenues or with local or municipal funds, amounted 
in 1881~82 to 442,665 rupees. This sum is more than one-half of the total expenditure 
on female education, excluding, of course, schools for Europeans and Eurasians, which 
do not come within the purview of the commission. Seat 
Native associations and mixed committees of natives and Europeans interested 
in the cause of female education are pred naty, springing up. for example the 
Arya Mabila Samaj of Poona, composed chiefly of Maratha ladies of position, may 
be expected to exercise an important influence in the capitalof the Deccan. Associa- 
tions of natives and Europeans for the promotion of female education on a secular 
basis form one of the hopeful signs of the times. ‘ 
From all information obtained the commissioners are forced to the conclusion that 
female education is still in an extremely backward condition and that it needs to 
be fostered in every legitimate way. 
Their opinions as to the kind of effort that will prove effectual are very clearly set 
forth in their recommendations upon the subject, which are given hereafter. 
Secondary schools.—In 1882 the secondary schools (middle and high) numbered 3,916, 
attended by 214,077 pupils, as follows: 1,363 government schools, with 62,525 pupils; 
1,863 aided schools, with 111,018 pupils; and 690 unaided schools, with 40,534 pupils. 
Of these schools there were 81 for girls, with an attendance of 2,071. 
The number of secondary schools is not, however, as accurate a measure of the prog- 
ress of female education as the test by the number of pupils. In Bombay, for example, 
the secondary schools for girls are so large that, although few in number, they contain 
more pupils than those of any other province. The numbers of girls returned as 
being in the secondary stage of instruction in every province of India are here given: 
Madras, 389; Bombay, 555; Bengal, 211; Northwestern Provinces and Oude, 68; 
Punjab, 8. These figures are, of course, subject to whatever corrections may be ne- 
cessitated by the different range of what is known as secondary education in different 
provinces. 
The total expenditure for the secondary schools reported was : For the government 
schools, 1,893,441 rupees; for the aided schools, 1,706,576 rupees; for the unaided, 
427,181 rupees ; total, 4,027,198 rupees. These sums represented an average expense 
for each pupil in the three classes of schools as follows: For the first, 32 rupees 3 
pice; for the second 16 rupees 12 annas 1 pice; for the third, 12 rupees 8 annas 11. 
pice. The number of pupils from these schools who presented themselves for exam- 
ination was 25,200, of whom 11,716 met the requirements. 
_ As regards race or creed the pupils in the secondary schools were distributed as fol- 
lows: Hindoos, 176,306; Mahometans, 23,279; Sikhs, 564; Parsees, 2,722; native 
Christians, 5,526; Europeans and Eurasians in schools for natives of India, 775; 
others, 1,547; total, 210,719. | 
The total number of scholars learning English in the high and middle schools was 
130,541,

  Superior instruction.— Provision for superior instruction is made in English arts 
colleges and in Oriental colleges. The former in 1882 numbered 59, attended by 
5,399 students, of whom 2,735 presented themselves at the higher university exami- 
nations, and of these 1,137 met the requirements, The expenditure on these colleges 
in 188182 amounted to 1,352,783 rupees. The average expense for each pupil was, in 
departmental colleges, 354 rupees 9 annas 1 pice; in the aided colleges, 178 rupees 
7 annas 7 pice; and in the unaided colleges, 97 rupees 8 annas 2 pice. 
Between 1871 and 1882 the entire number of graduates was 3,311. From a partial 
statement of the after career of these graduates, it appears that 1,244 have entered 
the public service, 684 the legal profession, 225 the medical profession, and 53 the 
profession of civil engineering. 
The total number of Oriental colleges in India in 1882 was 11, having an attend- 
ance of 1,806 students. The expenditure upon these colleges in 1882 amounted to 
137,794 rupees. -The average expense for each student was, in the departmental col- 
leges, 46 rupees 6 pice; in the aided colleges, 247 rupees 7 annas 1 pice. 
General summary.—The number of colleges and schools, departmental aided and un- 
aided but inspected, thus brought under review is 87,052, attended by 2,284,608 pupils; 
to these may be added 25,166 private uninspected schools, with an attendance of 
359,370 pupils, giving a grand total of 112,218 institutions and 2,643,978 pupils. The 
pupils of the public schools and colleges were distributed according to race as fol- 
lows: Hindoos, 1,782,955; Mahometans, 399,711; Sikhs, 9,674; Parsees, 8,299; native 
Christians, 47,208; Europeans and Eurasians, 1,831; others, 34,930. The total ex- 
penditure on account of these public institutions was 16,110,282 rupees. The de- 
partmental returns for 1881~’82, including Ajmir and British Burmah, give a total of 
116,048 schools, with 2,760,080 pupils. 
In considering the magnitude of the work that remains to be done, the commis- 
sioners observe that the most advanced province of India (viz, Bombay) still fails to 
reach 75 per cent. of its male children of the schoolgoing age and 98 per cent. of its 
female children of that age. The census returns are equaily conclusive in this view. 
The male population of Ajmir and of the nine provinces with which the report of 
the commission deals exceeds 103,000,000, of whom 94,750,000 are illiterate; while 
of the female population, numbering about 99,700,000, no less than 99,500,000 are re- 
turned as unable to read or write. 
The recommendations of the commission form a valuable commentary on every — 
branch of service under consideration. The following are the recommendations under 
the specified heads which are likely to be of most general interest to those whose 
business it is to foster elementary education in other countries: 
Recommendations on indigenous education.—That all indigenous schools, whether high 
or low, be recognized and encouraged, if they serve any purpose of secular education 
whatsoever. 
Recommendations on primary education.—(1) That primary education be regarded as 
the instruction of the masses through the vernacular in such subjects as will best 
fit them for their position in life, and be not necessarily regarded as a portion of in- 
struction leading up to the university. * * * 
(3) That while every branch of education can justly claim the fostering care of the 
state, it is desirable, in the present circumstances of the country, to declare the ele- 
mentary education of the masses, its provision, extension, and improvement, to be 
that part of the educational system to which the strenuous efforts of the state should 
now be directed in a still larger measure than heretofore. 
(4) That an attempt be made to secure the fullest possible provision for, and exten- 
sion of, primary education by legislation suited to the circumstances of each province, * * * * * * * 
(6) That examinations by inspecting officers be conducted as far as possible in situ, 
and all primary schools receiving aid be invariably inspected in situ. 
(7) That, as a general rule, aid to primary schools be regulated to a large extent 
according to results of examination; but an exception may be made in the case of 
schools established in backward districts or under peculiar circumstances, which may 
be aided under special rules. 
(8) That schoui-lLouses and furniture be of the simplest and most economical kind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXLV 
(9) That the standards of primary examinations in each province be revised with 
a view to simplification and to the larger introduction of practical subjects, such as 
native methods of arithmetic, accounts and mensuration, the elements of natural and 
physical science, and their application to agriculture, health, and the industrial arts; 
but that no attempt be made to secure general uniformity throughout India. 
(10) That care be taken not “to interfere with the freedom of managers of aided 
schools in the choice of text books. 
(11) That promotion from class to class be not necessarily made to depend on the re- 
sults of one fixed standard of examinations, uniform throughout the province. 
(12) That physical development be promoted by the encouragement of native games, 
eyumasties, school drill, and other exercises suited to the circumstances of each class 
of school, © : 
(13) That all inspecting officers and teachers be directed to see that the teaching 
and discipline of every school are such as to exert a right influence on the manners, 
the conduct, and the character of the children, and that, for the guidance of the 
masters, a special manual be prepared. * * * 
(15) That the supply of normal schools, whether government or aided, be so local- 
ized as to provide for the local requirements of all primary schools, whether govern- 
ment or aided, within the division under each inspector. 
(16) That the first charges on provincial funds assigned for primary education be 
the cost of its direction and inspection and the provision of adequate normal schools. 
(17) That pupils in municipal or local board schools be not entirely exempted from 
payment of fees merely on the ground that they are the children of ratepayers. 
(18) That in all board schools a certain proportion cf pupils be admissible as free 
students on the ground of poverty, and in the case of special schools, established for 
the benefit of poorer classes, a general or larger exemption from payment of fees be 
allowed under proper authority for special reasons. 
(19) That, subject to the exemption of a certain proportion of free students on ac- 
count of bowery) fees, whether in money or kind, be levied in all aided schools, but 
the proceeds be left entirely at the disposa of the school managers. 
(20) That the principle laid down in Lord Hardinge’s resolution dated 11th Octo- 
ber, 1844, be reaffirmed, i.e., that in selecting persons to fill the lowest offices under 
government preference be always given to candidates who can read and write. 
(21) That the local governments, especially those of Bombay and of the North- 
western Provinces, be invited to consider the advisability of carrying out the sug- 
gestions contained in paragraph 96 of the dispatch of 1854, namely, of making some 
educational qualification necessary to the confirmation of hereditary village officers, 
such as patels and lambardars. 
(22) That night schools be encouraged wherever practicable. 
(23) That as much elasticity as possible be permitted, both as regards the hours of 
the day and the seasons of the year during which the attendance of scholars is re- 
quired, especially in agricultural villages and in backward districts. 
(24) That primary education be extended in backward districts, especially in those 
inhabited mainly by aboriginal races, by the instrumentality of the department pending 
the creation of school boards, or by specially liberal grants in aid to those who are 
willing to set up and maintain schools. 
(25) That all primary schools wholly maintained at the cost of the school boards, 
and all primary schools that are aided from the same fund and are not registered as 
special schools, be understood to be open to all castes and classes of the community. 
(26) That such a proportion between special and other primary schools be main- 
tained in each school district as to insure a proportionate provision for the education 
of all castes. 
(27) That assistance be given to schools and orphanages in which poor children are 
taught reading, writing, and counting, with or without manual work. 
(28) That primary ed acenn be declared to be that part of the whole system of 
public instruction which possesses an almost exclusive claim on local funds set apart 
for education, and a large claim on provincial revenues. * * * * * * * 
(32) That the general control over primary school expenditure be vested in the 
school boards, whether municipal or local, which may now exist or may hereafter 
be created for self government in each province. 
(33) That the first appointment of schoolmastersin municipal or local board schools 
be left to the town or district boards, with the proviso that the masters be certificated 
or approved by the department, and their subsequent promotion or removal be regu- 
lated by the boards, subject to the approval of the department. 
Recommendations on female education.—(1) That female education be treated as a 
legitimate charge alike on local,on municipal, and on provincial funds, and receive 
special encouragement. 
(2) That all female schools or orphanages, whether on a religious basis or not, be 
eligible for aid so far as they produce any secular results, such as a knowledge of 
reading or of writing.
-P-A-G-E-246
        CCXLVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
(8) That the conditions of aid to girls’ schools be easier than to boys’ schools and 
the rates higher, more especially in the case of those established for poor or for low 
caste girls. 
(4) That the rules for grants be so framed as to allow for the fact that girls’ schools 
generally contain a large proportion of beginners and of those who cannot attend 
school for so many hours a day or with such regularity as boys. 
(5) That the standards of instruction for primary girls’ schools be simpler than 
those for boys’ schools and be drawn up with special reference to the requirements 
of home life and to the occupations open to women. 
(6) That the greatest care be exercised in the selection of suitable text books for 
girls’ schools and that the preparation for such books be encouraged. 
(7) That, while fees be levied where practicable, no girls’ school be debarred from 
a grant on account of its not levying fees. ; 
(8) That special provision be made for girls’ scholarships, to be awarded after 
examination, and that, with a view to encouraging girls to remain longer at school, 
a certain proportion of them be reserved for girls not under twelve years of age. 
(9) That liberal aid be offered for the establishment in suitable localities of girls’ 
schools in which English should be taught in addition to the vernacular. 
(10) That special aid be given where necessary to girls’ schools that make provis- 
ion for boarders, : 
(11) That the department of public instruction be requested to arrange, in con- 
cert with managers of girls’ schools, for the revision of the code of rules for grants in 
aid, in accordance with the above recommendations. 
(12) That as mixed schools other than infant schools are not generally suited to 
the conditions of this country the attendance of girls at boys’ schools be not encour- 
aged, except in places where girls’ schools cannot be maintained. 
(13) That the establishment of infant schools or classes, under schoolmistresses, be 
liberally encouraged. 
(14) That female schools be not placed under the management of local boards 
or of municipalities unless they express a wish to take charge of them. 
(15) That the first appointment of schoolmistresses in girls’ schools under the man- 
agement of municipal or local boards be left to such boards, with the proviso that 
the mistress be either certificated or approved by the department, and that subse- 
quent promotion or removal be regulated by the boards, subject to the approval of the 
department. 
(16) That rules be framed to promote the gradual supersession of male by female 
teachers in all girls’ schools. 
(17) That in schools under female teachers, stipendiary pupil teacherships’ be 
generally encouraged. 
18) That the attention of local governments be invited to the question of estab- 
lishing additional normal schools or classes; and that those under private manage-

pupil passing the certificate examination. 
(19) That the departmental certificate examinations for teachers be open to all can- 
didates, wherever prepared. 
(20) That teachers in schools for general education be encouraged by special re- 
wards to prepare pupils for examination for teachers’ certificates, and that girls be 
encouraged by the offer of prizes to qualify for such certificates. 
’ (21) That liberal inducements be offered to the wives of schoolmasters to qualify 
as teachers, and that in suitable gases widows be trained as schoolmistresses, care 
being taken to provide them with sufficient protection in the places where they are 
to be employed as teachers. 
(22) That in districts where European or Eurasian young women are required as 
teachers in native schools special encouragement be given to them to qualify in a 
vernacular language. 
(23) That grants for zanana teaching be recognized as a proper charge on public 
funds and be given under rules which will enable the agencies engaged in that work 
to obtain substantial aid for such secular teaching as may be tested by an inspectress 
or other female agency. 
(24) That associations for the promotion of female education by examinations or 
otherwise be recognized by the department and encouraged by grants under suitable 
conditions. 
(25) That female inspecting agency be penance, as essential to the full develop- 
ment of female education aaa be more largely employed than hitherto. 
(26) That an alternative subject in examinations suitable for girls be established, 
corresponding in standard to the matriculation examination, but having no relation 
to any existing university course.

in female education on committees for the supervision of girls’ schools, and that Eu- 
ropean and native ladies be also invited to assist such committees.

JAPAN, absolute monarchy: Area, 48,456 square miles; population (1883), 36,700,118. Capital, Tokid; 
population, 823,557. Minister of public instruction, Count Oki-Takato. 
Organization.— Japan is divided into 9 circuits, and these are subdivided into 84 
provinces, besides the 2 islands, Ogasawara and Riukiu. For administrative pur- 
' poses, however, the country has 3 fu (imperial cities) and 44 ken (prefectures) ; these 
have minor divisions called ku and gun, which are further subdivided for local pur- 
poses into wards and villages. The population of school age in 1882 was 5,750,946. 
Besides the imperial household, there are a senate, a supreme court of judicature, 
and a privy council (daijékwan), under which are the 10 ministries of foreign affairs, 
interior, finance, war, marine, education, agriculture, commerce, public works, and 
justice. 
Elementary schools are managed asto local matters by ward and village committees, 
which are nominated by the citizens of the school district to the governor, and by him 
selected and appointed for not less than 4 years. Several wards or villages may unite 
to support a middle school or lower professional school, which is managed by a special 
committee selected and appointed in a similar manner. The committees and thegov- 
ernors of the administrative organization are supervised by the ministry of education, 
in which various secretaries, clerks, and vice ministers are under the orders of 
the minister. There are 11 bureaus in the ministry. 
The minister directs the application of laws, decrees, and regulations approved by 
the Emperor, drafts all such matters as require the imperial approval, and issues gen- 
eral or specific directions to the chiefs of his bureaus for the exact performance of 
their duties. With the help of his officers and inspectors he examines into the con- 
dition of all schools annually, and prepares the report for the information of the 
council andthe Emperor. All higher schools are directly under the supervision of the 
ministry of education, as are the curators of the principal libraries, museums, and 
other collections, :

Chief superintendent of education, William Crocket. 
According to the report of the superintendent for the year ending April 30, 1883, 
the total number of different pupils in attendance on the free schools was 64,581, an 
increase over the preceding year of 314, The proportion of the population of the 
province enrolled during the summer term, according to the census of 1881, was 1 in 
6.09, and during the winter term 1 in 6.34. The average monthly percentage of 
pupils daily present during the summer term was 73.45 and during the winter term 
78.03, During the summer term 1,480 teachers and assistants were employed. Of these

474 were men and 1,006 women. Of the whole number 1,206 were trained. The cor- 
responding numbers for the winter term were: Number of teachers and assistants, 
1,438, viz, 481 men and 957 women ; number trained, 1,196. 
The average rate of teachers’ salaries per annum, from all sources, compiled from 
the returns of the winter term for 1883, was as follows: Male teachers of the first 
class, $519.60; female teachers of the first class, $319.50; male teachers of the second 
class, $322.31; female teachers of the second class, $239.28; male teachers of the 
third class, $238.10; female teachers of the third class, $195.90. All of these rates 
show a slight increase over the same for 1882. 
There were in attendance at the normal school 191 student teachers, of whom 22 
belonged to the French preparatory department. 
The provincial grant for the school service for the year and six months ended 31st 
Occober, 1883, was $236,137.08. 
The legislature of the province, for a period extending over three-quarters of a 
century and more, has recognized the importance of secondary or intermediate educa- 
tion by the provision which it has made for its encouragement and support. Since 
1879 the aid extended has been in the form of a maximum annual grant, fixed at 
$7,000, which has been apportioned as 4 ‘superior allowance” to any common school 
fulfilling certain conditions, In the judgment of the present superintendent, these 
efforts have not accomplished the results intended, and he suggests a new plan of 
operations which he believes would prove more effective. 
b. Prince Epwarp Istanp: Area, 2,183 square miles; population (census 1881), 108,891. Capital, Char- 
lottetown; population, 8,807. Chief superintendent of education, D. Montgomery. 
According to the report for 1883 the number of public schools in the province was 
424; enrolment, 21,495, viz, 11,768 boys, 9,727 girls; average daily attendance, 11,7595 
number of teachers, 473, viz, 247 men, 226 women. The superintendent observes 
that public schools throughout the country are well attended, and that, with very 
few exceptions, the whole population between the ages of 5 and 16 is enrolled at 
school for some portion of the year. The record of the towns is not, he believes, 
quite so satisfactory. The estimated school population of Charlottetown and Royalty 
is 2,295; the enrolment in public, convent, and other schools, so far as known, is 
2,026, leaving 269 as the estimated number not attending any school. 
The average salaries for teachers ranged, for male teachers, from $226.90 for teachers 
of the third-class to $491.52 for teachers of the first class; for female teachers, from 
$162.16 for the third class to $295 for the first class. The highest salary paid any 
teacher was $1,000. 
In the Prince of Wales College and Normal School 130 students were enrolled, viz, 
36 non-professional and 94 in training for teachers. 
The total government expenditure for education was $101,193.41. 
¢. QUEBEC: Area, 188,688 square miles; population (census 1881), 1,359,027. Capital, Quebec; population, 
62,446. Superintendent of public instruction, Gédéon Ouimet. 
From the report of the superintendent for the scholastic year 1882~83 it appears 
that the number of schools under control was 5,017; number of pupils, 242,723; 
average attendance, 185,892, The following statements show (1) the distribution of

  The superintendent calls special attention to two suggestions made by the inspec- 
tors, The first is to determine the allotment of the subsidy granted by the legislature 
in proportion to the average attendance of the children at school, and not according to 
thecensus. Thesecond relates to certificates of capacity. It would consistin abolish- 
ing the diploma for primary and second class schools and retaining only model school 
diplomas and those granted by normalschools. With reference to the latter the super- 
jntendent observes: ‘It is founded on an undeniable pedagogical axiom, namely, that 
more cultivated fitness is required to teach a primary than to teach a model school.” 
It will be remembered that in order to meet the denominational differences of the 
people the school organization of Quebec is under the control of two committees, viz, 
the Catholic committee of the council of public instruction and the Protestant com- 
mittee, The report says: ‘ 
During the year a special effort has been made to increase the efficiency of the 
Protestant schools of the province by doing away with certain customs, such as board- 
ing around and frequent change of teachers, which prevailed in a large number of 
these schools. In order to secure the codperation of all those interested in these 
schools a conference of the Protestant inspectors was held at the department early in 
deanery, when a definite program of desirable improvements was adopted, which 
was to be urged upon the attention of the school commissioners, trustees, and teachers 
of the Protestant schools. The English secretary of the department then visited the 
Protestant sections of the province and discussed the proposed changes with the com- 
missioners and trustees of each county, who were called together for that purpose. 
The proposed improvements were very favorably received at these meetings and the 
recommendations were adopted in almost every instance, A circular containing the 
recommendations which had been generally accepted was accordingly issued to com- 
missioners and trustees of Protestant schools. 
Among other measures the circular recommends that the custom of boarding teach- 
ers around be dispensed with, that a uniform series of authorized text books be in-

sisted upon, that a course of study be provided for the guidance of elementary teach- 
ers, and, that the engagement of teachers be made upon a secure and permanent 
basis. 
The superintendent observes that the movement inaugurated by the Protestant 
committee for the improvement of the Protestant schools follows the same direction 
as that given to the Catholic schools of the province by the Catholic committee since 
1876. 
From the financial statement it appears that the sum received by the Roman Cath- 
olic school commissioners of the city of Montreal for the scholastic year 1882~83 was 
$154,866.80 and the sum disbursed by them was $146,238.72. The sums received and 
disbursed by the Protestant board of school commissioners for the same year were, 
respectively, $119,456.80 and $118,950.59. 
The report for 1842~83 contained information as to British Columbia and Ontario. 
Later information has been received from those two provinces, and also from Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, and Manitoba, but too late for notice in this report. 
Mexico, federal republic: Area, 743,048 square miles; population (1882), 10,046,872. Capital, Mexico; 
population (1882), about 300,000. Secretary of justice and instruction, J. Baranda. 
The date of the latest statistics from Mexico is 1875 (see Report of Commissioner of 
Education for 1882~’83), but certain items of general information as regards the edu- 
cational institutions of that country, particularly of the City of Mexico, are presented 
for 188384. Tn an address delivered on December 31, 1883, by Sefior Rafael Gallardo, 
president of the school board of the City of Mexico, an account is given of the diffi- 
culties encountered by the ayuntamiento in the discharge of their duties as guardians 
of primary education. The efforts made by them toward the more general diffusion 
of knowledge and toward improvement of the present system of instruction are also 
spoken of. Lack of means is deplored, and yet, in spite of inadequate funds, seven 
new schools were opened during the year, making a total of 88 under the immediate 
superintendence of the city council. An increase over the preceding year of 2,061 in 
the attendance of pupils and of $31,637 in expenditure is noticed. The salaries of 
teachers are paid punctually and the profession is held in high esteem. There is no 
law for compulsory education in Mexico, although it is believed that one will be 
passed ere long, as education is now considered to be of great importance, and not to 
be made subservient to any other branch. Sefior Gallardo referred with pride to the 
vast improvements being made in the system of instruction; a few years ago, while 
the government institutions were enjoying the highest advantages, conducted on a 
plan that was almost perfect, and producing results that surpassed many of the 
European colleges, the primary schools were comparatively neglected, the only step 
toward progress being the introduction of the Belland Lancaster method. The ayun- 
tamiento awakening to the importance of keeping pace with the revolution that had 
taken place in Europe, and especially in Germany, in regard to elementary instruc- 
tion, resolved to introduce the objective and Kindergarten systems. The Mexicans 
gave the plan careful study and commenced by educating a corps of teachers who 
would be able to put it into efficient practice. For this purpose they founded the 
Academia de Pedagogia, composed entirely of professors (male and female) who have 
made a thorough study of the subject, both theoretically and practically. The new 
system has been introduced with great success in the schools, and it is thought will 
be universally adopted. An infant school, to aid the laboring class, has also been 
started. The children are kept there during the day while their parents are at work, 
and are taught the elements. Another interesting institution is the night school for 
workingmen, which has an attendance of 184. Among the benevolent institutions is 
La Cuifia, a foundling hospital, which is divided into three departments, one for boys, 
one for girls, and a third for infants of either sex. The little ones are furnished with 
playthings; the larger ones are taught the branches of a primary,education, as well 
as music, drawing, and all kinds of sewing. The ‘‘ Hospicio” is another establish- 
ment, which contains some 800 boys and girls whose parents are either dead or unable
-P-A-G-E-253

to care for them. The elements of instruction are given in the building, and later 
the pupils are sent to the schools of arts and trades mentioned below. Sewing, 
lace work, and embroidery are also taught. Mexico is doing much toward educating 
her daughters, and the schools devoted to girls enjoy similar advantages to those 
for boys. The higher colleges, such as the preparatory school of San Ildefonso, 
have opened their doors to women, and quite a number have entered. The School of 
Arts and Trades for Women numbers 368 regular attendants, varying in age from 
girls of twelve up to women of middle age, Every kind of instruction is free of 
charge; all materials and apparatus for work are likewise provided. The government 
also furnishes two substantial meals each day. Further assistance is given by offi- 
cials, who give orders for upholstery, book-binding, and also clothing for the eharita- 
ble institutions of the city. Several hours each morning are devoted to the primary 
branches and book-keeping. Vocal and instrumental music and painting are tanght. 
Moulding and gilding, manufacture of artificial flowers, printing, embroidery, manu- 
facture of trimmings, fringes, cords, &c., enter into the course. At Guadalajara, there 
is a similar school, where women are taught printing, photography, lithegraphy, ste- 
nogtaphy, tailoring, shoemaking, and stocking and cloth weaving. ‘ 
The Escuela de Artes y Oficios (for men) in the City of Mexico is somewhat similar 
to the one described above for women. In the morning primary studies, the higher 
branches, and mathematics are pursued; French is obligatory. The school contains 
170 boys, and the government spends about $48,000 annually on it, $12,000 being 
allowed yearly for the purchase of machinery, necessary apparatus, &c. Everything 
is free, and there are 50 scholarships, an allowance of $30 a month being given to the 
boys filling them. These scholarships are extended to all the national academies, 
the school of agriculture having 100 at its disposal, the preparatory 20, another 
school 10, and soon. When a boy has made good use of his opportunities he is al- 
lowed this pension for'5 years. A certain number of boys are also sent either to 
Europe or the United States, where they are permitted to stay 5 years, with amonthly 
allowance of $50. In this School of Arts and Trades much attention is devoted to car- 
pentry, the art of pottery, working in iron and brass, in electro-metallurgy, photogra- 
phy, lithography, and printing. There is also a gymnasium, where the boys are ex- 
pected to exercise daily. Music and drawing are among the studies, 
Two reformatory institutions are doing good work, viz, the Tecpara Reformatory, 
Santiago, and the correctiona! school of San Pedro y San Pablo. In the first mentioned 
the educational advantages are excellent, as the professors who give instruction in the 
various arts and trades are among the best in Mexico. Carpentry, weaving, shoemak- 
ing, printing, and tailoring are taught, and there is a complete orchestra. The insti- 
tution of San Pedro y San Pablo contains 300 pupils who are taken from the dregs of 
the population. There is a regular school course and the different trades are taught. 
The boys are also put through a course of military drill. 
Just as this report is going to press the Office is the recipient of a series of maps, 
diagrams, &c., bearing on education in Mexico and prepared for the Mexican exhibit 
at the exposition in New Orleans. They were kindly furnished by Sefior Fernando 
Ferrari Perez, naturalist of the Mexican geographical exploring commission, presi- 
dent of the State University of Puebla de Zaragoza. The following statistics are 
taken from the chart of primary school instruction in the federal district, which 
includes the city of Mexico, the prefectures of Tlalpam, Tacubaya, Guadalupe Hi- 
dalgo, and Xochimileo; it was prepared by Sefior Rafael Perez Gallardo, member of 
the special committee from that district to the New Orleans Exposition. 
‘The number of primary schools was 400, with 657 male and 362 women professors, 
167 male assistants and 165 female assistants. In these schools were 15,771 boys and 
12,017 girls. The expenditures amounted to $341,032.!_ It may be well to state that 
these numbers cover both public and private institutions. Some are schools for 
adults, others for children. These figures show the state of the educational system 
of the federal district down to September, 1884,

GUATEMALA, republic: Area, 41,880 square miles; population (1883), 1,276,961. Capital, Santiago de 
Guatemala; population, 55,728. 
From the Informe dirijido al sefior secretario de fomento, sobre los trabajos practi- 
cados por la oficina de estadistica en el afio de 1884 it is learned that $337,235 were 
appropriated for public instruction in 1883, of which $329,439 were appropriated by 
the state and $7,796 by the municipalities. 
The following account of the condition of education is taken from the Anales esta- 
Gisticos de la Reptiblica de Guatemala. Afio de 1883. Tomo II: 
Primary instruction.—The government of Guatemala, by a decree of December 13, 
1879, guaranteed liberty of instruction, made primary education obligatory and lay 
and at public expense, and provided that reading, practical elements of the language 
of the country, object lessons, writing and linear drawing, geography and history, and 
morals and politeness should be taught in the elementary schools. Moreover, a course 
of complementary instruction was provided for those who wished to transcend the limits 
of primary instruction, and in this course Spanish grammar, book-keeping, elements 
of natural history, geography, and the history of Central America were taught. 
In 1883 there were 850 free public primary schools, of which 540 were elementary 
schools for boys, 230 for girls, 16 were mixed, 47 were night schools for artisans (men), 
lanight school for work girls, and 1a Sunday school for the latter.’ The complementary 
schools numbered 5 for boys and 4for girls. The attendance was 39,642 pupils, 27,974 
males and 11,668 females, and 735 male and 302 female teachers were employed. The 
appropriation was $241,499, so that each pupil cost an average of $6.09 a year. 
There is a system of school inspection, and the reports of the inspector led to a cor- 
rection of defects in instruction, &c., where any were found. Pedagogical confer- 
ences are also mentioned, which were attended by a large number of teachers. The 
private primary schools numbered 55, of which 48 were elementary and 7 comple- 
mentary, and had an attendance of 1,870 pupils. They were supported at an expense 
of $79,210, supplied by private individuals, and an appropriation from the govern- 
ment of $4,944, making a total of $84,154, 
Secondary instruction.— The institutions of secondary instruction are established by 
the law of public instruction for amplifying the knowledge and instruction given in 
the elementary and complementary schools. Normal schools are included in the sec- 
ondary grade. Subjects of practical utility, such as modern languages, book-keeping, 
mechanics, &c., are included in the secondary course, in addition to those which are 
continuations of the elementary course. 
The most important of the secondary schools is the National Central Institute for 
Young Men, at Guatemala, which has a physical and chemical laboratory, a minera- 
logical and geological collection, &c., and a collection of all the products of the coun- 
try. This institution had a director and 27 teachers in the school year 188384 and 259 
students. The Central Institute for Young Women, which also has a physical and 
chemical laboratory and a large collection of scientific maps, had a principal and 10 
teachersin 1883 and 112 pupils. There are 3 othersecondary institutions in the country, 
which had 1 principal each and a total of 39 teachers and 336 students in 1883. The 
total expenditure was $79,528, 
Professional and special instruction.— The law school, the medical school, and the 
engineering school at Guatemala and the law school at Quezaltenango had 40 pro- 
fessors and 133 students, of whom 52 were law students, 70 were medical, and 11 were 
students of engineering. These institutions cost $24,903 in 1883. 
The special institutions are the national school of music, with 1 director and 6 
teachers and 66 students in 1883; the business college, with 6 teachers, besides the 
director, and 50 students; a deaf-mute college, with 1 teacher and 1 director and 9 
students; a drawing school, with a director and 1 teacher and 62 students, and a 
school of arts and trades, with a principal, 6 teachers, and 55 students. These insti- 
tutions received an appropriation of $21,726,

According to the Memoria de relaciones exteriores, instruccién ptiblica, justiciay gra- 
cia, culto y beneficencia, primary instruction is gratuitous, obligatory, and in charge of 
the state in this republic. Inthe province of San José 54 schools were reported, with 
a total of 3,062 pupils. The course of study embraces reading, orthoepy, writing, or- 
thography, arithmetic, geometry, history, geography, Castilian grammar, Christian 
doctrine and morals, and, in the schools for girls, needlework and embroidery. In 
the province of Cartago 39 schools and 2,893 pupils are found. The branches are 
reading writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, morals, and religion. The girls 
in all the proyinces have instruction in needlework and embroidery. In the province 
of Alajuela reading, writing, religion, morals, politeness, profane and sacred history, 
Castilian grammar, elements of geography and geometry are taught in the 71 schools 
to 3,345 pupils. The province of Heredia has 30 schools and 1,973 children in attend- 
ance. The course of study is the same asin the province of Cartago. The Guanacaste 
province has 35 schools and 1,114 pupils. Here the studies vary according to the schools. 
In the central schools for boys they are reading, writing, .atithmetic, grammar, geog- 
raphy, geometry, sacred history, religion, morals, and politeness. In the central 
schools for girls the studies are the same, except geometry, which isreplaced by handi- 
work. In the elementary district schools for boys, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
religion, morals, politeness, and sacred history are taught; in those for girls, handiwork 
isadded. Inthe district of Puntarenas, which includes Puntarenas, Esparta, and Nan- 
ces, there 5 schools and 250 pupils. The course of study comprises reading, writing, 
arithmetic, geography, religion, Castilian grammar, morals,and sacred history, A 
Jack of competent teachers is spoken of for the primary grades and the suggestion is 
offered that a normal school be created in each province so as to produce a finer 
corps of teachers. 
Secondary instruction is represented by the following colleges: The Instituto Univer- 
sitario de San José, which was opened May 4, 1884, has courses leading to bachelor 
and master of arts, and preparatory literary and scientific courses; the Colegio de 
San Luis Gonzaga, founded in 1869, and having 106 pupils in 1883; the College of 
San Augustin, in the province of Heredia, with 22 pupils and a 6-year course; the 
College Seminary of the Compafiia de San Vicente de Paul, a 6-year course, leading 
to B. A. and M. A.; the Colegios de Nuestra Sefiora de Sién, for girls, situated in 
San José and Alajuela ; the Colegio del Sagrado Corazé6n de Jestis, which had prepara- 
tory, middle, and superior classes, with 112 pupils in 1884; the Colegio Central, which 
had 78 pupilsin the preparatory and higher division ; and the Colegio Josefino, from 
which no information was received. In the colleges for boys there are courses in the 
humanities, philosophy, industries, agriculture, and commerce according toregulations 
of 1869. Still up to the present time the courses have been mainly literary, owing to 
the lack of proper apparatus for scientific branches. Changes are to be made, how- 
ever, in this matter, and a bill is under discussion to reform secondary education, 
while, in regard to primary instruction, a delegate has been sent to New York to study 
the American system with the object of making material changes in that grade. 
Professional instruction is limited to the faculty of jurisprudence, created by law of 
July 4, 1874, and that of civil engineering, by law of November 17 and 18, 1831, al- 
though it is intended soon to open schools of medicine, surgery, and pharmacy. The 
Universidad de Santo Toms, however, has courses for both secondary and professional 
instruction, and considerable apparatus for natural and physical sciences and mathe- 
matics has been gathered together here. The reason stated for the lack of professional 
schools is that many students in the numerous secondary schools are required by their 
parents to enter into agriculture or commerce as a means of livelihood and no oppor- 
tunity is given to continue in higher branches of education,

population (February, 1884), 283,758. Minister of justice, worship, and public instruction, Dr. 
Eduardo Wilde. President of the national council of education, Dr. Benjamin Zorriila.    
An important movement in education was the promulgation of the law on public 
education on July 8, 1884. The following is a summary of the leading features of 
the law: The school age is from 6 to 14 years and primary instruction is obligatory, 
free, and graded, and must be given in accordance with the principles of hygiene. 
Instruction may be given in public or private schools or at home and is to be tested 
by examinations. Attendance will be enforced by admonition and fines, and, in ex- 
treme cases, children may be taken to school by the authorities. In the cities every 
neighborhood of from 1,000 to 1,500 persons, and in the country every neighborhood 
of from 300 to 500 persons, constitutes a school district and is entitled to at least one 
public school, in which the primary instruction prescribed by the present law shall be 
given in all itsextent. This obligatory instruction comprises the following subjects 
as a minimum: reading and writing, arithmetic (the first four rules for whole 
numbers, the decimal metric system, and the national law for money, weights, and 
measures), geography of the Argentine Republic and elements of general geography, 
history of the republic and elements of general history, native language, morals 
and politeness, elements of hygiene, of mathematics, physics, and natural history, 
elements of drawing and vocal music, gymnastics, and the national constitution. Girls 
are also obliged to learn handiwork and the rudiments of domestic economy and boys 
must receive instruction in light military exercises and, in the country districts, in 
agriculture and stock raising. Religious instruction is to be given by the authorized 
ministers of different sects to the children of their respective faiths before or after 
school hours. Children from 6 to 10 years old will be taught, preferably in mixed 
schools, by female teachers. Besides the common primary schools (divided into in- 
fant, elementary, and superior schools), Kindergarten, adult, and ambulatory schools 
are established in suitable districts in town and country, as found desirable. In 
building school-houses and providing furniture and material for them the princi- 
ples of hygiene are to be observed. Medical and hygienic inspection of schools is 
obligatory, as is also vaccination of the pupils at certain periods. An annual census 
is to be taken of all persons in charge of children of school age, giving the number, 
age, sex, and religion of such persons and the domicile of the children. Persons not 
complying with this section of the law will be fined, as will also teachers who receive 
unenrolled children into their schools. A register of attendance must also be strictly 
kept. Non-attendance at school will be punished and complete school statistics are 
provided for. Public school teachers are required to possess certificates or diplomas 
of capacity as graduates of normal schools, or, if foreigners, they must obtain them 
from the school authorities. They are required to teach according to the prescribed 
programs, attend lectures on pedagogies, keep the registers of attendance, statistics, 
é&c., and are forbidden to receive any emolument from the parents of the children, 
award any unauthorized prizes, inflict corporal punishment, or exercise any calling 
which may interfere with their duties as teachers. Provision is made for pen- 
sioning teachers who have become incapable of further service. Twice a year the 
primary schools of each district are to be inspected with a view to ascertaining their 
actual condition in respect to instruction and their conformity to the requirements of 
hygiene. A permanent common school fund is established by setting aside a percentage 
of the amounts received from the sale of public lands, from fines, &c. The administra- 
tion and direction of schools is in charge of the national council of education, which 
is established at Buenos Ayres under the ministry of public instruction. This council 
is required to submit an annual report to the minister and has full control over all 
school affairs in the country. The council held a hundred sessions in 1884, reports of 
which are published in E] Monitor de la Educacion Comun, which contained the law 
above given.

The following statistics of primary education are taken from the Informe sobre el - 
estado de la educacion comun en la capital, provincias, colonias y territorios na- 
cionales, durante el afio 1883, by Dr. D. B. Zorrilla, president of the national council: 
Nine new schools were erected in the capital district during 1883; the maximum en- 
rolment was 23,586 and attendance 20,050, against 21,698 and 17,885, respectively, the 
previous year. Adding the figures for private schools to the above, it is found that 
there was a total enrolment of 35,265, with a mean attendance of 30,387. The school 
population was 51,785. The average of public schools of all kinds in operation in the 
capital during the year was 170, with a maximum of 175 in July and a minimum of 
152in December. The average number of teachers was 500, the average enrolment was 
21,906, and attendance 18,787. The average monthly outlay for salaries, rents, &c., was 
34,261.56 pesos fuertes. There were 118 private schools, with 545 teachers, 11,679 en- 
rolled pupils, and an attendance of 10,337. The following is a statement of the con- 
dition of primary education in all the provinces of the republic as far as the number 
of schools, teachers, and pupils can show it. The table does not include normal 
schools and national colleges, which are said to have increased in the last few years, 
because such institutions are without the jurisdiction of the authority which pre- 
pared the report.

BRaziL, constitutional empire: Area, 3,287,964 square miles; population, 9,930,478. Capital, Rio de 
Janeiro; population, 274,972. 
From a long and interesting article on education in Brazil by F. J. de Santa-Anna 
Nery, published in the Revue Pédagogique of September 15, 1884, the following 
statements are taken : 
No statistical tables embracing the whole country have been published since 1876, 
and yet since that date there have been great developments in public instruction. 
For instance, in the province of Pard, where there were only 131 public primary. 
schools in 1872, there were in 1882 more than double that number; that is, 267, In 
the province of the Amazon the public primaries numbered. 23 in 1872, with 782 
pupils, to 92 in 1882, with 2,470 children in attendance, and more than a dozen others 
have been established since then. In 1869 the whole empire had 3,516 public pri- 
mary schools and 115,735 pupils ; that is, 1 school to 2,394 free inhabitants in a 
total population of 8,419,672 free citizens. According to the census of 1872 there were 
1,902,424 persons of school age (6 to 15), and on this basis Brazil had in 1869 1 school 
to 541 children. In 1876 the 6,000 primary grades had 200,000 pupils, or 1 school to 
1,250 inhabitants or to 314 children of school age. This shows for the period men- 
tioned an increase of 2,500 schools and 85,000 pupils. Evening schools for adults are 
not included in the above. There were 117 of these, of primary grade, in 1876 to 1 in 
1869, The capital of Brazil had 1 school to 210 persons of school age in 1876. In 1879 
a decree of the minister of the interior, education, and worship made primary educa- 
tion even more liberal than before (gratuitous instruction existed since 1824 and ob- 
ligatory instruction in many provinces for a long time), as absolute liberty of in- 
struction was guaranteed; any person could teach whatever he wished without having 
a certificate, the only requisite being attention to morals and hygiene, and by this 
decree primary instruction became obligatory for children between 7 and 14 years of 
age. The following table is stated to be quite complete for the provinces of the em- 
pire as showing the present state of primary and secondary education in Brazil:

Secondary instruction is regulated by the same laws as primary education, so far as 
the principles of decentralization are concerned, but it is not gratuitous. The govern- 
ment interferes only in regulating the branches required for admission to superior 
schools. Still the State supports two establishments for secondary instruction in the 
provinces, viz, the preparatory courses annexed to the faculties of law of Sio Paulo 
and Pernambuco, In other cases the secondary schools depend for their maintenance 
on the local authorities. In the city of Rio de Janeiro, where all grades of instruc- 
tion receive state aid, there are several kinds of secondary schools. Some are public 
institutions in charge of the state, others private, and yet others subsidized by 
the state, but retaining their own entity. The first of these state institutions is 
the Imperial College of Dom Pedro II. It has elementary and secondary divisions. 
Portuguese, French, English, Italian, German, Greek, religion, geography, cosmogra- 
phy, chorography of Brazil, general and national history, mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, natural history, rhetoric, literature (national and foreign), and philosophy 
are taught. On the conclusion of the course the student receives the degree of B. 
LIT. (bachelier és-lettres), which-admits to higher schools without other examina- 
tion. This is the only establishment conferring this degree. About 400 pupils attend 
annually. Among the institutions subsidized by the state the Pharmaceutical Insti- 
tute has about 400 pupils. It has a course in humanities, leading to the higher schools. 
In 1881 there were 62 private secondary schools in Rio de Janeiro, 27 for boys and 35 
for girls. More than 3,000 pupils attended. Each province has at least one lyceum 
in its principal town. In all Brazil there are about. 350 private secondary schools. 
Special attention is paid to the modern languages in these schools,

ccLx REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  Superior instruction is under state control. Within the past few years great prog- 
ress has been made in this grade of instruction in Brazil. Special chairs have been 
founded, cabinets of physics and chemistry established, fine laboratories have been 
arranged, so as to give practical instruction, and the polytechnic school has been re- 
organized. The principal establishments for superior education in Brazil are the two 
faculties of law at Sio Paulo and Pernambuco, the two faculties of medicine at Rio de 
Janeiro and Bahia, the Polytechnic of Rio de Janeiro, and the School of Mines of Ouro 
Preto. Each of the legal courses is 5 years in length and each has 11 chairs, occupied 
by professors who have 6 assistants or substitutes. The students become bachelors 
of law at the end of 5 years. The two faculties of medicine, and especially that of 
Rio, have experienced a radical change within the last 4 years, and much progress 
has been made in practical instruction. Additional laboratories have been arranged, 
new chairs have been created, &c. No one may practise medicine in Brazil unless he 
has the degree of doctor of medicine. The polytechnic school of Rio de Janeiro hasa 
preparatory school, a general course, and 6 special courses. Students on finishing the 
course chosen receive either the diploma of bachelor of physical and natural sciences 
or that of topographical, civil, mining, or mechanical engineer. During vacations the 
students are taken out on excursions by the professors. The School of Mines at Ouro 
Preto, in the province of Minas Geraes, is of recent date. It was established in 1876 
and the instruction is entirely gratuitous. The school receives aid from the state and 
a subsidy from the provincial government. There are 3 courses of study, each of 1 
year. The school has already sent out a corps of mining engineers, whose work in the 
mines of the province is considered valuable. In connection with this higher grade 
of education there are courses at the national museum, and in 1882 a Brazilian an- 
thropological exhibition was organized by M. L. Netto, the director, and fine work is 
done at the astronomical observatory, and also at Rio de Janeiro. 
Special instruction is given in state institutions, in institutions under provincial 
charge, and in many private establishments. Among the state schools are the mili- 
tary schools of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul and the naval institute at Rio 
de Janeiro. Preparatory courses and courses in the humanities are annexed to the 
military schools and diplomas for mathematics and for military engineering are con- 
ferred. The preparatory course in the military school at Rio de Janeiro covers Portu- 
guese, French, English, elementary mathematics, geography, history, and linear draw- 
ing. A higher course is of 5 years in duration and leads to the diploma of military 
engineer. The other military school has a 3-year course. The naval school has pre- 
paratory and higher courses, the latter 4 years in length. Other special schools are 
the School of Fine Arts, the Conservatory of Music at Rio de Janeiro, the Asylum for 
Abandoned Children, in the same city, the Agricultural Asylum at Rio, the rural es- 
tablishment of St. Pierre d’Alcantara, in the province of Piauhy, which has as object 
the educating of former slaves and their descendants, freed by law of September 28, 
1871, and the Imperial Institute of Bahia. This last establishment has cabinets of 
physics and chemistry, a collection of models for study of veterinary science and com- 
parative anatomy, and a library containing 8,000 volumes. A course in agronomy 
has been founded here, with a 4-year course of study. In 1883 there were 24 pupils in 
the elementary courses and 45 in'the agronomical course. A model farm is annexed 
to this school. In 1884 a French veterinary surgeon was engaged by the Brazilian 
government to found a veterinary and agricultural school at Rio Grande do Sul. 
A certain number of provinces maintain well established technical schools. The 
Amazon province has a professional school (Instituto Amazonense), with about 150 
receiving elementary and professional instruction. Other establishments of the proy- 
ince are an orphan asylum and an agricultural course annexed to the botanical mu- 
seum. Inthe province of Minas Geraes, at Ouro Preto, there is a pharmaceutical course 
of 3 years’ duration, with 6 chairs; at Serro, a small lyceum of arts and trades; at 
Piracicaba, a school of agriculture. In the province of Paré a professional school, In- 
stituto de Educandos, has 92 pupils. There are similar establishments in other prov- 
inces, Two private institutions merit mention on account of their organization. . The

first is at Rio de Janeiro, where, under the title of Lyceum of Arts and Trades, it 
groups together a number of professors who give gratuitous instruction in their spe- 
cialties. Foreigners and natives of both sexes are admitted to the courses. This es- 
tablishment is in a fine edifice, has all the apparatus necessary for the instruction 
given, and is maintained mostly by private individuals, although the state gives a 
certain sum to assist in supporting it. The second of these institutions is the School 
of Agriculture, Arts, and Trades, founded by the bishop of Paré, near the principal 
town of the province. There are a number of well appointed shops connected with 
this establishment. In the past year an international pedagogical exposition was 
organized at Rio de Janeiro. This exposition was crowned with success, although 
its organizers only depended on private funds. A permanent school museum was es- 
tablished as a result of this exhibition. Although so much has been done for educa- 
tion in Brazil, it is stated that technical education is not yet sufficiently developed, 
while education in general suffers from a lack of experienced teachers. 
CHILI: Republic; area, 256,399 square miles ; population (1882), 2,271,949. Capital, Santiago; popula- 
tion, 200,000. Minister of justice, worship, and public instruction, José I. Vergara, 
The following is a brief summary of a report on education made by the Chilian 
minister of justice, worship, and public instruction to the national congress in 1884 
(Memoria del ministro de justicia, culto e instruccion ptiblica, presentada al congreso 
nacional en 1884): 
Primary instruction.—The inspector general of schools was commissioned by the 
government to visit Europe and engage directors and teachers for the normal schools 
of Chili, in order to introduce a systematic reform in the methods of instruction in 
those schools. The salaries for directors are fixed at 3,000 pesos ($2,736),; 1,500 
pesos ($1,368) for male teachers; for directresses, 2,400 pesos ($2,188); for assist- 
ant directresses, 1,500 pesos ($1,368), and for female teachers 1,000 pesos ($912) a year. 
Besides this importation of foreign teachers students of the normal schools were sent 
to Europe during the year 1884 to complete their studies under a contract to teach in 
primary branches for 7 years after their return. 
Appropriations for school buildings during the scholastic year amounted to 200,000 
pesos ($182,400), and 30,000 pesos ($27,360) were appropriated for text books, material 
for teaching, and school furniture. The normal school for males had 120 students at 
the close of the scholastic year. Fourteen persons obtained certificates as teachers 
at the close of the 4-year course. The normal school for females at Santiago had 
79 students and that at Chillan 28 students during the scholastic year. 
The number of public schools at the close of 1883 was 736, divided as follows:

    CCLXIT_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The private schools numbered 495, of which 186 were boys’ schools, 122 girls’ schools, 
and 187 were mixed. These schools were attended by 13,125 boys and 9,783 girls, 
making a total of 22,908.

oudary institutions in 1883 and 1884: \

This shows a total increase of 210 from 1883 to 1884. The lycées of Copiapé oa 
Serena, which show the greatest falling off in attendance, are in the mining districts 
of the country, where the population is less stable than elsewhere, and a table of the 
attendance at those institutions from 1880 shows wide fluctuations from year to year, 
but with a total increase. The total number of examinations in all these institutions 
was 11,072, with 1,813 rejections, or 16 per cent. of the total. 
The course of study in these lycées comprises Latin, Spanish, English, Freih, 
Italian, German, geography, arithmetic, elements of algebra and trigonometry, Ds 
ometry and lineal drawing, book-keeping, elements of physics and chemistry tc 
mechanics, natural history and physical geography, philosophy, sacred history and 
the catechism, history of America and Chili, ancient Greek and Roman history, mod- 
ern history, and the contemporary history of America and Chili. In some of thema 
practical turn is given to the instruction by inducing the students to form herba- 
riums, draw maps, solve problems, prepare essays, &c. The Chilian legation at Paris 
has forwarded the collection of books purchased for the libraries of the lycées. The 
collection cost 15,000 pesos (about $14,000), and was selected by a commission of com- 
petent persons skilled in various branches of learning. 
Superior instruction.—The minister gives an account of the various regulations sub- 
mitted to the government by the council of public instruction during the preceding 
scholastic year affecting the classification of studies, examinations, prizes, &c., in differ. 
ent faculties of the university and defining the rights and duties of the rector and pro- 
tor. The council proposed the creation of new classes for superior instruction in ma’ 
matics and allied sciences, among which are those of mechanics and the construction 
of machinery and an auxiliary class of inorganic chemistry. For the first of these a

professor had already been provided, and instractions were given to the Chilian lega- 
tion in Germany to engage the services of a professor to give instruction in inorganic 
chemistry, in addition to the regular professor of that branch of study. The auxiliary 
class was made necessary by the increasing number of students of medicine and math- 
ematics who wished to study chemistry. Owing to the great development which 
chemistry, mineralogy, and geology have made in recent years it was deemed advis- 
able to obtain the services of more than one professor in Germany., Accordingly a 
professor of inorganic and analytical chemistry (including assaying and mineralogy) 
is to be obtained from Freiberg, and the Chilian minister is looking for another to give 
instruction in geology and allied branches, subjects which have been hitherto some- 
what neglected in the university course in Chili. The number of students in the dif- 
ferent faculties during 1883~84 was as follows: Law, 349; medicine, 256; mathemat- 
ics, 21; pharmacy, 90; fine arts, 62; total, 778. The small number of students in the 
mathematical faculty is accounted for by the rector as being partly due to the slight 
esteem in which the title of engineer is held ifthe degree has been obtained in Chili 
and to the preference given to foreign engineers for directing private and: public 
works. Persons studying engineering in the university of the National Institute of 
Chili do not have the same opportunities of studying practical applications of that 
branch as others who have studied in Europe or the United States. To remedy this 
defect, improved apparatus, instruments, machinery, &c., have been purchased in Eu- 
rope, the physical laboratory is being supplied with material of constant use in the 
arts, and two students of the university have been selected to pursue a 3-year 
course of study in Europe, one to devote himself to general and analytical chemistry 
(including assaying), mineralogy, and geology, and the other to mechanics and the con- 
struction of machines. These students will be qualified to teach the branches men- 
tioned on their return to Chili and supply vacancies in the corps of professors. Dur- 
ing the scholastic year there were 2,279 examinations, distributed into 1,157 in 
the faculty of law, 993 in the medical, and 129 in the mathematical faculties. The re- 
sults were: 1,014 candidates passed and 143 were rejected in the faculty of law, 811 
passed and 182 rejected in the medical faculty, and 102 passed and 27 rejected in the 
mathematical faculty. This makes a total of 1,927 successful candidates and 352 re- 
jected, the latter thus amounting to a little over 15 per cent. of the total number of 
candidates. 
The university library contains 7,619 volumes and is constantly increasing by gifts 
and otherwise. Between the years 1878 and 1884 accessions to the library amounted 
to 1,532 volumes, mostly contributed by the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. 
About 200 volumes of the total number are upon medical subjects, 350 are devoted to 
law, 1,500 to literature, history, travels, &c., and the rest to the natural sciences and 
mathematics. 
Special institutions.— The national library has 65,094 volumes of all kinds and was 
consulted by 6,492 readers from April, 1883, to April, 1884. A commission was ap- 
pointed by the government the preceding year to recommend the purchase of books 
for the library. The matter was placed in charge of the Chilian legation at Paris 
and many of the books bought by it had been received in the course of the year 1884. 
The director of the national observatory was placed in charge of the newly organ- 
ized meteorological service in March, 1884, Daily observations were ordered and the 
results were telegraphed to the observatory and published as soon as reduced. 
Chili sent the director of the hydrographic bureau as a delegate to the meridian con- 
ference at Washington. 
The director of the national museum has recommended a scientific expedition to 
collect specimens of the fauna and flora of the newly acquired provinces of Chili, which 
are as yet little known. 
The conservatory of music had 389 students in 1884, of whom 94 were males and 
295 females. 
The government took steps during the year towards a reorganization of the school

of arts and industries. The master of the machine shop was sent to Europe to pur. 
chase material and visit the more important industrial establishments of the conti- 
nent. Two students were also sent to Europe to study steam engineering and foundry 
work. After their return they are to serve as heads of those departments in the 
school for seven years. The new director of the schoolis a graduate of tho Ecole 
Centrale of Paris and has had practical experience in his profession in France. The 
amount appropriated for the purchase of new machinery, tools, and material was 
14,000 pesos (nearly $12,800). The value of the material in May, 1884, was 84,612 
pesos ($77,166). 
Among the private schools may be mentioned the Santiago College for Young Ladies 
and Young Men, which gives instruction from American text books, &c., and employs 
American teachers. 
The statistics of schools is made up from the report of the inspector general of pub- 
lic instruction, under whose authority the visits to the schools are now made. The 
report not only gives the school statistics, but explains the principles to be followed 
in selecting sites for buildings, in estimating the amount of floor space per pupil, and 
in ordering the interior arrangements of the buildings, and discusses other kindred 
subjects in a way which shows that the educational authorities of Chili are alive to 
the modern questions of school hygiene. 
The Bureau is also in receipt of addresses on pedagogical subjects delivered in 1884 
in Santiago to the teachers of the public schools of that city, which show an ac- 
quaintance with contemporary discussion of the subjects in question. 
In this connection special mention should be made of what appears to be a practical 
measure in aid of education in South America. On the 4th of April, 1884, the Latin- 
American Union for the Promotion and Diffusion of Useful Publications was formed 
in Santiago. The plan, originated by the government of the Argentine Republic, 
was immediately accepted by the government of Uruguay, and afterwards by Chili 
and the United States of Colombia. The object of the union is ‘to unite the efforts 
of all the Latin-American governments to encourage the publication in Spanish on 
a large scale of works of well known utility, and the diffusion of such works among 
the Spanish-speaking peoples of America.” At the meeting in Santiago, General Sar- 
miento was present as a special commissioner from the Argentine Republic, the min- 
isters of Uruguay and the United States of Colombia attended as representatives of 
their governments, and the Chilian minister of public instruction appeared for his 
government. ‘The following appropriations were made to carry out the purpose of the 
union: The Argentine Republic and Chili appropriated 105,000 francs each for 350 copies 
of all such works as should be published in conformity with the object of the union, 
the United States of Colombia appropriated 60,000 francs for 200 copies, and the Re- 
public of Uruguay 45,000 franes for 150 copies. 
It is believed that the combined efforts of the four states which subscribed to the 
union and of the others which may join it will give material aid to the develop- 
ment and progress of education.

The latest general information in regard to education in this country will be found in 
the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1881. 
The University of Antioquia sends out its third annual report at date of December, 
1883. In the preparatory school instruction is given in the Castilian tongue, orthoepy 
and orthography, rhetoric, French, English, philosophy, universal history and history 
of the country, geography, natural history, physics, elementary chemistry, arithmetic 
and book-keeping, elementary algebra, geometry, and calligraphy. In the university. 
proper there are schools of arts and trades, of mining, medicine, and law. There were 
14 pupils in the school of jurisprudence, 19 in medicine, 31 in the school of arts and 
trades, and 13 in'the school of mines,

Hawaut, constitutional monarchy: Area, 6,677 square miles; estimated population (in 1882), 66,895. 
Capital, Honolulu; estimated population, 17,000. President of the board of education, Hon. Walter 
M. Gibson. 
From the biennial report of the president of the board of education for the two years 
ending March 31, 1884, it appears that there were in the kingdom 200 schools of all 
classes, employing 325 teachers and having an enrolment of 8,723 pupils. Of the 
whole number of pupils 5,885 were Hawaiians, 1,186 half-caste Hawaiians, 288 Amer- 
icans, §58 Portuguese, and the balance of other nationalities. Nearly three-fourths 
of the children of the country were being educated in the public schools and about 
one-fourth in the private schools of the kingdom. About two-thirds of the pupils 
were receiving instruction in the English language against less than one-third taught 
in Hawaiian. Attention is called to the fact that the number of girls in the schools 
is 1,185 less than that of boys. Carefully collected statistics also show that while 
there ars in the schools under the age of 12 years 3,400 boys and 3,004 girls, over the 
age of 12 there are 1,529 boys and only 790 girls. This clearly indicates the tendency 
of girls to leave school after reaching the age of 12, a tendency att®ibuted to the in- 
difference of parents to the education of their daughters and to the intellectual apathy 
of the girls themselves. i 
Industrial education.— There is a growing interest in industrial education among 
Hawaiians and all interested in Hawaiian education. 
In September, 1883, as directed by the board, arrangements were made for the erec- 
tion of a carpenter’s shop 40 feet long and 15 feet wide at Lahainaluna Seminary, 
and it was equipped with benches and tools sufficient for the working accommoda- 
tion of 8 or 10 pupils at one time. The total expense incurred in building and equip- 
ping the shop was $230. The operations of the carpenter shop commenced in October, 
1883, and since that time up to March 31, 1884, besides many repairs and improve- 
ments which the pupils have made on the school buildings and premises, they 
have made 59 large sized blackboards and 11 school tables, all of which have been 
sold for the use of the common schools in Hawaii and Maui. The sum realized for 
these articles was $274.50. After deducting the cost of the material used and 20 per 
cent. for wear and tear of tools, the balance of the money is to be distributed among 
the pupils who made the articles. The pupils appear to take a great interest in their 
work, and the blackboards and tables show good workmanship. The operations of 
the shop are under the supervision of Mr. Hitchcock, the principal of the seminary, 
and his instruction embraces drafting and the theory and, to some extent, the prac- 
tice of house building, 
The results at Lahainaluna Seminary are highly satisfactory, and it is the purpose 
of the board soon to have many more select schools furnished with carpenter shops 
and their proper equipments. The reformatory school in Honolulu has already been 
furnished with carpenter’s benches and tools, but so far the operations of the boys 
have been confined only to works and improvements on the school premises. 
In several select day schools the girls are taught needlework, and it is proposed here- 
after to require its introduction in every select school where the services of a compe- 
tent lady teacher can be secured. 
Several of the independent schools of the kingdom have branches of industrial 
education, and, in all the independent girls’ boarding schools of the country, house- 
hold work, sewing, and cookery have a very prominent place in the course of train- 
ing. 
The president of the board of education recommends that especial provision be 
made for the establishment of an industrial or technical institute for the training of 
engineers, architects, builders, &c. 
Finances.— The assembly of 1882 voted $75,000 for the support of English and Ha- 
waiian schools, of which sum only $41,537.83 have been expended. The board has,

however, deemed it advisable to recommend that the same sum be voted by the as- 
sembly for the ensuing two years. ‘i 
Rey. C. M. Hyde, principal of the North Pacifie Missionary Institute, makes the 
following statement in a letter received at this Office: 
Ah item of educational interest is the bequest by the late Mrs. C. R. Bishop (a Ha- 
waiian chieftainess, Pancahi, daughter of Paki). The bulk of her property is devised 
to 5 trustees, who are to establish and maintain 2 schools, boarding and day. One is 
to be for boys and 1 for girls. It is optional with the trustees to charge for tuition 
or uot. The estate will probably be worth $300,000 or more. 
    New Soutu WAtxgs, British colony: Area, 309,175 square miles; estimated population, 817,468. Capi- 
tal. Sydney; estimated population (1884), 250,000. Acting minister of public instruction, Joseph P. 
Abbott. 
The following information is from the report of the acting minister for the year 
1883 : 
At the close of 1882 there were in existence 1,481 schools of various kinds ranked 
under the head of public schools and 118 denominational schools, making a total of 
1,599. Aid to dqpominational schools ceased on the 31st of December, 1882, and from 
that date the 118 denominational schools disappear from the records of the depart- 
ment. As it was foreseen that some of the denominational schools would be closed 
after the withdrawal of state aid, arrangements were made for providing by the be- 
ginning of 1883 sufficient accommodation in public schools for all children likely to 
require it. Either in new orin rented buildings, 31 additional public schools were 
opened for this purpose. These fully met all demands and little overcrowding or in- 
convenience was experienced. There were established also during the year 76 public, 
82 provisional, 12 half time, and 15 groups of house to house schools in places where 
no schools under the department formerly existed, and 12 new evening schools were 
opened; the increase of schools in the year was therefore 228, making a total in opera- 
tion during 1833 of 1,709, or 110 more than the united total of public and denomina- 
tional schools on December 31, 1882. 
The enrolment in public schonts in 1883 was 155,824. “The enrolment for the De- 
cember quarter was 132,084, and the average attendance 91,566. Of the 155,824 indi- 
vidual pupils on the books in 1883, 78,118 made the statute number of attendances and 
2,748 attended half time or evening schools. This leaves 74,958 who, for some reason, 
did not attend 70 days in each half year, 
In no year has the number of schools inspected been so great as it was in 1883. In the 
whole colony only 16 small public and provisional schools were uninspected, and these 
were omitted because in most cases they were not open when the inspectors visited 
their neighborhoods. Exclusive of evening and house to house schools, there were 
1,790 out of 1,806 schools or departments that underwent regular examination. The 
pupils present numbered 94,860. 
The 170 new schools opened in the year, where no schools formerly existed, were 
necessarily found on inspection to be in a poor state as regards efficiency, and the 
results in these schools, when averaged with the results obtained in good schools, 
reduced considerably the average of proficiency for the colony as a whole. 
‘The percentages of those who reached the required standard in the three essential 
subjects were: for reading, 75; writing, 83; arithmetic, 56. 
Buildings.— During the year 95 new and substantial buildings, to accommodate 
11,07 pupils; 44-wooden buildings, to accommodate 5,885 pupils; 72 locally erected 
small schgol buildings, to accommodate 2,091 pupils; and 29 additions or enlarge- 
ments, to accommodate 4,713 pupils —in all, 211 new buildings and 29 additions — were 
completed, to accommodate 24,496 pupils. Besides these, there were in course of erec- 
tion 87 substantial buildings for 16,112 pupils, 77 wooden buildings for 3,820 pupils, 
and 15 additions for 1,845 pupils. Many provisional schools were also begun towards 
the end of 1883, but not completed by the 31st of December. It will thus be seen that 
accommodation in new and completed buildings was provided for 24,496 pupils, and
-P-A-G-E-267
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCLXVII 
in buildings in progress for 21,857 pupils, making total accommodation in 375 new 
buildings and 44 enlargements for 46,353. The money actually paid during the year 
on these new structures was 274,9861. 9s. 11d. Repairs and: improvements were com- 
pleted or begun in 481 schools, at a cost of 12,4021. 128. 6d. 
During the year an attempt was made for the first time to give the benefits of the 
education act to isolated families. Half time schools had, up to that time, been the 
smallest recognized by the department, but in these an average of ten is needed, and 
a small building in a central position is provided. There are, however, families so 
far apart that the children cannot meet in acommon school. In these cases a teacher 
may be appointed to a group of four or five families to instruct children in their own 
homes. During the year 15 teachers were employed in this manner. 
The number of teachers employed in 1883 was 2,036, with 786 pupil teachers and 
158 work mistresses. Two training schools for teachers are reported, but are not a3 
yet well equipped for the work in hand. 
In October, 1883, high schools were opened at Sydney, Bathurst, and Goulburn. 
The attendance in these for the quarter was 119, viz, 63 boys and 56 girls, The ex- 
penditure on account of these schools for the quarter was 4,352/. 9s. 11d. 
The entire cost of public education for the year was 821,852/. 16s. 3d. Of this sum, 
354,6877. 83. 4d. were expended upon buildings, sites, and rents. From the balance, 
442,8141. 8d., should be deducted the amount of fees paid into the treasury, viz, 51,4270. 
78. 10d., leaving 391,3861. 12s. 10d. as the cost of instruction. 
New Zratanp, British colony: Area, 105,342 square miles; population, exclusive of aborigines (1884), 
540,877. Capital, Wellington; population in 1881, 20,563. Minister of education, Thomas Dick. 
The following information is from the report of the minister for 1882: 
Number of pupils on school rolls at the end of the school year, 92,476; average daily 
attendance for the year, 69,843. 
The returns show a larger in¢rease in the school attendance for 1883 than was the 
case in the two years previous. This larger attendance may be attributed not only to 
the natural increase of population, but also to the enlarged school room accommo- 
dation and to the absence of epidemics to the extent that prevailed in a number of 
localities during the years 1881 and 1882. 
The number of pupils given above includes 213 pure Maoris and 548 children of 
mixed races in attendance upon the public schools. Sixty-six native village schools 
under thecontrol of the department are also reported, with an enrolment December, 
1883, of 1,923. In addition to these, 78 Maori children were maintained wholly or in 
part at the expense of the government in 6 boarding schools connected with relig- 
ious denominations. 
Of the 92,476 pupils on the rolls of the public schools, December, 1883, there were 
presented for examination 46,439, and of these, 34,566 passed. 
The number of pupils on the rolls of the 4 normal schools or training colleges, 
December, 1883, was 149. Arrangements are made in these schools by which teachers 
already engaged in the schools may receive the benefits of special training. 
The total number of teachers, exclusive of teachers of sewing, employed during 
the last quarter of 1883 was 2,291; in addition to these, there were 122 teachers of 
sewing. 
The total income of the several education boards for 1883 was 412,7811. 11. 1d., of 
which government supplied 350,290/. 3s. 8d. and local sources 3,376I. 14s. 8d. ; the bal- 
ance was derived from education reserves, &c. The cost of the education of native 
children and those of mixed races, exclusive of those that attended the public schools, 
was 18,8271. 6s.4d. The deaf and dumb institution was attended by 32 pupils. Ten 
industrial schools or orphanages are maintained wholly or in part by the government. 
The number of children belonging to these December 31, 1883, was: Committed, 1,391; 
non-committed, 206. By an act passed in 1882 all committed children are to be de- 
tained in the schools till they attain the age of 15 years, but they continue under the

legal guardianship of the manager till the age of 21 unless previously discharged by 
warrant of the governor. This provision has proved of great advantage to those who 
need protection from their own depraved and worthless parents. 
The industrial schools act provides that the earnings of the children when at ser- 
vice shall be placed in the post office savings bank, after defraying the cost of clothing 
and other necessaries, The repayment of these moneys, with accumulated interest, is 
contingent on good conduct. The boys usually receive theirs on reaching manhood 
and showing that the money will be satisfactorily expended by them. The girls’ 
money is usually paid to them on their marriage, with the approval of the manager. 
The colony is well supplied with secondary schools, 19 of which made reports to the 
departments during the year. These had on their rolls in December 1,326 boys and 
826 girls. 
The elementary school boards have established 144 scholarships that admit their 
holders to free tuition in the Auckland College and Grammar School, the Auckland 
Girls’ High School, Nelson College, and the Otago High School. The Auckland insti- 
tutions also admit without fee those competitors who, failing to obtain scholarships, 
acquit themselves so well as to receive “certificates of proficiency” from the exami- 
ners. Such certificates are held by 15 boys and 3 girls, who availed themselves of the 
privilege. Wellington College, from funds placed at its disposal for the purpose, 
grants 4 scholarships, tenable from the age of 12 or more to the age of 16 to boys from 
the public schools. The Otago high schools also grant free education to all candi- 
dates for senior scholarships who make over'50 per cent. of the attainable marks. 
Provision for superior education is made in the University of New Zealand, Uni- 
versity of Otago, the Canterbury College, and the Auckland University College. 
Public libraries subsidy.— The sum of 6,0001., voted for public libraries, was distrib- 
uted in accordance with the resolution of the general assembly, by which the maxi- 
mum amount, of subsidy given to any institution was 501. 
Sourn Avustratt, British colony: Area, 903,690 square miles; estimated population, 293,509. Cap- 
ital, Adelaide; population (1881), 38,479. Minister of education, E. T. Smith. 
The following information is derived from the report of the minister for 1883: 
Number of public schools, 220; number of provisional schools, 211, or a total of 431 
elementary schools. Attendance, exclusive of duplicate enrolments, 41,437; average 
daily attendance, 24,683. Number of teachers employed at the close of the year, in- 
cluding temporary assistants, monitors, sewing teachers, &c., 952, of whom 384 were 
men and 568 women. Retiring allowances amounting to 1,5321, 188. 4d. were paid 
to twelve teachers. 
The number of night schools reported for the year was 65. Eachschool was open, 
on an average, 63 nights. The total number of pupils instructed was 1,219. The 
fees received from scholars amounted to 5051. 1d. and the bonus paid by the depart- 
ment to 6087. 1s. 6d. A compulsory law is in force in the colony. 
The advanced school for girls was attended by 126 pupils. The income during the 
year, including the fees for the holders of eleven bursaries (valued at 1441. 23.), was 
1,6141, 2s, 4d. and the expenditure was 1,3511. 7s. 9d. Superior education is encour- 
aged by scholarships, 6 of which are awarded to successful candidates from public 
schools. 
The total cost of public instruction during the year 1883, exclusive of the expendi- 
ture on school buildings, was 97,5371. 7s. 5d. The sum, expended on school buildings 
was 35,1651. 178. 5d.

    SCHOOL HYGIENE—INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION. CCLXIX 
SCHOOL HYGIENE, 
Last year the Bureau published and distributed a number of blank forms of inquir- 
ies as to the sites, location, construction, and arrangement of school buildings and 
the health of the scholars attending them in the various cities of the country. The 
questions were much detailed, and, although many replies have already been received, 
it is supposed that some difficulty was found in making complete returns because one 
of the blanks required a chemical examination of the air of the rooms in order to de- 
termine the degree of vitiation it had suffered from the inmates of the rooms. In 
order to explain this feature of the hygienic inspection of school buildings, which is 
comparatively new to those concerned, the Bureau is preparing a paper for the bene- 
fit of superintendents and others, containing a résumé of information on the subject. 
This paper will recite briefly the early attempts made in this country in the direction 
of school hygiene, as far as ventilation is concerned. The importance of a chemical 
examination of room air as ancillary to ventilation will then be pointed out, the 
method at present employed to make such examination, together with the standard 
or limit of impurity for school room air, will be explained, and the inadequacy of the 
unaided senses for this purpose will be shown. A table of the results obtained in ex- 
amining some school rooms in Washington, D.C., by the method previously explained, 
and the formulas employed for computing the amount of ventilation from the figures 
so obtained, will be given. 
In this connection it is a pleasure to be able to say that positive steps are being 
taken in the direction of school hygiene in different parts of the country by persons 
interested in the subject, independently, in some cases, of the initiative taken by the 
Bureau. The difficulties experienced by the Bureau in inaugurating inquiries in this 
direction are also met by the other investigators.! 
Dr. Wright prepared a set of questions calculated to ascertain the general hygienic 
conditions of the schools of the State, but the replies received were vague, showing 
that sufficient attention has not yet been paid to keeping records of the hygienic con- 
dition of the public schools to warrant the collection of statisticson the subject. This 
was also the experience of the Bureau. It appears clear, from the deficiency of rec- 
ords of sickness among school children on the part of the school authorities, as shown 
by the returns thus far, that to make a proper record of this kind and determine 
those causes of sickness, debility, &c., which may fairly be attributed to school life 
and school surroundings, a systematic medical inspection of schools should be organ- 
ized, as is the case in foreign countries. 
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT NEW ORLEANS. 
The World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans, La., is 
already foreshadowing interesting possibilities for education. Director General E. 
A. Burke, representing the management, urges that the exposition be made interna- 
tional, national, and educational. Hon. William O. Rogers, long the faithful super- 
intendent of schools in New Orleans, was sent to the late meeting of superintendents 
in this city to solicit their advice and coéperation in respect to plans for making the 
educational part of the exhibition most effective. A committee, consisting of Messrs. 
G. J. Orr, of Georgia; W. O. Rogers, of Louisiana; J. H. Smart, of Indiana; H. Clay 
Armstrong, of Alabama ; Aaron Gove, of Colorado; T. W. Bicknell, of Massachusetts; 
and B. L. Butcher, of West Virginia, was appointed, and also a committee, with 
power to act, to take into consideration an international congress of educators. The 
following gentlemen composed the latter committee: Hon. M. A. Newell, of Mary- 
land; Hon. W. T. Harris, Lu. D., of Massachusetts; William H. Payne, A. M., of Mich- 
_ igan; Hon. Le Roy D. Brown, of Ohio; and Hon. A. Coward, of South Carolina, 
  
1 This is illustrated by the experience of Dr. D. F. Wright, chairman of the committee on school 
hygiene of the Tennessee State board of health, information in regard to which comes in as this re- 
port goes through the press.

    CCLXX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The question of holding the next meeting of the department in New Orleans, in 
connection with the exhibition, was also considered, and the proposition to aid in 
the best possible exhibition of education was unanimously indorsed. 
Of the $130,000 appropriated by Congress for the exhibition of the Department of 
the Interior, $15,000 were set apart for the exhibition of education by this Bureau, and 
I have designated Lyndon A. Smith to represent this Office in the exposition and 
to supervise the educational exhibit. 
At the solicitation of Director-General Burke, enforced by the urgency of numerous 
educators, and with your approval, I have accepted from the management the respon- 
sibility of supervising the organization of the educational department of the exhibit. 
My hope is that the exhibit may be comprehensive, typical, and logical in its arrange- 
ment, but the result will depend entirely upon the codperation of those interested. 
It is very clear, first, that the general character of the exhibition cannot fail to be 
favorable to education; second, that the representation of education itself as far as 
possible to the eye may be productive of much good in advancing the knowledge of 
improved methods and principles, by bringing together the best that may be seen in 
different parts of the world. 
The opportunity which will be afforded for the meeting of educators from this and 
other countries and for their interchange of opinions is, in my judgment, one to be 
greatly prized. The exchange of the articles exhibited, the material, appliances, and 
representations of the conditions, results, and apparatus of education at the close of 
the Exposition, I hope will be specially productive (1) in adding to the important 
illustrations of the pedagogical museum of this Office, (2) in starting and stimulating 
pedagogical museums in other parts of the country, and (3) in aiding those already 
established in other parts of the world. 
RECOMMENDATIONS, 
The organization of the educational museum in connection with this Office, which 
Ihaye had the honor to recommend, now constituting a collection of great value 
and more and more visited and studied by teachers and school officers, should have 
a sufficient appropriation to enable it, by exchange and otherwise, to supply similar 
collections in the offices of the several State superintendents and the leading cities 
when desired, A new and important additional demand has been made upon the 
collection for supplying exhibits where educational collections are presented in 
State and other expositions. There can be no question of the effective aid these 
collections would render to the progress of education. Through this Office the best 
illustrations of improved appliances should be collected and distributed to all parts 
of the country. 
The reports of efforts to educate the youth of 30,000 Alaskans continually disclose 
the embarrassments arising from all absence of local administration of law. It is said 
the parents are disposed to have their children taught and the pupils learn readily, 
but it is clear there can be no satisfactory success, that the entire youth cannot be 
reached, until some form of law is provided for the organization of a school system. 
The pledges of the past and the honor of the nation would seem to permit no delay. 
An inexpensive form of civil organization has been devised and an appropriation of 
$25,000 for the education of the children, irrespective of race, has been made. This, 
in my judgment, should be increased to $50,000. 
I renew most earnestly the following recommendations: 
(1) I recommend that the office of superintendent of public instruction for each 
Territory be created, to be filled by appointment by the President, the compensation 
to be fixed and paid as in the case of other Federal appointees for the Territories. 
(2) In view of the large number of children growing up in ignorance on account of 
the impoverished condition of portions of the country, and in view of the special diffi- 
culties in the way of establishing and maintaining therein schools for universal edu- 
cation, and in consideration of the imperative need of immediate action in this regard,
-P-A-G-E-271
  RECOMMENDATIONS, COLXXY 
T recommend that the whole or a portion of the net proceeds arising from the sale of 
public lands be set aside as a special fund, the interest of said fund to be divided an- ~ 
nually pro rata among the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia, 
under such provisions in regard to amount, allotment, expenditure, and supervision 
as Congress in its wisdom may deem fit and proper. The returns of the last census 
emphasize the importance of this recommendation. The per cent. of illiteracy of per- 
sons 10 years of age and upward has decreased from 20.05 in 1870 to 17 in 1880, but 
the number of illiterates over 10 years of age has increased from 5,658,144 to 6,239,958 
in the same period. 
The delay in making some appropriate provision of national aid to education is 
constantly furnishing illustrations of the necessity and advantage of bestowing this 
aid, and is creating widely a sentiment in favor of a large temporary appropriation in 
aid of schools from the surplus in the Treasury to meet the present emergency. No 
appropriation could be made shore effectually to assure the perpetuity of our institu- 
tions. 
(3) Irecommend the enactment of a law requiring that all facts in regard to national 
aid to education and all facts in regard to education in the Territories and the District 
of Columbia necessary for the information of Congress be presented through this 
Office. 
(4) I recommend an increase of the permanent force of the Office. The experience 
of the Office indicates clearly that the collection of educational information and 
publication of the same, as required by the law regulating it, cannot be properly 
done with the present limited clerical force. 
CONCLUSION. 
I take pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to the faithful laborers in the 
Office and to all others elsewhere who have contributed to the success of its work. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
JOHN EATON, 
Commissioner.

  PREFATORY NOTE. 
The following abstracts of education in the States and Territories are derived from a great variety 
of sources, First among these come reports of State officials, such as State boards of education and 
State superintendents of instruction; next, those of county and city superintendents, school com- mittees, acting school visitors, and principals of State institutions. From these is derived nearly all 
tho information given respecting elementary and special instruction, city school systems, and normal schools, and much of that relating to secondary schools, as the high schools of the States and cities. 
‘What concerns private secondary schools is almost wholly from returns made by the principals of these to the Bureau of Education, supplemented by catalogues and other documents. 
For the matter relating to universities, colleges, and scientific and professional schools, dependence is placed on the annual catalogues of these institutions, on occasional circulars issued by them, and 
on special returns, m: de usually in the autumnal and winter months, in reply to circulars of inquiry sent them by the Bureau. In every instance, official authority only is relied upon for statements distinctly and definitely made, 
the printéd catalogues and reports being chiefly used for this purpose, though sometimes an item o interesting information from other than official sources may be given, with a reference to the quarter 
from which it is derived. In such cases, however, the effort is always made to verify the statement 
before it is committed to tho press. The matter derived from the various sources above indicated is formulated, in the abstracts of edu- 
cation for each State, substantially in accordance with the schedule given below.

ALABAMA, 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Tn 198283, with only 2,899 more children of school age, there was an increase of 
23,085 in the enrolment in public schools and of 12,489 in average attendance. To 
meet this additional attendance there were 200 more schools, with 153 more teach- 
ers, the average pay of teachers being somewhat higher than in the preceding year, 
partly from an increase of Peabody fund allowance and partly from fuller State 
reccipts of sixteenth section funds, a larger balance from preceding year, and fuller 
collection of the poll tax; the additional revenue, exclusive of Peabody fund, being 
$36,101. The funds derived from the State are said by the superintendent to have 
been in this year, as in others, supplemented by private patrons of the schools, 
though definite amounts of such additions are not available. Two additional State 
normal schools were added to the 4 previously established, and, through improved 
county institutes, fuller discussion of educational methods, and a growth of educa- 
tional interest among the people, Superintendent Armstrong thought he saw fairer 
prospects of educational advance for 1883-84 than ever previously, especially as the 
legislature had increased by $100,000 its appropriation for the public séhools, 
The figures for 1883-84 show a fulfilment of this expectation at almost every point: 
the enro!/ment in the public schools including almost the whole increase in children 
of school age, the schools for both races increasing by 394, the teachers in them 
getting better pay and holding longer school terms, while funds available for schools 
and the expenditure of these funds for the support of them went, it is believed, 
beyond those of any previous year. The only thing in which a falling off is shown 
is in the percentage of average attendance in the schools to the enrolment, g possible 
result of the lengthening of the school term, 
ADMINISTRATION, : 
  For the uniform and efficient administration of the system of public schools there 
are the following officers: (1) A superintendent of education for the State, chosen by 
the people for 2-year terms; (2) a county superintendent of education for each county, 
chosen by the State superintendent for a like term; and (3) a township superintendent 
of public schools in each township or other school district, appointed by the county 
superintendent, subject to approval of the State superintendent, also for a 2-year 
term. As to a board to examine applicants for license to teach in the public schools, 
see Preparation and Qualifications of Teachers, further on. 
The age for instruction in the public schools is 7-21. The teachers that give this 
instruction must have licenses valid for the time of their engagement; must teach 
school at least 3 scholastic months of 20 days each, annually; and must, within 5 days 
from the end of every such quarter, report to their county superintendent certain 
specified particulars of attendance, studies, time of school, &c. Separate schools for 
each race are the rule, as well as separate institutes for improvement of the teachers, 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The moneys for support of public schools come from the principal of all funds aris- 
ing from sales of public Jands or from other lands or property given by individuals 
or assigned by the State for this purpose; from estates of persons who, dying intestate, 
leave no heirs; from an annual poll tax, not to exceed $1.50, to be applied to the sup- 
port of the public schools in the counties where it is levied; from the proceeds of a 
sixteenth section trust fund granted by Congress in 1848 for the use of schools; from 
the surplus revenue fund deposited with the State by the United States under act of 
1836; trom license taxes and an optional county tax, both to be retained in the coun- 
ties where they may be raised; and from an annual State appropriation, which in 
1883~’84 was increased from $130,000 to $230,000. 
ASSISTANCE FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES. 
Aid from the Peabody educational fund was received for 1882~83 to the amount of 
$2,000 for 16 State scholars in the Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. ; $2,000 for 16 
scholarships for the year in the State Normal School at Florence ; $500 for the Normal 
Schooi for Colored Teachers, Huntsville ; $500 for a like school at Tuskegee; and 
$1,000 for the city schools of Montgomery. 
For 1883~4 the same fund again furnished $2,000 for scholarships, with $100 for 
teachers’ institutes and $2,900 for aid to the State normal schools. 
The John F. Slater fund, in the former year, gave $100 to aid in training colored 
teachers for the public schools, besides $2,000 to help a college for the colored race at 
Talladega, probably with like intent.

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER Ol EDUCATION. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
There is no general law in this State for the organization and administration of the 
schools of cities. Those in each city have been organized and are governed under 
special laws, which differ considerably in their provisions. Of the three with popula- 
tious sufficient for notice here, Mobile has a mixed city and county system, under 9 
school commissioners elected by the people and a sypeapeendent of education elected 
by the commissioners. The commissioners (3 of whom must come from the county 
and 6 from the city) are liable to achange of one-third biennially ; the superintendent 
holds for 4 years and is ex officio a member and treasurer of the board of school com- 
missioners. Montgomery puts its schools under the management of a city board of 
education of 6 members, 1 from each ward, elected annually by the city council at its 
first meeting in January, and subjects them to the supervision of a city superintend- 
ent of education, elected by the board. Selma has also a city board of education, 
of 9 members, for general management, and a city superintendent of schools appointed 
by the State superintendent,

a Another report makes the enrolment 1,730; the average attendance, 1,402. 
In Montgomery, which, prior to October, 1882, did not own a school building nor 
possess school furniture or apparatus worthy the name, a great advance in free edu- 
cation is reported. The white children of the city had been taught in one large 
building and two small ones, the latter situated in remote parts of the city and owned 
by the teachers in charge; the colored pupils,in a building leased by the American 
Missionary Association, which claimed the privilege of nominating the teachers, al- 
though they were paid by the city. The board of education, however, in 1s8zsecured 
a transfer of the lease to itself and provided additional school accommodations for 
poth races. During the year that closed October, 1883, principals of large experience 
and high attainments were secured for the schools of both races, teachers of qualifi- 
cations proven by examination were employed, and through the impulse thus given 
a new life was imparted to the schools and the attendance of both races in them was 
nearly doubled, 
In 1883~84 5 schools were reported, the same number as in 1882-83; but this must 
mean school buildings, as there were 28 teachers, each, of course, with a class, and 
probably in most cases in a separate room, which, according to ordinary reckoning, 
would make 28 schools. The teachers were 18 white and 10 colored, against 14 white 
and 10 colored the year before. The average pay of teachers for the 165 days the 
schools were taught was $170, the whites receiving considerably more than the colored. 
Selma in both years reported 1 school for white and 1 for colored pupils; but as 
there were 10 teachers in the former and 7 in the latter we must here reckon 17 
schools. The average pay of teachers for the 170 days of school is given as $133, con- 
siderably less than in Montgomery, the whites here, also, receiving much more than 
the colored. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
At the Judson Female Institute, Marion, a Kindergarten department was so 
on in 1382~83, with the usual occupations and apparatus, under 2 teachers, who had 
26 pupils in a 35-week term. Another was at Austin College, Stevenson; a third at 
the ‘Alabanis Normal School for Girls, Livingston. For any others that may be re- 
ported, see Table V of the appendix. |

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
Applicants for teacherships in public schools, unless they present diplomas from 
chartered schouls or colleges, are required to submit to an examination by the edu- 
cational board of the county in which they wish to be employed. For a third grade 
certificate, valid for a year, they must pass an examination in spelling, reading, 
penmanship, primary arithmetic, and primary geography; for a second grade, valid 
for 2 years, they must pass also in practical arithmetic, United States history, Eng- 
lish grammar, intermediate geography, and elementary algebra; for a first grade, 
valid for 3 years, they must add to all the foregoing higher algebra, natural philoso- 
phy, geometry, and the theory and practice of teaching. Those licensed must subse- 
quently attend, at least once a year, the institutes held for their improvement by the 
county educational board. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The 4 State normal schools previously existing at Florence, Huntsville, Marion, and 
aaa eee continued in 1882~’83 their work, with 2 additional ones in prospect for 
883~84. 
At the Florence School, about $400 were spent in improving the furniture and adding 
to the apparatus for instruction, while $2,000 from the Peabody fund went for scholar- 
ships. The State appropriation for the year was $7,500. Students, under 8 principal 
instructors, with numerous pupil teachers, 184, of whom 92 were normal pupils pre- 
paring to teach in the State. Graduates of the year from 3-year course, 20. 
The Lincoln Normal University, Marion, reports a new building completed in Au- 
gust, 1883, at a cost of $5,355, furnishing accommodations for 400 pupils, another 
teacher added to the faculty, and a model school established, of which members of the 
senior class took charge by turns. Nearly all the graduates had been engaged in 
teaching in the public schools and had given satisfaction, their work having been 
spoken of by superintendents in the most complimentary terms. There was a grow- 
ing demand for good teachers. The school aims to be truly professional, giving at 
first thorough instruction in the elementary branches by means of the natural method 
of instruction, and supplementing this by a training in methods of teaching. Students 
in 1882~83, 211, under 4 instructors. Of this number 4 were in the collegiate depart- 
ment, 133 in the normal, and 74 in the preparatory. Graduates of the year, 2 from the 
collegiate department and 9 from the normal. Full course, 6 years. Statistics of 
1883~’84 show 112 normal students, 8 of them graduates. 
The State Colored Normal School, Huntsville, bad also been enabled to employ an- 
other teacher for 1882-’63 through aid received from the Peabody fund. The courses 
of study embrace only those required to be taught in the public schools. Teachers 
graduated from this school find employment very readily and are said to give general 
satisfaction, The State appropriation for the year was $2,000; the number of differ- 
ent normal pupils, under 4 instructors, 195; graduates of 1883 (from the lower normal 
class), 6; years in full course of study, 4. Statistics of 1883-84 are the same. 
Tuskegee Colored Normal School, Tuskegee, also increased its teaching force in the 
Jast half of 1882-83 by aid received from the Peabody fund and from the Slater fund. 
A model school connected with the normal gives opportunity for practice in teaching. 
The studies pursued cover 4 years and include the branches taught in the State 
schools, with training in methods of instruction.!. The number of different normal 
pupils, under 4 instructors, was 126 in 1882~83 and 175 in 188384. As the school was 
opened in 1881, no regular class can be graduated till 1885, 
ADDITIONS TO THE STATE NORMALS. 
The legislature in 1883 authorized two additional normal schools to begin work for 
the State, one at Jacksonville, the other at Livingston. Both are for white teachers 
and each is to receive an annual appropriation from the State of $2,500. 
A circular of the school at Jacksonville announces that special attention will be 
given to pedagogies and didactics, as well as to thoroughness of instruction in the 
scholastic branches, academic and professional training being in large part blended. 
Calisthenics, vocal music, writing, and geometric and freehand drawing will be 
taught as part of the course, while instrumental music, French, and German will be 
optional. A primary school, attached to the normal, will serve as a preparatory” 
. school to it, and also as a model school for practice. Normal pupils, 25 in 1883-84. 
The Alabama Normal College, Livingston, is to be a branch of the Livingston Acad-   
1 The plan is said to beto have the normal students study with the others during the first three years 
and attend in the fourth to methods of instruction,

8 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
emy, a high grade school for girls, which, in return for an annual appropriation of 
$2,000 for tuition of normal pupils and $500 for school appliances, is to employ a large 
part of its teachers in training young women for State school work in 1883 and to en- 
gage additional teachers for this purpose in 1883~84 and subsequently. A late report 
tor that year gives 112 normal pupils. 
OTHER NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
Rust Normal Institute, Huntsville (Methodist), reports 151 pupils for 188384, of whom 
70 were pursuing normal studies, 17 in a higher and 53in a lower normal course, each 
course being of 3 years. The remainder of the students were engaged in primary and 
preparatory studies, which cover 2 years. 
Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, Selma, has a normal course which 
in 1882 covered 3 years, with the offer, also, of instruction in cookery, sewing, care of 
the sick, &c., for young women, and in the elements of agriculture and mechanics for 
young men. Instructors, 5 in 1882-83; students, including 50 theological, 148. 
The normal department of Talladega College, Talladega (under the auspices of the Amer- 
ican Missionary Association), has a 4-year course in studies that prepare for teaching, 
- with optional instruction in elementary agricultural and mechanical industries, in 
which there were 64 students in 1882-’83 and 57 in 1883~84. 
INSTITUTES, 
County institutes, now required by law in every county, were very generally held 
throughout the State during 1883. The superintendent says their uses and objects ai 
becoming more thoroughly understood, and that they are conducted with a ay 
more to practical improvement than to rhetorical display and literary entertainment. 
Nothing is said respecting them in the State report for 1883-’e4, i 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION.    
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Alabama makes no provision for public schools of this class, and the reports from 
cities, where alone they would be likely to exist, are too meagre in details to enable 
one to determine whether they are held. At Huntsville, in 1882~83, there appear no 
students in such higher studies as algebra and natural philosophy; at Eufaula, only 
1 in algebra, none in natural philosophy; at Birmingham, fast growing and prosper- 
ous, 40 in each study; at Montgomery, the State capital, 160 in the former and 60 in 
the latter; at Selma, 58 in the former and none in the latter. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For information concerning business eoulenee, private academic schools, and pre- 
paratory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and 1X of the appendix; and for 
summaries, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR YOUNG MEN. 
The collegiate institutions of this class are the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa 
Southern University, Greensboro’; Howard College, Marion; and Spring Hill Col 
lege, Mobile. All 4 offer preparatory and classical courses, and all but Spring Hill 
scientific; this and Howard give instruction in business; Howard, in theology; th« 
State University, in law ; and Spring Hill, in music. French and German forma pal 
of the course in all. : The University of Alabama, in common with many kindred institutions at rs   South, distributes the studies of its 4-year classical, scientific, and engineering course: 
among 10 schools, each school having its own head, whose whole attention is give: 
either to a specific study or to two or three closely related ones. Appropriate combi 
nations of these studies go to form a classical and a scientific course, which are the 
samo for the first 2 years and which lead alike to the degree of a. B.; while othe: 
combinations beyond the first year, which is the same with the foregoing two, lea 
to the degree of bachelor of engineering. Students that are unable to complete 
either of these regular courses may take an eclectic course combining the studies 
at least 3 schools, and by satisfactory completion of the subjects taught in these ma; 
have a certificate of graduation inthem. Such as get 90 per cent. or more of all the 
merit marks attainable in 3 or more of the collegiate schools, with 90 per cent. upo: 
an average in other studies, are put upon the merit roll of distinguished “7

The degree of A. M. or of civil engineer is obtained by such bachelors of arts or of 
engineering as pursue advanced studies in arts, science, or engineering under the 
direction of the professors at the university for a year after graduation and reach 90 
per cent. of the merit marks possible at the final examination. 
Southern University and Howard College have their studies also arranged in schools, 
and each has a specific master’s course for the attainment of the degree of a. M. 
Spring Hill College has the usual Roman Catholic combination of primary, grammar, 
and collegiate studies, these last covering apparently only 3 years. 
For statistics of all these, as far as given, see Table IX of the appendix; for a 
summary of such statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of this class of schools 12 are borne on the lists of this Bureau and 8 make reports 
more or less full for 1882~83 or 188384. Several, according to a common southern 
custom, arrange their studies in schools, with such grouping of the subjects of study 
in these schools as to form a fair classical curriculum, or, for those who wish it, an 
eclectic course. German and French, music, drawing, and painting are generally 
offered, and 1, Judson Female Institute, Marion, adds telegraphy. 
For statistics of these, see Table VIII of the appendix to this volume; for a sum- 
mary of their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College, Auburn, presents 2 regular courses 
of study for degrees, one in agriculture and chemistry, the other in mechanics and 
Sup ineering each requiring 4 years for completion. The board of trustees having 
decided in June, 1883, to devote attention in future almost exclusively to branches 
pertaining to agriculture and the mechanic arts, the courses of study have been re- 
modelled in order better to carry out this purpose. A special professor of agriculture 
was added to the faculty, the State agricultural experiment station was established 
at the college, and liberal appropriations were received from the State for the better 
equipment of the farm and the scientific department. The college thus appears to 
be now fully in accord with the purpose for which it was founded by Federal and 
State law: to give a liberal education to the industrial classes. 
Provision for scientific instruction is also made in Southern University, Howard 
College, and the State University, the last two presenting courses in general science 
and in engineering which cover substantially 4 years in each. 
For statistics, see Table X of appendix; for a summary of them for the State, a 
corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology, in 3-year courses of 32, 36, and 44 weeks each year, receives attention in 
the Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological Institute, Selma; the Talladega Theo- 
logical Seminary (Congregational), a department of Talladega College; and the Insti- 
tute for Training Colored Ministers, Tuscaloosa, established by the General Assembly of 
the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Howard College offers free tuition to 
theological students and gives them whatever other encouragement and assistance is 
possible, always preferring them in filling the suboffices of the college to which re- 
muneration is attached; but no special provision for theological training appears in 
its catalogues. In the Alabama Baptist Institute were 43 students for the ministry in 
1883 and 50 in 1884; at the Talladega Seminary, 14 in 1883 ; at the Tuscaloosa school, 
31 in each year. 
Legal instruction is still given in the law department of the University of Alabama, 
Tusculoosa, the course of 3 terms comprising 5 months each. The entire course, how- 
eyer, may by diligent application be completed in 10 months, or one college year. All 
students in this department are allowed to take the studies of any one of the academic 
schools of the university free of charge. Graduates are admitted to practice in the 
several courts of the State. 
The Medical College of Alabama—organized in 1859, closed during the war, and re- 
opened in 1868— provides a 2-year course of 20 weeks each, and recommends, but does 
not require, a 3-year graded course. There are no requirements for admission; for 
graduation there must have been 3 years’ study of medicine, attendance on 2 full 
courses of lectures, and a satisfactory examination before the faculty. 
Graduation at this college or at any other does not confer a right to practise medi- 
cine in the State. To secure this right, graduates must obtain certificates of qualifi-  
-P-A-G-E-282
    10 ° REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
     
   cation from the medical examining boards of the counties in which they expect to 
practise. Non-graduates must obtain a like certificate from the board of censors of the 
State medical association. Persons purposing to begin the study of medicine are ex- 
amined as to their preparation for such study by the county boards of censors, 
' 
At the Alabama institution for the above classes there are reported for the 2 y ATS 
ending September 30, 1884, 106 pupils, under 8 instructors, besides a principal, master 
of shops, matron, and assistant matron. A few other pupils had been admitted and 
had remained a short time, but were not continuedon the roll. Of the number given, 
72 were deaf and 34 blind; 58 males and 48 females. The average attendance had 
been 83. Of the whole number none had been seriously ill during the 2 years. Of 
tho teachers, 4 were for the deaf, 4 for the blind. Only whites are included in the 
sone pie State having thus far no provision for the instruction of the colored mute 
and blind.    SPECIAL INSTRUCTION.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
  There are in Alabama two organizations bearing the name of State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, one for the white teachers, the other for tlie colored, The former held a meet- 
ing at Talladega, July 5-7, 1883, with an attendance of 70 delegates, at which were 
tidy lois such topics as ‘The Heness and Sauveur methods of teaching languages,” 
y C. A. Grote, of Greensboro’; ‘The duty of parents to schools,” by Dr. H. D. 
Moore, of Prattville; ‘‘A model lesson in natural philosophy,” by Prof. 8. C. Caldw 11, 
of Rome, Ga. ; ‘Thorough education of women,” by Mrs. Craig, of Talladega ; ‘‘ Useless 
labor in the school room,” by Prof. O. D. Smith, of the State Agricultural College, and - 
“Methods of teaching the blind,” by Professor Graves, of the Alabama Institution for 
the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind; after which came the discussion of a resolution 
looking to the appointment of a committee of two from each congressionial district to 
consider and report upon such amendments to the school law as might give it greater 
force and efficiency. Whether this finally passed it is difficult to tell from the only 
report that has come to hand, | 
The meeting of teachers of colored schools was held at Montgomery, and is said by 
Superintendent Armstrong to have been well attended and to have elicited consider- 
able discussion of topics germane to the purpose of the association, but no distinct 
report of it has come to hand, beyond a general statement that the proceedings 
evinced a high degree of intelligence and a spirit of progress that was very creditable. 
Meetings of both associations were advertised for 1884, that for teachers of schools 
for whites to be held at Florence, that for the teachers of schools for colored youth 
at Tuskegee, but no report of proceedings has been received in time tor notice, 
cept of the former, which was held July 1-3, and in which were discussed in a prac- 
tical way many questions relating to methods of classification, instruction, and dis- 
cipline in the public schools, such as the time for beginving to teach spelling, and 
whether with a book or by dictation exercises; the order and number of daily class 
exercises; the question whether quiet will power or the rod should be employed in 
government; the uses and abuses of examinations in school. The decisions seem to 
have been against the old formal spelling by book and in favor of dictation; in fa 
of well settled but not too formal class exercises; in favor of calm will power rather 
than the rod, but with the acknowledgment that the latter must be used sometimes; 
while as to examinations it seems to have been held that they form a necessary test 
of thoroughness.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
From the failure of many district officers to make report to the State office, it is 
evident that school interests have not yet awakened the enthusiasm they deserve ; 
but, notwithstanding this, an increase of 304 in recognized school districts, of 365 in 
the number of these reporting, of 40,983 in enrolment of school youth, of 437 in the 
teachers employed, and of $82,274 in the expenditure for public schools reported shows 
most decided educational progress. The much enlarged percentage of youth act- 
ually in the public schools and thé fact that school property was almost doubled in 
estimated value are especially encouraging; while the number of additional teachers 
indicated may be so, and would be so if the majority of them were competent and 
were employed steadily through the school term. The small amount of normal train- 
ing in the State makes the question of general competency doubtful. As to the ques- 
tion of continuance in service, there is but scanty information. 
Superintendent Thompson thinks that the figures for youth of school age and youth

12 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 4 
enrolled in public schools do the State injustice, as the enumeration of the former, be- 
ing a condition of State aid in proportion to the number, is carefully and generally 
made, while the enrolment, bringing no such aid, is by many districts not reported. 
The per cent. of enrolment to school youth thus seems much smaller than it is, and, 
even if reported to the full, would seem comparatively small, because few from 6 to 
7 years old are sent to school and few between 17 and 21 continue in it, while pupils 
- in the State University, in the schools for the blind and for the deaf, with all in de- 
nominaiional or private schools and colleges, though included in the enumeration, 
are not counted in the enrolment as itis now reported. To remedy all this to some 
extent and to secure better reports and better school work, the superintendent urges 
(1) county superintendency, fairly paid, for visiting and stimulating schools and se- 
curing fuller reports; (2) better school directors, chosen at the general election, to 
look after individual district schools and report on them to the county superintend- 
ent; (3) the institution of county boards of education, to be composed of the existing 
county examiners and of two intelligent citizens in each county, to be associated 
with the examiner in the examination and licensing of teachers and the selection of 
text books for the county schools, for 3 or 4 year terms; (4) free text books for the 
free schools, to secure uniformity, saye much expense, and prevent the waste of time 
now general in the first few weeks of school from want of books or want of uniformity 
in them; and (5) a township system, instead of or with the district one, to consolidate 
school funds, give better school-houses, better teachers, and better appliances for 
work; among these a gradation even of the country schools. It is to be hoped that 
his recommendations may be heeded and some progressive action on them set on foot 
in the interest of efficiency and of a true school economy as well. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The system is administered by (1) a State superintendent of public instruction, 
elected by the people for 2 years; (2) a board of commissioners of the common school 
fund, of which the superintendent is secretary ; (3) a county examiner for each county, 
appointed by the county courts, and (4) district directors (3 for each district), elected 
dy the people for 3-year terms, with liability to change of one each year. Annual re- 
ports of school statistics must be made by district directors to county examiners, by 
examiners to the State superintendent, and by him to the governor. Directors fail- 
ing to make the report required are personally liable for any loss of public funds that 
may ensue from such neglect, and also liable to a considerable fine for neglect of duty. 
Teachers are required to keep a register of school statistics and to make full report 
‘of all school attendance, work, &c,, or forfeit pay for the last month taught. They 
are also required to attend the county institutes held for their improvement, and may 
not be charged for loss of time at school incurred by such attendance. In the inter- 
vals of public schools they may, with consent of their directors, teach a private school 
in the district school-house, For the educational requirements made of them, see Prep- 
aration and Qualifications of Teachers, further on. Separato schools for whites and 
blacks are required, as in other Southern States. The prescribed studies in them are 
the ordinary English ones, no provision being made for high schools, except in cities 
and towns. The books for study are selected by the State superintendent. 
FINANCES. i 
The means for the support of the State system of public schools are derived from 
the income of a State school fund, from a per capita tax of $1 on men over 21, from 
such appropriations as the legislature may set apart, and from optional district taxes, 
the last limited to 5 mills on $1 of the assessed valuation of property subject to tax- 
ation. Ifin any district the public school funds, with local taxes, should be insuf- 
ficient to sustain a school for the minimum term (3 months), district directors may 
determine that no school shall-be taught therein during such year. 
Aid from the Peabody fund to the amount of $4,050 was received for 1882~83 and 
1883-84, of which $1,600 was for graded schools and the remainder for the improve- 
ment of the teachers of the State through institutes and other normal training. 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
The State report for 1882~83 and 1883~84 gives no intimation of any new legisla- 
tive action respecting the school system, though it presents, as may be seen in what 
has been already said, an urgent call for many modifications of that system. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE: INHABITANTS. 
LITTLE ROCK. 
Administration.— The school system in the capital of the State is administered by 
@ board of school directors of 6 members, chosen for terms of 3 years, with annual 
change of 2. This board employs the teachers, manages the finances, and with the
-P-A-G-E-285
  ARKANSAS. - 13 
aid of a superintendent, chosen by itself, and of a board of 4 visitors and examiners, 
of whom the superintendent is one, determines the qualification and grade of service 
of each teacher thus employed. ‘The school year for the city is of 9 months. 
Statistics. Population of the city by United States census of 1880, 13,185; children 
of school age (6-21) in 1882~’83, 6,875; in 188384, 7,132; average attendance in the 
former year, 1,794; in the latter, 1,822; teachers employed, 36 in 1882-83 ; in 1883-84, 
37; expenditures in the former year, $50,804; in the latter, $25,327. 
Additional particulars.— Of the $30,804 of school expenditure in 1*82~83, $5,075 went 
to complete the payment for a new school building, valued, with site, furniture, é&c., 
at $25,000. The number of school buildings, including this, appears to have been 7, 
with a total valuation of $79,300, The grades were 9 below the high schools, of 
which there was 1 for each race, with courses of 4 years. 
At the close of 1882~83, Superintendent J. M. Fish, after 7 years of efficient service 
resigned his office and was succeeded by Mr. J. R. Rightsell, who had been principal 
of one of the city schools. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
To make sure that the teachers of its public schools shall be duly qualified, the 
State requires each county examiner to hold quarterly, at the county seat, after 20 
days’ previous notice to the directors of each school district, an examination of such 
persons as apply for it with a view to teaching. This examination is to be in the 
studies prescribed for the public schools. If convinced, from his test of the candidates, 
that they are competent to teach these school studies successfully and he has evidence 
that they are of good moral character, he is to give to each a certificate of a grade 
corresponding to the qualifications shown, The grades of such county certificates, 
are 3, the first valid in the county for 2 years, the second for 1 year, and the third for 6 
months. The questions for the examinations are-prepared by the State superintend- 
ent, who also has authority to examine candidates for life certificates, good through- 
out the State, which are granted when candidates pass satisfactorily, not only in the 
usual school studies, but in 10 higher branches indicated and in the theory and art 
of teaching. Without a certificate of one or other of these grades no person may re- 
ceive pay for teaching in an Arkansas public school. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
To prepare teachers for its public schools, Arkansas has, since 1872, offered instruc- 
tion at its Industrial University at Fayetteville (1) in common school studies and (2) 
in the science and art of teaching them, the course at first being of 2 to 4 years, 
then of 2 only, and subsequently of 4, all meant to be for whites only. Since 1875 like 
instruction has been offered to colored pupils in a branch normal college of the univer- 
sity, at Pine Bluff, where there has been a choice between a 2-year and 4-year course. 
As far asthe measure of students’ preparation would admit, ithas been meant that the 
courses should substantially correspond in both institutions, and the rule has been that 
an equal number of each race might receive appointments to free scholarships on pass- 
ing satisfactorily an examination in elementary English studies before their county 
judge or some one acting for him. Provision has been liberally made by the trustees 
of the university for the admission of 400 normal students to one or other of the above 
named institutions free of charge for tuition, on the certificates of county judges that 
they have passed such examination; but, for some reason unexplained, comparatively 
few appear to have availed theméelves of this provision, no distinctively normal stu- 
dents being indicated in the reports from the university for 1882~83 or 1883~84;1 at 
Pine Bluff only 40 normal students appear in these years, the greater part of all the 
students there in both years being in preparatory classes, under 6 resident instructors 
in oné year, 3 in the next. 
Through aid from the Peabody fund the State was enabled in 1882~83 to expend 
$1,200 for fuller normal training of its teachers in institutes and $1,250 for the prepa- 
ration of specially selected teachers at the Southern Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. 
The institute training, according to the rule of the Peabody trustees, was to be prac- 
tical, adapted to the needs of public school teachers, and continued for some weeks. 
The instruction at Nashville, in which 8 students from this State participated, is of a 
character fitted to prepare for a high grade of school work. - 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
A normal department at Southland College, near Helena, under a. lady principal who 
is a bachelor of science, reports 38 normal pupils for 1882~’83, of whom 1 was graduated, 
the other pupils numbering 135. A report from the same for 1883~84 shows 61 normal. 
students and 250 others, 4 of the normal pupils graduating in the year. Instruction in   
1 News has come of the suspension of the normal department at the university in the fall of 1884,

the theory and practice of teaching, as well asin the studies that prepare for it, 1s 
given, apparently to both sexes, while for girls this is supplemented by a training in 
housewifery in the dining room, kitchen, laundry, &c. The college received in 1883 an 
addition of more than $30,000 to its endowment funds, enabling it to enlarge consider- 
ably its facilities fortraining, Instructors, 5 in 1883 and 4 in 1884; normal graduates 
that had engaged in teaching, 8 according to one return, 17 according to another. - 
St. John’s College, Little Rock, shows by a circular that it continues to offer instruc- 
tion in the theory, practice, and art of teaching, which, as the last catalogue of the col- 
lege received states, covers a course of 3 weeks, 
At Russellville, as appears from the State report,a normal department was added 
in 1882 to the graded school system of the place, the person in charge of it being a 
graduate of the Northwestern Normal University of Ohio. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
For the improvement of the teachers of State common schools, the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction is required to hold a teachers’ institute annually in each 
judicial district of the State, to be called a normal district institute, Each county 
exaniiner is also, personally or by deputy, to hold a county institute, which it is the 
duty of the teachers to attend. In 1s03 the former requirement was carried out by 
holding, during the summer, in each judicial district, a 2-week institute, conducted 
by gentlemen of large experience, who had given special attention to the science and 
art of teaching. In 1804 the judicial districts were divided into subdistricts and an 
institute of ‘a week’s duration was held in each. More than 800 teachers were en- 
rolled in the former year; in the latter, not quite so many. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Arkansas School Journal, which closed its second volume in October, 1882, was 
‘succeeded in January, 1883, by Kellogg’s Eclectic Monthly and Educational sour 
Little Rock, which ended with the number for July of the same year. It was fol- 
lowed, January, 1884, by the Arkansas Teacher, published at Russellville, under the 
editorship of Principal Josiah H. Shinn, of the Russellville public schools. Of duo- 
decimo size only in the first 6 numbers, it was enlarged to quarto size in the seventh, 
and promises, if continued, to be a useful adjunct to the educational work of the State. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
Until 1881-82 the high schools for white and for colored pupilsat Little Rock formed 
almost, if not absolutely, the only schools of this class in the State. Greater educa- 
tional enthusiasm in that year led to the establishment of others at Russellville, 
Lonoke, Fort Smith, and elsewhere, while another was projected at Hot Springs. 
Reports sufficiently full to determine the character and standard of these latter ad- 
ditions are wanting. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory schools 
of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and for a summary of such 
statistics for the State, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding, 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Six universities and colleges, all open to both sexes, report for 1883-84, viz: Ar- 
kansas College, Batesville; Cane Hill College, Boonsboro’; Arkansas Industrial Uni- 
versity, Fayetteville; and St. John’s College, Philander Smith College, and Little 
Rock University, all three at Little Rock. Judson University, Judsonia, has not 
been in operation since 1882, and St. John’s College is said to have been also sus- 
ended since its last report. Its real estate had been in litigation and continued to 
de when last heard from, August, 1884, 
Little Rock University, chartered in June, 1883, had 15 collegiate students in attend- 
ance during its first year, ending at that date, Its curriculum embraces preparatory, 
classical, and scientific courses, with colleges of medicine, law, music, and modern lan- 
guages, the college of medicine being for the present represented by the medical de- 
partment of the Arkansas Industrial University. Its college building, going up in 
1883~84, was to cost $30,000, of which $15,000 were to come from citizens of Little 
Rock, 
Philander Smith College, for colored youth, hitherto reported among schools for sec- 
ondary instruction, has a collegiate department, with the usual 4-year course for the 
degree of bachelor of arts, in which 2 students were enrolled during 188384. Its 
other departments were primary, preparatory, theological, and musical. The college

edifice, Tpoently erected at a cost of $10,000 by Mrs. Philander Smith, of Oak Park, TIL, 
will accommodate about 40 boarding and 200 day pupils. Mrs. Smith also gave $1,000 
towards the erection of a building for a college industrial home, in which the young 
women are to be trained in household arts and industries, The building was nearly 
completed in January, 1884, 
The Arkansas Industrial University, as last reported, presents 8 regular courses of 
study, the classical, Latin letters, modern languages, English, scientific, civil engi- 
neering, mining engineering, and agricultural, the norma) course having been 
dropped. There are also departments in music and art, the course in the former com- 
prising usually 4 years. The property of the university (including the proceeds of 
the congressional land grant, bonds of Washington County and of the town of Fa- 
yetteville, State appropriations, and the university farm and lands) amounts in all 
to $300,000, 
The remaining colleges continue to furnish instruction as reported the preceding 
year, all presenting preparatory and classical courses, three of them, Arkansas and St. 
John’s Colleges and the State University, adding scientific, and most of them giving 
some instruction in modern languages, music, and art. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC, = 
Arkansas College, Batesville, has a ‘practical business course,” embracing 1 an- 
cient language and 1 modern, besides English, with history, geography, physiology, 
chemistry, higher arithmetic, and mathematics ; also, moral science, political econo- 
my, book-keeping, and business forms; for this it gives the degree of bachelor of 
science. Anotber course, combining classical, mathematical, and scientific studies, 
but admitting of a substitution of French or German for higher mathematics, bears a 
“gcientitic” title, but leads to the degree of a. B, 
St. John’s College, Little Rock, gives the degree of B. 8. to students that stand an 
approved written examination in the studies of its schools of English, physical science, 
and mathematics, without reference to length of course. 
The Arkansas Indusirial University, Fayetteville, more fully than either of the 
above named, presents a fair scientific training (1) in a general scientific course, (2) 
in a civil engineering course, (3) in a mining engineering, and (4) in an agricultural 
course, each well arranged and covering 4 years, The degrees given correspond with 
the courses pursued. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology.— Philander Smith College, Little Rock (Methodist Episcopal), has insti- 
tuted a theological course, meant to be prepared for by a preceding collegiate one. 
The length of this course is not definitely given, but will probably be dependent on the 
degree of preparation of the students that enter it, 
Little Rock University, of the sume church, proposes to institute such a course as 
soon as an endowment can be secured for it. 
Law.— A college of law connected with Little Rock University was organized in 1883, 
and began its instruction in October of that year, with a faculty of 11 professors and 
lecturers, besides the president. Its course is of 2 years, with a 5-month term each 
ear, 
: Medicine.— The medical department of the Arkansas Industrial University, organized 
in 1879 at Little Rock, requires for graduation the usual 3 years of study, with at- 
tendance on 2 annual lecture courses of 20 weeks each and the passage of an examina- 
tion in the subjects of study at the close, Faculty, 8 professors, a demonstrator, and 
7 lecturers. Matriculates of 1682~83, 32; of 1883384, 23; graduates in the former year, 
4; in the latter, 13, 
Gradnation at this or any other reputable medical school does not, since 1881, in- 
sure admission to medical or surgical practice in this State. To gain such admission 
there must be also the passage of an examination before a board of 3 medical exami- 
ners in the county in which the candidate wishes to practise, or, failing of success in 
this, the passage of a like examination before a State board of 5 examiners and then 
a registration in the office of the county clerk. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION, 
INSTRUCTION OF DEAF-MUTES. 
The Arkansas Deaf-Mute Institute, Little Rock, has for its object the free education 
of children in the State who are too deaf to be educated in the common schools. No 
charge is made to such for board, books, or tuition. The age for admission is 9 years; 
the ordinary limit of continuance, 7 sessions of 9 months each. The buildings are 
said to be good and the grounds ample. The common English branches are taught, 
with such industries as printing, shoemaking, and agriculture for the boys and house- 
keeping and dressmaking for the girls, The instruction given is oral for such as can

practise it; manual for the others. Instructors in 1883-’84, 5, besides a principal, 
matron, foreman of printing office, and foreman of shoe shop; pupils, 94, of whom 51 
were males and 43 females. 
At the date of the report 6 years had been completed without a death in the school. 
INSTRUCTION OF THE BLIND. 
At the Arkansas School for the Blind, Little Rock, blind of either sex receive from 
the State a training in English school studies, as well as in music and handicrafts. 
Under 6 teachers in 1882~83 there were 40 pupils. Besides ordinary school studies, 
instruction was given in mattress making, broom making, cane seating, upholstering, 
and piano tuning for the boys, and for the girls hand and machine sewing, crocheting, 
housework, &c. Valuation of grounds and buildings, $20,000, 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ARKANSAS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, 1883. 
Of the sixteenth meeting of this body, in 1883, there is only a brief record, which 
shows that it was held at Little Rock, June 27-29, and that the first important topic 
discussed was the sufficiency for schdols of the 5-mill tax, to which districts have been 
limited since 1874. The insufficiency of that tax, as an addition to the State distribu- 
table fund, was so generally agreed upon that a resolution was passed to appeal to 
the general assembly for a law that would enable districts to tax themselves more ade- 
quately for the employment of good teachers and the more efficient carrying on of 
schools, A paper by Professor Russell on ‘‘ Normal schools ” subsequently enunciated 
the idea that “finances do not make schools, that school-houses do not make them, 
but tliat as is the teacher so is the school, and that, consequently, if the State would 
have good schools, it must undertake more efficiently and explicitly the preparation 
of good teachers for State school work.” Prof. G. A. Hayes spoke of the advisability 
of setting aside a few minutes daily in the schools for brief and simple presentation 
of elementary studies in physica] sciences, with the aid of collections of natural ob- 
jects, such as seeds, plants, and geology! specimens. Professor Harney seconded the 
proposition, on the ground that studies of this kind were better fitted to develop a 
child’s mind than many others now commonly taught. Professor Conrad urged the 
development of physical strength in pupils by shortening the hours spent over books 
and giving more time to athletic exercises, as otherwise the overcultivation of the 
mental faculties would result in a fragile bodily mechanism, unfit for the rough work 
of the world. 
  STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, 1884. 
The seventeenth session of the Arkansas State Teachers’ Association was held in 
the Baptist church, Morrillton, June 18-20, 1884, with 89 enrolled members additional to 
preceding ones, and is said to have been throughout not only harmonious but even 
enthusiastic. ‘The governor of the State and the State superintendent were among 
those present. An address of welcome by Col. C. B. Henry, of Morrillton, suggested a 
movement towards such changes in the school laws as might secure the attendance of 
teachers upon institutes and make the limit of the State tax for its schools 5 mills in- 
stead of 2; but as this last was accompanied with a proposition to do away with the 
district tax, which may be of that amount, but little good could come from such a 
change. State Superintendent Thompson then suggested also some changes in the 
school law, the character of which is not stated in the only report received. These 
suggestions were subsequently referred to a committee on school legislation, and he- 
fore adjournment four members of the association were associated with the superin- 
tendent to present to the legislature the ideas of the meeting as to-changes needed in 
the school law to make it more effective. Other topics presented were the need of 
special preparation for the work of teaching ; the need of normal schools to give such 
preparation ; the development of character and physique more important than rapid 
development of mind; but so much of the time of the association was given to mu- 
sical exercises that very little real business appears to have been transacted.

    18 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
A progress steady and encouraging still appears in the figures given for this highly 
favored State. From 1881~82 to 1802~23 youth of school age increased by 6,516; in 
188384, by 12,826, an increase that was fairly brought under educational influences, 
although not quite so well proportionally as in 1882~83, as may be seen by the lower 
percentage both of youth enrolled and youth in average belonging; but average daily 
attendance showed 4.62 per cent. of increase, against 1.40 of decrease in the average 
belonging, although this average attendance was still but little more than half the 
number of school age in the former year and only 2.40 per cent, more than this in 
the latter. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For the genera) administration of public school affairs there is a State board of educa 
tion, composed of the governor, State superintendent of public instruction, and prin” 
cipal ofthe State Normal School, which makes rules and regulations forthe government 
of public schools and recommends a course of study for them. For local administra- 
tion there are county and city boards of education, each with a superintendent of 
schools and sometimes a deputy superintendent; also, boards of school trusteés, of 3 
members, for rural schoo] districts, each board having a clerk. These officers dre all 
elective: the governor, State and county superintendents, for 4 years, by the people; 
the school trustees, for 3 years, by the same, with annual change of 1; the county 
boards, except the superintendent, by the county supervisors for 2 years, withannual 
change of 2; the president of the normal school, by the trustees of the school. Women 
are eligible to school offices. 
The State schools are open to children between 6 and 21 years of age, but apportion- 
ment of school funds for them is on the basis of the number shown by census to be 5 
to 17 years of age in each district. Since 1879 schools have been graded as primary 
and grammar, no school funds going to any higher grades, except from special local 
levies. . The studies in them include, besides ordinary English branches, history of the 
United States, elements of physiology and of book-keeping, vocal music, and industrial 
drawing. Instruction in morals and manners is also to be given, though no sectarian 
doctrine may be taught. Books for the children of parents not able to furnish them 
may be supplied by the school boards, these books to be returned to the district school 
library after use. To secure to children the benefit of the elementary instruction 
thns provided by the State, all 8 to 14 years of age are required to attend the public 
schools at least two-thirds of each annual session, unless attending elsewhere or ex- 
cused for cause. The minimum session is 6 months of 20 days each, and without such 
i. session none but newly organized or suffering districts may receive State school 
‘onds. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The free schools are sustained from the income of a State school fund, which must. 
be used for paying teachers; from the proceeds of an annual poll tax of $2 on each 
voter; from county taxes, not to exceed 50 cents on $100; and from optional district 
taxes, not to be more than 70 cents on $100 for building or 30 cents on $100 for other 
school purposes. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The law for the admivistration of city school systems differs little in this State from 
that for ordinary school districts, except that in cities having graded schools beginners 
are to have the special advantage of being taught during the first 2 years by teachers 
that have bad not less than 4 years’ experience. Boards of education of at least 3 mem- 
bers are the usual rule, with partial annual change. Full poweris given them to pur- 
chase sites, furniture, and apparatus, employ teachers and oiher officers, and enforce 
a course of study and the use of prescribed text books. The special oversight of schools 
and teachers is usually deputed by each board to a superintendent, and for examina- 
tion of teachers there are associated with him 4 other residents of the city, 2 of whom 
must be experienced teachers, elected by the city board of education and holding office 
for 2 years. The certificates given by such boards of examination cover 2, 4, and 6 
years.   
dk Mongolian children and Indian children not under white guardians are ‘not included in this appor- 
jonment.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
In the cities of this State the general State rule for a gradation of the public schools 
applies with special emphasis. The prescribed grades are primary and grammar, 
where children qualified for the latter are in the schools; and county boards are re- 
quired to provide a grammar course of 4 grades, with 1 year for each grade, to pre- 
pare students for the scientific department of the State University, which course be- 
comes effective and takes the place of the ordinary grammar course if voted for by 
the qualified electors. High schools may also be established to prepare for classical 
collegiate study, but under the constitution of 1879 the entire revenue from the State 
school fund and State school tax must be used exclusively for the support of primary 
and grammar schools, as before stated. 
Los Angeles had, in 1882~’83, 1 primary school building with 28 rooms, 1 grammar 
school with 20, and 1 high with 4, besides 9 buildings with mixed grades, the whole 
12 affording 2,300 sittings and valued, with their sites and furniture, at $146,000. Its 
42 teachers had an average attendance of 43 pupils to each teacher, and the average 
annual pay of teachers, not including the superintendent, was from $750 to $1,250. 
In 1883-84 the school buildings numbered 14, the sittings 2,435, the average attend- 
ance to a teacher 45.4. A special teacher of music was employed at asalary of $1,000; 
average annual pay of teachers, $680 to $1,100; valu: tion of public school property, 
$171,500. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 611. 
Oakland in 1882-83 increased by 607 the number of its youth of school age and 
brought 350 additional pupils into its schools. Its 15 owned buildings, with sites 
and furniture, were valued at $381,175. The schools were graded as primary, gram- 
mar, and high, with 1 evening ungraded school, all apparently well supplied with 
illustrative apparatus. Music and drawing were taught by special teachers. There 
was also a teacher of French and German. A commercial class was maintained for a 
part of the year. Pupils in private schools, 1,110. 
In 188384 the inereaso of school youth was 393; the increase of enrolment, 333. 
Private and parochial schools had an estimated total attendance of 1,500 against the 
7,945 in public schools. The sittings in the public schools were 6,983, barely suffi- 
cient for the average number belonging, although 3 more school buildings were re- 
ported. In this year a well built observatory, with an Alvan Clark telescope of 8-inch 
aperture, given to the city by Mr. Anthony Chabot, was put under the control of the 
board of education to facilitate the study of astronomy in the high school, to interest 
the teachers and citizens in that study, and eventually to aid in the advancement of 
astronomical science by accurate aud systematic observations. Steps were also 
taken, under authority of the board of education, to try the experiment of introduc- 
ing elementary instruction in cookery for 2 hours a week into the grammar schools, 
resumably those for girls. An excellent course of industrial drawing appears in 
Both years, that for 1883-84 especially presenting a very complete and interesting 
course of instruction in this useful art, reaching from elementary lessons to architect- 
ural construction and to various forms of plastic work and house adornment, 
Sacramento in 1882~83, besides enrolling, out of ber 5,674 school youth, 4,130 in her 
public schools, reported 1,000 more in other schools, leaving only 544 in noschool, The   
-P-A-G-E-292
20 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  city schools were open 186 days out of 189 in the school year in 13 buildings, with 83 
rooms for both study and recitation and 2 for recitation only. Two rooms were used 
for evening schools, which had 1 male and 1 female teacher; pupils, not given. 
Special teachers of penmanship, French, and German were employed. The studies 
extended up into high school grades. 
In 18834, with 1,895 more school youth, 573 more were enrolled in public schools, 
with again about 1,000 in other schools, ‘The number of school buildings remained the 
same, but 3 more rooms appear to have been provided for the accommodation of the 
increased enrolment. An evening class in drawing is reported, with 2 teachers, but, 
as before, without note of the attendance in it. 
San Francisco in 1832~83 had greatly overcrowded schools, many classes containing 
from 65 to 75 and even 80 pupils, though the maximum number allowed by law was 54 
for grammar classes and 60 for primary. Pupils had therefore to be placed in spaces 
around the walls and on the teachers’ platforms; and even then there were many who 
could not receive even this poor accommodation. Yet, with such need of greater school 
room, the board of supervisors had cut down the appropriation for 1883—e4 to $700,000, 
against an average of $828,617 for several preceding years, although for the year to 
which this appropriation would apply there were 2,180 more children of school age 
to he provided for and fixed salaries amounting to $690,000 to be paid, with items for 
repairs, furniture, permanent improvements, and other needful things, amounting 
usually to about $90,000 more. 
‘This action, according to subsequent informatiox, compelled a partial loss of vaca- 
tion salaries in 1883-’84, but did not result, as it was feared if might, in a breaking 
up of any other general arrangement of the schools. The evening schools, whose 
courses (including commercial and drawing classes, with others for foreigners learn- 
ing English) cover 5 grades, were continued, and by March, 1884, the enrolment in 
them had exceeded 1,600, while the average attendance was over 1,200. The draw- 
ing taught included elementary, mechanical, and architectural designs. The normal 
elass of the girls’ high school came through the year without a change of even one 
member of the 58 that began the session, all graduating. This brought up the num- 
ber of such graduates to 479, of whom 130 to 135 have been employed in the public 
schools of the city and 180 in other schools, private and public, in the State. An im- 
ortant movement towards the close of the school year was the adoption by the school 
oard of a resolution to organize Kindergarten classes for all children 5 to 6 years of 
age. The overcrowding of the preceding year was in some slight degree relieved by 
the completion, in August, 1883, of a 12-class building, which had been for some time 
in progress. The schools are said to have closed the year, after ten months of success- 
ful work, in excellent condition, vigorous life having been infused into them throngh 
the aotre efforts of intelligent and effective officers, seconded by many very useful 
teachers. ' 
San José in 1882-83 had 6 school-houses, furnishing accommodations sufficient for 
all the children of school age, with the best furniture and apparatus. During the 
year the course of study was revised, the work being reduced about one-half and made 
more definite and practical. The grades established are 4 primary, 3 grammar, and 
3 high. Music and drawing are permissible parts of the course, but must be taught, 
if taught at all, by the regular teachers. 
In 18364 an additional school building appears, making 7 in all, with 52 rooms, 
An evening school, with 8 teachers, also appears in this year, for the benefit of chil- 
dren that have been compelled to leave school before the completion of the grammar 
course, as well as for others not able to attend during the day. It had 142 pupils in 
ordinary English branches and in physiology, physics, book-keeping, and industrial 
drawing. Music and drawing form part of the course in the day schools in all 
grades. Five private or church schools, with 22 rooms and as many teachers, cnroll- 
ing about 600 pupils, are reported for this year. ‘ 
Stockton classes its schools as primary, grammar, and high. The grades below the 
high, by the latest information, numbered 6, 4primary,2grammar. They were taught 
in 1882~83 in 8 buildings, valued, with lots, furniture, libraries, and apparatus, at 
$148,419. The pupils for the year were 1,766 primary, 400 grammar, and 86 high. A 
special teacher of penmanship was employed. 
In 1883-’84 the same number of buildings and essentially the same arrangements 
appear. The seating capacity of the 8 buildings is given as 2,094, the volumes in 3 
school libraries as 1,48¢, and the value of all school property as $159,595. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
In Table III of the appendix may be found a notice of at least 2 schools at San 
Francisco meant to train young people for the art and science of kindergartening. 
In Table V may be found statistics of Kindergiirten in Berkeley, Oakland, Sacramento, 
San Francisco, and San José. Ina like table in the report of the Commissioner preced- 
ing, a summary of the statistics of all such schools is presented. San Francisco alone 
reports at least 25. As before stated, Kindergarten training is to be given in 188485 
in connection with the public school system of that city to children 5 to 6 years old.

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS, 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
All applicants for employment as teachers in the public schools of this State must 
be at least 18 years old and must file with the superintendent of the county in which 
they wish to teach a valid certificate of qualification, either from the State board of 
education or from a county or city examining board. The certificat:s are for 2,4,or 
6 years, or for life, according to proven qualifications and experience. Those from 
the State board are termed diplomas. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The California State Normal School, organized at San Francisco in 1862 and re-, 
moved to San José in 1870, offers a 3-year course in English branches, including ele- 
mentgry botany and chemistry, astronomy, geology, vocal music, and methods of 
teaching and practice. ‘Those who complete this course are granted diplomas, which, 
by legislative enactment, entitle the holders to a first grade county certificate, valid 
for 4 years. For lower grade certificates, valid for 2 years, there is an element- 
ary course that covers only 2 years. A training school affords an opportunity for 
practice teaching and a preparatory class is open for students unable to meet the re- 
quirements for entering the normal tlasses, The State appropriation to it for 1883 
was $30,000. Normal students in 1882~83, 633, besides 48 in the preparatory class; 
instructors in the normal department, 14; in the preparatory and model classes, 43 
graduates of the year, 93. 
The Branch State Normal School, Los Angeles, organized in 1832, has essentially the 
same courses and arrangements as that at San José. The appropriation for it was 
$7,000 for 188283 and $15,000 for 1883~84. Students in normal classes, 180 in the for- 
nier year, 187 in the latter, under 6 instructors; in the training school, under 3 teach- 
ers, 165 in 1882~’83 and 210 in 1883~84. 
OTHER PREPARATION FOR TEACHING. 
The 1-year normal class that completes the training in the Girls’ High School of San 
Francisco was continued in 1882~83 and 1883~84; but the number to be admitted to 
the class on attaining 80 per cent. or more at graduation from the high school was 
raised in 1883 from 56 to 60, and the former rule of giving first grade certificates to 
those reaching & at the final examination and second grade ones to those reaching 
80 was resumed. To stimulate the class still further, the first vacancy in the school 
‘ department of the city was ordered to be offered to the young lady that should carry 
off the highest honors of the school. The class of 18¥3 numbered 54; that of 1834, 56. 
A normal course of 3 years appears also in connection with the high school at Stock- 
ton. 
The California Kindergarten Training School of Mrs. Kate D.S. Wiggin and the 
Pacific Kindergarten Normal School of Miss Emma Marwedel, both in San Francisco, 
3 and 1883~84 still prepared young women for Kindergarten work. For sta- 
and other information, seo Table II, Part 2, of appendix. 
ierce Christian College, College City, retained in these years its arrangements for 
instruction in the theory and practice of teaching, with special review of studies for 
examination during 4 to 6 weeks before the close of the year’s session. It reports 24 
normal students in 1883-84, 
Hesperian College, Woodland, and Pacific Methodist College, Santa Rosa, contin- 
ued also their normal training, somewhat similar to that above noted, the former at 
least till 1883, the latter at least till 1882. 
A new normal college at Auburn (the Sierra Normal College) is spoken highly of by 
a writer in The Pacific.    
     
  INSTITUTES FOR IMPROVING TEACHERS. 
Whenever the number of school districts is 20 or more in any county the school su- 
perintendent must hold at least one teachers’ institute each year, preside over it, and 
secure the attendance of lecturers competent to instruct in the art of teaching. Each 
session must be of 3t0 5 days. Teachers are required to attend and participate in the 
proceediugs on penalty of report to the county board. They do not lose pay during 
their attendance. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
Up to May 1, 1883, the Pacific School Journal, then in its seventh volume, continued 
to be the official organ of the educational department of the State government. At 
that date it was succeeded in that capacity by The California Teacher, which ended 
its useful monthly issues with the May number of 1884,

SECONDARY lyaneerdit bi 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
Since 1879 no part of the State school money apportioned on the basis of youth 5-17 
has been allowed to go towards the support of schools of this class ; but in all the cities 
such schools continue to exist, sustained from the proceeds of the city levies for school 
purposes. Their courses, as far as reported, are of 3 years. Oakland and Stockton 
show, also, business courses, apparently of a year each, and the latter literary and 
scientific courses, as well as classical, of 3 years, with optional post graduate studies. 
San Francisco, in its boys’ high school, has an English course with numerous elective 
studies, such as French, German, and Latin, and also a classical course, in which French 
and German do not appear to be included, In its girls’ high school Latin is elective, 
as itis also in the normal class beyond. 
March 4, 1884, the reyents of tle University of California adopted the plan institut- 
ed iu 1871 by the University of Michigan, and now common in the Northwest, of ad- * 
mitting to the university without examination the graduates of visited and approved 
high schools on the certificate of their principals that the course of study preliminary 
to that of the college they may wish to enter has been satisfactorily completed. The 
Oakland High School, the Boys’ High Schoo] of San Francisco, and the Berkeley High 
School were reported in May, 1884, to have been put upon the list of schools thus yvis- 
ited and approved. . 
        
      OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of universities or colleges in 1882~83, see Tables IV, VI, VII, IX, and X; for 
summaries of their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding, \ 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SRXES. 
The University of California, Berkeley, for 1883-’81, presents still 8 regular 4-year 
courses, leading to corresponding degrees, namely, classical, literary, letters and 
political science, agriculture, mechanics, mining, engineering, and chemistry. For the 
classical course, both Latin and Greek are required. The literary is designed for 
students who wish to unite Latin with a fuller course in English, French, and Ger- 
man; but Greek is not required. The course in letters and political science pays 
articular attention to the English language and literature, to modern languages, 
istory, and political science, but neither Greek nor Latin is required. For the other 
courses, see Scientific Instruction, further on. All courses are open alike to both 
sexes and are free to State students. The university is an integral part of the public 
educational system of the State and aims to complete the work begun in the public 
schools. A thorough preliminary examination is required for admission to any course 
prescribed, except (as noted under Secondary Instruction) in the case of graduates 
from high schools whose courses and methods of instruction have been examined and 
approved by a committee from the university faculty. 
The-students for the year in the colleges of sci nce and letters were 216, of whom 6 
were in graduate courses, 11 students at large, 7 in special studies, 43 in partial 
courses, and the remaining 149 in the regular collegiate classes. 
Besides the university, 11 other institutions claim collegiate rank. The College of 
St. Augustine, Benicia, pienpee reported to be thorough in its training as far as that 
training goes, comes short of the generally recognized collegiate standard, the studies 
in its first and second collegiate years being such as would be reckoned preparatory 
in a high class college. Hakentially the same may be said of Pierce Christian College, 
College City ; while the 4 Roman Catholic colleges do not readily admit of classitiea- 
tion. The others named offer substantially 4-year classical and 3 to 4 year scientific 
conrses, several having also English, literary, philosophical, or special courses. Pierce 
Christian College, Pacific Methodist College, and Hesperian College have arrange- 
ments for normal training. All the Roman Catholic colleges have commercial courses, 
as have also the University of Southern California, the University of the Pacific, and 
Pacific Methodist College. All offer instruction in music, several in drawing and 
painting, and most of them in modern languages; the University of Southern Cali- 
fornia, some training in Anglo-Saxon also. 
Washington College has not been heard from for several years, nor Pacific Metho- 
dist College since 18:2.

summary, the report of the Commissioner preceding.

INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Instruction was offered alike to both sexes in all departments of the University of 
Calilornia, Pierce Christian College, University of Southern California, University of 
the Pacific, Pacific Methodist College, and Hesperian College, when last heard from. 
Pacific Methodist had a special ladies’ course of 3 years at last accounts. Mills Semi- 
nary, Alameda County; the College of Notre Dame, San José; Santa Rosa Ladies’ 
College, and Harmon Seminary, Berkeley, are especially for the higher training of 
young women. For any others of this class reported, see Table VIII of the appendix; 
ora summary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of California continued in 1882~83 and 1883~84 its scientific conrses, 
each of 4 years, in agriculture, mechanics, mining, civil engineering, and chemistry, 
all leading to the degree of B. 8, All but the first of them continued to present op- 
tional graduate courses beyond, for the degrees of mechanical engineer, mining or 
metallurgical engineer, civil engineer, and master of science or doctor of phiioso- 
phy. To aid in the studies which prepare for these degrees, every facility is extended 
to candidates for them that can be found in the libraries, laboratories, and collections 
of the university, which are steadily growing in extent and usefulness. The general 
library has already over 22,000 volumes, with author and subject catalogues for ref- 
erence; the museums contain all the great collections of ihe various State surveys, 
with others from private donors; while the laboratories bave been planned after care- 
fal study of the best in America and Europe, and are largely increasing their facilities 
for work. The statistics of attendance have been already given under Superior In- 
struction. The course in letters and political science appears to have been consider- 
ably broadened, the latter subject receiving much fuller attention than in previous 
years. Like the other courses, it is of 4 years. There is also a higher course in the 
same line, leading to the degree of PH. D. 
Nine of the denominational colleges in the State offer also scientific courses of 2 to 
4 years each. For the statistics of attendance on these, see Table 1X of the appendix 
to this volume. For statistics of the school of Practical, Civil, Mining, and Mechani- 
eal Engineering, Surveying, and Drawing in San Francisco, see Table X, Part 2. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological instruction in 3-year courses, meant to follow a collegiate course, was 
continued in the Pacific Theological Seminary, Oakland (Congregational), and in the 
San Francisco Theological Seminary, San Francisco (Presbyterian). For students 
that present no testimonials of collegiate or other high training, there is a prelimi- 
nary examination in both these seminaries. Students at the former, 6 in 1882~’83, 
under & professors and lecturers; in 1883~’84, 8, under 11 professors and lecturers. 
Graduates of 1883, 1; of 1884,3. The latter seminary, up to 1883, had had a total of 44 
students from its beginning in 1871, and in 1883 added 3 to the 3 remaining from 1882, 
all under 3 professors. Graduates of 1883, 2; of 1884,1. Both seminaries have good 
libraries; that at San Francisco was newly arranged and classified in 1803. 
St. Thomas’ Theological Seminary for the Province of San Francisco (Roman Cath- 
lic) was opened in 1883 at the mission of San José, Alameda County, with 2 pro- 
fessors ; number of students in 1883~84, 22. 
Less systematic training for ministerial work was offered, under “ Christian” influ- 
ences, at Pierce Christian College, College City, and at Hesperian College, Wood- 
Jand, the instruction being mainly in biblical literature and geography, eastern 
manners and customs, moral philosophy, evidences of christianity, &c. At the Uni- 
versity of Southern California, Los Angeles, collegiate students looking to the minis- 
try were offered instruction in Hebrew and in historical and systematic theology under 
Methodist influences, 
Legal instruction was continued at the Hastings College of Law, San Francisco 
(the law school of the University of California), in a full 3-year course, of 32 weeks 
each year. Students for admission must give satisfactory evidence of general educa- 
tion and culture; for admission to the middle or senior year, must pass other exami- 
nations, and then a final examination for adegree. A moot court has been established 
for the discussion of legal questions by members of all the classes. Students of 
1883~84, 131, under 2 professors, besides the president of the university and dean. 
Medical training of the ‘‘regular” type was prosecuted in 1883 and 1884 at the 
Toland College of Medicine (of the University of California) and at the Cooper Medi- 
eal College, both in San Francisco. Both had 3-year graded courses; the former, of 
22 weeks each year till 1884, then of 36 weeks; the latter, of 20 weeks for both years, 
with examinations at the close of the first and second years for promotion and at the 
close of the third for graduation. Cooper had also an examination for admission and

24 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONUR OF EDUCATION. 
‘Toland announced that it would require one at the opening of the session of 1885 from 
uncertificated candidates. Toland had 13 professors; Cooper, 11, with 4 assistants. 
The graduates of the former in 1883 were 11; those of the latter, 19. Both schools 
admit women. 
The California Medical College, Oakland (eclectic), with 10 professors, had 32 
matricnlates in 1883, and graduated 11 from its substantially 3-year regular course of 
24 weeks each year. 
It is stated in the United States Medical Investigator that a new homeopathic 
8 opened in San Francisco June 5, 1884. 
ivy was taught, as before, at the College of Dentistry of the University of 
ornia, by a faculty of 6 professors, with 5 demonstrators and 13 clinical in- 
structors, in a course that covered 2 terms of 9 months each. For entrance on this 
course there must be evidence of a fair preparation, in a certificate from some repu- 
table school or college or the passage of a preliminary examination in elementary 
Eng pu, physics, and mathematics. Graduates of 1883, 7; matriculates of that 
a 82.     
         
  BY 
Pharmacy had still its representative school in the College of Pharmacy of the State 
university, with 4 professors and 65 students in 1883, of whom 13 graduated; course, 
2 years, of 23 weeks each, with evidence of 4 years’ pharmaceutical practice. In 1884 
there was instituted a preliminary examination of all uncertificated candidates for 
admission, 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The California State Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Berkeley, 
had of these two classes 136 pupils during 1882~83, of whom 79 were boys and 57 girls. 
Common school studies occupied 5 hours daily in the school days, both the manual 
and the oral system of communication being used for the deaf. The training in in- 
dustries included cabinet making, cane seating, mattress making, and shoemaking. 
The instructors were 9 (4 male and 5 female) for the deaf-mutes; 3 for the blind, wit 
2tforemen of shops. Admissions of 27 mutes and 12 blind brought the whole number 
of pupils for 1882~83 and 1&83~’84 up to 175, of whom 283 were graduated or discharged, 
leaving 152 on the rolls June 30, 1824. 
EDUCATION OF CHINESE YOUTH. 
At least 28 auxiliary associations, with nearly 600 members (some not reporting this 
item), appear to have worked zealously for the intellectual, social, moral, and re- 
ligious improvement of the Chinese in this State, in connection with. the Women’s 
Foreign Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church of the Pacific Coast. This 
society has a home for Chinese women in San Francisco, to which, in the ten years of 
its existence up to the close of 1852~83, there had been 129 women and girls admitted, 
who were taught religion and good morals, the arts of housekeeping, the exercise of 
sympathy and kindness in care of the sick, the need of cleanliness and order, and the 
primary branches of school studies. A school for Chinese boys, with 20 to 30 in at- 
tendance, was also sustained. Each of the auxiliary associations did what could be 
done in the same direction, maintaining 8 night schools and about as many Sunday 
schools. 
‘The above is only a specimen of what is done in this way, the Protestant Episcopal, 
United Presbyterian, Reformed, Baptist, Congregationalist, and Methodist Episcopal 
Churches all working moro or less, and the Congregationalists contributing through’ 
their Amevican Missionary Asssociation, which for 1883 reports 187 schools for Chinese, 
wi 2, n average membership of 958, and an average attendance for the 
school te 
      
       
EDUCATION OF CHILDREN IN ORPHANS’ HOMES. 
Information as to this may be found in Table XXII, Part 1, of the appendix, at least 
22 appearing there for 1883, while for 1884 reports come in too slowly and too late for 
fair presentation except in the report for 188485. All (or nearly all) these institu- 
tions combine some industrial and educational training with their care for the bodily 
wants of the children in their hones, 
TRAINING IN ART. 
Some note of this at Oakland may be-found in a preceding reference to what has 
been done there in 1882-’83 and 1883-84 in connection with the public schools. San 
Francisco, in its evening schools, has a drawing department in which systematic in- 
struction is carried through 3 grades, elementary, mechanical, and architectural, this 
Jest includjag construction of mouldings, the five orders of architecture, plans and 
elevations from existing buildings, stair building, coloring, and BE AGINE: Of special

in drawing from the flat, the round, the living model, from landscapes, and from 
other natural objects; the Society of Decorative Art, which indicates its object by its 
title; and the Art School of San Francisco, open to both sexes, which, besides drawing, 
painting, &c., has a class in etching, 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Industrial School of the City and County of San Francisco reports for 188384 a 
total enrolment of 331 inmates, with 18 officers and other employés. Of the inmates, 
147 came over from those in school the preceding year, 149 new ones were received, 13 
that had been out on leave had that leave revoked, 17 were surrendered by parents 
and gu ns for further training, and 5 that had escaped were captured and re- 
, making the total above given. Of this number, 121 were granted indefinite 
° of absence in 1883-84, 37 were discharged, 10 escaped, and 2 died, leaving 161 
remaining July 1, 1884; average number through the year, 150. A great majority of 
the committals for the year were white boys and girls, only 2 Chinese and 2 blacks 
coming in. In the school department, where there was an average belonging of 80 
boys and an average daily attendance of 70, there is instruction in spelling, reading, 
writing, geography, arithmetic, and history. A milder discipline, with almost entire 
disuse of the rod, was adopted, with happy results of better order and increased prog- 
yess in study. The productive industries engaged in were shoemaking, tailoring, 
ordinary sewing, and laundry and garden work, with farming. Expenditure for the 
year, $39,909. 
         
  EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION, 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association held its seventeenth annual session at San Fran- 
cisco December 26-28, 1883, President William White in the chair. The sabject of 
the president’s annual address was ‘‘ Popular objections to the public schools.” He 
met these briefly, and closed by saying that where any ground existed for an objec- 
tion the fault lay usually with the teacher and not with the system. A lively discus- 
sion followed upon the resolution that ‘the principles of industrial training, includ- 
ing the elements of trades, should be taught in the public schools.” Those who took 
the negative side of the question thought that the little knowledge pupils would gain 
by the use of tools would not be commensurate with the cost it wouldinvolve. Those 
in the affirmative said the cost could be met by a little self denial, that too many 
hours were required for.mental work, and that physical labor should be intermixed 
with studies for the sake of variety, health, and final usefulness. A paper on ‘Edu- 
cation and crime” was read, showing by figures that the population of the prisons in 
the United States and European countries represent largely the illiteracy of the coun- 
tries, and that but a small percentage of the liberally educated are found among the 
convicts. The nextresolution was that more attention be given in the public schools 
to morals and manners, by giving the subject a place on the daily program, with 
suitable text beoks thereon. After discussion a vote was taken, and the affirmative 
sustained. Mr. C. M. Drake read a paper advocating more extensive playgrounds, 
and said school boards would spend thousands of dollars for school-houses and make 
no provision for playgrounds beyond fencing in a back yard and perhaps putting a 
shed over it. = 
A proposition offered to abolish the stady of grammar as a science in the public 
schools was followed by an address on ‘‘The text book question,” i. e., the question 
whether the State should purchase text books and supply the schools with them free 
of cost to pupils, or should print the books from manuscripts and plates and supply 
the schoo]s at cost, or should leave the matter as it at present is, which last seems to. 
have been preferred. A resolution to abolish corporal punishment was presented 
ad discussed: no substantial argument was advanced for the negative; and for the 
ifirmative Hon. A. L. Mann, ex-superintendent of public schools, said that corporal 
vunishment was barbarous and unnecessary, that its infliction begets nervousness 
and ill temper, and that he did not think the conscience of a child could be reached 
by the application of the rod. Addresses followed on ‘‘ The sphere of the public high 
school;” ‘‘Why do we educate, and to what extent shall the State educate?” ‘The 
teachers’ interest in the State university ;” ‘Spelling reform;” “ Kindergarten train-    
   
   
   
      
      
      ing. The following resolutions were adopted: (1) To lessen the subjects for dis- 
cussion and limit the time of disputants; (2) to discourage the use of liquor and 
tcob ; and (3) that, in the opinion of the association, the publication of text books 
by the State is inexpedient and impracticable, and will, if attempted, result in great 
pecuniary loss to the State and expensive, unsatisfactory books for the schools; after 
which the association adjourned.

OBITUARY RECORD. 
REV. CYRUS TAGGART MILLS, D. D. | 
This gentleman, said to have done more for education in California than any other 
of its citizens, was born in Paris, N. Y.; graduated at Williams College, Massachu- 
setts; studied for the ministry at Union Theological Seminary, New York City, and 
in October, 1848, went as a missionary of the American Board of Commissioners for 
Foreign Missions to Ceylon, where for five years he was principal of the Batticotta 
Seminary, having studied Tamul in advance to prepare himself for teaching work in 
Southern India. A remarkable success is said to have attended his instructions, but 
the enervating climate broke him down in his seventh year of residence, and com- 
pelled a retnrn to his native Jand for recuperation, which came only after four years’ 
seeking. Then, forbidden to return to India, he went, under the same auspices as 
before, to the presidency of Oahu College, near Honolulu, the Sandwich Islands 
seminary for education of the children of missionanes and foreign residents. Re- 
maining there fonr years, he did excellent educational work, and so greatly improved 
the finances of the college as to set it on a fairly self supporting basis, which has con- 
tinned ever since. But again the enervation of a tropical climate proved too much 
for him, and in 1265, at the invitation of Miss Atkins (afterwards Mrs. Mary Atkins 
Lynch), he went to California, purchased the Benicia Seminary, which had been Miss 
Atkins’s school, and for seven years did good work there for the education of young 
ladies in a high school and collegiate course; then removed the school to a charming 
site in Alameda County; secured grounds containing 85 acres; planted these grounds 
with abundance of shade trees, and by 1871 had an excellent and spacious new build- 
ing for the school in the midst of these now beantiful surroundings. He meant the 
title of it to be “Alderwood,” but architects and friends insisted on the title of ‘ Mills 
Seminary,” in honor of his thorough renovation of it. He eventually deeded the 
seminary to the State as a permauent institution of high order for the educational 
and Christian training of the sex for whom it was designed, and it now stands as the 
monument of himself and his devoted wife, its property and buildings valued at nearly 
$300,000, with scholarships of $20,000 for the benefit of gifted young women without 
the necessary means for thorough study, all, or nearly all, secured hy him and Mrs, 
Mills. His Seat: calm and peaceful, thongh preceded by ‘much pain, came April 20, 
1884, at his beloved seminary, as the result of disease contracted in his iaboriGn mis- 
sionary years.

  28 REPORT OF TIE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
As far as can be determined from the preceding figures, the educational status of 
the State shows a slight decline. School districts were, indeed, more numerous by 
52, school-honses by 66, the sittings in these by 5,228, with larger expenditure for sup- 
port of schools to meet a considerable inérease in youth of school age, while enough 
teachers were employed with fairer wages on the part of men. Still there was nob 
only a fulling off in the percentage of enrolment to school youth, but also more consid- 
erable decreases in the per cent. of average attendance to enrolment and to youth of 
school age. 
The reports from county superintendents show, however, that in most cases and in 
many things there has been a fair average of good school work; that teachers have 
on the whole been as well prepared and useful as could be expected in a region where 
normal training is yet in its infancy; that directors of school districts, although 
often inexperienced, have considerably increased the school accommodations and 
have shown a willingness to do this still more another year; that in some schools the 
Jatest methods and text books were in use; that one county, in which are a large per 
cent. of Mexican school children, has succeeded in awakening among the parents of 
these an interest in the education of their youth; that another, emerging from the chaos 
of a floating population, has adopted a uniform system of text books, still another 
proposing to do the same; while one county has held a teachers’ institute, a rare 
thing because of the wide spaces to be traversed, with small means and few facilities. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For the management of public school affairs there are the following officers: (1) a 
State superintendent of public instruction, to supervise and make report of the whole 
school system; (2) a State board of education, of which he is president, to make rules 
and regulations for the due conduct of public schools and to issue State diplomas to 
teachers of proven scholarship and culture; (3) a superintendent of public schools in 
each county, to examine teachers for the county, visit and supervise the schools in it, 
report their statistics and condition to the State superintendent annually, and appor- 
tion school moneys to the district boards; (4) boards of directors of school districts, 
those of first class districts to be of 6 members and those of the second and third class 
of 3 members, in each case with annual change of one-third. These officers are all 
elected by the people of the State, county, or district which they represent, and, ex- 
cept in the district boards, serve for 2-year terms; in those boards, for 1, 2, and 
3 year terms at first, but after the third year all for 3-year terms. Women are eligible 
to these district boards and may vote at elections for them. 
The schools of the State system are free to all persons 6 to 21 years old shown by 
an annual census to be residents in the districts where they are in operation. 
No one may be debarred from attendance on them or be subjected to special clas- 
sification because of race or color. Schools must be kept in session at least sixty days 
each year on pain of forfeiture of State school funds. The studies to be pursued in 
each and the text books to be used are determined by the several district beards. 
Sectarian instruction in them is forbidden, but a fair training in good morals is pro- 
vided for by the requirement that the teachers for them shall be of good and even of 
unexceptionable moral character. Gradation of studies is provided for up to those of 
high schools, which are connected with the State university. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
    
  The means for support of public schools come from the proceeds of a State school 
fund, of a county school tax of 2 to 5 mills on the dollar, of optional district taxes, 
and of the receipts from fines, penalties, and forfeitures, these last going to the dis- 
tricts or counties in which they have been incurred. The State and county funds 
thus raised are distributed to the several school districts according to the children of 
school age shown by the annual census. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Amendments to the school law which took effect May 27, 1883, made once a quarter 
the minimum of requirement as to a county superintendent’s visitation of the schools, 
instead of the whole requirement; allowed him to revoke certificates of any grade for 
immorality, incompetency, or other just cause; forbade the granting of teachers’ cer- 
tificates by him without a thorough and satisfactory examination of the candidates 
for them ; required him to retain for 6 months the written answers of these candidates, 
subject to the order of the State board of education; called for an account, on or be-

SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
In this State school districts with more than 1,000 children of school age are doe- 
nominated districts of the first class and elect at the outset 2 directors for 3 years, 2 
for 2 years, and 2 for 1 year, annually thereafter 2 for 3 years, making a yearly change 
of one-third, These first class school directors, at tho first meeting after their elec- 
tion, choose a president from their own number; a secretary, who may be of it; and 
a treasurer from outside the board, each for a year’s service or until his successor 
is clected and has qualified. The treasurer is required to give bond in double the 
amount of money liable to come into his hands. The others take oath to perform 
their duties faithfully. Each board is given power to make necessary by-laws for its 
own government and the government of the public schools, Each of the 2 boards of 
this class has a superintendent for its schools.

Denver reported 14 school buildings for 1882~83, all finely constructed, well venti- 
lated and furnished. These afforded ample room for all children of school age. The 
Whittier school building, erected in the year 1883, contains 12 rooms for study and 1 
for recitation only. ‘The general 4-year course of the high school includes Greek and 
Roman history, Latin or German, French, drawing, and music. The classical course 
also covers 4 years and includes Greek and Latin, with French as an optional study. 
‘This classical course, like the scientific department of the general course, is intended 
to fit students for the State University and for college. Below the high school are 
8 grades, making the full school course 12 years. After the third grade German is 
optional, the supervision of instruction in it being committed to a German teacher, 
with 2 assistants. Regular teachers of proven competency may give instruction in it 
and receive extra compensation. 
Leadville school property in 1882~83 consisted of 4 buildings, valued at $155,100, 
accommodating 22 schools, which contained 2,300 sittings for study. The city school 
system provides for 2 primary, 4 intermediate, 3 grammar, and 4 high school grades. 
The school year consists of 3 terms, aggregating 9 months. The course of study in 
the high school includes the higher English branches, with astronomy, botany, French 
history, and German or Latin. Private and church schools had about 100 pupils. 
In 1883~84 the valuation of school property remained the same and enrolment and 
average attendance fell off, the latter considerably ; while the estimated number in 
private and church schools was more than doubled, although expenditure for public 
schools and accommodations in them had increased by $25,418. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
No district board may employ any person to teach in any of the public schools 
of this State unless such person have a license to teach, issued by the proper dis- 
trict, county, or State authority and in full force at the date of employment. Such 
licenses have been granted since May 27, 1833, by boards of districts with more thau  
-P-A-G-E-302
  30 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
1,000 school children to teachers that have been examined by the boards with a view 
to filling vacancies; during the coutinuance of the teacher in the district where the 
examination was made these supersede the requirement of a county superintendent’s 
license. In all other cases there must be a certificate from the superintendent of 
schools in the county where the applicant desires to teach or a diploma from the State 
board of education, the former being good for 6 months, a year, or 2 years, the latter 
during the lifetime oz good behavior of the holder. Both are to be based on open 
and full examination. 
     
NORMAL COURSES. 
Normal instruction was given in 1882~’83 at the University of Colorado in a 3-year 
course, which appears to have been since lengthened to 4 years, aud even 5. Appli- 
eants for admission must declare their intention to become teachers and pass a satis- 
factory examination in common school studies. The English branches are taught, in- 
cluding anatomy and physiology, botany, chemistry, and zodlogy. The course is now 
apparently a very thorough one, going into the theory and practice, as well as the 
history, of education, mental science, school economy, and the philosophy of educa- 
tion, geveral and special. 
Colorado College, Colorado Springs, when last heard from, in 1883, offered 4 years 
of training in common school, higi school, and collegiate studies, with the addition 
of the history and philosophy of education, principles and methods of instruction, 
Beno} organization and government, and school law for such students as intend to 
teach, 
The University of Denver offered in 1882~83 and 1883~84 a special course of 1 year 
for those wishing to fit themselves for teaching in the public schools. This course 
embraced methods in arithmetic, in grammar, in geography, and in history, with school 
management, art of teaching, and oral methods. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
There is a law for holding one of these temporary normal schools in any county 
when reasonable assurance of the attendance of 25 teachers shall be given by the 
county superintendent to the State superintendent, such institutes to continue in 
session for not less than 2 weeks of 5 days each and to be aided by $100 annually, in 
each case, from the State treasury; but, from the great size of counties, the small 
number of teachers in most of them, and the lack of facilities for transportation and 
accommodation, comparatively few have been held. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Schools of this class are provided for as parts of the State system and are found in 
the cities of Denver, Golden, and Leadville, Denver having 3 courses of 4 years each, 
general, classical, and scientific; Golden, one of 3 years; and Leadville, a 4-year course 
in English studies and another in Latin. Pueblo High School graduated 9 pupils in 
1884, they being the first graduates from the public schools of that city. An impos- 
ing and thoroughly convenient high school building was erected during the year. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
    For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, 
and preparatory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and 
IX of the appendix following, and the summaries thereof in the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN AND FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Colorado, Boulder (non-sectarian), is governed by a board of 6 
regents elected by the people, with an annual change of 2. It is a part of the pub- 
lic school system and is free to State students of either sex. The institution presents 
full 3-year preparatory courses, leading to collegiate, classical, scientific, and 
Latin-scientific courses of 4 years each; also, a 2-year normal course. Special stu- 
dents, not candidates for graduation, may be admitted by vote of the faculty. A 
school of medicine has been established since the last report. The statistics of the 
years 1882~83 and 1%$3~’84 show a total attendance in that time of 145, of whom 13 
were in collegiate studies, 100 in preparatory, 31 in normal, besides whom appear 17 
special and 2 medical students, showing that several must have been counted twice, 
The average attendance is given as 69 in 1482~s3 and 86 in 188304, x i 
Colorado College, Colorado Springs (Congregational), in the latest bulletin of studies 
received from it, presented preparatory, collegiate, and normal courses, each of 4

presentation of certificates of graduation from secondary schools, which would enable 
then: to enter colleges in the neighborhood of their places of residence in the Missis- 
sippi Valley or at the East. AJlits courses are open to both sexes. Statistics for late 
years are wanting. 
The University of Denver, Denver (Methodist Episcopal), presents a schedule of pre- 
paratory, classical, collegiate, scientific, and mining engineering courses of 4 years 
each, with spe ourses in music, fine arts, business, normal, and medical studies. 
Like the State University and Colorado College it admits both sexes, and goes so far 
in its Jiberality in this respect as to accept for instruction pupils in the first eight years 
of instruction, calling this department of its work (which is designated by the title of 
Colorado Seminary) ‘junior preparatory.” At the close of the school year 1883-84 
collegiate students numbered 76, 57 being in preparatory courses, all under 13 in- 
structors, 
A college under Presbyterian influences, with outlying normal or preparatory 
schools, is said to be projected at Denver.— (Presbyterian Age.) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University. of Colorado, considerably modifying its arrangements, presents 
courses in scientific lines,including mathematics, physics, chemistry, zodlogy, geol- 
ogy, botany, philosophy, and political economy, with others in engineering, descrip- 
tive geometry, topographical drawing, and surveying, reserving the right to withdraw 
these last unless there be at least 5 applicants for any one; Colorado College, six 
courses, in chemistry, geology, surveying, assaying, mineralogy, and physics; the 
University of Denver, a well-arranged 4-year course in essentially the same lines as 
the above, leading to the degree of bachelor of science, but with only 3 scientific col- 
legiate students in 184384. The StateSchool of Mines, Golden, which requires for ad- 
mission an examination in the higher English branches of study, offers three regular 
courses in civil engineering, mining engineering, and metallurgy, each covering 4 
years. Special courses are also offered in assaying, chemical analysis, geology, min- 
eralogy, and surveying. Lectures and lessons in drawing were given to a class of 
young ladies. Students in regular courses, 1882~83, 37; in special courses, 57; at- 
tending lectures and drawing classes, 33. In 1883-84, according to a correspondent 
of the Journal of Education, there were only 46. The Colorado Agricultural College, 
Fort Collins, open alike to both sexes, has a preparatory course of 1 year leading to 
studies in scientific agriculture, horticulture, botany, chemistry, geology, and zoélogy. 
A2-year labor course prepares for practical mechanics, including the use of tools, in 
wood and foundry work, iron and steel forging, with the elementary principles of the 
various trades. In 1882-83 it reported 1 post graduate student, 39 collegiate, 10 
special, and 31 preparatory, under 6 profegsors and an instructor in horticulture; in 
1883-84, 36 collegiate, 16 special, and 25 preparatory, under 8 professors and an in- 
structor in music. 
For full statistics of these schools, see Tables IX and X of the appendix to this vol- 
ume. For asummary of such statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL.- 
Theological.—No regularly organized theological seminaries are known to this 
Bureau as existing in the State in 188384, but the framework of such a seminary 
appears in the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral, Denver, where the bishop and 3 assist- 
ants constitute a theological faculty for the training of such students for the ministry 
as may present themselves. In the Roman Catholic year book for 1884 there is men- 
tion of 5 ecclesiastical students, but without indication of the place in which they 
were or of the teachers by whom they were instructed. 
Medical iustruction is given in the University of Denver in a 3-year course, with 3 
courses of lectures, of 24 weeks each. Candidates for admission must pass an exam- 
ination in English studies and the rudiments of Latin or present a certificate of pro- 
ficiency in these branches. Medical students are admitted to any of the regular 
classes of the university free. Professors and other instructors, 16 in 18@2~83, 18 in 
1883~-4. Students in the former year, 21; in the latter, 22. 
At the University of Colorado a medical department appears in 1883-84, with 7 
professors and a course of 3 years of 34 weeks each, to be admitted to which the ap- 
plicant must present evidence of literary qualifications, in a collegiate degree, a 
Bigh schocl diploma, or the passage of a satisfactory written examination. The 3- 
year course, though recommended, is not obligatory if evidence of full qualification 
for a degree shonld be presented at the end of any collegiate year, A hospital for 
¢linical instruction is provided, Some security for full instruction is found in the fact

that a candidate for a license to practise medicine must pass an examination before 
a State board of medical examiners. 
Pharmaceutical instruction —The medical faculty of the State University offer to 
such as desire to practise pharmacy a 2-year course of training. It isnot said whether 
there were any students init in 1883-84, 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAI-MUTES AND OF THE BLIND. 
The Colorado Mute and Blind Institute, Colorado Springs, is sustained by the State, 
and combines common school studies with industrial training in carpentry, printing, 
dressmaking, plain sewing, and general housework. There were 43 deaf-mutes in 
the school in 1883~34, under 4 teachers, but no report of any blind pupils was received 
during the year. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The State Industrial School, Golden, which had 80 inmates by report of Novem- 
ber 1, 1882, received, up to a like date in 1884, 116 additional, making 196 since its first 
opening. Of these, 123 had been apprenticed or discharged, leaving 73 under a super- 
intendent, matron, and 11 assistant officers, the number having been reduced as much 
as possible, owing to insufficient appropriations ; this threatened a temporary break- 
up of the school, but the calamity was averted by prompt aid from Governor Grant to 
the amount ef $20,000 on his personal responsibility. The school has now about 20 
acres of Jand, with four new brick buildings, begun March, 1883, and finished in the 
August following, while several frame buildings have also been erected and others 
improved. Lducation and industries go hand in hand as in other kindred institu- 
tions. The property of the school is estimated at $44,505; its ordinary expenses for 
we years, at $44,468; extraordinary, for new buildings, land, furniture, and stock, 
at $29,465.   
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
COLORADO STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The ninth annual session of this body was held at Greeley, December 26-28, 1883, 
President Hale reminding the members that 20 years before this meeting the place 
where they were assembled had been a camping ground for Indian fighters, of whom he 
had been one, while now they found a prosperous city, with fine churches, good society, 
a noble school building, and a most comfortable and inviting place for their assem- 
bling. Reviewing the work done in the State, he said he had seen the first school 
held in Colorado in a log school-house ; had seen villages change to cities, and the old- 
time schools, in huts, abandoned billiard halls, and warehouses, give place to costly 
edifices with full corps of teachers, in less than a quarter of a century. Now he 
wanted further progress in checking the evil tendencies of a fast life, reviving a 
sense of the dignity of labor, corresting our imbittered political contentions, and 
fostering correct opinions on educational, social, and civil questions. Miss Hattie BE. 
Hayes, of Alamosa, then gave a talk on ‘‘ Map sketching ;” Miss Whiting, of Denver, 
on ‘Friday afternoons,” now utilized in many schools for special exercises ; Miss 
Sarah Graham, of Denver, on “The teaching of English ;” Miss Fannie Manly, of 
Georgetown, on ‘‘ The teacher as a member of society ;” Miss Crabtree, of Grecley, 
completing the ladies’ list with what is said to have been an excellent class exercise 
illustrative of the tonic sol fa method of teaching music. 
The gentlemen then taking the floor, Mr. Evens Thomas, principal of the 
normal department of the State University, showed ‘‘To what extent the citizen 
should be educated by the State,” (1) in broad general culture, (2) in the line of spe- 
cial education; F. E. Smith, of Greeley, discussed methods of teaching German and 
French, analyzing different systems and giving the preference to Grimm’s law of the 
mutation of consonants; E-x-Superintendent Cornell argued in favor of ‘‘ National 
ald to popular education ;” President C. L, Ingersoll, of the State Agricultural College, 
traced the origin and growth of the existing sentiment in favor of industrial training, 
and showed what was to be hoped for from it in the future. The spirit of the meeting 
is said to have been excellent throughout.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
In 1882~’83 there appearssome retrogression in place of the preceding educational ad- 
vanee, for, with 3,278 more children of school age, 748 fewer were brought into the 
ublic schools and the attendance in all schools was 1.20 per centum:less than in 
881~82. Still, average attendance in the public schools was better and absolute 
385

  34 ‘REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. | 
attendance in all schools larger, while several great improvements were made (1) in 
the erection of a new building for the State normal school, (2) of one for the normal 
school of the city of New Haven, and (3) in beginning: the rebuilding of the burned 
high school at the State capital, on broader foundations, with diminished height, 
and with such fire prooting as will be likely to secure it against future conflagration, 
these 3 buildings being aan in construction and arrangement. Besides these, 
22 new school-houses were completed during the year, at a total cost of $153,282. For 
new buildings, $327,408.32 were expended, and for repairs and alterations of existing 
ones, $85,062.22. In 14 towns 26 evening schools were opened for such pupils as could 
not attend during the day, an‘! in 56 towns 853 cases of non-attendance at school were 
investigated, in 375 of which the children were found to be unlawfully absent from 
school. All this indicates a vigorous administration of school affairs in at least the 
better class of towns, as well as at the State office. 
In 1883~84 the increase of children of schoolage was only about half that of 1882~83, 
yet enrolment in public schools and average attendance in such schools considerably 
advanced, while other than public schools lost 280 from their previously reported 
pupils, the number in no school also diminishing. All this, with an increase of 5 
in public schools, of 44 in the departments of such schools, of 18 in the number of 
raded schools, and of $973,355 in estimated value of school property, shows a very 
tee general condition for a year marked by great general depression in business. 
The only drawback of any consequence is an increase of $338,132 in district school 
indebtedness, a thing resulting partly from the general financial trouble and partly 
from the simultaneous building of several large school-houses, which last will proba- 
bly be a blessing in the end. fs 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For general oversight of the State free schools there is a board of education of 6 
members, 2 ex officio as chief State officers and 4 chosen by the general assembly, one 
in each year, for 4-year terms. This board employs a secretary of its own appoint- 
ment, delegates to him most of its visitorial and supervisory powers, and gives him 
the assistance of a clerk for office duties, as well as of an agent to secure observance 
of the laws for some schooling of all children, January 1, 1883, Mr. Charles D. Hine 
succeeded Hon. Birdsey G. Northrop as secretary. 
For local supervision and management of the schools there are boards of sckool vis- 
itors, of 3, 6, or 9 members, in every town (township); boards of education, of 6 or 9, 
in certain school districts that represent former schvol societies; and school commit- 
tees, of 3 members, in each of the ordinary school districts into which most towns have 
been divided. These bodies are all elective at the first annual school meetings of 
their towns or districts; are subject afterwards to change of one-third at the succes- 
sive school meetings; and, in the case of the first mentioned, must appoint at least 
one member acting scbool visitor (in case of the second, may do so) each year, to make 
sure a visitation of the schools twice or more each year, in company with the district 
school committees. 
Still further to secure an educated population, the State requires that schools shall 
be maintained at least 36 weeks yearly in every school district that has 110 or more 
children of school age, at least 30 weeks in districts that have 24 or more such chil- 
dren, and at least 24 weeks in other districts. Only districts that have had less than8 
pupils in average attendance are excused from keeping up a school, and then the 
school visitors of the town must make arrangements for the attendance of the children 
at some neighboring school. 
Having made these arrangements for the education of its children, the State, since 
1882, insists that they shall be availed of by at least all from 8 to 14 years of age during 
12 weeks each year (6 of these weeks to be consecutive), on penalty of $5 for each 
week of failure to attend. To give further emphasis to this requirement, manufact- 
urers and others are forbidden to employ children under 14 years of age without a 
certificate from a teacher or school officer that the prescribed minimum of schooling 
has been had. The school visitors of every town and the special agent of the State 
board of education are charged with the duty of seeing that these laws are obeyed 
or that the penalty of violation of them is imposed on those in fault. 
High schools, « normal school, and town libraries enter into the State system. 
An instance of what may be done to improve schools in small towns and districts 
is presented at Stafford Springs, Tolland County, where the census of 1880 shows only 
2,031 inhabitants. Here, in place of 5 former ungraded schools, a system of 4 schools 
has been organized in one building, centrally located, with a primary department 
of 2 years, an intermediate of 3 years, a grammar department of 3, and a high school 
of 4 years. The whole is under the direction of one person, who acts as superintend- 
ent and principal. By bringing all these departments into a central building he and. 
his assistant teachers are enabled to follow a definite course, with pupils enough in 
each class to work profitably; whereas, before, each of the 5 ungraded schools had the 
same ground to cover, with a proportionately small number of pupils, and each 
teacher had also a proportionately larger number of classes. The change is said to
-P-A-G-E-307

have been brought about with remarkable smoothness, and after nearly a year’s trial 
is pronounced an assured success, meeting admirably the wants of a small town and fur- 
nishing better and more systematic teaching at probably about the same cost, ifnot less, 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The State comptroller each February apportions to such towns as have kept their 
schools open the time above required $1.50 for every child 4 to 16 years of age shown 
by the preceding January census. This money is raised by a State tax of 1} mill on 
$L. Besides this, the income from a State school fund, from town deposit funds, from 
school society funds, and such amounts from each town treasury as may be agrecd 
upon at the annual town meeting go to the support of public schools; but the first 
and last ean only go to districts that have school-houses and outbuildings satisfactory 
to the school visitors and that have made to these visitors the required reports. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Among the new Jaws relating to schools in 1884 was one giving the State board of 
education power to examine publicly, in such branches and on such terms as it may 
prescribe, persons desiring certificates of qualification to teach in any public school 
in the State, to grant such certificates to those whom it may find qualified, and to 
revoke them in case of need. The acceptance of these certificates in lieu of the ex~ 
aminations previously prescribed by law is, however, optional with school visitors 
and boards of education. 4 
Another act gave boards of school visitors power to include training in manual arts 
among other matters of instruction in the public schools. 
A third relates to a refusal of parents or guardians to report to the enumerators 
the names and ages of their children of school age, as well as information as to the 
school attendance of such children, and imposes a fine of $3 for such refusal. 
Others allow towns to authorize their school visitors to employ teachers to give 
instruction in the rudiments and principles of vocal and instrumental music in their 
several schools, and to pay the salaries.of such teachers}; released the secretaries of 
such boards of visitors from the necessity of being members of the board and accom- 
panying the members in their visitation of the schools; required school districts 
with 10U or more school children to maintain schools at least 36 weeks each year, and 
those with 24 or more such children to maintain school 30 weeks at least, and those 
with fewer children at least 24 weeks. 
SYSTEMS OF TOWNS AND CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS, 
OFFICERS. 
For places with the above population that embrace whole towns, there are boards 
of visitors; for others that were formerly school society districts, not coextensive 
with the towns in which they are situated, there are boards of education; for 
towns that have abolished their school districts, school committees, in each case of 
3 members or some multiple of 3, with an acting school visitor, principal, or superin- 
tendent of schools. As far as can be ascertained from the State report, Middletown 
and New Haven appear to be the only cities. Even Hartford, the State capital, has 
a town system.

  ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Bridgeport, in 1882~83, with 192 more children to be taught, increased by 201 the 
registration in its public day schools, by 549 the average membership in these, by 551 
the average daily attendance, and had 424 pupils perfect in attendance, an increase 
of 87. It also registered 90 pupils in an evening drawing school, with much better 
results than from a larger number the year before; completed and furnished a high 
school building, sail to be a model of its kind, with accommodations for 650 pupils; 
and employed enough additional teachers to meet the increase of school children —all 
with less expenditure than in the preceding year. Besides the pupils in public schools 
there were 566 in private schools, leaving yet 1,737 children in no school. 
In 1283-84, with 404 more children, it enrolled 114 additional, had 242 additional 
in average atiendance, and expended for its public schools $21,234 more. An evening 
drawing school was conducted in the high school building with great success, 
Danbury increased its school children by 124, its public registration by 59, and its 
average attendance by 40, with less expenditure than in 1881-82. In private schools 
there were 101; in no school, 643. In 1883~84 there was a further gain at all points, 
with larger expenditure. 
Derby gave special attention to training in ready and proper use of language, using 
stories and pictures in the lower grades to suggest ideas and lead to right expression 
of them, while in higher grades came letter writing, bills, receipts, orders, abstracts 
of lessons, &c., the result being that even scholars 10 years old learned to write short 
letters and papers said to be almost faultless in form, punctuation, spelling, and capi- 
talization. In 1384 there were gains at all points. 
Greenwich had 35 more children to provide for than in 1881~82; enrolled 77 fewer$ 
slightly increased the average attendance; rebuilt and removed an old and poor school 
building, placing it nearer to most of the children for whom if was designed, and ex- 
pended in this and other improvements $8,979 more than in the previous year. Chil- 
dren in its private schools, 210; in no school, 336. There was no especially notable 
change in 1 4. . 
Hartford, although it had 156 more children of school age, enrolled in public schools 
377 fewer, and had in average attendance apparently only 16 more, but, through a re- 
building of its burned high school and the erection of another schocl-house, it ex- 
ceeded by $107,905 the expenditure of 188182. A new rule was adopted as regards en- 
trance to the high school, viz, that the first three-fourths of the first class of each district 
school should be admitted without examination. Of course, opinions differed as to the 
expediency of such a change, and, as a somewhat kindred rule in Philadelphia has not 
worked well, it may not prove successful here. But the board of school visitors was 
unanimously in favor of the change, and it will be thoroughly tried. The evening 
schools noticed in 1882 were continued, and by their good work in supplying the edu- 
cational deficiencies of many that attend no other schools are said to offer each year 
new reasons for further continuance. Of the school children of the town 1,265 were 
reported in no school in 1883 and 1,675 in private or church schools. 
The next year, 188384, with fair gains in enrolment, average attendance, and 
teachers employed, there were 2,442 in no school and 2,015 in other than city schools, 
The new high school building was sufficiently completed for partial occupancy Jan- 
uary 8, 184, less than two years from the burning of the former one. Total cost, 
$28,000. i

Meriden increased its school population by 135, and, though the registration in its 
schools was lower by 81, had 209 more children in average attendance. For the mainte- 
nance of schools $2, more were expended, yet 915 of its children were out of school 
and 505 in other than public schools. The second year of the town high school         
      
   
            even more satisfactory than the first, and the third year opened in the fall of 1883—e4 with an attendance that so overtaxed the building as to require the erection of a now 
one, for which the town appropriated $50,000. - The first class for graduation, June, 
1883, numbered 13. ‘The course of study adopted in 188182 for all the schools was 
proving very satisfactory. 
Afiddle‘own city schoo! district by itself did not do so well in some respects as the town 
with which its statistics are connected in the*table, enrolling in 1882~83 only 914 dif- 
ferent pupils out of 1,505 of age for schooling, while the town enrolled 1,130 out of a 
considerably smaller number, and having also 617 in private or church schools against 
only #5 irom the town in schools of that class, both being nearly alike as to children 
in no school. The per cent. of attendance for some part of the year was thus 94.4 in 
the town and only 57.5 in the city; but in holding scholars once enrolled the city 
schools showed their superiority, they having 81.9 per cent. of those registered attend- 
ing, against 75.8 on the part of the town schools. In 188384 this seems to have been 
reversed, the city schools having only 68.3 against 90.8 per cent. in the town, expend- 
iture for the schools of both decreasing. 
New Britain, having 1,228 of its children in private or church schools and 646 in no 
school, had only 51.9 per cent. of its school youth in public schools, though, as in 
Middletown city district, good teaching had its results, the per cent. of attendance 
upon registration being 81.7, and this per cent. would probably have been still higher 
had not epidemics prevailed during the winter term. Its high school is well spoken of. 
New Haven city erected 3 new school buildings and greatly increased the accommo- 
dations in another, at a cost for lots, buildings, and equipments of nearly $90,000, 
These honses made the number owned by the city 29, besides 5 rented for school use 
and 2 orphan asylums in which schools were held, making 36. The school rooms oc- 
cupied were 217, an increase of 14; the seats provided, 10,875, an increase of 693. Four 
evening schools were held again 5 months, with 14 teachers, 761 enrolled pupils, and 
283 in ave e attendance. Superintendent S. T. Dutton, who succeeded Mr. Ariel 
Parish in 1882, appears to have done excellent work. Improvement of the teaching, 
by efforts’ to secure broad conceptions of the aim of school training and thorough 
adaptation of means to ends in all departments of instruction, has been his first aim. 
As an aid to this, a normal class for young teachers was organized in September, 1882, 
and meetings were held after school hours every Wednesday afternoon till April 1, 
1883, to study principles of education and the more recent methods of teaching. The 
attendance\at these mectings gradually increased till in place of only small classes 
from the training schools there were from 150 to 200 teachers of all grades studying 
the history and philosophy of education, new methods of teaching geography, and 
exercises in breathing and vocal training. Other meetings, by which teachers of a 
certain grade in a given section of the city were brought together for an afternoon in 
some class room where the waohing was exceptionally good, enabled these visitors to 
study for an hour the methods used. After dismission of the pupils, opportunity was 
given to ask questions and exchange views as to special work. Courses of lectures 
from eminent educators in the high school hall during the autumn aided the improve- 
ment aimed at by these means, by bringing together teachers and citizens to consider 
the science of good teaching. The only other noteworthy changes in 1882~83 were 
the abolition of the annual examination as a basis of promotion in primary and gram- 
mar schools, a step toward abolition of the special class in the high school, a partial 
introduction of ‘newspaper geography,” and a broadening of the work of training 
teachers by adding another year of instruction (in a new school building, with better 
aids to work) for graduates of the high school and others of acknowledged merit. 
In 1883~84 New Haven considerably increased its school accommodations, housed 
its training school in a new and excellent building, introduced some elements of Kin- 
dergarten methods, improved in several ways the modes of teaching, and carried into 
effect the abolition of the special class in the high school, proposed in the preceding 
year. Elementary manual training was tried in 2 schools with such success as to en- 
courage the extension of it; 6 evening schools were held, mostly for 76 nights, under 
11 teachers, with 519 pupils and an average attendance of 209; while the general day 
schools had an increase of 654 in enrolment and of 506 in average attendance over the - 
preceding year. 3 
Norwalk in 1883 made all its schools substantially free to all the children of school 
age in the town, even if the attendance should be outside of the district in which the 
children might reside. It also gave its schools uniform text books. 
Norwich central district revised its course of study, improved its teaching of num- 
bers, drawing, and music, and introduced physical exercises as a part of the regular 
school program, with good results. Its West Chelsea district determined in 1883~84 
to introduce drawing into its schools.

| PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
No teacher may be employed in any school receiving any part of its support from 
public money until he has received a certificate signed by a majority of the board of 
school visitors or by all the committee appointed by them; nor is any teacher entitled 
to wages paid out of any public money appropriated to schools until he can produce 
such a certificate of a date previous to the opening of his school. The minimum of 
requirements for such certificate are good moral character, with ability to teach 
reading, writing, arithmetic, and grammar thoroughly, the rudiments of geography 
and history, and of drawing if required by the board. State certificates have already 
been noticed, 
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Connecticut State Normal School, New Britain, organized in 1850 to train 
teachers for the public schools, changed both its head and its home in 1883, Pro- 
fessor I. N. Carleton, who had been principal since 1869, having resigned June 22, 
and Mr. C. F. Carroll, of Oil City, Pa., having succeeded him in July; while for the 
school an excellent new building was so far advanced that the fall term of 1883-84 
began in it in September, though it was not completed until January. In this build- 
ing—which is of stone and brick, and, with grounds, grading, and furnishing, has 
cost the town and State $113,000 — there will be greatly improved facilities for healthy 
and effective normal work. ‘The full course continues to be 2 years, of 39 weeks each. 
Applicants for admission must present certificates of good character from the school 
visitors of the towns in which they live, must be at least sixteen years old, must in- 
tend to teach in the Connecticut public schools, and (unless graduates of high schools 
approved by the board of education) must pass a satisfactory examination in com- 
mon school studies.! Of students entered on these conditions, there were 107 for the 
fall term, which began in September, 1883, and ended January 18, 1884, Of other 
pupils (apparently in the model school, which represented three grades of school 
work) there were 55. A Kindergarten, for illustration of Frébel’s methods, was to 
be added to the model school in 1884, 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
New Haven, as mentioned under a preceding heading, added another year in 
1882~83 to the 1-year course before prescribed for such as aim to teach in the city 
schools; prepared in this way to draw in from the high schools candidates of higher 
grade; gave its enlarged school the advantages of a new building, with more room 
and greater teaching force; and also did very much towards improving those already 
teaching, by showing them the way to higher grades of work. Bridgeport and Hart- 
ford are believed to have continued the training before given to advanced pupils in 
their high schools for the purpose of preparing them for city school work. 
MEETINGS OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOL OFFICERS. 
Uodktla law that has been several times slightly altered, the State Board of ediica- 
tion is required to promote efficiency in teaching by holding at various convenient 
places meetings of teachers and school officers for the purpose of instructing them in 
the best modes of administering, governing, and teaching public schools. During 
1882~83 such meetings were held in 9 towns by 33 different instructors, including the 
principal of the normal school and several of the most eminent teachers in the State. 
To a few towns in which teachers’ meetings were a part of the town system, in- 
structors were also sent to give these meetings an additional stimulus by means of 
instruction upon special topics. 
The teachers of Windham and New London Counties organized in May, 1883, an 
association for mutual improvement, and those of Hartford and Fairfield Counties 
held their usual meetings. Rebeeet ere 
° 1 Examinations for admission to the normal school are now held annually at different points through-   
ut the State,

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Of these schools, which are rather permitted than encouraged in this State, there 
were 24 reported in 1$62~83, Hartforl County having 9} New Haven County, 5, 
Fairfield and Middlesex, each 4; New London and Windham, 1 each. These num- 
bers evidently do not include schoolsin which only some higher branches are taught, 
as a report 2 years before, which doubtless took such in, made the whole number then 
in operation 51, instead of 24. Bridgeport entered into possession of a new and com- 
modious high school building for the session of 1es2~-3, Hartford completed for use 
in January, 1884, its high school, rebuilt on broader foundations than the one it lost 
by fire in 1882, and now, it is believed, made fire proof. Meriden sent ont, June 15, 
1883, the first class graduated from its high school, which, instituted in 1881, would 
thus seem to have a course of only 2 years. At the annual town meeting, in 1834, 
$50,000 were appropriated for a new high school building, to meet a greatly enlarged 
attendance which had overtasked the capacity of the former building. 
In 183-84 the New Britain high school, one of the feeders of the State Normal 
School, reported a general and a classical course, each of 4 years. That of Hartford 
adopted in April the rule of but one session daily from 9 A. M. to 1.35 P.M. The rule 
of 1832~83 as to admission, noted under city schools, is said to work well. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For the statistics of business colleges, private academies,! and preparatory schools 
reporting, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for summarics of these statis- 
tics for the State, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
  SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
Trinity College, Hartford (Protestant Episcopal), Wesleyan University, Middle- 
town (Methodist Episcopal), and Yale College, New Haven (non-sectarian), contin- 
ued in 1882~83 and 1833-84 their regular 4-year collegiate terms of instruction, all 
with high standards for admission and graduation and with well arranged courses, 
classical and scientific. These courses show from year to year a somewhat wider 
range of studies as well as improving arrangen ents for instruction. 
Trinity changed its president in 1883, Rev. T. R. Pynchon, D. D., LL. D., retiring 
after nine years of service and being succeeded by Rev. George Williamson Smith, 
D. D.; Dr. Pynchon still fills the chair of moral philosophy. Some other changes in 
the faculty were made, the results being two additional professorships, of physics and 
of metaphysics, with some broadening of the courses of instruction. Preparations for 
a wider range of elective studies were set on foot and a well equipped observatory 
was added to the means for scientific training. Faculty, 14 in 188283; 16 in 
188384 ; students, 66 in each year. 
| Wesleyan retained its 3 regular courses of undergraduate study, classical, Latin-sci- 
entific, and scientific, for the degrecs of A. B., PH. B., and B. S., with special honors 
for special proficiency in any one. All studies in the freshinan year of each course 
are required ; after that elective studies are introduced and increase in number with 
each year of advance, Special courses are also continued for such as are not candi- 
dates for degrees, as well as for graduates who desire to continue studies beyond the 
collegiate course. The admission of female students remained a feature of the col- 
lege system, and 18such appear in the catalogue of 1883~84, out of 201 in all, of whom 
15 were special students aud 1 a post graduate. Faculty for that year, 18. No pro- 
fessional studies had yet been introduced to justify the title of university. 
Yale, retaining still its modest collegiate name, showed in 1882~’83 and 1883-’84 a 
fair university organization in departments of theology, medicine, law, philosophy, and 
the arts, this last including the undergraduate academical (or collegiate) department, 
the Sheffield Scientific School, and a school of the fine arts, all ofiering facilities for 
graduate instruction, with or without reference to the acquisition of degrees. The 
undergraduate academical, of 4 years, with required regular studies throughout, 
calls for 4 exercises a week in optional additions during the last 2 years, these exer- 
cises embracing philology, Philosphy; history and political science, mathematics and ° 
astronomy, molecular and terrestrial physics, natural sciences, and the fine arts, 
all leading to the degree of A. B. The graduate instruction beyond this includes in- 
tellectual philosophy, political science and history, philological science and litera-   
10ne school of this class—the Loomis Institute, Windsor, Hartford County — is not yet on the Bureau 
list, because it does not appear to have been yet opened for instruction, though chartered and possessed of a considerable endowment, $380,000 having been left in trust for it by two brothers, James C. and 
Hezekiah B. Loomis, ‘to found an institate for gratuitous education,” according to a letter from a 
surviving brother. This family is said to have also done much towards bringing up the school system 
of Bridgeport to its present high position,

gree of M. A. or of PH. D. after 2 years of successful study. Lor those that seek them 
there are also degrees of civil and dynamic engineering attainable by bachelors of 
philosophy who have taken the first degree in engineering and then pursue satisfac- 
torily Dives course for 2 years. In this whole department of philosophy and the

names counted twice ; total in all departments, counting no name twice, 1,096 in the

      INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN.   
It has been before mentioned that Wesleyan University admits women to its privi- 
Jeges, and had 18 in 1s#3~84, Yale admits them to its school of the fine arts, aud had 
33 in 1882~’83, with 43 the next year. Tor other institutions that admit women to 
what is claimed to be substantially collegiate training, see Table VIII of the appen- 
dix; fora summary of their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. | 
  SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, New Haven, presented in 1882-’23 and 
1883-84, as p: y, its 3-year courses of instruction in mathematical, physical, 
and natural sciences, hav.ng in the former year 207 students, under 28 professors 
and instructors, and in the latter 213, under the same number. On September 21, 
1883, it lost by death the excellent senior of its faculty, Prof. William A. Norton, a 
teacher of more than {fifty years’ experience, who since 1852 had taught civil engi- 
neering in Yale College and this school. No special change appears to have been 
made in the genera! outline of instruction in the two years mentioned beyond what 
comes naturally from increasing thoroughness on the part of teachers chosen for their 
high qualifications and furnished yearly with considerable additions to their mes 
of teaching. The number of students advances from year to year, and the prep 
tion of candidates for admission is said also to show marked improvement. Besides 
the regular student courses, there es of lectures to mechanics and 
others on interesting and instruct: ij Teaching in military science 
is given, according to law, by office: Jnited States Engineering School at 
Willet’s Point. 
The Storrs Agricultural School, at Mansfield, established in 1881 for the education of 
Connecticut boys in such branches of science as may conduce to skill in agricultural 
pursuits, presents for 1882 2-year courses in general and agricultural chemistry, farm 
mechanics, land surveying, botany, zodlogy, animal physiology, practical and theo- 
retical agriculture, dc. Professors and instructors, 3 in 1883; students, 30; graduates 
of the year, 6. 
Courses leading to the degree of B. s. are offered at Trinity College, Hartford, and 
at Wesleyan University, Middletown, which last has also one leading to the degree of 
PH. B. ‘       
       
           
  PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology in 8-year courses, meant to follow a collegiate course, was taught during 
1882~83 and 18e3~84, after the Congregationalist form, at the seminary of the Theo- 
logical Institute of Connecticut, Hartford, and at the theological department of Yale 
College, New Haven; after the Protestant Episcopal form, at the Berkeley Divinity 
School, Middletown. Students at the first named in these two years, 46 and 54, under 
6 professors and 4 lecturers, with an instructor in music and voice building; at the 
second, 106 and 99, under 6 professors and as many lecturers, with an instructor in 
elocution ; at the third, 39 in the first year, under? professors, including one of elocu- 
tion. Advanced or graduate classes appear at Yale in both years; at Hartford there 
was one in the latter year. 
Law was taught in the department of law of Yale College, in the 2-year course for 
undergraduates, by the regular faculty of 7, with 3 special lecturers in 1882/83 and 
5 in 1883-84. In the graduate course it was continued by 5 special lecturers and in- 
structors to 2 candidates for the degree of M.L. in 1882~83 and to 6 in 1883~84, with 
1 candidate for the degree of D.C. L., all these candidates being bachelors of law of 
other colleges and one a master of law. 
Medicine, in the 3-year graded courge of the medical department at Yale, was ex- 
pounded by the regular teaching faculty of 7 in the years 188283 and 188384, each 
year covering 34 weeks, 10 lecturers and other teachers aiding in the instruction in 
the former year and 8 in the latter. In this latter year there was 1 graduate student 
in advanced studies and also 1 special student, besides the 29 regular students in the 
3-year course. The number in the preceding year, all regular, was 30.

its students with at least a fair outline of what relates to the history, theory, and 
practice of art. The full course in these subjects covers 3 years and is open to young 
women as well as to young men; no student under 15 years of age may be ad- 
mitted. Of 40 uncollegiate students in 1882~83, 33 were women; of 49 such in 
1883-84, 43 were women. Students from the Shefiield Scientific School, additional to 
these, 82 in the former, 84 in the latter year, Students from Yale College proper, for 
whom there is an optional art course from January 1 to June 1 each year, not given, 
Teaching professors, 3, with 3 other instructors and a librarian, there being a consid- 
erable library of art, as well as collections of paintings, statues, casts, &c. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Hartford Hospital and the Connecticut Training School for Nurses, of the New 
Haven Hospital, continued in 1833 their valuable work of p: ing women of fall 
age, sound health, and good character for intelligent and efficient nursing service. 
The course in the former is said, in the latest circular of the directors, to be of 2 years; 
that in the latter, the committee give as of 1 year, with 6 months of additional prac- 
tice under the direction of the school. The number in the former school in 1883 is 
not given in the circular sent. In the latter there were, at the close of that year, 23 
at the hospital and 11 in private families. During the year 15 had graduated, making 
73 from the beginning ten years before, A new dormitory for the nurses, planned in 
1882, was in use in 1883. 
      
    
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES. 
The report of the American Asylum for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Hartford, 
shows for 1882~’83 a total attendance of 210 and an average for the year of 185. In 
1884 there was 1 more in attendance. The method of instruction continued to be that 
known as the eclectic or combined system, in which all the pupils have their general 
education carried on through the medium of signs, writing, and the manual alphabet, 
while those that show aptness in acquiring articulation and lip reading are taught 
these as special branches. 
The Whipple Home School for the Deaf, Mystic River, continued also its instruction 
under the articulation and lip reading system, in which lines it claims eminently suc- 
cessful results. 
EDUCATION OF THE I'REBLE-MINDED, 
The Connecticut School for Imbeciles, Lakeville, reports for 1883 a total attendance 
of 102, of whom 92 remained at the close of the year. The number of beneficiaries 
of the State during the year was 60, of whom 56 continued on the list at the close, 
The system pursued is first to improve the sluggish physical system by active exer- 
cises, then to attract the attention and stimulate the mental faculties by object teach- 
ing, with singing, simple studies, Kindergarten plays, and pleasant industries. 
STATE REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Connecticut State Reform School, Meriden, closed its thirty-second year November 
30, 1883, with 406 boys remaining on its list out of 614 that had been present some 
part of the year, 208 having in that time been discharged. The system pursued is a 
combination of moral, religious, and school instruction, with training in productive 
industries that may prepare for self support. The family plan of housing the boys 
was extended during the year by the addition of 2 cottages to the 1 before reported, 
so that 2 new sets of 50 each might be withdrawn from the main building and put 
under the care of a man and wife, with a competent teacher, as soon as the buildings 
should be completed and furnished. 
The Connecticut Industrial School for Girls, Middletown, closed its fourteenth year 
December 1, 1883, with 195 inmates out of 585 received since the opening of the school 
in January, 1870. The whole number under care during the year had been 249, of 
whom 54 had been placed in homes or otherwise disposed of. The training is in or- 
dinary school studies, morals, and religion, as well as in household work, sewing, 
paper box making, laundering; and the success of this training, aided by good fam- 
ily influences in separate homes, has been so great that the demand for girls to assist 
in housekeeping, in the care of children, and in other useful work has come to be far 
beyond the supply. After leaving the school they are visited by an agent and are 
corresponded with till they are 21 years of age. 
TRAINING OF ORPHANS,

ing given in them in 1882~’83, see Table XXII, Part 1, of the appendix.

| EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
| CONNECTICUT STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-seventh annual meeting of this body was held in the hall of the New 
Haven High School, October 18-20, 1883, ‘‘a large number of principals and teachers 
being present from all parts of the State.” The address of the first evening, after 
words of welcome from J. G. Lewis, of New Haven, was froui Rev. Joseph T. Duryea, 
D D., of Boston, Mass., on ‘The motive fo to earnest study,” and is said to have 
aroused much enthusiasm. The first discussion of the next morning was ‘The rela- 
tion of the public library to the public school,” Superintendent Harrington, of Bridge- 
port, giving the general report of the committee appointed to consider it and dwelling 
on the importance of influencing pupils to choose good books and read them thought- 
fully. Other subjects presented were ‘The relation of the public library to the gram: 
mar school and high school,” ‘The teachers’ work in directing pupils to the use of the 
public library,” and ‘‘The teachers’ own use of such a library.” Secre Charles 
D. Hine, of the State board of education, then gave a review of the Connecticut school 
system from the beginning, some two hundred and fifty years ago, when standards 
were high and studies few and a generous taxation gave the schools a good support; 
sketched the decline that came from 1712 to 1796, when ecclesiastical societies took 
school matters in hand, when taxes deciined, rate bills came in, and academies and 
lower private schools largely displaced the common school; and finally showed how, 
from 1796, the sale of western Jands owned by the State threw the support of schools 
again on pablic funds, with lightened taxation and with still inferior results, till’ in 
1846 fifty more years of unsatisfactory results made the State ready for a return to 
the spirit of the old system, since which there bas been gradual improvement, till 
now the best schools of the State rank well with any in other States, 
Several other important topics were discussed, among them one by Superintendent 
Seaver, of Boston, on the edvantages of elementary manual training in connection 
with public schools, and ove by President Porter, of Yale College, on the power of 
‘the personal element in teaching. 
After adopting resolutions in favor of well ordered public libraries as aids to school 
work, of a system of graded schools for every town, and of appropriations from the 
General Government for the instruction of Indians in Alaska, the association chose 
new officers and adjourned to meet at Hartford in 1884, 
The thirty-eighth annual meeting was held in the high school hall, Hartford, October 
23-25, 1884, with an attendance said to have been the largest ever known and with 
proceedings of great interest. On the first evening Mr. Wm. A. Mowry,! of Boston, 
delivered the opening address. The next morning Principal George L. Fox, of New 
Haven, presented a paper on ‘‘Teaching polities in public schools,” saying that there 
was need to prepare for the duties of citizenship by teaching patriotism. The right 
way of teaching ‘‘ The A B C of numbers” was next shown by Miss E. M. Reed, of the 
Welch Training School, New Haven, whose paper was so clear, practical, and useful 
that the association resolved to have it published for the use of teachers, and it will 
probably appear under State auspices in 1885. Prof, A. B. Morrill, of the State Nor- 
mal School, next presented ‘‘ Science conversations in the lower schools,” urging a 
drill in familiar objects of natural science, on the seashore, in the country round the 
school, and elsewhere, getting the children to gather specimens and become students 
of nature as well as of books. ‘‘Reading and how it should be taught” was then 
presented by Prof. E. H. Russell, of the Massachusetts State Normal School, Worcester. 
“The relation of learning to resins by F, E, Bangs, of New Haven, closed the 
program of papers to be read, and the last hour was given to class exercises in arith- 
metic by Miss Helen I’, Page, of the State Normal School, with a class of 20 pupils. 
CONNECTICUT COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, 
At a meeting of this council held in June, 1883, a committee, with the city super- 
intendent of New Haven at its head, was appointed te take into consideration the 
condition of the country schools and to report what efforts on the part of the council 
might tend to the improvement of those schools. At another meeting, in December 
of that year, the report of this committee was presented, stating that circular letters 
of inquiry had been addressed to each member of the boards of school visitors and 
boards of education of the several towns throughout the State. The questions asked 
were: Would the country schools become better (1) if district lines were obliterated 
and the towns hired and paid the teachers, as well as examined and supervised them; 
(2) if the State board were to hold annual examinations supplementary to those in 
towns; (3) if superintendencies were to be established over counties or groups of 
towns; (4) if the country work could be classified and the pupils of maturer age and *

higher grade be brought into a central school; and (5) if the best pupils were en- 
couraged to take a course in the State-Normal School before beginning to teach? 
The answers to these several questions are not fully formulated, but from them and 
from their own observations the members of the committee seem to have come to at 
least these conclusions: (1) that district lines had better be obliterated and that a 
central committee in each rural town should have power, by consent of parents, to 
gather children of the same grade into the same school room under the charge of one 
teacher; (2) that a State examination of teachers should supplement the town ex- 
aminations; (3) that there should be some more skilful supervision than can be had 
under the present country system, in which ‘all sorts of men, engaged in all sorts 
of business, knowing often nothing of the practical work of teaching,” are enga ed 
at $2 a day for actual service to superintend the country schools; (4) that whatever 
may be done as to general training in the normal school, at least the best of the 
graduates of high schools should be induced to take a year of study at that school 
before becoming teachers, and that candidates found by the faculty unfit for effective 
school work should be rejected, not advanced. 
The meeting of the council in 1884 was held at Hartford in June and discussed 
mainly the question of national aid to education, Superintendent Dutton, of New 
Haven, favoring such aid, as the safety of the Republic demands that voters be better 
educated ; Mr. Fox, of New Haven, holding that, where danger exists, sufficient au- 
thority to meet it also exists, and that the clause in the Constitution authorizing Cor 
gress to promote the general welfare carries the power to make educational appropri: 
tions. Mr. Charles D. Hine, secretary of the State board of education, taking the op- 
posite ground, held that there was no constitutional authority for such aid, nor was 
it expedient to give it; that the proposal to distribute aid to poor States on the basis 
of general illiteracy was a mistake, as, if distributed at all, it should be on the basis 
of illiteracy in children of school age; that the money distributed would be almest 
surely misused and would not accomplish its purpose; that schools and school sup- 
port must grow, and not be called into existence by money.

(From report of Hon, ThomasN. Williams, State superintendent of free schools, ap- 
parently for the calendar years 1882 and 1884 and reports of Henry C. Conrad, actuary 
of the Delaware Association for the Education of the Colored People, for the school 
years 18e2~83 and 1883-84.) 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State superintendent of free schools says that ‘considered as the growth of 
ten years the Delaware system of free schools is a most gratifying work. Never be- 
fore has public sentiment been so strong in favor of the support ot free public schools 
as to-day. The press of the State is a unit in their favor. The leading men of all 
parties and of all religious denominations acknowledge and defend the truth that the 
+ State has duties as well as rights, and that foremost among them is the duty of secur- 
ing a good common school education for the children of all classes.” He expresses a 
belief that in 1884 there was substantial progress, a belief which the statisties abun- 
dantly confirm as respects the schools for whites at least, while those for colored 
youth seem to have fairly held their own, though there has not been in them the ad-

vance that it was hoped might come from the considerable State appropriation made 
to them since 1881. 
The examinations of teachers, which began with the institution of a State school 
system worthy of the name in 1875, have been gradually disposing of the indifferent 
«school teachers and substituting for them others that endeavor to excel. And, though 
this process is necessarily a slow one, it is evident, from a variety of testimony, that 
there is, as the superintendent says, a marked improvement from year to year in the 
qualifications of the teachers and in the effectiveness of the school work done by them. 
he instruction given at teachers’ institut Jd aunually in each county in the State, 
with-assistance from distinguished educators, has aided wuch in this improvement of 
the teachers. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The supervision of the free schools for both white and colored children is committed 
toya, State superintendent of free schools, who is appointed annually by the governor 
is required to visit every schoel once a year, to examine persons proposing to 
h in them, to hold a yearly institute in each county for the improvement of 
hers, and, with the aid of a State board of education, to select the text books for 
the State schools, which, when purchased, he is to distribute to each school dis- 
stat cost. Since 1881 he has been allowed au assistant superintendent, who is also 
appointed annually by the governor. 
The State board includes the secreta f state and the president of Delaware Col- 
lege with the State superintendent. Besides aiding him in the selection of text books 
and commissioning teachers whom he finds qualified, it acts as a court of appeal 
in matters of controversy between him and minor State school officers or teachers. 
In each school distrf:t a school committee of 3 menibers, elected by the voters of the 
district, with annual change of 1, provides school buildings, furniture, and fuel, em- 
ploys teachers holding certificates from the State superintendent, makes regulations 
for the government of the school, holds it open for all white children over 6 years 
old, and levies an annual tax for its support. 
For colored children there is a special agency, sanctioned by the State, called the 
Delaware Association for the Education of Colored People, which (except in the city 
of Wilmington and in a small colored corporation elsewhere) provides, through its 
actuary, for schools of at least 3 months’ duration yearly. 
FINANCES, 
The means for the support of free schools for whites come (1) from the income of a 
State school fund, the proceeds of marriage and tavern licenses, one-fourth of the 
receipts from other licenses, and also one-fourth of the money arising from fees on 
commissions issued to prothonotaries, clerks of the peace, registers of wills, recorders 
of deeds, clerks of the orphans’ court, and sheriffs; (2) from an annual tax of $150 in 
each school district of New Castle County, of $120 in each school district of Kent 
County, and of $60 in each school district of Sussex County, these district taxes going 
to the schools of the districts in which they are levied, 
For the support of schools in which colored youth are to be taught there is an an- 
nual tax of 30 cents on $100 of the property of colored persons, and also an allowance 
from the State, which from 1881 to 1883 was $2,400 annually, but in 1884 was made 
$5,000, all distributed through the Delaware Association for the Education of the 
Colored People. 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
The only legislative action as to schools for the years covered by this report appears 
to have been the above noted increase of the State allowance to schools for colored 
youth and an act of April 19, 1883, extending the supervision of the State school officer 
to the schools of this class in addition to his previous supervision of the schools for 
whites, 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF WILMINGTON. 
OFFICERS. 
Wilmington has a board of public education consisting of 2 members from each of 
its 1L wards, eleeted for 2 years, with annual change of 1 from each ward. There is 
also a superintendent of schools, employed by the board. 
STATISTICS, 
1882~-'83, 
Population of the city by census of 1880, 42,585; children of school age (6-21), not 
given; school-houses in use, 20; school rooms, 131; sittings, 6,713; pupils enrolled, 
7,675; average belonging, 5,823; average daily attendance, 5,197; per cent. of attend- 
ance on average belonging, 89.2; teachers employed, 132, 4 of them in training school 
on trial, without salary; pay of those employed in full service, $300 to $1,300 a year;

whole expenditure for city schools, $124,067.1_ There was in the year an incréase of 
1 in school- houses used, of 15 in rooms for day pupils, and of 793 in sittings for study 
in all the day schools; while in enrolment the increase was 552; in average belong- 
ing, 632; in average daily attendance, 597" The 1 additional school-house noted is 
not a full indication of the increased accommodation, for 3 new school-houses were 
occupied at the beginning of the year, 2 of them taking the place of old rented ones. 
A large addition was made also to another building, these several imprevements giv- 
ing 1,208 additional seats for city pupils. The estimated value of school property 
after these improvements, including grounds, buildings, and apparatus, was $314,749. 
Besides the day schools, there appears to have been a night school held in one of the 
city school buildings under the auspices of a Citizens’ Night School Association, but no 
statistics of attendance in it are given. 
1883--'84, 
In this year the school-houses numbered 22;. the school rooms, 149; the sittings for 
study, 7,030; the enrolled pupils in day schools, 8,259; the average belonging. 6,374; 
the average daily attendance, 5,718; the teachers in the city day schools, 155; show- 
ing an increase of 2 in school-houses, of 18 in school rooms, of 377 in sittings, of 584 
in enrolment, of 551 in average belonging, of 521 in average daily attendance, and of 
23 in teachers employed. Increase in school property, $13,912. 
The schools for both white and colored pupils are included in these statistics. For 
the latter there were 4 schools, 10 rooms, 544 sittings, 11 teachers, with an enrolment 
of 817, an average belonging of 506, and an average daily attendance of 464, or 92 per 
cent. of the average belonging. 
For the first time, apparently, 2 evening schools were maintained by the city board 
during the winter, beginning November 5 and closing in February, the session in one 
covering 80 evenings; in the other, 62. Enrolment, 120; average attendance, 73; 
teachers, 4 for the entire term and 1 for 50 evenings; sessions, from 7 to 9 o’clock. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Statistics of two of this class of schools, both in Wilmington, may be found in Table 
V of the appendix; a summary of their statistics, in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS, 
Applicants for teacherships in the State free schools must prove to the State super- 
intendent the possession of a good moral character in all cases. Such as can add to 
this a demonstration of capacity to teach the common English branches, with history 
of the United States, elements of rhetoric, algebra, geometry, and natural philosophy, 
are entitled to first grade certificates, good for 3 years. Those who fail of this, but 
in their examination answer 90 per cent. of the questions asked in spelling, reading, 
writing, mental and written arithmetic, geography, history of the United States, 
and English grammar, receive second grade certificates, good for 2 years. A third 
grade certificate, good for 1 year only, is allowed to such as reach 60 per cent. at 
their examination in these latter studies. 
NORMAL TRAINING. 
Since the apparent cessation of the normal course at the State college no report 
has reached this Office of any specific training in methods or science of teaching, ex- 
cept in Wilmington, where 4 divisions in a city training school are annually taught 
by pupil teachers who are on trial as to their capacity for paid employment in such 
work, 
Something in this direction is probably done also at the teachers’ institutes which 
the State superintendent is required by law to held at least once a year in each of 
the 3 counties of the State, and which the teachers of the county are required to 
attend for such instruction as the superintendent may deem advisable and for a gen- 
eral interchange of views as to the means of improving both teaching and attendance. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State makes no specific provision for high schools, but the city of Wilmington 
has for many years,maintained one for each sex. The courses in these are of 3 years, 
including higher English branches, with book-keeping, science of government, and 
history of France and Rome for boys and of Greece and Rome for girls. Both have 
a fair intermixture of natural sciences, but no studies in ancient or foreign languages. 
Enrolment in 1882~83, 169.

  DELAWARE. AT 
Lewes and Dover are known to have had high schools in past years and may still 
maintain them. 
OTHER SECONDARY TRAINING. 
Ten academic schools, private or incorporated, appear to have existed in this State 
in 183283. For those reported in 1883-’34, see Tables IV and VI of the appendix to 
this volume. One of these schools is the Newark Academy, which serves to some 
extent as a preparatory school for the State college. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
DELAWARE (STATE) COLLEGE, FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Delaware College, Newark, formerly known as Newark College and chartered 
under its present title in 1867, admits both sexes. By act of assembly of 1369 each 
county in the State is entitled to have 10 students educated at the college free, such 
students to be designated by the members of the legislature. The college offered for 
1gx3-'e4 three courses, a classical, a scientific and agricultural, and a literary course, 
each of 4 years. The last is open to all, but is more especially designed for young 
women, who are allowed time for instruction in music, though it is not one of the 
studies in the college. German and French are taught, but Latin is optional in the 
senior year, ch of the above courses leads to its corresponding degree. Graduates 
that have received the degree of B. A. or B, 8. may after 3 more years of study receive 
the degree of A. M. or M. 8.    
  
   
COLLEGE FOR WOMEN. 
Wesleyan Female College, Wilmington (Methodist Episcopal), is the only college 
in the State for young women only. It has primary and preparatory departments, 
and, for the collegiate, students may choose between a 3-year English and a 4-year 
classical course, the former comprising English studies only and the latter adding 
German, French, and Latin. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific and agricultural department of Delaware College offers a well ar- 
ranged 4-year course leading to the degree of B. s. This includes German, French, 
Latin, civil engineering, physics, sanitary science, pure and applied chemistry, and 
dah Tory practice. Military drill is required of all students during the spring and 
‘all terms,    
PROFESSIONAL. 
As far as can be ascertained, no schools for systematic instruction in theology, law, 
or medicine have yet been established in this State, the advantages for all such 
instruction being amply afforded in Philadelphia. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
TRAINING OF DEAF-MUTES, BLIND, ETC. 
Information as to the education of deaf-mute, blind, and feeble-minded children at 
State expense has been sought in vain from State authority; but it is believed that 
such education is provided for, as in previous years, at the institutions for these 
classes in the neighboring States, Pennsylvania and Maryland. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
DELAWARE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association was established in 1879 at Rehoboth Beach, and in 1884 the sixth 
annual meeting was held at the same place and is said to have been in every way a 
success. These meetings, presided over by some of the ablest teachers of the State, 
are reported by the State superintendent to have been the means of bringing the 
various workers in the educational field into closer and more intimate association, 
while through lecturers brought in from other States much practical information as 
to methods of school work has been imparted to both State school teachers and prin- 
cipals and instructors in private schools. The bonds of union between these differe 
ent classes have also, it is stated, been made much more strong.

eHon. George P. Raney, attorney general, presents in the Peabody fund report of 1884 a state- ment from the Weekly Floridian of April 1 of that year, that the permanent invested school fund in- 
creased from $250,284 in 1882 to $429,984 in 1884, 
(From reports of Hon. E. K. Foster and Hon. Albert J. Russell, State superintend- 
ents of public instruction, for the two years indicated, with some figures from Hon, 
George P. Raney, in the Peabody fund report for 1884.) 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Statistics from this State are very imperfect, rendering impossible such comparison 
of year with year as might show whether progress has been made or not. Super- 
intendent Foster, in his report for 1882-83, estimates that there had been an increase 
that year of at least 245 in the number of public schools taught. The exact number 
could not be given on account of the failure ef 9 county superintendents to report. 
In regard to other items the statistics were so imperfect that he did not even under- 
take to make an estimate. He was confident, however, that there had been an in- 
crease during the year, both in the number of pupils attending public schools and in 
the length of term. 
The successor of Mr. Foster, Superintendent Russell, reported for 1883-84 a greatly 
increased interest on the part of the people in the work of the schools. The number of . 
schools sustained had increased in two years by 270; the pupils enrolled, by 55,585, 
A-census of the youth of school age taken in 1884 showed an increase of only 6,662 
over the number reported in 1880, but this, the superintendent thinks, is much below 
the actual increase. Owing to the inaccessibility of a large portion of the population      
-P-A-G-E-321
FLORIDA. 49 
and the small pay allowed assessors, the work was probably imperfectly done. It is, 
however, evident that the school resources of the State are onthe way to a consider- 
able improvement; that the interest of the people in the schools is increasing in the 
better portions of the State; and that, in the numerous institutes now held, as well as 
in the normal schools established, there is promise of a higher grade of teaching, 
which must soon make a decided impression on the schools. With the new interest 
thus aroused, it may be even hoped that the 9 counties which for many years have 
failed to make any report whatever of schools taught will be induced to do some- 
thing towards the education of their children. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected for 4-year terms at the gen- 
eral election for State officors, has the administrative supervision of all matters per- 
taining to the public school system. The superintendent, secretary of state, and 
attorney general constitute a State board of education for charge and management 
of school lands, safe keeping and disbursement of school funds, and appointment of a 
board of education for each county. These county boards, not to exceed 5 members, 
act as agents of the State board in the care of school lands and distribution of school 
fands, and are to locate and maintain schools for at least 3 months each year wher- 
ever needed, appointing for each school or group of schools from 1 to 5 trustees as 
local supervisors. A county superintendent, appointed by the governor for 2-year 
terms, acts as secretary and agent of each county board, visiting the schools and 
looking into their condition. ‘Teachers are employed and text books chosen by the 
county boards; but before employment each teacher must present a certificate of 
qualification, for which, see Preparation and Qualifications of Teachers, further on. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The means for the support of the State public schools come (1) from the interest 
of a common school fund, distributed among the counties in proportion to the num- 
ber of children in each between 4 and 21 years of age; (2) from a State school tax of 
not less than 1 mill on $1 annually ; (3) from an annual county tax, not to be less than 
half the amount apportioned for the year from the State school fund. 
To these resources the trustees of the Peabody fund added for 1882~83 $1,150 for 
public schools, $775 for teachers’ institutes, and $1,000 for scholarships at the South- 
ern Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. ; for 1883-’84, the sum of $1,100, of which the 
superintendent reports having expended $600 in aid of public schools and $260 for 
teachers’ institutes and normal schools. The $1,000 for scholarships at Nashville 
were renewed this year.   NEW LEGISLATION. 
An act of March 1, 1883, required county boards of education that had not provided 
for uniform text books in their schools to meet May 7 of that year and adopt a series 
of text books for use in them for at least 5 years, said series to be obligatory on the 
trustees and teachers of their several counties. Another, of the same date, prohibited 
dealing in such text books on the part of school officers. 
An act of March 5, 1883, appropriated $1,000 for that year and the same for the 
next to meet the expenses of teachers’ institutes to be held under the direction of the 
State superintendent, who should designate the places for them and report respecting 
them. Another act of the same date authorized the superintendent to cobperate with 
the boards of trustees of the East and West Florida Seminaries, with the superintend- 
ents of the counties in which those seminaries lie, and with the trustees of Lincoln 
Academy, Tallahassee, and Union Academy, Gainesville, in the establishment of nor- 
mal departments in those seminaries and academies for training persons in the art of 
teaching such branches as are usually studied in the common schools. The diplomas 
of graduation from the departments to be thus established are to have the force of 
teachers’ certificates. For such departments in 1883 there was appropriated $3,000, 
and the same amount in 1884, 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
‘ 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The only cities with sufficient population for notice under this head are Jackson- 
ville and Key West, and these have no organized city school systems, the schools of 
both being simply parts of the county systems of Duval and Monroe Counties. The 
superintendents and boards of education of these counties have the supervision of 
the schools, which embrace all grades from primary to high, but no statistics of them 
are attainable apart from those of the county schools,

b | PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
Persons purposing to teach in the public schools must present evidence of good 
moral character, of the requisite literary qualifications, and of acquaintance with the 
art of imparting instruction and managing a school. On compliance with these con- 
ditions, they may, after an examination by the State superintendent, by the board 
of education of the county in which they wish to teach, or by the county superin- 
tendent, receive certificates, those from the State superintendent good throughout 
the State, those from the county board or county superintendent good in the county 
from the authorities of which they are received. The certificates given are of 3 
grades, according to qualification and success in school work. In future, as may be 
seen below, certiticates of graduation from State normal schools will have equal force 
with these. a 
STATE NORMAL DEPARTMENTS, 
To prepare persons for teaching in the public schools, the East Florida Seminary, 
Gainesville, added, apparently in 1880, a school of didactics and pedagogics to its gen- 
eral English and classical courses. This in 1831-82 and 1882~s3 covered 2 regular 
sessions of 36 weeks each, with a normal term of 6 weeks at the close of each regular 
session. Under the changed title of a normal class and an apparent shortening of the 
time by 1 year, to follow 2 years of English studies, essentially the same general ar- 
rangements were continued in 1883-04, in which year 25 normal students, under 3 
teachers, were reported. 
The West Florida Seminary, Tallahassee, shows also arrangements for the training 
of persons in the art of teaching, and the State report for 1883—e4 shows 15 normal stu- 
dents and 59 others, under 7 professors. 
As stated under the head of New Legislation, preceding, an act of March 5, 1883, pro- 
vided for the addition of normal departments also to the Lincoln Academy, Tallahas- 
see, and the Union Academy, Gainesville, for the preparation of colored teachers, di- 
plomas of graduation to have the force of teachers’ certificates. 
The law under which the two seminaries first named were created, January 1, 1851, 
says that “their first purpose shall be the instruction of persons, male and female, in 
the art of teaching all the branches that pertain to a good common school education.” 
This will now apply to the two academies also, at each of which normal instruction 
was begun in July and August, apparently of 1882~83, in special schools for teachers 
held outside of the regular sessions, with 94 pupilsin attendance, 47 ateach place. The 
best available teachers were employed in them and excellent results were obtained, 
as was shown by subsequent improvement in the schools of those teachers who 
attended, ‘ 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Cookman Institute, Jacksonville, in its catalogue for 1883-’84, gives a list of 
121 students in its 3 normal classes, the studies in which appear to embrace little be- 
yond elementary English branches, nothing being said of instruction in the science and 
methods of teaching. This school, which is for the colored race and includes both 
sexes, claims to have prepared more than 300 teachers and preachers for work among 
their people. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Since January, 1869, the State superintendent has been required by law “to as- 
semble teachers in institutes and employ competent instructors to impart informa- 
tion on improved methods of teaching and cond tate ee nool 3” but, from the poverty 
of the State for a large portion of that time, there has been such lack of appropria- 
tions for this OTEDES, that institutes were almost impracticable till the agent of the 
Peabody fund supplied the means for them in 1882. The appropriation of $1,000 by 
the legislature for institutes in 1883 and as much for 1884, betore referred to, removed. 
this difficulty, and Superintendent Russell held institutes in seven counties, many 
teachers of adjacent counties being present and participating. Institutes in six 
other counties were also arranged for, to be held in September, November, and De- 
cember, apparently in 1883; but definite information as to these is wanting. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No specific provision for high schools exists, except that each county board of ed- 
ueation is authorized to establish ‘‘schools of higher grades of instruction” where 
the advancement and number of pupils require them. Duval County, at least, hasa 
high school with a 3-year course, to supplement the instruction of its eight grades of 
primary and grammar schools. Key West is also believed to have one, and in 28
-P-A-G-E-323
  FLORIDA. 51 
other counties the State report of 1°81~’82 showed a considerable number of pupils in 
higher branches than those of the ordinary school course, but without intimation of 
high school courses. 
The East_and West Florida Seminaries serve substantially the purpose of high 
schools for Gainesville and Tallahassee, as well as for the counties in which they are 
situated. The Lincoln Academy, Tallahassee, and Union Academy, Gainesville, 
serve a like purpose for the colored race. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For the statistics of business colleges and private academic schools that may report 
themselves, see Tables IV and VI of the appendix to this volume. Prominent among 
the schools of academic class is the Cookman Institute, Jacksonville, before referred to, 
under Methodist influences, which has good buildings, a fair academic course, with 
collegiate titles for its 4-year classes, but as yet no indications of any full collegiate 
work. Students in this department, 40 in 1583-84; in preparatory and intermediate 
departments, which embrace only English studies, 136, making, with the normal be- 
fore noticed, a total of 297 pupils, under 7 instructors. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGE FOR YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN. 
An announcement comes from an official source that ‘‘in February, 1883, the Florida 
University was organized under a liberal charter.” As thus organized, it is meant 
to embrace 5 colleges: a college of literature and science, a polytechnic and normal 
institute, a theological institute, a college of law, and a college of medicine and 
surgery. The first and last of these are said to be the only ones put into actual 
operation under this new movement. 
The college of literature and science is an expansion of the West Florida Seminary 
at Tallahassee, which in 1823 and 1845, in common with a kindred seminary in East 
Florida, received from Congress an endowment of two townships of land for each. 
On this endowment both have been for many years maintained as seminaries, with 
literary and thilitary departments, and some preparatory classes in the last few years. 
Now the western one is given the higher title of university, with a faculty that com- 
prises a president, who is also professor of mathematics, engineering, and military 
tactics; a professor of ancient languages; one of English literature and history; one 
of modern languages ; and an emeritus professor of political economy. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Both the literary and medical departments above mentioned are to be open to young © 
women in common with young men, For any other opportunities of securing higher 
education offered to young women in this State, see Table VIII of the appendix to 
this report. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Florida State Agricultural College has been located at Lake City, whose citi- 
zens gave the institution 100 acres of land and $15,000 for building purposes. Dur- 
ing the year 1383~’84 a commodious building was completed, the faculty elected, and 
the courses of study arranged. These embrace classical, literary, philosophical, and 
3 scientific courses, general, engineering, and agricultural. Opportunities for the 
practical application of the theories taught are to be furnished by the laboratory, the 
field, and farm, and it is said that in no case will the diploma of the institution be 
granted to those unfamiliar with the arts connected with the course of study pur- 
sued. The horticultural branch of the agricultural department is to receive special 
attention. Military science will be taught by a competent instructor. The degree 
of bachelor of arts is to be given to graduates of the literary as well as the classical 
. course, although students in the latter substitute French or German for Greek. Free 
tuition is offered to as many students, residents of the State, as there are members of 
the legislature, selected by the boards of education of the several counties. 
That some scientific training is to be given in the newly organized State University 
is implied in the facts (1) that the president of the literary faculty is professor of 
mathematics and engineering and (2) that there is a professor of chemisiry, while a 
polytechnic institute enters into the plan for future years. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
It appears from the announcement of the departments to be established in connec- 
tion with the university that a theological institute is one, but, as such an institute 
would have to be strictly non-sectarian and avoid all points of theology not held in 
common by the various christian denominations, its range of instruction would neces-
-P-A-G-E-324
     BZ |-| REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
sarily be very narrow, and few, if any, pupils would be likely to be drawn to it. The 
establishment of that branch of the university is therefore probably a thing of tho 
far future. Some preparation for the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
appears to be given in the ‘‘ biblical classes” of the Cookman Institute, Jacksonville, 
a school for thé instruction of the colored race. In these classes 19 were enrolled in 
1883~84, of which number 7 were in theological and 12 in catechetical stndies. 
The Law College mentioned is much more in the line of present needs, and may pos- 
sibly be organized before long. 
The College of Medicine and Surgery appears to have been organized simultaneously 
with the literary department of the university, in the winter of 1883. It is so eclec- 
tic in character that it will not attempt to decide as to ihe merits of different systems 
of practice, but welcomes students of either sex, not attempting to bind them to any 
method of practice afte duation. All that it asks for graduation is suitable age, 
good moral character, a fair literary or common school education, satisfactory examina- 
tion in every branch of medicine, and payment of the examination fee, r 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
INSTITUTION FOR DEAF-MUTES AND THE BLIND. 
In 1833 provision was made by the legislature for the establishment of a school in 
which indigent deaf-mutes and the blind from 6 to 21 years of age might receive free 
instruction, such others as could pay for the instruction to have also the privilege of 
entrance on payment of the actual cost of teaching and support. The chief State 
officers were made trustees, and an appropriation of $10,000 for nd as much for 
1884 were made for a beginning of this good work. St. Augus e secured the loca- 
tion of the institution by a gift of five acres of land and $1,000 in cash; plans were 
made for a group of buildings, costing $12,749, to accommedate both races, and during 
1884 they were completed in a satisfactory manner. <A priucipal was appointed by 
the board of managers and at the date of the State superintendent’s report the institu- 
tion was being made ready for the reception of pupils. 
REFORMATORY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
State Superintendent Russell calls the attention of the legislature to the necessity 
for a reformatory industrial school, to which may be sent vagrant children who will 
neither attend the public schools nor work, from whose ranks come a large portion 
of the criminals that fill the prisons. With the large surplus of funds in the State 
treasury he advises the purchase of a large tract of fertile land, suitable buildings to 
. be erected on it, includiug workshops for the various trades, so that these children who 
are now growing up to be a curse to themselves and to society may be taught farming 
and other employments and become useful members of society.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
A table presented by State School Commissioner Orr at the opening of his report for 
188:} and 1884 shows that both enrolment in the public schools and average attendance 
in them have steadily increased: the former, since the institution of the present State 
   
-P-A-G-E-326

54 | REPORT OF THE -COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
school system in 1871; the latter, since it came first into the report in 1874. The figures 
for each annually present greatly larger totals, though the ratio of increase has varied 
in different years considerably. Such steady growth for so many years is creditable 
to the State that has furnished the means for securing it and to the excellent State 
commissioner, whose wise and courteous administration has smoothed the way through 
many obs acles to its present great success. 
From 1882 to 1883 the increase in enrolment in the public schools was 30,979, a 
greater growth than in any other year since 1874, while the average attendance in 
such schools was nearly 10,000 higher than in any previous year, being 24,191 more than 
in 1882. The aggregate amount spent for the State schools was in 1883 increased by 
$29,473 beyond the $084,174 of 1882, and, as may be seen, the percentages secured, of 
enrolment to school youth, of average attendance to enumeration, and of the reported 
enrolment in all schools to the total number of school age, are somewhat higher. The 
rons difficulty in the way of still fuller and more effective progress is lack of funds 
for increasing the annual school term, which now averages only about three months, 
except in cities, where it is reported that the average term,covers about nine months. 
The reports from private schools and from colleges are so indefinite and contain so 
many gaps that the full amount of education given, while greater than reported, can- 
not be accurately stated. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
AState board of education composed of the chief State officers, with the governor as 
president, holds in trust grants and devises for educational purposes and acts as a 
court of appeals in questions relating to school law. A State school commissioner, ap- 
pointed biennially by the governor, is a member of this board and its executive officer 
‘or the distribution of school funds, supervision of schoolinterests, and biennial report 
of school affairs. Each county (except 4 under special local laws) has a county board 
of education of 5 members, selected for 4-year terms by the grand jury of the county, 
subject to partial biennial change. A secretary, chosen by each board fora 4-year 
term, acts as county commissioner of education, with duties similar to those of county 
superintendents elsewhere. ‘The county boards choose for each subdistrict into which 
their counties may be divided 3 trustees for local supervision of schools, one to be 
liable to change each year. 
The public schools (and private schools with which arrangements for public school in- 
struction have been made) are free to all the children residing in the subdistricts where 
they exist; but separate schools for white and colored children are required to be 
maintained, and only elementary branches may be taught, except in counties and 
cities that have been favored with special early franchises. The county boards of 
education, with like exception, prescribe the text books for their schools. The 
county commissioners examine persons that desire to teach and license such as are 
found to be qualified. The licenses are of 4 grades, according to capacity and prep- 
aration, covering 3 years, 2 years, 1 year, and six months, this last meant only for low 
grade country schools, As arule, the teachers are to teach sessions of at least 3 
months each year, but, in sparsely settled counties where the county boards cannot 
keep up their schools for that full time, they are allowed to maintain “ambulatory 
schools” in successive neighborhoods for two months only in each case, so locating 
them as to reach the majority of the children to be taught and so arranging the 
school terms as to make it possible for one teacher to serve in 2, 3, or more of said 
schools, each to contain not less than 15 pupils. Evening schools are also provided 
for. Of all schools taught under the State system the teachers must make report to 
their county school commissioner, or some special school officer, at the expiration of 
each term; and until such report is made no pay may be received. The same rule 
holds as to commissioners. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The funds for the support of public schools come from a poll tax not to exceed $1 
on each voter; from taxes on shows and exhibitions (such as circuses'and their 2¢- 
companying side shows); from taxes on dealers in intoxicating drinks and on dealers 
in pistols, revolvers, dirks, or bowie knives; from the net proceeds of fees for ia- 
specting fertilizers and for the hire of convicts; with the dividends from State shares 
in one railway and from one-half the rental of angther. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY AND SLATER FUNDS. 
The trustees of the Peabody fund for the promotion of education in the South gave 
$5,900 to the State in 188283, of which sum $1,000 went to the public schools ; $500 to 
Atlanta University, for the training of colored teachers for such schools; $2,000 to 
teachers’ institutes; and $2,400 for normal scholarships at Nashville, for Georgia stu- 
dents. During 1883~84 there were granted from the same fund $2,400 for scholarships 
at Nashville, $2,000 for teachers’ institutes, and $500 for public schools in the city 
of Americus. 
From the Slater fund, founded by Mr. John F, Slater, of Norwich, Conn., Atlanta, 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
GEORGIA. 55 
University, Clark University, and the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary received 
$2,000 each in 1882~83, and Lewis High School, Macon, $200, all believed to be dis- 
bursed through the State school commissioner and all meant to further education 
pong the colored people, with the special idea of fitting them to become teachers for, 
their race. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities that have 2,000 or more inhabitants may form independent school systems, 
under boards of education or trustees of schools; judges of courts and mayors of 
cities may act as members ex officio of the boards. Augusta, Macon, and Savannah 
combine county and city systems, each city employing a superintendent.

a Census of 1880. b Includes whole county. 
Atlanta in 1883 was reported as having no pupil in the public schools, either white 
or black, that had not been vaccinated. As a consequence, not a pings pupil had the 
small-pox, though many were exposed to it. A suspension of the schools during the 
month of December, however, did much to derange the instruction of the year. The 
experimental introduction of colored teachers for colored schools, noted in 1862, con- 
tinued to prove successful, meeting the expectations of the colored people and satis- 
fying their desire for teaching from persons of their own race. Sixteen such teachers 
were employed in 2 of the 3 colored schools; in the remaining 1 there were still 4 
white teachers. This appears to have remained the arrangement for the next year 
also, when another suspension of the schools in December was only averted by the 
teachers, who as a body, with consent of the schoo) board, continued to teach till 
Christmas, and thus kept their schools and grades intact through the full 10-month 
course provided for. Considerable additions were made in both years to the school 
accommodations, and thus many children that had been kept out of school by lack of 
room were admitted, and this without excessive crowding, though further provision 
for a growing school population was still much needed. The valuation of public 
solicol property was $150,000; the estimated enrolment in private and church schools, 
000. 
In Augusta the public schools were taught 84 months during 188384, against 9 
months the year previous. A large lot was bought by the trustees at the end of Tel- 
fair street, on which to erect a school-house large enough for all the factory children. 
and others of that neighborhood. The colored schools were doing good work, with 
an enrolment of 1,268 pupils, under 15 teachers. At the opening of these schools the 
enrolment is overwhelming and the attendance is full until the spring months, when 
it begins to fall off, continuing, however, to be from 50 to 60 in each school, which is 
enough to keep all the teachers fully employed. 
Columbus for 1882~83 reports 7 school buildings for primary and grammar grades, but 
none for high schools; rooms for instruction, 27 ; public school property, estimated at 
$44,000; school days in the year, 195, of which 188 were occupied in teaching. Music 
entered into the instruction given, a special teacher of it receiving $90 a year for vocal 
and $2 a month for each scholar in instrumental music. In private and church schools 
there was an estimated attendance of 275 pupils. 
Macon at the opening of 1882-83 reduced the time for the grammar school course (which 
appears to include primary as well) to 6 years under an impression that this would suf- 
fice to prepare for the high school, - It also, towards the close of the year and for the

next, entered on the policy of employing women as principals of the grammar schools. 
The latter proved thoroughly successful, securing both excellent management and 
thorough teaching. The: former appears to be yet on trial. Other experiments are 
thought to have proved useful, such as concentrating efforts to teach reading especially 
on the first three years of the course, doing away with text book instruction in gram-: 
mar in the lower grades, using in spelling exercises words in common use, and insist- 
ing upon thorough acquaintance with these before the spelling book is taken up. 
Another change, more questionable, is that requiring from the children, after the first 
four fundamental processes in arithmetic, a large amount of mental work without 
pencil and slate or paper. Remarkable results are said to be secured in this line, but 
it may be doubted whether it is a safe process for all children. 
Savannah had in 1882~’83 the same connection of city and county schools that has 
been noticed in preceding years, as well as the connection of 2 Roman Catholic schools 
with the city system. Including these last, there were in the city 9 schools, 7 of 
them for white pupils, 2 for colored; while in the county there were 22 more, 6 of 
them for whites and 16 for colored. The statistics given in the preceding tables are 
for the city schools alone. Adding those of the county, there were in all 31 schools, 
with 79 teachers and 4,504 pupils. The classes in the various schools were generally 
fall during the entire school year, and in the lower grades there was considerablo 
crowding. The grades below the high school numbered 8; those in the boys’ high 
school are given as 3 in one place and as 4 in another; those in the girl’s high school 
as4,

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
Applicants for license to teach in the primary schools are to be examined in the 
common branches, and those who wish to teach in higher grades, in the studies belong- 
ing to those grades. This examination in ordinary cases is by the county commis- 
sioner; in cities under special laws, by a committee on examinations. The licenses 
given are, in counties, of 4 grades, covering from 6 months to 3 years. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
No State school for the sole purpose of training teachers has been yet established, 
but since 1870 Atlanta University has received $8,000 annually from the State, mainly 
because of its usefulness in preparing young people of either sex for teaching in the 
public schools for colored people. The Middle Georgia and North Georgia Agricultural 
Colleges also do something towards preparing teachers for the schools for whites, both 
having recognized normal departments, which, by authority of the législature, are 
authorized to issue to duly prepared pupils certificates of proficiency that have the 
force of State licenses to teach in the public schools. The cities of Atlanta, Augusta, 
Columbus, Macon, and perhaps others have normal classes to prepare teachers for 
their schools or for schools elsewhere, and work in the same line is done by Clark 
University, Atlanta; by the Lewis High School, Macon; the Haven Normal School, 
Waynesboro’, and the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary. For such statistics of these 
as may be presented, see Table III of the appendix. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
Teachers’ institutes, each continuing 4 weeks, for white and colored teachers, were 
‘held at Albany, Barnesville, Covington, Dalton, Sandersville, and Way Cross in 1883 
through aid from the Peabody fund. Through like aid in 1884 such institutes wero 
held at Norcross, Macon, and Dalton. Their success, Dr. Orr says, was reasonably 
good; their effect'‘on those present “very fine.” There was, however, a hindrance 
to full success in the fact that in the months of July and August, the only ones in 
which experienced city teachers can be secured as institute instructors, the common 
schools were generally in operation; hence the teachers in country districts, who most 
need the instruction given at the institutes, could not attend in anything like the 
number to be desired. Instruction in the studies to be taught was given, but the 
main design was to show how they should be taught. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The cities of Americus, Atlanta, Augusta, Macon, Sandersville, and Savannah all 
have high schools as parts of their city school systems, the common rule being to 
have a separate one for each sex. Where.colored pupils are sufficiently advanced for
-P-A-G-E-329

high school instruction, separate high schools from those for whites are provided for 
them, the feature of separation of the sexes being usually retained in these also. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. : 
Of private schools, 94 are presented in the report of the State school commissioner 
for 1883, with 172 teachers and 6,034 pupils, all white. 
For business colleges, academic schools for secondary instruction, preparatory 
schools, and preparatory departments of colleges reported to this Bureau, see Tables 
IV, VI, VU, IX, and X of the appendix to this volume. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Georgia, Athens (non-sectarian), offers in its collegiate depart- 
ment classical, scientific, and literary courses of 4\years each. It has also agricult- 
ural, mechanical, legal, and medical departments, as well as 4 branch agricultural 
colleges in different parts of the State. As a university it confers the degrees of M. 
A., C.E., L. B., and M. D.; in its academic department (Franklin College) it gives the 
customary A. B., B. s., and PH. B.; in its State college (of agriculture and mechanic 
arts), those of AG, B., ENG. B., B. CHEM. 8. Its academic studies are pursued in 10 
schools, the subjects in which are so arranged as to be combined into departments 
for different types of culture. The catalogue of 1883-’84 shows in all the collegiate 
departments a total attendance of 478, of whom 203 were in the Franklin College, 
State College, and law school, Athens; 122 in the medical department, Augusta; and 
153 in the collegiate departments of the 4 branch colleges at Cuthbert, Dahlonega, 
Milledgeville, and Thomasville. These branch colleges had also in primary and pre- 
paratory classes 619 pupils, making an aggregate of 1,097 pupils and students. Other 
institutions claiming collegiate rank are Atlanta University, Atlanta (non-sectarian) ; 
Clark University, Atlanta (Methodist); Mercer University, Macon (Baptist); Pio 
Nono College, Macon (Roman Catholic); and Emory College, Oxford (Methodist 
Episcopal). All these have 4-year classical and all but Mercer preparatory courses. 
Atlanta and Clark Universities, for colored students of either sex, in addition to full 
collegiate instruction, give normal and industrial training, teaching young men the 
elements of mechanical trades and farming, and young women nursing, sewing, and 
general housework. Both give instruction in music and the latter offers a business 
course. Emory College includes the study of Greek during the entire course, with 
Hebrew for the junior and senior years; it also presents a course in vocal music cov- 
ering 3 years. Pio Nono offers commercial instruction, military drill, and a grad- 
uate course. 
From Bowdon, Gainesville, and Methodist Colleges and from College Temple on 
reports have been received. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Atlanta and Clark Universities and the branch agricultural colleges at Dahlonega 
and Milledgeville offer equal instruction to both sexes. For statistics of schools ex- 
clusively for young women, see Table VIII of the appendix to this volume, and for a 
summary thereof, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
For instruction of this class the State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic 
Arts, Athens, offers 3 courses of 4 years, in agriculture, horticulture, and natural his- 
tory, engineering, and chemistry (the first and last being at present consolidated), 
with a course in architecture and building, of undefined length. Some scientific in- 
struction is found in Atlanta and Clark Universities and in the 4 branch colleges of 
the State University, at Cuthbert, Dahlonega, Milledgeville, and Thomasville ; while 
Emory and Mercer present special scientific courses of 3 years each, and Pio Nono, 
one of 4 years. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction was given to some extent in Atlanta and Clark Universities 
(Congregational and Methodist) and in the Atlanta Baptist Seminary’ for colored 
students, while Mercer University (Baptist) in its theological department prepared 
students for the ministry. Emory College (Methodist) gave biblical instruction 
throughout its entire collegiate course, including the Greek Testament and Hebrew, 
as an aid to preparation for the ministry. The Theological Seminary at Columbia 
(Southern Presbyterian) began its second session since the reopening in 1882, Sep- 
tember 17, 1883, and continued it to May 8, 1884, with 4 professors and 34 students, 
1 At this seminary, out of 147 students, all males, 54 were preparing for ministerial work in 1883.

coming from 9 States and representing 13 colleges and universities. All but 4 of these 
students were in the regular 3-year course, those 4 taking a special course. The in- 
struction ene in science and revelation, didactic theology, pastoral theology, exegesis 
of the Old and New Testament, biblical and ecclesiastical history, chureh polity, 
mental and moral philosophy, Hebrew, and homiletics. A beginning of instruction 
in elocution was also made, and hereafter that important aid to efficiency is to enter 
into the regular course of teaching, i 
Legal instruction is given in the law department of the State University, Athens, ina 
1-year course, the former recommendation of a 2-year course having withdrawn, 
There are 2 classes, junior and senior, and students may enter either class, if prepared, 
but must remain at least one term of 6 months before graduating. Diplomas are con- 
ferred at the end of the course, which admit graduates to the bar of the superior courts 
of Georgia without further examination. Emory College and Mercer University offer 
also legal instruction, covering one collegiate year, and graduates are admitted to prac- 
tice in the State without further examination. 
Medical instruction in this State has been judiciously regulated by an act of 1881, 
which makes it unlawful for any medical college in it to grant diplomas, except to 
students that have attended 2 or more full courses of study in a regularly chartered 
medical college of good standing and have passed a creditable examination before 
the faculty or the individual professors in all the branches usually taught in such 
colleges. The penalty for violation of this provision is $5,000, half to go to the infor- 
mant, the remainder to the county treasury, for educational purposes. 
The “regular” schools acting under this law in 1882~83 and 1833-84 were Atlanta 
Medical College and Southern Medical College, Atlanta, and the Medical College of 
Georgia, Augusta, the last a department of the University of Georgia. These had 
courses, respectively, of 18, 19, and 17 weeks each year. All 3 complied with the law 
in requiring attendance on at least 2 lecture courses of these lengths, and the last 2 
mentioned recommended a full graded course of 3 years. The total number of stu- 
dents in the 3 was 277 in 1882~’83, The last named reports 122 students in 1883~84 and 
a faculty enlarged by the addition of 6 specialists. Students at the two others, 200. 
No homeopathic school appears in 1882~’83 or 1%83-’84. 
The eclectic schools were, as before, the College of American Medicine and Surgery 
and the Georgia Eclectic Medical College, both at Atlanta, the first with 2 lecture 
courses of 16 weeks each annually, the other with 1 of 20 weeks. Students in the two, 
91 in 1882~83. The next year the former school was merged in the latter. 
For separate statistics of each school reporting, see Table XIII, appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. | 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Georgia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Cave Spring, dur- 
ing the year 188384, had 93 pupils, 40 of whom were girls, all under 5 instructors, 1 be- 
ing a deaf-mute and 2semi-mutes. The methods of instruction were oral and manual 
combined, the common English branches being taught, with industrial training in 
shoemaking. The institution is supported by the State, the value of the buildings 
and grounds being $40,000, with a library of 1,000 volumes. The total number of 
pupils instructed at the school since its organization in 1846 is 325. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
No report from the Georgia Academy for the Blind, Macon, has been received. 
INSTRUCTION OF ORPHANS.

reported for 1883~84, see Table XXII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The Georgia Teachérs’ Association met at Athens in the spring of 1883. State Su- 
perintendent Orr made an earnest and powerful appeal in behalf of the children of 
poverty and ignorance. The matter of special interest in the convention was the 
norma! school discussion, which ended in adopting resolutions urging the legislature 
to establish a normal school.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
This State, from its natural resources and geographical position, has had great ad- 
vantages for drawing into it a population not only large, but also intelligent and 
active. It has added much to these advantages by early adopting a good school
-P-A-G-E-332
  60 REPORT OF TIE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
system, with free schools of all grades from primary to high, with normal colleges to 
prepare teachers for such schools, with a university to invite to high udies still, 
and with large funds from the sale of its United States school lands in giving 
all these schools a generous support. The result has been for many years a most en- 
couraging advance in enrolment in the schools, in average attendance on them, in the 
quality of the teaching, and hence in the growth of a well trained native population, 
ready for any business or work. The statistics given for 1882~83 and 1833~84 show 
that this advance has gone on for these two years, notwithstanding great financial 
troubles in the latter one. The graded schools have continued to gain on the un- 
graded; average attendance, on enrolment and school youth; teachers trained in 
institutes, on those that have Jacked such training ; those teaching in graded schools, 
on those teaching i ungraded ones; while libraries as aids to teaching have consid- 
erably advanced in number and advanced much more in the number of their books. 
An encouraging increase in the pay of teachers, expenditure for schools, valuation of 
schcol property, and permanent school funds is also noted. The increase in youth of 
school age from 1882 to 1884 was 31,707; in enrolment in graded schools in the same 
time, 33,085; in average daily attendance, 33,140. Where there is any falling off, it 
is almost wholly where small country districts, too poor to pay a good school teacher, 
were consolidated, or where graded districts with no schools diminished and ungraded 
schools were superseded by graded schools.     
    
     
       
        
    ADMINISTRATION, 
A superintendent of public instruction has the supervision of all the common 
schools in the State, and it is his duty to report their condition bicnnially ; a county 
superintendent visits the schools in each county to note the methods of discipline 
and teaching and to assist teachers and school officers in improving them ; aus in 
each township a board of 3 trustees of schools has charge of public school-houses 
and sites, and, under certain restrictions, may divide or create districts, in which 
boards of 3 school directors have supervision and control. All these officers are 
elected by the people; the State and county superintendents, for 4 years; the others, 
for 3 years, with annual change of one. Women are eligible to any school office in 
the State, and several have been efficient county superintendents. 
The common schools are free to all of school age, irrespective of color. The studies 
to be pursued and the text books to be used are determined by the local school au- 
thorities ; but no sectarian instruction is allowed and nochange of text books oftener 
than once in 4 years. The minimum school period which will entitle districts to a 
share of the school fund is 110 days of actual teaching in one year; and, to prolong 
the yearly instruction to 9 months, the directors of districts and the authorities of 
villages and cities may levy annually a tax on property not to exceed 2 per cent. for 
educational and 3 per cent. for building purposes. The required studies are spelling, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, granimar, and geography; also, for higher classes, the 
eleuients of the natural sciences, United States history, physiology, and the laws of 
health. Other branches may be introduced at the discretion of the directors or 
voters of a school district. Free instruction is given in 2 State normal schools and in 
a State university. Persons undertaking to teach in any public school must prove 
their qualifications, moral and educational, before the proper officers, and must ob- 
tain certificates from-them to secure employment; and, when employed, must report 
in legal form and time to receive pay. Towards this pay for teachers, Illinois appro- 
priates $1,000,000 annually. The State appropriation goes to townships, villages, 
and cities in which schools have been taught 110 days, according to the number 
of persons of school age, as ascertained by an annual census. Any surplus of dis- 
trict, village, or city school funds may be expended for libraries and apparatus, and 
the statistics of the preceding table show that districts have availed themselves of 
this permission. In addition to the offer of free instruction to children 6 to 21 years 
of age, directors of schools and members of boards of education have been required 
since 1883 to enforce a compulsory law which demands the attendance of all children 
8 to 14 years of age upon public or private school for at least 12 weeks of each year, 
unless excused for reasonable cause.     
NEW LEGISLATION. i 
By an amendment made to section 51 of the school law in 1883 it was provided that county superintendents should charge each applicant for a teacher’s certificate or for a renewal of such certificate $1, and that the fees so collected should go to defray in 
each county the expenses of a teachers’ institute, to be held for not less than 5 days 
annually, The product of this new arrangement was for the first year $21,634.50, a great help towards institute work in 1884,

SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
Under a special law for cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, Chicago has a 
board of education of 15 members, appointed by the mayor with the advice and con- 
sent of the common council. Cities and school districts with 2,000 or more inhabi- 
tants, not governed by special law, have elective boards of education of 6 members 
till the population reaches 12,000, when three more members are added, and so on 
with every subsequent addition of 10,000 inhabitants. One-third of each board is 
liable to annual change. In most cases these boards employ superintendents, and 
delegate to them the supervision of schools, Chicago has also a deputy superintend- 
ent.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Alton, in 1882~83, with 5 school buildings, 25 rooms, and 1,255 sittings, kept its 
schools open for 194 days, and in 188384, with sittings increased to 1,319, kept them 
open for 193 days. No private or church schools are reported for either year. 
Superintendent Dapprich, of Belleville, says that in 1882~’83 the advantages of a 
thorough education were better appreciated by the people than ever before, that 
even poor parents left their children in school for a longer period and sent them more 
regularly than formerly. He very strongly recommends the establishment of a high 
school, from the fact that many pupils were sent to other cities to receive additional 
training after they had passed through the public schools of Belleville. 
In 1883~84, through the prevalence of sickness during the latter part of the winter 
and the earlier weeks of spring, attendance was diminished for a time, though on the 
whole it was better in all schools than the year before. 
Bloomington, for 188283, reported that, notwithstanding a decrease of 1,149 in 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  62. REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  school population, there was an increase of 47 in enrolment and of 34 in verage 
attendance. The schools, which were graded, were taught 175 days by 2 more teachers. 
By action of the board of education, the training department was suspended for a year at least, the board deciding to employ only experienced teachers. 
In 1#83~84, the schools were taught 176 days, in 58 rooms, with 2,800 sittings. The 
estimated value of 10 buildings, with sites, &c., was $242,907, 
Chicago reported for 1882~83 an increase of 3,895 in the public school enrolment, an 
additional average daily membership of 4,867, and additional average daily avtend- 
ance of 4,552. There were also 2,555 more enrolled in the evening schools, the attend- 
ance being large in the beginning, but rapidly falling off, so-that out of a total of 
6,956 the average attendance was only 1,862, and in view of the slim attendance the 
supeiintendent recommended that the evening high school be discontinued, The 
evening school for newsboys was still taught at the Newsboys’ Home; enrolment, 80, 
with 40 in average attendance. Much attention was given to the study of German 
in the day schools, the average membership of grammar pupils pursuing the study 
being 5,106, or nearly half of the pupils in such schools; but of music and drawing 
the success was much less decided. Manual training for boys in the high school was 
under consideration. There were in process of erection 6 new school buildings, with 
a seating capacity of 5,730, to cost, with heating apparatus, &c., $341,706, 
Statistics for 1883~84 up to July 3show considerable increase, but were not at that 
date complete, and no others have been received. 
Danville in its report for 1884 shows 74.74 per cent. of pupils in the primary grades, 
21.64 per cent. in grammar grades, and only 3.62 per cent. in high school grades. 
Almost three-fourths being thus in the first 4 years of the school course, the rise 
    tendent recommends that more adequate provision for this large class of pupils be 
made, especially in furnishing them fuller seating room and more teachers. * He rightly 
holds that, on an average, not more than 40 pupils should be assigned to one teacher, 
and that both the health and the educational interests of the pupils would be con- 
served by adopting this rule, even if the school term should have to be shortened to 
carry it out. 
Decatur made no report for 1882~83. A very brief one for 1883~84 shows a some- 
what smaller number of school youth than in 1881~82, a larger enrolment and aver- 
age attendance, 9 more teachers, and an expenditure for its public schools $4,045 
greater. Estimated enrolment in private and church schools, 300. : 
Elgin for 188203 and 1883~’84 presents a considerable increase in school population 
and enrolment, while attendance in private and parochial schools decreased. The 
schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught 188 days, with 1 more 
teacher. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 664. Valuation of public school 
property in 1884, $88,250, against $40,500 in the preceding year. 
Freeport in 1883-84 shows a decline of 207 in enrolment and of 175 in average attend- 
ance from what it reported in 1881~82, though the expenditure for school purposes 
was $2,291 greater than in that year. The estimated enrolment in private and parish 
schools was also 160 less, without any diminution in the reported number of children 
of school age. 
Galesburg from 1882~83 to 1883~84 increased its school youth by 231, its enrolment 
by 64, and its average attendance by 105, with an additional expenditure of $603. 
The enrolment in other than public schools is not given. 
Joliet for 1883-84 reported 19 rooms in 10 school buildings, with a seating capacity 
of 2,359. Schools were taught 198 days by 51 teachers; private and church schools 
enrolled 600, with an average daily attendance of 200. Estimated value of public 
school property, $137,300. . 1 
Moline gives but little information as to its schools beyond what may be found in 
the preceding table, except that there were 2 night schools, with 2 teachers in 1883 
and 3 in 1884, with an enrolment in the former year of 107; in the latter, of 149; that 
a large nuuiber of the day pupils had been neither absent nor tardy; that an exhibit 
of pupils’ industrial work had excited much enthusiasm; and that movements were i 
progress looking toward improvement in various directions, 
A return from Ottawa for 1883~84 gives 7 school buildings, in which were 30 rooms, 
with 1,600 sittings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $60,130. The schools were classed 
as primary and grammar and were taught 197 days. There was no city high school, 
but one under controi of the township trustees, not connected with the city district, 
was available for higher studies than those of the grammar grades. Estimated enrol- 
ment in private schools, 281. { 
Peoria for 1882~’83 reported 12 school buildings, containing 72 rooms, all in good 
condition. The schools were classed as primary, grammar, and high, with one even- 
ing school. Provision was made for the erection of one new building, which was 
much needed, as some of the schools were greatly overcrowded. No report was re- 
ceived for 188182, but since 188081 the school population had increased 2,287, enrol- 
ment 1,057, and average attendance was somewhat higher. At the opening of the 
school year music was made optional in the primary and grammar schools, and is said   
-P-A-G-E-335

to have made discipline easier and to have added much to the happiness of the school 
room. 
Statistics of 188384 show a loss in school youth, but gains in all other respects. 
Quincy preseuts in 1882~83 no increase in youth of school age, one of only 43 in 
public school enrolment, and a falling off of 28 in average attendance. Whether this 
check to the preceding growth came from the agitation noticed in the report for the 
prececing year as to the admission of colored pupils in common with whites does not 
appear, as no printed report has been received. 
Rockford, besides its public schools, with 66 rooms for study and recitation and 9 
for recitation only, reports for 1883 8 private or parochial schools, with an estimated 
enrolment of 500 pupils. There is no report at hand for 1883-84. 
Springfield for 1882~83 reported a decrease of 102 in enrolment in public schools, 
but 95 more in average attendance, the decline in enrolment being probably due to 
the fact that the schools had been in 1881~82 greatly overcrowded, many children 
being altogether excluded from school privileges. There were 2 new buildings 
erected during the year and the old ones were extensively repaired, yet one more was 
needed to meet the pressing demand for more room. The schools were graded as pri- 
mets grammar, and high, with a teachers’ training class for graduates of the high 
school, 
The additional building needed was erected and ready for the reception of pupils 
at the opening of the school year 188384, and 2 large rooms were added to another 
school-house. Other school property was extensively repaired,.and accommodations 
for pupils were thus both more numerous and more complete. A course of study for 
the teachers in the city schools was adopted, as well as revised courses for the high 
and disirict schools, 
KINDERGARTEN. *

- PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
No teacher is authorized to teach a common school in Illinois who is not of good 
moral character and who does not possess a certificate of qualification from the State 
superintendent of public instruction, from a county superintendent, or from the 
board of education of an incorporated village or city in which he desires to teach.! 
County superintendents’ certificates are of 2 grades, the first, for a year, covering the 
ordinary English branches and the second, for 2 years, adding the elements of natural 
sciences, physiology, and the laws of health. These are valid only in the county 
where they are given; those from city boards are valid in the city that has issued 
them; those from the State superintendent, unless revoked for cause, are valid for 
life in any county or school district of the State. 
STATE, COUNTY, AND CITY SCHOOLS FOR NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Illinois State Normal University, Normal, and the Southern Illinois Normal Univer- 
sity, Carbondale, both under State control, continued in 1833~84 to prepare teachers 
for the public schools. The first mentioned, with 15 regular instructors and 128 pupil 
teachers, had 488 normal students in its 3-year course, 1 graduate student, and 350 in 
the model school, which contains primary, intermediate, grammar, and high school 
grades; total for the school year, deducting 60 counted twice, 779. The scientific de- 
partment for special students was continued, The second reported for the same 
period 14 regular instructors and 39 pupil teachers, with 540 students in the normal 
and training schools, including 9 graduates, 4 special students, and 37 attending 
- special session. For admission to either school pupils must pledge themselves to 
teach in the public schools of the State 3 years after graduating. Course of study at 
Southern Illinois, 3 and 4 years. Both schools continued their summer institutes. 
The objects of both these schools, as expressed in the legislative acts for the estab- 
lishment of them, are ‘‘ to qualify teachers for the common schools of this State, by 
imparting instruction in the art of teaching and all branches of stady which pertain 
to a common school education, in the elements of the natural sviences, in the funda- 
mental laws of the United States and of the State of Illinois in regard to the rights 
and duties of citizens, and in such other studies as the board of education may from 
time to time prescribe.” 
The Cook County Normal School has essentially the same aims as the two State schools, 
but with more especial reference to the thorough preparation of teachers for that pop- 
ulous county, and probably also for the schools of Chicago, as the city training school 
does not seem to have been resumed. In its normal school department, of 4 classes,   
1Graduates of county normal schools may, by the action of the county board of education in which 
such a school is situated, be granted first class county certificates on their diplomas of graduation.

  were 334 pupils in 1883~-’84, 103 of them in the professional training class, which sup- poses a preceding 4-year course in a first class high school, college, or normal school, 
or an equivalent preparation. In its public school and Kindergarten classes and Kin- dergarten training class there wore 447 more, making a total attendance of 781, under 16 instructors, 
At Springfield, graduates from the city high school are encouraged to enter a teachers’ 
training class, which passes its members through 2 years of preparation for work in 
the city schools. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING, 
An interesting school that gives this training is the normal class for training Kin- 
dergarten teachers which is under the auspices of the Chicago Free Kindergarten 
Association and which evidently aims at real thoroughness. A good common school 
education is an imperative requirement for admission to the class, and ladies that have 
completed a thorough high school, collegiate, or university course are especially de- 
sired. The association has done excellent work in gathering the children of the poor 
from the most unwholesome and dangerous surroundings, bringing them into bright 
and cheery rooms, and giving them 3 hours of instruction daily in attractive Kinder- 
garten exercises under christian teachers of intelligence and culture. It aims to ex- 
tend this good work by training teachers for it under a special teacher of experience 
and high repute. The normal class conducted by this teacher, at the date of the last 
report, in 1884, had 60 lady pupils. 
A school kindred to this in aims and methods, called the Danville Normal Kinder- 
garten Training School, is carried on in connection with the church and school work 
of Holy Trinity Parish (Protestant Episcopal), Danville. 
For the statistics of normal schools under other than State and city direction, see 
Table ILI, Part 2, of the appendix; for a summary of their statistics, see a corre- 
sponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The institutes held by county superintendents for improvement of teachers in 1883 
numbered 167; days of continuance of these, 1,114;1 held by other persons, 45; days 
of continuance, 236; different teachers attending all these, 6,877;? number held in 
1884, not given; days of continuance, 1,345; teachers attending, 11,406; expenditure 
for the former year, $13,505; for the latter year, $22,559. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
Illinois has been fruitful in publications of this class, 9 being issued in 1882~’83 and 
1883~84. These were, from Chicago offices (1), Iapi Oaye, or The Word Carrier (pub- 
lished monthly for the educational agencies of Congregational and Presbyterian mis- 
sions in Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, and elsewhere), which was in its twelfth volume 
in 1883, presented one number as volume XIII in January, 1884, and began volume [ of 
a new series in March, 1884; (2) The Practical Teacher, a monthly which closed its 
sixth volume in June, 1883, and in July, 1884, published one number as volume VII, 
which announced that from September following it would be edited by Col. Francis 
W. Parker, of the Cook County Normal School; (3) The Present Age, monthly, in its 
second and third volumes in these two years; (4) The School Herald, bimonthly, which 
entered on its third volume January 15, 1€83, and apparently ceased its issues April 
15 of that year; (5) The Schoolmaster, bimonthly, which in the midst of its fourth 
volume, June 1, 1884, appeared in enlarged form as Intelligence and The Schoolmaster ; 
(6) The Western Educational Journal, monthly, which entered its fifth volume Jan- 
uary, 1884, and seems to have ceased with its fifth number in May of that year; (7) 
The New Method, monthly, beginning its first volume January, 184. 
From other than Chicago offices have come the Illinois Schoo] Journal, monthly, 
published at Normal, in its second and third volumes in the two years above men- 
tioned, and the Normal Mirror, quarterly, published at Danville, mainly in the inter- 
est of the East Illinois College and Normal School. This last journal reached the 
third number of its second volume in April, 1884. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
These schools are recognized parts of the State system and 164 of them appear in 
the State report for 1884, an increase of 20 since 1882. Of these, 41 were in districts 
under special laws; 41 others in incorporated cities and villages, under section 80 of 
the school law, which allows such corporations to ‘‘establish schools of different 
grades and make regulations for the admission of pupils into the same ;” 6 were town-

ship high schools, which, by section 50, are permitted to be established by vote of the ~ 
people; 1, a township high school! under special law; 75, high schools in districts 
with boards of directors under the general school law. Only 12 of all these were in 
separate buildings, namely, the main high school at Chicago and its 2 branch schools + 
and 1 each at Bloomington, Evanston, Jefferson, Lake View, Moline, Ottawa, Peoria, 
Princeton, and Streator. The value of school furniture, sites, and buildings of these 
12 was estimated to be $626.400 ; that of their libraries and school apparatus, $69,938, 
the libraries containing 32,210 volumes. Ninety schools reported courses of 3 
years ; 1, a course of between 3 and 4 years; 5, courses of 3 or 4 years; 67, courses of 
4 years; 1, a3 or 5 year course; and I (at Princeton) a 5-year course alone. These 
schools had from 5 to 10 months of annual session, enrolled 12,405 pupils, and were 
taught by 430 teachers, whose pay was from $25 to $300 a month. The graduates of 
1884 numbered 1,177. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic or preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables LV, VI, VII, IX, and X 
of appendix. Forsummaries of statistics of each class, see corresponding tables in 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Ilinois Industrial University, Urbana, open to both sexes, continues to present 
in its college of literature and science the Latin, Greek, English, French, and German 
studies noticed in preceding years. In the prosecution of these studies there is a 
choice between a school of English and modern languages and a school of ancient lan- 
guages and literature, each covering 4 years. In the former, the aim is to afford a 
thorough training in the best elements of English and American literature, with spe- 
cial study of choice authors and with a fair introduction to French and German as 
well as Anglo-Saxon, mathematics, natural sciences, political economy, &c., the Latin 
of Cicero, Livy, and Horace being optional in the first year. In the latter school, the 
study of Greck and Latin is pursued with special reference to the reflex influence of 
these languages on the student’s mastery of English, as well as with reference to his 
clear acquaintance with both the history and the literature of Greece and Rome. ° 
Thirty-three accredited high schools prepare for the studies of these 2 collegiate 
schools, as well as for the scientific schools to be noticed further on. Graduates of 
the school of English and modern literature receive from the university the degree of 
bachelor of letters; graduates of the school of ancient languages and literature, the 
degree of a. B. Higher degrees must be prepared for by at least a year of prescribed 
graduate siudy, the only alternative for this being three years of success in a profes- 
.8ion. All able bodied male students in preparatory studies or in those df the first 3 
collegiate years receive instruction in military drill and discipline, and for any of 
either sex that desire it there is offered training in industrial art and in music. For 
information as to the colleges of agriculture, engineering, and natural science which 
form parts of the university, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, further on. 
Of the 28 other collegiate schools reported in former years, Rock River University 
appears to have suspended. Another, St. Francis Solanus College, Quincy, has been 
admitted to the collegiate table in its place, but with some question as to its full col- 
legiate standing; a like question has again arisen as to Irvington College, Irvington, 
readmitted some years ago, but in 1884 showing apparently no collegiate students. A 
German-English College, Galena, has also come in, with fair evidence of good collegi- 
ate arrangements, making 29. 
Of the colleges reporting, 7 indicate the reception of special donations to the amount 
of $176,769 for endowment, buildings, and current needs in 1882~83 ; and in 1883~84, 
for like purposes, 10 report receipts of $125,442. 
For the statistics of those now on the Bureau list, see Table IX of the appendix ; for 
a summary of their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For the statistics of 12 institutions of this class in 1882~’83, see Table VIII of the 
appendix; for a summary, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
receding. Most of them have fair collegiate arrangements; 2, Almira College and 
forbs Seminary, are presided over by former State superintendents of instruction. 
The State Industrial University and 23 of the denominational or non-sectarian col- 
leges open their doors to young women as well as to young men, and 4 have special 
courses for them.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC. 
In this branch the colleges of agriculture, engineering, and natural science in the 
Illinois Industrial University claim special notice. Each of them, in common with 
the before mentioned college of literature and science, has a 4-year course. The col- 
lege of agriculture, with 5 professors, aims to educate scientific agriculturists and 
horticulturists, not only in the work of the farm and garden, but also in veterinary 
science, pomology, entomology, botany, and the chemistry of agriculture. That of 
engineering, with 6 professors, prepares students in the mathematical basis of all such 
work, and goes on into physics, mechanic art and design, and the principles of mech- 
anism in bridge work, stone work, mining engineering, architecture, and related 
studies. That of natural science, with 6 professors, aims to impart such a knowledge 
of chemistry and its manipulations as will fit students for the business of the druggist, 
the pharmacist, or the chemist. The laboratory facilities in these lines are believed 
to be equal to any in the West and far superior to those of the ordinary colleges. 
Students in all the schools of the university in 1883-84, 330, of whom 261 were young 
men and 69 young women. Of the young men, 3 were resident graduates, 175 collegi- 
ate students, 7 special, and 76 preparatory. Of the young women, 54 were in colle- 
giate studies of apparently limited range, 6 in special studies, and 9 in preparatory. 
Of the 29 other colleges for young men or for both sexes, 25 show arrangements for 
some scientific training, but most of them with little approximation to the thorough 
arrangements of the university. 
The University of Chicago, in its well equipped Dearborn Observatory, continued to 
offer instruction in seronorny both to regular and special students. Several of its 
Fapaantes are said to have taken high rank as astronomical observers and surveyors. 
‘he museum, herbarium, and chemical and philosophical apparatus of this university 
soppes to be especially good and complete. 
+ St. Viateur’s College, Bourbonnais Grove, and at Westfield College, Westfield, in- 
struction in telegraphy is offered. At Chaddock College, Quincy, this instruction 
seems to have ceased in 1833. 
The Chicago Manual Training School,! noted in the report for 1882 as projected, was 
incorporated April 11, 1883; the corner stone of a building for it was laid September 
24 of that year, and by February 4, 1884, the school exercises were begun in this 
building, with 72 pupils, selected by examination from 130 applicants. Two of those 
first admitted were compelled to withdraw from lack of strength for the school work, 
but their places were immediately filled and the number kept up to 72, The course 
of instruction covers 3 years in mathematics, physics, mechanics, free hand, mechan- 
ical, and geometrical drawing, and shop work in various forms, such as carpentry, wood, 
carving and turning, care and use of tools, study of machinery, and management o: 
steam engines and boilers. An hour a day is given to drawing, 2 hours a day to shop 
work, the remainder to study and recitation. Pupils must be at least 14 years of age 
and must pass a satisfactory examination in arithmetical and other English studies to 
secure an entrance. Being admitted, they furnish their own books, drawing instru- 
ments and material, with aprons, overalls, and pocket tools; shop tools and mate- 
rials are provided by the school ; officers of instruction and government, 4 in 1883-84, 
The Industrial School, Sugar Grove, Kane County, where ordinary school studies 
are supplemented by instruction in scientific agriculture and horticulture, was con- 
tinued in 1883~’84 and reported to be always full. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology was taught in 1882~83 and 1883-84 in 22 collegiate or ecclesiastical insti- 
tutions for instruction inthis State. Three were Baptist, the theological departments 
of Ewing and Shurtleff Colleges, Ewing and Upper Alton, and the Baptist Union 
Theological Seminary, Morgan Park; 2, the Bible departments of Abingdon College, 
Abingdon, and of Eureka College, Eureka, were Christian; 1, the Chicago Theologi- 
cal Seminary, was Congregational; 1, the Union Biblical Institute of Northwestern 
College, Naperville, was evangeli¢al; 5, a German theological class at Carthage Col- 
lege, the Swedish American Ansgari College, Knoxville, Wartburg Theological Semi- 
nary, Mendota, Augustana Theological Seminary, Rock Island, and Concordia Col- 
i lege Preachers’ Seminary, Springfield, were Lutheran ; 3, the Garrett Biblical Institute 
of Northwestern University, Evanston, and the theological departments of the Ger- 
man-English College, Galena, and McKendree College, Lebanon, were Methodist 
Episcopal; 2, the theological department of Blackburn University, Carlinville, and 
the Presbyterian Seminary of the Northwest, Chicago, were Presbyterian; 1, the 
Western Theological Seminary, Chicago, was Protestant Episcopal ; 2, the theologi- 
cal department of St. Viateur’s College, Bourbonnais Grove, and St. Joseph’s He-

clesiastical College, Teutopolis, were Roman Catholic ; 1, the theological department 
of Lombard University, Galesburg, was Universalist ; and 1, the theological depart- 
ment of Wheaton College, Wheaton, was Wesleyan. 
Two theological departments formerly reported —those of Illinois Wesleyan Univer- 
sity, Bloomington (Methodist Episcopal), and Lincoln University, Lincoln—appear 
to have been suspended, while Jubilee College (Protestant Episcopal), long suspended 
‘from lack of funds, stilf continues to be. ; 
Most of those indicated as in operation had 3-year courses, meant to follow high 
school or collegiate training, but in the German theological class of Carthage College 
the course appears to be of one year; at McKendree College, the same; at Eureka Col- 
lege, Shurtletf College, and Augustana Theological Seminary, 2 years, 
Law was expounded by the faculty of the Bloomington College of Law of Illinois 
Wesleyan University; of the Union College of Law of the Northwestern University, 
Evanston, and University of Chicago; aud in the law departments of McKendree 
College, Lebanon, and Chaddock College, Quincy, all with 2-year courses of sub- 
stantially 36 weeks yearly. The first and third show no preliminary preparation; at 
the other 2 a good English education is expected. 
For statistics of the schools of theology and law that report, see Tables XI and XII 
of the appendix; for a summary of these statistics, corresponding tables in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
Medical practice was prepared for in 5regular, 1 eclectic, and 2 homeopathic schools, 
all at Chicago, except the Quincy College of Medicine, a department of Chaddock Col- 
lege, Quincy. All 8 required the customary 3 years of study under a preceptor, with 
attendance on at least 2 courses of systematic lecture instruction of 21 to 31 weeks 
each, the lowest number of weeks being at the Rush Medical College and the highest 
at the Woman’s Medical College, both “ regular,” while the Chicago Medical College 
(of Northwestern University) and the Chicago College of Physicians and Surgeons 
each had 24 weeks of annual session, and the Quincy ‘ollege of Medicine 22 weeks. A 
preliminary English education. is expected in this last and is made tolerably sure of in 
the others by an examination of all candidates for admission that are not graduates 
of a college, academy, or high school, 
The Leclectic schoolis the Bennett College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery, which 
has annual sessions of 24 weeks each and requires either a preliminary examination 
of candidates for entrance or other evidence of a good English education. 
The 2 hommopathic schools are the Hahnemann Medical College, with 24 weeks’ 
annual session, and the Chicago Homeopathic Medical College, with 22 weeks, both 
apgening evidence of good English education. 
school of midwifery, organized in 1880, also appears at Chicago, with an annual 
course of lectures of 24 weeks’ duration. For admission, candidates must pass an 
examination and give references as to moral character; for graduation, must be 21 
ears of age and have attended one full lecture term. License to practise in the 
State must come from the board of health, 
Pharmacy.—At the Chicago College of Pharmacy, instruction in chemistry, in the 
qualities and operation of medicines, and in the pharmaceutical preparation of them 
was given, as in previous years, the students of 1882~3 numbering 158, of whom 27 
graduated from the 2-year course of 5 months each year. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Illinois Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Jacksonville, founded in 1839, pro- 
vides instruction and furnishes board and books free of charge to youth 10-21 years 
of age who are proper subjects for its care. The pupils are taught the rudiments 
of an English education, with printing, cabinet making, shoemaking, wood turning, 
gardening, baking, cookery, and making confectionery, the method of instruction 
being oral and manual combined. The institution owns 46 acres of land, valued, 
with buildings, &c., at $400,000 in 1882~83 and $423,000 in 188384. It received 
$96,000 from the State in each of these years, and, with 29 teachers, gave instruction 
to 575 pupils in the former year and 522 in the latter, of which numbers a minority 
were females. A library of about 6,000 volumes aids and broadens the instruction 
iven, 
e The Chicago Deaf-Mute Day Schools, controlled by the board of education of the city 
of Chicago, taught the common English branches, with the addition of morals and 
manners, oral and manual methods being employed. No industries were taught. 
Expenditure for the 5 deaf-mute schools for the year, $4,262. Instructors, 6, includ- 
ing the principal; pupils, 55 in 1883; in 1884, the same number of instructors, with 
52 pupils.

sufficiently indicates its aim. Elementary English studies are pursued, with special 
attention to development of the power of articulate speech and lip reading. 
TRAINING OF THE BLIND. 
The Illinois Institution for the Education of the Blind, Jacksonville, had for 1882~83 
a total attendance of 157 pupils, from 71 counties, under 14 resident instructors. 
School studies embraced the common English branches, with literature, vocal and 
instrumental music; the industries, fancy and bead work, broom and mattress mak- 
ing, and cane seating. The institution belongs to the State and is valued, with 
grounds, &c., at $116,427. 
In 1883~84 the attendance was 168, from 75 counties, and the teachers numbered 
16, 1 having resigned and 3 new ones having been employed. In the former of these 
2 years 7 pupils completed the course of instruction and were graduated; in the lat- 
ter the graduates were only 3. 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Illinois State Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, Lincoln, organized in 1865, has 
for its object the moral, intellectual, and physical culture of this class of children. 
They are graded into 11 classes. The rudiments of a common school education are 
‘iven, with lessons in art and drawing, sewing, singing, calisthenics, and housework 
‘or such as are capable. There is a well furnished gymnasium, where all are sent at 
some hour of the day for appropriate exercise. In 1¢83~84 a Kindergarten class was 
formed, and very satisfactory results are said to have come from it. The total at- 
tendance in all classes for 1882~’83 was 481; for 188384, 431. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Illinois Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home, Normal, a State institution, reports to the State 
superintendent an enrolment of 309 pupils for 1882~83, with an average attendance 
of 291; for 1883~’84, an enrolment of 330, with 325 in average attendance. The pupils 
enter at 5 years of age and leave at 14. The school training is of 9 grades, each grade 
covering a year. There are monthly examinations and monthly reports to parents 
or guardians. An excellent library of 2,076 volumes aids the school instruction, the 
hitdren being admitted to the library every evening and on Sunday afternoons. The 
larger boys assist in farm work and the larger girls sew an hour each ovening after 
school. Regular sewing classes are organized and a teacher is employed to make the 
work effective. 
For statistics of other homes for orphans, see Table XXII of the appendix; fora 
summary of their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING, 
The Illinois State Reform School, Pontiac, receives boys sentenced by the courts 
of Illinois for offences against the laws, trains them in school studies 4 hours a day 
and occupies them in daily work 6 hours, giving no time to recreation. The shortest 
sentence is for a year; the longest, for 5 years, good conduct diminishing the time 
considerably. At the expiration of their sentence, thus possibly shortened, they are 
sent to their homes or such other places as may be determined on, the State paying 
their way and giving them $5 to begin life upon anew. For the 14 years during which 
the school has been in operation it has received up to the close of 1883~84 a total of 
1,483 boys. Of that number 1,182 had been discharged, leaving 301 confined. A large 
roportion of those received are found to be illiterate or very slightly taught. Of 290 
Ges received since 1882, 45 could not read, 129 could not write, the same number had 
never studied arithmetic, and 241 had studied neither geography nor grammar. But 
in the school many learn rapidly, 239 of those latterly discharged being well up in 
ordinary school studies, while, of 257, 69 were in language lessons, 26 in grammar, 
100 in patra States history, 11 in book-keeping, 20 in physiology, and 31 in natural 
hhilosophy. 
z The Buse Industrial School, Chicago, opened in 1867, receives poor children 6 to 12 
years of age, of either sex, on the basis of a Burr endowment fund, and trains the 
girls in sewing and school studies and the boys in reading, spelling, writing, and arith- 
metic. Of the former, there were 63 taught in 1883-84; of the latter, 51. 
St. Mary’s Training School, Des Plaines, Cook County, aims to aid in the education 
and industrial training of destitute and wayward boys, receiving tuition fees from 
such as can afford it and furnishing instruction gratuitously to those who cannot pay. 
Instructors in 188384, 6, with 3 foremen in it shops; pupils, 200, all in English 
studies, with adjunct shop work, according to circumstances. 
The Illinois Industrial School for Girls, Evanston, is a private corporation, organ- 
ized in 1877, and has for its object the moral, intellectual, and industrial training of 
neglected and homeless girls until 18 years of age or until permanent homes and 
means of support can be secured for them, Statistics for 1883 and 1884 are wanting.

ILLINOIS. 69 
The Girls’ Industrial School of the Yomen’s Christian Home Mission, Peoria, furnishes 
instruction in sewing and encourages industry and skill giving every properly 
made garment to the maker. Moral iruths and habits of neatness are inculeated and 
ry effort is made to train the girls to habits of diligence and perseverance, hoping 
thereby to make them good and useful women, The attendance averages about 150 
annually, the age of those admitted being from 5 to 14, Since its organization in 
1875 up to the close of 1883~84 the school has admitted about 2,700 girls from humble 
Homes esd trained them in knitting, sewing, dressmaking, and fancy work. Teachers 
in 1e04, 22. 
For other schools of this class, see Table XXII, Part 3, of appendix. 
     
TRAINING OF NURSES, 
The Ilinois Training School for Nurses, organized in 1881, and connected with Cook 
County Hospital, Chicago, had 36 pupil nurses and 2 probationers in 1882~83, of 
which number 7 were graduated. The number of patients cared for during the year 
was, in the training school wards, 4,307; private patients, 23. The pupils had in 
charge 7 hospital wards and were receiving a 2-year course of instruction in anatomy, 
physiology, materia medica, therapeutics, obstetrics, and surgery. In 1883~84 the 
pupil nurses numbered 42, making 57 from the beginning; graduates of the year, 14. 
TRAINING IN LANGUAGES. 
  The Western Snmmer School of Languages, under the auspices of Mr. Henry Cohn, 
is supposed to have been held at Evanston, as in former years; but no distinct infox- 
mation respecting it has been received. 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
This is believed to have been continued in the Chicago Academy of Fine Aris and 
the Chicago Academy of Design, and is known to have been continued in the School 
of Art and Design connected with the Ilinois Industrial University, Urbana, where 
there is a 2-year course for ordinary students and advanced courses of less definite 
length for such as wish to become accomplished designers, painters, or teachers of art. 
Several other colleges for young men or for both sexes have also schools of art, as 
have those for superior instruction of young women. 
TRAINING IN MUSIC. 
Instruction of this kind is reported to be given at the Chicago Musical College, at 
the National Normal Music School, in the same city, and at a School of Music, Eureka. 
In many of the literary colleges there are also either schools of musi¢ or arrangements 
for giving such instruction. The Illinois Industrial University, though it does not 
make music a part of its course, provides competent teachers of it for matriculates 
that seek a musical training, giving tuition in 10-week terms, 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
ILLINOIS SOCIETY OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS. 
This society held its session of 1883, July 11-13, and discussed the subjects of ‘Dis- 
cipline in public schools,” ‘The teacher in graded schools,” ‘Supplementary read- 
ing,” and ‘‘History in public schools;” and Dr. Scouller, superintendent of the Re- 
form School, Pontiac, presented a paper on ‘‘ How to manage bad boys.” 
CHICAGO INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION. 
In 1882~83 this body had at its monthly meetings discussions and readings by Su- 
perintendent Howland; E.J. James, of Normal; C. M. Woodward, of St. Louis; Alex- 
ander Forbes, and others, on such topics as ‘‘German universities,” “ The essentials 
of education,” ‘The objects of discipline,” ‘‘ Influence of the novel on modern life,” 
“ Teachers in a graded system,” ‘“ What ought we to expect of the public schools?” 
«“ Hygiene of school life,” &c. 
In [883~84 Superintendent Howland, J. D. Scouller, State Superintendent Raab, 
and C. G. Stowell presented addresses and papers on “ Elements of growth in school 
life,” ‘‘Management of bad boys,” ‘Educational theories of the Ancient Romans,” 
and ‘Ethics of liberal culture.” How these were treated does not appear, but the 
titles indicate that thought and pains had been devoted to important themes which 
might well have larger audiences. 
ILLINOIS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its thirtieth annual session, December 26-28, 1883, at Spring- 
field, State Superintendent Raab presiding. The only accounts of it received have 
been scanty and imperfect. Some of the subjects presented for discussion the first 
day were “Course of study,” ‘School visitation,” and ‘Institute plans for 1884,” 
   
-P-A-G-E-342
  10 REPORT OF -THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
@ committee being appointed to draft an outline for the institute work of that year. 
Addresses were delivered in the evening by Governor Hamilton and John Eaton, United 
States Commissioner of Education. The subjects for the second day were ‘The dis- 
trict school,” ‘‘ Training school work,” ‘‘Illustrative teaching,” ‘Object teaching.” 
“Science in the schools,” “Is Greek a fetich?” A most interesting discussion fol- 
lowed the reading of these papers. President Raab gave an address in the evening, 
in which he reviewed the educational work of the year, with brief reference to the 
outlook. The speaker hoped that he would yet have the privilege of voting for a 
constitutional amendment which would at the close of a certain period exclude from 
the suffrage all who cannot read and write the: English language. The body of tho 
address on “‘ Imagination in education” gave excellent satisfaction. The snbjects of 
“Manual training” and ‘New education” occupied the morning session of the third 
day, and among the closing exercises in the afternoon was Dr. Scouller’s address on 
the “ Management of bad boys,” which was well received.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics reported for 1882~83 and 1883-84 present a pleasin record of increase 
during the year in nearly all the items which indicate effective tical work, and yet 
against an increase of 3,816 in school population appears one of only 473 in enrolment, 
leaving over 30 per cent. of the youth of school age not in the public schools. The at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
    12 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
tendance in private and parochial schools, were the statistics at hand, would of course 
show a somewhat higher percentage of school attendance throughout the State. 
The increase of 9,525 in average daily attendance over 1882~83 and tho holding in 
such attendance of nearly 65 per cent. of the enrolment indicate really good work 
done, this large attendance being probably nearly, if not fully, up to the school ac- 
commodation. While there was a decrease of 80 in school-houses reported, there were 
340 built, a gain of 49 over the previous year, which in size and value probably more 
than made up for the above decrease (if it was a real decrease) in numbers, since the 
value of school property shows an advance of $506,183. e 
Then there were 45 more school districts reported, and 21 more in which schools were 
taught, ofiset, however, by 24 more without schools. In private schools taught in the 
public school buildings in the intervals of the regular sessions, and generally by the 
same teachers, there was an increase of 19, with 1,835 more enrolled and 3,347 more 
in average attendance; this item indicates a clear gain in the amount of educational 
work in the State, the public schools being in session only an average of 126 days in 
1884, As to teachers, the figures show an increasing preference for females (partly per- 
haps because they can be had for less pay), the white male teachers decreasing by 272, 
the white females increasing by 28. Both male and female colored teachers decreased 
2 each, showing a total decrease of 248 teachers, with a decrease of $3,500 in expen- 
diture. The State school fund, already one of the largest in the United States,! shows 
an increase of $67,417 during the year. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
This is by State and county boards of education; a State superintendent of public 
instruction, who is ex officio president of the State board; a county superintendent 
for each county; a school trustee for each township; 3 such trustees for each incor- 
porated town or city with less than 30,000 people; a director for each rural district $7 
~ and, in cities with 30,000 or more inhabitants, a school commissioner for each ward. 
The members of the State board include the governor of the State and 7 educational 
officers named by law. The State superintendent is elected by the people for 2 years; 
the county superintendents, by the assembled township trustees of each county, for a 
like term ; each township trustee, for 2 years, by the electors of his township ; other 
school trustees, by common councils in the smaller cities and by boards of trustees in 
incorporated towns, for terms of 3 years, with partial annual change where they form 
a board; the director, for a year, by the patrons of the rural school he is to care for. 
For colored children and youth separate schools are provided, with the same advan- 
tages as other schools of like grade! Any one attending these schools and deserving 
promotion to a grade not included in them is entitled to enter a white school of that 
grade, and no distinction therein may be made on account of race or color of the 
student. The trustees of two or more adjacent counties or townships may estab- 
lish a new district and build a school-house therein when in their judgment it may 
appear necessary. Trustees of two or more municipal corporations for school pur- 
poses may establish joint graded schools and provide for admission to them from the 
primary schools of their corporations. Such gradation is becoming extensive even in 
country districts, and a system of graduation from such schools at the conclusion of 
the course is now common. Teachers seeking employment must present a license to 
teach from the proper State, county, or city authority, for which, see Preparation and 
Qualifications of Teachers, further on. At the close of each term of school, teachers 
must make to the proper trustee, under oath, a full report of the required data, one- 
fourth of their wages being held until such report is filed. German may be taught at 
the request of the parents or guardians of 25 or more children attending a public 
school and the Bible may not be excluded from the public schools. A school term 
is of 60 days; a school month, of 20; and aschool week, of 5days. The public schools 
are free to all unmarried youth of school age (6 to 21) as ascertained by an annual 
census. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The means of support for public schools on the part of the State come from the 
income of a common school fund of nearly $9,340,000, which, with the proceeds of a 
State tax of 16 cents on $100, of 50 cents on each taxable poll, of a congressional 
township fund, and of the tax for liquor licenses, goes for tuition only, without de- 
duction for expenses of collection and disbursement. For constructing, renting, or 
repairing school-houses, for providing furniture, apparatus, and fuel for these houses, 
and for meeting all the other necessary expenses of ¢the schools, except tuition, the 
trustees of townships, towns, or cities may levy a special tax, not to exceed 50 cents   
1 Missouri and Illinois exceed it in amount reported, but may not include the same elements. — 
?The rural school districts here are an aggregation of persons or families that choose or agree to send their children to a certain school. They are not, as in most States, limited by defined lines, but 
cover whatever territory the paprans reside in, resembling very nearly the school communities that 
have for several years existed by law in Texas.
-P-A-G-E-345
  INDIANA, 73 
m each $100 of property and $1 on each poll in any year. For other school purposes, 
trustees of civil townships, of incorporated towns, and common councils of cities may 
levy annually a tax not to exceed 25 cents on $100 and $1 on each poll; while larger 
cities may levy also 25 cents on $100 for grounds, school-houses, and supplies for these, 
and the same amount for paying teachers, with one-fifth of a mill for school libraries, 
In smaller cities and incorporated towns a tax of one-third of a mill annually for a free 
public library in each is authorized. Special additional taxes for payment of school 
debts are likewise provided for. ' 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Amendments to the school law, which took effect June 10, 1883, created two new 
grades of county teachers’ licenses, one of them for 3 years and one for 8 years; mado 
the former one of 6 months a trial license, not renewable; authorized superintendents 
to consider special fitness of applicants for work in city and town schools and took 
away the power of renewing licenses without examination ; provided for an institute 
fund of $20,000 annually from the State; and changed the time for trustees’ reports 
from September and October to the first Monday in August. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
In cities with less than 30,000 inhabitants 3 school trustees, elected by the common 
council of each city for 3-year terms, with annual change of one, manage the schools, 
erect the buildings forthem, appoint the teachers, grade the pupils, and make annual 
reports of receipts and expenditures to the county commissioners and of all statistics 
to the county superintendent; since 1883, such reports have been due on the first Mon- 
day in August for the school year ending July 31. 
In cities with 30,000 or more inhabitants the electors of each school district, since 
1871, elect a school commissioner to represent their interests in the city board, which 
is authorized to levy taxes for teachers, buildings, and libraries. - 
Both classes of cities may choose superintendents for their schools,

‘fallen off 208. The number of teachers was 6 greater, 1 of them teaching music. In 
private and parochial schools there was a reported enrolment of 1,930, more than a 
third of the number reported as enrolled in the city schools. 
Fort Waynein 1882-83 had 9 school buildings, with 4,130 sittings, providing for only 
29 per cent. of the school population; adding 3,400 enrolled in private and parochial 
schools, only 55 per cent. had school accommodations. Public school property was 
valued at $234,000. While there wasa slight increase in ee poe aeons enrolment, 
average daily attendance, and teachers, there was a decrease from 1881-82 of $11,447 
in expenditures. Of the 3,400 in private and parochial schools, 2,350 were in average 
daily attendance, occupying 17 buildings. The public schools were in session 195 
days. Special teachers in music, drawing, and penmanship were employed, and the 
work in these branches was said by the editor of the Indiana School Journal to be 
exceptionally good. 
_ in 188334, with an increase of 235 in school youth, there was an increase of 224 
in enrolment in the city schools and of 190 in the average daily attendance in those 
schools, while in schools other than public there were 3,500 reported, an increase of 
100. 
Indianapolis in 1882~83 had 29 school buildings, with 12,837 sittings, valued, with 
other property, at $1,023,101, providing for only 39 per cent. of the school population. 
For the year there was an increase of 2,201 in school population, of 464 in enrolment, 
of 932 in average daily attendance, and of 39 in teachers, but a decrease of $10,378 in 
expenditures, The enrolment in public schools was only 42 per cent. of the school 
population; adding 2,833 in private and parochial schools shows only 50.24 per cent. 
of the children in school. 
In 1883-84, with the same number of school buildings and sittings and same valu- 
ation asthe year before, there was an increase of 1,940 in youth of school age, of 510 in 
enrolment, and of 11 in teachers, while there were 31 fewer in average daily attend- 
ance and $10,140 less were expended. There were 2,800 in private and parochial 
schools, which, with 14,295 enrolled in public schools, shows only 49 per cent. in 
school. Only 1 special teacher in drawing is reported. The city lost this year its 
excellent superintendent, Hon. H. 8. Tarbell, who had served it with great fidelity 
from 1878. He was succeeded by the assistant superintendent, Mr. Lewis H. Jones, 
Mr. Tarbell going to Providence, R. I. 
Besides the city schools proper there appear at Indianapolis 12 Kindergiirten in 
1883~84, one of them a training school for Kindergartners, 2 others free and meant for 
children gathered from the street, who are taught and fed. For statistics of all these, 
see Table V of the appendix. 
Jeffersonville in 1882~82 reported 5 school buildings, with 1,900 sittings, valued at 
$73,445, yet_providing for only 51.44 per cent. of the school popEiation of the place. 
With a small loss in youth of school age as compared with the preceding year, there 
was yet a Fain of 102 in enrolment, of 63 in average attendance daily, of 5 in 
teachers, and of $2,822 in expenditure for public Rael, Still, only 50 per cent. of 
the school population was enrolled, 72.15 per cent. of those that were enrolled being 
retained.in average daily attendance. ‘ 
La Fayette for 1882-83 presents no statistics, but in 1883~84 shows an increase in 
school youth of 940 since 188182. Yet, with this growth of material, only 61 more 
pupils were enrolled in city schools and only 86 more were in average attendance, un- 
der the same number of teachers, though $24,169 more had been expended for the 
schools, mainly for sites, buildings, furniture, apparatus, and library books. 
Logansport in 1882~’83 had 6,school buildings, with 1,784 sittings, valued, with other 
property, at $146,000 and providing for only 41 per cent. of the school population. 
ith slight change in statistics for the year, there were only 44 per cent. of the youth 
of school age enrolled ; yet, including 900 in private and parochial schools, 65 per cent. 
were in school, while 73.5 per cent. of the enrolment were in average daily attendance. 
One teacher in music was employed. 
For 1883~’84 no information has been received. ; 
Madison showed no increase of school buildings or rooms in 1882~83. With only 
68 more school youth than in 1881~82, it enrolled 167 more in its schools, but failed 
to hold more than 52 additional in average attendance. No evening schools are re- 
orted. In 3 private or church schools there was an estimated enrolment of 800. 
Bho school trustees, in a printed report, say that there has been improvement on the 
part of both teachers and pupils, with a most healthy and satisfactory condition gen- 
erally. There were 7 graduates in the year, of whom 6 were young women. Notwith- 
standing a large falling off of revenue the trustees were able to pay $2,000 of indebt- 
edness and yet keep the expenses entirely within the receipts. 
For 1883~84 there is no information. 
New Albany wakes no report for 188283, but in 188384 reports 48.25 per cent. of the 
school population enrolled in its public schools. Including 500 in private and paro- 
chial schools, only 56,11 per cent. were in school ; but 69.13 per cent. of the enrelled 
were in average daily attendance. School property was valued at $158,000.

Richmond presents no figures for 1882-83, but for 1883~84 shows an increase from 
1881~’82 of 547 in youth of school age, of 282 in enrolment in public schools, of 222 in 
average daily attendance at such schools, of 1 in teachers for them, and of $38,979 in 
expenditure upon them, $42,200 being spent during the year for sites, buildings, fur- 
niture, and apparatus. In private and parochial schools there was an estimated en- 
rolment of 975. Music and German, under 2 special teachers, formed part of the 
instruction in the public schools. 
South Bend sends no report of its schools for 1882-’83, but for the year following that 
shows an increase over 188182 of 811 in children of school age, of 172 in enrolment 
in public schools, and of 78 in average attendance, a small advance in the last two 
items for so long a period. The expenditure for school purposes increased by $15,318 
in the two years, $5,104 of this increase going for new school buildings, furniture, and 
apparatus and $8,000 for payment of indebtedness for past improvements. The city 
school property was valued at $11,000 more than in 1881-82. In private and parochial , 
schools there was an estimated enrolment of 600. The number of city school build- 
ings was not increased by the improvements above noted, but 2large and well lighted » 
rooms were added to a building that had been greatly crowded. A night school was 
maintained for some time during the year by one of the teachers, and the attendance 
is said to have been such as to show that many desire instruction in that way after 
the labors of the day are over. 
Terre Haute for 1882~’83 had 12 school buildings, with 4,000 sittings, valued, with 
other school property, at $230,352, providing for 41.26 per cent. of the school popula- 
tion, only 45.12 per cent. of which was enrolled ; adding 1,000 in private and parochial 
schools, only 55.43 per cent. were in school; still 76 per cent. of those enrolled in 
public schools were in average daily attendance. In youth of school age there was no 
change during the year; there were 42 fewer enrolied, 40 more in average daily at- 
tendance, 5 more teachers, and $1,999 more spent for school purposes. One music 
teacher was employed. 
In 1883-84 the city shows the same number of school buildings, with 120 more sit- 
tings, valued, with other property, at $230,909. Compared with the previous year, 
there was a gain of 53 in school population, of 151 in enrolment, of 65 in average daily 
attendance, of 1 teacher, and of $755 in expenditure for schools. One music teacher 
was employed. Besides the city schools, 2 Kindergiirten were maintained. 
Vincennes reported for 1832-83 4 school buildings, with 904 sittings, which provided 
for only 25.10 per cent. of the school population. ‘The enrolment, with 500 in private 
and parochial schools, was only 45.22 per cent. of the youth of school age, leaving 
nearly 55 per cent. not in school. School population fell off 200 ; enrolment, 57; aver- 
age daily attendance, 58; while there was 1 more teacher. 
KINDERGARTEN, 
Beside the 12 Kindergiirten noted in the matter relating to Indianapolis and the 2 
others in Terre Haute, there appear at La Porte, Marion, and Spiceland 1 each, mak- 
ing 17 in the State.

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
The State allows no teacher to be employed in its public schools without evidence 
of good moral character and of literary capacity for good school work. Such evi- 
dence may be obtained as follows: 
(1) Through a certificate from the State board of education, composed of the goy- 
ernor, the State superintendent of public instruction, the presidents of the State 
University, Purdue University, and the State Normal School, with the superintend- 
ents of the three largest city school systems. This certificate must show 48 months 
of successful teaching (at least 16 of them in Indiana) and the passage of a satisfac- 
tory examination in common school branches, physiology, history and Constitution 
of the United States, general history, plane geometry, algebra, elements of physics, of 
zoblogy, and of botany, English and American literature, rhetoric, moral science, 
and the science of teaching. 
(2) Through a certificate from a county superintendent, showing the passage of a 
written and oral examination in the same studies up to physiology and history of the 
United States. 
(3) Through a like certificate from a committee or officer of the school board of a 
city of 30,000 or more inhabitants. 
The certificate from the State board is good throughout the State during the life- 
time or good behavior of the holder; those from county superintendents, good in the 
county where they are issued, for 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, or 36 months, ac- 
cording to the ratio of correct answers given by the holder. INDIANA.

EUG REPORT OF, THE comnefssronts OF EDUCATION. 
_ A professional license, valid for eight years, is also available by holders of 24-month 
licenses, whose next consecutive one shall be for 36 months, or by holders of 36-month 
ones that have received two such in succession; these last only on approval of the 
State board and on examination prescribed by it. 
  STATE NORMAL TRAINING, . 
The Indiana State Normal School, Terre Haute, admits young men of 18 and young 
‘women of 16 years of age. They must possess good moral character, average in- 
tellectual ability, and an acquaintance with the ordinary school studies, and, if 
residents of Indiana, must promise to teach in the common schools of the State a 
period equal to twice that spent in the school. The school ‘provides a 3-year course 
for those who enter with a minimum amount of scholarship and wish to prepare for 
teaching in the common schools, a 2-year course for graduates of the best high schools 
.and academies and for teachers of age and experience, and a 1-year course for graduates 
of colleges and State universities who seek a professional training that may fit them 
» to be superintendents and principals of high schools. For the first mentioned class 
of students a Latin course has been arranged. In 1882~’83 there were 20 resident in- 
structors, 266 male and 374 temale normal students, and 30 graduates. All of these 
graduates engaged in teaching. 
Tn 1883~84 there was a total enrolment of 1,144 during the three terms of the year, 
the largest in the history of the institution, 68 cut of 92 counties being represented 
and 70 per cent. being children of farmers. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
Aspecial spring normal school, to begin April 4, 1883, and to continue 10 weeks, 
was announced by De Pauw College for Young Women, New Albany; also, a sum- 
mer normal, to begin June 27, 1883, and to continue 7 weeks. Like arrangements 
appear for the next year. 
The following schools in 1882~83 showed no changes: Elkhart Normal and Spen- 
cerian Business Institute, Goshen Summer Normal and Business Institute, and South- 
ern Indiana Normal College, Mitchell. 
In 1883-84 the same appears to be generally true of the Central Indiana Normal 
and Business Institute, Ladoga, with 492 students ; Central Normal College and Com- 
mercial Institute, Danville, which has a teachers’ course of 48 weeks; and the South- 
ern Indiana Normal School, Paoli. 
Smithson College, Logansport, is reported by the Indiana School Journal to have 
been leased for 3 years for normal college purposes. It was to be opened as the 
American Normal College, April 1, 1884, under the presidency of Mr. J. Fraise Richard, 
ae known educator. Subsequent information shows that it began with 58 stu- 
ents, 
Hope Normal School and Business College, Hope, a renewal of a former school at that 
place, was also to open in April, 1884, under John Mickelborough, for many years 
principal of the Normal School of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
For 1883~#4 the Indianapolis Normal School shows a course of one year and a half, 1 
instructor, 37 normal students, and 24 graduates, all the last engaged in teaching. 
The Richmond Normal School opened September, 1883, with 5 instructors, and closed 
the year 1883-84 with 240 students enrolled, It has a good 3-year course, which pre- 
pares teachers for the common schools. 
Northern Indiana Normal School, Valparaiso, added during the year 8 new cases of 
books to its library, which is said to be now one of the best equipped in the State. 
The music department has been organized and made a conservatory, with 19 pianos 
and 11 organs in constant use. Many new buildings have been erected. 
A Normal School is reported to have been located at Angola in 1883-84, a company 
having bought 6 acres of land, on which a new building was in process of erection. 
The teachers’ class in the Central Normal School, Danville, graduated 43 in 1883-84. 
The teachers of New Albany have taken up the study of the theory and practice of 
cacene meeting three times a week, and studying the underlying principles of their 
work, 
The review and normal term of the Academy of Purdue University in 1883 took the 
place of the Purdue Normal School. 
The Indianapolis Kindergarten Training School in 188384 had 1 instructor and 9 
pupils, all of whom graduated, with a 2-year course of study. 
Mrs. Hailmann’s Training Class for Kindergartners, at La Porte, reports for 1883~84 
2 instructors, 7 students, and 6 graduates (2 of whom engaged in teaching), and a 
1-year course of study. 
Normal training, in some cases separate from the regular course, in others con- 
nected with it, appears in the latest catalogues of all the colleges but Concordia, 
Franklin, Butler, Notre Dame, and St. Meinrad’s. i

TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
According to the law requiring teachers’ institutes to be held in each county of the 
State at least once a year and in townships at least one Saturday of each mouth, 67 
county institutes are reported to have been held in 1883~84, 
io EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The very useful Indiana School Journal, Indianapolis, the organ of the State super- 
intendent, began its twenty-ninth volume January, 1884, and continued through the 
year, devoting much space to educational methods and principles. 
The Educational Weekly, Indianapolis, began its first volume July, 1883, and was 
in its third in September, 1884. 
The Central Normal News, Danville, began its issues May, 1882, and was inits fourth 
volume in 1884, with quarterly issues, being mainly an advertising sheet for the Cen- 
tral Normal College, Danville. 
The Normal Teacher, formerly of Danville, now of Indianapolis, entered on its 
seventh volume March, 1884, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
High schools, not being expressly provided for in the State law, are not reported. 
They are, however, recognized by the State university and the State board of educa- 
tion, under an arrangement which admits certified graduates of approved high schools 
without examination into the freshman classes of the State and Purdue Universities, 
Such students are also admitted to advanced standing in the State Normal School, by 
which they are enabled to complete the course in 2 years. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For detailed statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory 
schools, and preparatory departments of universities and colleges, see Tables IV, V1, 
VU, IX, and X of the appendix ; for a summary of their statistics, corresponding tables 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Before the opening of the session of 1883~84 the Indiana State University lost by 
fire its main college building, with all its valuable contents, July 12,1483. A desir- 
able campus of 40 acres had, however, been soon secured, on which 2 well planned 
buildings were in process of erection during 1883~84, Since 1875 graduates of 
approved high schools applying for admission to the freshman class have been ad- 
mitted without examination. In 1884 there were 34 such schools. Other candidates 
may be examined by any county superintendent holding a commission from the uni- 
versity for that purpose. All other applicants for admission must be examined by the 
instructors of the high school at Bloomington. Applicants for freshman standing 
must be not less than 15 years old. Women are admitted on equal terms with men. 
The student, on admission, has a choice between 3 collegiate courses, one in ancient 
classics, leading to the degree of A.B. ; one in modern classics, leading to the degree 
of B. LIT. ; and one in science, tena to the degree of B. 8s. These courses are the 
same in length, each 4 years, and will be as nearly as possible equivalents in culture 
and mental discipline, all requiring the same preparation for admission. There were 
143 collegiate and 157 preparatory students, 300 in all, under 11 professors and 5 as- 
sistants. 
For 1882~83 Wabash College, Crawfordsville; Indiana Asbury University, Green- 
castle; the University of Notre Dame; Earlham College, Richmond; and Ridgeville 
College, Ridgeville, show full classical and scientific or philosophical courses of 4 
years each, as well as preparatory courses of 2 and 3 years. All have modern lan- 
guages, with normal and music courses; Asbury has military, business, and theo- 
logical courses; Notre Dame, commercial and Hebrew, and, with Asbury, law courses 
of 2 years, while the former shows a preparatory medical course. 
Catalogues of other universities and colleges for 1883~84 show no material change 
in the amount and character of their work. _For their statistics, see Table IX of the 
appendix, All show classical, scientific, or philosophical courses of 4 years each, with 
preparatory courses of 2and3 years. Wabash, Franklin, and Ridgeville have English 
courses; Wabash, Franklin, Union Christian, Moore’s Hill, and Notre Dame, commer- 
cial; Wabash, DePauw, Hanover, Hartsville, Union Christian, Moore’s Hill, Earlham, 
and Ridgeville, some normal training. All but Wabash, Franklin, Hanover, and 
Earlham gave instruction in music, and these gave training in elocution. Harts- 
ville, Union Christian, Notre Dame, and Ridgeville have lessons in drawing, and all

but Concordia and Hartsville, modern languages. For such as give instruction in 
theology, law, and medicine, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, below. 
Mr. W. C. DePauw having given to the Indiana Asbury University, at Greencastle, 
about $1,500,000, bringing the value of theuniversity property up to about $2,000,000, 
the title has been changed to DePauw University, in honor of the liberal donor. 
Considerable additions to the working force and apparatus have been made, as well 
as arrangements to establish law, medical, and other departments. 
Fort- Wayne College does not yet attempt to give collegiate instruction. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 14 institutions for young men, 11 admit women on thesame terms. Of those 
for young women, St. Mary’s Academic Institute had in 188283 ety intermediate, 
and senior departments, with 78 students and 7 graduates. The senior department 
embraces the higher and ornamental studies of a good course. 
In 1883~84 the DePauw College for Young Women, New Albany, showed a prepar- 
atory course of 1 year, a scientific of 2, and a classical of 4 years, with a normal depart- 
ment and schools of music and art, elocution, and domestic science, with needlework, 
wood carving, and designing in clay. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Tn 1882~83 and 1883~84 the Indiana State University and 11 other collegiate insti- 
tutions continued to offer scientific instruction, some fully, others to only a moderate 
extent. : 
Purdue University, La Fayette, the chief and oldest of the scientific schools of the 
State, changed in 1882~83 its courses of study, making its work more distinctively 
technical and scientific, remanding to the rear the scientific course, which had held 
the leading position, and bringing the course in agriculture and horticulture to the 
front, with less study of mathematics and more of natural sciences. The revised 
curricula, with some subsequent changes, include now a school of agriculture and 
horticulture, a school of mechanics and engineering, a school of science, and a school 
of industrial art, each of 4 years, with a preparatory class of 2 years. Students in 
1882~’83, 219, of whom 90 were in collegiate studies (3 of them graduates), 33 in me- 
chanics, industrial art, chemistry, botany, and engineering, and the others in aca- 
demic studies. The graduates of the yearnumbered 16. Owing to asomewhat higher 
standard for admission the number of students was 19 less than in the previous year. 
Statistics for 1483-84 are wanting. A school of pharmacy was announced for 1884~85. 
Women are admitted on like conditions as young men. At the close of 188283 
President E. E. White, who had brought to it a large educational experience and had 
done much to bring it to its present high standard of efficiency, resigned his place 
because of adverse action in the State senate, and was succeeded by Hon. James H. 
Smart, formerly State superintendent of public instruction. He is aided by a staff 
of 18 professors and instructors. 
The Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, commenced its sessions March 7, 1883, 
with a faculty of 8 instructors, Charles O. Thompson, president, and had at the end of 
the year 1883-84 45 students, 3 of them juniors, 26 sophomores, and 16 freshmen. The 
founder, Mr. Chauncey Rose, left to the institution property exceeding $500,000, The 
school is to be devoted to the higher education of young men in engineering, including 
in this term all those productive and constructive arts by which the forces of nature 
are made subservient to the needs of man and the principles which underlie these 
arts. Instruction is to be given in mechanical drawing and engineering, civil engi- 
neering, chemistry, and physics. A department of mining engineering is contem- 
plated. German and French are to be studied. A course in geology will be given to 
the senior class. The cabinet has a collection of 5,000 minerals; the library, of 5,000 
yolumes. The institute occupies a well sodded campus of ten acres, on which are 
the academy building, the shops, and laboratory. The academic building is a hand- 
some brick edifice, 4 stories high, 100 feet deep, and contains 46 rooms. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology.— There is no regular theological school in Indiana, theology being studied 
in 5 schools as a mere auxiliary to university and college courses, with no changes 
since 188182. In 1862~’s3 the Union Christian College, Merom (Christian), showed 
a 3-year course, and Indiana Asbury University, Greencastle (Methodist Episcopal), 
raised its theological department to a like standard for 1883~84. 
Law.— DePauw University will, under its new title and régime, reorganize its law 
department. 
The University of Notre Dame in 1883 extended its legal course to'3 years; raised 
its standard of studies, it is claimed, to the mést approved plane ; and partially sub- 
stituted the lecture system for the compulsory use of text books. No special prepa-.

ration is required for matriculation. Any student who is 17 years of age and has a 
fair English education is eligible. 
Medicine.— “‘ Regular” medical instruction was given in 1882-83 by the Medical 
College of Evansville; the Hospital Medical College, of the same place, opened ir 
that year; the Medical College of Fort Wayne and the Fort Wayne College of Medi- 
cine; and the Medical College of Indiana and the Central College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, both at Indianapolis. All required some preliminary education, with the 
usual 3-year tutelage under a medical preceptor and an attendance on at least 2 full 
lecture courses of from 20 to 24 weeks each, this last at the Fort Wayne College of 
Medicine, which in two preceding reports has been unfortunately confounded with the 
Medical College of Fort Wayne, a less reputable school, that suspended in 1853. With 
this exception, the same colleges continued their instruction through the session of 
1883~’84, when the Medical College of Evansville also ceased to teach, leaving only 
4 regular schools. The 6 colleges had 227 matriculates and graduated 101 in 1482~83; 
the 5 of the next year, 145 matriculates and 72 graduates. The Medical College of 
Indiana, which had been from 1878 a department of Butler University, Irvington, 
severed its connection with that university in 1833, 
Of the eclectic school, there were 2 colleges in 1882~’83, the Indiana Eclectic and the 
Beach Medical College, each requiring some preliminary education for admission and 
attendance on at least 2 annual lecture courses of 20 weeks. In the next year the 
Beach school was merged in the other. The matriculates of both were only 24 in the 
former year; the graduates, only 7; in the latter, the one remaining school reported 
31 matriculates and 10 gradua‘es. 
An independent school, the Physio-Medical College of Indiana, organized in 1873, 
requiring fair preliminary training and attendance on 2 full lecture courses of 24 
weeks each, reported 21 matriculates and 11 graduates in 1882-83 and 40 matricu- 
lates and 7 graduates in 1883~84, ‘ 
Dentistry.— The Indiana Dental College, Indianapolis, issued its usual annual an- 
nouncement for 1882-83, indicating but slight requirements for either admission or 
graduation. No subsequent information respecting it has been received. 
For statistics of professional schools, see Tables XI to XIII of the appendix; for 
summaries, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Indiana Institution for Educating the Deaf and Dumb had in 1882~83 a tota’ 
of 328 pupils (175 males, 153 females), under 18 instructors, of whom 7 were semi- 
mutes. Since its foundation, 1,495 have received instruction, remaining in the in- 
stitution an average of 5 years. In school, the common school branches, with script- 
ure, natural history and philosophy, rhetoric, algebra, and articulation, were taught. 
In the industrial department, 15 boys worked at shoemaking, 37 at cabinet work, 
64 at chair caning, 2 at baking, 2 in the greenhouse, and 1 in the dairy. The girls _ 
do light chamber work, ironing in laundry; 75 were trained to sew, cut, and fit gar- 
ments, to crochet, and to make fancy work. The library contained 3,195 volumes. 
fesben” of the institution was valued at $457,925; State appropriation for the year, ; 000. 
No report for 1883~84 has been received. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, 
The superintendent of the Indiana Institute for the Education of the Blind, at the 
close of the session of 1883~84, said that the several departments are thoroughly or- 
ganized and the work of instruction has been directed by the teachers with fidelity 
and discretion; the pupils have been obedient, tractable, and industrious. 
There is but one session for the year, beginning in September and closing the fol- 
lowing June, a period of 40 weeks. The total number in attendance for the session, 
was 120, 58 males and 62 females, 21 being newcomers, 
Instruction is given in three distinct departments: literary, musical, and indus- 
trial. The literary department is divided into six grades, in Taege of 5 experienced 
teachers. In the musical department there are three sections: vocal, instrumental, 
and tuning. In this last the training of teachers is an important part of instruction, 
as many of the pupils expect to teach music and tuning when they leave the school. 
The industrial department has a workroom for girls and one for boys. 
The female pupils receive daily instruction in sewing, knitting, crocheting, and in 
making fancy and useful articles of thread, worsted, and beads. The older girls aro 
taught to run the sewing machine, to mend and darn, and keep in repair their own 
clothing. The number of articles finished during the session was 1,555, of a cash 
value of $369.37. In the boys’ shop, in addition to the usual broom making, cane 
seating of chairs was successfully introduced, awakening a new interest in the indus+ 
trial work for. boys.

EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
No later report than that for 1882 has been received from the asylum for this class 
at Knightstown, where there were then 81 pupils, under 3 teachers, 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
For statistics of a nnmber of institutions in which instruction is given to orphan 
children, see Table XXII of the appendix. 
INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC, ART, ETC. 
The Island Park Assembly, Sylvan Lake, in its hand book for 1883, shows arrange- 
ments for a music college, with apparently large facilities for voice culture, chorus 
classes, class in harmony, and an old fashioned singing schvol. The sessions are held 
each summer. The session for 1883 was to begin July 2 and to continue at least until 
July 23. Besides music, instruction in microscopy, languages, elocution, art, and the 
theory, science, and art of teaching may be had at the assembly, which appears to be 
ettled on a firm foundation and to be gradually broadening the scope of possible 
studies. 
CHILDREN’S TOME. 
The first annual report of the Children’s Home, Madison, gives an account of its 
work in 1883~84. It receives children who otherwise would be confined with the 
vicious, insane, and imbecile of the poorhouse, and those suffering from abuse and 
neglect in poverty stricken homes, and aims to prevent crime and pauperism by giv- 
ing them some chance for their future. During the year 50 were admitted, 12 returned 
to parents or guardians, and good homes were found for 15, leaving at the close of the 
year 21 girls and 9 boys. The children admitted have been from 3 to 11 years of age. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Flower Mission Training School for Nurses, Indianapolis, in 1883~84 continued 
its work, and expected to build a home at a cost of $3,500. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Indiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls, Indianapolis, has pens 
and reformatory departments. Children from 6 to 15 are admitted. During 1882~83 
of the 133 inmates 34 were committed on the reform side and 16 discharged and 17 com- 
mitted on the prison side and 25 discharged. Since committal, about one-third have 
learned to read and one-half to write. Inmates are in school one-half the day and 
are taught the ordinary branches of the common school. In the industrial depart- 
ment, on the reform side, the training is in general housework and caning chairs; on 
the prison side, making overcoats and shirts. Of the 539 committed since founda- 
tion, 82 per cent. are known to have become orderly and useful members of society. 
When discharged, they are usually placed in christian families, 
The Indiana Reform School for Boys, Plainfield, under State control, employs 17 male 
and 13 female officers and teachers; admits boys from 8 to 16 years of age for crime, and 
from 10 to 17 for incorrigibility. Of the 385 inmates, 149 were committed and 166 put 
out on trial in 188283. Of the 1,930 committed since its establishment, 93 per cent. 
are known to have become orderly and useful members of society. None are dis- 
‘charged, but such as promise well are put out on trial. In school, the ordinary com- 
mon school branches are taught; in the industries, farming, pesemeling| carpentry, 
baking, cobbling, tailoring, plumbing, and plastering. Earnings for 1882~83, $5,000; 
total expenditure, $45,000. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The county superintendents held their annual meeting at Indianapolis, commencing 
June 26, 1883, and continuing in session two days, with Mr. B. F. Johnson in the chair. 
About 70 superintendents were present, making the largest and it is said the most 
profitable meeting of its kind ever held in the State. The specially important feat- 
ure of the occasion was the ‘‘Gradation of licenses under the new law,” presented 
by Hon. H. §. Tarbell. Mr. Tarbell stated in his paper that the changes are impor- 
tant ones and may result in great harm to the school interests or be the means of 
important benefits, as they may be judiciously or otherwise applied. 
The evident purpose of the law was to allow spetial fitness for teaching to weigh 
largely in determining the granting of certificates; to make a broader distinction 
than heretofore between the several grades of teaching; to cut off many of the poorest 
teachers ; to relieve progressive, capable teachers from the drudgery of frequent ex- 
aminations; to make for the more competent teachers a standard uniform throughout _ 
the State, thereby securing a greater uniformity in all the work of examinations; and, 
finally, to emphasize the value of professional attainments in teachers,

  INDIANA, 81 
The annual meeting of this body in 1884 was held at Indianapolis June 10-13, State 
Superintendent Holcombe in the chair. He gave in a few opening remarks a review 
of its work. The first convention was held in 1862, the second in 1866, the third in 
1873, soon after the county superintendency law went into effect, since which time 
the meetings have been held annually. A number of interesting papers were read 
and discussed. Resolutions disapproving of the publication of answers to State board 
questions were unanimously adopted. A committee on course of study made a report 
recommending that the course be divided into 3 standards, primary, intermediate, 
and advanced, which, after a spirited discussion, was adopted, and another committee 
was appointed to draft a model course; it subsequently reported a course embracing 
5 grades and covering 8 years. 
Among the resolutions adopted were the following: (1) That the scale of grada- 
tion of teachers’ licenses adopted in 1883 should be adhered to; (2) that special fitness 
should be considered in the examination of teachers for graded schools in towns and 
cities; (3) that arbor day exercises be approved and an autumn arbor day be rec- 
ommended; (4) that the graduation of pupils from the district schools tends to in- 
crease interest and faithfulness in school work. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its thirtieth annual session at Indianapolis December 26-28, 
1883, the retiring president, Hon. H. 8. Tarbell, introducing his successor, Dr. John 
S. Irwin. There were present 284 teachers, from 66 counties. 
After the inaugural address of the president, papers were presented by C. W. Hodgin, 
principal of the Richmond Normal School, on the question of ‘Separate schools for 
colored youth, for truants, and for both sexes in common schools;” by James Bald- 
win, on “‘ The common schools of a quarter of a century hence;” by W. N. Hailmann, 
on “The moral results public school training should give and the results it does give;” 
by Prof. W. H. Payne, of Michigan University, on ‘‘ The science of education: its nat- 
ure, methods, and some of its problems;” all of which were ordered: to be printed 
and may be found in successive numbers of the Indiana School Journal. Miss Mary 
H. Krout read a paper on ‘‘ The model teacher,” which is said to have been bright and 
interesting. A paper on ‘‘The school-house and its surroundings” urged the planting of 
trees and cee on school grounds and contained many excellent suggestions. Other 
papers read were on “The study of English in schools” and on ‘‘School incentives.” 
Ascommittee appointed to confer with the State Horticultural Association concerning 
the decoration of school grounds reported in favor of codperation in so desirable a 
work. oe resolutions were then adopted, after which the convention ad- 
journed. 
y INDIANA COLLEGE ASSOCIATION. 
The members of this body met in conjunction withthe members of the State Teachers’ 
Association, above noted, Prof. L. 8S. Thompson, of Purdue University, opening the ses- 
sion with a paper on ‘‘Art in American colleges,” which subject was further treated 
in a paper by Miss R. J. Thompson, of Franklin College. President Stott then pre- 
sented papers on ‘The college and the Commonwealth” and “College degrees,” 
which were discussed by President Everest and by Dr. Ridpath, of DePauw University. 
In the afternoon a paper was read by Dr. George B. Brown, of the State Normal School, 
on ‘The classification of knowledge,” Dr. Ridpath presenting in connection with the 
topic an elaborate chart of the classification of knowledge proposed by Bishop Wilkins. 
The association then appointed Prof. Robert P. Warden, of Purdue University, to pre- 
sent at its next annual meeting a plan for graduate courses of study, and, after elect- 
ing officers for the ensuing year, adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The figures given above under the heading 1881~82 have been furnished by the 
office of the State superintendent as belonging to the year 1882~83, but as they coin- 
cide in almost every respect with those (furnished from the same source) which have 
heretofore appeared for 1881~82 and as the increases noted are exceedingly large, it 
is believed that the statistics cannot refer to two successive years. These figures, 
then, are given subject to revision. 
As may be seen, the increase shown in 1883~84 is large (even for a period of two 
years) in every important particular, that in enrolment going far beyond the growth 
of school youth, that in average attendance going proportionally almost as far, while 
the number of public schools and of school- houses is fairly proportioned to the great 
growth in school enrolment, as are the expenditure for schools, the valuation of school 
property, and the reported permanent school fund. The only apparent falling off is 
in the number of men employed as teachers, which shows a continuation of the | preva- 
lent tendency to substitute women formen. A comparatively small increase of teach- 
ers indicates that, except in this change from men to women, there has, been more 
permanency of tenure on the whole and that better training in institutes and normal 
schools is making at least a full year’s continuance more sure,

ADMINISTRATION. 
A State superintendent, elected for 2-year terms in each odd numbered year, has 
general supervision of the public schools. Each county has a school superintendent ; 
each township and independent district, a board of directors; each subdistrict into 
which a township may be divided, a subdirector, the subdirectors of the subdistricts 
forming a district township board. Women are eligible to any school office in the 
State, and since 1882 one member of the State board of examiners must be a woman. 
For the State board to examine teachers, see Preparation and Qualifications of Teachers. 
Public schools must be taught in each subdistrict for at least 120 days in the year 
and are free to all resident youth of school age (5-21), Besides common schools the 
system includes high schools, a State normal school, teachers’ institutes, a State uni- 
versity, agricultural college, reform school, institutions for the deaf and dumb, for the 
blind, and for the feeble-minded. To be legally employed, teachers must have cer- 
tificates of qualification. They must keep a register and make annual reports to the 
board of directors, which in turn reports to the county superintendent, and he to the 
State superintendent. If not already growing there, at least 12 shade trees must be 
set out at each school site, and it is the duty of the county superintendent to see that 
this is done. Industrial expositions, for displaying useful articles made by public 
school pupils, are encouraged by a law of 1874; they are to be held in the school rooms 
and on a school day as often as once a term, 
FINANCES. 
Public schools are sustained from the income of a State school fund and from county 
and district taxes. The State fund, comprising the proceeds of public school lands 
sold and rented, of intestate estates, and such other means as the general assembly 
may provide, is distributed to the districts in proportion to the number of youth 5 to 
21, County taxes must be not less than one mill normore than three millson the dollar; 
district taxes must not exceed 10 mills on $1 for a school-house fund, $5 a pupil for a 
contingent fund, or $15 foreach resident pupil for a teachers’ fund, this last including 
the amount received from the State by semiannual apportionment. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
Under a general law, cities, towns, and villages with not less than 200 inhabitants 
may be constituted separate school districts and may attach to such districts contigu- 
ous territory by vote of the electors in the proposed addition. Public schools are 
controlled by boards of 6 directors in cities with 500 or more inhabitants, 2 of these 
directors being subject to change each year. For the larger cities superintendents ~ 
of schools are usually employed,

A Cedar Rapids return shows for 1882-83 an increase of 145 in youth of school age, 
of 109 in enrolment in primary, grammar, and high schools, and of 225 in average

daily attendance, with $19,147 more expended on the city system. The schools were 
taught 179 days in 13 buildings, with 46 rooms for study and a seating capacity of 
2,422. A special teacher of penmanship was employed. Enrolment in 2. private or 
church schools, 250. Estimated value of public school property, $142,500. 
The Clinton public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught 
187 days in 1883~84, the teaching force comprising 2 men and 40 women. Its six 
school buildings, capable of accommodating 1,779 pupils, were valued, wiih sites, 
furniture, and apparatus, at $90,500. Abont 325 pupils, it was estimated, attended 
private and parochial schools, making 2,525 under instruction. The statistics show 
a slight increase in school youth and average attendance, with $1,538 more in ex- 
penditure for schools under the city system as compared with 1881-82; the enrol- 
ment fell off somewhat. 
Council Bluffs for 1882~’83 reports public schools classed as primary, grammar, and 
high, taught 196 days in 15 buildings, with 48 rooms, capable of accommodating 
2,654 pupils. School property was valued at $144,300. Mstimated enrolment in pri- 
vate schools, 210. 
In 1883-84, with the same classification of the schools and the same number of 
buildings for them, there was 1 more room, with 64 more ceats for pupils, who had 
increased by 186, with 4 fewer in average attendance. The rating of school property 
cane the same as in 1882~83. Penmanship was taught in both years by a special 
teacher. 
Davenport presents statistics for two years. These show an enrolment of different 
pupils in the ordinary public schools less by 47 in 1882~83 than in 188182; but 11 
pupils in a city normal school and 263 in 2 evening schools bring up the numbers en- 
rolled and in average attendance beyond those of the earlier year, and expenditures 
for the city schools were greater by $3,940. The valuation of school property belong- 
ing to the city remained nearly the same for the next year, the number of school 
buildings not having increased, while attendance appears to have diminished. Music, 
drawing, and penmanship were taught by the regular teachers. 
Dubuque, in a return marked ‘For the year ending September 1, 1833,” but not re- 
ceived t¥1 January 14, 1884, and possibly relating to 188384, presents an increase 
from 1881~82 of 410 in youth of school age, of 44 in enrolment in public schools, and 
of 80 in average daily attendance, with thé same number of teachers, but an expendi- 
ture for city schools smaller by $3,872. The schools— primary, grammar, and high — 
occupied the same 9 buildings, with 3,550 sittings, reported in 1881~82. Value of 
school property, $170,000: estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 
2,700, an increase of 80. For the city schools there was a special teacher of German, 
but none for music, drawing, or penmanship. 
The Keokuk public schools in 1883-84 were taught 188 days by 7 men and 43 women. 
School accommodations were sufficient for 2,241 pupils, somewhat less than the actual 
number enrolled, but more than the average daily attendance. The value of all 
school property was put at $100,000. About 500 pupils attended private and parochial 
schools, making a total of 3,057 under instruction during some portion of the year. 
Music, drawing, and penmanship were taught in the public schools. From 1881~82 
the increase shown is 24 in school youth, 96 in enrolment, 2 in average attendance, 
and $5,478 in expenditure for city schools. 
Muscatine, apparently for 1882~83, reports primary, grammar, and high schools 
taught 200 days in 10 buildings, with 31 rooms for both study and recitation, besides 
5 for recitation only, and 1,700 sittings, all the school property valued at $115,000. 
Enrolment in private and church schools, about 200. Penmanship in the city 
schools was taught by a special teacher. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS, 
STATE REQUIREMENTS. . 
The law requires teachers in the public schools to possess scholarship, ability to 
govern, and apthess to teach. Examinations are conducted by county superintend- 
ents and are said to be made with a view of obtaining the actual measure of the 
proficiency of the applicant in each branch. Special teachers of music, drawing, 
penmanship, book-keeping, German or other language, are examined with reference 
to such branches and may be employed to teach only the branches upon which they 
have been examined. Teachers’ certificates are for 1-year terms only. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING, 
The Iowa State Normal School, Cedar Falls, organized in 1876, presents a 3-year 
didactic course of 40 weeks each year, which prepares teachers for common and high 
schools, and a scientific course of one additional year, fitting teachers to be superin- 
tendents and principals of high and normal schools and academies. For admission 
students must sign a statement of their intention to teach in the public schools of the 
State. ‘The State in 1883~84 appropriated $7,750 for teachers’ pay, $30,000 for build-     
 
-P-A-G-E-357

ing purposes, and $3,000 for incidentals. There were 293 students in attendance dur- 
ing the year, under 9 instructors, and 13 were graduated. A model school was es- 
tablished in 1883, with 52 pupils. Graduates receive certificates, which do not, how- 
ever, entitle them to teach in the public schools without further examination. 
The chair of didactics of the State university, Iowa City, an elective course pursued 
during the entire senior year, comprises the study of school management, organiza- 
tion, and supervision, with careful reading of the subjects of history of education, 
national systems of education, and practical educational topics; there is also a brief 
course of lectures. Students completing this course are entitled to receive certificates 
of qualification as teachers. After two years of successful teaching, graduates may 
receive the degree of bachelor of didactics. There were 42 students in attendance 
during 1883-84, of whom 12 were graduated ; 9 of these engaged in teaching. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS, 
The Eastern Iowa Normal School, Columbus Junction, formerly at Grand View, founded 
in 1874 and said to be the oldest normal school in the State, presents 2 courses of nor- 
mal instruction, an elementary of 3 years and an advanced of 2 additional years. 
pentnates from the advanced course receive the degree of bachelor of didactic phi- 
osophy. 
Dexter Normal School, Dexter, reported a normal preparatory course covering 2 
years, which, with 1 additional year, constitutes the full normal course. 
Normal instruction was given at Amity, Tabor, and Western Colleges, in 2-year 
courses; at Iowa College, in 1 year; at Cornell College, in 2 courses, preparatory and 
advanced, of 2 years each; at Upper Iowa University and Norwegian Luther Col- 
lege, in 3-year courses; at Drake, Oskaloosa, and Penn Colleges, in 4-year courses ; 
and at Parsons and Simpson Centenary Colleges and Central and Iowa Wesleyan 
Universities, in courses not defined. Whittier Collego and Normal Institute, Salem, 
when last heard from, offered normal training in connection with the college studies, 
including practical work in organizing schools and conducting classes. 
Iowa City Academy offered a 3-year normal course, from which 16 students were 
graduated in 186384. 
Training in the theory and practice of teaching was given in connection with the 
ow school systems of Davenport and West Des Moines. 
training school for teachers is said to have been established at Marshalltown, 
course not»defined, 
The Normal and Scientific Institution, Bloomfield, formerly known as the Southern 
Towa Normal School and Commercial Institute, presented for 1883-84 a 3-year course 
of normal instruction to 255 students, of which number 18 were graduated, 12 of whom 
engaged in teaching. There are beginning, advanced, and review classes each term. _ 
The studies pursued comprise the common English branches, with book-keeping, chem- 
istry, geology, zodlogy and botany, penmanship and drawing, vocal music, Latin and 
German. Special attention is given to a teachers’ training class. 
West Des Moines Training School reported 6 normal pupils and 6 graduates for 1884, 
and the normal department of Davenport High School, 12 students and 12 graduates, the 
course of study in each extending over a school year. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County superintendents must hold normal institutes annually in their counties, 
and, with the concurrence of the State superintendent of public instruction, they may 
procure the necessary assistance in teaching, the expenses to be defrayed from the pro- 
ceeds of a registration fee of $1 from each person attending the institute and the same 
from each applicant for a certificate. Whenever reasonable assurance is given by the 
county superintendent of any county to the State superintendent that not less than 
20 teachers of the county desire to assemble in an institute to remain in session 6 days, 
the State superintendent is required to convene such institute, the expense not to ex- 
ceed $50, which amount is allowed to each county for this purpose from public funds. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The principal educational journals in the State are The lowa Normal Monthly, pub- 
lished at Dubuque, which entered on its fourth volume in August, 1884, and the Cen- 
tral School Journal, Keokuk, in its seventh volume, both containing much to interest 
and aid teachers in their work. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The law provides for the establishment of high schools in counties having 2,000 or 
more inhabitants. There were 36 such schools in 1883-84 approved by the State uni- 
versity as preparatory schools for it. Graduates from these are admitted to the uni-  
-P-A-G-E-358
86 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
versity without further examination, except in some one branch of study as a test; 
but certificates from the principals of the schools, with specific statements as to the 
amount of work done in each study, must be presented. The same rule applies to 15 
private and church schools, students from which are received on similar terms, 
It was proposed that for 1884~’85 the list of such accepted schools should be revised 
and a classification of them be made on the basis of the extent of preparation. This 
will be likely to lead to a generally higher standard, 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools for pro- 
paring students foy college, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and sum- 
maries of these in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The State University of lowa, Iowa City, comprises 5 departments, collegiate, legal, 
“regular” medical, homeopathic medical, and dental, with a total faculty of 43 pro- 
fessors and instructors. 
The collegiate department embraces a school of letters, with classical and philo- 
sophical courses of 4 years each, and a school of science, with scientific and engineer- 
ing courses, each of 4 years. Candidates for degrees are required to make an election 
of one of these four courses and will not be allowed, without permission, to pursue 
more or less than 3 studies at a time except as required by the program, while stu- 
dents not candidates for graduation, on complying with the terms of admission, will 
be allowed to select their studies from the four courses under the direction of the 
faculty. Resident graduates of this or other institutions desiring to prosecute ad- 
vanced studies may become connected with the university and avail themselves of 
such facilities as the several chairs afford. The university accepte the graduates of 
36 high schools and 14 academies or preparatory schools without examination; the 
right to examine such students in some one branch of study, however, is reserved. 
In the school of letters both courses are chiefly devoted to instruction in language, 
literature, and history, the difference between the classical and philosophical courses 
being in the attention given to ancient language in the former and to modern in the 
latter, including German, French, Italian, and Spanish. The libraries of the uni- 
versity aggregate 18,000 volumes, with 70 American and European periodicals in the 
reading room. The collegiate faculty, which includes both literary and scientific 
teachers, consisted in 1843~84 of 18 professors and instructors, having under them 
240 students, of whom 70 were females. Of the 240, a class of 35 was graduated, 6 
of them as bachelors of arts, 19 as bachelors of philosophy, 4 as bachelors of science, 
and 6 as civil engineers. The university has $212,000 in productive funds, yielding 
an annual income of $16,000. There is also an annual State appropriation of $24,000, 
making a total revenue'of $40,000. 
of the other 18 institutions for superior instruction, all but Griswold, Luther, and 
St. Joseph’s Colleges admit women the same as men; all show preparatory courses of 
1 to 4 years, mostly of 2 years; all, classical of 4 years; all but Amity, Griswold, 
Luther, and St. Joseph’s, scientific of 4 years, Amity and Griswold having 3-year 
scientific, and Luther and St. Joseph’s none. Normal courses of 2 to 4 years appear 
in 13, while 3 give normal instruction in connection with the regular college studies ; 
11 have commercial and business courses; 2, ladies’ courses of 4 years; 13, music 
courses of 1 or 2 to 3 years; 12, courses in art; 6, in theology; 8, in law; and 2, in 
medicine, 1 other in law and 4 others in medicine appearing elsewhere than in these 
colleges. 
Bor etatisttes, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of them, a correspond- 
ing table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 19 colleges for young men or for both sexes previously presented, 16, including 
the State University, are open to young women as well as to young men, while Drake 
University, Des Moines, under the influence of the Disciples, and Iowa College, Grin- 
nell (Congregational), have special ladies’ courses of 4 years each, in both cases of 
fair collegiate standard. Besides these there are 4 minor institutions which in their 
higher departments are devoted wholly to young women, namely, Immaculate Con- 
ception Academy, Davenport; Callanan College, Des Moines; St. Agatha’s Academy, 
Towa City, and Mt. Pleasant Female Seminary, Mt. Pleasant, 2 of which are authorized 
to confer degrees. 
For statistics of these 4, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary of their sta- 
tistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State University of Iowa offers in its school of science 2 courses, scientific and 
engineering, each of 4 years, The scientific course is meant to lay a foundation on 
which students may build in any special branch of scientific work, and also to meet 
the demand for thorough preparation for scientific teaching in the high schools. Tho 
engineering course, similar to the scientific in its general aim, devotes the latter part of 
its time to engineering science and practice, 
The Lowa Agricultural College, Ames, continued in 1883~84 its arrangement of studies 
under general and technical courses, Under tie first is a course in the sciences related 
to industries, which aims to give a fair preparation for the great industries of the 
country, without especially confining itself to any particular pursuit. This being for 
both sexes, the course is given a considerable degree of flexibility to meet the wants 
of each, The technical courses, while giving a liberal culture, aim also so to direct 
it as to meet the requirements of a special pursuit or profession, These courses are: 
(1) in agriculture ; (2) in mechanical engineering; (3) in civil engineering ; (4) in 
veterinary science; and (5) in domestic economy. The 2 last mentioned are each of 
2 years; the others, of 4 years. These courses are arranged in schools having special 
faculties, In the department of military science and tactics young men are fitted for 
positions in the State troops as line officers and company instructors. Provision is 
made for mixed optional and graduate courses and the study of commercial law. 
French, German, and vocal and instrumental music are taught by female instructors, 
There were 22 “officers of instruction,” 5 of them women, with 252 students in all 
departments, the graduating class in 1833 being 29, of whom 13 were women. 
The scientific courses of the other colleges vary from 3 to 4 years in duration and in 
the extent and kind of scientific work done. In 3 instances the courses are slightly 
varied by Latin and philosophy. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.—No distinctively theological school appears in the State. Theology ts 
taught in 3-year courses at Griswold and German Colleges, in the former of which 3 
candidates for orders appear in a report for 1884. At Oskaloosa College theological 
instruction is given in a 4-year course of sacred literature, in indefinite ones at lowa 
Wesleyan and Simpson Centenary Colleges, in a 2-year Bible course at Drake Univer- 
sity, and slightly in the ecclesiastical department at St. Joseph’s College. 
For statistics of the above, see Table XI of the appendix; for a summary of same, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Law.—The course of instruction in the law department of the State university, here- 
tofore but one year, now extends over 2 school years of 40 weeks each, the change 
being required by an act of April 5, 1884, Candidates for graduation, on the passage 
of a satisfactory examination under the direction of justices of the supreme court of the 
State, receive diplomas from the regents of the university which admit them to the 
bar without further examination. finder 4 professors and 4 lecturers there were in 
1882~’83 120 regular students and 6 irregular; in 1883~84, 132, all regular. 
The lowa College of Law, a department of Drake University, Des Moines, in 1883-’84 
shows a course aueanided from 1 to 2 years, according to the new law, under a faculty 
of 15 instructors, with 18 students, against 14 in 1862~’83. Graduates receive the de- 
gree of bachelor of laws and are admitted to any court in the State. : 
The Iowa Wesleyan College offers legal instruction under 2 instructors, but its 
course remains somewhat undefined, and the last report in 1881-82 showed no stu- 
dents. 
Keokuk College of Law, Keokuk, presents for 1883-84 a law course covering 1 year 
of 40 weeks, with an offer of an extended course after graduation, under 20 instructors. 
Students in 1882~’83, 21, of whom 8 graduated. By the law above referred to, its 
course must in the future cover 2 years to secure the admission of its graduates to the 
courts. No preliminary examination seems to be required, nor any prior reading of 
law. 
Medicine.—“ Regular” medical instruction was given in 1882~83 by the medical de- 
partment of the State university; the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Keokuk; 
and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Iowa, Des Moines. Each of the 3 re- 
quires some preliminary study, the usual 3 years with a physician, and attendance on 
2 full courses of lectures, of 20 weeks each in the first two, of 22 weeks in the third. 
They continued their instruction through the session of 1883-84 without change. 
In the homeopathic medical department of the State university special instruction 
continued through the 2 years, with lecture term and requirements the same as in the 
regular school. 
Sclectic instruction was given in 1882~83 by the Iowa Medical College, a depart- 
ment of Drake University, and in 1883~84 also by King Eclectic Medical College, Des

Moines, which opened for instruction in 1883. The former requires for admission a 
good elementary education; for graduation, the usual 3 years’ study and 2 lecture 
courses of 24 weeks each; the latter, no previous preparation, but for graduation 3 
years’ study, with 2 full courses of lectures of 20 weeks each, or 2 years’ study and 3 
courses of lectures, or 4 courses with no previous reading. 
Training in veterinary practice continues in one of the courses of the Iowa Agricult- 
ural College at Ames. It is the expressed purpose of this school to meet the increas- 
ing demand for trained veterinary practitioners growing out of the vast stock inter- 
ests of the West and the enormous losses from sporadic and contagious diseases 
among domestic animals. The course of study covers 2 years, under a special faculty 
ot 4 instructors; it includes lectures on the technical and special topics of the course 
and practice in microscopical and anatomical laboratories and in the veterinary hos- 
pital. Candidates for graduation must pass their examinations with the standing 
required in the other college courses and present a thesis in veterinary science ; if 
successful, they receive the degree of doctor of veterinary medicine. 
Dentistry continued to be taught in the State university. Requirements for gradu- 
ation: Mature age, 2 years of dental study, attendance on 2 lecturé courses (apparently 
of 30 weeks each), the preparation of a satisfactory case of artificial teeth, a practical 
operation on natural teeth, and the passage of a final examination. - Matriculates in 
1883~84, 31; graduates, 13; teaching faculty, 8, besides 2 special lecturers and 15 
clinical instructors, 
For statistics of all the above medical schools, see Table XIII of the appendix; for 
a summary of the same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Iowa Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Council Bloffs, in 1882~63 gave free 
instruction to 225 pupils in the common and higher English branches and in the em- 
ployments of carpentry, broom and dress making, gardening, printing, and shoemak- 
ing, all under 18 instructors, besides the president. The institution owned 80 acres 
of land, which, with buildings, &¢c., was valued at $200,000, The appropriation from 
the State for the year was $16,000. Articulation was taught to such as were deemed 
capable of profiting by it. Whole number of pupils from foundation, 369. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The State also provided for the instruction of the blind in the College for the Blind 
Vinton, the branches taught being primary, grammar, and high; the industries, bea 
work, broom and mattress making, cane seating, and sewing. 
In 1883~84 there were 125 pupils enrolled, under 30 instructors and other employés. 
The estimated value of the buildings, grounds, &c., was $350,000; total receipts, 
- $35,864; expenditures, $31,312, 
{ EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
At the Iowa Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home and Home for Indigent Children, Davenport, 
there were 68 soldiers’ orphans and 150 county children in 1882~83. Since the opening 
of the Soldiers’ Home, in 1862, there have been received 1,450 orphans, and the depart- 
ment for indigent children since its opening, in 1876, has received 250 of that class. 
The schools are graded, under 3 teachers, open 9 months in the year, and in session 54 
hours a day for 5 days in the week. The boys are instructed in gardening and the 
girls in general housework and sewing; industrial drawing is taught in all the 
departments. 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Iowa Institution for Feeble-Minded Children, Glenwood, established in 1876, 
had 239 children of this class enrolled in 188283, to whom were given the elements 
of a common school education. There were 12 receiving instruction in drawing, and 
a large number, in plain sewing. x 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The State Reform School, with a department for girls at Mitchellville and one for 
boys at Eldora, undertakes the education, reformation, and industrial training of 
youth committed to its charge. The childrenin both departments are required to at- 
tend school 4 hours each day of the school months, the boys to receive instruction in 
hat and shoe making, farming, gardening, and stock raising, and the girls to be 
trained in general housework,

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Iowa State Teachers’ Association held its twenty-eighth annual meeting at 
Des Moines, December 26-28, 1883, with an enrolment of 435 members. the number 
being greater than ever before and larger by 160 than in1882. The address of Colonel 
Parker, of the Cook County Normal School, Illinois, entitled ‘‘ Learning to do by 
doing,” was listened to with much interest. He said that one advantage of these 
associations was the inspiration given and received ; teachers would discover a won- 
derful unity in their work ; what we call new isreally very old. He showed the ways 
in which thought may be expressed and the advantage of originality or self activity, 
and closed by saying that character should be made the aim of all education. A 
system of school savings banks was discussed at length, but without leading appar- 
ently to any definite conclusion. President Klinefelter, in his official address, sug- 
gested “that four weeks of attendance on institutes be compulsory as to teachers 
holding second and third grade certificates, and that teachers be allowed pay while 
attending institutes; that the work of rural districts be concentrated on a few essen- 
tials, and that elementary didactics be made a study to be taught at the request of 
pupils of a certain age.” Addresses and papers followed on “‘An outsider’s view of 
what is lacking in our public schools,” ‘The money value of a college education,” 
“ What constitutes a practical education,” ‘School government,” “What can rea- 
sonably be expected from the schools,” and ‘ Addition to and subtraction from our 
education.” The last subject was a discussion of spelling reform, classics vs. sci- 
ence, morals in the schools, &c. A special feature of the meeting was the presence of 
most of the college presidents and many of the members of the faculties. A new 
constitution was adopted at the beginning of the session.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics given in the biennial report of the State superintendent, though in- 
dicating fair progress since 1882, are to some extent imperfect, as of 6,706 organized 
districts in 1884 579 failed to report, of which number 440 are said to have had no 
school. While this shows neglect of duty by some district officers, the statistics indi- 
cate efficient school work in the main. While the percentage of enrolment to school 
population fell off, that of average attendance to enrolment and of average attend- 
ance to school youth materially advanced. : 
The superintendent says that the weakness of the school system lies in the inde- 
pendent districts. The number failing to support schools in 1880 was 367; in 1582, 
411; in 1884, 440, or 1 district in every 15. He suggests two remedies: (1) That the 
State, by general tax, afford such support as will give at least 3 months’ school in
-P-A-G-E-363
    KANSAS, 91 
every district, such tax to be divided, not on population, but by giving each district 
a stated sum, say, $75, and coupling this appropriation with a requirement that a 
similar amount as a minimum be raised by the distriet; (2) organize the State on the 
township plan. In this way taxes would be equalized and every community would 
be provided with at least some term of school, as contemplated by the constitution of 
the State. Some limit, it is thought, should also be put to the power of county officers 
to form districts that cannot perform their functions. 
The school term for the two years has averaged in the State but twenty-three weeks. 
The superintendent urges that, as the State grows in wealth, there should be a cor- 
responding increase in the length of term till it reaches nine months a year. 5 
There has been a gratifying improvement in the supervision of schvols, as the re- 
sult of the law of 1+b1 requiring visitation and inspection of schools by county officers. 
This is seen in the large increase of attendance, as already indicated. The standard 
of teaching has also been raised during this period, under the influence of normal 
schools, normal institutes, county associations, county superintendency, and examin- 
ing boards.! 
The figures in regard to school buildings show a marked advance in good new 
buildings, these in many cases taking the place of old ones less suitable to the need 
of the district, 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For the State and county there is a superintendent of public instruction elected 
biennially by the people; for school districts, a board of 3 members elected for 3 years, 
with annual change of 1. For examining applicants for State diplomas there is a 
State board of education; for examining teachers in counties there are associated 
with the county superintendent 2 holders of first grade certificates, each to serve 1 
year; for the care of the State school funds there is a board of commissioners, con- 
sisting of the State superintendent, secretary of state, and attorney general. Women 
may vote and hold school offices. 
The pane system embraces primary, grammar, high, and normal schools, a State 
Agricultural College, a State university, and schools for the deaf and dumb, for the 
blind, and a reform school. No sectarian teaching is allowed in any of these, but the 
reading of the Bible without note or comment is not prohibited. For the improve- 
ment of teachers annual county institutes are provided for, supported by an appro- 
priation not to exceed $100 to each one, made by the board of county commissioners, 
and by funds received from those attending and those examined for certificates. 
These certificates are of first, second, and third grades, and continue in force 2 
years, 1 year, and 6imonths. Teachers are required to report to county superin- 
tendents and they to the State superintendent. The State treasurer is also required 
to report semiannually to the State superintendent the amount of school money in 
the treasury subject to disbursement. Uniformity in text books is required. All pub- 
lic schools are free to children from 5 to 21 years of age, and those from 8 to 14 are 
by law required to attend at least 12 weeks in each year, unless excused by school 
authorities or taught elsewhere. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are supported from the proceeds of all lands granted by the 
United States, including 500,000 acres given to new States under act of September 4, 
1841, and also sections 16 and 36 in every township, granted by act of January 29, 
1861; from estates of those dying without heir or will; from such per cent. as may 
be granted by Congress on the sale of lands in the State; from a yearly tax of 1 mill 
on $1; and from an annual fee of $50 paid by every insurance company doing business 
in the State. This income is distributed annually, by order of the State superintend- 
ent, to the county treasurers, and thence to the district treasurers, in proportion to 
the children and youth of school age (5-21). For the support of a State university, 
72 sections of land were reserved. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The only changes in school laws that have been noted since the last report are 
(1) a permission to boards of education in cities of the second class to raise their annual 
school tax levy from 8 mills on $1 to 10 mills; (2) a permission to boards of directors 
in cities of the third class to raise the limitation regarding bonds issued to erect or 
purchase school-houses from 5 to 6 per cent. of the taxable property. 
  
1 The committee on education of the Kansas State Grange, in its report for 1884, holds that in the 
district schools there is still too much memorizing, too many studies requiring abstract reasoning, and too much straining of the powers of pupils by study of rules and principles beyond their grasp. In place of this it urges that there should be more object teaching, acquainting children with the 
forms and modes of life around them and life in atta can throughout the world; that the study of * 
numbers should be in connection with familiar objects of definite dimensions and with materials that 
enter into domestic economy ; that quickness and accuracy should be induced by exercise in practical 
computations relating to such objects; and that in such exercises this study should be confined to the 
primary grades.

ADMINISTRATION, 
Cities of more than 15,000 inhabitants have elective boards of education of 3 mem- 
bers from each ward, with annual change of 1; cities with from 1,500 to 2,000 have

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Lawrence in 1882~83, with an increase of 242 in school population, shows no addi- 
tion to its school rooms, now numbering 25, in 10 buildings. Of these, 3 rooms were 
oceupied by the high school, 5 by the grammar, and 17 by the primary schools. The 
accommodations were insufficient, the average daily attendance being far in excess 
of the seating capacity of the rooms. The board decided to add 2 rooms to one of 
the school buildings, thus giving some relief. 
Leavenworth in 1882~83 inereased its school buildings to meet an increase of 554 in 
school population, affording 2,500 sittings. There was an outlay of $584 to supply 
the new buildings with furniture and apparatus, with an advance of $11,600 in 
value of school property, it being $189,600 as against $178,000 the year before, There 
was an increase of 191 in enrolment and of 45 in average daily attendance. The 8 
schools are classed as prim ary, grammar, and high, the high and primary having 
each a course of 4 years and the grammar one of 3. 
Topeka in 1882-’83 reported 12 school buildings, with 3,248 sittings, valued, with 
other property, at $176,900. There was an increase of 637 in enrolment and of 482 
in average daily attendance over the previous year. This, with an increase of 1,329 
in school population, called for the employment of from 6 to 10 more teachers (the 
number given being 50) and a large addition to the school rooms, including 2 new 
buildings. Schools are classed as primary, grammar, and high, the last having a 
course of three years. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
In this State no person may teach in the public schools without a diploma or cer- 
tificate from the State board of education,! from a county board of examiners (of whom 
the county superintendent is the chairman), or from the examining committee of a 
city board of education. The diploma of the State board is valid in any county, city, 
town, or school district in the State during the lifetime of the holder, unless revoked 
by the board. Its certificates are valid in like manner for 3 years or 5 years, according 
to grade, unless revoked. Those from county boards are good only in the county in’ 
which they are issued and for a term of 2 years, 1 year, or 6 months, according to 
the ascertained qualifications of the holders. Those of city examining committees 
hold usually during good behavior.   
1A diploma from the State Normal School has nearly the force of a State diploma; a certificate of 
graduation from the normal department of the State university, about that of a State certificate.
-P-A-G-E-365
KANSAS, 93 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State Normal School, Emporia, in its report for 1883~84, shows a faculty of 11 
instructors, with an attendance of 534, of whom 283 were in the normal department. 
There were 35 graduates, of whom 32 engaged in teaching. The full course covers 4 
years, 3 of them academic, the other professional. There is also a model school for 
practice. Candidates for admission must pass a fair examination in the common 
‘branches and present satisfactory evidence of good moral character. No one is ad- 
mitted to the professional year who has not completed the academic work of one of 
the courses. Children between the ages of 4 and 8 are admitted to the model school 
and preparatory course, in which the lowest grade is a Kindergarten department. 
To graduate, a student must reach an average of 80 per cent. in a final examination 
and must have taught in the preparatory and model school at least 20 weeks. The 
diploma granted is by law a life certificate to teach in the schools of the State. There 
is a library of 1,600 volumes. The appropriation by the State and the income from 
endowment amounted to $15,000. In the second year’s work there were 26 teachers, 
of from 2 to 11 years’ experience, who had left salaries of from $50 to $80 a month to 
take the advanced English and Latin course. 
The normal department of the University of Kansas, Lawrence, shows 3 courses, 
classical, modern literature, and English, each of 3 years. Its certificate of gradu- 
ation authorizes the holder to teach in the common schools of the State without fur- 
ther examination. In 1884 there were 64 students and 14 graduates from its 3-year 
course. It received from the State $1,500. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Kansas Normal College, Fort Scott, reports for 1883-84 391 students and 11 
teachers. The ‘teachers’ class” numbered 58 men and 51 women. 
The Kansas Normal School and Business Institute, Paola, prepares for teaching in a 
3-year course. ‘The special feature of this school is its training department, in which 
are enrolled several hundred children in eight grades and a model district school. 
The Campbell Normal University, Holton, in 1882-83, had among its 7 courses one 
of 5 terms, of apparently 10 weeks each, in which it aims to meet the demand for 
trained teachers. The course shows fair academic studies, including a training class. 
Diplomas are granted to those who satisfactorily complete the course. Students, 10. 
Both sexes are admitted on equal terms. 
Normal departments appear in 1883~84 at the Atchison Institute, Atchison, and at 
the Freedmen’s Academy of Kansas, Dunlap. Total attendance at the former, 306; at 
the latter, 175, without distinction of normal students in either. 
Salina Normal University, Salina, was to open September 2, 1884, and to offer with 
other courses a teachers’ course not yet defined. Women are to be admitted on equal 
terms with men. 
NORMAL INSTITUTES, 
Institutes for the instruction of teachers and those desiring to teach are required 
to be held by the county superintendents in their respective counties for a term not 
Jess than 4 weeks, 2 or more counties uniting in sparsely settled portions of the State 
to hold an institute. 
In 1883 there were 74 institutes held, with an enrolment of 6,770, at an expense of 
$21,075, of which $3,700 were from the State and $17,375 from local funds. In 1884 
there were 78 institutes, enrolling 6,956: a gain of 4 in institutes, of 186 in attendance, 
and a corresponding increase in expenditure. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Educationist, published at Emporia by a former State superintendent of public 
instruction in Indiana, George W. Hoss, continues to be the official organ of public 
instruction and the chief medium for the diffusion of educational information through- 
out the State. The Industrialist, published weekly at Manhattan, is the organ of 
the Kansas Agricultural and Mechanical College and is devoted specially to industrial 
education. The former was in its sixth volume in 1884; the latter in its tenth. To 
these may, perhaps, be added The University Register, organ of the Normal University, 
Salina, published quarterly and devoted to practical education, the first number of 
which was issued June, 1834. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
By authority of the board of regents of the State university, any high school adopt- 
ing a prescribed course of study is “recognized” by the university and applicants 
for admission to its freshman class from such schools are admitted without examina- 
tion. The number thus authorized in 1883 was17. Others are said to be contem- 
plating an early adoption of this plan.
-P-A-G-E-366
      
94 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Of the schools thus authorized, the bigh school in Lawrence had an attendance of

In the University of Kansas four departments are organized: (1) science, literature, 
and art, (2) elementary instruction, (3) law, and (4) normal training. The first de- 
partment comprises a general scientific, a Latin-scientific, three special scientific, a 
classical, and a modern literature coarse. There are also an optional course of 2 years; 
a music course of 4 years; a graduate course of 3 years; and a preparatory medical 
course of 1 year, which, by an arrangement with the leading medical schools of the 
West, is to be counted the first year of a regular 3-year medical course. For other 
courses, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, below. Faculty in 1883-’84, 17; 
students, 521, or 61 fewer than in 1882~83. 
For the other collegiate institutions reporting in 1883~84, see Table IX of the ap- 
pendix ; and for a summary of the same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
All show preparatory courses, mainly of 2 and 8 years, and classical courses of 4 
years. For their scientific courses, see Scientific, below, and for normal courses, 
see Table III of the appendix. St. Benedict’s, St. Mary’s, and Washburn Colleges show 
commercial courses; St. Benedict’s and St. Mary’s Colleges, Baker and Highland Uni- 
versities, musical training; St. Benedict’s and Lane University, ministerial instruc- 
tion; while Washburn College offers a ladies’ course of 4 years. All but St. Benedict’s 
and St. Mary’s admit both sexes, 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN, 
The College of the Sisters of Bethany, Topeka (Protestant Episcopal), is the only 
school of this class reporting in 188384. Its schedule of studies embraces a Kinder- 
garten and a primary department, a preparatory course, a collegiate department of 
3 years, with courses in instrumental music, vocalization, drawing, painting, elocu- 
tion, French, and German. It bad 24 instructors and assistants in 1843~84, with 334 
students, a gain of 75 over 1881~82,, For other statistics, see Table VIII of appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, continued to offer a general scientific, a Latin~ 
scientific, and three special scientific courses in chemistry, natural history, and civil 
and topographical engineering, each of 4 years and leading to the degree of bachelor 
of science, in which were 67 students in 1883~84, 
The State Agricultural College, Manhattan, had in 1883~84 an endowment fund of 
$474,305. The last legislature appropriated $20,000 to finish the main college build- 
ing and it was approaching completion. The college has shared in the general pros- 
perity of the State, the inventory of its.property having within the last 2 years grown 
from $109,109 to $145,858 and attendance from 312 to 395. The 4-year general course 
in agriculture and science, offered to both sexes, involves industrial training, to which 
each student is required to devote at least one houra day. Young men may take 
farming, gardening, fruit growing, carpentry, cabinet making, iron work, printing, 
or telegraphy; young women, sewing, printing, telegraphy, floriculture, or music. 
Special and graduate courses are also provided. Military drill is optional. Each 
winter a series of 6 farmers’ institutes is held in as many counties, in which the fac- 
ulty meet with the people in discussions on topics looking to the improvement of 
farming. The degree of bachelor of science is conferred on those who complete the 
full course of 4 years and sustain all the examinations. Instructors in all the depart- 
ments in 1883~84, 21; students, 395, of whom 135 were females; graduates, 17. The 
library contains over 5,010 volumes, f ig 
Of the 7 collegiate institutions, Baker, Highland, Lane, and Ottawa Universities’ 
and Washburn College show scientific courses of 4 years each.

KANSAS, 95 
  The Kansas Theological School, Topeka (Protestant Episcopal), continued its 3- 
year course, which by the canons of the church is ordinarily to be prepared for by a 
collegiate course or its equivalent. There appears to have been in 1882~83 but 1can- 
didate and 1 ordination. 
Law.—The law department of the University of Kansas aims to furnish a complete 
course of legal training covering 2 annua! terms of 7 months each. The degree of 
LL. B. is conferred upon such members of the senior class as shall be recommended 
by the examining committee and faculty and approved by the board of regents. 
Medicine.—The preparatory medical course of the University of Kansas, covering 
2 terms of 20 weeks each, has been accepted by the leading medical colleges of 
the West as the first year of a 3-year course, and students passing examination in 
these classes are admitted to the second year in the colleges on the certificate of the 
faculty of this institution. For professional students, a full collegiate course is 
recommended, Students in 1882-83, 7. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION, 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB, 
The Kansaa Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Olathe, under the 
care of the State board of charities, reported for 1882~83 10 instructors, 2 being semi- 
mutes, and 190 inmates, 88 of whom were females. Sixteen completed their course of 
instruction in the year and were honorably discharged. 
Since opening in 1861, 369 had been instructed, each one having spent in the insti- 
tution an average of 5 years. They were taught the common branches, the method 
of instruction being the manual and articulation combined, The employments for 
boys were Renting, cabinet work, and shoemaking; for girls,, needlework. There 
was a library of 500 volumes. The grounds, buildings, and apparatus, including a 
ae of 177 acres, were valued at $60,000, State appropriation, $24,000; expended, 
22,974, 
The enrolment for 1883~84 was 160, of whom 1 was granted an honorable dis- 
charge at her own request, having completed 5 years of study, and 4 received diplo- 
mas, having spent their full allotted time in school and passed creditable examina- 
tions. Expenditures for the 2 years, about $55,000; estimated value of property 
$96,554, . 
: EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The State Institution for the Education of the Blind, Wyandotte, for 1883-84 
reports 19 instructors, 3 blind employés, and 72 inmates, having instructed 186 since 
opening, in 1867. The boys are employed in broom and brush making and chair 
caning; the girls, generally in machine and hand sewing, but in some cases they also 
made brooms and chair seats successfully. In school they are taught the common 
branches, as well as algebra, rhetoric, civil government, and American literature. 
Special attention is given to vocal and instrumental music, A library of 500 volumes 
was increased 50 during the year. Grounds, buildings, and apparatus were valued at 
$100,000, State appropriation, $13,900. Enrolment for 1882~83, 69, with an average 
attendance of 65; for 1883-84, enrolment, 75; average attendance, 71. Expenditure 
for the 2 years, $29,683, : 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The State Reform School, Topeka, was opened in June, 1881, and reported June, 
1882, an enrolment of 72, The second biennial report from July, 1882, to June, 1884, 
shows 109 admitted, 9 escaped, 8 returned, and 59 discharged, leaving 100 present. 
Average number present, 1832~83, 76; 188384, 95. Their time was divided between 
farm work and study, giving training for the hands as well as discipline for the men- 
tal faculties. In school, they are classed in 3 grades and are said to make fair progress, 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
General information on this point is wanting, but from an unofiicial source it is 
learned that a, building for an Indian school at Lawrence was in course of construc- 
tion in 1883~’34, in which, when completed, instruction in practical industries was to 
be united with literary training. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-fourth annual session of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Topeka, December 26-28, 1883. The attendance was 400. On the evening of the 26th 
the president elect, Prof. F, A. Fitzpatrick, delivered an address on the “ Educational 
lessons of the year,” followed on the 27th by a paper on “Theory versus practice in, 
country schools,” showing that most of the work in the country schools is without

system and that if teachers have good theories they very often fail in practice. 
Papers on “The high school question,’ ‘The teacher and politics,” ‘‘The relation 
of academic and professional work in institutes,” and ‘County uniformity in text 
books” were followed by an address on ‘‘The present status of the profession,” 
which closed the day. The last day of the session was opened by a discussion of 
“County uniformity in text books,” at the close of which a resolution was introduced 
asking the next legislature to provide for such uniformity, and, as a means to this end, 
an early adoption of the township system. Chancellor J. A. Lippincott, of the State 
university, then read a paper on “ The public school and its relation to the formation 
of character,” in which high ground was taken in favorof moral training and of 
christian character instead of mere intellectual culture. He emphasized the fact that 
learning is no certain pledge of purity, that culture alone does not secure right char- 
acter. ‘A resolution recommended that the county normal institutes should be graded 
in a course of study providing for promotion and certificates of graduation on com- 
pletion of the course, each to be equivalent to a first grade certificate. Another res- 
olution, asking that the county superintendents be required to hold preliminary 
examinations as a condition precedent to enrolment in the county institutes, was 
referred to the State board of education. 
In connection with papers on ‘‘ Drawing” and ‘ An education to the useful,” speci- 
mens of drawing work were presented from the State university, State Agricultural 
College, State Normal School, Bethany College, and several others, which elicited 
much interest. Senator Ingalls gave the closing address on ‘Garfield ;” when, the of- 
ficers for the ensuing year having been elected and the usual resolutions passed, the 
association adjourned to meet at Topeka, December, 1884. 
SUPERINTENDENTS’ CONVENTION. 
The State convention of county superintendents met at Junction City, June 5, 
1883, and after completing a permanent organization, in which the State superintend- 
ent was made permanent president, discussed, among other topics, ‘‘ Township ver- 
sus the district system” and ‘‘ Normal institutes.” The place for the next meeting 
was made the same as that of the State Teachers’ Association and the time within 
the same week. Accordingly, on December 28, about thirty superintendents met 
at Topeka, Supt. J.H.Lee in the chair. Mr. Noble, of Jackson County, opened the 
discussion on “A graduating system for country schools.” He said that ho himself 
had a 4-year course and held monthly examinations to test the progress of pupils. 
Those present were in favor of the adoption of the plan and requested the State 
superintendent to prepare such a course. A paper on ‘‘ School visitation” expressed 
the opinion that lessons in telegraphy, surveying, astronomy, &c., should be given 
to awaken an enthusiasm for higher learning. 
Adjourned to meet at Emporia, June, 1884. 
  PRINCIPALS’ ASSOCIATION, 
On Friday, December 28, 1883, the principals and superintendents of town and 
city schools held their session in connection with that of the teachers’ association. 
After the annual address from the chairman, Mr. Cutler, of Fort Scott, the subject of 
“ Teachers’ meetings” was presented by J. M. Abbott, superintendent of Osage City 
schools, and that of ‘The basis of promotion” by B. 8. McFarland, of Olathe. Next

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Through the exertions of the State Superintendent the above statistics have been 
furnished in time for this report, notwithstanding the obstacles with which he had to 
contend in collecting them. In 1882~-’83 the figures show a large increase of youth of 
school age, particularly of colored youth whose increase was nearly three-fourths of 
the whole increase, which was mainly due perhaps to the fact that the school age was 
changed from 6-16 to 6-20, or the same as that for whites. The decrease in the per- 
centage of tho enrolment and of the average attendance of colored youth to those of 
school age may be attributed to the same cause. Such being the case the only feature 
that materially detracts from a year of evident advance is the extraordinary decrease 
in ie average pay of teachers, both male and female in cities, which a later report may 
explain.

  98 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For the State there is a board of education consisting of the superintendent of 
public instruction (elected by the qualified voters of the State for 4 years), the secre- 
tary of state, the attorney general, and 2 professional teachers elected by them: for 
counties, a county superintendent elected by the people for 2 years; for districts, 
boards of 3 trustees elected by the voters of each district for 3 years, with annual 
change of 1. 
The State board prepares rules for the government of the common schools of the 
State, selects and recommends a course of study, with suitable lists of text books, 
from which the trustees of districts adopt those to be used in their several districts 
for 5-year terms. 
Indigent orphan children may be supplied with text books gratis. The board has 
power to organize and keep in existence a State Teachers’ Association ; also, to cause 
to be organized and held annually 3 model State stitutes of 3 weeks each, to be 
under the care of the State superintendent and to be taught by an expert model 
teacher, with such assistants as may be necessary. 
The State superintendent must report biennially to the general assembly and may 
visit anuually different portions of the State in the interests of the schools. 
_ . No person is eligible to the office of county superintendent save upon a certificate 
from the judge of the circuit court of the county in which he resides that he has been 
publicly examined before him and that he is qualified to discharge the duties of 
county suprrintendent as required by law. f 
The county superintendent must visit at least once a year each district school in his 
county, investigate and direct the operations of the school system, condemn any 
school-house which is unfit to be occupied for the purpose of a common school, report 
to the State superintendent the census of children in his county between 6 and 20 
years of age and the required school statistics of the county, under a penalty of $200 
to $500 or imprisonment in the county jail not longer than 6 months in case of know- 
ingly and wilfully making false reports. He must also conduct or superintend the 
examinations of all offering themselves as teachers of the common schools. He must 
not give acertificate of qualification to any one whom he has not personally examined 
or who has not been examined in his presence as provided by law. For any violation 
of this rule he is liable to a fine of $20 to $50. He may suspend or remove teachers 
or trustees for cause. 
No district may include more than 100 children of school age, unless it contains a 
town or village within its limits, and none may contain less than 40, except in ex- 
treme cases, and never less than 20, 
Widows with children of schoo] age may vote at elections for district school trustees. 
These trustees must employ duly qualified teachers, and may, for cause, remove 
them, subject to approval of the county superintendent. They are to encourage the 
attendance of all the children in the district, but may forbid attendance from families 
where infectious or contagious diseases exist. They are to visit schools 5 days after 
their opening and once a month thereafter, to seo that the regulations for their gov- 
ernment are complied with, and for cause may suspend or dismiss a pupil. 
Schools for colored children must be kept separate from those for whites, in separate 
districts, and governed by colored district trustees, but under the common supervision 
of the State and county superintendents. 
The school year begins on the Ist day of July and ends on the 30th day of June; 
the school month is 20 days. 
No books, tracts, papers, catechisms, or other publications of a sectarian, infidel, 
or immoral character may be used or distributed in any common school; nor may 
any sectarian, infidel, or immoral doctrine be taught therein. 
When a pupil in any common school shall have completed the prescribed course of 
study and passed an examination before the couity board of examiners, he is to be 
entitled to a certificate to that effect, signed by the county board and indorsed by 
the State superintendent, who must affix to it his official seal. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The annual resources of the school fund are: (1) the interest at 6 per cent. on a 
bond of the State for $1,327,000; (2) dividends on 735 shares of capital stock of the 
Bank of Kentucky, representing a par value of $73,500, owned by the State; (3) in- 
terest, at 6 per cent., on a bond issued for surplus due counties by the State; (4) an 
annual State tax of 22 cents on $100 of taxable property ; (5) an annual tax of 50 
cents on each $100 of the capital of the Farmers’ Bank of Kentueky, of the Bank of 
Kentucky, of the Farmers and Drovers’ Bank, and of the Bank of Shelbyville; (6) 
all other moneys and property, taxes, fines, and forfeitures set apart by existing laws 
for common schools. The sum to be distributed is the net revenue accruing during the 
year, less expenses incurred by the State board and the incidental expenses of the 
department of public instruction, ¢
-P-A-G-E-371
KENTUCKY, 99 
The State superintendent apportions the fund in proportion to the number of chil- 
dren of school age in each county and district, as ascertained by the returns of the 
county superintendents, the money to beused only in the payment of legally qualified 
and employed teachers. 
If it be the ascertained will of the legal voters of any county to levy a county tax 
in aid of common schools, such levy is now lawful. * 
Donations, gifts, grants, or devises designed for the education of colored children in 
ihe State must be held by school officers for that purpose and expended as the law 
directs. No tax may be levied upon the property or poll or any service be required of 
any white person to aid in building or repairing a school-house for the use of colored 
children, and the same provision is made to exempt the colored people from aidiug 
the whites. : 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
The new edition of the school laws of 1884 appears in a much improved form and 
arrangement, showing such changes as were demanded by the advanced condition 
of the public schools, the most important of which are as follows: 
The school month is changed from 22 to 20 days and a section is added providing 
for graduation in the common schools, as before noted. 
Article VII puts in place of county commissioners county superintendents, who, as 
before noted, must be examined by the county judge. ‘These superintendents, in 
their turn, are to examine teachers for the county, and in this, as in other duties, 
take the place of the former county commissioners, the only change being in the mode 
of compensation. 
In Article VII, which provides for “ reforming and laying off districts,” sections are 
added defining the area of the new district and the number of children to be included. 
Half time and third time schools are authorized and the officers are named who may 
order the proposed change. > 
Section 8 of Article VIII authorizes an annual poll tax of $2 for incidental expenses 
in place of 50 cents in the law of 1882. 
To section 7 of Article 1X is added a clause providing for the renewal of a 5-year 
State certificate held by a teacher without another examination. 
In section 1 of Article X, providing for an annual teachers’ institute, the time for 
such session is made to be between the Ist of July and the Ist of September, the old 
law leaving it indefinite. In section 2 the minimum time of the session is made 4 
days instead of 6 days, the maximum in the old law. Section 3 isso amended that 
if there is a surplus arising from the examination fee of $2 the fee shall be reduced, 
instead of using it for libraries. Sections 5 and 6, providing for special institute teach- 
ers and specifying the subjects to be discussed, are added. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS, 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For cities and towns there are boards of trustees, who appoint city superintendents, 
Some cities, under special charters, have boards for the examination of teachers,

  ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Covington presents for 188283 and 1883-84 no statistics beyond 65 regular teachers 
in the latter year (including principals), 10 substitute teachers, and schools graded as 
primary, grammar, intermediate, and high, with apparently 5 ungraded schools for 
colored pupils.

buildings, with 20 rooms (one of them for recitation only) and 1,389 sittings for study$ 
21 teachers; apparently 1,014 enrolled pupils, 845 of them in average daily attend- 
ance; and a school expenditure of $9,018, Its high school course covers 4 years and 
the 3 teachers employed had 18 pupils. 
Louisville presents no printed report to indicate the details of its school work, but 
its manual for 1883~84 shows that it had, at that time, primary, secondary, interme- 
diate, and high sghools, the primary including 4 grades, the secondary and interme- 
diate each 2 grades, making 8 below the high schools, one of which, with a 4-year 
course, was for girls; the other, with a preparatory class and a 4-year course beyond 
that, was for boys, and included, in the last 2 years, studies fairly collegiate. Re- 
turns, however, for 1882-83 and 1883~84 give 27 buildings for primary, secondary, 
and intermediate schools, with 2 for the high schools and 1 for a city normal school. 
These buildings (valued, with their sites aid furniture, at $882,065 in the former year 
and at $892,936 in the latter) contained 336 rooms in the first year and 350 in the other. 
Evening schools were maintained in from 19 to 30 rooms in these years, showing con- 
siderable growth in enrolment from year to year, though the average attendance on 
evening schools comes far short of that in day schools. 
Newport, with a gain of 246 in youth of school age from 1882 to 1883, lost 208 in en- 
rolment and 278 in average daily attendance through an epidemic in the latter year, 
623 pupils being withdrawn from the schools during the year. 
For 1883-’84 no report has been received. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
Persons desiring to teach in the public schools are required to present certificates of 
qualification from State, county, or city boardsof examination. First class certificates 
are for 4 years and second class for 2 years, and no certificate except first class 
may be issued to the same person more than twice. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State makes no provision for the training of teachers other than in institutes 
which must, under the new school law of 1884, be held annually in each county for 
the normal instruction, improvement, and better qualification of teachers, and in the 
3-year normal course of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, Lexington. Teach- 
ers are required to attend such institutes in their respective counties or their certifi- 
cates will be forfeited. \ 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Louisville City Normal School is reported by the city superintendent to have had, in 
1883, under 1 teacher, 36 pupils, of whom 33 were in average daily attendance; in 
1884, again under 1 teacher, 35 pupils, 31 of them, on the average, present daily. The 
length of the normal course is not given, but the city school manual shows that it 
includes mental philosophy, theory and methods of teaching, drawing, and the sub- 
jects of study prescribed for a grammar certificate, which are spelling and definitions, 
reading, English grammar, geography, American history, mental arithmetic, written 
arithmetic, penmanship, physical geography, algebra, natural philosophy, and science 
and art of teaching, with general fitness for the office of teacher.* 
Berea College, Berea, has a spring normal institute for instruction in the theory and 
practice of teaching, and in 1882~83 some normal training was given in the Kentucky 
Normal and Theological Institute, Louisville. 
The Southern Normal Schoot and Business College, Bowling Green, offered in 1883~84 
a 48-week course of normal training, with a preparatory course of the same length. 
In the teachers’ course 98 students were reported. This course is said to be the chief 
feature of the school and shows a teaching force of 9 members; the preparatory 
“course, 7. 
Glasgow Normal School, Glasgow, with a teaching force of 11 members, presented 
preparatory and normal courses of 40 weeks each in 1882~’83, in which were 63 per- 
sons preparing for teaching. Thisschool and the preceding one show many points of 
resemblance, and the teachers are in several instances the same. 
Murray Institute, Murray, is reported by the State superintendent to have still the 
normal training noticed in 1881. He also says that such training is given in the 
Frankfort High School. 
South Kentucky College, Hopkinsville, announces a 2-year normal course for the ses- 
sion of 1884~85. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
These schools exist in the chief cities of the State, but the information respecting them 
comes irregularly and is rarely complete. In Louisville the whites have one for each 
| sex, the course in vach case coyoring 4 years; also, one for colored pupils (apparently 
   
-P-A-G-E-373
  KENTUCKY. 101 
for both sexes), its course covering 3 years. Henderson shows one with a 4-year 
course in 1882-’83. Covington, Newport, and Paducah had each 1 in 1882, the first 
with a 4-year course, the others with one of 3 years. The State superintendent says 
that there are also high schools at Bowling Green, Frankfort, Hopkinsville, and 
Maysville. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Of the 17 institutions of this class noticed in 1882, 13 make report by catalogue or 
return or both for 1883~84, namely: Georgetown College, Georgetown, and Bethel 
College, Russellville (both Baptist); Eminence College, Eminence; Kentucky Uni- 
versity, Lexington, and Kentucky Classical and Business College, North Middletown 
(all Christian); Berea College, Berea (Congregational); Kentucky Wesleyan College, 
Millersburg (Methodist); Ogden College, Bowling Green, and Kentucky Military Insti- 
tute, Farmdale (non-sectarian); Centre College, Danville, and Central University, 
Richmond (Presbyterian); St. Joseph’s College, Bardstown, and St. Mary’s College, 
St. Mary’s (Roman Catholic). 
Cecilian College, Cecilian (also Roman Catholic), has not reported since 1882, while 
Murray Institute, Murray (non-sectarian), and Concord College, New Liberty (Bap- 
tist), have long failed to report. 
Of the 14 that show signs of life, Centre College, Central University, Kentucky 
University, Georgetown College, and Ogden College indicate especial vitality in fall 
faculties, high standards, and prominence given to real collegiate work; while Ce- 
cilian College presents courses indefinite as to time and standard and St. Mary’s 
courses of comparatively low grade. 
For statistics of 1863~84, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of them, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of schools of this class reporting, see Table VIII of the appendix; for 
a summary of such statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
Of the colleges for young men or for both sexes, Berea, Eminence, and South Ken- 
tucky Colleges admit women to full privileges; Kentucky University admits them 
to its commercial department. In the list of students of the State College of Ken- 
tucky (agricultural and mechanical) there are indications of a considerable attend- 
ance of young women, without any apparent limitation as to studies and courses. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State College of Kentucky, for scientific instruction in agriculture and the me- 
chanic arts, Lexington, continued in 1882~’83 and 1883~84 its departments and courses 
in the appropriate studies of such a school, together with commercial and normal 
training for such as desired these; but in 1883~84 it more distinctly formulated its 
main studies into agricultural, scientific, and classical courses, each of 4 years, with 
preparatory courses of 2 years leading to them. The agricultural course embraces 
English, German, history and political economy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
zoology, geology, botany, astronomy, veterinary science, agriculture, horticulture, and 
shop work. The scientific has nearly the same elements, adding French to the Eng- 
lish and German and substituting mental and moral philosophy for veterinary science, 
mechanics for shop work, and optional civil engineering for agriculture and horticult- 
ure. Students, without distinction of classes or departments, 306 in 1882~83 and 226 
in 1883-84, under 16 professors and instructors. 
Of the 18 colleges before mentioned for young men or for both sexes, all show either 
scientific courses of 3 or 4 years or such intermingling of scientific instruction. with 
the English and classical as amounts to nearly the same thing; but the statistics of 
such instruction are rarely given. 
The Kentucky Military Institute, at Farmdale, showed in 1883~84 8 students in an 
engineering course, 
The Polytechnic Society of Kentucky, Louisville, incorporated in 1878, has for its 
objects, among other things, the promotion of scientific knowledge through the main- 
tenance of a free reference library, a circulating library, and popular lectures on such 
topics as the history, topography, geology, paleontology, zodlogy, botany, and min- 
eralogy of Kentucky. These lectures, delivered twice a week in 1882-’83, proved so 
interesting as to fill a room that would accommodate 500 people, many of the audience 
coming with note books. The library of over 37,000 volumes was frequented by 11,793 
lady visitors and 26,296 gentlemen, the issues of books reaching 32,027. . The member- 
ship of the society numbered 826 in 1883,

  102 | REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology, in courses of 3 years, meant to be preceded by a literary training in high 
or collegiate studies, was taught in 1882~83 and 1883-84 (1) in the Danville 
»zica] Seminary, Danville (Presbyterian), in the former year by 3 professors to 
7 siudents, in the latter by 1 professor to 1 student; (2) in Preston Park Theological 
Seminary (Roman Catholic), under 3 to 4 directors, to 16 students in each year; 
the theological department of the State University (Baptist), formerly the Kentuc! 
Normal and Theological Institute,! which, under this second title, reported 8 profe: 
ors and instructors with 15 students in 1883 and 2 professors with 20 students in Ite4, 
when the new title had been assumed and a considerable change of arrangements 
made; (4) in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, under 5 professors with 124 
students in the former year and 114 in the latter, The last 3 of these schools were in 
Louisville. 
Besides these 4, the College of the Bible, Lexington (Christian), has a 4-year course 
in study of the Bible, sacred history, church history, Christian doctrine, and biblical 
interpretation, in which course, under 3 professors, were 74 undergraduates in 18¢3 and. 
80 in 1884, The studies in this school appear to be wholly in English; in the Southern 
Baptist they are so for a part of the students. 
The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary received in 1883 about $10,000 from va- 
rious friends for endowment and in 1884 the receipt of $20,000 was reported, nearly all 
of it being from residents of Louisville. This last sum was intended mainly for the 
purchase of grounds, although a part was to go towards endowment. 
Law still continued to be taught under 1 professor, with several supplementary lect- 
urers, in an 8-month annual course, at the Louisville Schoo] of Law, the studies in 
which are meant to cover 2 years, but may be completed in 1 year. A diploma from 
this schoo] is a license to practise law. Statistics of attendance for 1682-83 and 
1e83~’84 are wanting. No other law schools appear. 
Medicine, under an “act to prevent empiricism,” was expounded and taught in 4 
schools, all at Louisville and all “regular,” namely: the medical department of the 
University of Louisville, the Kentucky School of Medicine, the Lonisville Medical 
College, and the Hospital College of Medicine, which last is nominally the medical 
department of Genteal: University, Richmond, The regular annual course was in the 
first of 23 weeks’ duration ; in the second, of 20 weeks; in the 2 others, of 19 weeks. 
Attendance on at least 2 such courses, with the usual 3 years of study under a medical 
preceptor and the passage of a final examination in all the branches taught, was re- 
quired for graduation. All, in 1853-84, required evidence of literary preparation for 
medical study, except the Louisville Medical College, which was to require it in the 
autumn of 1384, 
No eclectic or homm@opathic medical schools appear to have existed in either of the 
two years indicated, nor does any dental school present itself. 
Pharmacy was tanght in both years (1) in the Louisville College of Pharmacy, first 
opened in 1871; course, 2 years of 40 weeks each year; and (2) in the Louisville School 
of Pharmacy for Women, opened March, 18*3; course, 3 years of 36 weeks each year. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education of Deaf-Mutes, Danville, gives free in- 
struction to all persons in the State between 10 and 30 years of age whose hearing is 
so imperfect as to prevent them from obtaining an education in ordinary schools. 
The institution in 1882~83 had an enrolment of 168 pupils, under 8 instructors, The 
common school branches are taught, with physiology and natural philosophy. In the 
industrial department boys are taught printing, book binding, carpentry, and garden- 
ing; the girls, sewing and general housework. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education of the Blind, Louisville, is free to State 
pupils between the ages of 6 and 18 and had 78 pupils in 1¢82~83 pursuing common 
school branches. In addition to the literary course special attention is given to in- 
dustrial training and music. The employments taught are chair caning, broom and 
mattress making, sewing, knitting,and mending. A Kindergarten is maintained with 
great success. 
          
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education and Training of Feeble-Minded Chil- 
dren, Frankfort, reports the usual good progress of the pupils in their school studies, 
Those under training in mechanical and other useful employments made satisfactory 
advance, the progress in shop work deserving and receiving special commendation. 
This school received from the trustees of the John F. Slater fund $1,000 in aid of its work, but it 
gets ne appropriation from the State. |

KENTUCKY. 103 
INSTRUCTION OF ORPHANS. 
Against 9 institutions of this class reporting for 1882, 11 present some form of report 
for 1ss3-’e4. In all, instruction was given in the elementary English branches and 
in such employments as would facilitate self support. All present statistics of attend- 
ance, making a total of 902 inmates. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Louisville House of Refuge undertakes the reformation, education, and indus- 
trial training of its inmates in its 3 departments, 1 for white boys, 1 for white girls, 
and 1 for colored boys. All'were taught the common school branches, with the in- 
dustries of cane seating, shoemaking, gardening, and farming for boys; for girls, sew- 
ing, laundry work, and general housekeeping. During the year 1833~84 there were 
355 youth under instruction and training, of whom 189 were white boys, 63 white 
girls, and 103 colored boys. 
The Mission Industrial School, Lexington, and the House of the Good Shepherd, New- 
port, are engaged in a similar work for girls; the former, which is unsectarian, reports 
120 inmates in 1883~84 ; the latter, under Roman Catholic influence, 76, 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
KENTUCKY STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twentieth annual session of this body was held at Louisville December 26-28, 
1883, with Supt. 8. A. Chambers, of Henderson, as president, and R. H. Carothers, of 
Louisville, as secretary. The principal topics of discussion appear to have been ‘ Mis- 
takes in teaching caused by erroneous theories,” by Hon. J. M. Brown, of Louisville; 
“Hygienic instruction in public schools,” by Dr. J. N. McCormick, secretary of the 
State board of health; ‘‘ Methods of teaching reading,” by Mrs. Anna Randall Diehl, of 
Washington, D.C.; ‘Moral instruction in public schools,” by C. H. Dietrich, of Hop- 
kinsville, and ‘Public instruction,” by Rev. H. A. I. Hobbs, who advocated national 
aid to public schools. A paper on ‘Recent advances in electricity,” by Dr. H. W. 
Eaton, of the Louisville High School, also awakened interest. A committee on reso- 
lutions reported, asking the State to make liberal appropriations for a normal depart- 
ment at the State Agricultural and Mechanical College, and to provide one or more 
normal schools; requested the legislature to make instruction in hygiene a part of 
the course in public schools, and advised the passage of a law requiring candidates 
for the office of county superiutendent to hold certificates from the State board of 
education, 
CONVENTION OF EDUCATIONISTS, 
An important educational convention met at Frankfort April 5, 1883. It is said to 
have been the most influential gathering ever assembled at that place, being com- 
peed of representative men, including a fiveral attendance of colored people. Judge 
ullock, of Louisville, was called to tie chair and addressed the convention at some 
length on the design and working of the public school system, its defects, and means 
of improving it. He then retired and Judge Beckner took the chair. The first topic 
taken up was ‘‘ School supervision; how school commissioners should be chosen: their 
qualifications, their jurisdiction, and duties.” This was discussed at length, developing 
wide difference of views, On motion of Judge Beckner a committee of 9 was appointed, 
with power to call conventions, to appoint committees, and to provide for the full 
organization of the forces in Kentucky that favor education, so as to make them more 
efiective, this committee to be known as the State central committee; also, a com- 
mitiee of one from each congressional district, to be known as the State executive 
committee, to advise with and assist the other committee in perfecting and conducting 
said organization, both to be charged with the duty of agitating the question of edu- 
cation until there is in Kentucky what the people need. This was followed by a 
discussion on changes in school laws, school ages, adjustment of school year to the 
fiscal year, and abolition of distinctions between white and colored citizens in assess- 
ments and levy of taxes or fines forschool purposes. In the course of the discussion the 
qnestion of compulsory education came up, but did not seem to be well received, some 
approving and some opposing. ° 
The topic of ‘‘The maintenance of the system of State aid and local taxation—aid 
from the General Government,” was then taken up, and Mr. Woodson is said to have 
read an able paper, followed by an address from Mr. Albert 8. Willis, which, after the 
passage of resolutions advocating national aid to education, finished the work of the 
convention.

a Ten parishes, answering to counties elsewhero, report no statistics whatever for 1883, and those of New Orleans are not included, but may be found under City School System, further on. b Twenty-seven parishes make no report of private schools. ¢ Tho inierest on the nominal school fund has been largely diverted to seminaries and colleges. 
(From report of Hon. Edwin H. Fay, State superintendent of public education, for 
the former year of the two above indicated, and from figures furnished by his suc- 
cessor, Hon. Warren Easton, for the latter year.) 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
. GENERAL CONDITION. 
Superintendent Fay, reporting for 1882 and 1883, says that he is compelled to pre- 
sent incomplete information, as several of the, parish secretaries had failed to re- 
port to him and he had no authority to compel them to make reports. Partly from 
this cause, partly from diversion of school funds by the legislature to collegiate in-, 
stitutions, and partly also, it would seem, from want of any general interest in edu- 
cation, the statistics are not encouraging. Enrolment in public schools had gone 
down from 68,440 in 1880 to 59,491 in 1882, a decrease of 8,949, while average attend- 
ance had declined from 45,626 to 40,828 in the same time, a decrease of 4,798; for, 
although public schools reported had increased in these three years, the means forthe
-P-A-G-E-377

support of them had fallen from $480,520 to $300,000 and the expenditure upon them 
from $411,858 to $179,052, teachers in them decreasing by 746. 
It must be understood that these figures are exclusive of those for the parish of Or- 
leans, the city of New Orleans reporting for the calendar year, not for the State school 
year. Taking in its figuresfor 1483, we add 53 to the number of public schools, 380 to 
the teachers employed, 21,641 to the pupils enrolled, 13,794 to the average attendance, 
and considerably increase the average time of school. But here also, as may be seen 
under the head of ‘‘ New Orleans,” below, the decline above noticed had been alsc 
going forward since 1879. 
The statistics furnished by Superintendent Easton for 1883, not including New 
Orleans, show something of the same downward tendency, but not at so many points, 
enrolment in the public schools falling off by 3,653: 777 more whites, but 4,430 fewer 
colored; while average daily attendance was 2,213 less. 
The outlook for the future has at least one strong feature of encouragement in the 
fact that many prominent citizens of New Orleans and other places have formed an 
association to stimulate interest in education and draw forth from the legislature 
larger means for the support of schools. The State superintendent will, consequently, 
not work single handed, as for some years past, but will have a support that, it may 
be hoped, will enable him to resist successfully attempts to use the school funds for 
other purposes than the support of public free schools; he will also be helped, in 
other ways, to make these schools as effective as they should be. 
Encouragen ent is also drawn from the fuct that the legislature which met in May, 
184, increased the State appropriation for public schools from 1 to 14 mills, which, it 
is supposed, will add about $100,000 to the school revenue. It also stopped the diver- 
sion of the school fund to collegiate purposes, which will much increase the means 
available for the support of State schools. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The State school system is administered by a State board of education, composed 
of the governor and other chief officers of the State, with two citizens appointed by 
the governor for 4-year terms. A State superintendent of public education, elected 
by the people for a like term, is ex officio a member of this board and its executive 
officer, reporting to it annually. The board has power to make regulations for the 
government of the free public schools and to select, every 4 years, the text books 
for use in them. Parishes, answering to counties elsewhere, have, with one excep- 
tion,! each, 5 to 9 directors of public schools, appointed by the State board for 4-year 
terms, and may each have a superintendent of the parish schools, with an auxiliary 
visiting trustee (or trustees) for each ward or school district, chosen by the parish 
board. To any of these school offices women are eligible; but, outside of New Orleans, 
there is no pay attached to such office in parishes, except for the parish superintend- 
ent, who, for the double functions of superintendent and secretary of parish board, 
may have, at the utmost, $200 annually, or, af another section of the same act says, 
$100. No school of less than 10 pupils may be opened, nor may more than 40 pupils 
be placed in charge of any one teacher. Denominational schools may not partake of 
public funds. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
‘The means for the education of the children of the State between the ages of 6 and 
18 come (1) from 4 per cent. interest on a nominal State fund of $1,130,867, to be paid 
annually to each parish in proportion to the number of children of school age ; (2) 
from a poll tax of $1 to $1.50 on each voter, retained in the parish where it is raised ; 
(8) from a State tax not to exceed 14 mill on $1; and (4) from a local levy of 2 mills on 
$1, which any parish may order. 
PEABODY FUND AID. 
The agent of the Peabody fund trustees in 1883 gave $1,000 to improve the public 
schools through teachers’ institutes ; $100 for the same purpose, by assisting the Loui- 
siana Educational Journal; and $1,025 for the fuller preparation of 7 selected teachers 
from the State at the Southern Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. 
In 1884 the amounts from the same source were $1,300 for institutes, $100 for the 
Journal, and $1,245 for Louisiana normal students at Nashville. 
For aid from the fund rendered in the latter year, but not to the State, see Superior 
Instruction, further on. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
NEW ORLEANS. 
Officers.— The public schools of this city are under a board of 20 directors, 8 of whom 
are appointed by the State board of education and 12 by the board of administra- 
tors of the city, with a superintendent appointed by the directors. The board has 
for many years employed an experienced superintendent for the schools.   
o 1 The one exception is the parish of Orleans, for which see City School System.
-P-A-G-E-378
  106 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Statistics.— Population of the city by United States census of 1880, 216,090; children 
of school age, by the same census, 61,456; enrolled in the 53 public schools in the cal- 
endar year 1883, under 390 teachers, 21,641; average daily attendance tor the year, 
43,794; length of school sessions for the year, 134 days; expenditure for publio 
schools in 1883, $206,386. 
These statistics, compared with those of 1862, show a decrease of 3,335 in enrol- 
ment, of 1,430 in average daily attendance, of 12 in teachers, of 53 days in length of 
school term, and of $72,930 in the expenditure of the city for its schools. Since 1879 
there had been a total decline of 6,515 in enrolment, largely from lack of sufficient 
appropriations for the maintenance of the schoolsystem. In consequence of this lack, 
there was a recess of 5 months, instead of the usual 24 months, in 1883, aud even then 
at the close of the year’s session in December a deficiency of about $13,000 existed, 
which, in May, 1884, was still due the teachers and other employés. 
Statistics for 1834 relate, as do the former, to the whole calendar year, and therefore 
extend beyond the date of this report. They show, on the whole, very nearly the 
same general condition of school affairs in the city as that above noted, the increase 
of appropriation for all school purposes being only $23,614 beyond that of the previ- 
ous year, with an entire dependence on the McDonogh fund for school sites and 
school buildings, about $80,000 coming from this source for 3 buildings, 
Additional particulars.— The decrease in attendance of colored pupils is said to be 
partly due to the number of private and parochial schools established by the colored. 
people in their own churches er by the aid of northern societies and partly to the 
fact that 1 or 2 of the 4 universities in the city for the education of the colored people 
draw largely from the primary and grammar departments of the pubtic schools. 
As for the cause of the general decline, especially during the last 2 years, the super- 
intendent says that, ‘‘ while the demand for popular education has increased, the 
school opportunities have been more and more dimiuished. The policy has been one 
of depression, when expansion was required. Schools have been closed when they 
should have been opened. Revenues have been reduced when the necessity was 
greatest for their increase. Our city appropriations have been less than in any for- 
mer period of the schools, and aid has been reduced to its minimum.” 
As respects school-houses, the city has been liberally aided from the McDonogh 
fund. Rented school rooms, heretofore a necessity, have been for some years giving 
way to fine school buildings erected by means of this fund. Of the 42 school-houses 
owned by the city, 17 are McDonogh buildings, and 6 more were in course of erection. 
The New Orleans Teachers’ Assuciation, organized during the year for mutual im- 
provement and efficiency in school work, is said to have been satisfactory in the 
increase of membership and results in the public schools. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS WOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
No person may be employed to teach in the public schools of this State without a 
certificate from the special committee of the parish board to examine teachers, show- 
ing scholastic qualifications and moral fitness for the teacher’s vocation. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
From 1861 to 1884 Louisiana has had no normal school under State auspices to train 
teachers for effective work. Two in the city of New Orleans have been maintained 
through allowances from the Peabody trustees, and several benevolent associations 
have aided colored people in fairly preparing themselves for good teaching; but aid 
from the State has been long sought, andalmostin vain. The first efficient step toward 
such aid was taken at the fepisiaticd session of 1884, when an appropriation of $6,000 
was made for the establishment of a State normal school in the city or town that 
should offer the greatest inducements in the way of money and buildings. Natchi- 
toches is understood to have bid highest for it, offering a large property formerly oc- 
cupied by a Convent of the Sacred Heart, with about 30 acres of ground, and thus has 
apparently secured the school. Mr. Edward E. Sheib, of the Maryland State Normal 
School, is said to have been made president. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Peabody Normal Seminary,? New Orleans, for white teachers, in 188384 had a 
2-year course of 42 weeks each, 2 resident instructors, and 12 female normal students ; 
a class of 3 graduated and engaged in teaching. It has a library of 800 volumes (390 
being pedagogical), a school of practice, and an anuual fee of $40.50 for tuition, Since 
its organization in 1870 the school has graduated 250, many of whom are employed in 
the city schools, 
1 That is, in proportion to population to be provided for. 2 Both the Peabody schools, having lost their previous allowance from the Peabody fund because the

The Peabody Normal Schaol,! New Orleans, for colored teachers, shows in 1883~84 a 
8-year course of 40 weeks each, 1 resident instructor, 10 female normal students, a 
graduating class of 8, a library of 41 volumes (20 being pedagogical), the discontinu- 
ance of its model school since 1881, and an annual charge of $20 for tuition. During 
the 6 years of its existence this school has furnished 50 teachers for colored schools ia 
the State. 
Straight University, New Orleans, for colored, continued in 1882~’83 and in 1883~84 
its 4-year normal course, the 2 first years being elementary, the other 2 for higher 
studies. Regular teachers’ classes are formed, where students from the normal depart- 
ment obtain practical experience in the primary grades, under trained teachers. Stu- 
dents in 1882-83, 73; in 1883~"84, 29. 
Leland University, New Orleans (Baptist), and New Orleans University (Methodist 
Episcopal), had in 1882~83 normal courses; that of the former, 3 years; of the latter, 
indefinite. The former reported 39 normal students; the latter, 25. 
The normal department of Southern University, New Orleans, simply aims to supple- 
ment ordinary scholarship with lectures on the principles of teaching and discipline 
and with instruction in practical class work and government; no students appear to 
be enrolled in it as yet. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Through $1,300 aid from the Peabody fund in 1883 State Superintendent Fay em- 
ployed Dr. A. R. Hone, of Allentown, Pa., a celebrated conductor of teachers’ insti- 
tutes, and with him, travelling through many parishes, held 74 sessions of such insti- 
tutes, arousing, it is said, an enthusiasm on the subject of education such as was never 
before seen in the State. In every parish visited the teachers agreed to organize par- 
ish teachers’ associations, giving in their names as evidence of their intention. This 
good work was continued for 6 weeks. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Louisiana Journal of Education, in its fifth and sixth volumes in 1883 and 1884, 
continued to be the principal medium of educational suggestion and information for 
the State, and gave much matter of general usefulness, ‘The editors were Robert M. 
Lusher, former State superintendent, and Superintendent W. O. Rogers, of New Or- 
leans, and they did excellent service. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The only high schools reported in the Scate as connected with city systems are the 2 
in New Orleans, 1 for boys, the other for girls, each having a 3-year course with a fair 
English curriculum, including French. The former, with a total roll of 80, an aver- 
age one of 74, and an average attendance of 64, under 4 teachers, had been removed to 
one of the grammar school buildings, with better surroundings, but inferior accommo- 
dations. The latter had a total roll of 180, an average one of 14%, and an average 
daily attendance of 138, under 5 regular teachers, with a special teacher in music paid 
by the pupils. For the last 3 years classes have been admitted to it upon an in- 
creased standard of qualifications. This school was suffering from want of a better 
building, which the board had no means of providing, and the only hope for both 
schools was fromthe next distribution of the McDonogh fund. 
The superintendent says that no part of the public school system has felt the press- 
ure of economy more seriously than the high schools, which for many years have done 
important service in the education of the youth of the city,

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
The Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, 
non-sectarian, continued in 1882~83 and 1883-84 its classical and scientific courses of 
4 years each, with agricultural and mechanical courses of 2 yearseach. ‘The classical 
course shows a fair collegiate standard, while in the scientific course German is sub-

stituted for Greek and a larger proportion of mathematics for less of Latin, botany and 
zodlogy being included. These courses are believed to offer a collegiate education 
adapted to the needs of the young men of Louisiana, as they lead to the degree of 
bachelor of arts and bachelor of science, while briefer courses lead to those of grad- 
uate in agriculture and graduate in science, for which, see Scientific and Professional 
Instruction, below. There was a library of 17,000 volumes; income from productive 
funds, $14,000; State appropriation, $10,000. 
The University of Louisiana, New Orleans (non-sectarian), continued in 1882~83 
and 1883~84 its academic, medical, and law departments. Though it has a recom- 
mended course of study in the first of these, the instruction is given in schools of Latin, 
Greek, English, French, German, Spanish, mathematics, physics and astronomy, and 
chemistry. The parent or guardian, with advice from the faculty, chooses the branches 
to be pursued by a student, his cast of mind and proposed future vocation having due 
weight in the selection. In any course chosen 2 to 4 schools must be taken, and the 
student is advised to study with a view to the attainment of the degree of a. B., 
LIT. B., or B. 8., each of which requires 4 years of specified studies. There is a high 
school to prepare students for the academical department. Every boy is required to 
study at least English, mathematics, and any 2 of the following languages: Latin, 
Greek, French, German, Spanish. A commercial course is open to students of the 
academic department. In the ion of 1882~'83 Mr. Paul Tulane gave the university, 
for the perpetual use of this department, a large and substantial building adjacent to 
the other university buildings, to be known as Tulane Hall. A library of about 7,000 
volumes was increased by 500 during 1883-84. 
The Southern University, New Orleans (non-sectarian), organized in 1883 for the ed- 
ucation of colored people and supported by the State, reports for 1883~84 a total of 
419 students, all in elementary or preparatory classes. 
In addition to the above State colleges, the following report for 1882~83 in some 
form: Centenary College, Jackson (Methodist Episcopal South); Immaculate Con- 
ception, New Orleans (Roman Catholic) ; Jefferson College, St. Mary’s (Roman Cath- 
olic); Leland University, New Orleans (Baptist); New Orleans University (Method- 
ist); Straight University, New Orleans (Congregational). 
To Tulane University, Mr. Paul Tulane, of Princeton, N. J., formerly of New Or- 
leans, donated in 1882 property in New Orleans taxed as worth $300,000 and having a 
much higher monetary value.- The gift was made for the promotion and encourage- 
ment of intellectual, moral, and industrial education of white youth in New Orleans 
and for the advancement of learning and letters, arts, and sciences. This fund was 
committed to a board of administrators, with Hon. William Preston Johnson as ex- 
ecutive officer. In his report of June 4, i883, to the board, he says that nothing 
Jess than a university on a very broad foundation was included in the scope of Mr. 
Tulane’s plan and that the resolution of the board to establish such an institution 
met with his unqualified approval. It is proposed that when fully in operation the 
university assume and maintain the primacy and leadership of public school educa- 
tion in the State. The announcement of its full equipment and opening will be 
awaited with interest. 
For full statistics of these colleges, see Table IX of the appendix, and a summary 
of the same in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
New Orleans, Leland, and Straight Universities, 3 Protestant institutions at New 
Orleans, continue to give equal privileges to young women. For information rela- _ 
tive to schools exclusively for such, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific course proper of the State university covers 4 years; the agricultural 
and mechanical courses, each 2 years. These latter, consequently, embrace only about 
half the amount of study required for a degree in the full university courses. The 
agricultural course is intended especially for those who expect to devote themselves 
to the industrial arts or agriculture, with special reference to cultivation and handling 
of cotton, sugar, and rice. In the place of laboratories, the cotton fields, sugar houses, 
oil mills, gins, &c., are open to the students under competent direction and instruction, 
In the mechanical course instruction is carried through analytical and descriptive 
geometry, with a short course of engineering.’ Full courses in drawing are given, 
from elementary free hand to architectural and mechanical, and a workshop on the 
grounds is supplied with the necessary benches, tools, and other apparatus for exer- 
cises in the practical arts to which such training naturally leads, such as wood work- 
ing, pattern making, and manipulation of iron or other metals. 
The University of Louisiana, New Orleans, kept up its schools of physics and chem- 
istry, as well as the school of astronomy. Courses in this last, 1 year; in each of the 
others, 2 years. The chemistry of sugar making received especial attention,

: . LOUISIANA, 109 
Centenary College, Jackson, in 1882~’83, continued its 4-year scientific course, and 
the College of the Immaculate Conception, New Orleans, gave evidence in the same year 
of very fair attention to natural philosophy and physics. 
For statistics,see Table X of appendix and a corresponding table in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. ' 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.— Leland, New Orleans, and Straight Universities (Baptist, Methodist 
Episcopal, and Congregational), all in New Orleans and all for the colored race, con- 
tinue their instruction in exegetical, historical, systematic, and practical theology, the 
courses in them being meant to cover 3 years beyond an academic or collegiate train- 
ing, but often necessarily modified to meet the needs of special cases. Leland, for in- 
stance, combines with its regular theological course a special and briefer one for 
pastors already in the field. Straight does essentially the same, and so probably does 
New Orleans. 
In the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans appears in 1882~83 a theological 
seminary, with 1 professor and 2 students. 
Law.— The law departments of Straight University (for colored students) and the 
University of Louisiana (for whites), both at New Orleans, have each 2-year courses 
in legal studies, but the annual term in the former reaches only from November to 
March; that of the latter, from November to May. Law faculty at Straight, 5; at 
the University of Louisiana, 4. Students at the former in 1882-83, 20; in 1883~84, 
49, 6 graduating ; at the latter, 1882~83, 21; 188384, 20. 
Medicine.— A law of the State requires that before any person be allowed to practise 
medicine or surgery he must make affidavit, before a legally qualified officer in the 
parish where he resides, that he has received the degree of M. D. from a regularly 
incorporated medical institution of respectable standing in America or Europe, this 
standing to be evidenced by the indorsement of the State board of health and signed 
by the secretary. Holders of diplomas from schools known to have conferred degrees 
after only one course of lectures must certify in their affidavit that they have at- 
tended not less than 2 full courses and passed a final examination. 
‘The medical department of the University of Louisiana shows, for 1883-84, a fac- 
ulty of 8 professors; a 3-year graded course recommended, but not required; for grad- 
uation, 3 years of study, 2 complete courses of lectures of 19 weeks each, 2 of dis- 
section, a thesis, and the passage of a satisfactory examination. 
The medical departments of New Orleans and Straight Universities, both for colored 
students and open to males and females, have offered medical instruction, but, in 
the opinion of the Illinois State board of health, have not given such courses as to 
qualify men or women to practise medicine, and their diplomas, if given, could not 
be recognized. The offer of medical instruction, probably on this account, does not 
appear in the catalogues of these institutions in 1882~’83 or 1883~84. 
For statistics of the above professional schools, reference is made to Tables XI, XII, 
and XIII of the appendix, and summaries of these in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND TIE BLIND. 
The biennial report of the Louisiana Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Baton 
Rouge, for 1882~83 and 1883~84 shows 56 different inmates during tho 2 years and 
40 for the last session. The school, with 4 graded classes, under 2 teachers and 2 moni- 
tors, had done well. The articulation method, though not yet introduced, it was 
hoped, would be reached soon. In the direction of industries there was a beginning: 
5 boys were learning to print and 3 were practising the use of carpenters’ tools. The 
girls are taught sewing and fancy work and the duties incident to housekeeping. 
very department is said to be suffering from want of means to enlarge and repair the 
building, to furnish workshops and tools and a suitable library. 
The biennial report of the Louisiana Institution for the Blind, Baton Rouge, for the 2 
years 1882 and 1883, gives 4 instructors and 31 persons, including pupils and inmates 
of the Industrial Home, a department of the institution provided for the training of 
adult blind. Of the 470 white blind in the State at least 50 under 30 years of age 
should be provided for, but the report says that there are not proper accommodations 
for those in attendance, school, shop, and family work having been done under great 
disadvantages. Of those who have gone out during the last 5 years, several are 
maintaining themselves and others are helpful at their homes. A full quota of books 
from the American House at Louisville had been received. No provision is made for 
the 326 colored blind in the State. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Statistics of the 8 or more institutions for these classes of children, which usually 
combine moral, industrial, and literary training as a preparation for life work, may 
be found in Table XXII of the appendix to this report.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
LOUISIANA EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY. 
This organization, formed to promote public education in Louisiana, was incorpo- 
rated in March, 1884, and in the succeeding session of the legislature, May to July of 
that year, used its influence with that body so efficiently as to secure the passage of 
a bill appropriating $6,000 for the establishment of a State normal school in the town 
or city that should offer the highest inducements in money and buildings. It is be- 
lieved to have also effected at the same session an increase of the State tax levy for 
its schools from 1 mill to 14 mills, and at the last accounts, which reach beyond the 
date for the close of this report, was engaged in other work ooking to the formation 
of auxiliary associations throughout the State for the promotion of its great general 
aim. 
  STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
In the summer of 1884, at Minden, a meeting of teachers from various parts of tho 
State, onthe first annual session of the Louisiana Educational Society, unanimously re- 
solved to proceed to the organization of a State Teachers’ Association, to be composed of 
members engaged in teaching or directly connected with education in the State. Mr. 
William O. Rogers, long superintendent, of city schools in New Orleans, was elected 
ermanent president; an executive committee, with State Superintendent Easton at 
its head, was chosen; and resolutions were passed calling for a meeting at New Or- 
leans at such time as the executive committee should designate, and requesting all 
teachers of the State to put themselves in correspondence with the secretary, Mr. J. 
E. Seaman, of the New Orleans High School for Boys.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
For the second time in 14 years there appears in the report for 1882~83 an increase in 
the number of children of school age, instead of a decrease. Superintendent Luce 
hoped that the tide which had so long flowed downward was on the turn, But 1883~84 
again shows a decline, with a corresponding decline in the enrolment in public 
schools, Still the average attendance was fair in 1882~83 and better in 1883~84. 
There was also encouragement in the increase of expenditure for schools, school- 
houses and appliances, and supervision. For such purposes there was paid in 1882~83 
$26,327 more than in the previous year, 1883~84 going still further and showing a 
total expenditure of $39,373 beyond that of 1882~s83. in the higher class of towns, 
where a township system has been adopted, an improved educational condition hag 
resulted from the increased expenditure. But the superintendent says that in others, 
where the “ wasteful, inefficient, and inequitable district system” etill prevails, ‘toe  
-P-A-G-E-384
  112 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
large a portion of it is wickedly wasted, and is barren of returns.” Henco ‘‘schools 
in which are registered nearly two-thirds of aH attending in the State are open less 
than 5 months in the year, and probably those in which a third of all are to get their 
education are open less than 4months.” And this period of scheol terms seems to be 
steadily falling, the average time in 1880 being 120 days; in 1881, 118; in 1882, 117; 
in 1883, 116, and in 1884, 114. The highest of these figures is below the average of 
the better class of States, and the fact that Maine is thus steadily descending in 
the scale of school terms suggests the inquiry whether the district system, which is 
largely responsible for it, cannot be overthrown, as it has been in other States, and 
the more effective township system be adopted in its place, as has been often recom- 
mended in reports from this State. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For general control of the system there is a State superintendent of common schools, 
appointed triennially by the governor and council; for each town (i. e., township), a 
superintending school committee of 3 members, chosen by the town at its first annual 
meeting, with subsequent yearly change of 1; or else a supervisor of schools, chosen 
in the same way, apparently each year. Women are eligible to these offices. For 
each school district in a town that has been divided into districts there is a school 
agent, chosen either by the town or by the district at its annual meeting, to look 
after the schools. He also acts as district census taker. City school officers may be 
found under the head of City School Systems, further on. 
Every city, town, and plantation may raise money to provide school books for the 
pupils in its public schools free of charge for use or furnish them at cost to pupils. 
Annual provision for free instruction in industrial drawing may be made, too, in towns 
and cities for persons over 15 years of age, in either day or evening schools. Compul- 
sory attendance on some school for at least 12 weeks in each year isa part of the 
school Jaw requirements, unless pupils are excused from such attendance by the 
proper school officers. 
Besides the ordinary schools, provision is made for high schools, aided by the State, 
in towns that have raised and expended the annual 80 cents for each inhabitant, for 
which, see Secondary Instruction, further on. Graded schools are also provided for, 
as well as normal schools, a school for the deaf, and reformatory schools. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are sustained from the interest of a permanent State school 
fund, from a tax on banks, from a 1-mill tax on each $1 of taxable property, and 
from a local tax of not less than 80 cents on each inhabitant. The proceeds of the 
first three mentioned are distributed among the several towns according to the num- 
ber of children in each between 4 and 21 years of age. The last mentioned is retained 
in the towns where it is raised and goes towards the support of the public schools 
therein. Failure to raise this involves forfeiture of from twice to four times the 
amount of deficiency, and also a forfeiture of the town’s share of the State school 
fund for the year. 
There may also be, as has been stated, local taxes to purchase books for the public 
schools, such books to be either sold to the scholars at cost or loaned without charge 
except for abuse or injury. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The only change of school Jaw indicated in 1883 was one making the time for re- 
porting the statistics of free high schools June 1, instead of December 1, as in the 
case of the common schools. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The cities of Auburn, Lewiston, and Portland have each a school superintendent, 
apparently elected by the school committee of each city. Each town has a school 
supervisor or a superintending school committee and a school agent, as noted before 
under State School System. The school committee ordinarily examines and employs 
teachers; directs the general course of instruction; selects a uniform system of text 
books; visits the schools, inquiring into their discipline and the proficiency of schol- 
ars; expels the disorderly after proper examination, and excludes any not vaccinated, 
when deemed expedient. The school agent provides fuel for the schools, makes repairs 
on school buildings, and reports to the assessors and school committee the children 
of school age in his town or district,

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Auburn began the year 1882-83 under a new charter, providing that only one-half of 
the school board shall be elected or retained in any one year, and also with the ap- 
pointment of a superintendent of schools. The schools numbered 19 rural, 11 primary, 
5 grammar, and 1 high, in 32 school buildings. The superintendent improved the 
grading of the schools. The primary schools, under teachers well trained to their 
work, had come to be regarded as ‘‘ foundation schools,” the grammar schools main- 
tained their previous good standing, while the high school is reported as one of the 
best of its kind in the State. The school board, believing discrimination against pri- 
mary teachers to be unjust, endeavored to make the pay of each accord with the 
quality of the work done. The returns show only 50 per cent. of the school popula- 
tion enrolled for the year. 
In 1883-’84 public school enrolment somewhat improved and average attendance 
was considerably better, though less was spent for school purposes. 
Augusta shows in 1883 an advance of 101 in school youth over 1882, and in 1884 one 
of 59, enrolment, average attendance, and teachers in public schools also all ad- 
vancing for both years, with an expenditure for school purposes considerably higher. 
The value of public school property, however, was rated in 1883 $17,000 less than in 
1882, though the school-houses numbered 3 more. 
Bangor for 188384 reports 35 school buildings, with 74 rooms and 3,626 sittings. 
Entire school property, $150,000. Of86 teachers employed, 83 were women. School 
year, 216 days. No private or parochial schools were reported, The public schools 
enrolled only 56 per cent. of the school population. They are suburban, primary, inter- 
mediate, grammar, and high, the last two having each a course of four years. ‘The 
condition of the schools is said to be most gratifying. The school buildings received 
needed repairs, with improvements in ventilation and relief from overcrowding. Sal- 
aries of intermediate, primary, and suburban teachers were increased 50 centsa week. 
With a slight decrease in enrolment there was an increase of 3 in teachers and of 
$4,060 in expenditures as compared with 1882~83. 
Bath in 138384 had 15 school buildings, valued, with other property, at $97,000. 
‘The public schools are primary, grammar, and high, each having a course of four 
years, and two suburban schools, with no specified course. Of the 36 teachers 32 
were women. The statistics, compared with 1882~83, show a falling off in children 
of school age and in enrolment and a slight increase in expenditure. School year, 
207 days. Fifty were enrolled in private and parochial schools. Heretofore written 
<aminations have been required for advancement from thé grammar to the high 
school, but all that is now demanded is work the teacher deems satisfactory. In the 
primary schools progress was made toward the modern methods of teaching. Cards 
are sent by the teachers to the parents of pupils who are habitually idle or disorderly 
and in danger of being disciplined or dropped. A regular course of manual training 
in the industrial arts is urged as affording the best exercise in physical culture,

114 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Biddeford shows a decline of 148 in school population in 1883, but a recovery in 1884, 
with considerable fluctuations in other items, as is not uncommon in manufacturing 
towns. Its school property, rated at $95,000 in 1882, is given as only $61,500 in 1884. 
The schools reported in 1884 are 12 rural, 20 city primary, 5 intermediate, 2 gram- 
mar, andl high. Besides these, an evening school was maintained 4 nights a week, 
from November 19 to March 14, with 3 regular teachers and 4 occasional assistants, 
all of whom generously worked without pay. The city schools were housed in 10 build- 
ings, with from 1 to 7 rooms each and with 1,488 seats. The rural schools, 11 innum- 
ber, had each only 1 room. Including 125 in the evening school the total registration 
was 1,590, as stated in the preceding table, in addition to which a Roman Catholic 
parochial school had 450 from 7 to 12 years of age. But even this left 2,281 children 
of school age not in school. 
Lewiston in 1882~83 had 29 school-houses of all grades, valued, with other school 
property, at $179,500. The schools are rural, primary, intermediate, grammar, and 
igh. The average daily attendance was up to that of the previous year, while there 
was an increase of 198 in enrolment and of $2,225 in expenditure. One special 
teacher in music was employed. Special schools for factory children are recom- 
mended, the irregularity of their attendance rendering it impossible for them to main- 
tain a standing in the graded schools. Ungraded schools have not been kept up since 
18:0, nor evening schools since 1882. School-houses are reported excellent in condi- 
tion, and it was recommended that their grounds be ornamented with shade trees. 
During the year the superintendent made 496 visits to the different schools; the 
school board, 181; parents and other citizens, 1,749. 
In 1883~84 there was some advance on the preceting: year in school youth, enrol- 
ment, and average attendance in public schools, as well as in teachers employed, but 
the expenditure for schools was less than in 1882. 
Portland in 1883~84 had 15 school buildings (1 less than in 1882) for its 23 public 
schools, consisting of 1 high, 7 grammar, 13 primary, 1 ungraded, and 1 for deaf pupils, 
the last 3 having a course of 6 years ; the others, of 4 years each. While in school popu- 
lation, number of school-houses, and schools there was no change from 1882~’83, there 
was an increase of 230 in enrolment, of 4 in teachers, of $4,690 in expenditures, and of 
171 in average daily attendance. Of the 145 teachers employed, 12 were in the high 
school, 36 in the grammar, 95 in the primary and ungraded schools and that for the 
deaf, with 2 special teachers for penmanship, drawing, and music. More than half 
the teachers have had special training for their work, while the others have earned 
an equal standing by long experience. Most of them are residents of the city, thus 
securing a good degree of permanency. The condition of the school-houses is reported 
as becoming annually more satisfactory, important additions and repairs having been 
made during the year. Good progress is said to have been made in all branches of 
school work. Adding 1,300 enrolled in private and parochial schools, 70 per cent, of 
the enumeration were in school. 
Rockland, in 1883~84, had, as in 1882-83, 11 buildings, valued, with other school 
property, at $41,100, and 25 schools: 1 high, 3 grammar, 8 intermediate, 12 primary, 
and 1 mixed. There was an increase of 256 in enumeration and one of $1,019 in ex- 
enditure, with a decrease of 186 in enrolment. To meet the increase in school popu- 
tition one new building was called for and one or more besides to take the place of 
poor ones in the northern part of the city. The high school room had been furnished 
with new desks, seats, and blackboards, and important repairs were made on one other 
school-house during the year. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES, 
These are satisfactory evidence of good moral character, a suitable temper and 
capacity for government, and the passage of an examination in the common school 
branches, including book-keeping and physiology. 
No one may teach a district school without a certificate from the superintending 
school committee of the town indicating compliance with these requirements, and no 
certificate is valid for more than one year without the approval of this committee 
annually indorsed thereon, 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State appropriates popnally $19,000 towards the support of normal schools at 
Castine, Farmington, Gorham, and the Training School for the Madawaska Territory, 
in 1883 adding $2,500 for repairs. For 1883-84 the 3 normal schools had an attendance 
of 418, graduating 86, 83 of whom Sparse in teaching. 
The Madawaska Training School held 2 sessions of 20 weeks each, one at Fort Kent, 
the other at Grand Isle, with a total attendance of 126, of whom 88 were normal stu- 
dents. Teachers are here trained for the schools in the French towns, and, under the 
care of Vetal Cyr, 8.s., this school is said to be in a high degree. effective, having

graduated 28 teachers since its organization in 1878, including the class of 12 sent out in March, 1834, 
The normal department of Maine Central Institute, at Pittsfield, reported, for 
1882~83, an attendance of 25 pupils, and for 188384, 85, Seven pupils were gradu- 
ated in June, 1884, 
The Normal Training and Practice Class, Portland, continued in 1883-84 to train can- 
didates for the profession of teaching, especially for the primary schools, thus fur- nishing, as needed, teachers for the city schools. During the year 10 young ladies attended, 7 of whom graduated and began to teach. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
In 1882~’83 there was! 1 of these in every county in the State, except Sagadahoc, 
while in Oxford and in Washington there were 2, all enrolling an aggregate mem- 
bership of about 2,000. During 1882 and 1853 there were held 47 meetings, of 2 days 
each, at 47 different places, showing, it is said, a constant gain in work and interest. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
FREE HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The original law for this class of schools, enacted in 1873, required the final annual 
reports from them to be presented on or before December 1. This took them out of 
correspondence with the other schools, whose final reports were to be presented June 
1. It also caused some months of delay in the publication of the general school sta- 
tistics, as those of the high schools had to be waited for long after those of the common 
schools were in, To remedy this an act of January, 1883, so changed the rule as to 
require the annual returns of free high schools to be made June 1, like the others, 
This made the report of them for 1882~s3 present the statistics of only half a year, and 
that half the one in which the smallest number are usually in session. Even thus, 
however, there were shown 87 towns having such schools, with an enrolmentsof 
5,908 pupils, an average attendance of 4,850, and an average session of 16.26 weeks, © 
Fuller returns for the year 1882~’83 give a total of 109 towns with free high schools, 
held for 236 terms, with an enrolment of 10,374 pupils and an average attendance of 
6,708, of whom from 1,288 to 4,362 were in ordinary studies, 2,337 in ancient languages, 
853 in modern languages, 3,070 in natural sciences, 3,229 in higher mathematics, 1,334 
in book-keeping ; expense for these schools in the year, $88,372. 
In 1883-34 there were 123 towns with free high schools, held for 285 terms, with 
9,757 pupils and an average attendance of 7,733, from 1,78 to 6,042 of them in ordi- 
nary studies, 2,212 in ancient languages, 637 in modern languages, 3,286 in natural 
sciences, 3,432 in higher mathematics, 1,621 in book-keeping; expense for this instruc- 
tion in the year, $99,373. 
These high schools, besides training a higher class of pupils for a wider range of 
work, repay the State for its share of their support by preparing teachers for the 
schools of all classes below collegiate. Of the 10,374 pupils registered in high schools 
for 1882~83 thero were 571 who either taught in the intervals of study or were in- 
tending to teach when they should be prepared for doing so; and, of the 9,757 regis- 
tered in 1883-84, 782 either taught in that year or were expecting to teach, 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools preparing 
students for college, see Tables 1V, VI, and VII of the appendix, For a summary of 
those statistics, see like tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION, 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Bowdoin College, Brunswick (Congregational), reported for 1883~84 an academic 
faculty of 14. Its president, Joshua L, Chamberlain, LL. D., having resigned, 
Professor Packard in the mean time was acting president. No material changes 
appear in its classical 4-year course, which still allowed, in the junior and senior 
years, a wide range of elective studies. Facilities are provided for graduate instruc- 
tion for those who wish to continue their studies beyond the regular course with or 
without reference to a degree. Special students may study by themselves or enter 
the regular classes without becoming matriculated members of college. In 1883-’84 
the different libraries contained 38,000 volumes, an increase of about 500 during the 
year. Collegiate students in 1882-83, 149; in 1883~84, 108, a decrease of 41. 
Bates College, Lewiston (Free Will Baptist), in the same years had a faculty of 
10; its usual 4-year classical course, open to women on equal terms with men; 10 
State scholarships, giving free tuition to 10 students, with a preference for the children 
of those who fell in defence of their country; 13 others, founded by individual dona- 
tions of $1,000 each, 1 being for a lady student; and libraries containing in 1882~83
-P-A-G-E-388
  116 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
10,683 volumes and in 188384 11,373, a gain of 4,490 since 1881~’82, Collegiate 
students in 1883~84, 115, a gain of 9 in 2 years. 
Colby University, Waterville (Baptist), had also in the same years a faculty of 10; had 
a classical course of 4 years, with a preparatory department consisting of 3 academies 
in different parts of the State, under the control of the university ; admitted women 
on equal terms with men; gave some attention to the study of French and German 
and more to the natural sciences ; permitted students to be absent for teaching 8 
weeks, without loss of college time; allowed persons of suitable age and attainments 
to take a partial course of not less than a year; had 69 scholarships and a library of 
18,800 volumes, increased by over 1,000 during the 2 years, Students in 1882~83, 124; 
in 1883~84, 117. 
During 1883~84 the sum of $29,593 in cash was received on account of the academy 
fund at Colby, making, with $77,166 heretofore received, $106,758 as the total of this 
fund. The college also received bequests amounting to $72,615, of which $70,000 were 
from the estate of Gardner Colby, Newton, Mass., and $1,115 from that of Cotton 
Brown, Sangerville, Me. Bates College received during the same year a total of 
$8,281.76, of which $4,000 were from the late Chase Lewis, esq., of Providence, R. L., 
and $1,000 from Richard W. Shapleigh, esq., of Boston, Mass., the remainder being 
given in small sums by various friends. Bowdoin College reports a gift of $1,000 
from Mrs. Hannah A. Ludwig, Thomaston, Me., for founding two scholarships. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSrRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of this class of institutions, see Table VIII of the appendix; fora sum- 
mary of the same, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Orono, reports for 1883~84 9 
resident professors and instructors and 76 students (of whom 4 were women) in its full 
course of 4 years. It had a library of 4,200 volumes, property valued at $150,000, and 
a productive fund of $129,300, yielding an annual income of $7,678, which, with $6,500 
from the State and $2,000 from tuition, gave an income from the year of $16,178. Atthe 
commencement in 1884 4 young men and 2 young ladies received the degree of B. 8.; 
5 young men, that of B. C. E.; 1, that of B. M. E.; 2, that of c.B.; 1, that of M.s. A 
set of standard weights and measures was given by the General Government and 
$220 were received from Hon. A. Coburn for increase of library and prizes. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.—Bangor Theological Seminary, Bangor (Congregational), for 1883-84, 
had a faculty of 5 professors and instructors, with 23 students in its regular course of 
3 years, 1 resident licentiate, and 2 special students. Candidates are admitted on 
examination, and must present evidence of church membership, of a collegiate edu- 
cation, or of such attainments as shall be satisfactory to the faculty. By a recent 
donation of $1,500 a graduate course of 1 year at Bowdoin College is secured to any 
graduate of this seminary. 
The Bates Theological School, Lewiston (Free Will Baptist), a department of Bates 
College, admits on examination, a college education not being required, though pre- 
ferred ; it had in 1882~83 and in 1883-84 a faculty of 5, and 2,200 volumes, already 
reported, in its library. In the former year there were 18 students and in the latter 19. 
Medical.—The Medical School of Maine, Brunswick, a department of Bowdoin Col- 
lege, for 1882~83 and 1883~84 reported 9 professors and lecturers, a library of 4,000 
volumes, and, respectively, 104 and 94 students. The required examinations for ad- 
mission and graduation remained the same as heretofore reported. 
The Portland School for Medical Instruction, with 10 professors and 2 terms of 16 
weeks each annually, continued to afford medical students facilities for obtaining a 
higher grade of preparatory and professional instruction than can usually be given 
by a single professor. It graduates no students and confers no degrees. The course 
comprises daily recitations, lectures, and demonstrations, clinical instruction, and 
practical anatomy. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The State Reform School, for boys, Portland, reporting for the year ending November 
31, 1883, 142 inmates, received 32 and discharged 37, leaving for the beginning of 
1883~84 105. The common English branches, including book-keeping and vocal music, 
were taught in school. The industries were baking, cane seating, carpentry, farming, 
gardening, tailoring, house and laundry work, and knitting. On leaving, some are in- 
ntured till of age, others released on probation, and both are required to report every 
3 months till finally discharged. The superintendent says that nearly all allowed to 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
    MAINE, dy 
go out on trial were doing well. Under direction of the legislature, with an appro- 
priation of $5,000, a mechanical school was organized; a shop, furnished with tools, 
was erected, and instruction in the use of carpenters’ tools was begun. The trustees 
favor the family plan and hope soon to be allowed to adopt it. 
The Maine’ Industrial School for Girls, Hallowell, under the management of a pri- 
vate corporation, is designed as a refuge for girls aged 7-15 who are in danger of 
becoming outcasts. It is not a place of punishment, but a home for friendless, neg- 
lected, and vagrant children, where, under the influence of kind treatment and 
physical and moral training, they may be fitted for lives of usefulness. The State, 
which is represented on the board of managers by the governor, the secretary of state, 
and the superintendent of common schools, aids:in the support of the institution. 
The report for 1883-’84 shows an average of 47 under instruction, 17 committed during 
the year, 16 sent to homes, and 3returned. Of 181 received since 1875 there had been 
148 sent to homes, of whom 38 were returned to the school, 82 remaining in homes; 
18 were married before reaching majority ; 7 were returned to friends; and only 4 dis- 
missed as incorrigible. The facts thus far indicate that fully 80 per cent. of pupils 
instructed in this school will grow up to lives of usefulness and respectability. They 
are taught the common school branches, sewing, and housework. An additional 
building for the home, which had been greatly needed for some time, was begun in 
the spring or summer of 1884; funds for the purpose to the amount of $5,000 were 
received trom friends, chiefly ladies. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
MAINE PEDAGOGICAL SOCIETY. 
The Maine Pedagogical Society held its fourth annual meeting at Lewiston, Oc- 
tober 11-13, 1883, President L. G. Jordan inthe chair. The large attendance included 
300 teachers and the leading educators of the State. 
In a paper on “Moral instruction,” being the report of a committee, prepared by 
M. C. Fernald, an outline sketch was given of the points of the subject. It was 
held that in the lower grades of schools piyenuiee should be taken of all opportune 
occasions for impressing moral ideas, while in the higher there should be morning 
talks, appeals to honor, right, justice, &c. A teacher, it was held, must be a con- 
stant moral force. 
Under the head of “Educational outlook,” Ex-Superintendent Corthell then main- 
tained that there are indications of progress: that educators are building on a solid 
foundation; that farmers are awaking to the fact that brains are to win on the farm 
as elsewhere and are demanding a better education for their sons and daughters; that 
a course of study adapted to the common schools is demanded, also better teachers; 
that even in the rural districts there were calls for better school work; while, largely 
throughout the State, there is a growing sentiment in the same direction. 
Of the ‘‘Study of arithmetic in common schools,” it was said by Principal C. C. 
Rounds that this should be taught mainly in its application to business and practi- 
cal science. Square and cube root should be reserved for higher courses. Memoriz- 
ing what is not understood should be condemned. Computation should be taught 
by itself and accuracy secured by special exercises. 
A paper on ‘Securing the codperation of parents,” by Superintendent Tash, of 
Portland, is said to have been full of common sense and wise suggestions as to the 
means of accomplishing this end. In a talk on “The art of questioning,” Superin- 
tendent Abner J. Phipps, of Lewiston, condemned the old methods of teaching by 
text books only, and a combination of this with questions which might stimulate 
the pupil to think and draw out his knowledge was advised, while it was said that 
leading questions should be discountenanced ; that teaching questions should be put 
slowly, testing questions rapidly; the former to be answered by a class, the latter 
by individuals. ‘The relation of the common schools to the college” was discussed. 
by Professor Chase, of Bates College, and was regarded as a vital one, to be kept dis- 
tinctly in view; being dependent on each other, their courses of study should be 
arrayed in conjunction, and as parts of one system they will flourish or fall together. 
The “Study of geometry” was urged for its mental discipline, and it was said that 
preliminary training for it should begin at an early age. ‘Easy method of teaching 
science in the common schools,” as presented by A. L. Lane, of Coburn Institute, was 
regarded as one of the most interesting topics of the meetiag. An illustration of the 
cheapness of the apparatus needed for the work closed this subject and created a 
pleasing surprise. A brief outline of the educational work of Hon. Henry Barnard, of 
Hartford, Conn., was given during the evening of the second day and the discussion 
of a report on instruction in reading and writing occupied the closing hours of this 
very interesting and instructive session.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
The State board of education, in its report for 1883~84, expresses satisfaction with 
the showing of the year in most particulars, the increase in attendance corresponding 
with that in population and increase of expenditure with that in teachers and pupils. 
The smallness of gain in average attendance is accounted for by the severity of the 
winter, the bad condition of roads, and the prevalence of epidemic disease. 
Making due allowance for certain hindrances, among them the prevalence of scarlet 
fever and diphtheria in some sections, the report says there still remains considerable 
preventable absenteeism, against which the most vigorous effort of teachers and school 
Officers should be directed, :
-P-A-G-E-391
  MARYLAND. 119 
It is strongly recommended that text books be made free for the county schools, as 
they have been made in the city of Baltimore. Among the advantages of this course, 
it is claimed, would be an increase in the number of children attending school. It is 
estimated that an addition of three-fourths of a cent on $100 to the State and county 
tax would pay for this desirable improvement. 
The following changes in the school laws are suggested by the State board: (1) 
That text books be supplied without charge; (2) that the State school tax be 12 cents 
on $100 and the minimum county tax be no less; (3) that the State tax be distributed 
to the counties in proportion to the average enrolment, white and colored, no pupil 
to be counted who has not attended at least 60 days in the year; (4) that the few re- 
maining county academies be made a part of the public school system; (5) that there 
be one district trustee in place of three under the present law; (6) that all principals 
of public schools be required to report at least twice a month to their examiners; (7) 
that provision be made for ascertaining once in 2 years in the city of Baltimore and 
in the counties the number of children over 6 and under 16 years of age, the number 
of these attending public schools, and the number in private and parochial schools. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For the State there is a State board of education consisting of the governor and 4 
persons appointed by him from among the officers of the county boards, with the prin-, 
cipal of the State Normal School, who is secretary and executive officer of the board 
and ex officio State superintendent of public instruction. For counties there are 
boards of school commissioners, of 3 to 5 members, appointed for 2-year terms by the 
judges of the cireuit courts; for districts, boards of 3 trustees, chosen by the com- 
missioners. 
The schools of the State are free to all white children 6 to 21 years of age and to 
colored 6 to 20 residing in the districts where they are held, though schools for the 
two races must be separate. Provision is made for the establishment in every dis- 
trict of one school or more, according to population, for white youth; and the boards 
of county school commissioners must establish a free public school for colored children 
in each district where the average attendance is not less than 15, such schools to be 
under the direction of a special board of trustees, subject to the same laws and fur- 
nishing instruction in the same branches as the schools for white children, Theso 
studies include common English branches in all, with vocal music, drawing, physi- 
ology, domestic economy, and other higher studies when deemed expedient by the 
district trustees. County commissioners are authorized to cause the German language 
to be taught in any district if they think proper. Public schools must be taught 
for 10 months each year, if possible. County commissioners adopt the text books, 
which must contain nothing of a partisan or sectarian character. The system pro- 
vides for high schools, teachers’ institutes, and a State Normal School. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The income for support of public schools is derived from a State tax of 10 cents on 
each $100 of taxable property, levied annually, and the proceeds of real and personal 
estate granted, conveyed, devised, or bequeathed for the use of any particular county 
or school district, such grants to be exempt from all State and county taxes, 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF BALTIMORE. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The schools of Baltimore are controlled by a board of twenty school commission- 
ers, appointed by the city council for four years, five going out each year. The 
board appoints a superintendent of pnblic instruction for the city, who serves four 
years, devoting his whole time to the work; likewise, an assistant superintendent. 
STATISTICS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The population of the city of Baltimore, according to the United States Census of 
1880, was 332,313; the latest school census, taken in 1879, showed 86,961 children of 
school age (6-21). 
The city of Baltimore in 1883 had 63 public school buildings, of which 38 were for 
primary, 21 for grammar, and 4 for high schools, valued, with other school property, 
at $1,840,000. The public schools were taught 203 days, by 848 teachers, of whom 
768 were women, at a cost of $667,972; 48,876 pupils were taught, 31,601 being in 
average attendance, 
For 1884 the board of commissioners reported 67 school buildings, with 128 schools 
of all kinds, viz, the Baltimore City College, 2 female high schools, 19 male and 20 
female grammar schools, 29 male and 29 female primary schools, 5 English and Ger- 
man schools, 1 manual training school, 14 colored day schools, 4 evening schools for   
1 School census of 1879.

white and 4 for colored pupils. The total enrolment in these was 52,548, of whom 34,024 
were in average daily attendance. 
The full course in the city college, which includes the high school for boys, is 5 
years, upon the completion of which the Johns Hopkins University admits the gradu- 
. ates without furtherexamination. At the last commencement, in 1884, 14 were gradu- 
ated. There is also a 1-year commercial course, from which 56 graduated. 
In the girls’ high schools the course is 4 years; the studies include modern languages 
and other branches taught in seminaries of the higher grade for girls. 
In addition to the diplomas, the 7 highest graduates of the college and 15 highest 
of the female high schools receive prizes from the trustees of the Peabody Institute. 
Of the 67 school buildings reported, 5 were rented; the 62 owned by the city were 
valued at $1,195,811. One was built during the year and others were enlarged to 
meet the increase of population, and yet the primary and grammar schools were 
overcrowded. Baltimore builds its school-houses but two stories high, as better for 
health and easier of egress in case of panic. 
In the 4 evening schools for whites there were 20 teachers and 891 pupils, with an 
average attendance of 534, 63.4 per cent., while in the 4 for colored there were 17 
teachers and 987 enrolled, with an average attendance of 481, 55.4percent. In the 14 
schools for colored, including the high school, there were enrolled 4,910, with an aver- 
age attendance of 3,990, 83.6 per cent., under 107 teachers. 
A manual training school was opened in connection with the public schools, March, 
1884. Undertaken as an experiment, it is reported to have been eminently success- 
fal, proving that it is practicable to unite mental and manual instruction with pos- 
itive benefit to both. In object and course of study the school is similar to the 
one in connection with the Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. The course re- 
quires 3 years and differs from that of the city college in omitting from required 
studies foreign and ancient languages and in giving prominence to mechanical draw- 
ing, scientific instruction, and practice.in the use of tools in carpentry, wood turning, 
pattern making, iron chipping and filing, forge work, brazing and soldering, all al- 
ternating with the English branches of a high school course. One hour aday is spent 
in drawing, 2 hours in shop work, the remainder of the school day in study and reci- 
tation. Before graduating each pupil is required to construct a machine from draw- 
ings and patterns made by himself. The first session opened with 50 students and 
closed with 150, 
The appropriation for the city schools being only $670,000, or $15,000 below the es- 
, timate for the year, the result showed, notwithstanding the most rigid economy, a 
deficiency of $7,237, which was deducted from the salaries of the teachers, 
Mr. Charles G. Edwards, assistant superintendent of city schools, died October, 1884, 
ae profound and sincere regret in the community, and many marks of esteem 
were shown by all classes of citizens. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
There are 10 Kindergiirten in Baltimore and 1 at Embla, but they do not belong to 
the public school system. Their adoption is recommended. 
For statistics, see Table V of the appendix, and a summary thereof in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
' PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
Persons desiring to teach in the public schools must present certificates of qualifica- 
tion from the examiners of the counties in which they propose to teach or from the 
State board of education or the principal of the State Normal School. If, atthe end 
of 6 months, the examiner is satisfied of the teacher’s fitness to govern and impart in- 
siruction, he may issue a certificate for 3 years. Certificates of the first class may be 
renewed, with or without examination; but teachers with second class certificates 
“must be reéxamined at the end of 3 years. Graduates of State normal schools and 
holders of first class certificates or college diplomas who have had 7 years’ experi- 
ence in teaching (5 of them in the State) may apply to the board of education for a 
certificate, which is goodsfor life, unless annulled on account of improper conduct. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Maryland State Normal School, Baltimore, for training teachers in the sci- 
ence of education and the mode of governing schools, has a normal course covering 
3 years of 9.months each. A model school is connected with the normal, all grades, 
from primary to high, being represented. Vocal music, drawing, and calisthenics are 
taught. The school is free to 200 State students. There were 233 young women and 
20 young men, under 12 instructors, in 1882~’83; graduates, 42. In 1883~84 there 
were 22 men and 245 women students under the same number of instructors as in the 
preceding year; graduates, 42. State appropriation, $10,500,
-P-A-G-E-393
MARYLAND. 121 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Baltimore Normal School for the Education of Colored Teachers offers a course of 4 
years of 41 weeks, including in the course instruction in vocal music and map draw- 
ing. Students have the advantage of a library of 1,200 volumes. For 1883~84 there 
were 200 pupils, 35 of them in normal classes, all under 5 instructors. Graduates re- 
ceive certificates of qualification, which do not, however, legally authorize them to 
teach without further examination, although they are allowed to do so. A model 
echo! is attached to theinstitution. Graduates for the year, 3. State appropriation, 
$2,000. 
The Centenary Biblical Institute, Baltimore (Methodist), has a normal department 
(length of term undefined), in which the required studies are algebra or plane geome- 
try, natural science, theory and practice of teaching, vocal music, geography and 
history of Maryland, universal history, etymology, history of the United States and 
of the English language, with a suitable review of preparatory studies. Number of 
normal students in the institution in 1882~83, 7. 
The Theresianum, Govanstown (Roman Catholic), a training school for female teach- 
ers, reports for 1883~84 a 4-year course, with an attendance of 20 pupils, under 5 
instructors. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
The teachers’ institutes of the years 1883 and 1884 were all well attended. They 
were held in 1882~83 in the counties of Alleghany, Caroline, Carroll, Dorchester, 
Harford, Kent, Montgomery, and Talbot. Baltimore County, Cecil, and Howard have 
county teachers’ associations, which meet quarterly and keep alive the professional 
spirit of the teachers, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
High schools or high school departments are reported as existing in several counties 
of the State, no definite number being given for 1884. All the counties report pupils 
in book-keeping, algebra, philosophy, and physiology, all but 2, in geometry, while 
only 5 had pupils in drawing. In 15 counties Latin was studied by 497 students; in 
2, Greek by 30; in 1, French by 62; in 1, German by 63; in 1, music by 175. 
The State board in a revised edition of its by-laws, published at the beginning of 
the school year, states what is necessary to constitute a high. school, the law failing 
to define it or to prescribe a course for it. The schedule of primary instruction 
being divided into 6 grades, the new by-laws provide that the high school course 
shall begin with the completion of the sixth grade, and may include all studies re- 
quired for admission into the freshman class at college. No school may be classed as 
a high school unless it contains at least 3 grades higher than the sixth. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
State aid, amounting to $35,429, was yen during the year to 16 academies and 
other schools, including the Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb, which is noted 
under Special Instruction, further on. In these schools there were 44 teachers and 950 
students, of whom 16 studied Greek, 149 Latin, 49 French, 27 German, 160 algebra, 
86 geometry, 23 trigonometry, 90 natural philosophy, besides students in chemistry, 
physiology, botany, geology, logic, rhetoric, English literature, drawing, and vocal 
and instrumental music, 
For statistics of these and other secondary schools reporting, see Tables IV, VI, and 
VII of the appendix; for summaries of same, corresponding tables in report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
f COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, with high standards, has no courses of definite 
length, graduation and degrees depeniling on acquirements. It offers two distinct 
departments, collegiate and university, and had 204 students enrolled in 1882~83, of 
whom 106 were residents of Maryland, 91 being from 28 other States and 7 from for- 
eign countries. There were 125 graduate students, coming from 67 colleges and 
universities; also, 49 undergraduates, candidates for the degree of a. B., and 30 special 
students. Ten were graduated from the collegiate department and received the de- 
gree of A. B., making a total of 56 in 5 years, while 6 received the second degree of 
pit. D., making 39 in all. 
In 1883-64 the academic staff numbered 49; matriculates, 538; special students, 37; 
graduate students, 159; total students for the year, 249. This year 23 received the 
degree of a. B. and 15 that of PH. D. ' 
During 1882~83 college education in its relation to university work occupied the
-P-A-G-E-394
  122 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
attention of a ‘board of college instructors,” consisting of the president and 8 
others, who, after 20 meetings, arranged 7 courses of study, each adapted to a certain 
class of minds, combining mathematics and physical science with literature, philos- 
ophy, and history. All these courses lead to the degree of A. B., which can be gained 
in 3 years after the matriculation examination and is considered as difficult as the 
examination usually required for admission to a sophomore class. Good students 
may remain one year after completing this matriculation, thus making the curriculum 
time of this college course equal to that in other colleges. In determining his course, 
the student has the counsel of a member of the board, and, when he has once selected 
it, he may not change it for another. ‘‘Experience,” says the president, “has 
shown that we were wise in including a college department in the university organi- 
zation, The eudeavor has been to work out a plan of study adapted to the youth 
from the Baltimore City College on the one Hank and then from the private schools 
on the other. The result has been the enrolment as matriculated students of a com- 
pany of excellent scholars, whose steady intellectual growth it is a delight to watch. 
Nearly three times as many students and twice as many resident teachers were en- 
rolled in 1882~’83 as in the first year, 1876, and there was an increase on this in 
188384.” All the chief departments of investigation and instruction hitherto estab- 
lished were maintained during 1882~83, with some additions, In biology, 27 special 
lectures, besides the usual courses, were given. 
In the Latin seminary additional courses were conducted during the year. Prof. 
Paul Haupt, of the University of Gottingen, was added to the staff of instructors; 
his department will include the Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Assyrian languages. 
A gymnasium has been erected during the year. The libraries, also, received impor- 
tant accessions, making a total of 18,700 bound volumes in September, 1883. Eight- 
een honorary Hopkins scholarships, with an annual value of $250 each, have been 
instituted, to reward conspicuous merit among the undergraduates who regularly 
matriculate. 
The report of 1884 presents but few changes during the year. As the Johns Hop- 
kins Hospital approached completion much thought was devoted to the organization 
of a faculty of medicine. The first professorship established in it was one of pathology, 
and Dr. William H. Welch, of New York, was selected to fill it. Since the completion 
of the gymnasium all candidates for the degree of a. B. are required to take the course 
in physical training. Sir William Thomson, professor in the University of Glasgow, 
ave, in October, 1884, a course of eighteen lectures to the mathematical physicists 
in the university, on molecular dynamics, treating particularly of the wave theory of 
light. Professor Thomson also gave a public lecture on the rigidity of the earth. 
n concluding his report for 1883 the president expresses a great satisfaction in look- 
ing back seven years without recalling one instance of disorder among the students 
or # single breach in the harmony prevailing between the trustees and academic staff 
and the workers in the different branches of study; and he closes that of 1884 by ex- 
pressing his confidence that the foundations are firmly laid and the superstructure is 
rising quite as rapidly as is best. 
The Baltimore Cify College, already noted under Secondary Instruction, besides pre- 
paratory high school studies of 3 years, has 2 years that are collegiate in character, 
which prepare for Johns Hopkins University. 
For 1883-84, 9 other colleges report, 5 of which receive annually State aid, viz, 
St. John’s, Western Maryland, Baltimore Female, Washington, and Frederick Col- 
Jeges. They report to the State authorities 269 male and 103 female students, 29 
teachers (one college not reporting this item), and $22,190 received from the State. In 
return 95 free scholarships were given. These are for students selected by soe 
boards after competitive examination, the holders being pledged to complete the fu 
course of 4 years and to teach in the public schools of the State at least 2 years after 
raduation. 
. The remaining colleges are Loyola, Rock Hill, St. Charles, New Windsor, and 
Mt. St. Mary’s, of comparatively low standard. All 10, except possibly Rock Hill 
and Frederick Colleges, have preparatory courses of from 1 to 4 years; in these 
colleges the length of the preparatory course is not defined ; all but Frederick show 
classical courses of 3 or 4 years; 3 have scientific courses, so called, of 3 or 4 years; 
St. John’s shows a graduate course of 2 years, the undergraduate course being par- 
tially elective, with modern languages; Loyola and Rock Hill, commercial courses, 
of 4 and 2 years, respectively ; Washington also offers a special or partial course to 
students not candidates for a degree; St. Mary’s, an ecclesiastical and a commercial 
course ; New Windsor, normal and commercial courses, with instruction in music, 
painting, and modern languages. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The 6 institutions of this character reporting in 1883~84 are Baltimore Academy of 
the Visitation, Baltimore Female College and Burkittsville, Cambridge, Frederick, 
and Lutherville Female Seminaries, The Misses Norris’s School, though not reporting,
-P-A-G-E-395

remains on the list, as it is known to be still in existence. These institutions show 
the collegiate courses common to schools of this class, embracing also courses in mod- 
ern languages, music, and art, Frederick in addition offering a graduate course in 
belles-lettres. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix; forasummary of same, 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding, 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Special facilities for scientific study continue to be offered by the Maryland Agri- 
cultural and Mechanical College, the United States Naval Academy, and the Johns 
Hopkins University. 
St. John’s College announced in a circular of July, 1883, the organization of a tech- 
nical department, including civil and mechanical engineering, with analytical chem- 
istry. Students are admitted who have mastered the ordinary English branches. 
Courses in general science, as before noted, are presented by Baltimore City and Rock 
Hill Colleges. 
The Muryland Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1882~83 had 55 students. 
Though without State aid, the college received an income of $7,000 from United States 
Jand scrip fund and $4,500 from tuition fees. The course of instruction, extending 
over 4 years, embraces scientific and practical agriculture, civil engineering and 
physics, E.nglish literature, mental and moral science and history, mathematics, chem- 
istry, and ancient and modern languages. Instruction in the department of agricult- 
ure includes both theory and practice and is intended to embrace the widest field 
of knowledge and to impart the most thorough course of instruction possible. The 
practical department comprises work on the farm and in the laboratories. For farm 
work the students are divided daily into garden, field, yard, and ground detail, under 
competent supervision. Suitable compensation is paid to students on special volun- 
tary detail on Saturdays and during vacations. Provision is also made in the charter 
of the college for technical education, which it is the intention of the ins‘ itution to 
develop to the extent of itsability. Military instruction under a United States officer 
is required and is said to be of great value for health and discipline. The farm con- 
tains 286 acres; the building and apparatus are valued at $100,000, 
In the United States Naval Academy, the course of study covers 4 years in academy 
and 2 at sea, and includes, besides English studies, history, law, and modern. lan- 
guages, higher mathematics, seamanship, ship building, ordnance and armor, marine 
and steam engineering, navigation, naval architecture, tactics, gunnery, chemistry 
and electricity, astronomy, surveying, applied mechanics, and free hand and me- 
chanical drawing. 
An act of Congress of August 5, 1882, provides that there shall be no more appoint- 
ments of cadet midshipmen or cadet engineers at the Naval Academy, but that in lieu 
thereof “naval cadets” shall be appointed from each congressional district and from 
the country at large. From those who successfully complete the 6-year course 
appointments are hereafter to be made in the lower grades of the line and engineer 
corps of the Navy and of the Marine Corps, but only in sufficient number to fill va- 
cancies therein, provided, however, that the number of such graduates be not reduced 
below 10 in each year. 
Johns Hopkins University continued in 1883-84, as in preceding years, to furnish op- 
portunities for advanced scientific study in its graduate departments, while in the 
undergraduate department the more elementary scientific studies were pursued with 
the aid of the new laboratories before mentioned. Of the 249 students, 37 were en- 
gaged the various branches of mathematics, 56 in physics, 51 in chemistry, and 47 
in biology. 
The eolentifia work of the year has gone beyond the possibility of a full report 
here. The original laboratory for chemistry has been enlarged to three full stories 
and a basement. A new building for the biological laboratory has been erected, 
affording ample facilities for study and adding much to the facilities for imparting ‘ 
scientific knowledge. Classes have been taught in the various branches of mathe- 
matics, including among other things algebra in multiple quantity, non-Euclidian 
geometry, mathematical astronomy, spherical harmonics, differential equations, solid 
analytical geometry, the caleulus, and probabilities; in physics, including heat con- 
duction, physical optics, mechanics, mathematical theory of sound, and electricity, 
with weekly exercises in the laboratories; and in biology, including animal and vege- 
table physiology and morphology. : 
The Chesapeake Zodlogical Laboratory presents the results of a series of original 
experiments in this department of science, 
Work in archzology received much attention during the year, resulting in the or- 
ganization of an archeological society in the university for the prosecution of this 
study.

  124 “REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—The theological schools in the State reporting in 1882~83 and in 
1883~84 remain the same as heretofore. These are the Centenary Biblical Institute, 
Baltimore (Methodist); the Theological Seminary of St. Sulpice, Baltimore, and the 
ecclesiastical seminaries of Mt. St. Mary’s College, Emmettsburg, of Mt. St. Clement’s 
College, Ichester, and of Woodstock College, Woodstock, all 4 Roman Catholic; and 
Westminster Theological Seminary, Westminster (Methodist Protestant), These 4 
report courses of study, respectively, of 5, 4, 6, and 7 years, but the portion which is 
strictly professional does not appear. The Westminster Theological Seminary, opened 
in 1882, held its first commencement May 4, 1884. It reports a theological course of 
3 years, subject to such modifications as circumstances may require; it had 5 instrue- 
tors and 20 students during 1883~’84, and 1 graduate. 
The Centenary Institute, first mentioned, for the training of colored preachers, had, 
up to the close of 1883-84, a preparatory course of 3 grades, which was to be abolished 
from September, 1884; a good normal course; and a theological course of 3 years, of 
39 weeks each. Of the 151 students reported for 1883~384, 15 were theological. 
For statisties of the above schools, sec Table XI of the appendix ; for summaries of 
the same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.—The School of Law of the University of Maryland offered in 188384 a course 
of study extended from its previous one of 2 years of 32 wecks each to 3 years of 36 
weeks each. 
For statistics of schools of theology and law, see Tables XI and XII of the appendix. 
Medical.—Five ‘‘ regular” schools of medicine reported for the 2 years under 
review, all in the city of Baltimore, viz, the School of Medicine of the University of 
Maryland, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Baltimore Medical College, 
the Woman’s Medical College, and the medical department of the Johns Hopkins 
University. 
The first two recommend, but do not require, a 3-year graded course, and make no 
requirements for admission, while the Baltimore Medical College and the Woman’s 
Medical College require either a diploma from some institution of learning or evidence 
of a good English education. For graduation all, except the Johns Hopkins depart- 
ment, require attendance on two full courses of lectures. In the school of the University 
of Maryland these include 22 weeks each; in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
20 weeks each; in Baltimore Medical College, 30 weeks each; and in the Woman’s Col- 
lege, 28 weeks. 
Johns Hopkins University offers a preliminary course of training for those who 
intend to pursue the study of medicine, the principal elements of the course being 
physics, chemistry and biology, Latin, German, French, and English, with oppor- 
tunities for the study of psychology, logic, history, and other branches of knowledge, 
according to the requirements of the scholar. 
Deniisiry is taught in the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in a full course of 
2 years of 20 weeks each. Chartered in 1839 and opened in 1840, it claims to be the 
oldest and for many years the only dental college in the world. Up to its commence- 
inent in 1884, 2,087 had attended its annual sessions and 1,210 had been graduated. 
The dental department of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, gives instruction 
in a 2-year course of 23 weeks each under 16 resident and 10 non-resident instructors, 
with 86 students, 46 of whom had received a degree in letters or science. 
Pharmacy was taught in the Maryland College of Pharmacy by a faculty of 5 in- 
structors in a 2-year graded course of 20 weeks each. During the year 1883-84 it had 
added a laboratory department with capacity for 75 students at atime. The degree 
of graduate of pharmacy is conferred upon graduates of the full course. Require- 
ments for graduation are 21 years of age, an apprenticeship of 4 years to the apothe- 
cary business, attendance upon 2 full courses of lectures and 1 course in analytical 
chemistry, and a thesis of not less than 15 pages. 
For statistics of schools of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, see Table XIII of the 
appendix; and for a summary of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb, Frederick City, undertakes the educa- 
tion and industrial training of all white deaf-mutes of the State of school age (9 to 
21) and free from disqualifying physical or mental infirmities. The studies pursued 
are the common English branches, with drawing and the industries of cabinet and shoe 
making and printing for the boys; for the girls, sewing and general housework. Ar- 
ticulation is taught to such as may be able to profit by it. For 188182 and 1882~83 
there were 66 boys and 55 girls in the institution. Of this number 120 were from the 
State and 1 from Pennsylvania. 
The Maryland Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Baltimore, is for white
-P-A-G-E-397

youth between the ages of 9 and 18. It gives instruction in a common English 
course and music, with broom and mattress making, piano tuning, sewing, and knit- 
ting. The whole number attending for 1883~84 was 81, of whom 10 completed the 
whole or partial course and 9 left for various causes, leaving 62 at the end of the 
ear. 
. The Institution for the Colored Blind and Deaf-Mutes, Baltimore, is exclusively for the 
education of such children as come under its care and is not in any sense an asylum. 
The studies pursued are such as are taught in the public schools for colored youth, 
with the addition of various trades like broom making, chair caning, sewing, and 
others adapted to their capacity and wants. There were 34 pupils in the institution 
in 1882-83, of which number 20 were blind and 14 deaf-mutes, being an increase of 6 
over the previous year. Five were from Washington, D. C., and 2 from West Virginia. 
M’DONOGH INSTITUTE. 
This school has for its object the education and the moral and physical training of 
poor boys of the city of Baltimore. Common and higher English studies are pur- 
sued, with drawing and German. Attention is given to moral and religious instruc- 
tion; also, to military drill and discipline. The age for admission is 10 to16. To 
encourage a desire to excel and to give further advantage to the worthy, the board 
has established scholarships to be conferred on boys who, up to the age of 16, have 
best improved their school opportunities, which scholarships entitle the holders to 
the privileges of the school for an additional year. 
Vacation is spent by the boys in gardening and farming. During the session of 
school, which covers 10 months in the year, they do but little of such work, as that 
would interfere with school duties. Work in the garden, however, is often substi- 
tuted for play as a penalty for small offences. 
There were 49 boys in the institution, under 6 instructors, including the principal 
and matron, at the close of the year 1882~83. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, with 2 houses of refuge, one for white boys 
and the other for white girls, Baltimore, and the House of Reformation and Instruc- 
tion, for colored children, Cheltenham, all attend to the moral, educational, and in-

OBITUARY RECORD. 
MRS. ALMIRA LINCOLN PHELPS, 
Almira Hart, daughter of Samuel and Lydia Hart (the former a direct descendant of the early puritan colonist Hart, after whom the city of Hartford was named), was born July 15, 1793, at Berlin, Conn. She was a younger sister of Mrs. Emma Willard, widely known as a writer and teacher and founder of Troy Female Seminary. Almira 
received a good education, in which she was greatly assisted by her sister, and at the age of sixteen years began to teach, her first charge being a district school in the neigh- 
borhood of her home. After a few years she removed to Sandy Hill, where she intro- duced improved methods of instruction, the most yaluable being one in geography, originated by her sister. In 1817 she married Simon Lincoln, publisher and editor of 
The Connecticut Mirror, who died six years after, leaving his widow with two daugh- 
ters. Mrs. Lincoln then recommenced teaching with her sister in the Troy Female 
Seminary, remaining there eight years. Her studies comprised the ancient and mod- 
ern languages and the natural sciences, especially botany, on which she published 
two works which had a large circulation. She contributed to Woodbridge and Will- 
ard’s Geography, translated Vauquelin’s Dietionary of Chemistry (which translation 
was published in 1829), and published The Female Student in 1833. In 1833 she com- 
menced teaching at West Chester, Penn. The next important step of her life was her 
marriage with John Phelps, a lawyer of Vermont. In 1841 Mrs. Phelps removed to 
Ellicott City, Md., where she was principal of the Patapsco Female Institute, then 
under the control of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Although a devoted member 
of this church, Mrs. Phelps used her powerful influence to make the institution non- 
sectarian, and succeeded. Her second husband died in 1849, leaving a son and a

daughter. Mrs. Phelps’seldest daughter also died during that year, and the bereaved 
mother soon after retired from the profession she had successfully followed for more 
than forty years. She continued, however, to write on educational and other themes, 
publishing various books, among them Hours With My Pupils, besides many con- 
Eeibtsbie’ to magazines and reviews, her publications on the subjects of geology, 
chemistry, and natural philosophy being too numerous to mention. Her health re- 
mained good up to a short period before her death, which occurred at Baltimore, July 
15, 1884, on her ninety-first birthday.

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
The record for the school years 1882~83 and 1883-’84 shows large advance at.almost 
all points, the statistics of school youth, enrolment, average membership and average 
attendance, schools, teachers, and teachers’ pay for 1882-’83 all indicating progress, 
and evening schools alone showing a very slight decline in enrolment. In 1883~84 
this slight fall was much more than compensated by an increase of 2,139, enrolment 
and attendance in all the schools increased considerably, and the figures, with slight 
exceptions, are on the gaining side. 
While the State is thus advancing as compared with itself, as is shown by two im- 
portant tables in the report for 1862~83, it leads all other States in some of the most 
important evidences of a good school system. First, as respects native white illit- 
eracy : the proportion of native whites 10 years of age and upwards unable to write, 
according to the last United States census return, published in 1883, was only seven- 
tenths of 1 per cent. in Massachusetts, while in Connecticut it was 1 per cent.; in 
New Hampshire and Nevada, 1.1; in New York, 2.2; and so on in a steadily advanc- 
ing ratio to North Carolina, in which it was 31.7; while in the Territory of New Mexico 
it reached the alarming figure of 64.2. Next, as respects colored persons 10 years of 
age and upwards unable to write: by the same census Massachusetts leads all the 
States, the per cent. of such illiteracy being only 15.1, while in other Northern States 
it ranges from 15.8 to 53.9, and in the Southern States from 55 in West Virginia to 
81.6 in Georgia. Finally, Massachusetts occupies a leading position in respect to the 
attendance of youth of school age in the public schools, but, as this age varies widely 
in different cases, the figures do not readily admit of fair comparison. In the fulness 
of its school courses, the large number of its towns and cities with high grade schools, 
and inthe completeness of the education given throughout the grades, a success is 
attained which comparatively few other States emulate, and which, it is believed, no 
other has yet reached. 
  ADMINISTRATION. 
A State board of education of 8 members, with annual change of one, is presided 
over by the governor (who appoints the members), and by the lieutenant governor in 
his absence. This board has general charge of State school interests, with special 
inspection of the State normal schools. It prescribes the form of registers to be kept 
in public schools and the forms of the returns to be made by school committees. All 
educational institutions aided by the State must report to it. 
In its supervision of State schools it is aided by a secretary and assistant secretary, 
chosen. by it, and by 3 agents, who visit the different sections of the State, inspect 
schools, hold institutes, and stimulate school officers and teachers to higher standards 
and better school work. 
Cities and towns (answering to townships elsewhere) have each an elective school 
committee of 3 members or some multiple of 3, with a possible annual change of one- 
third. These committees must maintain for at least 6 months each year, under com- 
petent and reputable teachers, enough schools for instructing in the common English 
branches all the children that may legally attend them. They may add also algebra, 
vocal music, sewing, physiology, hygiene, agriculture, and, since 1884, elementary 
instruction in the use of hand tools. ‘Towns with 500 families must maintain a hi eb. 
school,! with the usual studies of Such schools, including Latin. Towns with 4,00 
inhabitants must provide teachers competent to instruct in Greek, French, astronomy, 
geology, rhetoric, logic, intellectual and moral science, and political economy. 
The minor school districts, always a hindrance to great educational success, having 
been abolished in 1883, towns now form the units of the State school system. 
Providing thus for the education of its children, the State requires that all of schcol 
age (5-15) must have the benefit of the instruction it provides or of such other as 
parents and guardians may prefer. It accordingly forbids the employment of chi)}- 
dren under 10 years of age in any manufacturing, mechanical, or mercantile establish- 
ment. It allows no child under 14 years of age to be so employed, except during tho 
vacations of the public schools, unless in the year preceding he has had at least 20 
weeks’ attendance on some school approved by the school committee, or on like evi- 
dence of regular attendance, during such employment, on a half time day school, 
similarly approved. School committees are required to aid in carrying out these 
arrangements. Owners, superintendents, or overseers of the establishments above 
mentioned who employ children in violation of the law, and parents or guardians con- 
senting to such employment and thus hindering the education of their children, are 
liable to a fine of $20 to $50. . 
FINANCES. 
The chief means for the support of public schools come from taxes voted by the 
people in the towns (and cities) at their annual meetings or at a meeting called for   
1A adjacent towns, with less than 500 inhabitants, may form a union high school.
-P-A-G-E-401
  MASSACHUSETTS. 129 
the purpose. The levy of such taxes is made peremptory by the requirement that a 
town refusing or neglecting to raise the money held necessary for its schools shall 
forfeit a sum equal to twice the highest ever before voted for the support of schools 
therein. The sums thus raised by town tax are supplemented by annual apportion- 
ments from a moderate State school fund to towns that have complied with all the 
- laws relating to this apportionment. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Alaw approved May 14, 1883, requires every town and city with 10,000 or more 
inhabitants to maintain, in addition to the other schools already legalized, evening 
schools for instruction in the common English branches, with drawing, history of the 
United States, and good behavior. The school committees of such towns may add 
other branches and must have the same supervision of these evening schools as of 
other schools. ‘This law modifies section 7 of chapter 44 in the existing school laws 
of 1883. 
In 1884 a law was passed directing school committees to purchase text books and 
other school supplies and to loan them to pupils of their public schools not already 
supplied, free of charge, unless the books should be abused. It is believed that, 
after the first year, this measure will reduce the cost of the schools. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES AND TOWNS WITH OVER 7,500 INHABITANTS, 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For both cities and towns the continued general rule is that school committees of 3 
members, or some multiple of 3, are chosen for terms of 3 years, to have charge of the 
public schools. These committees may be changed in one-third of their membership 
each year. In cities they generally have superintendents for their schools, the mayor 
being ex officio chairman of the board. Boston, besides a superintendent, has 6 
supervisors for special parts of the school work.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Aitleborough, with 52 fewer school youth than in 1881~’82, showed in 1882~’83 an in- 
crease of 142 in enrolment, of 219 in average daily attendance, and of $7,165 in ex- 
penditure for schools. 
In 1883~84 there was a large loss in school youth, a slight one in average attend- 
ance, and one of $10,138 in expenditure, but a gain of 76 in enrolment and of 9 in 
teachers. 
Beverly a little more than held its own from 1881~682 to 1882~83, and in 1883~84 
shows a gain of 27 in school youth, of 31 in enrolment, and of 20 in average daily at- 
tendance. 
Boston public schools, with a fair increase at all points in 1882-83, made in 1883~84 
an advance of 1,086 in school population, of 3,000 in enrolment, of 665 in average 
daily attendance, of 16 in teachers, and of $227,339 in expenditure. The schools 
taught during the year were | normal, 10 Latin and high, 51 grammar, 450 primary, 
and 22 special schools; in all, 534. Of the 1,250 teachers in these schools, 1,066 were 
females. Forthe schools there were 159 school-houses, with 60,558sittings, school prop- 
erty being valued at $7,792,650, The schools were in session the full 206 days of the 
school year. The per cent. of enrolment on schoo) population is 99.32, the school age 
bein, 15. 
The estimated enrolment in private and church schools was 7,319, which, added to 
the number in the city schools, makes 6,807 more in school than the whole number of 
school age, or 111.39 per cont. The per cent. of average attendance to enrolment is 
74.72. Tho large increase in expenditure over 1883 was in part an additional appropri- 
ation of $2,500 for a manual training school organized this year, and $60,000 for the pur- 
chase of free text books, required byarecent law. Ofthe535 pupilsin the Latin schools, 
30 boys and 13 girls completed the entire course and 23 boys and 3 girls entered Harvar 
College er the Annex with honors. The experiment of a manual training school, first 
introduced in 1883, has been successful, 200 boys coming from the grammar schools te

constitute the class, Each student had two hours of instruction weekly in alterna- 
tion with the regular school work. Attendance is not compulsory. This shop work 
is regarded by the apprentices as a recreation, and the interest exhibited is marked, 
the boys remaining longer than is required. The practical results appear in the skill 
displayed in applying to carpentry and cabinet work the rules of drawing and di- 
mension which they have learned at school. Evening schools continue to hold an 
important place in the school system. While the elementary classes show a falling 
off of 87, the evening high school increased 306, there being 1,642 registered in March, 
1884. The interest in this school is said to have been great, and yet irregularity of 
attendance, caused largely by the want of competent teachers, reduced the average 
attendance to 832. During 1882~’83 there were 9,614 days of substitute teachers’ 
service rendered in the schools. 
By order of the school committee, May, 1883, the board of supervisors revised the 
courses of study for the primary and grammar schools, aiming to simplify and re- 
arrange the matter embraced in the course, to reduce the amount of work in each 
year and in each branch of study, to reduce the number of topics, and to make a 
better distribution of time. A committee reported 3,667 truants and urged the re- 
moval of the truant school from Deer Island to some suitable location under the care 
of the school committee, with an industrial department. 
The school committee say that the public education of Boston is fast outstripping 
all private schools in variety and scope; that military exercises for boys and sewing 
for girls are no longer novelties; that boys are taught skilled manual labor and in- 
dustrial drawing, not only in regular classes, but in 13 special schools, from which 
last drawings have been sent to the New Orleans Exposition, the equals of which 
could hardly have been produced by the best drawing schools of thirty years ago. ~ 
Brockton in 1883-84 shows an advance over 1882~83 of 211 in school population, of 
424 in enrolment, of 240 in average attendance, of 7 in teachers, and of $14,363 in ex- 
penditure; of the pupils enrolled, 72.77 per cent. were in average daily attendance, 
Brookline shows gains over 1882~’83 of 153 in school population, of 38 in enrol- 
ment, of 43 in average attendance, and of $23,876 in school expenditure, this last due 
to the addition of two rooms to one school building and the erection of a school, at an 
expense of $24,500, Teel Og the value of school property to $121,800. The usual even- 
ing school was sustained by an appropriation of $500, with an average attendance of 
30. A new enterprise was the opening of an industrial vacation school, continuing 
8 weeks and offering instruction in elementary carpentry and joinery, with applica- 
tions. Beginning July 9, 1883, it had 21 regular pupils who made satisfactory prog- 
ress, 12 others that entered being dropped because of irregular attendance. 
Cambridge, with advance at almost all points in 1882~’83, shows in 1883~84 an in- 
crease of 120 in enumeration, of 296 in registered attendance, of 292 in average attend- 
ance, and of $18,662 in expenditure. This is all the information at hand, no city report 
having been received. s 
Chelsea in 1883~84 gained 622 in school youth‘and 79 in average attendance, but. 
lost 132 in enrolment, An increase of $10,332 in expenditure is partly accounted for 
by the furnishing of additional accommodations for an increasing school population, 
a new building opened February, 1884, not supplying even the then present want. . 
Though there were 14 school buildings, valued at $435,000, 3 additional new ones were 
required. The city maintains77 schools: 1 high, 38 grammar, 36 primary, and 2 even- 
ing schools, one of the last devoted entirely to drawing. These evening schools en- 
rolled 375, of whom 75 were in the drawing school, making a total enrolment of 5,111 
in all public schools, 
Chicopee in 1883~84 had 10 school buildings, with 1,590 sittings, all school property 
being rated at $98,885. With 115 fewer school youth, there was an increase of 55 in 
enrolment, of 77 in average attendance, and of $3,984 for schools. These were 2 high, 
2 grammar, 3 intermediate, 7 primary, 2 ungraded, and 2 evening drawing schools, one 
of these last with 41, the other with 39 sessions, and the aggregate EOE in both 
was497, There are also 2 free evening drawing schools in which instruction is given 
in geometrical and scale drawing, mechanical or architectural designs, tinting, shad- 
ing, &c. In 2 parochial schools there ‘were 1,065 pupils. 
Clinton in 1882~83, under a new superintendent, reorganized its schools, introducing 
music into the primary classes under a special teacher. In 1883~84 a report shows 12 
school buildings for the enrolment of 1,657, with but slight changes since 188283, 
Schools are classed as high, grammar, and primary. 
Fall River, losing at some points in 148283 but gaining anew in 1883~’84, reports for 
that year 38 school buildings, with 9,363 sittings for its 11,128 school youth.! Of this 
number, May 1, 1883, 1,131 were found in private and parochial schools, 1,643 at work 
in mills, and 1,425 neither at work nor at school, leaving 6,929 in school; yet 93.84   
1Fall River has long needed a new high school building, and on the 5th of February, 1883, it grato- 
fally accepted from Mrs, Mary B. Young an offer to erect’ and furnish, at her own expense, an edifice for that purpose, with spacious grounds, in a beautiful location, and with ample apparatus, the whole 
to be a memorial of a deceased son.

    132 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
per cent. of school youth were enrolled in the city schools and 64.4 per cent. of the 
enrolled were in average attendance. The day schools are high, grammar, inter- 
mediate, primary, and suburban. : 
A uniform advance appears in these schools from 1882~’83 of 1,163 in school youth, 
of 201 in enrolment, of 252 in average attendance, and of $21,917 in outlay, the city 
expending $29,488 for a new school-house and repairs which added 350 school sittings. 
Truancy was held in check by the vigilance of truant officers better than in any pre- 
vious year. Of the 219 truants, all but 9 were restored. Fall River was the first to 
adopt the plan of free text books under the permissive law of 1873, made imperative 
on school boards from August, 1884. The average daily attendance since the adoption 
of this plan by the city has gained 49 per cent. 
The evening drawing school continued its session of 17 weeks in 1883~84, the class 
in free hand drawing meeting on 2 evenings a week, with 131 enrolled and 66 in aver- 
age attendance; while the mechanical and architectural classes met on 2 other even- 
ings, with 42 enrolled and 33 in average attendance. Some of the work was superior 
to that of last year, while none fell behind. There were 600 drawings to be put on 
exhibition in the rooms of the school committee. 3 
The city training school in June, 1883, graduated a class of 14 young women, and 
at the next session 31 entered, 3 by examination and 28 by virtue of their graduation. 
Fitchburg in 1883~’84 had 18 school buildings, with 3,128 sittings, valued at $184,033. 
There. are 287 more sittings than the reported enrolment. The schools (high, gram- 
mar, intermediate, secondary, primary, and ungraded) show an increase of 112 in 
school youth, of 56 in enrolment, and of 117 in average daily attendance. There were 
2 special teachers of music, drawing, and penmanship. Under a law of 1883, requir- 
ing towns and cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants to maintain evening schools, 2 
were opened for common school studies, the first of this class since 1880. An even- 
ing faring school had a session of 71 evenings, 80 pupils entering the mechanical 
and 60 the free hand classes. The work dono is said to have been very satisfactory. 
Gloucester in 1883-84 had 22 school-houses, as in 1881-82, but in better condition 
and affording 4,152 school sittings, 111 more than its school youth, 9 more than the 
city enrolment, and 871 more than the average daily attendance. With a diminution 
of 76 in children of school age, there was yet a gain of 200 in enrolment and of 254 in 
average daily attendance. ‘Ihe schools are high, grammar, primary, and mixed. The 
city council had purchased a lot for a long needed new high school building. The 
introduction of free text books and stationery took effect at the beginning of the fall 
term, with an outlay of $5,600. Music and drawing, under special teachers, are said 
to have been pursued with improved methods and unusual success. A sewing school 
held on Saturdays from January to June registered 269 pupils, with an average at- 
tendance of 156, under 31 regular and 16 occasional teachers. 
Haverhill in 1883~84 expended for schools $22,060 more than in 1882~83, probably 
for the erection of 3 new brick school buildings, completed and occupied May 1, 1884, 
which relieved the previous crowded condition of the primary schools. Teachers re- 
mained the same in number, but, with 9 more school youth, there was a decrease of 
239 in enrolment and of 192 in average daily attendance. Two evening schools, } for 
males and 1 for females, were reported in 1882-83, but with a rather unsatisfactory 
attendance. An evening drawing school in the same year is said to have been well 
attended. A city training school, with 170 to 216 pupils, 2 regular and 16 pupil 
teachers, was regarded as an important factor in the preparation of teachers for the 
public schools. 
Holyoke in 188384 had 13 school buildings, with 66 occupied and 4 unoecupied 
rooms, against 12, with 65 occupied and 5 unoccupied rooms, in 1882-’83, an increase 
of 217 in school youth, of 303 in enrolment, of 289 in pyertee attendance, and of $6,594 
in expenditure for schools. The existence of rooms crowded so as to be detrimental 
to the health of children was a matter of serious complaint, but one that will proba- 
bly be soon remedied. Tho law requiring free text books and stationery, which went 
into effect at the opening of the year, increased expenses considerably for the time, 
but will be an eventual economy. A revision of the rules of the board was made, re- 
quiring examination in writing for admission to the high school. Evening schools 
were open in both years, from October 15 to the Christmas holidays, for French, Ger- 
man, and English speaking pupils, with an aggregate enrolment of 808 and an aver- 
age attendance of 360 in the latter year. An evening drawing school awaited the 
completion of a new high school building, when it was to open with much improved 
facilities. Music appears to have been especially well taught. The report of truant 
officers shows that over 70 per cent. of the children not at work nor in school were 
under 8 years of age. There were 1,691 enrolled in private and parochial schools, an 
increase of 168 within the year. 
Lawrence, compared with 1882~83, shows a gain of 198 in schvol youth and of 29 in 
enrolment, but a loss of 90 in average attendance, while $13,168 more were expended 
for schools. No other information is at hand. 
Lowell in 1882~’83 had 92 public schools, consisting of 1 high, 9 grammar, 2 mixed,
-P-A-G-E-405

and 80 primary. Three special teachers in penmanship, music, and military tactics 
were employed. Five free evening schools, including a high school, enrolled 1,476, 
with an average attendance of 534. In the evening drawing school work was dono 
in machine, architectural, modelling, and free hand departments, by 297 students in 
the spring and 553 in the fall session. Appropriation, $4,000. 
In 1883~84 the 43 school buildings and property were rated at $663,760. There 
was a gain of 404 in school youth and of 82 in enrolment over 1882-83, but a loss of 
100 in average daily attendance. Expenditure for schools was $33,310 more. 
At Lynn in 1882-83 extensive repairs were made on school-houses, improving the 
sanitary condition of some rooms. Discipline is said to have reached a high standard. 
Attendance was improved through the exertions of a truant officer, but in spite of 
all that ean be done truancy is sadly prevalent. The continued vigilance of parents, 
teachers, and truant officers cannot wholly control it. An evening drawing school 
was largely attended and kept up its former standard of excellence in mechanical, 
free hand, and stump drawing from models and casts. There were also 21 common 
evening schools, with an average attendance of 345, under 31 teachers. 
In 1883~84 a well proportioned advance on the previous year was made, there 
being 244 more school youth, 398 more enrolled, 261 more in average daily attendance, 
17 more teachers, and $24,545 more expended for schools. 
Malden in 188384 shows 10 city school buildings and 2,444 sittings, or 217 more than 
the reported enrolment and 793 more than the reported average attendance. There 
are gains at all points over 188283: of 185 in youth of school age, of 73 in enrol- 
ment, of 80 in average attendance, and of $5,660 in expenditure for schools. School 
property was rated at $195,429. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial 
schools, 600. 
Martborough fell off, from 1882~63, 114 in school youth, 147 in enrolment, 65 in 
average attendance, and $11,047 in expenditure. The rating of 15 school buildings, 
with other school property, was $65,300, There were 200 attending private and pa- 
. rochial schools. 
Medford in 1883~’84 pained 47 in school population, 53 in enrolment, 32 in average 
daily attendance, 2 in teachers, and expended for schools $5,748 more than in 1882-83. 
Milford had 11 fewer school youth, 390 fewer enrolled, and 38 fewer in average 
attendance than in 1882~83, though $942 more were expended for schools. Of the 41 
teachers, 13 had attended normal schools. The 19 school buildings had 2,414 sittings; 
valuation, $78,500. Two special teachers in evening schools were employed. Enrol- 
ment in private and parochial schools, 290. 
Natick reports only statistics, which show, as compared with 1882~’83, a loss of 72 
school youth and of 10 in average daily attendance, a gain of 94 in enrolment, and 
a decrease of $5,078 in expenditure for schools, Of the 23 teachers who had attended 
normal schools, 19 had graduated. 
New Bedford in 1883~84 gained 205 in youth of school age, but lost 290 in enrol- 
ment and &4 in average attendance, expending for the year $14,570 less. ‘The 24 school 
buildings, with other property, were rated at $399,600. Of the 120 teachers, 3 were 
special, in music, drawing, and sewing, and 29 had attended and were graduates of 
normal schools, 
Newburyport, giving few statistics for 188384, shows a gain of 70 in school youth, 
but a decline of 256 in enrolment, of 20 in average daily attendance, and of $3,219 in 
expenditure for schools. Of its 42 teachers, 8 had attended normal schools. 
Newton, in the same year, shows an advance of 106 in school youth, of 243 in enrol- 
ment, of 107 in daily attendance, and of $53,322 in expenditure for schools. Of its 
104 teachers, 44 had attended normal schools, 32 being graduates. 
North Adams barely held its own in 1883-84, gaining only 42 in school youth and 56 
in average daily attendance, while it lost 8 in enrolment and expended for schools 
$20,865 less than in the previous year. Of its 54 teachers, only 2 had attended normal 
schools. Its 12 school buildings, with other school property, were rated at $142,000. 
No evening schools are reported. In private and parochial schools were'70 pupils. 
Northampton reports gains at all points, except average attendance, where there 
was a falling off of 79. School youth increased 247; enrolment, 133; and expenditure, 
$5,420 over 1882~83. Of the 78 teachers, 10 had attended normal schools and had 
graduated. One evening school and one special teacher in music are reported, with 
25 school-houses; valuation of school property, $127,885. 
Peabody presents a well proportioned advance on 1882~’83, increasing by 161 its 
school population, by 289 its enrolment, by 74 its average attendance, and expending _ 
$81 more for schools. Of 48 teachers reported, 17 had attended normal schools, 14 of 
them graduating. One special teacher in music is reported. School property in 7 
buildings was rated at $116,000. 
Pittsfield shows a growth of 263 in school youth, of 40 in enrolment, of 124 in aver- 
age attendance, and of $1,141 in school expenditure. Of its 27 school buildings, 21 
were for primary schools, 5 for grammar, and 1 for the high school. School property,

$86,300. One special teacher in music was employed. Only 9 of its 82 teachers had 
attended normal schools, 4 being graduates. 
Quincy, with school youth increased by 132 over 1882-83, gained but 68 in enrol- 
ment and 12 in average attendance, expenditure for schools being only $825 more. 
OF 50 teachers, 15 had attended normal schools, 13 graduating. 
Salem in 1883-’84 a little more than held its own, gaining but 43 in youth of school 
age and 98 in enrolment, while it lost 54 in average attendance and 2 teachers. 
It expended $50,576 more than in the previous year, partly for furniture, apparatus, 
and a supply of school books under the new law to that effect. Of 92 teachers, 63 had 
attended normal schools, 57 being graduates. 
Somerville presents for 1883~84 an advance of 376 in school youth, of 150 in enrol- 
ment, and of 186 in average daily attendance, though it expended $9,968 less. Three 
special teachers in evening schools and 1 in music were reported. Of the 106 teachers, 
20 were graduates of normal schools. School property, including 19 school buildings, 
was valued at $362,032. 
Springfield for 1883~'84 reported 25 school buildings (1 for the high school, 7 for the 
grammar, 17 for primary schools), school property having a value of $552,600. There 
Was an increase over 1882-83 of 114 in school youth, of 16 in enrolment, of 27 in 
average attendance, and of $17,563 in expenditure, largely for school buildings and 
repairs. Of the 130 teachers (7 more than necessary to supply the schools) 35 had 
attended normal schools and 26 had graduated. Special teachers in evening schools 
tmusic, drawing, and penmanship were employed. Enrolled in private and parochial 
schools, 500. 
Taunion in 1882~83 had 31 public school buildings, with 4,501 sittings, affording 
ample accommodation for its 4,353 youth enrolled and the 2,853 in average attend- 
ance. Entire school property was rated at $220,000. Two special teachers for evening 
schools and 1 for music were employed. Enrolled in private and parochial schools, 152. 
The report for 1883~’84 shows that, while school youth fell behind 177 and average 
daily attendance 91 from 188283, there was an increase of 559 in enrolment and of 
$11,807 in expenditure for schools. 
Waltham progressed from 1882-83, showing an increase of 229 in youth of school 
age, of 77in enrolment, of 79 in average attendance, and of $34,318 in expenditure for 
schools. School property, including 13 buildings, was rated at $261,000. Of the 62 
teachers, 18 had attended normal schools and 12 had graduated. 
Westfield, with 162 more school youth than in 1882~83, fell off 124 in enrolment, 105 
in daily attendance, and $3,006 in expenditure forschools. Of 57 teachers employed, 
31 had attended normal schools and 21 had graduated. 
‘eymouth in 1883-84, losing 33 in school youth, gained 21 in enrolment and 67 in

Worcester reported in 1882~83 41 school buildings, 1 for high, 28 for grammar, and 
12 for primary schools. These, with 11,658 sittings, seem to provide amply for the 
enrolment and- average daily attendance, exceeding the latter by 3,423. Special 
teachers in evening schools, music, and drawing were reported. Estimated enrolment 
in private and parochial schools, 1,500. 
he advance in 1883-’84 was 435 in school youth, 267 in enrolment, 847 in daily 
attendance, and $47,062 in school expenditure, Of 239 teachers, 162 were graduates 
of normal schools, 
KINDERGARTEN, 
Thero were in the State, as reported in 1883~84, 41 Kindergiirten of all grades. Of 
these, 21 were in Boston, 2 in Brookline, 5 in Cambridge, 2 in Cambridgeport, 1 in 
Chelsea, 1 in Florence, 2 in Jamaica Plain, 1 at Northampton, 4 in Roxbury, and | each 
in South Boston and West Newton. 
The existence of these schools is largely due to a spirit of womanly charity. The 
Albany Street Kindergarten and Nursery, Boston, was founded and supported by Mrs. 
Quincy Shaw, daughter of the late Louis Agassiz. The building being ready, Mrs. 
Shaw, with her assistants, gathered the poor children in and cared for, amused, and in- 
tructed them while their mothers went out to work. The nursery contained the babes 
of workingwomen. It is said that Mrs. Shaw has founded and supported 30 similar in- 
stitutions, placing them where the poor are the most numerous, as they are entirely for 
the children of workingwomen. 
The Florence Kindergarten owes its origin and maintenance to the generosity of Sam- 
uel L. Hill, a Friend, He first opened his parlors by way of experiment, embracing in
-P-A-G-E-407

his care not only the children of the well to do, but also those whose lives bad been 
overshadowed by the ignorance and poverty of parents. Pleased with the result, he 
erected a substantial building for the school and opened it in December, 1876. From 
December to April a large covered vehicle, prepared for the purpose, carries the children 
to and from school, thus securing regular attendance. During 1884 there were more 
than 80 children in attendance. 
For further information and statistics of these schools, seo Table V of the appendix; 
for a summary of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
Every teacher of a town or district school is required, before opening such school, 
to obtain from the school committee a certificate of qualification in duplicate, one to 
be deposited with the selectmen of the town. Until this is done, the teacher has no 
authority to teach or control a school nor any legal title to wages. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State in 188384 continued its aid to 6 schools for normal training, 5, at Bridge- 
water, Framingham, Salem, Westfield, and Worcester, to prepare teachers for the pub- 
lic schools, and 1, the Art Normal School, Boston, to prepare art teachers for cities 
and chief towns. The course of study of this last covers 4 years. Hachof the other 
5 schools has 2 courses, 1 of 2 years for those who propose to teach in lower schools, 
the other of 4 for such as aim at higher grades. The schools at Framingham and 
Salem are for females; the others, for both sexes. In the Salem school, during 1883~/R4,') 
4 classes of 12 scholars each and 1 of 6 were engaged in practice with hand tools. 
The State report expresses the belief that the time has come when this branch of in- 
struction should have a place in the curriculum of all the normal schools of the State. 
The attendance on these 5 schools during the year was 894; graduates, 184: Of 
teachers in public schools 2,744 have attended these normals, while 2,240 graduated 
from them. About 98 per cent. of the graduates teach after leaving the schools and 
four-fifths of the number teach in the schools of the State. 
Attendance in the Normal Art School for 1883~’84 was 123, of whom 3 graduated 
and 26 received certificates, An enlargement of the course went into effect during 
the year. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
When the State board of education is satisfied that 50 teachers of public schools de- 
sire to unite in forming a teachers’ institute, it may proceed to organize the institute. 
To defray the necessary expenses and to procure teachers and lecturers, a sum not 
exceeding $3,000 may annually be paid. Under this law, up to the close of 1883, in- 
stitutes had been held in 193 towns. During 1883~’84 there were held 35, represent- 
ing 152 towns, with an attendance of 2,770. 
Normal training was continued in the Boston Normal School, the Fall River and 
the Lawrence City ey Schools; in Wellesley College, and also to some extent 
at Harvard in vacation schools; in Cushing Academy, Ashburton, and the Kinder- 
garten of Miss Garland and Miss Weston, Boston. 
For further statistics of these and other schools of like character, see Tables III and 
V of the appendix ; for summaries of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
i EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The excellent Journal of Education, Boston, weekly, continued its regular issues 
from volume XVI, June 29 to December 28, 1882, to the close of volume XIX, June 
19, 1884, each volume containing over 400 pages. The first half of each issue is 
largely devoted to educational ideas and methods; the second, to educational news. 
Other publications from the same office were: Education, a bimonthly octavo, for 
the discussion of the science, art, and literature of education, in its fifth volume; The 
Public Schools, a monthly quarto, for presentation of principles and methods of teach- 
ing, in its third volume. The Primary Teacher has been replaced by The American 
Teacher, a monthly quarto, with a wider range of view and much useful matter in 
relation to Kindergiirten. Good Times no lounger appears. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Any town in the State may establish a high school for instruction in the higher 
English branches. Towns with 500 families or householders must have such schools 
ten months each year for ordinary high school studies, and towns of 4,000 inhabitants 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
136 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
\ 
must add instruction in Greek, French, astronomy, geology, rhetoric, logic, intellect- 
ual and moral science, and political economy. In 1884, with only 157 towns and 
cities of over 500 families, 210 maintained high schools’(53 of them voluntarily), 8 towns supported 2each, and Boston 11, making in the State 228 of the first class; while 
8 towns and cities with upwards of 4,000 inhabitants were required to farnish i 
struction in Greek, French, and other advanced studies, and 15 to 2U more did furnish 
such instruction voluntarily. The whole number of pupils in the 228 schools in 1883 
was 20,012, including many who had not studied high school branches, Of these 228 
schools, 183 are reported as regularly organized, with 14,955 pupils, of whom 6,422 
were boys and 8,533 girls. Nearly twice as many girls as boys receive the benefit of 
the full high school course. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
Thenumber of academies reported to the State authorities for 1883-84 is 75, an in- 
erease of 5; the number of pupils in them, 9,132, a decrease of 19. The estimated 
amount of tuition fees received was $472,994, an increase of $21,148. For statistics of , 
secondary schools, outside the State system, reported to this Bureau, see Tables IV, 
VI, and VII of the appendix; ior a summary of these statistics, see corresponding 
tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. j 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
There are still 7 institutions of this class reporting for 1882~@3 and 188384: Am- 
herst College, Amherst (Congregationalist); Boston College (Roman Catholic), and 
Boston University (Methodist Episcopal), both in Boston; Harvard University, Cam- 
bridge (non-sectarian); Tufts College, Collegé Hill (Universalist); Williams College, 
Williamstown (Congregationalist); and College of the Holy Cross, Worcester (Roman 
Catholic). All report classical collegiate courses of 4 years and most of them various 
other courses. 
Harvard University, during the two years under review, continued the advancement 
of its standard of admission and studies. The meetings of the faculty were chiefly 
occupied with the discussion of proposed changes, the problem being to devise a plan 
which should give modern studies an opportunity to show their worth as a prepara- 
tory training for liberal education without endangering the position of old studies 
whose value has been proved by long experience. As a beginning, it was decided 
that the freshman year should be largely elective, the studies to amount to 23 full 
courses, of which 134 were to represent the old prescribed work. This scheme of 
freshman studies was adopted only for 1883~84 as an experiment, subject to future 
consideration and such changes as experience might suggest. It was also proposed 
that the conditions of admission be so changed as to insure in preparatory schools 
greater attention to the study of English literature, including the history of England 
and of the United States; that English composition be made a part of the work of the 
freshman course, and that more practice in it be required throughout the course; that 
honors for success in these be given at graduation; and that more attention be devoted 
toelocution. Besides important changes made in existing ones, several new courses 
were established, making in all 156 courses offered in 188384. The appointment of 
an assistant professor in political economy in 1882~’83 enabled the faculty to double 
the amount of instruction.in a subject now pursued with great zeal by large numbers 
of students; new provision was also made for professional and scientific students to 
reach the master’s degree. In ancient and modern classics 43 evening readings were 
given by instructors in 1882~’83. The gifts to the university for immediate use 
amounted to $63,000 in 18 and to $81,346 in 188384, 
Boston University, in its college of liberal arts, besides arrangements for full colle-

persons unable to take the full course in arts but desiring to fit themselves for the 
professional schools of the university. Like provision is made for mature students 
who wish to pursue studies for the degree of a. B. with greater thoroughness or in 
another order than the regular 4-year course will allow. Special students of mature 
age and proper qualifications may also be admitted to instruction in the college of 
liberal arts. 
Amherst College in 1883-84 still adhered to its specialty of student government. Per- 
sons not wishing to pursue the 4-year course for the degree of a. B. may carry for- 
ward a select course under due direction. Resident graduates may pursue an extended 
course in any department. Degrees are conferred only on clear evidence of qualifica- 
tions. Gymnastic exercises are conducted under a professor of hygiene. Libraries 
in the college contained 43,000 volumes. 
Tufts College is said to have been in most hopefal condition in 1883-84. Recent gifts 
have provided for the erection of a natural history museum, a gymnasium, and for im- 
portant alterations in the main building. A 3-year course in electrical engineering

was added to the former one in cngineering. Special honors are still conferred on any 
senior of the regular or philosophical course who excels in natural history, physics, 
chemistry, mathematics, philosophy, modern languages, and classics. The degree ot 
A.M. is conferred, as.at Amherst, only on graduates of known qualification, but the 
required course for it, after graduation, is only half what it is there. 
Williams College in, 1883-84 offered 9 vlective studies to the senior class, each stu- 
dent to elect 2 and to pursue them trom September to June. Instruction in a part of 
these was given twice uw week; in the others, thrice 2 week. The apparatus for the 
study of astronomy now consists of an observatory, a transit instrument, a sideréal 
clock, a refracting telescope, and a meridian circle, with its special observatory. In 
the natural history department provision is made for a scientific expedition every 
fourth year. 
Boston College and the College of the IJoly Cross retained in 18 
mental, preparatory, and collegiate arrangements noticed in previous reports.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC.        
No essential changes appear in the course of study in the State Agricultural College, 
Amherst, or in the Lussey Institution of Harvard Universily, both fully noticed in the 
report for 1881. The legislature of 1883 appropriated $10,C00 to aid the former in 
providing for the theoretical and practical instruction required by the charter, and 
by the same act established 80 free scholarships, to be at the disposal of the State 
senators. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1883-84 not only retained its courses of 
three years in engineering, geology and mining, architecture, chemistry, metallurgy, 
natural history, physics, and electrical engincering, but had largely increased its fa- 
- cilities for study. A distinguishing feature of the institution is the prominence given 
to laboratory and shop work, with field practice, experiment, and research. For this 
work in 1882~83, the accommodations were very limited. Now ample and well lighted 
room is provided for laboratory work, mechavical engineering, and applied mechanics. 
A new building for mechanical art shops furnishes rooms covering 20,000 square 
feet of floor surface, in which have been placed 40 carpenters’ benches; 37 wood 
lathes ; 32 blacksmiths’ forges, with anvils and vises; 22 engine and 15 speed lathes 
for working metal, with a full equipment of planes, shapers, milling machines, and 
other apparatus from the best machine shops in the country. Students in all depart- 
ments in 1882~83, 516; in 188384, 557. 
The Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University continued in 188384 its 4 
courses in engineering, in chemistry, in natural history, and in mathematics, physics, 
and astronomy, each of 4 years. 1t confers the degrees of civil engineer and bach- 
elor of science. . 
The Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science is especially designed for 
those who wish to prepare for work as mechanics, civil engineers, chemists, and de- 
signers. Students selecting mechanical engineering go to a workshop, which, orig- 
inally designed for only 20 students, is now doubled in capacity and furnished with 
all the facilities for this work, from the first elements up to the building of machines. 
The course for this department covers 34 years; that of all others, 3 years of 42 weeks 
each. More than 80 per cent. of the graduates are engaged in occupations for which 
their training in the institute specially fitted them. 
The Boston University School of All Sciences, a department for elective graduate study, 
offers courses in mathematics and the natural sciences, including calculus, math- 
ematics, quaternions, biology, zodlogy, chemistry, physics, botany, and the physiology 
of the vertebrates, with what laboratory work the student may choose. 
Besides the above there were, as noted in 188182, opportunities for scientific eult- 
ure in the monthly meetings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the weekly 
meetings and laboratory instruction of the Boston Society of Natural History, in the 
Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology, and in the museum and sum-

Theology was taught in the 2 years under review in 7 schools with the usual courses 
of 3 years, mostly following a collegiate course, without evidence of which an ex- 
   amination was required for adm’ on. These schools were the Andover Theological 
Seminary (Congregational) ; Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge (non-sectarian); 
Episcopal Theoogical School, Cambridge (Protestant Episcopal); Boston University 
School of Theology (Methodist Episcopal); Tufts College Divinity School, College 
° Hill( Universalist); Newton Theological Institute, Newton (Baptist); and New Church 
Theological School, Waltham (Swedenborgian). In the Roman Catholic diocese of 
Springfield there were 50.ecclesiastical students in 1883 and.the same number in 1684, 
probably at the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester.

This association furnishes those who have not been able to pursue continuous stud- 
ies at school means to complete such studies at home by monthly correspondence 
through a staff of teachers. In the 11 years of its existence 1,179 women, engaged in 
family or other duties at their homes, have obtained positive and permanent gain in 
mental discipline. Of the 672 students in 1883~84, 123 were teachers by profession ; 
320 were new members ; 491 persevered. The highest rank was taken by 205; the sec- 
ond, by 249; the third, by 37. A staff of 201 volunteer teachers carried on the work, 
only 2 salaried assistants being employed. Of these 201 helpers, 54 taught history ; 
38, science; 19, art; 7, German; 15, French ; 69, English literature ; and 6 were heads of 
these departments. The work of the association embraces 38 States, 1 Territory, and 
Canada. During the year 20,000 documents were sent through the mail, 6,283 letters 
were written to students, and 5,740 were received from them. Of 1,525 volumes in 
the libraty of the society, 1,214 were circulated during the year. Funds come from 
tuition fees and donations, the latter in 1884 amounting to $2,931; expenditure,

In 1883~'84, there were, under 100 teachers, 1,949 students, representing 37 States, 6 
British provinces, and 3 foreign countries. There are separate schools for the piano, 
organ, voice, violin, orchestra, and band instruments; attention is given to the art of 
conducting concerts for church music, oratorio work, training of teachers for public 
schools, common and higher English branches, modern languages, elocntion, fine arts, 
and physical culture, The erection of an elegant hall after the best European models 
is contemplated, for which the famous Music Hall organ has been purchased. 
The Boston University College of Music presents a 3-year course fox students of aver- 
age proficiency in the best American conservatories of this art. It is therefore essen- 
tially a graduate course, and those that enter must | rove their acquaintance with the 
elementary principles of music and have a correct ear and‘‘a reasonable degree of 
skill. In 1804, it shows 19 professors and teachers and 35 students. 
The Wellesley College School of Music, Wellesley, Charles Morse, director, occupies 
an entire building of 38 music rooms, for teaching and practice, with a hall for choral 
singing, floors, partition walls, and doors being deadened. It offers 3 full courses in 
music, each extending through 5 years, viz, piano, organ, and voice training. In 
’84 there were in this school 148 students. 
‘rom the Boston Conservatory of Music, Julius Eichberg, director, there is no definite 
information. 
Elocution and visible speech were taught by M. L. Alonzo Butterfield, at 448 Shaw- 
mut avenue, Boston; elocution and voice culture, by Miss Marvette E, Eddy, at 175 
Tremont street, with special reference to teachers’ needs; instrnection in elocution, by 
Walter K. Fobes, 147 Tremont street. 
There are also the Boston School of Oratory, R. R. Raymond; the Blish School of 
Elocution, G. W. Blish ; the New England Conservatory of Music, Department of Elocu- 
tion, Samuel R. Kelley ; the Monroe Conservatory of Elocution, Dr.C. W. Emerson; and 
the School of Elocution and Expression, Miss Anna Baright. Mr. Moses True Brown, 
M A., professor of oratory at Tufts College, heid theve, in 1883, a Summer School of 
Oratory, and was to hold another at the same place, beginning July 9, 1084, and con- 
tinuing 5 weeks.     
TRAINING IN ARTS AND TRADES, 
There are special schools in Boston which give this instruction, of which the follow- 
ing are noticed : 
The New Art School, 161 Tremont street, under Frank M. Cowles, aims to develop 
the artistic individuality of pnpus by encouraging their special talents and tastes. In- 
struction is given by one teacher in figure paimting from the flat, cast, or life; by 
another, in still life, lowers, and composition ; by a third, in drawing still life, water 
colors, and perspective. There are also lectures and evening classes, separate classes 
for life models, and object studies for both ladies and gentlemen. 
The School of Art at Wellesley College, Wellesley, has a 5-year course embracing in the 
first year what relates to form; in the second, light and shade ; in the third and fourth, 
color; in the fifth, drawing and painting from life. Lectures are given during the’ 
course on ancient, classic, and modern art, science of perspective, composition) and 
style. In the regular college classes there is free instruction in art 2 hours a week 
during one college year, and further private lessons to such as desire. 
Mrs. Hemenway’s Vacation School of Industrial Training for Girls was opened during 
the school vacation of 1883, in the Star school-house on Tennyson street, as an experi- 
ment, the idea being to gather a class of poor girls who are kept in the city during 
the summer months and to add to their public school education industrial instruction. 
A trial during two summers was sufficient to show that a great lack in education had 
here been provided for. The girls, averaging 16 years of age, were taught needlework, 
clay modelling, light cabinet work, the details of housekeeping, and economical 
marketing. 
Mrs. Lincoln’s Boston Cooking School, at 158 Tremont street, was said, in 1883, to be 
the only one of its kind in America, as it provided instruction for those who wished to 
earn their living as cooks, Applications for graduates of this school were received 
. from States as distant as California, one coming from Constantinople. Large classes 
from the city and State hospitals took special courses to fit them for caring for the sick; 
there was also a class from the Harvard Medical College. 
From the Boston Cooking School of the Woman’s Educational Association, heretofore 
reporting, no information is at hand. Miss Parloa has transferred her work from 
Boston to New York and the West. 
There are 3 training schools for nurses in Boston: one attached to the Massachusetts 
General Hospital, one to the Boston City Hospital, and one to the New England Hos- 
pial for Women and Children. For statistics, see Table XVII. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The State provides for the education of its deaf and dumb in the American Asylum, 
Hartford, Conn., the Clarke Institution, Northampton, Mass., and the Horace Mann 
School, Boston. 
     
-P-A-G-E-412
    
  140 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
‘At the Clarke institution instruction is given only by means of articulation, lip 
reading, writing, andreading. For school training there are primary, grammar, and 
high school courses of study. Of the older boys 21 were instructed in cabinet, work, 
with encouraging proficiency. A special feature in the work of the year was an im- 
proved method of dealing with beginners, in giving 2 or 3 months to articulation and 
lip reading of elementary sounds and combinations, which was followed by learning 
of language, always spoken before written. At the close of the year such pupils had 
a vocabulary of 600 or 700 words. The substitution of the word “ mute” for “dumb” 
is urged as describing this class of unfortunates. Received from the Clarke fund, 
$16,885; from the State, $14,501. For statistics, see Table XVIII of the appendix. 
The Horace Mann School, a public school of Boston, in charge of the school com- 
mittee, differs from the other institutions of its kind in being a day school, which, it 
is claimed, has some advantages in the influence of home surroundings. The work 
of the school has been similar to that in previous years, with a few changes suggested 
by experience in the same line as those spoken of in the Clarke Institution, chiefly 
inthe younger classes. Enrolled during the year, 88, 51 from Boston, 36 trom adjacent 
towns, and 1 from another State, leaving at the close of the year 82 pupils. 
At the New England Industrial School for the Education of Deaf-Mutes, Beverly, in- 
struction is given in articulation and lip reading, with good results, in connection with 
the use of signs, which is regarded as facilitating the teaching of the art of speaking. 
Articulation will hereafter be made the special feature. Attendance during the year, 
20, 12 boys and 8 girls, as in 1883. The boys have done good work on the farm; the 
girls have done house work and sewing, some having learned the use of the sewing 
machine, Buildings and grounds have been much improved. As yet there are no 
shops for boys, but an accumulating fund, it is thought, will soon furnish them. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind gives to blind youth 
of either sex instruction similar to that given in the best common schools, with such 
industrial training as can be added. Since 1869, the State annually appropriates 
$30,000, for which the school gratuitously educates all such blind indigent cbildren as 
the governor may designate. Reading by touch is encouraged by all possible means. 
One evening in the week is devoted by most of the pupils to the perusal of works of 
various kinds in embossed types, including history, biography, poetry, science, phi- 
losophy, and belles letters. Music is also carefully taught. All advanced pupils take 
lessons in the normal classes, where they learn the best methods adopted in their pro- 
fession. For statistics, see Table XIX of the appendix. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
Feeble-minded youth receive training in the State schdol at South Boston and in 
the private one at Amherst, those heretofore noted at Barre and F'ayville not reporting 
for the two current years. 
The Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded, South Boston, gives free instruction 
to children of the State whose friends are unable to pay for their care. Thus far it 
has only attempted to provide for children, keeping them from 2 to 3 years, which, in 
the majority of cases, has proved sufficient to effect a marked improvement in their 
mental and physical condition. School, workshop, sewing room, drill, and hours of 
recreation combine their influences for good. Of 144 inmates, 55 were girls; 89, boys. 
A farm was bought and stocked during the year and 16 of the older boys were trans- 
ferred to it. The legislature, at its last session, established a department of the school 
as an asylum for idiots who are beyond school age. 
The Family Schoot for Delicate and Nervous Children, Amherst, opened March, 1883, 
offers a home and suitable training for children who have been enfeebled by disease 
or rendered backward and belated in habits of mind and body by constitutional pecu- 
liarities. For statistics, see Table XX of the appendix. 
CHARITABLE AND REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS. 
The State supports, in whole or in part, 3 institutions of this character. 
The State Primary School, Monson, takes both sexes from 3 to 15 years of age, and 
under industrial and Christian training prepares them to be put into homes in the 
country, while the feeble ones are retained in the school. In 1883, there was a total 
of 727 inmates; in 1883~’84, 644. The children behaved better than in any previous 
year. 
By vote of the legislature of 1884 the State Reform School, after September 30, takes 
the name of the Lyman School for Boys, Westboro’, in recognition of an endowment 
of $72,500, made by Hon. Theodore Lyman, at whose suggestion the age for commit- 
ment is limited to 15 years, thus excluding such as have become hardened by a course 
of vice, who have heretofore caused incalculable harm among the younger boys. 
During 1882~83 there were 247 in school; in 188384 there were 274. About one- 
third of the boys of the better class live in family houses of from 25 to 50 and work

\ 
on the land. Each family includes a man, wife, and a female teacher. Here the 
boys eat at the same table, cook their own food, and have no intercourse with the 
boys in the main building or in the other families. The others, of the harder class, 
live in the main building and work in the chair and shoe shops, in the laundry, and 
sewing room. The schools are said to have been in charge of earnest and faithful 
teachers and the boys to have made satisfactory progress in their studies. 
The Stale Industrial School for Girls was opened at Lancaster, 1856, on the family 
plan, on which itis still conducted. In 1883 there were 129 inmates in all; in 1884, 165, 
Girls committed ignorant of almost everything but the vernacular of the streets are 
retained only for'such a time as will seem to justify sending them out strong enough 
to withstand temptation and earn their living. They are employed in general house- 
work, laundry, and kitchen work, and are taught to make and mend their garments 
and knit stockings. They are also employed at the lighter work of gardening, fruit 
picking, gathering vegetables for the families, and care of the driveways and lawns. 
There have been no escapes from the school, and a feeling of contentment is said to 
have generally prevailed. 
For statistics of private and church institutions caring for neglected and orphan 
children, see Table XXII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MASSACHUSETTS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body held its thirty-ninth annual session at Boston, December 27-29, 1883, C. 
P. Rugg, of New Bedford, presiding. 
Among the subjects before the general meeting were ‘The recess question,” ‘‘ What 
can be done for temperance in our public schools?” and ‘‘ Why donot more pupils at- 
tend our high schools?” 
In the high school section, J. O. Noris in the chair, the following topics were dis- 
cussed: ‘‘The inductive method as applied to elementary instruction in Latin” and 
“ Chemistry in the high schools.” : 
In the grammar school section, M. F. King in the chair, the subjects were ‘ Prac- 
tical work in the school room,” “ Reading,” and ‘‘ The teaching of history: its aims 
and purpose.” 
‘The primary school section, O. P. Bruce presiding, considered three topics: (1) 
“How far can Kindergarten methods be adapted to primary schools?” (2) ‘‘ Expedi- 
ents found helpful in daily school life,” and (3) ‘The threefold purpose of school 
life: knowledge, mental activity, and good conduct,” followed by another paper on 
this topic, which stated that the educator creates nothing in the children, but develops 
wisely what is already in existence; the educator’s needs are a ‘sanctified common 
sense” and careful professional training for teaching the primary schools. 
The general meeting then resumed its session and considered ‘‘The moral influence 
of machinery,” “ Education of the feelings,” and ‘‘'The great Northwest,” when, hay- 
ing elected its officers and passed the usual resolutions, the association adjourned. 
ART TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
Tho Industrial Art Teachers’ Association of Massachusetts held its second annual 
meeting at Boston, December 27, 1883, a large number of teachers being present, 
Henry Hitchings, of Boston, in the chair. The session was opened by an essay on 
“Teaching drawing in the high schools,” by Miss C. Webster, of the Girls’ High School, 
Boston, and was discussed by a large number of the teachers present. Mr. E. Colby, 
director of drawing in the public schools of Lawrence, then spoke on the question of 
“Teaching scientific perspective in day schools,” taking the ground that it is not ad- 
visable, owing to limitation of time and the depth of study required. The president 
then spoke on ‘‘The teaching of design in day schools,” stating that at present no 
such scheme of teaching was authorized in the Boston public schools. A simple and 
consistent method would be desirable. After a discussion of this topic’ officers for 
the ensuing year were chosen and the association adjourned. 
MASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CLASSICAL AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
This body held its seventeenth annual meeting at Boston, April 11-12, 1884. 
The subjects for consideration were “English literature in high schools,” ‘The 
value of modern Greek as an introduction to the study of ancient Greek,” ‘The study 
of Greek,” and “ Desirable changes in the programs of secondary schools.” 
In presenting this subject President C. W. Eliot, of Harvard University, said that 
we have to take cognizance of the fact that entirely new constituents have been forced 
into secondary education by the progress of knowledge. French and German must 
now bestudied. Harvardis a unitas tothe desirability of having students read French 
and German, and so are scientific and classical instructors, as no extended studies in 
any department of knowledge can now be made without an acquaintance with these 
languages. With the exception of botany, the literature of science is not now relegated

4 
tothe Latin tongue. This alone should fundamentally change the modern methods of 
secondary education. The present policy of always beginning with Latin is an in- 
heritance from mediaeval times, when Latin was throughout Europe the medium of 
all advanced thought. Unfortunately, he says, we have no experimental knowledge 
on this subject, and for this we must look to the secondary schools, though it take a 
generation to decide what is best. 
Directly relating to this topic was a paper by Miss Alice E. Freeman, president of 
Wellesley College, on ‘Admission to college on certificate of the preparatory school.” 
In the discussion of this subject it was asked how long it could be possible for col- 
leges and secondary schools to remain at cross purposes in the matter of entrance ex- 
aminations. It, was resolved ‘‘that, in the opinion of the association, the want of 
an understanding and of effective codperation between the teachers of the prepara- 
tory and high schools and the faculties of colleges is a serious evil; and that a mect- 
ing of delegates from this association with representatives of New England colleges, 
to consider matter of common educational interest, would be productive of good.” 
After a full discussion of this question and the consideration of: ‘‘ How shall we 
supply ment the ordinary English high school course?” and ‘‘The high school in its 
relations to business,” the association adjourned, 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
DANIEL C. BROWN, A. M. 
This gentleman, a teacher for half a century and for twenty-nine years master of 
Bowdoin School, Boston, Mass., died July 3, 1824, aged 69 years 9 months and 29 
days. Mr. Brown, born at Kingston, N. H., 1815, showed, when a child, the same 
good traits that honored him as a man; he received his earlier education at Kingston 
and Exeter Academies ; studied medicine, but finally gave up this profession for teach- 
ing, which he never regretted. After teaching with success at Arlington, Vt., he came 
to Boston in 1854 and was for some years associated with the now venerable Joshua 
Bates as a submaster in the Brimmer School; then was made master of the Bowdoin 
School, which position he held till near his death. Taking advantage of the means 
which Boston offers, he studied early and late, receiving the degree of a. M. from Mid- 
dlebury College, Vermont. 
No better idea of the man and his life work can be given than in the resolutions 
adopted by the Boston Masters’ Association, commemorative of Mr. Brown: ‘That in 
the death of Mr. Brown there has fallen from our ranks a faithful teacher, a safe coun- 
sellor, an upright citizen, and a true friend.”

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistical summary indicates marked progress: The enrolment in public and 
private schools combined shows an increase of 17,905, this number being 1,572 more 
than the increase in youth of school age ; there were 111 more districts that maintained 
public schools, against 96 new districts; and 163 school-houses were built, giving 
accommodations to 13,473 more children. The average salary of teachers of either sex 
was advanced and the average length of school term was increased by 4 days. The 
State superintendent, in his report for 1883 (the latest printed one received), says that 
uniformity of text books is demanded, that better supervision of the schools is needed, 
and that more stringent measures should be enacted to secure from all school officers 
     
-P-A-G-E-416
  144 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF oe 
and teachers a strict observance of the laws concerning their official duties, especially 
as to making reports, employing teachers, and disbursing school funds. He also says 
that the compulsory school law should be made more effective, and thinks the dis- 
tribution of the primary school interest fund on the basis of percentage of attendance 
would, under proper restrictions, secure a larger school attendance. : 
ADMINISTRATION. | 
The school system is administered by a State superintendent of public instruction, 
elected by the people for 2 years; aState board of education, elected for 6 years, of 
which the superintendent is a member and secretary ex officio; and a board of regents 
of the University of Michigan, elected for 8 years. 
The local officers are county boards of 3 school examiners, to determine the qualifi- 
cations of persons purposing to teach in public schools ; township boards of 3 school 
inspectors, whose title indicates their work ; and district boards of 6 trustees for graded 
school districts and of 3 for ungraded ones, to look after the educational interests of 
their districts, specify the studies to be pursued, prescribe the text books to be used, 
and elect the teachers. The county boards are elected by the chairmen of the town- 
sbip boards of inspectors of their counties; the other boards, by the voters of their 
township or district, in each case for 3-year terms, with annual change of one-third. 
Public schools are free to all residents of school age without distinction of race or 
color, and no separate school for any race is allowed. Schools must be unsecfarian 
and must be taught at least 9 months in districts having 800 or more youth of school 
age, at least 5 months in districts having from 30 to 800, and 3 months in smaller 
districts. The State educational system includes graded, ungraded, and high schools; 
township and district school libraries; county teachers’ institutes; a State teachers’ 
association; State normal school, university, and agricultural college; institutions 
for the deaf and dumb and the blind; 2 reform schools; and a public school for de- 
pendent and neglected children. 
  SCHOOL FINANCES. } 
Public schools are sustained from the income of a State primary school fund, from 
a township tax of 1 mill on $1 (part of whichis for the support of libraries), and from 
taxes voted by the districts, of such amount as is considered necessary by the district 
boards, provided that in districts having less than 30 scholars it must not exceed 
$50 a month (including amounts received from 1 mill tax and primary school fund) 
for the period during which schoo is taught in such district. | 
NEW LEGISLATION. | 
The legislature of 1883 reénacted, with additions, its former law providing for the 
compulsory education of children in certain cases. Every parent or other person 
having charge of a child 8 to 14 years of age is required to send such child to a 
public school at least 4 months in each year, 6 weeks of which must be consecutive, 
unless excused by the school officers for good reasons. Under this law no child under 
14 years of age may be employed by any person, company, or corporation to labor 
in any business unless such child has attended school at least 4 months of the pre- 
ceding year. Provision was made the same year for instruction in every school in 
physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and 
other stimulants upon the human system; and after the 1st of September, 1884, 
teachers’ certificates are to be withheld from applicants who are not qualified to give 
instruction in this respect. Text books on this subject must have the joint approval 
of the State board of education and the State board of health. Contiguous districts 
having together more than 100 youth of school age were, under another law, author- 
ized to unite and form a graded school district if two-thirds of the qualified voters 
attending the annual meetings of each district should pronounce in favor of such 
union, | 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. | 
The city of Detroit has a board of education of 12 members and Grand Rapids one 
of 16. Other cities have boards of 6 trustees elected for three years. Superintend- 
ents are employed in the larger cities and many of the smaller ones.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Adrian in 1883~84 had 5 school buildings, with 27 rooms and 1,588 sittings for 
study, valued at $104,000. The schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were 
taught 1924 days by 2 men and 29 women, including 2 special teachers of drawing and 
penmanship. Counting the 1,046 pupils enrolled in the public schools and 365 in 
private and church schools, there were still 1,058 youth of school age (4-20) not at- 
tending any school. 
Ann Arbor tor 1882-83 reported little change in the school statistics. The numbers 
enrolled and in daily attendance were somewhat below those of the preceding year, 
due, it is said, to the prevalence of disease. The schools were taught 197 days. Esti- 
who enrolment in private and church schools, 200. Valuation of school property, 
160,000. Bay City in 1883-84 reported 3,900 youth in public and private schools, leaving 
2,862 not attending any school. The public schools were taught 193 days, in 8 build- 
ings, containing 44 study rooms, with 2,810 sittings. All the teachers employed were 
women. Music was taught by one special instructor. Expenditures were $57,393. 
School property was valued at $142,340. 
Detroit for 1882~83 gave an increase for the year of 120 in public schoal enrolment 
and a decrease of 112 in average daily attendance, with 12 more teachers and an in- 
crease of $71,807 in expenditure. The schools are grouped into three departments, 
primary, grammar, and high, each covering 4 years of study. A well organized 
eyening school, with a separate department for girls, had an enrolment of 430 pupils 
and-an average attendance of 250. Contrary to what had usually been the case, 
during the winter of 1882~83 the large attendance held out to the end, and on the 
last evening the school was attended by 219 pupils. Industrial or mechanical draw- 
ing was added in the evening school as a new feature of the educational system, and 
it gave excellent results. It includes the use of tools, carpenters’ work, joinery in 
its rudiments, designing patterns, modelling in clay, keeping of accounts, and other 
branches of practical industry. 
In 1883~84 the city reported 227 school rooms for study, with 14,272 sittings, being 
3,876 fewer sittings than the actual public school enrolment. Private and church 
schools enrolled 7,671 pupils, leaving 18,021 as the number of youth not under school 
instruction, An evening school was maintained 74 nights in the year, with 605

Last Saginaw in 1882~’83 increased its school population by 283, its enrolment by 
2, and its average attendance by 176. Music and drawing were included in the course 
throughout. The schools were taught 192 days, in 11 buildings, with accommoda- 
tions for 3,200 pupils. Enrolment in evening school for boys, 133; average attend- 
ance, 35. Enrolled in private schools, 484. } 
For 188384 there was an increase of 342 in youth of school age, of 362 in enrol- 
ment, and of 420 in average attendance; also, an increase of two days in length of 
term. The estimated eveciment in private schools for the year was 575. No evening 
school was reported. Value of school property, $212,000. 
Flint for 1803-’84 gives about the same school population as in 1881-82, with a 
moderate increase in enrolment and average attendance. The schools were classed as 
primary, grammar, and high and were taught 195 days in 7 buildings, with 1,893 
sittings for study, valued, with all other school property, at $129,100. Enrolment in 
private and church schools, 175. | 
Grand Rapids for 1882~’83 showed an increase of 612 in school population, of 656 in 
enrolment, and of 334 in average attendance. The schools were taught 193 days by 
34 more teachers than in 1881, 3 being special teachers of music, drawing, and pen- 
manship. Estimated value of school property, $519,600. In view of the great amount 
of truancy existing, the superintendent regretted that the school accommodations 
were so inadequate as to prevent the enforcement of the new truant law. 
In 1883~'84 the increase in the school census was 161 over the preceding year, and 
that of average daily attendance in public schools, 696. One new building was erected, 
costing, with furnishings, $17,649, and the speedy erection of 3 more was earnestly 
recommended by the. building committee. Evening schools were maintained, with 
the usual fluctuating attendance.. Out of an enrolment in 12 weeks of 226, there was 
an average nightly attendance of but 85. | 
Muskegon for 1882~83 reports a steady growth of public schools, with 403 more 
pupils than ever before. The per cent. of average attendance slightly exceeded the 
previous maximum and the per cent. of tardiness was much less. The schools are 
classed as primary, grammar, and high, with one ungraded school. Much attention 
was given to vocal music throughout the course. { 
An increase of 582 over the preceding year appears in the enrolment of 1883~84, the 
largest in the history of the city. One reason for the increase is said to be the en- 
forcement of the compulsory law through a truant agent. An evening school was 
taught, with an attendance of over 250. The advisability of introducing some kind 
of industrial work into the schools finally led a few philanthropic ladies to volunteer 
their services in conducting a sewing school on Saturday of each week. The number 
desiring to attend was so large that it was found necessary to divide the class, one 
half coming in the forenoon, the other half in the afternoon. The classes were kept 
up with full attendance till the close of the year. 
Port Huron for 1882~’83 showed an increase of 15 in school population and of 21 in 
enrolment. The schools were taught 197 days, in 4 buildings, with 1,500 sittings for 
study, valued, with sites, &c., at $88,000. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 
For 1883~84 there was an increase of 409 in youth of school age and of 45 in en- 
rolment, but the average attendance had decreased by 40 since 183182. Enrolment 
in private and church schools, 300, Value of school property, $93,000. : 
Saginaw public schools for 1883~84 were taught 195 days, in 6 buildings, with ac- 
commodations for 1,857 pupils. The schools were graded and employed 2 special 
teachers in music and drawing. School property was valued at $105,000. Enrolment 
in private and church schools, 600. |

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. | 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. | 
Teachers not graduates of the State Normal School must have certificates of quali- 
fication from the county examiners of their county or from the State board of educa~ 
tion. Thecounty certificates, valid only in the county where issued, are of three grades, 
good for 1, 2, and 3 years. State certificates are valid throughout the State for 10 
years. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State Normal School, Ypsilanti, presents 4 courses of instruction, scientific, lit-
-P-A-G-E-419
  
  MICHIGAN. 147 
erary, language, and English, from which students may choose. The English course 
covers 3 years; the others, 4. A special 4-year conrse with music is given, in which 
students are trained in harmony, voice culture, and solo singing, instrumental music 
being elective. 
The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in its department of the science and the art 
of teaching, presents 5 elective courses: the art of teaching and governing, the science 
of education, school supervision, history of education, and the teachers’ seminary, each 
covering 4 years. ‘Tho last course is for the study and discussion of special topics in 
the history and philosophy of education. It offers, besides facilities for studying the 
art of teaching and governing, instruction in methods of general school room practice, 
in the art of grading and arranging courses of study, and in the conduct of institutes. 
There were 113 students enrolled in this department during 1833684, 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Both Adrian College and Hillsdale College offer a 2-year course in normal training, 
and Olivet gives 3 courses, viz, an elementary course of 2 years, the same course 
with an additional year as a full English course, and a language course of 4 years, the » 
last offering a choice between ancient languages and German and French. There 
was also a summer normal class continuing 5 weeks. 
The catalogue of Battle Creek College seems to indicate that the normal department 
has been dropped, as no notice of it appears. 
Training schools are included in the city school systems of Detroit and East Saginaw. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The institutes in 1883 and 1884 are said to have been generally better attended and 
to have awakened more interest than ever before. Under the new law there is added 
to the standing of teachers 1 per cent. for each day’s attendance; teachers also aro 
permitted to draw pay during institute attendance, although their schools may be in 
session. In 1883 institutes were held in 65 counties, with a total enrolment of 5,758; 
one of these was a State institute held under the direction of the State superintendent 
and in which the program for the county institutes is discussed and determined. Of 
the teachers present 43 held State, 99 normal, 312 first, 487 second, 3,374 third grade, 
and 140 special certificates. Normal school instruction had been received by 1,495, 
and 1,261 were without experience in teaching. A marked decrease was noted in 
the atteudance of teachers holding higher grade certificates, but a still larger increase 
in that of those holding third grade certificates, showing that the institutes were 
reaching that class of teachers most in need of normal instruction. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Michigan School Moderator, a weekly journal published at Grand Rapids, con- tinued to be the official organ of public instruction and the chief medium for the dif- fusion of educational information throughout the State. It was in its fifth year in 
1883~84, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Any school district containing 100 or more children of school age may, by a two- 
thirds vote of the qualified electors present at any annual meeting, organize as a graded 
school district. The board of trustees of any graded school district, when so ordered. 
by a vote of the district, must establish a high school and determine the qualifications 
for admission to it. High school departments were reported in 60 graded school dis- 
tricts in 1882~83, with a total enrolment of 7,021 pupils. Detroit high schools report 
excellent and progressive work in their 4-year English, classical, Latin, and English- 
preparatory courses. A commercial course was established at the beginning of the 
year and pursued with satisfactory results. The schools hadan enrolment in 186384 
of 509 pupils, including 76 graduate students, and 75 were graduated in June, 1884, 
a class of 26 having been sent out the January preceding. The common English course, 
the preparatory English, the classical course, and the Latin-scientific course in the 
Grand Rapids high school cover 4 years; the scientific and engineering course and the 
courses in French and German, 3 years each. Attendance for the year, 458, 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, a part of the public educational system of 
the State, sustained from the proceeds of the United States land grants and from 
State appropriations, aims to complete the work begun in the public schools by fur- 
nishing facilities for a liberal general education and for the thorough study of med- 
icine, pharmacy, law, and dentistry. Its privileges are gratuitously extended to 
   
-P-A-G-E-420
  148 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
men and women alike who are qualified for admission, whether residents of the State 
or not. In the department of literature, science, and the arts, different lines of study 
lead to the degrees of A. B., B. S., and LIT. B., to the corresponding masters’ degrees, 
and to 3 degrees in engineering. In the undergraduate courses the studies are for 
the first 2 years required, but at the beginning of the third year students are allowed 
almost unlimited freedom of choice. The advanced studies of the school of political 
science, noticed in 1882, are among the electives which are not taken till after the com- 
pletion of the required studies of the first 2 years; and these electives, comprising 12 
courses in political and constitutional history, 8 in economic sciences, 3 in social, san- 
itary, and educational science, and 6 in constitutional administration and international 
law, may be chosen by other undergraduates as well as by those belonging to the 
school. | 
The number of women attending in 1883 was 170, of whom 107 were in literary 
studies and the others in medicine, law, pharmacy, and dentistry. 
The university received in 1882~83 $37,200 from the State and several gifts from 
friends, among them $2,500 from one who withholds his name, for the purchase of his- 
torical works, and $6,500 from Mr. James McMillan, of Detroit, for the purchase of a 
most valuable Shakespeare library, including a choice collection made by Hon. E. H. 
Thomson, of Flint. In 1883~84 a bequest was received of a collection of art material 
comprising about 600 pictures and 30 pieces of marble, valued at $200,000, from Henry 
C. Lewis, of Coldwater, a condition being that Mrs. Lewis might, if she pleased, re- 
tain possession of the collection during her life. 
Of 8 other institutions in the State claiming collegiate rank, 2, Battle Creek and 
Grand Traverse, appear to be doing no real college work. The remaining colleges 
all present classical courses of study of 4 years, and all but Hope College, scientific 
courses of equal length, Adrian and Hillsdale adding a philosophical course, Albion 
and Kalamazoo a Latin scientific, Adrian and Olivet a special course for ladies, and 
Adrian and Hillsdale business courses. 
The new plan of study adopted in Aljion College in 1881-82, in which the study of 
modern languages precedes the study of ancient, has worked satisfactorily. This 
method, claimed by its friends to be the natural one, was fully introduced into the 
two lower classes, and, as far as practicable, into those which had already completed 
a portion of the course on the old plan. Many young men and women have Seen at- 
paced to the institution by this system and the results seem to justify the adoption 
of the plan. 
Hope College, under charge of the Reformed Church, received in 1883-84 from vari- 
ous friends $4,582, partly to defray current expenses, the remainder to aid in endow- 
ment. 
Hillsdale College (Free Will Baptist), was given $3,362.04 by various friends, the 
interest to be used for the equipment of a biological library and other special objects; 
also, to increase the general endowment. 
For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a summary, see a corresponding 
table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPEPIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Women are admitted to all the colleges of the State on equal terms with men. 
Further provision for them is made in Michigan Female Seminary, Kalamazoo, au- 
thorized by law to confer collegiate degrees, which reported 37 undergraduate 
students and 10 in a preparatory department in 1883~84, 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Michigan State Agricultural College, Lansing, besides other branches necessary 
to a good education, teaches surveying, levelling, laying out of grounds, mechanics as 
applied to implements, building, stock breeding, agricultural chemistry, horticulture, 
and such practical applications of science as are specially useful to the farmer. The 
farm comprises 676 acres, of which 10 are devoted to experiments, 180 to a systematic 
rotation of crops, and 110 to woodland pasture. Students are required to labor three. 
hours each week day, except Saturday; most of their work is paid for, the maximum 
rate being 8 cents an hour. The degree of B.s. was conferred in 1883 on 29 young 
men and 1 young woman ; that of M.s.,on 5 young men. 
Scientific courses, as already noted, are found in the State university and in all the 
other colleges of the State except one, the State university making provision for 
graduate study leading to the degree of master of science, as well as offering technical 
courses in civil, mechanical, and mining engineering. 
For statistics of scientific schools and departments of colleges, see Tables IX and X 
of the appendix, and for summaries, see corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding.

  MICHIGAN, 149 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological instruction was given in Adrian College, Adrian (Methodist Protestant), 
and Hillsdale College, Hillsdale (Free Will Baptist), in courses of 3 years to 56 stu- 
dents, 43 of them in the latter, including 38 undergraduates and 5 resident graduates. 
Battle Creek College (Seventh Day Baptist) offers a biblical course of study, the aim 
of which is to lead students to a familiarity with the Bible before all other writings, 
making use of the latter only as they may serve to explain the former. Whether or 
not any students were engaged in these studies does not appear from the catalogue. 
The law department of the University of Michigan aims to give students a thorough 
preparation in the several branches of constitutional, international, maritime, com- 
mercial, and criminal law, medical jurisprudence, and the jurisprudence of the United 
States. A spacious building is devoted to its accommodation, with debating and 
society rooms, and the conveniences of the department are exceptionally good. Dur- 
ing 1883-24 the course of instruction was extended so as to include the entire college 
year of 9 months. Opportunity is thus afforded the law students to attend without 
additional expense some of the lectures delivered in the department of literature, 
science, and arts. An admission examination is required of candidates for a degree, 
unless they are graduates of some collegiate institution, high school, or institution of 
corresponding grade. 
The medical schools are the department of medicine and surgery of the University 
of Michigan, Detroit Medical College, the Homeopathic Medical College of the Uni- 
versity of Michigan, and Michigan College of Medicine, Detroit. Both schools of the 
university agree in requiring of candidates for their diplomas a 3-year graded course, 
each year (of 9 months) being divided into two semesters, which close with written 
examinations on the work gone over. Women are admitted, and their instruction is, 
in all respects, equal to that of men. An examination for admission is required of 
all candidates not able otherwise to prove that they are qualified for the study of 
medicine. Detroit Medical College and Michigan College of Medicine present the 
usual 3 years of study, including 2 courses of lectures; the latter, however, advises 
a 3-year graded course. Both require of applicants for admission sufficient knowl- 
edge of the branches of an English education to enable them to engage intelligently 
in the study of medicine; and this knowledge must be proved by an examination, 
if it be not shown by diplomas or certificates from some competent educational insti- 
tution.*

forming the entire labor of the institution, under the direction of competent instruc- 
tors. Boys who have merited confidence by good conduct are granted leave of ab- 
sence and are required to make satisfactory reports at stated times. The whole 
number committed to September, 1883, since opening, was 2,864. In 1882~’83 there 
were 352 boys in the school. Total expenditure for the year, $53,028, 
For full statistics, see Table XXI of appendix. 
The State Industrial Home for Girls, Adrian, one of the last established of the State 
institutions, is still in the experimental stage, but the results of its work for the firs ¢ 
3 years have been excellent. Girls between the ages of 7 and 17 are committed to it 
by the courts for any offence not punishable by imprisonment for life, and are taught. 
the common English branches, domestic work, sewing, dressmaking, &c. School 
work occupies the afternoon and an hour in the evening. Religious instruction forms 
an important part of the education, There were 159 inmates at date of report, Sep- 
tember, 1884. 
EDUCATION OF POOR AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. | 
The State Public School for Dependent Children, Coldwater, receives children 
3 to 12, training them in school studies and industries, caring for their health and 
morals, and finding homes for them in families. Up to 1883 there had been 1,200 thus 
cared for since the organization of the school, 10 years previous. Of these, 900 had 
been sent to homes, 300 remaining intheschool. A majority of the 900 were then in com- 
fortable homes, with every encouragement to develop into good citizens. The pupils 
enrolled in each of the years 1883 and 1884 was 469, of whom 131 were placed in homes 
in the former and 258 in the latter year. Whole expenditure for the two years, 
$91,794. Since the previous biennial report 34 acres of land have been added to the 
grounds. A serviceable hospital was also built and furnished during this time at a 
cost of $7,000. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. il 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Michigan State Teachers’ Association held its thirty-second annual meeting at 
Lansing, December 26-28, 1883, Prof. Estabrook presiding. The title of the president’s 
address was ‘‘ Effects of alcohol on the human system,” after which papers were read 
on ‘Courses of study for smaller high schools,” ‘‘ Methods of study of the classics,” 
“The study of the English language as a means of mental culture,” ‘‘ True education,” 
‘How can we best care for the eye, ear, and brain in school life ?” ‘‘ Defects in the 
present system of examinations,” and ‘Effective energy in teaching and grading of dis- 
trict schools.” At the closing session it was resolved that a committee be appointed, 
consisting of the State superintendent, Prof. Putnam, and President Estabrook, tocon- 
sider the subject matter of Prof. Putnam’s paper on ‘‘Grading public schools,” to wait 
upon the governor and request him to call the attention of the legislature to the sub- 
ject and recommend favorable action. It was further resolved that the subject of 
county institutes be likewise considered and presented by the committee. Otherres- 
olutions followed; after which the officers were elected for the ensuing year and the 
association adjourned. \

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistical summary for the year 1883~’84 shows an increase in all the items 
given, the per cent. of enrolment of the school population appearing to be the same le, superintendent of public instrue-

in both years. A growth of 8,589 in average daily attendance compares favorably 
with the increase of attendance in 1882~83 over that of 1881~82. In 1882~’83 there 
were 325 school-houses built, at a cost of $400,098, and in 1883~84 there were 391 
built, costing $685,072. The value of school apparatus, including seats, desks, and 
libraries, was given as $321,133 in 1882~-’83 and increased by $100,755 in the next year. 
The school libraries alone were rated at $12,612 in the former year and $23,628 in the 
latter. Of the 6,086 teachers employed in the State, 415 were normal school grad- 
uates, an increase of 162, while of those who had attended a normal school there were 
1,245, an increase of 407. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For the State there is a superintendent of public instruction appointed for 2 years 
by the governor, with the consent and advice of the senate; he is a member ex officio 
of the board of regents of the State University and secretary of the board of direc- 
tors of the State normal schools. For each county there is a superintendent of schools 
elected for every 2 years, who examines and licenses teachers. There is a board of 3 
trustees for common school districts; for independent school districts, a board of 6 
directors, which appoints 3 competent persons as school examiners, all elected for 3 
years. Women may vote and hold any office pertaining solely to the management of 
_ public schools. 
The public schools are free to all resident youth of school age (5-21) and pupils over 
21 and non-residents may be admitted on payment of tuition fees. Schools must be 
taught not less than 12 nor more than 44 weeks in each year. Teachers are permitted 
to give daily instruction in social science, good morals, and patriotism. Thirty topics 
are specified, such as cleanliness, truth, perseverance, self reliance, &c. Provision 
is made for teachers’ institutes and normal training schools. The State provides for 
the uniformity of text books, certain State officers being vested with authority to 
contract for the same. r 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are sustained from the proceeds of a State school fund, from a 
county tax of 1 mill on $1, from the proceeds of liquor licenses and fines not other- 
wise appropriated, from the unclaimed proceeds arising from the sale of estrays, and 
from an optional district tax, the last to provide school-houses and sites, but not to 
exceed 8 mills on $1 in any one year for those objects. | 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Any cities of 500 or more inhabitants not under special laws may be organized into 
independent school districts, with boards of 6 directors elected by the citizens for 
terms of 3 years, with annual change of 2, A superintendent is elected by the board, 
of which he is a member ex officio and executive officer. 
Minneapolis and St. Paul are under special laws, each having a board of education 
elected by the people, that of the former city having 7 members, called school direc- 
tors; that of the latter, 12, called school inspectors; each body is subject to partial 
annual change and each is authorized to employ a superintendent, teachers, &c.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Minneapolis presents in 1883 an increase of 4,100 in youth of school age, of 2,942 in 
enrolment, and of 1,411 in average daily attendance, with 56 more teachers, including 
13 in evening schools. The schools (primary, intermediate, grammar, and high) were 
taught 185 days in 21 buildings, with 8,264 sittings for study. Special attention is 
given to drawing throughout the course. The system being industrial, the principles 
of construction, representation, and object drawing are always kept in view. Special 
teachers of music and drawing are employed, who also give instruction to the regular 
teachers in these branches, The growt of the eeccn made it necessary to build

new school-houses and enlarge old ones, at a cost of $69,405. Evening schools were 
taught 63 evenings during the year by 13 teachers; whole number of pupils enrolled, 
934; average evening attendance, 313. 
St. Paul for 1882~83, reports an increase of 929 in pupils enrolled in public schools, 
and, although the erection and improvement of school-houses gave 1,700 more sittings 
(at a cost of $156,000), many children were refused admission from lack of room. 
Evening schools were taught 101 cyenings and had 852 pupils enrolled, with an aver- 
age attendance of There were 2 private Kindergiirten, with an enrolment of 
174 children; other private schools reported 3,436 pupils. 
In 1883~84, the enrolment in public schools, including evening schools, increased, 
but the inadequate supply of accommodations still interfered with the regular attend- 
ance. The schools are graded, the entire course covering 12 years. Special teachers 
are employed in music, drawing, and penmanship throughout and in the German lan- 
guage trom the fifth grade. Physiology has been dropped from the course of study 
below the high school. Evening schools enrolled 1,264 pupils, with an average at- 
tendance of 386, the average age of pupils being 18 years. The valuation of all pub- 
lic school property was increased from $509,600 to $539,500. . 
Winona tor 1882-83 shows a decrease of 365 in enrolment in public schools and of 
39 in average attendance, with the same number of teachers. The schools were 
taught 196 days in 3 different buildings, with 1,585 sittings for study. There were 
special teachers in drawing and penmanship. Estimated enrolment in private 
schools, 500. Valuation ofall school property, $175,000. The Kindergarten at Winona 
is under the auspices of the State Normal School. 
    KINDERGARTEN, 
For statistics of 11 Kindergiirten in this State, see Table V of the appendix; fora 
summary of the attendance in them, see a corresponding table in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS, 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
  Before receiving licenses to teach in the public schools candidates must pass an ex- 
amination to show their fitness for the work. In ordinary districts this examination 
is conducted by county superintendents; in independent districts, by examiners ap- 
pointed by the boards of education. After examining applicants in the common 
school branches (including the history of the United States and the practical facts 
of hygiene) and after testing their general knowledge and ability to impart instruc- 
tion, county superintendents are authorized to issue three grades of certificates, the 
first valid in the county for 2 years, the second for 1 year, and the third (valid in 
the district only) for 6 months. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The 3 State normal schools, at Mankato, St. Cloud, and Winona, prepare teachers 
for the public schools, giving free tuition to all persons who pledge themselves to 
teach two years in the State after graduation. The schools graduate from 2 courses: 
elementary or preparatory, of 3 years, and academic or advanced, of 4, the 2 courses 
combined covering 4 years. Mankato and Winona add professional studies of 1 year 
for those who graduate from either course. These studies include the history of edu- 
cation, psychology, mental science, methods and philosophy of teaching, and practice 
teaching. All have model schools thoroughly graded and classified, designed to afford 
students ample opportunity for observation and practice, Winona having also a well 
organized Kindergarten. ‘The schools, in 1883-84, had a total enrolment of 1,375, of 
whom 672 were in the normal departments and 87 graduated. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Qf the summer school for teachers conducted at the Minnesota University in 1782 
no notice is given in the catalogue of 1883~84. The city school system of St. Paul 
includes a training department to prepare teachers for the public schools of that city. 
It had, in 1883~84, an enrolment of 112 students, and 23 were graduated, of whom 
18 engaged in teaching at once. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The number of State institutes held during the year was 52, an increase of 11; the 
number of teachers enrolled 3,231, an increase of 1,126. Of this number, 164 held 
first grade certificates, 1,234 second grade, and 767 third grade, the remainder hold- 
ing no certificates,

EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
School Education, formerly the Journal of Education, published at St. Paul, cou- 
tinued to give valuable information in regard to educational matters in the State. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. i 
- The State high school board, consisting of the governor of the State, the superin- 
tendent of public instruction, and the president of the State university, had under 
its supervision in 1883~’84 61 high schools. The total enrolment was 2,613, of ~vyhich 
number 718 were non-residents receiving instruction free of charge. The reports of 
the schools and the results of their work prove that they are, with a few exceptions, 
in a prosperous condition, a good proportion of them holding the first rank as to effi- 
ciency and scholarship. Over nine-tenths of the principals and superintendents are 
graduates of college and have had successful experience as teachers. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (non-sectarian), offers free tuition alike 
to students of either sex who are over 14 years of age and able to pass the required 
examinations. The collegiate department comprises colleges of agriculture; mechanic. 
arts; science, literature, and arts; medicine ; and law (this department not yet organ- 
ized), all leading to appropriate degrees. There was an attendance of 147 students 
in 188384, under 21 instructors. The State appropriated $23,000 for the year. In- 
acon productive fund, $35,000; value of all property belonging to the university, 
000. 
The other colleges reporting for 1883~84 were Hamline University, Hamline 
(Methodist Episcopal), with classical and scientific courses of 4 years ; Carleton College, 
Northfield (Congregational), with 4-year classical, scientific, literary, and English 
courses ; and St. John’s University, Collegeville (Roman Catholic), with classical, 
scientific, commercial, medical, and ecclesiastical courses. All give preparatory 
training and instruction in music. Carleton gave increased attention to drawing 
and painting during the year, and an art department was projected. 
For statistics of colleges reporting, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary 
thereof, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The University of Minnesota, Carleton College, and Hamline University offer the 
same privileges to young women as to young men. For statistics of other institutions 
for the higher education of women, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary of 
them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State university in its college of agriculture adds to the last 2 years of the 
collegiate department training in agricultural chemistry, practical agriculture, hor- 
ticulture, and other sciences relating to agriculture. Its college of mechanical arts, 
also following the preliminary studies of the collegiate department, presents three 
courses of 2 years each, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and architecture. 
An artisans’ training school, established as a department of the college of mechanical 
arts, meets the needs of mechanics and others and takes. the place of the course in 
shopwork and drawing heretofore given. Evening instruction is also given in me- 
chanical drawing. | 
Carleton College, Hamline University, and St. John’s College also offer special 
scientific courses. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction continued at the ecclesiastical seminary of St. John’s Uni- 
versity, Collegeville (Roman Catholic), the Seabury Divinity School, Faribault (Prot- 
estant Episcopal), and in the theological course of the Augsburg Seminary, Minne- 
apolis (Evangelical Lutheran); besides which the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran 
Seminary, Red Wing, presents itself in 188384. All show the customary 3-year 
course, meant to follow a high school or collegiate training if possible. For sta- 
tistics, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Medical training was given in the Minnesota College Hospital, Minneapolis, succes- 
sor to the St. Paul Medical College, under 21 professors and 1 demonstrator in 1882~83
-P-A-G-E-427
  MINNESOTA. ; 155 
and under 1 fewer in 1883~84, The regular course was 3 years, of 19 weeks annually. 
For admission there was an examination in ordinary school studies, United States his- 
tory, and physics, except where a degree in arts or sciences, a certificate from a high 
school or other reputable seminary, or a teacher’s certificate was presented; for grad- 
uation, attendance pn 2 regular courses, full age, 3 years of study, and evidence of 
good moral character, with dissection of each part of a cadaver. 
The University of Minnesota in 1883 organized at Minneapolis a medical depart- 
ment, which, in view of the multiplication of medical schools, is to be an examining, 
not a teaching, body. As a State examining board it tests the genuineness of medical 
diplomas presented to it by persons desiring to practise medicine in the State and 
authorizes the holders of such as are found genuine to enter upon practice. Asa 
medical faculty, it examines in letters and science those who seek the university medi- 
cal degrees, and grants the diploma of bachelor of medicine to such accepted candidates 
as pass successive annual examinations during 2 or 3 years, according to their previous 
preparation: that of M. D. to bachelors of 3 years’ professional practice after gradua- 
tion and to any M. D. of other recognized medical colleges that presents and defends 
successfully a thesis on some medical theme. As far as can be judged from the sched- 
ule these examinations seem to be exceptionally thorough. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
| EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Minnesota Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Faribault, free to 
deaf-mutes of the State 10 to 25 years of age, reports for 1883~-’84 an enrolment of 130 
pupils, ee which number 60 were girls, under 9 instructors, 4 being semi-mutes. The 
school was founded in 1863, since which time 336 pupils have received instruction. 
Besides the common school branches the children are taught cooperage, shoemaking, 
printing, tailoring, plain sewing, and dressmaking. About one-third of them re- 
ceive instruction in articulation. The institution owns 65 acres of land, valued, with 
buildings, at $200,000, 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The School for the Blind, Faribault, is now occupying its commodious new building 
erected in 1883~84, and it is well equipped and furnished. In addition to common 
school studies, instruction is given in vocal and instrumental music. The industries 
comprise broom making for the boys; bead work, hand and machine sewing, knitting, 
and crocheting for the girls. The average num ber of pupils during the year was 30. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Minnesota Training School for Idiots and Imbeciles, Faribault, had in 1883~84 
an attendance of 45 boys and 15 girls, an increase of 19 over 1882~83. The instruc- 
tion isin common school branches and in fancy work, sewing, &c. 
The question of affording farther and full relief for the idiotic and epileptic children 
of the State has given the directors of the institution much embarrassment. Applica- 
tions for admission continue largely to exceed accommodations, and a more complete 
separation of the totally demented from the merely weak minded is demanded. Ad- 
ditional buildings are needed and an appropriation sufficient for the erection of two 
for adults with moderate intellect is recommended. 
} REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Minnesota Reform School, St. Paul, aims to educate and reform youthful 
criminals and obstinately bad boys. To aid-in this, it gives instruction in common 
school studies and in carpentry, tinning, tailoring, shoemaking, and farming. The 
shops are not managed for profit, but to impart actual industrial training, so that 
the boys, when sent out, find no difficulty in obtaining employment. Three separate 
schools are maintained, one for the older, one for the younger boys, and one for the 
girls, with the same division as to families. Since organization, in 1867, about 550 
inmates have gone out from the institution, and the managers believe that much less 
than 10 per cent. have returned to a criminal life. The average number of pupils in 
the school for 1883~84 was 128. ' 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MINNESOTA STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The eighth annual session of the Minnesota State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Minneapolis, December 26-28, 1883. The attendance of principals and upper grade 
teachers was better than that of the previous year. Among the subjects presented 
were “Education in its moral aspect,” “The relation of education to crime, pau-
-P-A-G-E-428
    
{ i 
156 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
perism, and production,” ‘Moral training,” ‘School libraries as a means of cul- 
tivating a taste for good reading and as an auxiliary to the regular instruction,” 
and ‘Professional preparation.” Following this, State Superintendent Kiehle pre- 
sented arguments in favor of the granting of State certificates as recognitions of 
professional skill and preparation. After some discussion, a resolution indorsing the 
granting of such certificates passed unanimously, and the matter was referred to a 
committee with instructions to take such action, in conjunction with the State 
Sa peusendent, as to secure, if possible, proper legislation to carry the idea into 
effect. 
CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The third annual convention of county superintendents met at St. Paul, Decem- 
ber 29, 1883, 30 superintendents being present at the opening. State Superintendent 
Kiehle called the convention to order and delivered a brief address of welcome. The 
first discussion was on the length of teachers’ institutes, most of the superintendents 
favoring the present short term of 1 week. Superintendent Sperryread a paper on ‘‘ Im- 
provement of the grade of teachers by better methods of examination and by estab- 
lishing a better standard,” the discussion of which brought out many points indicat- 
ing that present methods of examination and grading may be improved. At the re- 
quest of the State superintendent, a committee of 3 was appointed to confer with 
him on the methods of examination, the preparation of questions, and the grading of 
certificates. A paper was read entitled ‘‘How may we secure greater permanence of 
teachers in our country schools?” The superintendent from Norman opened the dis- 
cussion by saying it was simply impossible to get good normal teachers to accept the 
joor pay and poorer accommodations offered in the frontier counties. An interest- 
ing discussion was held on the reading of the paper ‘‘ How shall schools be inspected 
with a view to the best results?” After which the convention adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show a large increase in the number of each race enrolled in public 
schools and in average daily attendance, notwithstanding a ‘comparatively small one 
in youth of legal school age. More than 59 per cent. of the school population were, 
in fact, enrolled in public schools, and more than 34 per cent. were in average daily 
attendance, an increase during the year of more than 11 per cent. enrolled and of 
about 4 per cent. in average attendance. There was a corresponding increase in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
  158 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
number of teachers employed for each race and in the amount expended on the schools, 
the total for all school purposes reaching $703,876. The average length of school 
term for the State for 1882 was 75} days. In 1883 it was 2 days longer than this in the 
country districts. But fuller means for the support of public schools are required to 
render the work more effective. The superintendent, therefore, recommends that the 
poll tax be made $2 per capita instead of $1, that an allowance be made for an op- 
tional increase in the 3-mill school tax by removing the limit which fixes the minimum 
at 3 mills, and that a dog law be enacted, the fines resulting to go to the public schools. 
He also erase the establishment of a State normal school for white pupils, and asks 
of the legislature an appropriation for the purpose, stating that Dr. Curry had offered 
to defray from the Peabody fund one-third of the expenses of the establishment of 
such school, exclusive of buildings and incidentals. The superintendent reports that 
unusual interest was manifested in education during the years 1882 and 1883, and that 
public instruction was growing in the estimation of the people, as shown by their will- 
ingness to pay the school tax, their desire to extend the school term beyond 4 months, 
and their readiness to employ competent teachers. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Provision is made in the State constitution for a superintendent of public educa- 
tion, to be elected by the people for 4 years; for a State board of education of 3mem- 
bers, including the superintendent, which ischarged with the management of the school 
funds and with other duties; and for county superintendents, one in each county, 
appointed by the State board for2 years. The law requires that before any person be 
appointed county superintendent he must have a certificate from a board of exami- 
ners instituted for the purpose of ascertaining the fitness of candidates for such office, 
the examination en BEsciny first, educational qualifications, which must not be in- 
ferior to those of a first grade teacher ; second, habits and moral character; and, third, 
executive ability. Two of the 3 members of this examining board must be profes- 
sional educators or men who have had experience in school teaching. One is selected 
by the judge of the circuit court, one by the chancellor of the district, and the other 
by the board of county supervisors. The local interests of public schools are super- 
vised by trustees, a board of 3 being provided for each school. In country districts 
they are elected by the patrons of the schools; in incorporated towns, by the mayor 
and aldermen. Trustees are required to select teachers, protect school property, pro- 
vide fuel, and visit the schools at least once a month. Separate schools for white and 
colored children must be maintained, The legal term is 5 months, except when this 
would require a tax of more than $7.50 on each $1,000 of taxable property; in such 
case the term may be reduced to 4 months, the minimum length fixed by the State 
constitution. Districts that neglect to sustain schools for at least 4 months durin; 
any year forfeit their proportion of the public school moneys for such year. Eac 
county in the State constitutes a schoo) district. 
FINANCES. . 
The public schools are supported from a distributable State fund of $200,000, from 
township funds, and by municipal and county taxes, with some assistance from the 
Peabody fund. The State fund is apportioned among the several counties according 
to the number of children of school age therein. Aid was received from the Peabody 
fund during 1882 and 1883 amounting to $3,200, besides about $5,000 intended for 
the expenses of Mississippi State pupils at the Normal College, Nashville, Tenn. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
ADMINISTRATION, i 
An incorporated town of 1,000 or more inhabitants may constitute a separate school 
district if the mayor and aldermen so elect, its boundaries to be those of the town. 
For the supervision of city schools the mayor and aldermen appoint a board of 3 trust- 
ees, whose duties are similar to those of country school trustees, the county superin- 
tendent retaining the same jurisdiction over these schools as over others in the county 
and the mayor and aldermen exercising the functions otherwise belonging to county 
supervisors, STATISTICS OF VICKSBURG. 
Vicksburg, with a population in 1880 of 11,814, reported in 1882~83 3,760 youth of 
school age, with 1,320 pupils enrolled and 1,120 in average daily attendance, under 21 
teachers, 12 of the latter being women ; 1,100 sittings for study in 3 school buildings; 
all school property valued at $10,600; schools taught 170 days, at a cost of $14,830, 
all except $830 raised by taxation. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES, 
To be employed in public schools teachers must have certificates of qualification 
signed by their county superintendent, who, in conjunction with the board of super- 
visors, examines candidates for positions as teachers, and, if found qualified, gives 
them certificates of first, second, or third grade, according to their attainments, which 
certificates are valid in any part of the county for one year. The certilicate of a first 
grade teachershows that the holder is thoroughly qualified to teach the higher branches 
of English literature, natural philosophy, elements of book-keeping, and all studies 
usually taught in common schools; that of a second grade is proof of ability to teach 
the intermediate branches of arithmetic, grammar, and other common school studies; 
and that of third grade certifies as to the elementary branches. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State Normal School, Holly Springs, established in 1870 to train teachers for 
the colored public schools, presents a course of study designed to secure this object — 
and none other. All studies in the course are compulsory, ynly such being included 
as are necessary to prepare teachers for reaching the masses of the unlearned. The 
standard is raised each year to meet the increasing requirements of county superin- 
tendents. Tuition and text books are free, the school being supported by the State. 
There were 155 students in attendance during 1882~83. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Iuka Normal Institute, Iuka, first opened in 1882, reports a 4-year course of study, 
which includes drawing and music, a chemical laboratory and apparatus for illustrat- 
ing physics, a small museum of natural history, and a model school, 
Jackson College, Jackson, a normal and theological school, is one of the fifteen insti- 
tutions founded and sustained by the American Baptist Home Mission Society to 
train men for the work of the christian ministry and qualify teachers for the public 
schools. 
Normal departments are also reported in connection with Rust University, Holly 
Springs; Tougaloo University, Tougaloo, and Union Female College, Oxford. 
For statistics of normal schools reporting, see Table III of the appendix, and for a summary of these statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
It appears from a paragraph in the Educational Journal for July that over 50 county 
institutes were to be held in the State in 1884, but no more definite information as to 
this work is at hand. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
The Educational Journal started at Jackson in 1882 is now published at West. It 
is a biweekly, edited by P. W. Corr and devoted to the interests of the public schools 
of Mississippi. 
A limited amount of educational information from this State is still given in in the 
Mississippi department of the American Journal of Education, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
By a law of 1878, private academies and colleges having suitable school buildings, 
libraries of not less than 200 volumes, and a faculty of good standing are recognized 
as high schools, and pupils attending them are authorized to draw from the school fund, 
in payment of their tuition, the pro rata amount to which they are entitled. Such 
high schools and colleges are required to adopt a course of text books as nearly as 
possible in accordance with the curriculum of the University of Mississippi, so that 
students may pass from them into the university without loss of time. There is no 
information at hand as to the number of such schools in the State. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix; for summaries ot 
such statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES.

fessional instruction in its 3 departments, viz, the University High School, the de«

  160 REPORT OF TIIE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. | 
  partment of science, literature, and arts, and the department of professional educa- 
tion, this last including only a school of law. The department of science, ee 
and arts presents 5 distinct courses of study, 3 of them undergraduate and 2 graduate. 
The undergraduate courses are for the degrees of A. B., B. §., and PH. B. The first 
two, extending over 4 years, have afixed curriculum, in which all the studies are com- 
pulsory. The course for PH. B. is elective and embraces the studies of any 7 of the 
10 departments. Students not candidates for a degree may pursue a course of select 
studies under certain restrictions. The 2 graduate courses lead to the degrees of 
A. M. and PH. D., the former extending over 1 year, the latter over 2. A choice is 
offered in each between 6 special lines of study, in one of which the applicant must 
pass a satisfactory examination. Since June, 1832, women are admitted to the uni- 
versity on equal terms with men, but they must be qualified for the freshman class. 
There were 22 in attendance during 1883-84, the whole number of undergraduate 
students being 148. 
Mississippi College, Clinton, provides noregular curriculum, exceptin the preparatory 
department. Scholarship is measured, not by the time spent in college, but by the 
attainments made, and degrees are conferred when the prescribed studies have been 
mastered. The schools are those of mental and moral science, Greek, Latin, mathe- 
matics, natural science, English, modern languages, and commerce. The degrees 
conferred are those of A. B., B. S., and B. LIT. Four students were graduated in 
1884, all bachelors of science. 
Rust University, Holly Springs, continues to present a theological department, a 
classical course of 4 years, and a shorter scientific course, in which Greek and Latin 
are omitted after the sophomore year. To prepare for these it has a subacademic 
course of 4 years and an academic of 3, leading up to freshman studies. There is 
also a normal of 3 years, which is the same as the academic, except that pedagogical 
studies are substituted for Greek. Both sexes are admitted. 
For statistics of colleges, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a summary, see a cor- 
responding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Reports for 1883 or 1884 have been received from 8 institutions for the higher in- 
struction of young women, all authorized by law to confer collegiate degrees. All 
make provision for preparatory instruction and nearly all include in their course of 
study music, drawing, French, and German. 
For statistics, see ‘Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary of them, see a cor- 
responding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. . 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi, Oktibbeha County, has not 
only received from the legislature ample appropriations for the necessary buildings 
and their equipments, but also receives fair support. The property, consisting of 
lands, buildings, and appurtenances, valued at $180,000, includes 1,940 acres of land, 
of which 600 are under cultivation. There is a large supply of stock, with a full outfit 
of farm machinery and implements. Preparatory and collegiate courses afford the 
means of acquiring a thorough elementary education and a scientific and practical 
knowledge of agriculture and the mechanic arts. The degree of B.8. is conferred on 
those who complete the collegiate course, which extends over 4 years. Graduate 
courses of 2 years in agriculture, horticulture, chemistry, and botany lead to the degree 
of M. s., and students are earnestly advised to follow one of these studies. Those 
who do this are exempt from the military duty and compulsory labor imposed on all 
other undergraduates. ‘Tuition is free to residents of the State. There were 108 
students during 1883-84 in the regular collegé classes, besides 14 in irregular courses 
and 135 in the preparatory department. \ 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, Rodney, shares with the preceding the 
congressional grant for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Its prop- 
erty, valued in 1882 at about $43,000, comprises 300 acres, 125 of them under cultiva- 
tion. The courses of study are an academic of 2 years, a scientific preparatory of 2, 
and a scientific of 4. In the last there were 16 students in 1883~84. 
For full statistics of the two agricultural colleges, see Table X of the appendix, 
and for a summary of them, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given at Jackson College, Jackson, supported by the 
American Baptist Home Mission Society for training ministers and teachers, and at 
Rust University, Holly Springs, Methodist Episcopal. In this last the text books used  
-P-A-G-E-433

are mainly those prescribed by the Beveenl conference, and theological students are 
expected to take such studies from the collegiate course as are deemed expedient. 
~ Natchez Seminary, Natchez (Baptist), sends no information for 1884, nor has Bishop 
Green Associate Mission and Training School, Dry Grove, sent any for several years 
past, and it seems probable that this last has been discontinued. 
For statistics of theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appendix, and for 
a summary of them, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
rai training is provided for in the law school of the University of Mississippi, 
which, in a 2-year course, undertakes to qualify students for practice in any court in 
the State. Applicants for admission must be at least 19 years of age, and, if not 
graduates of some college, must show certificates of good moral character. No ex- 
amination for admission is mentioned. Twelve students were reported for 1883. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Jackson, established by the legislature 
and supported by the State, is open to deaf-mutes of the State who desire an educa- 
tion, boarding, tuition, books, and medical attendance being furnished free of cost, 
and,to the very poor, clothing and transportation also. Increased accommodations 
were provided in 1883 for both white and colored pupils by the erection of new build- 
ings and the improvement of the old, funds having been appropriated by the legisla- 
ture for this purpose. There were separate buildings for the two races, and at the 
date of the report colored pupils numbered 15. The whole number under instruction 
during 1882 and 1883 was 88. Since the last report instruction in articulation has 
been added to the course of study, which, besides the more elementary branches, in- 
cludes algebra, history, natural philosophy, and moral science. The employments 
taught are printing, carpentry, shoemaking, cabinet work, sewing, and cutting and 
fitting. 
ae statistics, see Table XIX of the appendix, and for a summary, see a correspond- 
ing table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Mississippi Institution for the Education of the Blind, Jackson, a free school 
sustained by the State, is open to all resident blind youth 9 to 21 years of age who 
are not incapacitated for instruction by physical, mental, or moral infirmity. Three 
departments are included, literary, musical, and industrial. The first, designed to 
give a fair English education, includes elementary branches, with history, elocution, 
geometry, physiology, and astronomy. The employments taught are broom making, 
chair seating, mattress making, upholstery, sewing by hand and machine, knitting, 
crocheting, and bead work. There were 37 pupils at date of the report for 1883, 
under 14 instructors and other employés. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION, 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Mississippi State Teachers’ Association met at Jackson, December 27, 1883, 
remaining in session two days. Among the topics discussed were technical educa- 
tion, coeducation in colleges and universities, system as it affects school work, the 
proper limit of the school age in public schools, the art of questioning as related 
to teachers, excellences and defects of the public schools, the proper limit to the 
public school curriculum, and the duties of the State in the support of public 
schools. Coeducation received more attention than any of the other topics presented, 
two papers on it being read. One was by Mrs. Annie C. Peyton, favoring separate 
education for girls; the other, by Prof. C. W. Hutson, claiming for coeducation special 
and important advantages, aside from the evident one of economy. A discussion fol- 
lowed, in which a majority of the speakers favored the views expressed by Professor 
Hutson.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. | 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State piyern tenet, in his report for 1883-84, says that for several years there 
has been a gradualimprovement in the general management and efficiency of the pub 
lic schools and that no single year has produced more marked results than the one 
just passed, 
The statistics Riven fully confirm this, showing an'increase of 7,354 in school youth, 
of 16,123 in enrolment, and of 67,620 in average daily attendance. This shows 67.75 
per cent. of school population enrolled, a gain of 1.45 per cent., while 75.46 per cent. 
of the enrolment were reported in average attendance, a gain of 10.84 percent. There 
were 311 more schools taught, 33,725 more sittings provided, and 1,219 more teachers 
employed, at a slight increase in average monthly pay. There was an increase of 
$521,086 in expenditure for pape schools and of $299,740 in the permanent fund, 
which advanced to $10,178,806, one of the largest in the United States,  
-P-A-G-E-435
  MISSOURI. 163 
The State superintendent reports 105 private and’ parochial schools in the State, 
with 518 teachers and 10,528 pupils, which last, added to the enrolment in public 
schools, shows 69.10 per cent. of the schoo! population of the State underschool instruc- 
tion, 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For general supervision of State school interests there is a board of education, com- 
posed of the governor, secretary of state, and attorney general, with a superintendent 
of public schools, elected by the people for 4-year terms. For each county there is a 
school commissioner, elected by the people biennially. For each district there is a 
board of 3 directors, elected by the qualified voters of the district for 3 years, with 
annual change of 1, which has the care of the district school property and provides 
necessary apparatus for the school rooms, fuel, and other necessary materia}. 
The public schools are free to all youth 6-20 years of age in the State, but separate 
hools must be established for colored children in districts with 16 or more such chil- 
dren, these to be under the same school officers as other schools and have the same 
advantages. When school officers fail to establish such schools, the county court is 
required to provide forthem. Teachers of public schools must make monthly reports 
of all required statistics, and a summary report of the whole term at its close, to the 
district clerk, or forfeit the last month’s wages. Uniformity of text books is secured 
by a meeting of the presidents of the boards of edueation of cities, towns, villages, 
and district directors, held every fifth year since January, 1875. Neither sectarian 
teaching in the public schools nor appropriation of State funds to private or sectarian 
schools is permitted. ‘ 
The State superintendent apportions the public school fund to the different counties 
according to school population and county officers apportion to the districts in the 
same way. Districts failing to return an enumeration of their school youth receive 
no portion of the public fund. 
    SCHOOL FINANCES. 
In addition to 25 per cent. of the State revenue, the public schools are sustained 
from the proceeds of lands granted by the United States; by moneys or other prop- 
erty belonging to any educational fund, except where vested rights would be infringed; 
by the net proceeds of the State tobacco warehouse; by sales of escheated lands or 
other property and of estrays; by unclaimed dividends of distributive shares of the 
estates of deceased persons; by fines, penalties, or forfeitures; by congressional grants; 
and by any grants, gifts, or devises made to the State, not otherwise appropriated by 
the terms of such grants. Local taxes may be levied for building school-houses or 
paying for them afterwards, but must not exceed two-fifths of 1 per cent. on the 
PeeRuts property in a district. For school purposes, except in cities and towns, dis- 
trict taxes are not to exceed 40 cents on $100, unless by a majority vote of taxpayers, 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
The following among other changes were made in the school Jaws in 1883: 
The school year was made to begin July 1, instead of the first Tuesday in April. 
It is required that the entire estimate for public schools shall not exceed 1 per cent.. 
on property in districts formed of cities, towns, and villages, nor 65 cents on $100 in 
other districts. School boards are forbidden to employ any of their own members as 
teachers. District clerks are forbidden to issue warrants in favor of teachers for the 
last month’s salary until they shall have filed with said clerk their term reports. 
The attendance at school of any child afflicted with any contagious or infectious dis- 
ease is forbidden. No member of any school board of city, town, or village havin; 
less than 20,000 inhabitants may hold any office or employment of profit from sai 
board while a member thereof, except that the secretary may receive not to exceed 
$100 and the treasurer $50 for any one year; and said boards are required to make 
semiannually a detailed report of school finances and publish the same in a local 
newspaper, if there be such; if not, by notices posted in public places. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
Any city, town, or village may organize as a school district and elect a board of 
6 directors for a term of 3 years, with a president, secretary, and treasurer, chosen 
from its Own members. It is the duty of such boards to establish primary and higher 
schools of grade similar to those in other districts and to look after the other edue 
cational interests of the district.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Hannibal made no report for 1883, but in 1884 for its school population of 4,115 had 
7 school buildings, valued, with other school property, at $58,700. The enrolment was 
52.49 per cent. of enumeration, the schools holding in average attendance 67.41 per 
cent. of the enrolment. Schools were in session 175 days. Nospecial teachers were em- 
ployed. The superintendent urges the opening of an evening school and an increase 
of school rooms to meet the increasing population. ' 
Kansas City in 1883 had 13 school buildings, with 7,384 sittings, valued, with other 
school property, at $359,400; in 1884 there were 15 school buildings, a gain of 2, with 
8,463 sifitings, a gain of 1,079; value of all school property, $461,000, a gain of $101,600. 
With an increase of 2,552 in school population and of 8% in enrolment, there were 
19 more teachers employed. The per cent. of average daily attendance to enrolment 
was 64 in both years, with a small fraction in favor of the latter. Schools were 
taught 177 days in 1883 and 176 in 1884. In 1883 there were 1,500 in private and 
parochial schools, and in 1884 2,000. 
St. Joseph reports for 1883~84 19 school buildings, with 3,690 sittings, all school 
property valued at $196,375. There was a decrease of 384 in school population, with 
an increase of 63 in enrolment, of 15 in average daily attendance, of 6 in teachers, and 
of $146 in expenditure. The schools were in session 198 days in 1883 and 188 in 1884. 
The estimated enrolment of 700 in private and parochial schools was the same in both 
years. The superintendent urges the establishment of a training school for those who 
are to teach in the schools of the city and also that teachers’ wages be restored to 
their former schedule. 
St. Louis reported in 1882~83 satisfactory progress made in all grades of the pub- 
lic schools, definite results having been realized more especially in the primary and 
intermediate grades, where the greater portion of the children are instructed in the 
rudiments of number, form, and language. Much attention had been given to 
methods of instruction, and the improvement in this direction had awakened new in- 
terest in the work among both teachers and pupils. | 
No report for 1883~’84 has been received. 
Sedalia in 1883 had 8 school buildings, with 1,860 sittings, for its school population 
of 3,650; all school property was valued at $70,000. The enrolment was about 72 per 
cent. of the school population, while 63.46 per cent. of those enrolled were in average 
daily attendance. Schools were in session 178 days. Estimated enrolment in private 
and parochial schools, 200. - 
KINDERGARTEN. 
There are 51 Kindergiirten reporting, all but one of them apparently in St. Louis. 
For their statistics, see Table V of the appendix, and for summaries of the same, the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. | 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES, 
. To be employed as a teacher in any public school in the State a person must hold 
a certificate of qualification signed by the commissioner of the county where the 
applicant intends to teach, those holding certificates from the State superintendent ex-
-P-A-G-E-437
MISSOURI. 165 
eepted. To obtain said certificate the applicant must furnish evidence of good moral 
character and of fitness to teach the ordinary common school branches. Certificates 
are good only for one year, unless the person is found qualified to teach the elements 
of the natural sciences and physiology. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
Missouri now supports 5 normal schools: One at the State University, Columbia, 
and 3 others at Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Cape Girardeau, called, first, second, 
and third district normal schools, besides Lincoln Institute, Jefferson City, for the 
training of colored teachers, the one at the State College, Rolla, apparently having 
been dropped. 
» The district normal schools are each under the control of boards of 7 regents, ap- 
pointed by the governor, with consent of the senate, for 6 years, with partial change 
every 2 years, the State superintendent being ex officio a member of each board. 
The 4 years of study in the normals and the grades of certificates given are sub- 
stantially the same in all. Certificates, good for 2 years, are given at the end of 2 
years’ study; certificates good for 3 years, at the end of another year of study; and 
a State certificate and diploma, with degree of bachelor of arts and didactics, to those 
taking the full 4-year course. All the normals have model schools. 
Kirksville (first district) in 1884 had 11 instructors, with 501 normal and 181 other 
students; graduated 17, of whom 16 engaged in teaching; received from the State 
$10,000 ; and had a library of 1,000 volumes, increased by 300 during the year. 
Warrensburg (second district) in 1882~83 had 11 instructors and 448 normal students, 
of whom it graduated 43, 18 from the 4-year, 6 from the 3-year, and 19 from the 2-year 
course, 
Cape Girardeau (third district) reported for 1884 8 instructors and 248 normal stu- 
dents, graduating 39, all of whom were engaged as teachers in the public schools. It 
received from the State $22,784, $12,784 for repairs, and has alibraty of 1,800 volumes, 
150 being pedagogical. 
The dean of the normal department of the State university, Columbia, in 1884 was 
assisted by 16 other instructors in the university ; 37 normal and 573 other students 
were in attendance and 11 were graduated from the 2-year course. The appropriations 
are in common with the other departments ofthe university. Graduates receive State 
certificates from the State superintendent, without further examination. 
Lincoln Institute (colored), Jefferson City, shows for 188384 a faculty of 8 instruc- 
tors, with 187 students, of whom 61 were in the normal department, and a graduating 
class of 5 from its 4-year course and 9 from its 2-year course. The preparatory course 
covers 5 years. Appropriations were $12,500 for maintenance, $2,000 for completing 
dormitory, $1,000 for repairs, and $500 for the purchase of books. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Liberal Normal School, at Liberal (1882), in its report for 1883~84, shows 2 in- 
structors and 5 normal and 108 other students. Graduates from its full course of 3 
years receive certificates good for the county in which the school is situated, without 
further examination. 
La Grange College, La Grange, continued in 1883~84 its normal department, in which 
instruction is given by the college professors in the general science of education and 
in the theory and practice of teaching. 
St. Louis Normal. School is maintained by the city for the training of young women 
to teach in the city public schools. In 1883~84 there were 6 instructors, 64 students, 
and 22 graduates from its 2-year full course, all engaged in teaching, their certificates 
being good for the city, without further examination. 
Normal courses were also reported at Southwest Baptist College, Bolivar; Lewis 
College, Glasgow; Stewartsville College, Stewartsville; Central Wesleyan College, 
Warrenton; and Christian University, Canton. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
In those counties where (by vote of the citizens) the superintendents give their 
whole time to the supervision of the public schools, receiving full pay therefor, as 
provided by law, it is their duty to hold normal institutes for teachers, subject to the 
advice of ie State superintendent; and teachers are required to become members of 
such institutes and to attend regularly. 
The State superintendent, in his report for 1883~84, recommends an amendment to the 
law which shall require the organization of institutes in every county. He considers 
them a necessity, as they supply teachers with that which is absolutely essential to 
them, and which only the few who can attend normal schools obtain otherwise than 
in these institutes. He thinks the efficiency of the average teacher is increased 20 per 
oe bi : month’s earnest labor at an institute, and that of inexperienced teachers 
oubled.

166 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
| | During the summer of 1884. many interesting and valuable institutes were held. 
While in a number of counties there were none, yet more were held for four weeke 
than ever before and with better results than formerly. Longer sessions were held, 
more experienced conductors were employed, there was a better attendance by the 
teachers, and the interest taken in the work by the public was greater than formerly.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Kansas City in 188283 reported a high school which enrolled 316, with an average 
daily attendance of 231 and a graduating class of 24. Its studies are arranged in 
general and classical courses of 4 years each. | 
St. Joseph in 1882-83 enrolled ‘in its high school 204, with an average daily at 
“tendance of 162, graduating 25 from its 4-year course. In 1884 there were 185 students 
attending, of whom 144 were in average attendance. The year is said to have been 
one of prosperity, marked by faithful and efficient work. 
St. Louis reported in 1882~83 an enrolment of 781 pupils in the high school, with 
592 in average attendance, of whom 76 were graduated, 
There is no information for 1883~84 at hand from any of the above or other high 
schools in the State, except that at St. Joseph. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, 
and preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appen- 
dix following. | 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. | 
UNIVERSITYES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. | 
The University of Missouri, Columbia, continued in 1883-84 to give instruction in 11 
academic schools, 6 in science and 5 in languages, and in 9 professional schools, 1 
of the latter (the School of Mines and Metallurgy) being at Rolla. There was a fac- 
ulty of 33 members, with 573 students, 71 being in the mining school at Rolla. Women 
are admitted on equal terms with men. 
The Washingion University, St. Louis, continues to give, in its Smith Academy, for 
young men, and the Mary Institute, for young women, thorough preparatory train- 
ing for the 3 collegiate courses in arts, philosophy, and science. Graduates of the 2 
former courses, of 4 years each, receive the degrees of A.B. and pH.B. There are also 
provided 3 degrees beyond the ordinary A. M.: the first, cum laude; the second, magna 
cum laude ; the third, summa cum laude. The Manual Training School, established 
in 1879, affords an exceedingly useful course in mechanical industries. The St. Louis 
School of Fine Arts, 2 department of the university, gives training in art. For an 
account of the Manual Training School, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, fur- 
theron. Free evening schools, preparatory to industrial pursuits, are held in the 
polytechnic building, also connected with the university. 
The Southwest Baptist College, Bolivar (organized 1879), appears now, for the first 
time, in the collegiate table, IX, of the appendix, having been previously in the aca- 
demic list. It shows classical, and Latin-scientific courses and a course in letters of 
4 years each, a normal course of 3 years, one in music of 4 years, and an undefined 
commercial course 
Westminster College, Fulton (Presbyterian), not reported in 1881 or 1882, now shows a 
classical course of 6 years and a scientific course of 4, with an English course de- 
signed to fit boys for business, | 
Morrisville College, Morrisville (Methodist Bpipeond chartered as a college in 1876, 
but heretofore found in the academic list, now, for the first time, appears in that of 
colleges. It shows a faculty of 5 members, with a preparatory department, which 
includes only ordinary English studies; a high school department, including higher 
English studies, with Latin optional; and a collegiate department, with the ordinary 
college studies, covering 4 years. | 
Sedalia University, Sedalia (Presbyterian), now first reported, shows a preparatory 
course of 3 years, and classical, scientific, and modern fncwanee courses of 4 year 
each, the first two leading to the degree of a. B. and the other to that of B. s. 
There are also commercial, normal, and music courses. Women are admitted on 
equal terms with men. From an academic character this institution has gradually 
advanced to an apparently fair college rank. 
Most of the above colleges report preparatory training of from 1 to 3 years. 
Christian and St. Louis Universities and Stewartsville College have commercial 
courses, St. Louis University and Pritchett School Institute each provided a graduate 
course, while music, drawing, and painting were taught in nearly all.

INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
All the colleges, except Central, William Jewell, and the 4 Roman Catholic insti- 
tutions, admit women on equal terms with men. 
For statistics of colleges for women only, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for 
summaries of the same, the report of the Conmmissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Missouri Agricultural and Mechanical College, a department of the University of 
Missouri, combines in its complete course the academic and professional. The latter 
may be taken first or alone, the purpose being to give a special rather than a general 
education. Students enter at once on the 2-year course in agriculture, and when it 
is completed may, if they desire, pursue the academic studies as graduates, with spe- 
cial advantages. The degree of bachelor of agricultural science is conferred on those 
who complete the course and pass a final examination, 
The School of Mines and Metallurgy, Rolla, also a department of the University of 
Missouri, has a proparatory course of 2 years, the satisfactory completion of which 
admits to the technical department without examination, and 2 technical courses of 
3 years each, leading to the degrees of mining and civil engineer. There is no men- 
tion in the catalogue of 1883-’84 of the teachers’ class heretofore reported. 
The O'Fallon Polytechnic Institute, at Washington University, covers the whole sci- 
entific work of the university, including such elementary instruction as circumstances 
may require. It continues to offer 5 courses of 4 years, 1 each in civil and in me- 
ehanical engineering, in chemistry, in inining and metallurgy, and in building and 
architecture. The same rule as to degrees of distinction applies to this department 
asto the colleges of the university. After June, 1885, only bachelor’s degrees will 
be conferred on the graduates from the 4-year courses. The full professional degrees 
are given only to graduate students who complete an additional course during a fifth 
ear. 
_ The Manual Training School in Washington University, presenting some novel feat- 
ures, proceeds on the assumption that there is too little manual training given in 
ordinary American schools. This school exacts close and thoughtful study of books 
as well as of tools. By lengthening the school day an hour ane abridging the daily 
recitations, time is found for drawing and tool work. No special trades are taught, 
the work being disciplinary, nor are articles manufactured for sale. The course of 
instruction covers 3 years, the school time being about equally divided between the 
mental and manual exercises. One hour a day is given to cote and 2 to shop 
work. Everything made by the pupils must first be drawn by them. One year is 
spent in wood work and 2 at iron and steel work, the boys in the third year making 
their own tools. The interest the pupils evince for the shop work is said to be great, 
but does not lessen that felt in their other studies, The examinations passed by the 
graduates of the schoo], when they are candidates for polytechnic schools or colleges, 
are said to be, on an average, fully equal to those passed by students having had other 
preparation. The graduates of this school enter various pursuits, and a number have 
made rapid progress in mechanic arts and occupy responsible positions. The school 
is no longer regarded as an experiment. Its 240 sittings are all occupied and numbers 
await future vacancies, The minimum age of admission is 14 years. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.—Theological studies are pursued to some extent in the Christian Univer- 
sity, Warrenton; in Central College, Fayette (Methodist Episcopal South); and in La 
Grange College (Baptist). Central Wesleyan College, Warrenton (German Method- 
ist), has a regular 4-year course of theological studies in German. St. Vincent’s Col- 
lege, Cape Girardeau (Roman Catholic), has a sheologiey department. Concordia 
College Seminary, St. Louis (Evangelical Lutheran), has a full 3-year theological 
course in German. 
The Jeremiah Vardeman School of Theology, in William Jewell College, Liberty 
(Methodist Episcopal), shows a regular course in theology of 2 years for those who 
can read the scriptures in Greek and Hebrew, and for those not having a classical 
education the course is so arranged as to be pursued, in connection with the literary 
studies, in a course of 5 years. 
Law.—The law school in the University of Missouri, Columbia, with a faculty of 
9, gave instruction in a 2-year course, an elective one being provided for those not 
desiring a full course. The mode of instruction is by daily examinations upon text: 
books, by lectures, and by exercises in a moot court held every Monday. Those who

sustain a satisfactory final examination receive the degree of bachelor of law, which 
entitles them, without further examination, to practise in the courts of the State. 
The St. Louis Law School, in the Washington University, continued its 2-year course. 
With a view to raising the standard of legal instruction, it purposes, as soon as cir- 
cumstances will allow, to add another year to its course. The present one is designed 
to prepare young men to a degree above the ordinary standard of admission to the 
bar in any part of the United States, with the conviction that an elevation of stand- 
ard is required in the interest of the profession at large. Moot courts are held weekly, 
ere. as nearly as possible the forms of an ordinary court. Adult students who 
ave been members of the senior class during the entire term with the prescribed reg- 
ularity and have passed a satisfactory final examination receive the degree of LL, B., 
: which entitles them to admission, without further examination, to the bars of both the 
State and United States courts. { 
Medicine.—The law of 1883 regulating the practice of medicine authorizes the State 
board of health to issue certificates to all who shall furnish satisfactory proof o: 
having received diplomas or licenses from legally chartered medical schools in good 
standing, of whatever school or system of medicine. They are to prepare two forms of 
certificates, one for those in possession of diplomas or licenses, the other for candi- 
dates examined by the board. j 
The following 9 ‘‘regular” medical schools reporting in 1883-84 have courses of from 
18 to 34 weeks: Missouri Medical College (St. Louis), Kansas City Medical College, 
Kansas City Hospital College of Medicine, and St. Louis College of Physicians and 
Surgeons have courses of 20 weeks; Northwestern Medical College of St. Joseph 
and St. Joseph Medical College, courses of 5 months; St. Louis Medical College, 
one of 21 weeks; medical department of the University of Kansas City, one of 26 
weeks; while the Medical School of the University of Missouri, Columbia, has a 2-— 
year course, the first year being 32 weeks in length, the other nearly 36 weeks, The 
Missouri Medical College, St. Louis College of Physicians and Surgeons, and St. Joseph. 
Medical College recommend, but do not require, a 3-year graded course; while the 
St. Louis Medical College has a 3-year graded course and the Medical School of the 
State University one of 2 years. : | 
The American Medical College, St. Louis (eclectic), has a course of 20 weeks, with 
8 professors and 1 adjunct professor. | 
The Homeopathic Medical College of Missouri, St. Louis, has a course of 19 
weeks, with a faculty of 12 professors. 
The requirements for admission are substantially the same in all but 2, which make 
no requirements, viz, a good English education and good moral character; for gradua- 
tion, 3 years of medical study, from 2 to 3 years’ attendance on full courses of lectures, — 
and a satisfactory final examination on all the branches taught. The aggregate 
number attending the regularschools in 188384 was 618, of whom 212 were graduated, — 
under 100 professors. In the eclectic school there were 9 instructors, 65 matriculates, 
and 15 graduates ; in the homeopathic school, 12 professors, 39 matriculates, and 19 
graduates. | 
Dentistry.—The Missouri Dental College, St. Louis, 1883-’84, requires for admis- 
sion agood English education; for graduation, attendance on 2 full courses of lectures, 
a thorough treatment of some patient requiring the usual dental operations, under 
the eye of the demonstrator, the construction of at least one practical artificial case, 
eng the passage of a satisfactory final examination in all the branches taught in the — 
college. 
The Kansas City Dental College in 1883~84 gave dental instruction in the usual 
courses of such schools, with the usual requirements for admission and graduation. 
Pharmacy.—The St. Louis College of Pharmacy gives instruction in chemistry, 
materia medica, botany, and pharmacy. The requirements are: For admission to the — 
junior class, an examination held in accordance with the rules of the State boards; 
for graduation, attendance on 2 courses of lectures and service in the drug business | 
4 years. The new building just erected affords superior facilities for teaching. 
Women are admitted on the same conditions as men. 
For statistics of professional schools, see Tables XI, XII, and XIII of the appendix, 
and for summaries of same, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner 
i preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
  EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. | 
The Missouri Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Fulton, in 1882-83 
enrolled 199 pupils, representing 84 counties and the city of St. Louis, making 836 — 
since its organization. The course of study is the same as that of the common schools. 
The boys receive instruction in three trades— cabinet work, shoemaking, and print- — 
ing — furnishing the institution with all needed in these lines of industry. The girls 
are taught to make and repair clothes And are also instructed in genet sewing 
and housework. Tuition and board are free to all residents in the State, the State

appropriation for the 2 years 1883 and 1884 being $118,500. The property of the 
institution is valued at $172,000. 
The Missouri School for the Blind, St. Louis, in 1882~83 enrolled 102 inmates; 13 
completed the course in all departments and were awarded the usual certificate of 
distinction ; quite a number over the age of 25, admitted to learn a trade, completed 
the course in the mechanical department and were discharged. 
In the primary and intermediate departments the studies are those of the common 
schools ; in the literary department the course embraces the studies usually taught in 
the high schools. Thorough musical training is given to those possessing musical 
talent. Broom and brush making, cane seating, and rag carpet weaving are the 
soroa taught. Property is valued at $200,000; the annual State appropriation is 
57,000. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Girls’ Industrial Home and School, St. Louis, in its twenty-ninth annual report, 
shows a family of from 55 to 70 children, from 1 year old to 16. Very few of the lat- 
ter remain in the institution, as good homes are readily found for them, where they 
generally become useful and happy. Dressmaking and other branches of woman’s 
work are taught. Kindergarten songs are taught in the school. The home is sus- 
tained by private charities. 
HOMES FOR ORPHAN OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
For statistics of these schools, see Table XXII of the appendix ; for summaries of 
them, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Missouri State Teachers’ Association held its twenty-third annual session at 
Sweet Springs, June 24-27, 1884, State Superintendent Coleman presiding. 
Mr. Loos, of New London, gave an address on ‘Memory in the school.” Mr. Coats 
followed with a paper on “ Physical education,” in the discussion of which the neg- 
lect of teachers in regard to this was pointed out. Ex-Superintendent Shannon read 
apaper on “Free thought and free thinkers,” in which che said that of all men the 
teacher should be the freest to think, and his thoughts, written on the hearts of his 
pupils, should eunoble, elevate, and dignify human life. Prof. Anthony Haynes then 
read a ‘‘ Defence of the normal school system;” Commissioner T. P. Lee, a paper on 
“ Mental and written arithmetic ;” followed by a talk on “ Practicalteaching in primary 
schools,” introduced by Commissioner Lumpkins. A Giscussion then took place on ‘‘ The 
county commissioner a counsellor,” a paper on ‘County institutes” was read, and an ad- 
dress was given on ‘‘Institutes.” Then came a paper on “ Mental growth,” and an ad- 
dress by James H. Canfield, of Kansas University, on “The best education for the indus- 
trial classes,” said to have been the most effective exercise of the session. Papers fol- 
lowed on a variety of subjects, including “ The beautiful in education,” “School mas- 
ters and school teachers,” ‘‘ The new vs. the old,” and ‘‘ English in the high schools.” 
In the resolutions adopted, private schools in the State were recognized as valuable 
aids in the work of education and normal schools as an essential factor in the public 
school system. The improving condition of public education and public sentiment 
was noted with reference to the State school system, as seen in the better methods 
adopted, better teachers crip layed and more thorough teaching done in a large num- 
ber of country schools; in the introduction of a graded school system in many vil- 
lages and towns, and in the improvement of those already graded; in the more sightly 
and commodious school-houses erected ; in the increasing number of normal insti- 
tutes and of teachers Benes them ; and in the friendly attitude of the legislature. 
A resolution was also adopted looking to the establishment of a summer normal 
school of 4 weeks at the close of each annual convention, and arrangements were made 
to secure its beginning in connection with the next meeting at Sweet Springs, July, 
1885,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
é Bs] | 
As may be seen from the preceding summary, the increase in pupils enrolled dering 
1853-84 and in average daily attendance bears, for a young State, a fair proportion 
to the 24,000 more youth of legal school age (5-21), the per cent. of this age enrolled 
reaching nearly 66 and that in average attendance nearly 39. Many more school dis- 
tricts were reported, and very many more in which schools were sustained six months ; 
309 school-houses built indicates a considerable enlargement of accommodations ; 
while the valuation of school property increased, as did the number of teachers em- 
ployed, their average pay, the amount expended for public schools, and the amount 
of school funds, permanent and temporary, The fundshave kept pace withthe growth 
of the State, having increased so greatly as to allow in 1883-’84 an apportionment of 
23 per cent. more to each pupil than could be made five years previous. _ | 
Better preparation of teachers has resulted from a law of 1883 requiring them to 
attend county institutes, on penalty of having their certificates revoked. Much good 
has resulted from the adoption of a course of study in country schools as far as this 
has been tried, and the superintendent has taken measures to continue and increase

efforts in this direction. Greater public interest in school work was aroused by 
meetings of county associations, of which 31 were held during the year. This inter- 
est was stimulated by the newspaper press, which was largely instrumental in awaken- 
ing popular pride in the high standing of the State in respect to illiteracy, as shown 
by the United States Census of 1880. This placed Nebraska and Iowa in advance of 
all the other States in respect to the small proportion of persons unable to read, and 
gave Nebraska the lead when those unable to wrjte were counted. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
A State superintendent of pane instruction, elected by the people for 2 years, 
has general charge of the public schools, while a board of regents of the State uni- 
versity and a normal school board have control of the interests indicated by their 
titles. There is also a board, composed of various State officers, for the management 
of school lands and funds. 
Local school officers are county superintendents of public schools, elected by the 
people for 2 years, and district boards of 3 trustees, elected for 3 years. Districts 
having more than 150 youth of school age may, if a majority of the voters so decide, 
elect boards of 6 trustees. Women 21 years of age, residents of the district and 
owners of property or having children to educate, may vote in district meetings. 
The public schools of any district are free to all residents in it 5-21 years of age, 
and they must be taught at least 9 months of each year in districts having more than 
200 pupils, 6 months in those having 75 to 200, and 3 months in those with less than 
75. The State funds are apportioned by the State superintendent to the counties in 
proportion to school population, and by county superintendents to districts, three- 
fourths of the amount in proportion to the school population therein, the remaining 
one-fourth equally to the districts. Each district director reports annually to the 
county superintendent, the latter to the State superintendent, and he to the governor. 
The system of education includes public high schools, teachers’ institutes, a State 
normal school, a State university, and a reformatory for children. Instruction in all 
schools supported or aided by public funds must be non-sectarian. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The funds for the support of the public schools are derived from the income of a 
State common school fund; from such percentage as has been or may be granted by 
Congress on the sale of lands in the State; from moneys arising from the sale or lease 
of school lands; from the proceeds or all Jands granted to-the State, unless for other 
purpose distinctly stated ; and from the proceeds of escheats and forfeitures. Inaddi- 
tion to the income of this fund, there is for public schools a State school tax of not 
more than 1} mills on $1 of taxable property. Taxes are also voted by districts, 
which may not exceed 25 mills on $1. The income of the public schools is also aug- 
mented by various fines, licenses, &c. 
  SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
Public schools in incorporated cities with 2,000 or more inhabitants are under the 
direction of boards of education of 6 members, elected on a general ticket for terms of 
2 years, one-third of them liable to annual change. These boards elect annually a 
superintendent of public instruction, who becomes the principal teacher.

  172 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICLULARS. {fora 
Lincoln in 1883-84 had 1,520 pupils enrolled in primary schools, 704 in intermediate, 
196 in grammar, and 87 in high; there were%6 colored pupils. The schools were taught 
9 months, in 8 buildings, containing 38 rooms. Average salary of teachers, $51. 
Omaha in 1882~83 had an increased enrolment of 711, more than 15 per cent. over 
that of the preceding year, and an average attendance greater by 689, or more than 
23 per cent. This increase in daily attendance severely taxed the resources of the 
board of education in providing room. Although 3 new school buildings were erected 
during the year, giving 8 more rooms, while others were in progress, these came far 
short of meeting the demand. 
Among the features of 1883-84 were the introduction of music into the course of 
study, the employment of special teachers in this branch and in drawing and pen- 
manship, and the completion of 3 more school buildings, giving 18 more rooms, 
another building being improved and still another in process of erection. The schools 
maintained their high standard in studies, discipline, and attendance, with a large 
falling off in cases of tardiness. Evening schools had 260 pupils, with an average at- 
tendance of 40, under 3 teachers. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 1,729. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
No person in this State may teach in the public schools without a certificate, based 
on examination, from the State superintendent of public instruction, from the county 
superintendent of the county in which he purposes to teach, from the State Normal 
School, or from a city board of examiners. A diploma from the State Normal School 
or from a like normal school of another State has the force of a high grade certificate ; 
the latter, however, must be approved by the State superintendent. For a profes- 
sional State certificate, which authorizes the holder to teach in any public school of 
the State without further examination, there must be evidence of high character and 
of broad scholarship or of graduation from a college or university in good standing 
and of successful teaching for at least 3 years in a highschool of the State. — 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. | 
The State Normal School, Peru, gives 2 years to elementary studies and 3 to a 
higher course. Vocal music, penmanship, and orthography constitute a part of the 
daily exercises and instruction in Latin is given in the advanced course. Graduates 
from the elementary course are qualified to teach in common ungraded and lower 
grade schools; those from the higher, for any educational position in the public schools 
of the State. | 
The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, in its department of didactics, presents elective 
studies in the junior and senior years. The studies offered are history of education, 
State and national systems of education, school organization and management, and 
school supervision in city, village, and country. ee | 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
ctu 
The Santee Normal Training School, Santee Agency, established by the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to train Dakota Indian a teach- 
ers, and interpreters and to educate the men and women of the Dakota Nation, offers 
instruction in the English studies and science; also, in industrial work. Whole num- 
ber of students, 114; under normal training, 4. | 
Doane College presents a 3-year course of normal training in common English ard 
advanced studies. Special attention is given to the best methods of acquiring aud 
imparting knowledge, to school organization and discipline, and to State laws con- 
cerning education. Opportunity for practice teaching is given to students. __ 
Nebraska Wesleyan University, in a 3-year teachers’ course, trains students in all the 
branches required for a first grade certificate. |

dix to this volume; for a summary of those statistics, a corresponding table in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. | 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 1 
School Work and Literary Notes, a semimonthly published at Crete, continued to 
be in 1883 and 1884 the official organ of public instruction and the chief medium for 
the diffusion of educational information throughout the State. It was in its eleyenth 
volume as School Work in 1884, (

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Any district containing 150 or more children between the ages of 5 and 21 years 
may elect a district board of 6 trustees, which may grade and classify the scholars in 
the district, establish a high school when ordered by the district, and prescribe courses 
of study and text books for the same. In 1883~’84 there appear 37 such schools, with 
a total of 1,955 pupils, an increase of 141 from 1882~83, 
' The State report says that a joint committee of the faculty of the university and of 
the principals and superintendents of public schools arranged in 1884 two courses for 
the high schools, a minor and a major. Completing the former — which includes arith- 
metic, elementary algebra, scientific studies, and English, Latin, and German ele- 
ments—admits to thesecond year of the University Latin School. The completion ofthe 
latter — which includes higher elements of the same kind, with Greek and considerable 
English history — admits to the freshman class of the university. High schools adopt- 
ing these courses and signifying their desire to prepare students for the university 
will be visited by a committee from the university, and, on approval of their work, 
will be allowed to enter their graduates without examintion. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, has a college of literature, science, and the arts; 
a college of medicine, organized in 1883 ; anindustrial college, embracing agriculture, 
practical science, civil engineering, and the mechanical arts; and a conservatory of 
music. The college of literature, science, and the arts presents classical, scientific, 
and literary courses, each covering 4 years and leading to appropriate degrees. Two 
years are given to preparatory studies. Drawing, painting, ancient and modern lan- 
guages, and didactics form a part of the course, the last optional. 
During 1883 and 1884 the faculty of the university wag greatly strengthened, stu- 
dents increased in number and improved in quality, and more baccalaureate degrees 
were given than half the entire number for the preceding 10 years, or the whole pre- 
vious existence of the university. During 188384 there was an attendance of 349 
students in all departments. 
The other collegiate institutions reporting are Doane College, Crete; Nebraska Col- 
lege, Nebraska City ; Creighton College, Omaha; and Nebraska Wesleyan University, 
Fullerton. All include preparatory departments or courses and classical courses of 4 
years and all but Creighton College scientific courses. 
Doane College reports the erection during the year of an astronomical observatory, 
the first and only one in the State. Its establishment is due to the liberality of the 
late Charles Boswell, of West Hartford, Conn., who recently gave the college $4,500, 
this making a total of $13,000 received from him at various times, besides an addi- 
tional amount left by will. The observatory is also a signal service station, codper- 
ating with the United States Signal Service at Washington. The equipment includes 
an equatorial telescope of 8-inch aperture, a transit instrument, an astronomical clock, 
a sidereal break circuit chronometer, a time ball dropped daily at noon by electrical 
connection with the observatory clock, and various other electrical devices. This col- 
lege alsoreceived during the year a bequestfrom Mr. L. J. Knowles, of Worcester, Mass., 
cash from Mr. and Mrs. Knowles amounting to $1,000, and additional amounts from 
others, making a total of $11,400. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Provision for scientific instruction is found in the Industrial College of the University 
of Nebraska, and to some extent in the general scientific courses of that university, Ne- 
braska Wesleyan University, and Doane and Nebraska Colleges. The leading studies of 
the Industrial College are agriculture, horticulture, civil engineering, and related sub- 
jects. In the agricultural course prominence is given to the sciences in proportion to 
the directness of their relation to farming, and an effort is made to give the student 
(who has two or more agricultural or horticultural studies each year) such knowledge 
and skill as will be of the greatest value to him should he leave before completing a 
full course, 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological training has been heretofore Teported in the Nebraska Divinity School, 
Nebraska City (Protestant Episcopal), in the German Theological Seminary, Crete 
(Congregational), and in the Nebraska Baptist Seminary, Gibbon. Thereisno report 
for 1883-84 from the Baptist Seminary; the Nebraska Divinity School appears to 
have had only 2 students, under 1 professor ; and the German Seminary had 15, under2

professors. The Santee Normal Training School of the American Misauacy Associa- 
tion, meant to prepare teachers and preachers for the Dakota Indians, reports 39 
students of theology in 1883, under 4 instructors. 
No schools of law report from this State, but the department of political science and 
philgepphy of the State university includes in its curriculum courses in international 
aw and in the Constitution of the United States. 
Medical instruction continues to be given at Omaha Medical College, Omaha. in the 
usual course of 3 years’ study, including 2 terms of lectures. These extend over 
26 weeks. An examination in English branches is required for admission, and both 
sexes are received on equal terms. A college of medicine after the “regular” form 
was established by the board of regents, in connection with the State university, in 
February, 1883, and a faculty of 7 elected, who agreed to serve the university for two 
years without compensation, except necessary travelling expenses. Ata later meeting 
of the board, in June, 1883, representation in the college was also granted to the 
homeopathic and eclectic schools of practice upon the same conditions. In June, 1884, 
regulations were adopted requiring attendance on 3 lecture terms of not less than 6 
months each, as well as a satisfactory examination on all the studies of the course. 
As a result, most of the students entering in 1884 did so for a 3-year course. After 
September, 1885, candidates for admission must sustain an examination on the subjects 
required for a county superintendent’s certificate of the second grade, with the ad- 
dition of elementary chemistry, and must also show ability to write the English lan- 
guage correctly. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION, 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, Omaha, instructs, by both the sign 
and what is termed the aural methods, deaf residents of the State 7 to 25 years of age. 
This instruction is in common school branches, history, physiology, philosophy, &c. 
and the report for 1883 and 1884 says that there were 27 pupils under aural and oral 
instruction. There is practice also in carpentry and printing for the boys, with se 
ing and general housework for girls. Wood engraving was added in 1884. The in- 
stitution publishes an interesting Mute Journal, which was in its eleventh volume 
in that year. Since the organization of the school, in 1869, it is said that 211 pupils 
have received instruction, of whom 14i were in attendance in 1883-84. For other 
statistics, see Table XVIII of the appendix. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Nebraska Institute for the Blind, Nebraska City, furnishes tuition to resident 
blind pupils 9 to 21 years of age in common and higher school branches, with special 
attention to vocal and instrumental music. All receive instruction in some indus- 
trial work or trade which will fit them for self support. 
Thirty-six pupils were under instruction in the biennial term which leniaetl in 1884, 
and in 1885 the first class was expected to graduate from a literary department reorgan- 
ized in the two preceding years. | 
STATE REFORM SCHOOL. 
The State Reform School, Kearney, organized in 1881, reports for 1883 a total of 62 
inmates, 27 of them committed during the year. Age for admission, 7-16; instruc- 
tors, 10; studies, the common English branches and drawing. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
NEBRASKA STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The Nebraska State Teachers’ Association held its annual convention at Lincoln, 
March 25, 1884, Hon. W. W. W. Jones, State superintendent, presiding. Among the 
papers read and discussed were ‘ Educational hindrances,” ‘National aid to educa- 
tion,” “Twenty years in school,” ‘The relation of the teacher to the people,” ‘‘ Modern 
languages,” ‘Special training for teachers,” and ‘‘ The relation of secondary and 
superior instruction in the State;” also, an address on the relation of high schools to 
the State university, discussing fully the question of codperation between these in- 
stitutions, which seems to have been secured, as may be seen under Secondary In- 
» struction, preceding. |

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The falling off in mining in this State begins to show itself in a diminishing popula- 
tion, and the statistics of public schools may be expected to sympathize with the 
downward movement. Nevertheless, the per cent. of school youth enrolled shows in 
188384 an increase of about 2 per cent. and that in average daily attendance an 
increase of 4.43. With 3 new school districts formed, there were 9 more that reported 
school statistics; of 7 additional public schools, 5 were graded ; more men were em~- 
ployed in teaching, higher pay was given to both sexes thus employed, and expendi- 
ture for public schools increased, although not largely. 
The State superintendent says that there has been an increasing interest in the 
prosperity of the public schools, partly from discussion of school questions in 3 State 
teachers’ institutes, partly from agitation of like questions in the public press, and 
partly from a nnanimous appeal by teachers for needed school reforms. County su- 
perintendents’ reports presented by him show a like increase of interest in many 
counties. The causes of failure, where failures to advance are spoken of, appear to be 
inadequacy of provision by the legislature for good schools, and especially inadequate 
taxation for them.
-P-A-G-E-448
176 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
} 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The general supervision of public school interests is in the hands of a State super- 
intendent of public instruction, chosen by the people for 4 years, and a State board of 
education, consisting of the governor, the surveyor general, and the State superin- 
tendent, the last named being secretary of the board. County school affairs are admin- 
istered by county superintendents, elected by the people for 2 years. District schools 
are supervised by boards of trustees elected by the people and consisting of 3 or 5 
members, according to population. 
Kindergarten, primary, grammar, and high school departments must be established 
in connection with the public school system, provided the funds be sufficient for all; if 
not, preference is given to the lower grades, with the exception of the Kindergarten, 
which may not take precedence of any other department. Provision is also made by law 
for teachers’ institutes, a State university, and for the instruction of deaf and blind 
pupils of the State at Berkeley, Cal. Public schools are free to all youth 6 to18 years 
of age, and those 8 to 14 years of age are required to be sent to school at least 16 
weeks each year, unless excused by the school officers. One school must be taught in 
each district at least 3 months each year to entitle the district to a share in the public 
funds; but further provision is made for terms of at least 6 months, and it is the duty 
of trustees to see that funds are provided to sustain them for that length of time if 
possible. Schools must be entirely free from sectarian and denominational influences. 
Teachers are not entitled to pay from public funds unless they hold certificates of 
competency from State or county boards of examination and have made reports to 
their county superintendent and to the board of school trustees. County superin- 
tendents must report annually to the State superintendent, who reports biennially 
to the governor. 
FINANCES. 
Public schools are supported from the interest on a State school fund (which is ap- 
portioned to each county according to the number of youth 6 to 18 therein), a State 
school tax of-half a mill on the dollar of taxable property, and a county tax of from 
15 to 50 cents on the $100. When these funds are not sufficient to keep schools open 
at least 6 months of the year, trustees must Jevy a district tax sufficient to make up 
the deficiency. The schools may be taught for a longer term by additional taxes, 
if the voters of the district so decide, or by rate bills levied by the trustees on persons 
sending children to school. State and county school funds are apportioned by county 
superintendents to the several districts: 26 per cent. of them in proportion to the 
number of teachers employed, one teacher being assigned for each 100 census chil- 
dren or fraction thereof ; the remaining funds, according to the number of youth 6 to 18 
years of age. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Each village, town, or incorporated city constitutes but one school district, the 
schools therein being under the control of a board of trustees elected by the people, 
which board numbers 5 members in a city whose population reaches 1,500 or more 
registered voters. In smaller towns and cities, as in country districts, the boards 
comprise only 3 members. 
SCHOOLS OF VIRGINIA CITY. 
Virginia City, with a population in 1880 of 10,917, reported for 1882~R3, the latest 
information received, 1,848 youth 6 to 18 years of age, 1,787 of them enrolled in pub- 
lic schools and 994 in average attendance. The schools were taught 10 months, or 
200 days. Teachers were paid $90.60 a month; there were 25 employed ; 9 had taught 
the same school 2 years or more and all had attended teachers’ institutes. The valua- 
tion of school-houses and furniture was $32,000 ; of school apparatus, $300 ; of library, 
$250. There were also 156 children reported as attending private schools, 52 of them 
between 8 and 14 years of age. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES, 
Certificates are granted by the county board of examination in each county to per- 
sons who have passed a satisfactory examination in the branches of study taught in 
the public schools and who give evidence of good moral character and fitness to teach. 
Such certificates are of two grades, the first good for 2 years, the second for 1 year. 
‘Those of teachers who are successfully and continuously engaged in teaching in the 
county may be renewed without reéxamination. Certificates are also granted by the 
board, without examination, to holders of a life certificate of any State or of a Cali- 
fornia State Normal School diploma, provided that such State certificates or diplomas 
shall be presented within 5 years from the date of issue,
-P-A-G-E-449
NEVADA. : 177 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The only provision made by the State for the training of teachers appears to be in 
its State and county institutes. The superintendent is required by law to hold a 
State teachers’ institute annually, the sessions to last from 5 to 10 days, the expenses, 
not to exceed $100, to be paid out of the general fund. County superintendents are 
anthorized to convene one or more institutes annually, provided the county commis- 
sioners concur. The expenses, which must not exceed $100 in each year, are to be 
paid out of general county funds. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
As already stated, the school law authorizes the establishment of high school de- 
partments in connection with the public schools whenever the funds are sufficient to 
sustain them. Five such appear in 1882~83 and the same number in 1883~84. The 
superintendent of Storey County reports 2 in that county, but gives no statistics 
- regarding them. ft 
SUPERIOR, SCIENTIFIC, AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
STATE UNIVERSITY. 
The legislature of 1883 appropriated $11,950 for the support of the various officers 
and for supplies of the institution at Elko. The regents have been endeavoring to 
attract outside scholars to it, desiring to make it what it is intended to be—a State 
university. Thus far it is said to have been little more than an Elko high school, 
supported by the State, nearly all the pupils being Elko children. 
SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. 
Bishop Whittaker’s School for Girls, Reno, while not claiming collegiate rank nor 
conferring degrees, presents a 4-year course of superior instruction in English branches, 
with Latin and the modern languages as optional studies. Careful attention is given 
to moral, mental, and physical training. Calisthenic exercises and recreation in the 
open air form an essential part of the daily discipline. 
No institutions for instruction in science, theology, law, or medicine report from 
this State. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
Provision is made by the State for the instruction of its deaf and dumb youth at 
the institution in Berkeley, Cal., $300 each being paid for board and tuition and about 
$50 more for clothing. Three Nevada pupils were under instruction here in 1884, of 
whom 2 were deaf and dumb, the other blind. 
TRAINING OF ORPHANS, 
The State Orphans’ Home, Carson City, affords instruction in the elementary Eng- 
lish branches and vocal music, as well as in the principles of morality and religion. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE INSTITUTES. 
The fourth annual session of the State Teachers’ Institute was held December 27-29, 
1883, at Reno. It was largely attended both by teachers and school patrons, and 
unusual interest was manifested in the topics presented. The Reno papers gave a full 
account of the proceedings, and 1,500 copies of a paper containing them were distrib- 
ated among the school officers and teachers of the State. It was unanimously re- 
solved by the institute that amendments to the school laws were needed and that 
these should include provision for State certificates, for increasing the school rev- 
enue, and for aiding State institutes. 
In 1884 the institute was divided, the eastern division meeting at Elko, the west- 
ern at Gold Hill. The proceedings related mainly to the means of improving the 
school laws and securing greater efficiency in the execution of them,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The figures of the statistical summary just given tell their own tale of mingled loss 
and gain in schools, school districts, teachers, &c. The items of gain and loss, as may 
be seen, are about equal in number for the second of the two years covered by the re- 
port, _ In the earlier of these two years there had been gains in enrolment and aver-
-P-A-G-E-451

age attendance in the public schools, inthe number attending private or church schools, 
and in the valuation of State school property; the number of youth of school age not 
in school, too, was smaller by 601. But in the second year most of these gains diminish 
or altogether disappear. Thongh there were 5 more graded schools and 12 more school- 
houses, public schools were fewer by 15, and, while the number of teachers from 
normal schools increased, the increase was not suflicient to bring up the whole num- 
ber of such teachers to what it had been in 1881~82. Expenditure for public schools 
is the one thing that seems to be continuously rising. 
But whatever the general educational condition of the State as compared with it- 
self in other years, it stands, as compared with other States, among the highest, if 
not the very highest, as respects the proportion of school youth brought under in- 
struction in its schools. Taking, as in the statistical summary preceding, the United 
States census figures of 1880 for school youth, we find that the per cent. of pupils en- 
rolled in public schools alone, not counting those in private and church schools, was 
106.49 in 1882~83 and 106.17 in 1883~84, while the per cent. of average attendance 
was 75.65 and 71.80, Even with the limited school age of 5-15, such percentages of 
enrojment and attendance are highly creditable. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For the State there are a superintendent of public instruction, a board of commission- 
ers of the literary fund, and a board of trustees of the State Normal School; for towns, 
school committees, and a superintendent of schools in any town which may s0 elect ; 
for districts, a moderator, a clerk, and a prudential committee. Districts comprising 
the whole town iust elect a board of education. Such other districts as have 50 chil- 
dren of school age or support a public school 30 weeks each year or a graded school 
24 weeks may do the same. 
omen may vote in school meetings and are eligible to town and district school 
offices. 
The public schools are free to all resident children of school age, and children 8-14 
years of age are required to attend a public or private school or receive instruction 
at home at least 12 weeks in every year, six of which, in the case of a public school pu- 
pil, must be consecutive. No child under 16 years of age may be employed in any 
manufacturing establishment unless he has attended school 12 weeks of the preced- 
ing year; none under 14, unless he has attended 6 months, or the full term of the 
school taught in his district the preceding year; none under 12, who has not attended 
during the whole term; none under 16, unless in vacation, who cannot read and writd; 
and none under 10 may be so employed at all. : 
The owner or agent of a manufactory employing a child under 16 years of age and 
uncertified by the school committee as eligible to be employed becomes liable to a 
fine not exceeding $20 for each offence. Parents or guardians of children 8-14 vio- 
lating this law forfeit $10 for the first and $20 for every subsequent offence, ~ 
Towns may make bylaws concerning habitual truants and children 6-16 years of 
age not attending school and require their attendance, under a penalty of $10 for 
each offence or a sentence of one year in the. State Reform School. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The public sghools are sustained mainly from a town tax on polls and ratable 
estates, from a literary fund arising from a tax on the capital stock of banking corpo- rations and on savings bank dposits, and from a fund derived from the sale oe public 
lands. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS, 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Towns and cities have school committees or boards of education for the control of public schools and may appoint a superintendent.

j j a Estimated. 
In 1883~84 there were 54 different public schools, 39 of them graded, and 243 pupils 
in higher branches. Instruction is given in music, drawing, and penmanship. The 
schools were taught 32 weeks during the year, in 30 buildings. Valuation of school 
property, $184,402. Average monthly salary of men teaching, $88.48; of women, $42.14. 
Dover shows a small decrease in the enrolment and attendance of 1882~’83 ; in 1883-84, 
a corresponding increase. During the latter period the number between 5 and 15 
not attending school was reduced from 361 to 112. The high school was taught 38 
weeks; grammar schools, 36; primary and ungraded, 35; and an evening school, 17 
weeks. There were 39 day teachers, 3.evening, and 1 special teacher of music, In 
employing teachers no allowance is made for successful experience or for professional 
training, and the superintendent says that a een in this respect would decidedly 
raise the standard of education in the schools. Of 42 public schools in the city 33 
were graded. The 18 school-houses were in good condition and were valued, with 
other school property, at $116,000. | 
Manchester for 1832~83, with a large estimated increase of school children, shows a 
small decrease in enro]ment, but 119 more in average attendance. The city system 
includes primary, intermediate, grammar, high, training, and evening schools, with 
accommodations for 3,750 pupils. The schools were taught 180 days by 9 men and 76 
women, including 1 special teacher of music. Valuation of school property, $316,575. 
Estimated enrolment in private and church schools, 3,000. 
In 188384 an increase was noted in enrolment and attendance, with a decrease in 
the school expenditures. The average monthly salary of 8 men teaching was $130 
and of 78 women $40. There were 79 public schools, 65 of which were graded, the © 
average length of term being 36 weeks. Of the 25 school-houses all were in good con- 
dition and 1 was built during the year, at a cost of $12,512. Valuation of school 
property, $326,525. 
Nashua in 1882~83 had 17 school buildings, with 2,465 sittings for study, valued at 
$232,395. The city system included primary, intermediate, grammar, high, and even- 
ing schools, the last enrolling 542, with an average attendance of 329. Estimated 
eneeent in private schools, 20. 
The enrolment in public schools increased in 1883~84, but (apparently from an out- 
break of fever) average daily attendance decreased, The youth of school age not 
attending any school increased from 100 to 300. There were 3 men and 53 women 
teaching. ‘The average monthly salary of the former was increased during the year 
from $118 to $146.15; that of the latter from $30 to $45.21. Public school property 
was rim at $232,395. ries in 1882-83 reported the result of the year’s work as fairly satisfactory. 
Portsmouth in 1883 reported a small decrease in its public school enrolment and 
average daily attendance. The schools were classed as primary, grammar, and high 
and occupied 34 rooms. A special teacher of penmanship was employed. 
In 1884 there were 32 different public schools, 28 of which were graded, the average 
length of term for all being 40 weeks. The schools were taught in 14 buildings, val- 
ued, with other school property, at $83,000, an estimated decrease of $400. Average 
monthly salary of the 5 men teaching, $125; of the 34 women, $38. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
Persons desiring to be employed as teachers must present to the prudential com- 
mittee a certificate of qualification from the school committee of the town in which 
the school is to be taught. This certificate must give evidence of the good moral 
character and suitable temper of the teacher and of the capacity to teach at leastall 
common English branches, while for higher branches evidence must be given of ability 
to teach them also.

STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The New Hampshire State Normal School, Plymouth, admits young women of 16 
and young men of 17 years of age wha declare their intention to fit themselves for 
teaching. Candidates may offer themselves for examination in any branch taught 
in the normal school, and if found proficient are excused from further study of that 
branch except in the methods class. In this way the course may be completed in 3 
terms of 20 weeks each, instead of the customary 4 terms. The common English and 
higher branches are taught, including algebra, physics, physiology, mineralogy, and 
the elements of mental science. Instruction is given in vocal music and in designing ; 
also, in free hand, model, and geometrical drawing. The training school includes 100 
pupils from Plymouth village, is carefully graded, and is assigned to the pupil teachers 
in groups of 10. Certificates are given to graduates from the 1-year course and full 
diplomas to those who complete the 2-year course, but neither certificate nor diplo- 
ma entitles the holder to teach in the public schools of the State without further 
examination. For statistics, see Table III of the appendix. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
A training school at Manchester was organized in 1883-84 as a part of the city 
school system. Four schools, embracing both primary and middle grades, are used 
for schools of practice. The pupil teachers receive regular instruction from the prin- 
cipal in methods of teaching, school economy, the philosophy of education, &c. ‘The 
course of training covers 2 years. During thesecond term the pupil teachers receive 
a monthly salary of $10 and for the second year $20, often acting as substitute teach- 
ers in the place of regular teachers, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
According to a law of 1883, at least one teachers’ institute is to be held annually in 
each county, under the management of the State superintendent assisted by the princi- 
pal and teachers of the State Normal School, the expenses to be paid from the proceeds 
of the sale of State lands. An institute was accordingly held during 1883~84 in each 
county, at a total cost of $1,398, the whole number attending being 719. The sacri- 
fices made by the teachers to secure the advantages of these institutes, their eagerness 
to learn, and the large number of them attending, as well as the interest manifested 
by the public in the exercises, were all a source of unexpected encouragement to those 
in charge. It was the aim throughout to bring clearly before teachers the correct 
principles of pedagogic science, and to develop these, with actual teaching of the 
public school studies, in a natural and systematic order. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
No journal of this class is published in the State, but educational information.is 
given in the Journal of Education, Boston, which has aNew Hampshire department. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Any town, if a majority of the voters so agree, and any school district having at least 
100 children may, by vote of two-thirds of the qualified voters, establish a high school. 
Such town or district may appropriate that part of the school money to which it is 
entitled for the support of the high school, and may elect a high school committee, 
that shall have entire charge of it. There were 42 high schools reported in the State 
in 1883, with a total enrolment of 1,429 male students and 1,806 female, all under 108 
teachers. Number studying ancient languages, 1,089; modern languages, 417. The 
shortest term of high school in the State was 10 weeks, the longest 41 weeks, the for- 
mer at Dublin, the latter at Portsmouth. 
In 1884 the same number of schools enrolled 1,349 male and 1,749 female students, 
under 108 teachers. Number studying ancient languages, 983; modern languages, 
414, Volumes in libraries, 5,847. Length of term, about the same as the previous year 
for the same places. ‘ 
PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
There were 48 of these reported in 1883-’84, for statistics of which, see Tables IV, 
VI, and VII of the appendix to this volume, and for summaries of them, the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE. 
Dartmouth College, Hanover, for young men only, maintained in 1883~84 its usual 
high standard of instruction, with a total enrolment in all its departments of 402

students, under 42 instructors. These departments continued to be academic, scien- — 
tilic, agricnitural, and medical. The academic department has a 4-year classical 
course, with modern languages, mathematics, &c. Elective courses are provided, 
which include a Latin-scientifie course. q 
Students from such preparatory schools as have a thorough course of preparation 
for college, covering at least 3 years, continue to be admitted without examination, 
on the certificate of their principals that they have mastered the entire requisites 
for admission to the freshman class, or their equivalents, and have regu 
ated.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, connected with Dart- 
mouth College, presen(s a 4-year course of scientific training, and numerous elective 
studies render the course well adapted to the wants of students who desire prepara- 
tion for active life. One class of these elective studies includes the higher mathe- 
matics; another offers an extensive course in chemistry, with reference to analysis of 
agricultural products, assaying, and the general application of chemistry to the arts. 
The Chandler Scientific Department of Dartmouth College in 1883~84 had 74 students in 
its 4-year course. This department is for instruction in the practical and useful arts 
of life, special attention being given to mechanics and civil engineering, the inven- 
tion and manufacture of machinery, carpentry, masoury, architecture, and drawing. 
Modern languages, English literature, book-keeping, and other branches are taught. 
The Thayer School of Civil Engineering, another department of Dartmouth College, 
had 12 students in its 2-year course. This is strictly professional and essentially a 
graduate course. Graduates from either the Latin-scientific course or the Chandler 
Scientific Department of the college are considered to be prepared for the successful 
aR Opea pon. of the engineering course of the Thayer school. 
For statistics of these schools, see Table X of the appendix. 
| _ PROFESSIONAL, ' 
No schools of theology or law are known to exist in New Hampshire. 
The medical department of Dartmouth College in 1883~84 had a teaching force of 19, 
with 44 students. For admission candidates are examined to test their fitness to begin 
the study of medicine. For the degree of M. D. they must be 21 years of age, have 
attended 2 fall courses of lectures, and have devoted 3 years to professional studies. 
They must also give evidence of practice in dissection and pass a satisfactory exain- 
ination in all the studies of the course. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
New Hampshire provides for the instruction of its deaf-mutes in the Clarke Institu- 
tion, Northampton, Mass., and in the American Asylum for the Instruction of the Deaf 
and Dumb, Hartford, Conn., the former of which in 1884 had 1 pupil from this State ; 
the latter, 24. Provision is made for the instruction of the blind in the Perkins In- 
stitution, Boston, Mass. | 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The State Industrial School, Manchester, gives moral, educational, and industrial 
training to youthful offenders against the laws. During 1883 there were 149 inmates, 
62 Americans and 87 foreigners. The ordinary expenses for the year were $17,663, of 
which amount the boys earned over $6,000 in chair work, |

were ‘Study of United States history: its use and abuse,” ‘‘ Methods in geography, ” 
‘English literature,” and ‘‘ Needs of our schools.” An address was delivered by C. 6.

object of the school is the development of character through study faithfully and hon- : 
estly done; ranking should not be at all a matter of public honor or discredit or be 
used to promote one at the expense of another. Such ranking, he thong ne, as tempts 
to overwork, to superficial work, or to dishonesty should be condemned. ‘Books as 
auxiliaries in teaching” and the ‘‘ Greek question” were discussed. The tively dis- 
cussion on the latter subject. brought out the fact that the teachers in high schools 
and academies for the most part favored the retention of Greek in the course,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Because of a conflagration at the State house, in which the school records for 188384 
appear to have been consumed, no school report for that year has been issued up to 
the time at which this matter goesto press. The statistics of 188182 and 1882~83 aro 
therefore the latest available. These show a continuation of the progress that has 
marked the school history of the State for many years, the increase of enrolment in
-P-A-G-E-457
  
  NEW. JERSEY. 185 
all schools in the latter year going 1,181 beyond the increase in youth of school age, 
and the increase of average attendance in public schools going 3,602 beyond the in- 
crease of public schoolenrolment. The seats for pupils in the public schools, too, were 
increased in some fair proportion to the great increase in average attendance, while 
the average pay of teachers was better than it had been and the expenditure for 
public schools advanced $208,886. The whole report is creditable to the State, to the 
board of education that has had charge of general school interests, and to the State 
superintendent, Hon. Ellis A. Apgar, whose faithful field and office work for 19 years 
has greatly aided the development of the present excellent school system. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The general supervision of the public school system is committed to a State board 
of education, which appoints every third year a State superintendent of public in- 
struction and asuperintendent of public schools for each county, the latter subject to 
the approval of the board of freeholders in the county. For ordinary school districts 
(which must contain at least 75 children of school age) 3 trustees are elected by the 
people for 3 years, 1 being changed each year. The district trustees constitute a 
township board of trustees for each township, and meet the county superintendent ~ 
semiannually for consultation as to the management of schools. Women residing in 
a district are eligible to the office of district trustee if over 21 years of age and able to 
read and write, which qualifications are required of men also. Each district board 
has a clerk to record its proceedings, keep accounts, and take an annual census of 
school children. There are also State and county boards of examination to test the 
qualifications of applicants for teachers’ certificates, for which, see Preparation and 
Qualifications of Teachers, further on. The county and city superintendents together 
constitute the State Association of School Superintendents and meet annually, as the 
State board of education may direct. Teachers may suspend pupils from school for 
cause, but may not administer corporal punishment. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are made free to all resident children 5 to 18 years of age, regard- 
less of religion, nationality, or color, by the proceeds of a State school fund, by a 
State tax equal to $4 for each child of school age, and, when necessary, by additional 
amounts raised through township, city, and district taxation. Each district is en- 
titled to at least $200 of the school fund, and districts with 45 or more children get 
not less than $350, to be apportioned by county superintendents. To secure this aid 
districts must provide suitable school buildings and must have maintained a public 
school for at least 9 months during the preceding school year. Teachers to be entitled 
to pay must hold certificates of qualification and must have kept registers in the man- 
ner prescribed for the time for which the pay is asked. The State allows an annual 
appropriation of $100 for the expenses of each county teachers’ institute, and teachers 
are required to attend the institute held in the county where they teach. No portion 
of any school fund may be used for the support of sectarian schools. The State offers 
to any city, town, or township that will raise not less than $3,000 a like sum for the 
establishment of schools for the training of pupils in industrial and mechanical pur- 
suits, and afterward an annual contribution equal to that contributed in said locality, 
not to exceed $5,000. The State also encourages district libraries by giving $20 to 
any public school which hes raised a like amount to establish a library and to pro- 
vide chemical and philosophical apparatus, with an annual sum of $10 if the district 
shall have given the same. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The legislature of 1883 enacted (1) that the term of office of members of the board 
of education of any city shall be for as many years as there are members of such 
board elected from each ward: (2) that there shall not be assessed upon any inhab- 
itant of the State any poll tax in excess of the sum of $1; (3) that no boy under 12 
nor girl under 14 years of age may be employed in any factory, mine, or workshop ; 
that no child between the ages of 12 and 15 shall be so employed, unless such child 
shall have attended some public or private school for at least 12 conseeutive weeks 
or 2 terms of 6 weeks each within the year preceding such employment; and that no 
child under 14 years of age shall be employed in any such establishment longer than 
an average of 10 hours a day. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The school interests of each city or town are under the control of school boards, 
boards of education, or boards of school trustees, elected by the people. A city 
superintendent is usually the executive officer, and such persons as the board may 
appoint constitute a city board of examiners,

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Bayonne in 1882+’83 had in its school buildings accommodations for 1,564 pupils. 
Of the 3,286 youth of school age (5-18) it was estimated that 734 attended no school 
during the year and that 700 were in private and church schools. Public school 
buildings were in good condition and were valued, with other property, at $203,000. 
Bridgeton in 1882~83 reported an increase in school census and in enrolment and 
average attendance in the public schools. 
In 1883~84 there were 5 public school buildings, containing 30 rooms for study, val- 
ued, with other school property, at $45,000. The schools were taught 187 days by 13 
teachers for primary, 8 for grammar, and 9 for the high school. Private dehoala nad 
an enrolment of 200 pupils. 
Camden in 1882~83 had an increase in school children, in enrolment, and in average 
daily attendance, with the same number of teachers and a slight decrease in expendi- 
ture. 
In 1883~84 the statistics show about the same increase in all but the attendance, 
which was much larger. ne payment ot an indebtedness of $166,500 incurred in pre- 
vious years and the erection of new school buildings at a cost of $12,955 largely in- 
creased the expenditure for the year. School books were supplied for the use of the 
pupils at a cost of $5,718. The schools were taught 200 days in 13 buildings with 122 
rooms, and the evening schools in 2, Public school property was valued at $262,600. 
Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 2,000. 
Elizabeth in 1882~’83 reported primary, grammar, and high schools taught in 14 
buildings, with 2,453 ae a small increase in school youth and average attend- 
ance, and a corresponding decrease in enrolment. Evening schools were taught in 6 
rooms, with an enrolment of 328 boys and an average attendance of 147. 
In 1883~84 a slight decrease was noted in school population, with an increase in en- 
rolment and attendance. Enrolment in evening schools fell off to 230 during the year 
and average attendance to 125. Public school property was valued at $79,600. 
Enrolment in private and church schools, 2,260. r 
Hoboken in 1882~’83 reported an increase in school population and in average at- 
tendance and a small decrease in enrolment, with the same number of teachers. The 
day schools were taught 10 months; the evening schools, 41 evenings. 
x general advance in school work was reported for 188384. While good work was 
done in all departments there was a noticeable progress, in primary classes, in the 
adaptation of the instruction to the capacities of the children. New methods were 
ually being adopted instead of the routine teaching once so common. The train- 
ing in written and oral expression received great attention and the results were good 
in classes not overcrowded. School buildings improved greatly, though repairs were 
still needed, as well as increased accommodations. An evening school was taught 4

months, 512 pupils being enrolled and 228 in average attendance, irregularity of at- 
tendance forming, it is said, the great obstacle to the usefulness of the school. The 
public school system comprises also primary, grammar, and high grades and a city 
normal, Drawing (in charge of a special teacher) w: aught in the grammar and 
higher classes; German also formed a part of the course in these grades. 
Jersey City reported in 1882~83 8 in school census, of 451 in       
          
3 an increase of 
public school enrolment, and of 675 in average attendance ; also, more teachers and a 
larger expenditure. 
In 1883~’84 the schools were taught 195 days in 22 buildings, containing 300 rooms, 
with 14,694 sittings for study, the value of school property remaining about the 
same as the previous year, $628,820. Enrolment in private and church schools in- 
creased during the year from 13,200 to 14,215. 
Newark in 1882~’83 owned 28 schvol buildings and rented 7, with a total seating 
capacity of 16,000, Four new buildings were being erected, with accommodations for 
2,80 children. The system includes normal, high, grammar, intermediate, primary, 
industrial, colored, and evening schvols. Special attention was given to instruction 
in physiology and the laws of health throughout the primary and grammar depart- 
ments. The evening drawing school, established in 1882, had fully met the expecta- 
tions of its friends. The course of instruction includes mechanical, architectural, and 
free hand drawing and designing. Nearly all of the 120 pupils in attendance were 
engaged in some mechanical pursuit. The evening schools were even more than usu- 
ally successful. None but experienced teachers are employed in them and the same 
care and supervision are given to them as to the day schools, with as guod results. 
New Brunswick in 1882~e3 reported a small increase in enrolment and average at- 
tendance. In promptness and regularity of attendance as high a standard had been 
reached as was considered consistent with the health of pupils. The schools were 
classed as primary, grammar, and high, and were taught 204 daysin 6 buildings, with 
2,175 sittings, valued at $125,200. Private and church schools had an estimated en- 
rolment of 1,200. Considerable attention was given to school hygiene. The abolition 
of the general recess in schools was considered a step in that direction, and as far as 
tried the plan had given satisfaction. The health of pupils was said to be better; the 
discipline also improved and was maintained with less severity. 
Orange reported for 1882~83 an increase in youth of school age and enrolment, with 
a slight falling off in average attendance and a larger one in expenditure. 
In 1883-84 the public schools were taught 200 days in 4 buildings, with 1,422 sit- 
tings for study, valued, with other school property, at $100,000. Mnrolment in private 
schools, 1,200. 
Paterson in 1882-83 showed an increase of 357 in school youth, of 1,409 in enrolment, 
and of 1,176 in average attendance. To meet this increase there were 19 more teach- 
ers. Special teachers of drawing and penmanship were still employed. The city 
school system embraced primary, grammar, high, normal, and evenitig schools. 
Schools were taught 204 days in 12 buildings, with 8,325 sittings, all rated at $333,000. 
Enrolment in private schools, 1,450. Appropriations for school purposes had not for 
some time kept pace with the rapid growth of the city; consequently schools were 
overcrowded, even to the detriment of health. Another obstacle to the usefulness 
of the schools was tardiness and irregular attendance, leading to truancy and va- 
grancy and making truant schools necessary. 
Plainfield in 1882~83 reported a slight falling off in school youth and public school 
enrolment, with a small increase in average attendance and a large one in expenditure. 
Public schools were taught 10 months, school property was valued at $80,000, and 350 
pupils attended private schools. 
Trenton in 1882~83 reported 1,437 pupils, 18 per cent. of the school population, at- 
tending private schools, the public school enrolment given being 46 per cent. of it; 
thus leaving 36 per cent. without any school training in the capital of the State. 
Public schools were taught 10 months in 12 buildings, valued, with other school prop- 
erty, at $160,000, 
  PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS, 
To obtain employmentin the public schools, teachers must hold certificates of qualifi- 
cation from the State board of examiners, which consists of the State superintendent of 
public instruction and the principal of the State Normal School; frota county board 
of examiners, which consists of the county superintendent and 1 to 3 teachers appointed 
by him; or from a city board of examiners. The certificates of the State board are 
of 3 grades, the mighogy for life; the next, for 10 years; the third, for7 years. Those 
of the county boards are for 1, 3, and 5 years, the 5-year ones good thoughout the State. 
Graduates of the State normal school who have given evidence in its model school of 
ability to teach and govern also receive State certificates, :
-P-A-G-E-460
  168 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The New Jersey State Normal School, Trenton, offers free instruction to duly quali- 
fied persons who will pledge themselves to teach 2 years in the State; others pay a 
tuition fee of $50. During the year 1883~84 there was an attendance of 214 normal 
students and 445 pupils in the model school. The number of graduates was 27, of 
whom 25 engaged in teaching. The full course of instruction covers 3 years. 
The Farnum Preparatory School, Beverly, a branch of the State Normal School, 
with primary, intermediate, preparatory, and senior classes, prepares students for ad- 
vanced classes in the normal school, to which its graduates are admitted without 
examination. It also gives instruction in elocution, vocal and instrumental music, 
drawing, painting, French, and German, with other studies that prepare for college. 
Pupils are admitted at 6 years of age and upwards, the full course covering 10 years 
of 40 weeks each. During 1883~84 there were 163 pupils, 3 of whom were preparing 
for a scientific course in college. : 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
City normal schools or training departments form a part of the public school systems 
of Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken, and Paterson. That at Hoboken, though meeting only 
_ once a week from 9 to 12 o’clock, on Saturdays, was doing much for the professional 
training of the teachers of the city. The school at Newark reported satisfactory 
work done in 1882~’83, and that its graduates were sought after by the surrounding 
cities and towns. : 
At Bordentown Female College, Bordentown, there is also a course for students that 
desire to prepare for teaching. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County superintendents (in connection with city superintendents, if there be any in 
the county) must organize annually a teachers’ institute in their counties; and public 
school teachers attend in the county in which they teach, unless excused for cause. 
No deduction may be made from their salary for the time they are attending the in- 
stitute. During 1882~83 institutes were held at least in Atlantic, Bergen, Camden, 
Cumberland, Gloucester, Hudson, Middlesex, and Salem Counties. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report gives no definite information in regard to the high schools in the 
State. They are reported, however, in most of the principal cities. In 1882~83 the 
Jersey City High School enrolled 636 pupils, with an average attendance of 454, a 
greater number than in any previous year of its existence. The graduating class 
numbered 81. . 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools specially 
preparatory to college, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for summaries 
of the same, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR MEN. 
The institutions for superior instruction classed by this Office as colleges (all exclu- 
sively for young men) are, as heretofore, the College of New Jersey, Princeton (Pres- 
byterian), Rutgers College, New Brunswick (non-sectarian), St. Benedict’s College, 
Newark, and Seton Hall College, South Orange, the last two under Roman Catholic 
influence. The two first named continue to offer classical, scientific, special, and 
graduate courses of study; the other two, preparatory, classical, and commercial 
courses. The College of New Jersey in 1883-84 reported 55 graduate students, be- 
sides 465 undergraduates; Rutgers College, 17 engaged in graduate study and 368 
undergraduates, Gifts were received during the year by the College of New Jersey 
amounting to $153,000, of which $150,000 were from Mrs. Mary Stuart, ef New York 
City, for a professorship in the school of philosophy. 
For further statistics, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a summary, the report 
of the Commissiéner preceding. 
INSTITUT S FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The collegiate institutions for young women are Bordentown Female College, Bor- 
dentown; Pennington Seminary, Pennington; Freehold Young Ladies’ Seminary, 
Freehold ; and St. Mary’s Hall, Burlington. The first two are authorized by law to 
confer collegiate degrees. The college at Bordentown offers 3 courses of study in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-461
NEW JERSEY. 189 
collegiate department, besides one for normal training and departments of music and 
art. The seminary at Pennington admits both sexes, and presents 10 courses of 
study, including, besides the collegiate, a.college preparatory and courses in science, 
music, and art. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary 
of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Scientific instruction is given in Rutgers Scientific School, a department of Rut- 
gers College; in the John C. Green School of Science, connected with the College of 
New Jersey; and in the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken. 
Rutgers Scientific School, constituted by the legislature the State Agricultural 
College, includes in its curricula 3 distinct courses of scientific study, viz, in civil 
engineering and mechanics, in chemistry and agriculture, and a special course in 
agriculture, the last a short course of 2 years, the other 2 full courses of 4 years. Free 
scholarships in this department are given by county superintendents, on examination, 
to a limited number of students selected from the counties in proportion to the popu- 
lation of each. The instruction in the Stevens Institute includes training in element- 
ary and advanced mathematics and their application to mechanical construction; 
mechanical engineering, including construction of machines; mechanical drawing; 
shop practice in mechanics; and courses in physics, chemistry, and applied electricity. 
For statistics see Table X of the appendix, and for a summary, see the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
No schools for professional training were reported in 1823-84 except the following 
theological schools: Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church, Princeton; the 
Theological School of Newark, N.J., Bloomfield, also Presbyterian; Drew Theological 
Seminary, Madison (Methodist Episcopal) ; the Theological Seminary of the Reformed 
Church, New Brunswick; and the Diocesan Seminary of the Immaculate Conception, 
South Orange (Roman Catholic). 
All report a course of study extending over at least 3 years; all but the last named 
had also a graduate course, the whole number of undergraduates being 290, of whom 
212 had received a degree in letters or science. 
For further statistics, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary, see the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION, 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB 
The State Institution for the Deaf and Dumb of New Jersey, Trenton, was organ- 
ized in 1883, and had at the close of that year 68 pupils, representing 19 different 
counties. Under the law governing the institution, the length of term for which 
pupils may be maintained in the school at the expense of the State is 5 years, the 
Jowest limit of age for admission being also 5 years. The common school branches 
are taught, and the question of providing industrial training was under considera- 
tion. 
EDUCATION OF BLIND AND FEEBLE-MINDED CHILDREN. 
New Jersey makes provision for the education of its blind and feeble-minded chil- 
dren in special schools in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. There were 
43 blind thus provided for in 1882~83 and 40 in 1883~84, at a cost of $14,477 for the 
former year and $11,536 for the latter. The number of feeble-minded under trainin 
was 61 for 1882~83 and 69 for 1883~'84, at a cost of $14,978 for the former year nat 
$16,149 for the latter. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The New Jersey State Reform School, Jamesburg, established in 1867 for juvenile 
offenders, receives boys between the ages of 8 and 16 years. In 1883 there were 270 
instructed in the elementary branches of learning, and in agriculture, the manufact- 
ure of shirts, and other varieties of labor. The farm of the institution covers 490 
acres, and it contributed $6,761 in supplies for maintenance of the inmates. The 
gross earnings of the boys during the year were $19,816, of which $15,155 were earned 
in the shirt factory. 
The State Industrial School, for girls, Trenton, for 1883 reported 27 inmates being 
trained to lead useful lives. The girls are furnished with good homes at the end of 
their term of commitment, and the institution has many more applications for them 
than can be met. 
The Newark City Home, Verona, a reformatory and industrial institution, in 1883

received 73 boys and 14 girls and released on trial 59. Besides the elementary 
branches of learning the boys were taught brush making and farming; the girls, 
housekeeping and needlework, . 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
NEW JERSEY STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The New Jersey State Teachers’ Association held its meeting for 1883 at Newark, 
December 26 and 27, the president, Randall Spaulding, in the chair, The address of 
welcome and response were followed by a paper from the president on ‘‘ Conservatism,” 
in which he described a true conservative as one who unites the fire and force of 
youth with the clearer vision and prudence of age, who gathers from the past seed for 
present strength and present sowing, but whose eyes are directed towards a future 
harvest ; who lends an honest hearing to old custom but is never enslaved by it. 
Professor Seward, of Orange, presented an exposition of the tonic sol fa method of 
teaching vocal music and President M, E. Gates, of Rutgers College, gave an acd 
entitled ‘‘The teacher a determining power in the child’s life.” Other papers 
lowed on “Technical and art education as a means of mind culture” and on ‘ Illit- 
eracy and national aid to education,” the latter paper giving arguments in favor of 
leaving the care of schools in the hands of the State alone. A proposition laid he- 
fore the association in 1882, to request the legislature to substitute 7 normal schools, 
with sessions of 4 weeks, for district teachers’ institutes, was considered, but was not 
adopted.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The school work of 1882~’83, as shown by reports received, indicates improvement 
in mapy particulars. There was an increase in the numberof youth of school age, in 
the average attendance in public schools, and in the total number attending all schools, 
including those for higher and professional instruction. The average pay of public    
-P-A-G-E-464

(£92 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
school teachers increased, a larger number were employed 28 weeks or more, and 
more held normal school diplomas. A larger number of visits were made by school 
commissioners and there was an improvement in the character and value of school 
buildings. Over $400,000 more were expended for buildings, sites, furniture, and re- 
pairs, and $675,566 more were expended for all public school purposes. 
The report for 1882~’83 notes some improvement made during the year in the sani- 
tary condition of school buildings, although much deficiency in this respect remained. 
Considerable good had resulted from an amendment to the school law, made in 1882, 
providing that no school-house shall be built in the State until the plan of it, so far 
as ventilation, heat, and lighting are concerned, shall have been approved by the 
school commissioner of the district in which such house is to be built. The State 
board of health has given special attention to the sanitary condition of the school- 
houses, making systematic inquiries regarding it throughout the State, The result 
showed that only 1 in 15 was well fitted for protecting the health of pupils; that 
enerally ventilation was insufficient and the means for it badly designed. It was 
found that the experiment of omitting the forenoon and afternoon recess was being 
extensively made, with doubtful, probably injurious, results. It was also noticed 
that the physical benefit derived trom light gymnastics, so important to the health 
of pupils, particularly to the younger ones, was not suitably appreciated by the people. 
No exception was furnished in this year to the rule of annual decrease of volumes in 
distritt libraries. State Superintendent Ruggles renews suggestions heretofore made 
looking towards amendment of the law as to school libraries. He would restore 
the essential provisions of the old law previous to 1851, authorizing the several dis- 
tricts to raise by tax an amount for their libraries equal to that of their respective 
quotas of library money from the State, making the payment of the State quota de- 
pend on the raising of an equal sum by the district, the money to be rigidly appro- 
priated to the purchase of books. 
The school year 1883~’84 was an exceptional year in that it was shorter by about 6 
weeks than usual, owing to the fact that the legislature, in the year 1883, changed 
the date of its close from September 30 to August 20. This accounts for the falling off 
in certain statistical details which, from their nature, are necessarily affected by the 
matter of time. In particulars not thus affected the reports received from the various 
districts show decided improvement over the year preceding. With about 41,000 
fewer pupils enrolled, the average daily attendance was 13,000 greater, and the per 
cent. of attendance on the whole number enrolled was also greater. More pupils were 
taught in private schools and more attended academies, colleges, and professional 
schools. More teachers were employed 28 weeks or over and more attended insti- 
tutes. The expenditure for sites, buildings, and furniture was greater, although, 
naturally, the whole amount expended was less, and the estimated value of all school 
property increased by more than $900,000. | 
ADMINISTRATION, 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected by the legislature for 3 years, 
is at the head of public school affairs. Academic, collegiate, and professional training 
is under the direction of a board of regents of the university, of which board the 
superintendent is a member ex officio. Local school interests are administered by 
school commissioners,! elected by the people for 3 years, 1 for each school commis- 
sioner’s district, and by district boards of trustees, of 1 or 3 members in ordinary dis- 
tricts and of 3 to 9 in union districts. Women are eligible to school offices and may 
vote in school meetings. Trustees must make an annual report of school statistics to 
county commissioners, who in turn report to the superintendent and the latter to the 
legislature. 
Public schools are free to all residents 5 to 21 years old in the school district. 
Separate sehools for colored children may be established by the school authorities of 
cities or of union districts; but facilities for instruction must be provided in them 
equal to those in schools for white children. Separate arrangements are made for the 
instruction of Indian youth on reservations. The public school system includes union 
or graded schools, academies, teachers’ institutes, State normal schools, and institutions 
for the instruction of the deaf and of the blind. Provision is also made for instruc- 
tion of children in orphan asylums, for the care and instruction of idle and truant 
children, and for the compulsory attendance of children between 8 and 14 for at least 
14 weeks each year, unless instructed in the common school branches at home or other- 
wise. The employment during school hours of any child under 14 who has not re- 
ceived this amount of instruction the year preceding is prohibited under a penalty of 
$50. Free instruction in industrial drawing must be given in all cities and in union 
and free school districts under special acts, unless such districts are excused by the 
State superintendent. State normal schools must also teach this branch. I

FINANCES. 
Public schools are sustained from the income of a common school fund, of a United 
States deposit fund, of trust funds, and by the moneys coming from certain fines and 
penalties, as well as from State and local taxes. The amount of State tax, according 
to the last revised code, was one mill and a quarter on the dollar of taxable property. 
District taxes must be levied when necessary to cover a deficiency in public moneys . 
for teachers’ wages; and they may be levied for school-houses, sites, apparatus, and 
- libraries. To be entitled to their share of State school funds, districts must have 
sustained not less than 1 school, taught by a qualified teacher, for at least 28 weeks | 
in the preceding school year; and no public school money may be paid to an un- 
qualified teacher.

ADMINISTRATION. 
City public schools are managed by local boards of education, under special stat- 
utes, varying in the nature of their provisions. They are also under the supervision \ 
of local superintendents or clerks of local boards who perform the duty of super- 
vision and exercise powers and duties similar to those of school commissioners, with 
whom they are ranked in the State reports. Such superintendents report annually 
to their boards of education and also directly to the superintendent of public instrue- 
tion, embodying in their reports whatever facts the superintendent may require.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
In Albany the public school system comprises primary, grammar, and high schools 
and a teachers’ class, the last added’ to the course in 1882~’83, in which year there were 
26 school buildings. The prevalence of epidemic diseases caused a falling off in attend- 
ance, which, however, in 1483~84 reached a higher point than ever previously, for, 
though the registered number reported was somewhat less, owing to strict exclusion 
of duplicates, the average attendance was 393 more than in 1883. During the past 20 
years registered pupils have increased 210 per cent. and average attendance 350 per 
cent. Taking into account the 5,000 pupils estimated as belonging to private, academ- 
ical, and parochial schools, there were about 55 per cent. of youth 6 to 21 under instruc- 
tion. This limit exceeds the preferable school age, which is from 6 to 16, and on this 
basis the number under instruction was about 90 per cent., leaving only about 10 per 
cent. of the children of the city neglected. The superintendent insists that even thi 
is too jesge a proportion, and he renews his former suggestion that steps be taken to 
enforce the compulsory education act. | 
Considerable improvement was made in both 1882~83 and 1883-84 by the erection 
of 2 new buildings, costing $62,000, and by other additions to the seating capacity of 
schools, at a cost of $20,899 more. Resort to corporal punishment to maintain disci- 
pline is rapidly dying out, cases of suspension also becoming less. In the teachers’ 
training school pupils are required to practise such methods of government as will 
preclude the necessity of using the rod, and its entire disuse is looked forward aia 
the nearfuture. A trial of the new plan of dispensing with the noon recess confirmed 
the belief of school officers and Penstiers in its advantages over the old. By the new 
arrangement pupils of the first 3 years are given 10 minutes’ recess each session, the 
widest liberty of individual recess is allowed, and between the exercises opportunity 
is given for whispering and for physical movement. | 
Auburn has a course of study in primary, grammar, and high schools covering 12 
years. Schools were taught in 1882~83 for 200 dave. No changes had been m: i 
studies, nor in the general method of presenting them, A new feature in the 
school was the giving of renter prominence to rhetorical exercises. The most radi- 
cal measure of the board for many years was its discontinuance of the regents’ 
examinations for promotion after 1883. This was done after careful investigation and 
thoughtful consideration as to the best interests of the schools. The action is not ex- 
pected to result in a lower standard of scholarship, but in a greater freedom in theselec- 
tion of subjects of study and the methods of dealing with them. Some of the schools 
were at a disadvantage on account of their crowded condition. The discipline in all 
was good and was maintained without serious complaint as to strictness and severity. 
In response to a pressure for additional accommodations, a new building was finished 
in 1883, at a cost of nearly $11,000, with sittings for 200 pupils, and another one to 
cost $8,000 was contracted for. 
Binghamton reports public schools classed as primary, grammar, and high, taught 
during 1883~84 197 days in 10 school buildings, affording 3,216 sittings for study and 
valued, with other school property, at $228,411. There was an estimated enrolment 
of 542 in private and parochial schools. © 
The Brooklyn public schools in 1882~83 were taught 28.8 weeks by 70 men and 343 
women in 61 school-houses, of which 56 were brick and 5 frame, valued, with sites, 
at $3,300,000. The public school library comprised 18,000 volumes, valued at about 
$20,000. Because of a great deficiency of seats for pupils, particularly in the pri- 
mary grades, the city board of education has been endeavoring since 1882 to secure 
additional school buildings, with better arrangements for both health and comfort. 
The success achieved bas been far short of its desives, but enough advance in good

seating and good sanitary arrangements has been made to awaken a new interest in 
the matter among citizens and to encourage the hope that something like fair accom- 
modations for all pupils will be possible in the near future. At no time in the history 
of the schools, it is said, have so much care and thought been expended on school 
buildings with a view to combining economy and taste with conditions promotive of 
convenience and health as in the years 1883 and 1884, 
Buffalo, in addition to statistics already given, reported for 1882~’83 public schools 
taught an average of 40.4 weeks by 41 men and 459 women in 41 school-houses, of 
which 36 were brick, all valued, with sites, at $804,000; school libraries of 20,664 vol- 
umes, worth about $18,766; and 45 private schools, with 9,676 pupils. Of the teachers 
in the city system 71 had come from normal schools. ‘ 
In Cohoes in 188283 the public schools (primary, intermediate, grammar, and high) 
were taught 40.8 weeks by 4 men and 58 women in 9 school-houses, valued, with lots, 
at $100,000. The library comprised 1,845 volumes, worth $2,067. Two private 
schools were reported, with 800 pupils. In the city high school the English course is 
the regular graduating course, a classical one being intended for pupils expecting to 
enter college. 
Elmira reported in 1882~83 public schools taught 40 weeks by 7 men and 76 women 
in 8 school-houses, valued, with lots, at $309,450 ; a school library of 2,630 volumes, 
worth $2,700; and 8 private schools, with 610 pupils. Evidence of the good work done 
in the city system is given in the fact that, in the year, 95 pupils received at the re- 
gents’ examinations their preliminary certificates, 10 more than in any previous year; 
while at the regents’ advanced examination 491 successful papers were presented, 
21 pupils receiving the regents’ intermediate certificate and 9 their diploma. 
In_Hudson the public schools were taught an average of 40.4 weeks in 1882~83. 
Besides the pupils attending these, 7 private schools reported 600, making a total of 
1,874 under instruction, The 3 public school-houses, all of byick, were valued, with 
sites, at $39,500; the library, of 1,020 volumes, at $1,120. 
Ithaca opened its schools in 1832~83 with an unusually full attendance, but epi- 
demic diseases caused absence and tardiness and consequently less satisfactory results 
in the annual examinations. The pupils in the high school being less affected by dis- 
ease than those in the lower grades, the number enrolled and the average attendance 
increased considerably ; the number of non-resident pupils advanced over 60 per cent., 
and it is believed that the attendance might have been considerably increased had 
there been room to accommodate more. The crowded condition of the school made 
it impossible to continue the teachers’ class which had before been taught there. In 
November, 1883, it was decided to have a new high school building, to cost about 
$50,000 and to be one of the best in the State, with accommodations for 500 pupils, 
Kingston reports an increase during 188384 in pupils enrolled in public schools and 
in average daily attendance—a better record for attendance, in fact, than had been 
known before in the history of the schools. Good order was maintained without 
the use of physical force, except in very few instances; also, without any resort to ex- 
pulsion and with very few temporary suspensions. All seeming necessity for corporal, 
punishment in the schools is gradually disappearing. The schools are classed as pri- 
mary, junior, senior, and academic, this last including a preparatory department and 
an academic class, with two undergraduate courses of study, one in literature and . 
science and the other a college preparatory course. Beyond the last was a graduato 
course, with 12 students. 
Lockport in 1883~84 makes return of primary, grauimar, and high schools taught 
195 days in 7 buildings having 2,667 sittings and valued, with other public school 
roperty, at $105,500. Special teachers of German and penmanship were employed. 
There was an estimated attendance of 500 in private and parochial schools, 
At Long Island City, in the same year, public schools were taught 181 days in 7 
buildings, valued, with other school property, at $70,200; 6 of the 61 teachers held 
normal school diplomas, 1 was licensed by the State superintendent, and the re- 
mainder by local authorities. A special teacher wasemployed for music and German 
and one for drawing. Seven private schools were taught, with about 248 pupils 
attending. 
SvRabHeTE reports public schools taught 174 days in houses valued, with other school 
property, at $154,000, and an enrolment in private and parochial schools of 594, which, 
added to the number attending public schools, gives a total of 3,907. 
New York City reported for 1+83 297 schools under the supervision of the board of edu- 
cation, as follows: A normal college, a training department, 103 grammar schools, 113 
primary schools, 3 colored schools, 27 evening schools,1 nautical school, and 48 corporate 
schools, including industrial schools, reformatories, orphan asylums, &c. While the 
whole number enrolled in all these schools remained nearly the same as in 1882, the 
average daily attendance was 4,848 more, A large proportion of the increase (547) 
was in the primary and grammar schools, which have in the past 10 years advance 
about 38 per cent. During two years past the increase in the grammar schools 
has about equalled that in primary grades, though the whole number in grammar

  196 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schools is only about a third of that in primary schools, an indication that higher 
education is gradually making its benefits more manifest. Still, the highest grammar 
grade embraced only about 27 per cent. of the pupils who entered its first year in 
1879. Ninety per cent. of the average number enrolled in grammar and primary 
schools attended every session during the year. 
In all the schools 79 more teachers were employed than in 1882, and 44 more in 
the primary, grammar, colored, and training schools. Of 391 licenses granted, 70 
were to men and 321 to women, 247 of the latter being graduates of the normal school. 
Examination into the character of the instruction and discipline of the schools 
showed that in 1,895 classes the instruction was excellent; in 657, good; in 24, fair; 
that the discipline of 2,470 was excellent; of 167, good; of 12, fair. The general 
methods of discipline remained unchanged, punishment for neglect of duty or for dis- 
order consisting in a loss of marks, in detentions, and, in extreme cases, in suspension. 
Corporal punishment in any form is absolutely forbidden. During 1880 there were 
only 80 suspensions, fewer than in any previous year. The gradual diminution of this 
number, it is said, is only one of several indications of the improvement in discipline 
that has taken place during the past few years, other indications being a higher 
standard of scholarship, greater regularity in attendance, and increased punctuality. 
The 48 corporate schools participating in the school fund enrolled 28,211 pupils 
and had 9,979 in average attendance. Of these the 21 schools of the Children’s Aid 
Society enrolled 14,132; those of the American Female Guardian Society, 5,237. 
These schools supply a want felt in all populous cities among a class of people whose 
poverty is so great as to make the labor of children, for at least part of the time, 
necessary for the support of the family. While in the public schools absence for days 
or parts of days would materially interfere with progress, in the corporate schools 
instruction is adapted to the peculiar circumstances, the course of study for the pub- 
lic schools and their methods of instruction being followed, however, as far as possible. 
The character of instruction in the corporate schools was reported in 1882~83 to be 
excellent in 56 classes, good in 29, fair in 5, and indifferent in only 1. 
The 26 evening schools showed an increased attendance of pupils, accompanied by 
a steady improvement in instruction and discipline. These schools are divided into 
senior and junior grades; the former, admitting no pupil under 16, have an optional 
course of study, comprising reetng arithmetic, book-keeping, penmanship, and 
composition. Pupils may select any 2 of these studies, Classes for foreigners learn- 
ing English were formed in both grace, and their average attendance was nearly 40 
per cent. of that of the whole. The total enrolment was 20,910; average attendance, 
7,853. 
“Truancy decreased by 17 per cent. during the year. The 12 agents of truancy em- 
ployed to assist in enforcing the compulsory education law made more than 41,000 
visits during the year, about 12,000 to families and over 24,000 to stores and factories 
in which children were known to be employed. In all these establishments only 243 
instances were found in which there was a violation of the law, showing the gen- 
eral codperation of employers and the sympathy of the public in the matter of prop- 
erly instructing the young. 
Ogdensburg reports for 1883-84 schools taught by 48 teachers in 10 school buildings, 
» valued, with other school property, at_$71,000, and, besides 2,035 enrolled in public 
schools, about 560 in private and parochial schools. 
The Oswego public schools in 188384 were taught 196 days by 2 men and 61 women 
in 23 school buildings, with 2,920 sittings for study. All public school property was 
valued at $171,980. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 1,209. 
Poughkeepsie reports for 1882~83 a prosperous year in school work; a course of 
study extending over 12 years, of which 3 were in introductory grades, 3 in primary, 
2 in grammar, and 4 in high; a slight increase in the percentage of attendance on 
enrolment, although the total attendance was somewhat less than the previous year ; 
a continued improvement in drawing; and over 1,000 additions to the library, of 
which nearly 800 were giftsof citizens. The plan adopted two years ago of retaining 
the youngest children only half a day in school worked so well that it was proposed 
to adopt it in the next higher grade. Theexperiment of dispensing with the regular 
recess worked admirably. Each pupil is allowed to leave the room on request, and 
the time saved from the ordinary recess is taken off the length of the session. 
The Rochester public schools, embracing primary, intermediate, grammar, academic, 
and training departments, the last organized in 1883, were never before in so good a 
condition as during that year. The chief difficulty reported was insufficient school 
accommodations, occasioned by the growth of the city and the increase in public school 
attendance. A new school building was erected and others were repaired and im- 
proved, but, even with this additional provision, between 400 and 500 children were ex- 
cluded for want of accommodations. The report for 1884 shows a continuation of the 
favorable condition of previous years. Enrolment had still increased, rendering it 
necessary to occupy rented buildings. The per cent. of attendance was 96.08, a 
record never excelled in the history of theschools, Thesuperintendent thinks this in-
-P-A-G-E-469

creased attendance over other years is largely due to the abolition of the general re- 
cess, a measure first adopted in 1883, and Sion though meeting with strenuous op- 
position at first from some, had been finally accepted as a step in the right direction. 
In Rome public schools were taught 193 days in 1883~84, in 8 buildings, with 1,833 
sittings. Two special teachers were employed, one in drawing, one in penmanship, 
all the force but 3 being women. Public school property was valued at $81,000. 
Enrolment in private and parochial schools was 375. The schools were classed as 
primary, grammar, advanced, and academic, the last affording preparation for col- 
Jege as well as a full English course. 
Schenectady reports for 1883~84 public schools taught 192 days in 10 buildings, val- 
ued, with other school property, at $94,000, all the teachers but 3 being women. The 
estimated enrolmentin private and parochial schools was 800. 
While no marked changes occurred Syracuse claims progress made in school work 
during 1883. Ample accommodations were afforded the school children in 18 buildings, 
although some of these needed improvement in respect to heating and ventilation. 
A new building, perfect in these respects and capable of accommo a tite 850 pupils, 
was erected during the year. The system includes primary, junior, senior, and high 
schools, besides a training class for teachers, the course up to the high school covering 
8 years. Enrolment in the high school was 473, somewhat smaller than usual; the 
number of graduates, 43. Monthly teachers’ meetings were held,as usual. Corporal 
punishment is never resorted to in preserving discipline, and only 127 cases of suspen- 
sion, or about 1 in 100, occurred, and of those suspended all but 22 were reinstated. 
As for those not readmitted to the schools, the superintendent thinks they are better 
off outside, as in his view most of such cases arise from a dislike of school and a 
desire to engage in some kind of work; he thinks it better for a boy to be learning 
a trade if the teacher cannot inspire him with a love for books and the tradesman. 
can interest bim in tools. The figures for 1883~84 show a decrease of 211 in pupils 
registered in public schools and of 30 in the average daily attendance. This is ac- 
counted for by the increased attendance in parochial schools, which, with private 
schools, numbered 2,484 against 1,826 in 1883. The enrolment and average attend- 
ance in the high school increased somewhat during 1883~84. | 
Troy reports public schools taught in 14 buildings, public school property valued 
at $317,000, and about 1,500 attending private and parochial schools, making, with 
public school attendance, 9,798 under instruction. Attendance on public schools de- 
creased somewhat during the year, but the time lost by absentees was also less, 
making the ratio of attendance better. A large part of the loss was due to a vigorous 
agitation of the subject of founding and maintaining parochial schools, of which one 
was erected capable of receiving 600 pupils. Still, it is estimated that as many as 
5,000 youth between 5 and 16 years of age and about 3,000 between 5 and 13 were 
not attending any school. The public schools were primary, intermediate, grammar, 
and high, the last having 181 pupils enrolled and 162 in average attendance. 
Utica in 1883 had 35 public schools (primary, intermediate, advanced, ungraded, 
and evening) and a free academy, all taught in 18 substantial brick buildings, well 
lighted, well ventilated, and in other respects comfortable. A new and commodious 
building was completed during the year, nearly 700 volumes were added to the library, 
and over 8,000 more books were taken out. The demand for books of an instructive 
character was increasing: during four years the call for works of fiction had fallen off 
from 64 per cent. to 538. The free academy offers four courses of study: a normal of 
2 years, an ungtiae and scientific of 3, and two classical courses, one of 4 years, the 
other of 3. Of 160 pupils 127 were in average daily attendance. 
Watertown in 1883 shows primary, grammar, and high schools, the course extending 
over 12 years. The enrolment was somewhat less than during the previous year, 
though average attendance was about the same, and there were fewer cases of tardi- 
ness and about 64 hours less time lost. More select schools were taught and they 
drew somewhat from the public schools, the enrolment in them being about 100. 
The number of books lent from the library increased, but fewer novels were called 
for, the demand for useful books advancing. The high school offers two courses of 
study, classical and English, the latter subdivided into French, German, and Latin- 
English courses. Of 197 pupils enrolled 154 were in average attendance. 
Yonkers in 1884 reper public schools taught 199 days in 6 buildings by 3 men and 
43 women, public school property valued at $137,449, and an estimated enrolment of 
1,556 in private and parochial schools.

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
| 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
Teachers to be legally qualified for employment in the public schools must have a 
normal school diploma or a certificate of qualification from the State superintendent, 
the school commissioner of the district, or from the school officer of a city authorized
-P-A-G-E-470

198 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
by special act to grant the certificate. Certificates issued by the county com missioner 
and by the State superintendent are given only after an examination as to qualifica- 
tions. By a law of 1882 pupils instructed in teachers’ classes in academies and union 
free schools for at least 10 weeks, and who have passed an examination prescribed 
by the regents (which includes methods of teaching), are entitled to a certificate, 
and when this is indorsed by a school commissioner it constitutes a license to teach. 
The State superintendent may annul for cause any certificate granted by a commis- 
sioner and may declare any normal school diploma invalid as a qualification to teach. 
STATB NORMAL TRAINING. 
The 8 State normal schools, at Albany, Brockport, Buffalo, Cortland, Fredonia, 
Geneseo, Oswego, and Potsdam, report an attendance during 1883~84 of 2,393 pupils 
in normal studies, besides 2,691 other pupils. Of the normal students 300 graduated, 
making a total of 5,833 graduates since the opening of the schools. The shortening 
of the school year affected the figures of attendance in these as in other schools, the 
whole enrolment being 670 less than in 1882~’83, The number of graduates, however, 
was two more than that in the preceding year. 
These schools are all under the supervision of the State superintendent, the regents 
of the university being associated with him in the case of the Albany school. Tuition 
is free; so also is the use of text books; and to students who remain at least a full term 
travelling expenses are refunded. The State makes a regular allowance of $18,000 a 
year to each school, besides additional appropriations for special objects when neces- 
sary. Each county is entitled to send twice as many students as it has representa- 
tives in the assembly, and appointments are made by the State superintendent on the 
recommendation of the school commissioners or city superintendents of schools. Can- 
didates must be at least 16 years of age, must have good health and average abilities, 
and must pass a prescribed examination in English branches, including arithmetic as 
far assquareroot. All of these schools but one present 3 courses, extending over 2, 3, 
and 4 years. The school at Albany appears to offer only 1 course of 2 years. This 
school reports a new building in process of erection, for which the legislature of 1853 
ppprgerated $125,000, besides allowing whatever sum might be realized from the sale 
of the old building. | 
-The demand for normal school graduates as teachers in the better class of schools 
throughout the State is said to be increasing from year to year. Such teachers find 
ready employment at fair wages, and in some of the counties their number is becom- 
ing noticeably large. 
‘ OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Normal College, New York City, gave instruction in 1883~84 to 1,520 youn, 
women in a 4-year normal course and sent out 238 graduates. Although this schoo! 
has been in operation only since 1870, about half the teachers in the schools of the 
city are graduates from it. Tuition is free, the institution being a part of the public 
school system of the city. 
Classes for instruction in the science and practice of common school teaching were 
organized by authority of the regents of the university in 111 academies and union 
free schools, 16 more than during the previous year. The number of pupils receiving 
instruction was 1,875. These classes are under the supervision of an inspector ap- 
pointed by the regents, and are also subject to the visitation of the school commis- 
sioner of the district in which the school is situated, who is required to assist in the 
organization, management, and final examination of the classes, and to report thereon 
to the regents of the university. The number of classes and the number of pupils thus 
instructed increase yearly, and the beneficial results of the instruction are beginning 
to be felt in the schools near the localities where the classes are taught. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
It is made by law the duty of each school commissioner to organize each year a 
teachers’ institute in his own district, or,in connection with other commissioners, a 
combined institute for the county. He must, if possible, induce all the teachers of his 
district to attend, and there is no deduction from their pay for the time spent at the 
institute. 
Such meetings were held in 1883~'84, as during the preceding year, in 58 counties, 
at a cost to the State of $16,927, an increase of $1,156 over the cost in 1862~83. The 
number of institutes held was 71 against 73 the previous year; the aggregate attend- 
ance of teachers was about the same, the average number attending each institute 
being 10 more in 1884. The percentage of teachers attending in all the counties where 
institutes were held, based on the number teaching 28 weeks or more, was 81.99 against 
80.9 in 1883, 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The most important of the journals in thia State devoted ta the diffnsion of ednen- 
tional information are the (teowing: The School Journal, a weekly put alah ai Nea

York City; a monthly publication, The Teachers’ Institute, an abstract of the pre-

and The Industrial News, published monthly by the Inventors’ Institute, Cooper Union, 
in its fifth volume in 1884. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. | 
ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS. 
In this State two classes of institutions come under the general designation of acade- 
mies: (1) incorporated ones governed by boards of trustees and supported by the in- 
come of property and of tuition fees; (2) academical departments of union schools under 
the control of boards of education and supported chiefly by taxation. By a law of 1864 
provision was made for the organization of these academical departments and for their 
participation, subject to the visitation of the regents, in the privileges enjoyed by in- 
corporated academies; also, that incurporated academies may, with the consent of 
their trustees and of the district, be adopted as academical departments of union 
schools and permanently transferred to the board of education. Under these two pro- 
visions the number of academical departments of union schools has steadily increased 
and that of incorporated academies has diminished. In 1882~83 3 academies were in- 
corporated by the board of regents and 5 academical departments of union schools 
were received under visi The whole number of academies and of departments 
reporting for that year was 256; total attendance, 32,126, under 1,325 teachers. More 
than 7,000 of these students were pursuing classical studies, 2,252 my preparing for 
college, and 7,545 had passed the regents’ preliminary examination. In 1883~84 the 
aggregate attendance was 34,162, an increase for the year of more than 2,000.

preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, 
and for summaries, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. | 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
This university is composed of all the colleges, academies, and academic depart- 
ments of union schools in the State, the term college including all institutions in the 
State legally incorporated with power to confer collegiate degrees. Colleges of arts, 
Jaw schools, medical schools, and professional schools of science are thus embraced, 
but not schools of theology. The statistics of these colleges, so far as reported to the 
regents for 1882~83 (3 failing to report), showed property valued at $21,525,052; an 
expenditure for the year of $1,949,459; a total attendance of 10,236 students, under 
675 instructors; and 1,476 graduates. Of the students 3,626 belonged to 23 colleges of 
arts, 18 of them for men or for both sexes and 5 exclusively for women, 
COLLEGES OF ARTS FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
To the colleges of this class noticed in 1882 were added in 1883, by action of the 
regents of the university, Canisius College, Buffalo, and the Seminary of Our Lady of 
Angels, Suspension Bridge, the latter changing its title to ‘‘Niagara University.” 
For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix. 
From the regents’ report for 1882~83 it appears that the year was one of great ac- 
tivity among the colleges and that educational work was carried ‘on in them with 
energy ; in many, with increased advantages. Several of them received large addi- 
tions to their endowments and initiated movements towards fuller and more effective 
work. The report of the regents for 1883~84 has not been issued when this goes to 
press; but, from an examination of catalogues and returns for that year and from 
the report of the State superintendent, it appears that a like activity continued. The 
report of the State superintendent, published earlier than that of the regents, shows 
a total of 8,381 students in collegiate schools against 7,544 in 1882~83, these figures 
including, of course, those in preparatory and other departments as well as the prop- 
erly collegiate, which last were reported by the regents as 3,106 in 1862~83, 
Columbia College, New York, in 1883 completed, at much expense, extensive build- 
ings that had been long in process of erection for the better accommodation of its 
growing departments, and soa its large libraries into one noble structure, under 
the care of an experienced librarian. It followed some western colleges in a plan 
for granting degrees in certain cases on examination without residence (as did Syra- 
cuse University also), and agreed to admit women, on a systont similar to that of the 
Annex at Harvard, to study nnder its professars ond stan] examinations ‘

  200 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
f 
widow’s large property, which, at her son’s death, is to’go in money to the university, 
for the collegiate education of women under university auspices and officers. St 
Lawrence University had from the estate of Mrs. Sarah D. Gage $37,457 in fulfilment 
of a bequest for the maintenance of its school of theology. Cooper Union, New 
York, in addition to more than $1,000,000 bestowed on it by its venerable founder 
before his death, received from him by will, after his decease in 1888, $100,000, and 
from his children a like sum. Cornell University was relieved by special act of a 
restriction which had limited its corporate property to $3,000,000, and will probably 
be several millions richer by the change. For other benefactions in 1882~83, see In- 
stitutions for the Superior Instruction of Young Women, below. 
The information as to 1883~84 is still imperfect, but already there are announce- 
ments of the receipt of $5,000 by St. Stephen’s College, Annandale, for scholarships; 
of $14,476 by Syracuse University, for endowment; and of $85,C00 from Hon. Hiram 
Sibley, for a mechanical professorship and for additions to the Sibley shops and build- 
ing at Cornell University, Ithaca. 
Of the colleges belonging to the university system, at least 14 were still for young 
men only, while Alfred, St. Lawrence, Cornell, and Syracuse Universities admitted 
young women also. All continued their instruction in French and German, as well 
as in Latin and Greek, except St. Stephen’s College, which, as preparing for theo- 
logical study, substitutes Hebrew for German. With the same view, Hobart and 
St. Bonaventure Colleges also teach Hebrew, as do Alfred and Madison Universities. 
Columbia College and Cornell University offered Anglo-Saxon and Sanscrit also. The 
former was offered, too, at Hobart College and Madison and Syracuse Universities. At 
Columbia, Danish, Icelandic, Spanish, and Italian were included in the optional 
courses, and at Cornell, Swedish, Spanish, and Italian. 
Chautauqua University, an outgrowth of the Chautauqua Assembly and Reading 
Circle, was incorporated by the legislature in 1883 without the customary require- 
ment to report to the regents its course of study or its means for imparting instruc- 
tion. It is also left free from the usual university demand of at least a 4-year course 
of study, which enables it, if it should choose, to give diplomas and confer degrees 
without assurance of the time-honored preparation. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The 5 colleges for women already referred to as of full collegiate rank are Wells 
College, Aurora; Elmira Female College, Elmira ; Ingham University, Leroy; Rut- 
gers Female College, New York City, and Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, All present 
classical courses of 4 years, as previously, and all give instruction in music, drawing, 
painting, French, and German, Elmira adding Anglo-Saxon, and Rutgers, Spanish. 
All seem to prosper, though in different degrees. Ingham University was enabled 
by its friends in 1482~’83 to increase its property in grounds and buildings by the pur- 
chase of a chancellor’s residence for $5,000 and by the erection of an art annex at_a 
cost of $4,000; a debt of $11,660 was also met by contributions from its friends. In 
188384 Mr. Timothy Hill offered it $10,000 towards an endowment of $100,000, condi- 
tioned on the raising of $90,000 to make up the full amount. | 
Vassar College, too, had its preceding large endowments from the Vassar family in- 
creased by $50,000 for a scholarship fund and $80,000 for 2 professorships, all from 
Matthew Vassar, jr., in 1883. In 1884 John G. Vassar gave $10,000 for the improve- 
ment of the college laboratory. 
For detailed statistics of these colleges for women, in which the regents reported 
in 1882~83 a total of 520 collegiate students, under 81 instructors, see Table VIII of 
the appendix of this volume ; for like statistics of the colleges for men or for both 
sexes, see Table IX. For summaries of the statistics of both classes, see correspond- 
ing tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The United States Military Academy, West Point, established and sustained by the 
General Government to train officers for the Army, includes, with militaryinstruction, 
the study of English, French, and Spanish, international and military law, mathe- 
matics, drawing, natural and experimental philosophy, geography, history and ethics, 
chemistry, mineralogy, geology, engineering (civil as well as military ), and telegraphy. 
The course covers at least 4 years; no students are advanced from one year’s work 
to the next without a rigid examination on the studies passed over; if found deficient, 
they are put back or discharged. The number of cadets in 1883-84 was 284. _ i 
Cornell University, the agricultural and mechanical coliege of the State, besides its 
literary and special courses, offers 6 scientific courses of 4 years, leading to degrees in 
agriculture, architecture, analytical chemistry, chemistry and physics, electrical en- 
gineering, and civil engineering; also, another engineering course, of 5 years, and 
shorter courses leading to no degree. The degree of civil engineer is given only on
-P-A-G-E-473
NEW YORK. 201 
completion of the 5-year course, graduates of the 4-year course receiving that of 
bachelor of engineering. 
Three professional schools of science recognized by the regents are Rensseluer Poly- 
technic Institute, Troy, a school of civil engineering, conferring the degree of civil en- 
gineer; the School of Mines of Columbia College, in which the degrees of engineer of 
mines, civil engineer, and bachelor of philosophy are conferred; and the Scientific 
Department of Cooper Union, covering a course of mathematical and scientific study 
of 5 years and conferring the Cooper Union medal and diploma at its close. The 
number of students in these 3 institutions reported to the regents in 1882~’83 was 
3,774. A Oollege of Electrical Engineering, New York City, has been established to give: a 
scientific and practical knowledge of the systems of telegraphy in use in this and 
other countries for submarine and inland telegraphy, electric lighting, the telephone, 
and their commercial utilization. 
Instruction in civil engineering and in general science is given at the University of 
the City of New York and at Union and Syracuse Universities, while 15 other colle- 
giate institutions present courses for the degree of bachelor of science. 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theology.— Th following 10 schools of theology report for 1883 or for 1884: St. 
Bonaventure’s Seminary, Allegany (Roman Catholic); Auburn Theological Seminary, 
Auburn (Presbyterian); Canton Theological School, Canton (Universalist): Hart- 
wick Theological Seminary, Hartwick (Lutheran); General Theological Seminary of 
the Protestant Episcopal Church, New York; Union Theological Seminary of the City 
of New York CEnear yer) Rochester Theological Seminary, Rochester (Baptist); 
Christian Biblical Institute, Stanfordville, (Christian); Seminary of Our Lady of 
Angels, Suspension Bridge (Roman Catholic), and St. Joseph’s Provincial Seminary, 
Troy (Roman Catholic). Seven of these report 412 students in 1883-’84; the remain- 
ing 3 had, in 188283, 210. All report courses of study extending over at least 3 years, 
the 3 Roman Catholic institutions presenting courses of from 4} to 6 years, including 
preparatory as well as professional training. About half of the above named schools 
offer opportunities for graduate study and report students in them. The General 
Theological Seminary instituted such a course in 1883. | 
Delancey Divinity School, Geneva, and St. Andrew’s Divinity School, Syracuse 
(Protestant Episcopal), as well as Hamilton Theological School, Hamilton (Baptist), 
do not report to this Office for 1883 or 1884; but evidence of their continued existence 
appears in the year books of the Protestant Episcopal and Baptist Churches for 1884, 
which show that the two Episcopal schools had each 7 candidates for orders in 1882-83 
and that the seminary at Hamilton had 52 students, under 5 instructors. 
The Chautauqua School of Theology, formally opened in 1884, is an outgrowth of the 
Chautauqua work in the direction of ministerial culture. It gives the usual biblical, 
theological, ecclesiastical, historical, and philosophical instruction. Two depart- 
ments have been provided, one leading to a diploma in theology, the other presenting 
a course of reading and study for ministers and others who desire the benefit of the 
school without being subjected to the examinations required of regular students. 
The number of students in 1883~84 was 307. 
Gifts were received by the above theological schools, as reported, during 1883 and 
1884 amounting to over $376,000. Chief among these were $37,400 from Miss Sarah 
A. Gage to the Canton Theological School in St. Lawrence University, Canton; 
$81,928 to the General Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, New 
York; $23,800 to Rochester Theological Seminary; and about $225,000 to Union Theo- 
logical Seminary, New York, for library hall and scholarships. | 
nstruction in law was given in the following schools: Albany Law School, Albany, 
a department of Union University ; Maynard-Knox Law School, a department of Ham- 
ilton College, Clinton; School of Law of Columbia College, New York, and Depart- 
ment of Law of the University of the City of New York. These schools, which form 
a part of the University of the State of New York, reported to the regents an attend- 
ance of 506 students, under 20 instructors, and.215 graduates sent outin 1883. In 1884 
the students numbered 511. 
Medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy.—The regents, for 1883, report 9 schools of medi- 
cine, 1 of dentistry, 3 of veterinary science, and 3 of pharmacy. These reported 2,330 
students, under 214 instructors, in 1883. This list excludes the medical department 
of Niagara University, organized in 1883; the New York Medical College and Hospital 
for Women, which had made no report to the regents for several years; and 2 colleges 
whose charters had been declared invalid by the courts. 
The list of medical schools in New York, published by the Illinois State board of 
health for 1883-84, not including schools of dentistry and pharmacy, comprises 12 in- 
stitutions which reported 2,264 matriculates, of whom 660 were graduated,

202 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The New York College of Dentistry, New York City, reports 142 students and 30 grad- 
uates in 188384; it has a 2-year course of study, 20 weeks each year; there is no ex- 
amination for admission. 
The Albany College of Pharmacy, a department of Union University, reports 37 stu- 
dents and 13 graduates; the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, 330 in 1684. 
The course in both extends over 2 years; in the college at Albany, of 20 weeks each; 
in the other, of 22 weeks, s 
For statistics of professional schools, see Tables XI to XIII of the appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SOCIETIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF HOME STUDY. 
The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, organized in 1878 to encourage study 
at home, reported in 1882 an enrolment of nearly 30,000 members living in every State 
and Territory of the Union, as well assome in other quarters of the globe, It gradu- 
ated in 182 its first class of nearly 2,000 members. In 1883 the institution was in- 
corporated by the State legislature and authorized by law to confer the usual colle- 
giate degrees, but without being restricted to any standard or obliged to report to 
the regents its course of study or means for imparting instruction. 
The Correspondence University, a new institution somewhat resembling the 
above in its methods and aims, can only be said to belong in this State from the fact 
that its secretary, Professor Wait, is of Cornell University, Ithaca. Its faculty in- 
cludes 32 professors, selected from colleges here and in Great Britain. It publishes 
in Chicago, Ill., a paper entitled The Correspondence University Journal, which 
presents full statements of its courses in all subjects. 
EDUCATION FOR POLITICAL LIFE. 
Courses of special training in political science are given at Columbia College, New 
York, and at Cornell University, Ithaca. That at Columbia covers, as when last 
reported, 3 years from the opening of the senior year; that at Cornell, 4 years, of which 
2 are comparatively elementary. Graduate courses in the same study are offered at 
Columbia. All tendency to party views, as such, is carefully avoided. 
TRAINING IN ARTS AND TRADES. 
Cooper Union, New York City, besides its courses in science, gives instruction in 
free art and industrial classes, taught both day and evening, as follows: An art school 
for women ; school for women in wood engraving; school of telegraphy; classes in 
phonography and type writing for women; free night school of art for men. The 
amount earned by the pupils of 1883-84 and the graduates of 1883, so far as heard 
from, was $27,751. Many instances of success on the part of graduates of the wom- 
en’s art school are reported. The whole number of pupils in it in 1883~84 was 4,327; 
the number using the reading room and library, 549,707, of whom 6,664 were women. 
A number of art schools and societies for promoting a knowledge of art report from 
New York City, among them the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Drawing School of 
the Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, the art department of the Turnschule, the 
Decorative Art Society, the Woman’s Institute of Technical Design, and the New 
York Trade Schools. Including the 1,000 pupils in the art and_technical schools of 
the Cooper Union, it is estimated that there are in New York City alone over 2,000 
students of industrial art, whose influence must be felt within a short time in all the 
trades of the city. Encouraging results are already apparent in an advance in every 
department that requires artistic workmanship. : 
Courses in painting, drawing, and music form a part of the instruction offered in 
Syracuse University, Wells College, Elmira College, Rutgers Female College, and 
Vassar; painting and drawing are taught in the University of the City of New York, 
while drawing (architectural, free hand, and mechanical) is taught in the engineer- 
ing courses of the various colleges already noted under Scientific. 
The College of Electrical Engineering, New York City, recently organized, has been 
already noticed under Scientific, 
TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR NURSES. 
Nine schools to prepare women for intelligent care of the sick report from this 
State for 1883 or 1884: New York State Schoo! for Training Nurses, Brooklyn, opened 
in 1871; Bellevue Hospital School for Nurses, New York, opened in 1873; Charity and 
Maternity Hospital School for Nurses, Blackwell’s Island, 1875; New York Hospital

TRAINING IN MUSIC AND LANGUAGES, 
Special schools of music reporting are the Grand Goukore ated of Music, New 
York City; the Philharmonic Society of New York; the School of Music, Poughkeep- 
sie, and Columbia Conservatory of Music, Brooklyn. The last named reports thorough 
courses of musical instruction, vocal and instrumental, including the use of a large 
number of instruments; also, instruction in elocution, foreign languages, and dancing. 
There are also special schools of languages, the mostimportant being Stern’s School 
of Languages, New York, in which French, Spanish, German, and Italian are taught 
according to what is termed the natural method, i. e., beginning not with rules, but 
with the spoken words of the language to be learned. his school maintains a free 
normal class for teachers, one of the aims being to extend the knowledge of the 
methods of instruction followed. About 700 pupils received instruction in 1883. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The institutions for the deaf and dumb are as follows: New York Institution for 
the Deaf and Dumb, New York, which reported 390 pupils under instruction during 
the year 1883-’84; Institution for the Improved Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, 
New York, with 163; the Central New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Rome, with 
148; Le Couteulx St. Mary’s Deaf and Dumb Asylum, Buffalo, with 139; St. Joseph’s 
Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Fordham, with 250; Western 
New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Rochester, with 161, and Northern New York 
Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Malone. The whole number reported under instruction 
was 1,251. The last named institution was opened in September, 1884, with about 20 
pupils. It occupies a rented building and its accommedations are limited. With the 
others, it receives, under the law, a pro rata appropriation from the State. Total 
expenditures for the year in all these schools, $362,699, against $391,129 in 1882~’83, 
when there were 52 fewer pupils. 
All teach the common English branches, including articulation, and such employ- 
ments as shoemaking, tailoring, printing, dressmaking, and housework. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, 
The New York State Institution for the Blind, Batavia, and the New York City In- 
stitution for the Blind report an average of 353 pupils in 1883~84, against 400 the 
previous year. This reduction was due to an epidemic in the city institution, in con- 
sequence of which the schools were temporarily closed and the pupils sent home. The 
expenditure for both institutions during the year was $165,698 against $134,619 in 
1882~83, an increase of over $31,000. The common and eae English branches are 
taught, with music, piano tuning, broom making, sewing, knitting, and fancy work. 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The State sustains two institutions for the care and instruction of this class: The 
New York Asylum for Idiots, at Syracuse, and the Custodial Branch, at Newark. 
That at Syracuse is for children only, and gives them generally 7 years’ instruction; 
it has a farm department near the city for idiotic and feeble-minded men, in which 
about 30 are maintained. Average number of inmates during the year, 326; aver- 
age weekly cost for education, maintenance, and care, $3.33 for each pupil. The 
Newark Custodial Branch Asylum is devoted entirely to the oversight and care of 
idiotic and feeble-minded young women, and is under the control and management 
of the Syracuse Institution. An average of 140 were cared for during the year, most of 
them between the ages of 15 and 40. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS, 
Some industrial training in connection with instruction in the common school 
branches is given by a large number of institutions and societies to about 10,000 chil- 
dren each year, these being generally of a class who, from poverty, are deprived of 
other means of training. Among these institutions may be mentioned the schools of 
the Children’s Aid Society, New York City; the Brooklyn Children’s Aid Society ; the 
Brooklyn Industrial School Association ; the American Female Guardian Society, New 
York City; House of the Good Shepherd, Tomkins Cove; the Five Points House of 
Industry, New York City; the Hebrew Benevolent Society, New York City; the Wil- 
son Industrial School for Girls, New York City, and the Industrial School of Rochester. 
REFORMATORIES. 
There were over 4,000 juvenile delinquentsin the various reformatories of the State 
October 1, 1884, about one-third of them being girls. The New York House of Refuge, 
Randall’s Island, reports 758; the Western House of Refuge, Rochester, 513; the New 
York Juvenile Asylum, New York, 941; New York Catholic Protectory, West Chester, 
2.051, and Rnffalo Cathatie Protectary far Raves, 191, The frst tere named are mata.

  and municipal authorities. All give instruction in the common English branches and in various industries. | 
In regard to the House of Refuge on Randall’s Island the board of charities has recommended various changes, among them the abclition of stone cells with iron doors and the substitution of a more open system, on the family plan; a reduction 
in the number of corporal punishments, these to be inflicted only by the superin- 
tendent or matron or by their direction and in their presence; the inauguration of a 
system of rewards to stimulate the ambition of children; and the abolition of the con- 
tract system for boys, a comprehensive system of trades to be substituted for it. 
Some improvements were made in the grounds and buildings of the New York Ju- venile Asylum during 1883~84 and some necessary conveniences were furnished the 
inmates, but the institution was found to be overcrowded and the administration of 
corporal punishment not surrounded with sufficient checks. The State board of 
charities invites the attention of the legislature to a report of its committee on this 
subject, and believes its recommendations should be carried out, as they have been in 
the case of the New York Catholic Protectory. 
ORPHAN ASYLUMS AND HOMES. 
There were reported by the State board of charities 192 orphan asylums and homes 
for the friendless, with 42,773 inmates during the year 1883-’84, af whom 21,736 were 
youth, 11,641 boys and 10,095 girls. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, 
The thirty-ninth annual meeting of this association was held at Elmira July 9-11, 
1884, Addresses of welcome were given by Professor Steel and Mayor Flood, of El- 
mira, followed by the address of the president, Mr. Barnes. On the second day a pre- 
liminary report was made by the committee on education, which, among other evi- 
dences of progress, noted that increasing attention is being paid to the health and 
eyesight of pupils and to the preparation of teachers. The report led to an animated 
debate, which resulted in the appointment of a committee to devise a plan for secur- 
ing better work from school trustees. A paper read by Commissioner J. T. Lusk, of 
Binghamton, showed the difference in taxation, appropriation, and length of school 
terms in different cities, villages, and districts of the State; Mr. A. H. Dundon fol- 
lowed on the practical importance of the imagination and its cultivation in school. 
After some discussion of Mr. Dundon’s paper, one was read on the teaching of geog- 
raphy. In the afternoon Mr. Lusk’s paper was discussed and the evening was de- 
voted to an address by Chancellor Sims, of Syracuse University, entitled “ Person- 
ality in the teacher’s work.” The session of the following day was opened with a 
historical paper from Noah T. Clark, on ‘Academic education in this State one hun- 
dred years ago.” Other papers were on “Educational humbug,” by Jerome Allen, 
PH. D., of St. Cloud, Minn.; ‘Self culture,” by J. M. Milne, of Cortland; ‘The 
relation of theory and practice,” by Edward E. Sheib, PH. D., of Baltimore, and the 
“ Relation of art to education,” by Rev. A. W. Cowles, of Elmira Female College. 
STATE COUNCIL OF SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The second annual meeting of the council of school superintendents was held in Al- 
bany, Thursday and Friday, November 20 and 21, 1884. The topics for discussion were 
of the most practical character, including examinations of teachers; methods of teach- 
ing reading, spelling, and language ; how much technical grammar should be taught; 
Kindergarten methods applied to primary school work; and training schools for teach- 
ers: are they essential in the present stage of the profession of teaching ? 
STATE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COMMISSIONERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The twenty-ninth annual meeting of school commissioners and superintendents was 
held at Rochester, January 16-18, 1884. The program included addresses on the rela- 
tion of the teachers’ class to the country schools, on the value of the teachers’ institute 
to country teachers, school supervision, and normal schools as training schools for 
country school teachers. 
OTHER STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
The twenty-second university convocation and the centennial anniversary of the 
organization of the board of regents of the university were held at Albany, July 8-10, 
1884. These meetings were characterized by a lively interest in educational matters, 
and interesting papers were read and discussed, of which, however, no detailed report 
has been received.

OBITUARY RECORD. 
PETER COOPER. 
This most conspicuous promoter of education in New York City was born there Feb- 
ruary 12,1791. His early life was one of labor and struggle. When very young he 
assisted his father in his business, the manufacture of hats, attending school only for 
half of each day for a single year. At the age of 17 he was apprenticed to a coach- 
maker. Soon after finishing his apprenticeship he invented an improvement in 
machines for shearing cloth, from which he realized a large profit. In 1830 he built, 
after his own design, the first steam engine ever constructed on this continent. He 
took great interest in the extension of the electric telegraph and engaged in various 
manufactures, one of the most important being that of iron, and perhaps the most 
profitable that of glue and isinglass, which last he continued to carry on for over 50 
years. As capitalist and manufacturer, inventor and philanthropist, he was connected 
with some of the most important and useful accessions to the industrial arts of the 
country, its progress in invention, and the promotion of educational and benevolent 
institutions. He was a trustee of the Public School Society first formed to promote 
public schools in New York, and when that was merged in the board of education he 
became a school commissioner. The most cherished object of his life, carried out as 
soon as his means would permit, was the establishment of an institution for industrial 
training. Having himself felt the need of such instruction, which the common school, 
academy, and college all failed to supply, he determined to set an example in pro- 
viding for it that should not only prove useful in New York City, but contagious 
throughout the country. In 1854 he laid the cornerstone of the Cooper Union in New 
York, ‘‘to be devoted forever to the union of art and science in their application to the 
useful purposes of life.” The institution has admirably filled the place for which it 
was created and has continued to grow steadily under the fostering care of its founder. 
Besides the building, which cost $650,000, he annually made large gifts to supplement 
its income, and before his death provided it with a cash endowment of $200,000, to 
which his will added $100,000, his children contributing $100,000 more. Mr. Cooper 
died April 4, 1883, in the ninety-second year of his age, having preserved to the last 
a remarkable degree of vigor, both of body and mind,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM, 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State report for 188283 and 1883~84 shows a decided improvement since the, 
two preceding years. Then there appeared many items with large decrease; now 
almost all show handsome progress, together with large additions to public school,
-P-A-G-E-479

enrolment and attendance. There are also indications of a deep and widespread feel- 
ing in the State in favor of better education for all classes. In 1881~’82 the enrolment 
of colored youth in public schools fell off 12,169; the average attendance of such 
outh, still more. In 1883~84 the colored people seem not only to have made up that 
oss, but also to have made a great advance, 1882~83 showing 10,275 more of their chil- 
dren in the public schools and 13,763 more in average attendance. In the following 
year the enrolment of colored youth was 12,728 higher still, and there were 9,89! 
more in average attendance. In the character of the schools for both raves there is 
also indication of improvement. Numerous normal schools are doing effective work 
and teachers from other States are bringing into the graded schools the most approved 
new methods of instruction. Three useful educational journals, well conducted and 
apparently well patronized, are further tokens of awakened interest in education. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For the State the law provides a board of education and a State superintendent of 
public instruction ; for counties, boards of education and superintendents; for each 
district, a school committee of 3. No branches are required to be taught except spell- 
ing, defining, reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and the 
history of the State and of the United States. Other branches are allowed by special 
arrangements with the school committee. Teachers, at the close of each term, must 
report to the school committee of the district the prescribed statistics of their schools 
as a condition of receiving pay. They are also required to maintain good order and 
discipline in their schools; to encourage morality, industry, and neatness; and to 
teach thoroughly all the branches required to be taught. Provision is made for hold- 
ing teachers’ institutes in each county or in two or more counties combining, and 
when so held teachers in such county or counties are required to attend. The State 
board of education recommends the text books to be used in the public schools for a 
term of 3 years and until otherwise ordered. The school committees report the teach- 
ers’ returns to the county superintendents, and they to the State superintendent. 
Schools for the two races are to be kept separate. Sectarian and political books are 
prohibited. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The public schools, free to all children in the State between 6 and 21 years, are sus- 
tained by the income of a State school fund; by at least three-fourths of the pro- 
ceeds of a State and county poll tax, which under the constitution must not exceed 
$2; by an educational tax of 12} cents on $100 of the property and credits in the State 
and. 37} cents on every poll; by the net proceeds from sales of estrays, from fines for 
breaches of the penal and military laws, and from sxempucns from military duties; 
and by proceeds from licenses to auctioneers and to dealers: in intoxicating liquors. 
If the above shall be insufficient to support one or more schools in each district for 
4 months, a special annual tax must be levied in each county. The State board of 
education apportions the school fund to the counties on the basis of school popula- 
tion as ascertained by an annual census, and the county boards to the districts on the 
same basis,' specifying the respective amounts going to white and colored schools, 
the funds for these being kept separate by the treasurer of the county boards. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
North Carolina in 1882~’83 received $8,350 from the Peabody trustees: $4,650 of it 
for public schools, $1,400 for teachers’ institutes, $100 for the North Carolina Educa- 
tional Journal, and $2,200 for normal training of teachers at Nashville. In 1883~84 
the State allowance was $6,075, of which $2,175 were for Nashville scholarships, $400 
for teachers’ institutes, and $3,500 for public schools. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
An act of 1883 amending the school law of 1881 makes the following changes: (1) The school committee of any district may transact the business of the county 
superintendent in case a vacancy occurs; (2) school committees are to be elected 
biennially in October instead of in December, their term of service to begin the first Monday in December ; & no order given by a school committee for apparatus is to 
be valid without the indorsement of the county superintendent and approval of the 
county board of education; (4) a third grade certificate shall not be issued unless 
the applicant answer at least 70 per cent. of the examination questions; (5) the 
clause making it the duty of a county superintendent to visit and regularly inspect 
the public schools of his county is repealed, and he may suspend a teacher only with the concurrence of a majority of the school committee of the district in which the 
teacher is employed; (6) the daily pay of the county superintendent is reduced from 
$3 to $2 and he must render under oath an itemized account of his services, his salary   
1 From 1885 the apportionment will be two-thirds on school population ; the remainder, so as to equal- ize school advantages.
-P-A-G-E-480
  208 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
never to exceed 3 per cent. of the school money apportioned to the county; and 
(7) members of school committees are to be exempt from jury service and from work on 
public roads. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
As yet no general provision for city school systems appears in the State school laws, 
In townships embracing a city of 5,000 or more inhabitants graded schools may be 
established, and a tax not to exceed one-tenth of 1 per cent. on property and 30 cents 
on the poll is authorized for their support. 
STATISTICS. 
Raleigh and Wilmington, although they have each over 7,500 inhabitants, the mini- 
mum population of cities noticed in Table II of the appendix to this report, make no 
returns to this Bureau for 1883~84. * 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For full statistics of these schools reporting, see Table V of the appendix. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
The law requires of each county superintendent that he examine applicants for 
teachers’ certificates, and issue the same, of 3 grades, according to the following 
standards of qualification: A first grade to those whose general average is 90 per cent. 
or more; second grade, if 80 per cent. or more; third grade, if 70 per cent. on all ex- 
amination questions. A special third grade certificate on the basis of proficiency in 
fundamental primary studies is also provided for. These certificates are valid for 
one year, but only in the county where they are issued. No teacher may be employed 
ane does not hold a certificate, pay being regulated by the grade of the certificate 
eld. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
Ten State schools for training teachers appear in the State superintendent’s report 
for 1882-83, with a total attendance of 1,610, under 69 regular instructors and several 
Jecturers. Five of these were for whites and 5 for colored ; the latter continued 
through the school year; the former, for about a month. 
Nine such schools report for 1883~84, 5 of them for whites and 4 for colored. The 
5 schools for whites show 44 instructors, 789 students, and $4,520 of appropriations, 
of which $420 were from the Peabody fund. The 4 schools for colored reported 17 in- 
structors, 1,063 students, and $4,697 of appropriations, $647 being from the Peabody 
fund. 
Besides providing these normal schools, the State, by an act of 1881, requires free 
county students at the university to pledge themselves to teach in some school of the 
State for atleast half the time that they receive free tuition. Such students will 
naturally have some training in the university normal school. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. . 
Besides the above schools there are 6 private normals reporting in 1883-’84, employ- 
ing 39 instructors, with 1,205 students, making in the State an aggregate for this year 
of 15 normal schools, with 100 instructors and 3,057 students. Of these institutions 
the Shaw University Normal School, Raleigh; the American Missionary Association 
Normal School, Wilmington; and the Tileston Normal School, also at Wilmington, all 
with an aggregate of 24 instructors and 882 students, were for the training of colored 
teachers. 
Of the 15 normal schools reporting, 1 was opened in 1880 and 6 in 1881. Of the 
whole number, 7 are for the training of colored teachers, 4 of which are State schools. 
For the statistics of each of these various schools, see Table III of the appendix; for 
summaries of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The North Carolina Educational Journal, an official organ of the State Teachers’ 
Association, published monthly at Chapel Hill, continued in its fourth volume in 1884 
to give valuable information to the teachers and friends of education in the State. 
‘he Light-House and Tileston Recorder, a monthly journal published at Wilming- 
ton, also in its fourth volume in 1884, gave some general educational information, 
though it was mainly devoted to the interests of the Tileston Normal School. 
The North Carolina Teacher, a useful monthly, began its issues at Raleigh, June, 
1883, and _entered.on its second volume July, 1884,

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Although no statement has reached this Office as to high schools, there is informa- 
tion that the graded schools, which have been rapidly established in almost every town 
of any considerable size in the State, have given a great impulse to public education. 
The proceeds of the regular tax have been largely supplemented by a local optional 
tax which has kept these schools going for 9 months of the year. The Light-House 
and Tileston Recorder, of Wilmington, says that the germ of this important educational 
movement was the Tileston Normal School, established in Wilmington at the close of 
the war by Miss Bradley and sustained by Mrs. Hemenway of Boston. In 1867 Miss 
Bradley opened there a union graded school, and 3 years afterward the Hemenway 
graded school, both now free public schools for the white children of Wilmington, 
thus convincing the people that a public school could be made worthy of the patronage 
of the best people and that female teachers could do it. From this and the centen- 
nial graded school, established at Raleigh in 1876, the graded school idea is said to 
have expanded until there are schools of this class in successful operation in at least 
14 of the larger towns in the State, with prospects of further progress, These schools 
are said to be superintended by men well qualified, and are all well sustained, some 
enrolling more than 500 pupils each. Graded schools in 1884 received $2,700 from 
the Peabody fund. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools, such as business colleges, academies, 
and preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix; 
for summaries of same, corresponding tables in report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of North Carolina continues to offer 3 general courses of 4 years 
each: the classical, leading to the degree of A. B.; philosophical, leading to the de- 
gree of PH. B.; and scientilic, leading to the degree of B. s. These courses are pur- 
sued in 16 subordinate colleges or schools, each presenting its appropriate studies. 
There is also a teachers’ course of 2 years, opened in 1883, embracing all the studies 
required by law to be mastered by public school teachers. 
Opticnal courses are provided for such as are allowed to take studies out of the 
regular courses, Beyond the regular courses are graduate courses leading to the de- 
grees of PH. B., A. M., and M. 8, 
For the statistics of the above and of 8 other universities and colleges reporting 
in 1883-84, see Table IX of the appendix ; for summaries of the same, see a corre- 
sponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 12 colleges of this class heretofore reporting, 2 make returns for 1882-’83 and 
8 for 1883~84. or statistics of these, see Table VIII of the appendix; for summaries 
of them, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific course of the State university, covering 4 years, includes the studies 
that relate to the practical pursuits of life, especially those relating to agriculture and 
the mechanic arts, with mathematics, German and French, and such English studies 
as fit students to be useful citizens. There is a philosophical course of 4 years for 
those wishing to study only one ancient language, either Latin or Greek. This allows 
of greater devotion to scientificand English studies. There isalso an optional course 
for students of limited time and means, by which they may obtain purely agricultural 
instruction in branches deemed of special value. 
Biddle University and Trinity and Wake Forest Colleges show somewhat advanced 
scientific courses of 3 years each; Davidson and Weaverville Colleges, scientific 
courses, that of the former of 4 years for such as wish to pursue a select course to the 
exclusion of the classics; while Shaw University has a scientific course of 4 years, in 
which the studies of the first 3 years are the same as in the normal course, 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—T wo universities for the education of the colored people provide the 
chief theological training of the State. Biddle University, under the care of the Pres- 
pyterian Board of Missions for the Freedmen, has a theological course of 3 years, re-

quiring for admission graduation from some college or its equivalent. The theologi- 
cal department of Shaw University, Raleigh (Baptist), has a regular course of 2 years 
for students who have graduated from the academical department and an English 
course for those who have not completed their literary studies. 
For statistics of these departments reporting in 1883-84, see Table XI of the ap- 
pendix, and for a summary of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.—The law department of the State university has a plan of study comprisin, 
the course prescribed by the supreme court of the State for licence to practise an 
another for those who wish to compete for the degree of LL. B. The former appears 
to be of 1 year; the other, of 2 years. 
Medical.--This is one of the few. States in which there is no medical college for 
whites. The medical department of tho State university gives instruction in a 2-year 
course, but does not now grant degrees, there being a State board of examiners, to 
enon all applicants for licence to practise medicine or surgery in the State must ap- 
ply. The medical department of Shaw University, opened in 1882, for the training of 
colored physicians, offers a 3-year course, of 5 months each year. For needy and de- 
serving students there are scholarships of from $30 to $60. The 2 large buildings 
erected, 1 on a site given by the State, are commodious and afford facilities for a full 
medical course. 
Pharmacy.—The course in pharmacy offered by the State university extends over 2 
sessions, of 5 months each. Students who attend the exercises of these sessions and 
pass a final examination on all the studies of the course receive certificates of gradu-

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
From the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Raleigh, no report 
later than the one for 1881-’82 has been received. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Orphan Asylum at Oxford, organized and managed by the State Grand pode 
of Masons primarily for the orphans of Masons, receives also promising orphans of a. 
classes between the ages of 8 and 12. They are discharged when 14 to 16, or earlier 
if adopted, found incorrigible, or incapable. The boys and girls occupy separate 
buildings and have separate schools; out of school the girls are trained in general 
housework, in sewing, and in making and mending clothes for themselves and the 
boys. The boys assist in preparing fuel, caring for the stock, and cultivating the 
soil. Its annual income is $5,000 from the State, $2,000 from the Grand Lodge, and 
contributions from lodges, churches, benevolent societies, and individuals, amounting 
in 1883~64 to $14,309. Total number of orphans during the year, 192; number at date 
of report, 125. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The industrial department of Shaw University has a class of young men receiving 
instruction in carpentry and furniture making, while the young women who board in 
the institution receive instruction in dressmaking and domestic arts. Skilled teach- 
ers have been provided in these departments of industry, 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Of the 3 educational journals in the State only 1 gives any account of the meetin; 
of this body in July, 1884, and this account is so brief that it is here given psibabliahad 
in the North Carolina Teacher of August, 1884: 
“The State Association of County Superintendents met at Chapel Hill July 2, 1884, 
There were but few present. No officers were elected for the ensuing year and but 2 
of the topics assigned in the program for the meeting were presented. Superin- 
tendent A. §. Smith read the answers from superintendents and other educators to 
the circular letter sent out by order of the last meeting. He then read a paper on the 
‘School law: its defects and remedies.’ Superintendent Isham Royal followed with a 
paper on ‘Schoolorganization.’ These subjects were discussed by the superintendents 
and visitors present. A committee was appointed to issue a circular to the county 
superintendents of the State urging them to attend a meeting to be called by the 
president. The association adjourned to meet at Raleigh at the call of the president.”

  NORTH CAROLINA, 211 
NORTH CAROLINA TEACHERS’ ASSEMBLY. 
This body takes the place of the North Carolina Teachers’ Convention and is in- 
tended to be permanently located at some beautiful and healthful mountain spot, 
with commodious buildings for its use, when its grounds will become the educational 
capital of the State, after the style of the Chautauqua of the North. 
ts first meeting was held at Haywood White Sulphur Springs, near Waynesville, 
June 18-28, 1884, there being present on the first day over 300 teachers and friends of 
education, which number was largely increased during the session. On the firstday a 
permanent organization was effected, with choice of John J. Fray as president, who, 
on taking the chair, appointed committees on a constitution and program. The 
order of exercises adopted was one session a day from 10 A.M. to 1 P. M., with 2 topics 
for each session, the afternoons to be given to rest, recreation, and sightseeing and 
the evenings to musical and literary exercises. 
On the second day began the earnest work of the session, the discussion of topics, 
the first one being ‘‘ How to awaken interest in the work of the schools,” followed 
by ‘‘ How to gain and hold the attention of pupils;” on the third day, ‘‘ How to in- 
terest parents” and ‘‘The nature and value of county supervision of schools,” the 
latter said to have been thoroughly handled by Mr. A.R. Johnson, superintendent of 
McDowell County, ‘The art of questioning” was the first subject for discussion on 
the sixth day, followed by ‘‘The best method of teaching history,” an easy and 
satisfactory method being explained by Mr. E. C. Branson. At this stage of the 
proceedings a letter was received from Mrs. Stringfield, owner of the sulphur 
springs, offering the grounds of the springs and other liberal inducements for the 
location of the annual sessions of the association. A committee was appointed to 
consider the offer and report to the next annual meeting. Miss T. Pescud then read 
an essay on ‘‘The new education,” after which Dr. George Thomas, chairman of the 
board of education of Detroit, congratulated the teachers on the admirable work 
they were doing at this meeting. Onthe seventh day, ‘‘ Grading of country schools” 
was discussed by Hon. Alexander McIver, former State superintendent, and was con- 
tinued by Professor Morson, who said that one of the greatest difficulties in the way of 
grading country schools was the effort to teach too much. Only the plain, practical 
branches should be taught, and the very best efforts must be given to this line of in- 
struction, The elementary branches are enough in such cases. On the eighth day 
Miss Mary R. Goodloe read an essay on ‘‘The teacher and his methods.” The regular 
topics for the day, “‘The new education” and ‘‘ Physical training,” were then dis- 
cussed, the latter by Mr. W. H. Smith. In the afternoon Miss Florence Slater, teacher 
of calisthenics in St. Mary’s School, Raleigh, entertained the assembly with an hour of 
drill in calisthenic exercises, which appears to have concluded the exercises. 
The North Carolina Teacher, speaking of this first session, says that it was a com- 
plete success and is conceded to have been the most important educational Sipe Hie 
ever held in the State. The attendance was very large, representing 65 counties an 
10 States, made up from the cream of the profession in nearly all the leading schools 
and colleges in the State. The assembly, now thoroughly organized, with grounds 
and money pledged for its purposes, is to raise an ample fund to secure the most able 
teachers in the Union. 
STATE COLORED TEACHERS’ CONVENTION. 
The State Colored Teachers’ Convention held its second annual meeting at Raleigh 
November 12-14, 1884. The work of the association is said to have been good and 
practical, and the essays read are reported to have showed considerable thought and 
information, The teachers are using every available means to make themselves more 
proficient, and the prospect of success seems promising.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The above summary, as may be seen, indicates a generally progressive condition of 
public school affairs. With an increase in 1883~84 of over 14,000 enumetated youth, 
7,264 more appear as enrolled in public schools and 10,261 more were in average 
daily attendance; the per cent. of school age enrolled exceeded 70, although this age 
includes all unmarried youth 6 to 21. Twenty-five per cent. of these youth of school 
age enumerated were, it should be remarked, between 16 and 21, of which portion 
over 31 per cent. were enrolled in the public schools. Leaving these older youth out 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
OHIO. : 213 
of the account, it appears that over 83 per cent. of the children 6 to 16 were enrolled 
for public school instruction. The large decrease of 20,513 attending private schools 
is not explained. The average school term for the State was 4 days longer than the 
preceding year; more teachers were permanently employed; the whole expenditure 
for schools was considerably increased. School rooms were more numerous by 405 in 
1883~84, and the cost of school-houses built that year was much less, as was the val- 
uation of all school property. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For general supervision of the public schools there is a State commissioner elected triennially by the people. Under him are boards of education for city and village districts, township and special districts, and joint subdistricts. To test the qualifi- cations of teachers, there are boards of examiners for the State, for counties, and for 
cities and villages. Each board of education must establish a sufficient number of schools for the free education of all youth of school age within the district under its control, and, if deemed necessary, may open one or more high schools. Each town- 
ship board must establish at least one school in every subdistrict under its control. 
District boards may, if thought best for the interests of the district, establish sepa- 
rate schools for colored children. In cities and villages such boards may provide 
evening schools and establish schools in children’s homes, orphan asylums, and county 
infirmaries, expending on these the full share of public moneys due all such children 
of school age, which must be applied exclusively to the payment of teachers. All 
children between the ages of 8 and 14 must attend the public schools for at least 12 
weeks in each school year, 6 of which weeks must be consecutive, unless the child’s 
health, the needs of an indigent relative, or the distance (2 miles or more) from the 4 
nearest school makes such attendance inexpedient or unless rendered unnecessary 
by the child’s previous acquirements or by the fact that its instruction is otherwise 
provided for. The employment of any child less than 14 years, under control of a 
parent or guardian and not dependent on its own resources, is prohibited unless the 
child has attended school for at least 12 weeks; nor may it then be employed for 
more than 40 weeks. Each board determines the text books to be used and the studies 
to bé pursued, text books not to be changed for 3 years without the consent of three- 
fourths of the members of the board. The studies must be in English, unless German 
be demanded by 75 freeholders, who represent at least 40 pupils entitled to attend such 
schools. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The public schools are sustained from the proceeds of an annual tax, the amount 
to be fixed by the legislature; when not so fixed, it is 1 mill on $1 of all taxable 
property. They receive also 6 per cent. interest on an irreducible common school fund 
and the income from local taxation. State funds, to be used only in the payment of 
teachers, are apportioned by the State auditor to the several counties and districts ac- 
cording to the latest enumeration of youth therein. The funds for continuing schools, 
for providing school-houses and sites, and all other contingent school expenses must 
be raised by a district tax not to exceed 7 mills on $1. In Cincinnati the limit is 5. 
mills and in Cleveland 4} mills. The law allows an appropriation to be made from 
the contingent fund in any district for libraries. In city districts a tax of one-tenth 
of a mill on the $1 of taxable property at its assessed valuation may be levied for 
this purpose, and in the city of Cleveland it may be two-and-one-half-tenths of a mill 
on $1. ‘ 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants have boards of education of 1 or 2 members 
for each ward, while cities with less than 10,000 inhabitants and villages usually have 
boards of 3 or 6 members; but a majority of the board may decide that its number 
shall correspond with that of the wards of the city, one-third being changed annually 
in either case. Cincinnati has a board consisting of 12 members at large and 25 
oehors representing as many wards and Cleveland has a board of 18 members, 1 for 
each ward,

Akron in 1882~83 reported 12 school-houses, containing 47 rooms, with 3,325 sittings 
for study, less than the number of pupils enrolled but more than enough for the average 
attendance, Additional buildings were in course of erection, including a high school 
building, and the following year 383 more sittings were reported. The public schools 
were taught 194 days during 1882~83; the following year, 193 days. Private and 
church aeoaia enrolled about 788 pupils in 1883 and 860 in 1884. 
Chillicothe in 1883-84 reported primary, grammar, and high schools, tanght 190 days 
in 5 buildings, valued, with other school property, at $168,000. Besides the enrol- 
men in pate schools above reported, 3 private schools had an estimated attendance 
of 325 pupils. 
Cincinnati showed in 1882~83 an Sepa decrease of 8,763 in school youth, yet en- 
rolled 93 more than in 1881~’82 and had 750 more in average attendance. School ex- 
penditures were materially reduced. In 188384 it again advanced inschool population, 
enrolment, and average attendance, without eadk int its limit of 1881~82 in expen- 
diture for schools. It reported public schools taught 200 days in 49 school buildings, 
with 636 rooms for study, 31 for recitation, and 35,953 sittings, all school property 
being valued at $2,100,000. The city school system includes, su' stantially as before, 
primary, intermediate, grammar, high, evening, and deaf-mute schools, with instruc- 
tion in, musio,.drawing, German, and penm ip, for which latter.branches special

   teachers are employed. Tho number studying German in the ae intermediate, 
and high schools in 1882-83 was 17,770, or, exclusive of those in colored schools, over 
53 per cent. of the whole number enrolled; in 1883-'@4 it was over 18,000. The school 
age for the city, as for the State at large, is 6 to 21, but the superintendent takes 6 to 
14 as the average age within which the public school course below the high school is 
completed, and practically the time for such completion in most cit The actual 
number attending the public schools between these ages in 1882~’83 he says was 
31,237; the estimated number in church schools, 13,590; in private schools, 700; in 
charitable and reformatory schools, 50. This makes a total of 46,027 between 6 
and 14 years of age attending school, and leaves only 5,647 of such age not apparently 
in any school. i 
The appropriation for the evening schools was in this year so small thatthey had to 
be closed in the middle of the term, and consequently no pupils graduated from the 
night high school. The enrolment in the night high school was 721; in the district 
evening schools, 2,636; -total, 3,357.. Average number of teachers, 72. The studies 
in the night high school were of fairly high grade; in the others, the common 
branches. 
Cleveland reported a decrease in the school census of 1883, but the superintendent 
says it is manifest that enumerators have done their work carelessly, and states, for 
example, that in the twelfth ward there were more children attending school than 
ever before, but according to the census the youth enumerated in that ward were 
fewer by 1,500 than the year before. He says that while 21 years is the maximum 
legal school age, 16 years is the maximum practical age, a fact that is recognized by 
the law, as it requires those who are more than 16 and less than 21 to be enumerated. 
separately. There were only 396 pupils in the public schools during the year who 
exceeded the age of 16, and of these all but 56 were in the high and training schools. 
Church schools had 10,456 pupils and private schools, 1,510. The public schools 
are primary, grammar, high, and normal. About one-half of all the pupils in 
the public schools studied German, a monthly average of 9,593, of which number 
6,325 were of German parentage. Tho two high schools numbered 1,063 pupils and 
graduated 83. Lots for the erection of school-houses were purchased during the year 
at a cost of $32,171. The board also contracted for and began to erect 7 buildings, 
the total contract price of which was $266,990, These buildings, to be ready September 
1, 1884, although furnishing 56 additional rooms, would not entirely supply the need 
for additional accommodations. 
Columbus reported in 1883~84 an increase of 618 pupils in public schools over the 
Hreceaing year. The schools, primary, grammar, high, and normal, were taught 191 
ays in 27 buildings, with accommodations for 8,975 pupils. One more building was 
reported, and 561 more sittings for study. Special teachers of music and drawing 
‘were employed and these studies were pursued throughout the entire school course. 
In the high school Latin and German were among the studies pursued and Greek was 
elective. School property was valued at $852,394, Estimated enrolment in private 
and church schools, 1,820. 
Special attention is given to German during 7 years and music is taught through- 
out the entire course, In the evening schools were enrolled 611 pupils, with an ay- 
erage attendance of 297. There were 52 boys and 130 girls in the free hand drawing 
department and 206 boys in the industrial drawing school, about the same as during 
the previous year. The number in the school for common branches inereased, while 
in the free hand drawing school it fell off nearly one-half. 
Dayton for 1882~83 reported an increase in enrolment and a falling off of 2 per 
cent. in average daily attendance. The enrolment in the day schools was 52.2 per 
cent. of the youth of school age and 68.2 per cent. of the youth 6-16 years of age. 
According to the estimate of the city superintendent, there were enrolled in private 
and church schools 1,800 pupils, giving a total in all the day schools of 8,329, or 66.5 
er cent. of the school census. As the pupils 16 to 21 in public schools numbered only 
0, it was estimated that about 84 per cent. of the children between 6 and 16 were 
enrolled in the day schools. The city school system includes primary, intermediate, 
grammar, high, normal, and evening schools. 
Fremont, in a return for 1883~84, reports public schools taught 185 days in 8 school 
buildings containing 10 rooms, with 1,000 sittings, all school property valued at 
$50,000, a slight increase in public school enrolment and average attendance, and 400 
attending private and church schools, The number 6 to 16 enrolled in public schools 
was 1,448; over 16 years, only 517. Particular attention was paid to music and pen- 
manship and the work in the German department was the most satisfactory that 
had ever been done in the schools, about 120 pupils being engaged in the study. 
Hamilion in 1883~84 had 5 school buildings, with 37 rooms and 2,116 sittings, 
all school property being valued at $135,000, While the number of youth of school a, 
reported remained the same, thére was an increase in enrolment and average dai X 
attendance in public schools, These were classed as primary, grammar, and high...

special teacher of music was employed. The estimated enrolment in private and 
church schools was 1,100. 
The statistics from Ironton show an increase in 1883-84 in the number of youth of 
school age, the number enrolled in public schools, and the average daily attendance. 
Besides the number in public schools, there was an estimated attendance on private 
and parochial schools of 200, 
Lima in 1883~84 reported public schools taught 188 days in 3 buildings, containing 
29 rooms, with 2,010 sittings; school property valued at $91,200; 2,346 youth 6 to 16, 
of which number 1,776 were enrolled in the public schools; and 777 youth over 16, 
ae spore only 83 were enrolled. The schools were classed as primary, grammar, and 
igh. : 
Newark for 188283 showed a decrease in school census and an increase in enrol- 
ment, with the same number in average daily attendance. There were 300 in private 
and church schools, leaving 1,022 not attending any school. The public schools were 
tanght 184 days in 6 buildings, containing 41 rooms, with accommodations for 1,980 
pupils, school property being valued at $80,500. Special teachers of German and pen- 
manship were employed. 
Portsmouth for 1883~84 reported 2,091 youth 6 to 16 in the public schools and only 
95 over 16. The schools were taught 190 days in 6 buildings, with 43 rooms, valued, 
with all school property, at $200,000. The high school occupied 4 rooms and en- 
rolled 43 boys and 96 girls, with an average daily attendance of 109. No information 
is given as to private schools.

study, valued, with all school property, at $168,000, The schools were classed as 
primary, grammar, and high, and were taught 193 days in the year. German formed 
a part of the course of study; penmanship and drawing were taught throughout the 
entire school system, but no special teachers of these branches were employed. The 
estimated enrolment in private and church schools for the year was 1,000, which 
number, added to the enrolment in public schools, gives a total of 3,685 under in- 
struction, leaving 1,697 youth of school age not attending any school, a very large 
majority of them, however, being over 16 years of age. 
Springfield reported in 1883~84 an increase during 2 years of 1,347 in youth of school 
age, of 1,008 in enrolment, and of 789 in daily attendance. There were 1,200 pupils 
in private and church schools, making a total of 5,175 youth under instruction and 
leaving 3,407 not attending any school, The public schools—primary, grammar, and 
high— were taught 180 days. Three special teachers of music, drawing, and penman- 
ship were employed. There were 13 school buildings, with 80 rooms and 4,383 sit-

a year before date of the report for 1883-84. A special teacher of German was employed. 
Two 8-room school-houses were being built, to be completed by July, 1884, which, it 
was expected, would atford nearly sufficient accommodations for all the children. 
Tifin in 1883-84 had 5 school buildings, with 26 rooms and 1,460 sittings for study, 
valued, with allother school property, at $90,000. ‘The summaries show a slight fall- 
ing off during the year in school population, enrolment, and average attendance. 
The schools were classed as high, grammar, and primary, and were taught 186 days, 
1 special teacher of music being employed. 
Toledo for 1882~83 reported an increase in public school enrolment and in average 
daily attendance. The schools are divided into 5 departments, primary, secondary,

of the high schools of Toledo. The teaching force of the city was the same as the 
previous year, 4 special teachers of French, German, music, and drawing being in- 
cluded. The schools were eenght in 21 buildings, with 118 rooms for study. There 
were five new buildings erected during the year, at a cost of $23,682, and improve-

CITY NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State still makes no provision for the education of teachers, but normal train- 
ing is included in the public sclool systems of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Day- 
ton, Steubenville, and other cities. 
The Cincinnati Normal School presents a 1-year course partly devoted to the theory of 
teaching and partly to its practice. For admission persons must be over 17 years of 
age and pass a satisfactory examination. To have free tuition, students must be resi- 
dents of the city. There are both English and German classes. Students in 1882~83, 
58, 14 of them German, 45from the high schools. Of 63 students in 1883~84, 37 were 
graduates of the city high schools. Whole number of normal graduates since the or- 
ganization of the school in 1868, 725. 
The Cleveland Training School gives instruction to graduates from the public school 
course, qualifying them for teaching. In 1882~’83 there were 41 such students, 37 of 
whom were graduated, making 282 since organization in 1875, Of this number 250 
had been employed as teachers and 175 were still teaching. 
The Columbus Training School, established in 1482, gives a course in theory and 
practice covering a schooi year and including the study of mental science, history of 
education, and school government. Resident graduates of the high school or resi- 
dents of like qualifications who are at least 17 years of age and agree to teach in the 
public schools of Columbus for 3 consecutive years, if their services are required, 
may be admitted free. : 
The Dayton Normal School graduated 9 young women in 1882-83, of whom 7 en- 
gaged in teaching, making a total of 157 graduates since the opening of the school. 
A normal class at Steubenville, apparently established in 1882, was continued in 
1883~84, having met the anticipations of its most sanguine friends. The course in- 
cludes mental philosophy; theory, principles, and history of education; methods of 
instruction; and school economy. The practice department consists of 2 roems in 
charge or a training teacher, children in these rooms being taught in turn by the nor- 
mal pupils. 
Respecting the normal class formerly noticed at Toledo, there is no information. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING, 
The private normal schools reporting are the Northwestern Ohio Normal, Ada, 
having a 4-year course of study and reporting 1,195 normal students in 18&3~84, of 
whom 121 were graduated; Ashland College Normal, having a 4-year course, with 
80 normal students; Fayette Normal, having a 4-year course, with 160 normal students 
and graduating 5; National Normal University, Lebanon, with courses of 2 and 3 years, 
and 1,656 students under normal instruction, of whom 98 were graduated; Northeast- 
ern Ohio Normal School, Canfield, with classical, scientific, and normal courses, the 
last enrolling 132 students; also the normal department of Ohio Wesleyan University, 
Delaware; the Western Reserve Normal School, Milan; Teachers’ Seminary, Wood- 
alles and Northern Ohio Normal College, Mansfield, formerly Mansfield Normal 
‘ollege. 
Bon! statistics of these and other normal schools reporting, see Table III of the ap- 
pendix, and for a summary, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
An institute may be held in any county if at least 30 resident common school teach- 
ers declare their intention to attend. Such institutes must be held not less than 4 
days and a report of proceedings must be made to the commissioner of common 
schools within 30 days. Fees of 50 cents from each applicant for examination as a 
teacher are applied to the support of institutes. City districts, if they prefer, may 
retain in their own treasuries the fees collected, and with the amount hold a city 
district institute. Teachers of common schools in the county in which an institute 
is held may dismiss their schools to attend such institute, but union and graded 
schools may not be thus dismissed unless all the teachers are willing. 
Institutes were held during 1883~84 in all the counties but one, at a cost of $22,147, 
the sessions lasting from 4 to 20 days and having an aggregate attendance of 12,270, 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The Ohio Educational Monthly, published now at Akron, is the oldest school 
journal in the State and one of the oldest in the United States, being in its thirty- 
third volume in 1884. It has been for many years the organ of the State Teachers’ 
Association. 
The National Normal Exponent, published mainly in the interest of the National 
Nomual iaigaratty at Lebanon, appears monthly at Cincinnati and was in its eighth 
volume in .

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The high school statistics for 1883-84 show an enrolment of 2,256 pupils in town- 
ship high schools and 29,697 in city, village, and special district high schools, an in- 
crease of 3,343 over the preceding year. Of this number 13,985 were between the 
Base of 16 and 21 years. The average daily attendance of pupils in the township 
schools was 1,587, and in those of city, village, and special districts, 21,458, an in- 
crease of 2,460. The whole number of teachers in these schools was 600 men and 286 
women, an increase of 65 men and 28 women. The average monthly salary of men 
in township high schools was increased from $54 to $62; that of women was reduced 
from $37 to $31. In city, village, and special district high schools the pay of men 
was increased from $69 to $70, while that of women was reduced from $59 to $57. The 
average number of weeks the high schools were in session in township districts was 
26; in city, village, and special districts, 35. The high schools occupied 677 rooms 
during the year, an increase of 64,

‘For statistics of private academic schools, preparatory schools, or preparatory de- 
partments of ee ta see Tables VI, VII, and IX, and for business colleges, Table IV 
of the appendix; for summaries of the same, corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
. SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Ohio State University, founded on the congressional land grant of July, 1862, 
for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, provides 3 general courses of 
study, for the degrees of bachelor of arts, philosophy, and science, besides 4 special 
courses leading to the degrees of civil, mining, and mechanical engineer and bachelor 
of agriculture. The trustees in 1884 reported the university to be in a condition of 
healthy growth, and facilities for scientific and practical instruction were constantly 
increasing. During the year the various laboratories had received important addi- 
tions, the library was enlarged, a new horticultural hall was completed, and the grounds 
were much improved. Young women are admitted on equal terms with men. 
Of 34 colleges and universities, including the above, reporting to this Office for 
1883 or 1884, all but 8 were open to both sexes; all but 1, the University of Cincin- 
nati, offered preparatory training; all had classical courses of 4 years; nearly all, 
scientific courses, also of 4 years. Business instruction was provided oy 9, and prep- 
aration for teaching, to a greater or less extent, by 17. Nearly all included some of 
the modern languages in their curricula and more than half the number gave in- 
struction in music. Theological or biblical courses were offered by 13 and medical 
courses by 2. 
The State superintendent, in his report for 1883~84, gives statistics of 28 of these 
colleges, including National Normal University, showing an attendance in collegiate 
departments of 3,139 students (775 of them young women), of whom 930 were can- 
didates for the degree of B. A., 432 for that of B. s., and 334 for that of PH. B.; a total 
expenditure for the year of $430,244, of which $141,283 were received from students; 
and property valued at $6,823,595. 
Eleven of the above institutions report a total of $184,496 received during the year, 
most of it in cash, in gifts, or in bequests from friends. Of this amount, Buchtel Col- 
lege, Akron, received over $8,000; Baldwin University, Berea, $2,000 (besides 1,000 
acres of land, not included in the above total); Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, 
$22,000; Adelbert College, Cleveland, $500; Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware. 
$35,000 in cash and land, part of it for endowment of a professorship of. experimental 
and practical religion ; Mt. Union College, $3,000 ; Muskingum College, New Concord, 
about $1,000; Wittenberg College, Springfield, $40,000 for a new building; Otterbein 
University, Westerville, $35,000 to pay indebtedness and make improvements; Uni- 
versity of Wooster, about $7,800 to increase endowment, and Oberlin College $30,000, 
of which $6,000 were from Mr. David Whitcomb, of Worcester, Mass., to found schol- 
arships for worthy and self supporting young women. Other bequests were received 
by Oberlin recently, but it does not clearly appear from the report that they belonged 
to the year 1883-84, 
The courses of study in Hiram College were revised during 1882~83 and made to 
accord with those prescribed by the Ohio College Association; the scientific course 
was discontinued and the former Latin-scientific course became a philosophital course.

INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides the 26 institutions noted above which admit both sexes,.13 colleges and 
seminaries for young women report either for 1883 or 1884, of which 6 were authorized. 
by law to confer collegiate degrees. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix, 
and fora summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Scientific instruction is given in general scientific courses of study provided by 
nearly all the colleges of the State, including the State university; in the 4 technical 
courses of the university, and in the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, Cincinnati. 
In the 4 technical courses of the State university students find opportunity to pursue 
studies in agriculture, veterinary science, horticulture, botany, civil and mechanical 
engineering, mining, and metallurgy, besides mathematics, drawing, German, French, 
and Latin. In recognition of its obligations to the agricultural interests of the State, 
the university has fixed its standard of admission so that students may enter from the 
better classes of common schools; it has provided thorongh instruction in the branches 
of science on which agriculture depends, has established professorships of theoretical 
and applied agriculture and of horticulture and botany, and has instituted free courses 
of agricultural lectures for the farmers of the State. 
The Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, an evening school comprising in its curriculum 
mechanical, architectural, and artistic departments, has increased its number of ses- 
sions from 2 to 5 evenings in the week, and is thus able to give instruction to a much 
larger number than formerly, the enrolment in 1883~’84 reaching 428 against 364 the 
year previous. . 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given in regular courses by 13 institutions, some of them 
independent seminaries and others departments of colleges and universities; while a 
number of other colleges provide facilities for biblical study during the college course. 
For statistics of these schools, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a summary of 
their statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction is provided in the Law School of the Cincinnati College, an insti- 
tution organized in 1833 and meant to be a college of general academic instruction, 
but which, not having means to support a full college course, has limited its work to 
the law department. A course of 2 years, extending over 30 weeks each, is provided 
and diplomas are granted only after examination by a committee BOR OUIGe by the 
supreme court of Ohio. The school has a carefully selected law hbrary of 3,000 
volumes, to which additions are made each year from an annual appropriation of $1,500 
for the purpose. For statistics, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Medical training was given in 1883~’84 in 15 bona fide schools of medicine, of which 
10 were “regular,” 2 homeopathic, and 2 eclectic, as well as in one institution not rec- 
ognized by the Illinois State board of health. The following are the ‘‘regular” insti- 
tutions reporting: Medical College of Ohio, Cincinnati; medical department of 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland; Starling Medical College, Columbus; Cin- 
cinnati College of Medicine and Surgery; Miami Medical College, Cincinnati; medi- 
cal department of the University of Wooster, Cleveland ; Columbus Medical College; 
Toledo Medical College, and Northwestern Ohio Medical College, Toledo, The last 
two were reorganized in 1883; all the above bat one (the Starling Medical College) 
require an examination for admission of applicants not graduates of college or some 
other approved literary institution; all make for graduation the requirement of 3 
years of medical study, attendance on two annual lecture courses, the length of lect- 
ure term ranging from 5 to 6 months; 8 advise their students to take a regular 
raded course of three years; 1, the medical department of the University of 
Ryoseter: offers a graded course of 2 years, the Medical College of Ohio retaining 
the old 3-year course. I 
The two homeopathic institutions, the Homeopathic Hospital College, Cleveland, 
and Pulte Medical College, Cincinnati, require an examination for admission of all 
applicants who cannot prove.their fitness to engage in medical study by showing a 
diploma from some literary institution, and require for graduation 3 years’ study of 
medicine, including attendance on 2 lecture terms, the latter lasting 6 months in the

case of the first named and 5 months and 9 days in the last. Both recommend a 
38-year graded course. 
The Eclectic Medical Institute and the American Eclectic Medical College, both at 
Cincinnati, present the usual course of 3 years, including attendance on 2 lecture 
terms, these terms extending over 20 weeks in the case of the first named and only 
about 18 in the other, which lacks the recognition of the Illinois board of health. 
The first mentioned advises a graded course of 3 years and offers in a preliminary 
course of lectures opportunity for a review in all the branches of a good English 
education, although it is not distinctly stated that this knowledge is required for 
admission; the American Eclectic requires an examination of all not graduates of 
some approved literary institution. 
For statistics of medical colleges reporting, see Table XIII of the appendix, and for 
a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
TRAINING IN MUSIC. 
The Cincinnati College of Music makes no special report to this Bureau for 1883 or 
1884, but is understood to have continued in those years both its academic depart- 
ment and general music school, the former for those who desire to graduate or to pur- 
sue a definite course of study for some time, the latter for either general or special 
instruction in musical science and practice. A school of dramatic art is reported to 
have been also in contemplation. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Columbus (founded 1828), 
reported 505 different pupils in 1883, with an average daily attendance of 420. In 
1884 there were 476, of whom 216 were girls. The school has 4 departments, academic, 
grammar, primary, and articulation, all under 25 instructors. Besides training in 
literature there is instruction in book-binding, carpentry, printing, and shoemaking. 
The general length of term is7 years; the utmost limit of it,10 years. Pupils must be 
residents of the State, be between the ages of 8 and 21, of good moral character, and 
of sound intellect. Total number who have received instruction since organization, 
2,068; volumes in library, 2,000. The institution owns 10 acres of land, valued, with 
hea at $750,000. State appropriation for the year, $100,675; expenditure, 
95,301. 
The Cincinnati Day School for Deaf-Mutes, in charge of the city board of education, 
had in 1882~83 an enrolment of 26 and an average attendance of 23; in 188384, an 
enrolment of 31, with an average attendance of 28, under 2 instructors. The full course 
covers 7 years, 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Blind, Columbus, had in 1883~84 an en- 
rolment of 190 pupils. Instruction is given in common and higher English branches, 
in Latin, and in instrumental music. In the industrial department there is training 
in piano tuning, chair caning, broom making, séwing, knitting, and beadwork. This 
department in 1882-83 made 455 dozen brooms, cane seated 284 chairs, and did about 
two hundred dollars’ worth of piano tuning, besides other work. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Ohio Institution for the Feeble-Minded, Columbus, in 1882~83 had 519 inmates, 
28 officers and teachers, and 85 employés. In addition to learning common school 
studies, the boys keep up the current work of the farm, garden, and grounds. The 
girls are taught laundry work, sewing, and general housework. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Boys’ Reform School, located on a farm of 1,210 acres, near Lancaster, under- 
takes the educational, moral, and industrial training of those committed to it. One 
half of each day is devoted to school work; the remainder, to industrial training and 
recreation. Instruction is given in vocal and instrumental music by experienced 
teachers. Great pains are taken to make all the instruction thorough and practical, 
so that pupils going out may enter school without hindrance or be fitted for self sup- 
port. The institution was organized in 1858, since which time there had been 3,717 
received up to 1883, of whom 460 remained. Number committed during the year, 178, 
the youngest 10 years of age and the oldest 19. Of these, 108 were white Americans, 
23 poor and the remaining 47 foreigners.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Ohio Teachers’ Association held its thirty-fourth annual meeting at Chautauqua, 
N.Y., July 3-5, 1883. The superintendents’ section was called together by Superin- 
tendent R. McMillen. The president of the section, J. W. Dowd, of Toledo, delivered 
his inaugural address, after which papers were presented on ‘The legitimate duties 
of the school superintendent” and ‘‘ The mission of the public school.” 
The general association was convened the second day, Chairman McMillen presiding. 
Mx. George W. Walker, president of the general association, in his inaugural address, 
called upon the officers and teachers to give more attention to health in the public 
schools, and said physiology and hygiene should constitute a part of every teacher's 
course, and that he should be required to pass an examination in these subjects. Among 
the matters discussed were the question whether the minimum of school age should 
be changed; whether there should be training schools for villages and townships; 
whether there is ‘‘a higher education,” and “ How far can our school system be called 
amach ine?” The committee on a course of reading for teachers recommended a 4-year 
course, and a resolution was adopted that the association take steps to inaugurate 
among the teachers of Ohio an organization for reading and study, to be known as 
the Ohio Teachers’ Reading Circle, said circle to be under the management of the 
State Teachers’ Association. A committee chosen for the purpose reported resolutions 
recommending the association to choose a board of control consisting of 8 members, 
who should select a course of professional and literary reading, issue certificates of 
progress, and grant diplomas at the completion of the course. The resolutions were 
adopted and the president appointed the board, after which the association ad- 
journed. 
The thirty-fifth annual session of the association, held at Lakeside, Ohio, July 1-3, 
1884, was one of the most successful meetings in its history. The attendance was not 
less than 500, membership tickets numbexing 315. The superintendents’ section was 
presided over by Superintendent R. McMillen, chairman of the executive committee. 
President Andrews delivered an inaugural address and the reading of papers on 
“How well is the average graduate prepared for life?” and ‘‘The old and new in 
education” followed. 
In the general association President E. ’. Moulton delivered the inaugural address. 
Among the subjects presented by others were ‘‘ Every day difficulties in the school 
room,” “The practical realization of the great end of education,” ‘‘ Ethics in the school 
room,” ‘Music in the public schools,” and ‘‘The value of literary culture to the 
teacher.” E. A. Jones, secretary of the board of control of the Ohio Teachers’ Read- 
ing Circle, stated the general object and special aims of the circle, as well as its plan 
of work: He reported over 2,000 members, the greater part of whom had completed 
the course prescribed for the first year. 3

The statistics as presented for the two years embraced in the State rept show a 
large and well proportioned increase throughout, although there was a falling off in 
the school term and in expenditure in 188384. Against an increase of only 4,791 in 
school youth in 1883~84 enrolment increased by 5,973, the per cent. of enrolment
-P-A-G-E-495
  OREGON. — 223 
to school youth, 58.43, being a gain of 4.60. In average daily attendance the gain 
was greater, the increase here being 12,915, making the per cent. of attendance to 
enrolment 91.55, a gain of 20.03. The shadow across this picture of prosperity is the 
24,372 youth of school age not in any school, but this figure is not large, due regard 
being had to the wide range of school age and the newly settled character of the State. 
To supply facilities for schooling there were added 75 new districts, 54 school build- 
ings, 46 male and 327 female teachers, $631,096 of school property, and $167,478 to the 
State school fund. 
The State superintendent says that the unsatisfactory results of schools planted in 
the remote parts of the State and the migratory character of the inhabitants, who 
move from point to point, have given rise to questions difficult of solution, but of 
great importance to the permanent school patrons and school officers ofremote districts. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
For the general management of public schools there is a State superintendent of 
public instruction, elected quadrennially by the people; this officer, the governor, and 
the secretary of state constitute a State board of education. For counties there are 
county superintendents of common schools, elected biennially by the voters of the 
county ; for districts, boards of 3 directors, chosen by the voters in the district for 3 
years, with annual change of 1, and a district clerk, elected at the same time for 1 
year. 
District school boards receiving State school funds (which are apportioned on the 
basis of children of school age) must make report to their county superintendent by 
the first Monday in March of each year; the county superintendent, on the first Mon- 
day in April, to the State superintendent; and he, biennially to the legislature. Uni- 
formity of text books is secured by the State superintendent, who sends to the county 
superintendents quadrennially a cirenlarnaming the required studies. Each county 
superintendent marks against each study the text book he prefers, and those calied 
for by a majority of the superintendents are selected by the State board and author- 
ized to be used 4 years. Any school district of 10,000 or more inhabitants may 
have one or more of its common schools taught in the German language on the peti- 
tion of 100 qualified voters of the district. Widows with children to educate and 
owning taxable property in the district are entitled to vote at school meetings. Any 
qualified voter, male or female, is eligible to the office of school director. Sixty days 
or 1 school weeks constitute a quarter of a school year; making the full school year 
240 days. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are made free to all youth 4 to 20 years of age in the State 
through the proceeds of a State school fund, escheats and forfeitures, moneys paid for 
exemption from military duty, gifts, devises, and bequests for common school pur- 
poses, property granted to the State with no specified object, a county tax of 4 mills 
on $1, and through a tax which district meetings, legally called, may levy on real and 
personal property in the district. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Any city or incorporated town of 10,000 or more inhabitants may be organized into 
@ district and elect a board of 3 or more directors, who may employ a superintendent, 
hire teachers, prescribe courses of study, improve the grading of schools when neces- 
sary, and create a board of examiners to test the qualifications of those to be employed 
as teachers in said schools. Schools supported by a tax on the district are free to all 
persons 6 to 21 residing therein, and persons from outside may be admitted on such 
terms as the district may direct. 
SCHOOL OFFICERS OF PORTLAND. 
Portland has a board of 5 directors, a school clerk, a city superintendent, and a 
board of examiners. 
STATISTICS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
For 1883~84 the city report shows that in a population of 32,000 there were (includ- 
ing 223 Chinese) 6,523 of school age, for whom there were 71 school rooms. The en- 
rolment, 3,864, was an increase of 381 over the last year, and there was an average 
daily attendance of 2,779. The enrolment was 59.24 per cent. of the school youth, 
and, with 592 in private and charch schools, there were 68.01 per cent. of enumer- 
ated youth in school; while 71.88 per cent. of those enrolled were in average daily 
attendance. The schools were classed as high, grammar, and primary, and wero 
taught by 72 teachers, including the superintendent. An evening schoul, for boys 
who are obliged to work during the day, was open 5 evenings a week for 3 months

included in their report, expended for sites and 3 new school buildings $93,591, of 
which $54,176 were for a brick high school building, the estimated cost of which, 
completed, was $114,176. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
Persons seeking employment in the public schools of the State must have certifi- 
cates of qualification from the State board of education, a county superintendent, or 
a city board of examination. 
Tho State board grants life diplomas, which entitle the holder to teach in any pub- 
lic school in the State during life; State diplomas, which entitle the holder to teach 
for 6 years; first grade State certificates, good in any county for 2 years; and second 
grade, good in any county for 6 months, these certificates being of the same force as 
those granted by the county superintendents. 
Each county superintendent is required to examine, in the branches taught in the 
common schools, all applicants intending to teach in his county. He may issue only 
the 2 grades of certificates just mentioned. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Oregon Normal School, Monmouth, and the Ashland College and Normal School, 
Ashland, organized by the State in 1882, have courses of an covering apparently 3 
years, though this is not made entirely clear at Monmouth, where there is an element- 
ary course of 1 year and a regular course of 2 years, but no positive evidence that the 
two together constitute what is called in the State law ‘‘the required course.” Men 
over 21 and women over 18 years of age, completing this required course in either 
school and passing an examination approved by the State board of education, re- 
ceive a State diploma good for 6 years; and, if these years are spent in successful 
teaching in the State, may have a life diploma from the State board. Theschool at 
Monmouth graduated 1 person in 1882~83 and 9 in 1883~84 ; that at Ashland, appar- 
ently with a 3-year course, expected to graduate a class in 1884~85. 
The University of Oregon, Eugene, continued in 1882~83 and 188384 its 3-year nor- 
mal course of English studies, and for the latter year reports a class of 28 against one 
of 10 the preceding year. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
McMinnville College and Willamette University continue to offer normal instruction in 
well arranged courses, in the former of 2 years, in the latter of 3. Santiam Academy, 
Lebanon, and Wasco Academy, The Dalles, are said to offer like instruction, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The law requires the State superintendent to hold a teachers’ institute in each judi- 
cial district in the State at least once a year, but makes no provision for them beyond 
the necessary travelling expenses of the superintendent. 
During 18#2~83 and 1883~84 one was held in each of the six districts, and in four of 
them two were apparently held. The work was done largely by the teachers of the 
counties where the institutes were held. Teachers in the public schools are required 
to attend at least one teachers’ institute a year, held under authority of law in the 
counties where they reside; and school directors are urged to allow them a reasonable 
time for such attendance without deducting wages or requiring them to make up time 
so spent. For non-attendance without sufficient excuse the county superintendent 
may lower the grade or revoke the certificate of teachers. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
. HIGH SCHOOLS. 
School districts with 1,000 persons of school age are required to maintain a high 
school for at Jeast 6 months of the year, in which shall be taught, in addition to the 
common English branches, such others as the directors of the district may prescribe. 
The State report, as in preceding years, gives no information as to these schools. In 
the city of Portland the high school, in 1883~84, enrolled 189, with an average daily 
attendance of 155. Its courses are English of 3 years and English-Latin and English- 
German of 4 years each. The graduating class numbered 24, The only case of dis- 
cipline was 1 suspension. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools and preparatory departments of colleges 
reporting, see Tables VI and IX of appendix, and summaries of them in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Oregon, Eugene City, still has 2 departments, the collegiate and 
English preparatory. The collegiate has 3 courses, classical and scientific, each of 4 
years, and normal of 3 years, the scientific differing from the classical only in omitting 
Greek and substituting German for it. For those not fully prepared to enter either 
the classical or scientific course, there is a preparatory course of 2 years. The Eng- 
lish preparatory department, with a course of 2 years, supplies the want felt at present 
of a suitable preparatory school in the State, and therefore may not be a permanent 
feature of the university. The report for 1883~84 shows a faculty of 10 instructors, 
213 students, and 25 collegiate graduates for 1883, including 9 normal students; also, 
a library of 1,200 volumes and property valued at $77,000. Women are admitted on 
equal terms with men. ‘i 
The State superintendent says that the general aim of the school, as determined by 
the faculty and the regents, constitutes a fairly comprehensive view of the field of 
letters, the policy being to elevate and enlarge the field of work until the school 
shall afford to young men and women facilities for graduation in any of the learned 
professions, 
Of the other 9 institutions, the Pacific and Willamette Universities and Philomath 
College have ladies’ courses of 3 to 4 years; Ashland, Christian, and Philomath Colleges 
and Willamette University show commercial courses, in the last of 2 years; Corvallis 
College, a school of history and literature; Ashland, a music course of 3 years; Blue 
Mountain and Willamette Universities, and Christian and Philomath Colleges, draw- 
ing and painting. All are open to young women. 
For statistics of the above institutions, see Table IX of the appendix; for summa- 
ries of same, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding,

Willamette University continues its well ore anes woman’s college, with a lady 
dean. For statistics of St. Helen’s Hall for Girls, Portland, see Table VIII of the 
appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Agricultural College of Oregon is organized in the school of agriculture in 
Corvallis College, Corvallis, where instruction is given in analysis of soils, manures, 
modes of drainage, methods of preparing farm buildings, stock raising, fruit culture, 
and, prospectively, the special geology of the State. In the school of engineering 
instruction is also given in drawing, descriptive geometry, and the general principles 
of civil engineering. 
This school, says the State superintendent, is rapidly becoming one of the impor- 
tant agencies of the educational system. The character of the instruction given is 
annually better adapted to the general purposes of an agricultural school, so that 
its students shall become intelligent and progressive farmers, thoroughly prepared 
for the farm, the school room, and the management of farmers’ institutes. A new 
pnilding is to be erected on the agricultural farm. 
For statistics, see Table X of the appendix. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.—The only information at hand in regard to theological instruction in 
the State is the announcement by Christian College that in 1883~84 a department 
of biblical literature and exegesis would be opened, of which opening no report has 
reached this Office. 2 
Legal.—Willamette University, Salem, in 1883-84 presents, for the first time, a 
college of law, with a faculty of 5 professors, a 2-year course of study, and junior 
and senior classes, moot courts, &c. The studies are such as are common in good 
schools of law. The school year begins on the third Wednesday in September and 
ends on the third Wednesday in May, making but one term. No student is admitted 
for less than a year, and he must have studied law a year in some college or under a 
competent instructor. Students who have pursued the full course and passed final 
satisfactory examinations will receive the degree of LL.B. Arrangements will be 
made, it is hoped, for the admission of graduates to the bar of all the courts in the 
State without examination. 
Medical.—The medical department of Willamette University, located at Portland, 
remains the only medical school in the State reporting in 1883-’84. The required 
course is 2 years of 20 weeks each. A 3-year graded course is recommended, but not 
required. Women are admitted on the same conditions as men. For admission, if

years of study, 2 full courses of lectures, a course of practical anatomy, a thesis, and

For statistics, see Table XIII of the appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Oregon School for Deaf-Mutes is under the direction of a board of 9 trustees, 
with 5instructors, The sign system is used, though the lip reading system is to be 
gradually introduced, the experiment for the present being to unite the two. The 
ordinary English branches are taught in school. When organized, the industrial 
department will embrace shoemaking, carpentry, binding, printing, and sewing. 
The school property, including grounds, consists of a home building for the boys, one 
for the girls, and an educational building, the whole being valued at $6,000. For 
statistics, see Table XVIII of the appendix. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
This is but in its infancy in the State. At the biennial session of the legislature 
in 1882, an appropriation of $8,000 was granted for the education of the blind for 
a term of 2 years, to be expended in accordance with an act passed in 1872. Under 
this provision the Oregon School for the Blind, Salem, was organized, April, 1883, 
with a faculty of 4 instructors, since which time it has been in regular session, ex- 
cept the usual vacations. It has adopted the New York point system as best adapted 
to the wants of the school. In the school the branches ordinarily taught in schools 
for the blind are adopted. The industrial department, to be fully organized, only 
needs the required tools and material, and, when furnished, the boys will be taught 
chair bottoming, shoemaking, basket, work, broom making, cooperage, tailoring, 
carpet weaving, and brush making. . The girls are already taught sewing, knitting, 
erotchet work, and the use of the sewing machine, 
For statistics, see Table XIX of the appendix. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
Mr. W. S. Ladd, a banker in Portland, was reported in 1882 as having given to the 
State $20,000 for the erection of a reform school and offering to pay all expenses of 
maintaining it. No further information respecting his gift has reached this Bureau. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
\ OREGON STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its annual session at Salem, June 30 to July 3,1884, State Super- 
intendent McElroy presiding. Besides the members present, of whom 180 were en- 
rolled, there were lecturers and professors of colleges and universities in attendance, 
The session is said to have shown an increasing interest on the part of teachers and 
a fair progress in the educational forces of the State. 
An address from Prof. F, A. E. Starr on ‘‘The teachers’ ambition” opened the ses- 
sion. In this address it was urged that teachers must not doubt as to the ultimate 
results for which they are doing battle: they must be content to be patient toilers 
among the millions of mankind, animated by the consciousness of a noble calling. 
Rev. &. W. Hill followed with a paper on ‘‘ The school in its relation to the future of 
the Republic.” The common school, he said, is the creature of the State, and itis the 
imperative duty of the State to provide such education as will conduce to the welfare 
of the people and the perpetuity of its institutions; and the education given must 
be not in intelligence alone, but in intelligence allied to moral principle. Other topics 
discussed were ‘The relative value of discipline and instruction;” ‘Commercial 
education in public schools;” ‘Order and its relative importance in primary schools; ” 
“Relation of the teacher to the moral training of his school.” As to this last Rev. 
Mr. Spriggs said that there were difficulties connected with the teaching of morals in 
sbhodle} ‘hen morality is mentioned many think of religion, and thus make trouble 
for the teacher. His idea was that moral training must be kept apart from any special 
system of religion. As mutual relations exist in the school, we cannot keep from 
teaching morality, but it must be taught as influencing these mutual relations and 
as a sweetener and purifier of the intercourse of life. President E. C. Anderson, of 
McMinnville College, read a lecture on ‘Home happiness, the prime aim in educa- 
tion,” in which he said that a happy home is a Mecca to which all the weary travel- 
Jers of earth must turn! The comparative merits of mixed and fully graded schools 
were discussed, with some difference of opinion. Mr. H. O. Hutchinson considered 
the graded system a saving of time and trouble, Examination in graded schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-499

means promotion it is an incentive to study, and is favorable to progress as pushing 
toward the higher grades. All common schools may have rules of gradation by lay- 
ing off work regularly for every study. The discussion of the question “‘Are public 
examinations and exhibitions advisable?” developed a difference of opinion, the 
affirmative prevailing. 
“Character the end of education” was next presented in an address by Prof. J. 
L. Gilbert, who said that thoughts are seed germs that produce action; that this 
action blooms into habit and ripens into character, either good or evil. Education 
is the systematic process of training the growing mind toward the pleasure giving 
power of spontaneous, unselfish improvement. ‘ Public schools and their relation to 
colleges” was presented in a lecture by Prof. Joseph Marsh, of the Pacitic University, 
in which he said that the duty of the State to the citizen may be broadly expressed 
in one phrase, ‘‘ the securing of opportunity for right action ;” that the training of the 
mental and moral powers is of far greater value than the amusement of youth or 
the acquisition of wealth; and that position, influence, and honor, to be real and 
permanent, must have a foundation in grand and clear purposes, sound and well de- 
veloped judgment, and well established views and principles, 
“Modern history from a geographical standpoint” was considered; after which 
came the closing lecture, on ‘‘ Elementary instruction in the principles of civil gov- 
ernment,” by President J. F. Ellis, of the Pacific University, in which he said: “ Let 
the common schools but drill our youth faithfully, and we can stand against tho 
world.” Popular government must have a basis of popular intelligence or it cannot 
stand.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The figures in the statistical table show progress in almost every particular. As 
the State takes no census of its school youth, there is nothing to show the increase of 
youth since the United States Census of 1830. There is, however, an increase 
359 in enrolment over 1882~’83, with a more significant increase of 9,410 in aver- 
age daily attendance. There is further indication of progress in the increase of 14 
new school districts, of 377 free schools, of 157 free school-houses, of 450 teachers, of 
$210,278 in expenditure for public schools, and of $1,686,462 in value of school property. 
The improvement in the character of the schools is seen in more graded schools, more 
that teach drawing, vocal music, and the higher branches, and more with uniform 
text books, while improved accommodations are shown by more school-houses rated 
as first class, and better instruction by more teachers who were graduates of normal 
schools and more who have been employed beyond 5 years. The superintendent says 
that every reasonable effort has been made to increase the interest of the people in edu- 
cation, to bring before directors the responsibility of their office, and to induce 
teachers to seek a higher standard of preparation for their profession. But much, 
he thinks, remains to be done, as there are houses in the State used for school 
purposes into which no law should require a well mannered youth to go, and all such 
ought to be removed and better ones substituted for them. More and larger nor- 
mal schools are also needed to supply qualified teachers, while those that exist should 
be so identified with the public school system as to share in the common school fund. 
An extension of the schoo! term is also urged, as in many sections of the State it is 
now only 5 or 6 months of the year, with change of teacher nearly every term. An 
enlargement of county supervision is another want. Many counties have become so 
populous as to have outgrown the old system of inspection. While accomplishing all 
it can, it is still insufficient to make itself properly felt over a range of districts where 
300 or 400 teachers are employed. The number of children out of school, as in neatly 
all the States, presents a serious and difficult question. In the matter of school books 
a uniformity established by law would seem to afford the only solution of the question, 
     
ADMINISTRATION. 
The public schools of the State are under the supervision of a State supérintendent 
of public instruction appointed for 4-year terms by the governor with the consent of 
the senate. Thesuperintendent may appoint a deputy. Local supervision is through 
a county superintendent for each county, elected by the school directors of the county, 
and through school directors in independent school districts in the county, 6 for each 
district, elected tor 3 years by the qualified voters. Women are eligible to all school 
offices. In consolidated districts (cities or boroughs) there are directors in each ward 
to look after school property and buildings and the collection and disbursement of 
taxes in that ward, with a board of controllers, composed of all these directors, for 
other school matters of the city or borough. Directors and controllers must provide 
a sufficient number of schools for the free education of all youth 6-21 years of age, 
without regard to race or color. The State also provides for the free instruction of the 
deaf, dumb, blind, and feeble-minded. The sessions of schools must cover at least 5 
months annually to entitle districts to their share of the appropriation. It is the duty 
of directors to establish night schools in cities and towns where there are sufficient 
youth needing instruction in them to warrant such schools. Half time schools are 
also permitted in cases where children cannot attend the whole time. Teachers must 
have certificates of qualification from the proper school officer, for which, see Prepa- 
ration and Qualifications of Teachers, further on.. They must also report monthly to 
the directors under whom they serve; these directors, annually to their county super- 
intendent; he, to the State superintendent, and he, in turn, to the legislature. 
The school month is 22 days, 2 of which days may be devoted to institutes for im- 
provement of the teachers. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
To support the school system the State appropriates annually $1,000,000 and author- 
izes in each school district the levy of an annual tax not to exceed 13 mills on the 
dollar for instruction and as much more for buildings. Fines and forfeitures are ap- 
plied to school purposes. The amount of State appropriation due each district is 
based upon the number of taxpayers, as certified by the county commissioners at each 
triennial assessment. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, under special laws, have boards of education which do not include the ward boards, 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
  230 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION.

three for each ward, and may have a superintendent where there is a population of 
, over 7,000 inhabitants.

tion in 1883-84. The schools are primary, grammar, high, and evening. Drawing, 
vocal music, penmanship, and physical culture are taught by the regular teachers. 
In 1883~'84 there was an increase in enrolment, in average daily attendance, in the 
number of schools, and in teachers. The schools were taught 10 months, 2 new build- 
ings being apparently added to that above reported, while a third was in process of 
erection, on the completion of which there would not be an old one left occupied. A 
quarterly institute, with an evening and a morning session, helps to improve the 
teachers. enon property was valued at $994,336. Enrolment in private and church 
schools, 1,500, 
Allentown for 1883-84 reported 59 schools in 10 buildings, with accommodations for 
3,495 pupils, The day schools were in session 193} days, and evening schools were 
opened for the first time, enrolling about 170 pupils. A high school library of 
about 400 volumes was secured by special effort, and several of the teachers began 
the formation of school cabinets representing the animal, vegetable, and mineral 
kingdoms. There was an increase in public school enrolment and in attendance. 
Valuation of school property, $460,000. Enrolment in private schools, 200. 
Altoona, in the same year, enrolled 3,375 youth between the ages of 6 and 16 and 84 
over 16, and had 1,000 in private schools. The schools were in session 192 days in 57 
rooms, with 3,447 sittings. The accommodations in 1882~83 were so short of the 
needs of the school population that several schools were obliged to hold only half 
’ day sessions to admit a double number daily, till a new building, in process of erection, 
was completed. This gave 13 additional rooms, but even then a church building had 
to be rented and preparations made for further building for use in 1884~85. 
Bradford reports for 1883-84 a substantial increase of school population, enrolment, ; 
and average attendance, the erection of a 7-room building, and the renting of another, 
Among new features introduced during the year was a systematic study of natural 
philosophy and chemistry in the eighth grade, with satisfactory results. Another was 
the opening of a public school library of nearly 1,300 volumes, obtained by voluntary 
subscriptions. Still another was the establishing of a printing department, at a cost 
of about $260. All blank forms used in the library and schools and much supple- 
mental reading matter are now printed, all work being done by the pupils under the 
supervision of an amateur printer. The average length of school time was 10 months. 
Carbondale shows advance in 188384. A now series of regulations for the govern- 
ment of the schools is said to have had a decidedly benficial effect, while a simplifica- 
tion of the course made the teachers’ work both more clear and more efficient. A ~ 
slight decrease was noted in enrolment, but there was an increase in average attend- 
ance. 
Chester had for its 2,675 enrolled pupils 10 school-houses, with 52 rooms and 2,356 
sittings, and supplied all needed books for pupils’ use, as in five preceding years, find- 
ing this plan economical and satisfactory. School property increased from $111,000 to 
$125,000. The schools were taught 196 days in the year, by 51 teachers, 30 of them 
graduates from the Chester High School, which is made to some extent a training 
school for teachers. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 700. 
Columbia had 1 more school in 1883~84 and an increase in enrolment and in average 
daily attendance, with 3 more teachers. The endeavor is made to teach words effectu- 
ally by having pupils carefully observe their forms, and to teach arithmetic by de- 
veloping the power of concentrating attention. Morals, but not religion, enter into 
the instruction given. 
Danville, in 1883-84, kept its schools open 8} months; they were taught by 4 men 
and 25 women. A small decrease in enrolment and a slight increase in attendance 
were reported, and the receipts exceeded the expenditures by $1,716. 
The Laston superintendent of public schools (William W. Cottingham; said, in a 
letter from that place, to have been longer continuously in one school office than any 
one else in the United States) reports for 1883-84 evidence of growth and progress in 
allthe publicschool departments. He says that during the last 30 years one new school- 
house has been built in the district, on an average, every 4 years, at an outlay, in the 
aggregate, of nearly $180,000. School property was valued in 1883~84 at $222,000. A 
weekly gathering of teachers for institute work was regularly maintained throughout 
the school year and was well attended, papers being read on topics of Breswiont school 
interest, with subsequent discussions. A normal class, composed of 19 graduates of 
the high school, was enrolled as a quasi part of the institute, with great advantage. 
A special course of instruction on the theory of teaching was given this class by the 
city superintendent. 
Erie reports a carefully revised course of study for 1883-’84, making the use of 
the English language prominent in the lower grades, where a specially qualified 
teacher was made superintendent of primary instruction. A training class was estab- 
lished in connection with the high school at the beginning of the school year, enroll- 
ing 14 during the year. The study of German was pursued in all the schools by over 
95 per cent. of the pupils in this year, under 10 special teachers. A special school for 
instruction in mechanical drawing was.organized in January, 1884, tobe .opened.day

and evening to the pupils of the grammar grades and to men and boys employed in 
shops. Teachers’ institutes were held throughout the year, with efforts to get rid of 
rote work and to cultivate individual observation, thinking, and expression. 
Harrisburg reports for 1883~84 gradual but sure progress in its public schools, 
with an increase in numbers, interest, and efficiency. The schools (6 of them for col- 
ored children) were taught 198 days in 23 buildings, with accommodations for 5,870 
pupils and, it is said, with much improved school apparatus, such as outline maps, 
charts, dictionaries, and pronouncing gazetteers. Mechanical drawing was taught in 
the boys’ intermediate, grammar, and high schools and industrial drawing in the 
girls’ high school by special teachers, with very satisfactory results. In other grades, 
containing a much larger number of pupils, drawing was taught by the regular 
teachers. Music is also taught in all grades below the high school. 
Johnstown reports 1883~84 to have been a year of progress in attendance, of greater 
thoroughness in instruction, and of more efficient working in the entire educational 
system. A slight decrease in enrolment was noted, with an increase of 2 per cent. 
in daily attendance. A new brick building, containing 8 rooms, well ventilated, was 
erected at a cost of $24,000. The city is thus amply provided with school accommo- 
dations, There wero 4 institutes held during the year for the benefit of the teachers, 
with perfect attendance and gratifying results. A new system of drawing awakened 
renewed interest in the study and brought about a great improvement in the quality 
of ine work done. Of the teachers in the schools, 6 were graduates of the high 
school, 
Lancaster, for 1883-84, reports a slight increase in enrolment, a falling off in the 
average daily attendance, a new school building erected, and 2 more normally trained 
teachers employed, making 4 such in all. Each of the professors of Franklin and 
Marshall College, adjoining the city, kindly gave the members of the high school a 
monthly lecture on some subject akin to the studies pursued in the school. Within 
the last 4 years, 6 new school-houses have been built, with all necessary light, ventila- 
tion, and apparatus, many of the teachers furnishing this last themselves. The same ~ 
spirit of improvement has prompted some of them to form a collection of books for a 
school library, others making arrangements for a supply from the public libraries. 
Lebanon, in 1883-84, had a small decrease in enrolment, with an increase of 142 in 
daily attendance. The schools were taught 187 days in 8 buildings, with 31 rooms 
for study. The estimated number enrolled in-private schools was 400, which, added 
to the enrolment in public schools, makes 2,035, leaving only 100 youth 6 to 21 years 
of age not attending any school. Valuation of all school property for 1883~84 was 
$34,000. McKeesport had 4 school buildings, with 1,560 sittings for study, valued at $75,000. 
The schools were taught 169 days by 2 men and 31 women. Estimated enrolment in 
private and church schools, 300. 
Mahanoy City reports a success, after several years of effort, in the establishment of a 
systematic course of oral instruction in object lessons, awakening interest and thought 
in both teacher and pupil and doing much to relieve the monotony of school life. 
There were 13 graduates from its high school at the close of the spring session of 1884, 
each graduate that reached 75 per cent. on an average in the final examinations re- 
ceiving a diploma showing the percentage made in each branch. 
Meadville reports the year 1883~84 one of unusual activity and progress in school 
work, under the influences of the “new education.” Weekly teachers’ institutes 
were held, The daily composition work, suggested by pictures sketched upon the 
blackboard and drawn from familiar objects and subjects, is said to have greatly stim- 
ulated literary taste and readiness of expression in the children. Letter writing and 
business forms also received attention. Music, drawing, and penmanship were 
tanght, but no special teachers were employed. Estimated private school enrol- 
ment, 210. 
New Castle reports for 1883 and 1884 a great improvement in educational affairs, 
secured by the united effortsof the school officers, patrons, and teachers. During the 
past two years the schools have reached a high standard. The salaries of teachers 
have been increased and the result has been that the services of a large number of 
certificated teachers were secured. Of the 32 employed, all but 3 have had five or 
more years of experience, while some have taught continuously for ten or twelve 
years. 
Norristown classes its schools as primary, secondary, grammar, and high, the entire 
system covering eleven years. The attendance in 1883~84 was 2 per cent. more than 
in the preceding year and is said to have been the fullest ever secured, partly, it 
would seem, from the fact that there are many experienced and progressive teachers 
and partly from the fact that object teaching is attended to in the primary grades 
and very naturally interests the children. Institutes for improvement of the teachers 
were held semi-monthiy, with efforts to make them as practical as possible by dis- 
cussion of subjects bearing on current work, _ Truancy in the schools is limited to a

small number. Valuation of all school property, $158,600, Enrolment in private 
schools, 300. 
Philadelphia, in 1883, had, for the first time, a superintendent for its schools, who 
estimated its youth between 6 and 16 (the legal school age for the city) to be 160,000 
and those 6 to 21 (the legal school age for the State) to be 250,000, no census being 
taken, The enrolment in the public schools was 90,000 of those 6 to 16 years of age ~ 
and 15,424 of those between 16 and 21. It is estimated that there were 18,000 in 
private and church schools,! making, in all, 123,424 under school instruction and 
Jeaving 36,576 as the estimated number between 6 and 16 not attending any day school. 
The city system includes primary, secondary, grammar, high, normal, and evening 
schools. Vocal music, drawing, and penmanship are taught and physical training 
is strongly recommended, but no special teachers are employed for these branches. 
The schools were in session 205 days in 284 buildings, with 2,475 rooms for study and 
recitation. The evening schools used 344 rooms in 47 of the day school buildings 
and had a total enrolment of 12,590 pupils, with an average attendance of about 3,000 
males and 990 females. Inthe day schools, 82 men and 2,086 women teachers were em- 
ployed, at an average monthly salary of $117 for the men and $41 for the women. 
Estimated value of all public school property, $6,934,789. 
The change from almost utter lack of direction to the skillful supervision of all 
the schools by a superintendent and four assistant superintendents was accomplished, - 
at the opening of the school year, with much less friction than might have been 
expected, and has abundantly justified itself by excellent results, Superintendent 
MacAlister has evidently secured the hearty codperation of the city school authorities, 
and, working with judicious caution, has been enabled to reduce to fair proportions a 
greatly overloaded city school course, to make the nominal supervising principalships 
something of a reality, to introduce the Boston adjuncts of sewing for the girls and 
tool work for a portion of the boys, and to bring the teachers into full harmony with 
the somewhat changed system by a series of conferences with them. 
Pittsburgh shows for 1883~84 an increase of attendance which, the superintendent 
says, has more than kept pace with the increase in school population. Of the im- 
provement in school accommodations, he saysthe Riverside district completed one of 
the finest 8-room buildings in the State; 2 others of 6 rooms each were in process of 
erection ; another, of 15 rooms and an audience hall, wasin preparation for the fall 
session; and one was enlarged by the addition of a third story —making, in all, 56 
buildings, valued, with grounds and apparatus, at $2,000,000. The schools were classed 
as primary, grammar, high, normal, and evening. The day schools were taught 10 
months in the year. The average monthly salary of men teaching was $180; of 
women, $50. An increase of 1,726 in enrolment is noted and of 1 in average at- 
tendance. Evening schools were open 60 nights, with an, enrolment of 2,404 boys and 
204 girls, Average attendance of boys, 677; of girls, 73. Cost per pupil, based on 
average attendance for term of 60 evenings, $5.22.

Pottsville occupied a part of its school term in 1883~84 with an examination of the 
eyes of pupils, to determine, if possible, whether school work under fair condi- 
tions is injurious to fairly clear vision. The result was a satisfactory demonstration 
of good condition of the eyes in a very great majority of cases. Out of 1,895 pupils 
examined, 1,346 were found to see well with both eyes and with each, 1,619 were in 
fair normal condition with both eyes, and 276 or about 14 per cent. were more or less 
detective. This is considered a very fair showing for a city in the heart of the coal 
mining region, where eyes are frequently exposed to injury from dust as well as from 
the effect of using them in study. 
Reading for 1883~84 reported the entire school population receiving school instruc- 
tion. The schools were taught 220 days in 26 buildings, with 146 rooms and 7,750 
sittings for study. School property was valued at $318,300. ‘The course of study, 
which had been somewhat undefined, was carefully revised; the foundation of a 
teachers’ library was laid by adding works on pedagogics to about 400 volumes of a 
general character; and a new building, said to be very complete, was erected during 
the year for the boys’ high school, at a cost of $64,600. . 
Seranton had 2 school buildings erected during 1883~’84, 1 enlarged, and others 
remodelled in accordance with school needs. Further school accommodations were 
required, and the board of control was about to erect two buildings, each to contain 
300 sittings. A substantial increase was noted in enrolment and attendance. The 
corps of teachers for the year included 10 graduates from State normal schools, 5 col- 
lege graduates, 52 graduates from the Scranton High School, and 2 seminary graduates. 
Schools were insession 10months. Anoral classfor the instruction of deaf-mutes, under 
the control of the city board and taught by a special teacher, was organized at the 
beginning of the school year, numbering 20 pupils. City teachers’ institutes were 
held throughout both 1882~83 and 1883-84, with their usual good results, and a 
county institute in November, 1883, was attended by all the teachers of the city, 
1 Some of these were Kindergiirten, for which, see Tables III and V of appendix,

        284 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Shamokin for 1883~84 reported 23 schools, with an enrolment increased during the’ 
year by 140 and average daily attendance by 203. Semimonthly institutes and weekly 
grade meetings were maintained and attended. Vocal music was made a regular 
study in the schocls, and a special teacher was appointed to instruct the regular 
teachers in giving instruction in this study. Corporal punishment was prohibited in 
alk the schools. 
Shenandoah, in the same year, had 5 school buildings, with 26 rooms and 2,010 sit- 
tings, valued at $63,000. The schools were closed 27 days earlier than usual 
of, the prevalence of small-pox, leaving only 159 days of actual school work; still, 
there was but a small decrease in enrolment and average daily attendance for the 
year. Music and drawing were taught by a special teacher. Of the 29 teache 
ployed, 24 held diplomas from State normal schools; the remaining 5, per 
certificates or diplomas from other institutions. The superintendent recommends 
the employment of experienced teachers, even if high salaries must be paid to secure 
their services, 
Titusville, in 1883~84, taught its schools 190 days, and had 3 special teachers for 
music, drawing, and French and German, and 1 regular teacher for an evening school. 
Penmanship reached a higher standard than ever before. Enrolment in private 
schools, 450. 
Wilkes-Barre, in 16 school buildings, with 73 rooms for study and recitation, kept 
its schools in session 10 months, securing an increase in enrolment and attendance. 
Evening schools, occupying public school buildings, were maintained in each of the 
3 city districts. 
Williamsport, in 188384, had 25 school buildings, with 58 rooms and accommoda- 
tions for 3,515 pupils. Public schools were in session 185 days and had an inereased 
enrolment ‘and attendance. Private schools enrolled 1,300. Night schools were or- 
anized, but were not a success. In the last nine years the number of schools has 
increased from 47 to 68, and the average number of pupils enrolled is now 53 to each 
teacher, All buildings used for school purposes are owned by the district, except one. 
Of the 68 teachers only 2 were inexperienced and these were graduates from the city 
high school. A public school library numbers over 1,000 volumes, the books said to 
be well selected, for which $381 were expended during the year. Public school prop- 
erty was valued at $150,990. 
York enrolled 2,400 youth between the ages of 6 and 16 years and 68 over 16, a 
slight decrease from the number in 1882-83. Schools were taught 9 months, in 11 
buildings, containing 48 rooms, with 2,650 sittings. Private schools were conducted 
in 3 rooms, with 350 sittings, and had an enrolment of 300 pupils. Valuation of public 
school property, $150,000. A separate school for colored aidsea was maintained. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information as to a number of these important means of early training for 
young children, see Table V of the appendix; for a summary of their statistics, a 
corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. Some that are 
engaged in normal training may be found in Table II. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES.    
   
   
     
   
     
       Teachers must have certificates of qualification from some recognized school officer, 
ssuch as a county, borough, or city superintendent or principal of a State normal 
school, which certificates must specify the branches the applicant has been found qual- 
ified to teach and the degree of efficiency shown in each. These certificates may be 
either provisional or professional, the former being given to spplgants who 8 
fair knowledge of the common school branches of study, or to those who prove a thor- 
ough knowledge of these but have had little or no experience in teaching ; the latter 
limited to those only who, in addition to thorough knowledge of the 
branches, can prove successful experience in teaching. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The 10 State normal schools, at Bloomsburg, California, Edinboro’, Indiana, 
town, Lock Haven, Mansfield, Millersville, Shippensburg, and Westchester, are 
in part sustained by the State, the appropriation for 1883~84 being $10,000 for 
of 5 and $5,000 for each of the others. The course of normal training covers fi om 2 
to 4 years, according to the position sought. Graduates receive certificates of quali- 
fication, which authorize them to teach in the common schools of the State w 
farther examination. The whole attendance for the year was 4,656; of normal stu- 
dents, 3,405, 1,764 of them young men and 1,641 young women. Elementary, scien- 
tific, and classical studies are pursued and all have model schools, with a total a 
ance of 1,249 pupils. Value of the entire school property, $1,511,902; income for 
the year, $392,208; expenditure, $371,198,

OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Tho Normal School for Girls, Philadelphia, has a 4-year course. The normal pupils 
must attend the fourth year, to qualify themselves and show by actual work in 
the school of practice that they are fitted to do good service as teachers. Graduates 
from this course are awarded certificates that entitle them to teach in the public 
schools of the city without further examination. Whole enrolment for 1883, 1,025; 
average attendance, 1,001. : ; 
The Central High School, for boys, in the same city, has a 4-year normal course, from 
which 25 young men graduated and received teachers’ certificates during the year. 
Chester is reported in 1883-84 to have used its high schools as a means of training ~ 
pupils for teaching. ' 
Laston showed a normal class of 19 graduates of its high school in the same year. 
Pittsburgh has a normal department in its public schools, which requires 2 years of 
preparatory study for admission; then, apparently, a year of attention to the branches 
to be taught and to methods of teaching. This had, in 1882~83, 51 normal pupils, 
under 5 instructors. Graduates of the year, 23. ; 
Most of the cities and boroughs report in 1883884 meetings of teachers for educa- 
tional readings and discussions of educational topics and methods, substantially 
equivalent to normal classes. 
The Normal College, Huntingdon, has a normal English course of 3 years, the first of 
which is preparatory and answers to the elementary course of the State normal 
schools. Lectures on teaching enter into the first and second years and the science 
of teaching and review of studies into the third. Normal students in 1883-84, 21; 
gradnates from the normal course in 1883, 6. 
Lycoming County Normal School, Muncy, in 1883-84, had 151 pupils in its normal de- 
partment, which includes preparatory, junior, and senior years. This department 
is under the supervision of the county superintendent, and the students are required, 
in the 2 years of normal training, to take a course in the theory and practice of teach- 
ing. A model school of 50 pupils is connected with the department. 
‘The following colleges offer normal instruction: IVesiminsier College, New Wilming- 
ton, in a summer institute, which, in 1883, covered about 5 weeks and had 32 normal 
students in attendance, 13 of them collegiate; Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, 
which has a 2-year course in principles and methods of teaching and school govern- 
ment and in the science of education; and Ursinus College, Freeland, where also there 
is a 2-year course, under a special professor, in the science and art of teaching. * 
Pine Grove Normal Acadeny, Grove City, presents a 4-year course of study. Classes 
are organized each term in theory of teaching and methods of instruction. Number 
of students in normal classes not given. 
The Institute for Colored Youth, Philadelphia, has a high school course covering 4 
years, the 3 higher classes of which are instructed in the theory and practice of teach- 
ing and take part in the instruction of the preparatory departments, one of which is 
for boys and one for girls. 
Four private training schools for Kindergartners appear in Philadelphia in 1883~84, 
namely, the Jroebel raining School for Kindergartners, under Miss M. L. Morrison; 
the Philadelphia Training School for Kindergartners, Mrs. M. L. Van Kirk; the Centen- 
nial Kindergarten Training School for Teachers, under Miss Ruth R. Burritt, and the 
Kindergarten Training Class, in charge of Ann W. Barnard, West Philadelphia. For 
statistics and other information respecting these, see Table III of the appendix. 
The Normal Training School for Teachers of ihe Oral Method, connected with the 
Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, offers a course of instruction cov- 
ering 6 months, and graduates are prepared to teach lip reading to the deaf, a cor- 
rect articulation to the semi-deaf, and to improve the more or less imperfect articula- 
tion of the semi-mute, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ institutes, as paovaded by law, were held in all the counties in the State 
between August, 1883, and January, 1884, the greater part having sessions of five days. 
Whole number of actual members present, 17,373; the largest attendance being in 
Berks, Lancaster,-and Schuylkill Counties, each of which had over 700 enrolled. The 
number of common school teachers attending was 13,480; of school directors, 2,843; 
of others, 38,195. There were 597 instructors and lecturers employed, at a cost of 
Bio Other expenses amounted to $12,287. Receipts exceeded expenditures by 
3,199, 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The Pennsylvania School Journal, published monthly at Lancaster and edited by 
the State superintendent, in its thirty-second volume in 1883~84, continued to be the 
official organ of the State department of common schools and the State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation. It gives much valuable information as to principles and facts in education 
of both local and general interest, 5;

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The public high schools, though authorized as graded schools, are not as clearly de- 
fined in Pennsylvania as in some otherStates. Outside of Philadelphia, which has 2 in 
its city system, there were, in 1882~83, 2,222 and in the next year 2,306 public| schools 
in which some branches beyond the ordinary and required school studies were reported 
to have been taught. The number of pupils in such branches, however, is not given. 
In the reports from city and borough superintendents appended to the State report 
of 1883~84, it appears that besides the Philadelpbia Boys’ High School, with 576 pupils 
in 1883, and the high and normal schools for girls, of the same city, with 1,025 in the 
same year, high schools were maintained in 1883~84 in at least the following |places: 
Allegheny, Allentown, Bethichem, Chester, Columbia, Corry, Easton, Erie, Harrisburg, 
Hazleton, Johnstown, Lancaster, Mahanoy City, Pittsburgh, Pottsville, Reading, 
Scranton, Shamokin, Shenandoah, Titusville, and West Chester. Harrisburg and 
Reading, like Philadelphia, had 2, one for each sex; Pittsburgh, a central high|school, 
with academic, commercial, and normal departments. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
A list of 39 academic schools under private or church influences appears in the State 
report for 188384, but it is believed that this cannot be complete, though schools 
of this class are said to be fast dying out because of the increased number and excel- 
lence of public schools. 
For statistics of such schools, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for sum- 
aes of their statistics, corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, the oldest and most important of its 
class in the State, continued in the 2 years under review its high grade of instruc- 
tion in the departments previously reported, but with some improvement of standard 
and a considerable rearrangement of its faculties. ‘These faculties, as rearranged in 
1883, are (1) the college faculty, comprising the faculties of arts, science, finance 
~and economy, and music; (2) the faculty of medicine; (3) that of law; (4) that of 
dentistry ; (5) that of sciences auxiliary to medicine, and (6) that of philosophy. 
These faculties together constitute an academic council for the consideration of ques- 
tions touching the general interests of the university ; while each separate faculty has a 
dean and secretary and makes its own regulations for discipline, promotion, and rec- 
ommendation for degrees, the qualifications for admission to any department or to its 
degrees are determined by its faculty, subject to the approval of the trustees|of the 
university. 
The courses of lectures on German literature, older English classics, Norse history, 
and physics and chemistry, noticed in the last report as open to the public, continue 
to be so open on payment of moderate fees. A department of physical culture was 
authorized in 1883. 
In 1882~83 and 1883~84, 24 other collegiate institutions reported, St. Joseph’s, Phil- 
adelphia, not among them, Waynesburg College remaining closed, and Pennsyl- 
vania State College (while offering a fall collegiate course) continuing to be largely 
scientific, as will appear under Scientific and Professional Instruction, furth 
All but 9 of the 24 institutions show preparatory courses of 1 to 4 years; all, ¢ 
collegiate courses of 4 years, except St. Vincent, St. Francis, and Pittsburgh Colleges, 
which show collegiate courses of 2 and 3 years, with grades very little beyond those 
of fair preparatory schools; while 17 show scientific courses that will be noticed further 
on. As in 1882, the purely collegiate institutions undertaking no preparatory work 
were, besides the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University and Haverford and 
Lafayette Colleges. Dickinson College was, by mistake, included with these in the 
last report, it having a preparatory school, as have also such colleges as Franklin and 
Marshall, Lancaster ; Muhlenberg, Allentown; Pennsylvania, Gettysburg ; Washing- 
ton and Jefferson, Washington ; the Western University of Pennsylvania, Allegheny, 
and the University at Lewisburg; while Swarthmore, with 8 outside prepatatory 
schools to draw from, still retains its own excellent preparatory 4-year course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
PENNSYLVANIA. 237 
Lehigh University and Haverford College continued their rule of conferring ad- 
vanced degrees only on graduates that pursue under direction of their faculties the 
special courses prescribed for such degrees, passing examinations on them, and Swarth- 
more in 1884~85 is to follow the same rule as respects the master’s degree. 
For statistics of all these colleges reporting, see Table 1X of the appendix; fora 
summary of their statistics, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Lebanon Valley, Ursinus, Thiel, Monongahela, Allegheny, Westminster, and Swarth- 
more Colleges, with the University at Lewisburg, continued in 1883-84 to admit young 
women, Lewisburg having a special institute for them, while the University ot 
Pennsylvania opens to them as to others the free courses of lectures on literary and 
scientific subjects above referred to. 
The names of 16.colleges and schools especially for the instruction of young women 
appear on the list of this Office. Most of these show a fair grade of studies for their 
kind, while some provide studies of a collegiate character. Among these the 
palatial school at Ogontz, near Philadelphia, which cost its liberal donor, Mr. Jay 
Cooke, $1,000,000, well merits special mention, alike for its beautiful accommodations 
and surroundings and for its excellent school work; while to this is to be added an 
elegant and admirable Friends’ College at Bryn Mawr, founded by the late Joseph 
W. Taylor, of Burlington, N. J., at an expense for grounds and buildings of several 
hundred thonsand dollars and of $800,000 for endowment, the college to be opened in 
October, 1885. 
For statistics of such of these institutions as report, see Table VIII of the appendix; 
for a summary of their statistics, the report of the Commissioner preceding, 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Pennsylvania State College, State College Station, has advanced from the Farm- 
ers’ High School of 1859 and the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania of 1862 to a 
well organized college of technology, with 3 general, 4 technical, and 2 special courses 
and with provision also for select or partial courses. Under these arrangements it is 
said to be doing more in the direction of progressive and scientific agricultural in- 
struction than when that was its principal object. Young women are admitted as 
well as young men, A separate course for ladies is proposed, with more branches of 
study especially serviceable to them and fewer mathematical and scientific studies 
than in the present courses. Military instruction is given. Farmers’ institutes are 
held annually in January and February to meet the wants of progressive farmers. Its 
agricultural experiments are published in regular bulletins. The principal income is 
from the proceeds of the sale of public Jands donated to the State by the General Gov- 
ernment. For statistics of it, see Table X. 
In 18 of the other colleges, in the 2 years under review, general scientific courses of 
3 and 4 years continued, while the Western University of Pennsylvania, the Pennsyl- 
vania Military Academy, Lehigh University, Lafayette College, and Swarthmore Col- 
lege gave special and thorough training in civil, mechanical, and mining engineering, 
with chemical and metallurgical instruction, in 4-year courses. Haverford College - 
offers instruction in these studies as electives. At the Towne Scientific School of the 
University of Pennsylvania, the course in these studiesis of 5 yearsand appears to be 
exceptionally thorough. 
The Wharton School of Finance and Economy, in its fourth year in 1883~84, continues 
to provide for young men special training in modern finance and economy. The 
course of study extends through 2 years for properly prepared students and corre- 
sponds in time and quality with the last 2 years of a fair scientific course. 
The Wagner Free Institute of Science, Philadelphia, continued in 1883 its useful work 
of helping forward persons desiring to fit themselves for industrial pursuits. Instrue- 
tion was given in 2 annual courses of free lectures. The natural sciences formed the 
distinguishing feature of the course, but the institute aimed to give a liberal educa- 
tion, including various branches of literature and the arts.! 
Girard College for Orphans, in the same field of work, trains at least a part of its 
boys in the use of tools and in the first steps in mechanics, as may be seen further on. 
A mining firm at Drifton, Lucerne County, reported in 1883 the continuance of an 
Industrial School for Miners and Mechanics, aiming to fit its pupils to be good mechanics 
and overseers of mines, Attendance for the year, 29 preparatory and 81 other pupils. 
The course is meant to cover 3 years, but attendance is irregular. 
For statistics of the above schools, see Table X of the appendix; for a summary of 
those statistics, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
1Tn consequence of the death of Mr. Wagner further information ‘is wanting, except that the insti- tute will be continued and that its endowment is made sure.

    288 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL. : re i 
Theology.— In Table XI of the appendix the statistics and church connection of 17 
theological schools and departments in the State may be found; also, a summary of 
such statistics in the report of the Commissioner preceding. These schools and depart- 
ments generally require, as a preparation for their3-year courses, at least an academic 
and, if possible, a collegiate course; that of Lincoln University (for colored youth), 
with a regular 3-year course, has a special English course for non-graduates. The 
Moravian school, Bethlehem, shows still only a 2-year course following a semicol- 
legiate one of 4 years. ‘Tho Theological Seminary of St. Charles, Philadelphia, 
and the Augustinian Colloge of Villanova, near that city, include academic and col- 
legiate studies with the theological, carrying them on together. Dickinson College 
does nearly the same, combining the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Greek of 
the New with its collegiate course, for such students as wish to prepare for the min- 
istry. Allegheny College, heretofore reporting a similar arrangement, seems to have 
dropped it, as it does not appear in the college catalogue for 188384 
Law coutinued to be taught for the two years under review in the law department 
of the University.of Pennsylvania, in a course of 2 years, with terms of 4 months 
each year. Instruction is given mainly in lectures, on which students are frequently 
examined, and in moot courts. Graduates are admitted to practise in the courts of 
common pleas and in the orphans’ court in Philadelphia, 
Medicine.— The representatives of the ‘‘regular” school of medicine continued to 
be the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Medical Col- 
. lege, the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia, and the Woman’s Medical Col- 
lege of Pennsylvania, all in Philadelphia and with good courses of 3 collegiate 
‘years, ample teaching force, and, except Jefferson and the Woman’s College, with high 
requirements for admission. The courses in all but Jefferson are graded, and Jeffer- 
son recommends such a course, but does not require it; while both the university 
school and the Woman’s College recommend u 4-year graded course. The university, 
besides its regular school, has both an auxiliary and a graduate school for such as 
wish to extend their studies beyond the regular course into the science of medicine, 
or into its pathology ané bed-side practice. ‘here is also in Philadelphia a Polyclinic 
School of Medicine with the same aims. 
The homeopathic school was represented, as before, by the Hahnemann Medical 
College, Philadelphia, with 18 instructors, a required 2-year course of 21 weeks annu- 
ally, a recommended 3-year course, and high requirements for admission. 
Dentistry.— The Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery, the Philadelphia Dental 
College, and the department of dentistry of the University of Pennsylvania, all in 
Philadelphia, continue their courses of 2 years of 20 weeks each, the course in the last 
being a graded one. 
Pharmacy.— Philadelphia and Pittsburgh each report, as in former years a College 
of Pharmacy, with 2-year courses uf 20 weeks each, designed to follow a 4-year ap- 
prenticeship with some reputable apothecary. 
Veterinary.— The University of Pennsylvania, in 1883-84, so far progressed in the 
establishment of a department of veterinary medicine as to purchase ground, erect a, 
building, with large rooms for dissection and laboratory work, stables for hospital use, 
and had so nearly completed its faculty that the formal opening of the department was 
announced for September, 1884. 
For statistics of medical, dental, and pharmaceutical schools, see Table XIII of the 
appendix; for summaries of their statistics, a like table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
    SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
TRAINING IN ART. 
The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, admits both sexes, but has 
separate life classes for men and women in sketching, painting, and drawing and in 
the study of the antique. 
The Philadelphia School of Design for Women aims to qualify young women for the 
application of art to the common uses of daily life. The subjects taught are design- 
ing, modelling, lithography, painting, architecture, wood engraving, china decora- 
tion, and the tasteful shaping and adorning of manufactured articles. The school has 
an annual grant from the State in aid of its work and receives 15 free pupils from 
the grammar and normal schools of Philadelphia each year. }. 
The School of Industrial Art attached to the Pennsylvania Museum offers instruction 
in wood carving, drawing, and the study of color. Day and evening classes, open to 
‘both sexes, are under a principal and assistant instructors, i 
The Philadelphia School of Art Needlework gives instruction in painting, preparation 
of designs, art needlework, &c. ee 
The Drawing School of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, in 1882~83, made gone 
progress in effectiveness of instruction and number of pupils, The pupils at the spring
-P-A-G-E-511

term numbered 192; those at the winter term, 184. There was a slight falling off in 
the attendance of 1884, the spring term enrolment being 166; that of the winter term, 
178 The-school was divided into seven classes, one teacher for each class. 
TRAINING FOR USEFUL INDUSTRIES. 
Girard College for Orphans, opened in 1848 with 100 boys, had in 1883 an enrolment cf 
1,105; in 1884, of 1,132. Besides the branches of a common English education the 
‘more advanced pupils are instructed in algebra, book-keeping, drawing, chemistry, 
geometry, natural history, navigation, surveying, trigonometry, French, and Spanish. 
Technical instruction was introduced in 1882, and the results of the experiment were 
so satisfactory that in the following year the board caused to be erected a new build- 
ing supplied with steam and fully equipo’ with all necessary machinery, tools, &c., 
at a cost of $93,000. Three hundred of the older and more advanced pupils attend 
this department an average of 5 hours each week and are taught to work in 
metals and wood under skilful and experienced teachers. Only poor white orphan 
boys between the ages of 6 and 10 years are admitted. They are boarded, clothed, 
and educated at the expense of the college fund, and, by the will of the founder, are 
bound out between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The officers of the institution are 
4 professors and 32 teachers, and the household is under the care of a matron, an 
assistant matron, 12 prefects, and 14 governesses, who have the care of the boys when 
notin school. Corporal punishment is only administered in extreme cases. 
The Spring Garden Institute, Philadelphia, in 1882~83 considerably improved its 
means of instruction by the equipment of a pattern shop, by the introduction of new 
desks for its drawing schools, and by the development of its mechanical handiwork 
department through the aid of a naval officer detailed for the purpose by President 
Arthur. The pupils in its drawing schools that year numbered 472; in its handiwork 
schools, 181; while 9,030 books were loaned from its library, which haa 22,042 readers. 
In 1883-84 instruction was given to 426 pupils, 595 of them in the drawing schools 
and 231 in those for mechanical handiwork, 140 of the whole number being day 
scholars, the remainder in evening classes. Large facilities for vise work, lathe work, 
pattern making, and elementary steam engineering are afforded. 
INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY. 
The New Century Cooking School, Philadelphia, was started by the New Centiry 
Club, apparently in 188182, to teach young women who might afterwards have 
charge of homes how to prepare viands, both palatable and nutritious, yet cheap. It 
was conducted for two years under the auspices of the club, and then the expensive 
classes were assumed by the teacher, Mrs. 8. T. Rorer, as a business enterprise, the club 
retaining the cheap classes, which were incorporated with other evening classes for 
workingwomen at 1112 Girard street. The success of. the school in its useful line of 
training is attested by high authorities, well cooked and palatable dinners having 
been prepared at a cost of from 9 to 12 cents for each participant and publicly tested 
with high approval. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Philadelphia, with a principal 
and 28 teachers, in 1883 had. under instruction 436 pupils, of whom 184 were girls. 
The institution was founded in 1820, since which time 2,079 pupils have received iu- 
struction and 15 graduates have become teachers in similar institutions. Common 
school studies were pursued. Articulation was taught to a class of 74 pupils. The 
employments pursued were dressmaking, shoemaking, and tailoring. 
The School for Oral Instruction, Philadelphia, a branch of the Pennsylvania Insti- 
tution for the Deaf and Dumb, reported 46 boys and 28 girls, under 8 instructors, in 
1883. Articulation, lip reading, and the English branches were taught. Another 
branch is for the training of teachers of the oral method. 
The Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Wilkinsburg, founded 
in 1876, reported 120 pupils, under 7 instructors, in 1882~’83. Articulation and the 
common school branches were taught. State appropriation for the year, $26,700 for 
maintenance and $60,000 for buildings. Gifts were received during the year to the 
amount of $20,000 in land for sites and $55,000 in money for building purposes. 
eh pavers just completed at the date of the return (September, 1883), at a cost 
of $150,000, 
The Pennsylvania Oral School for Deaf and Dumb, Scranton, under the control of the 
city board of education, was founded in September, 1883, and reported 10 boys and 10 
‘irls, under the instruction of Miss Emma Garrett, the originator of the School for 
ral Instruction in Philadelphia, Articulation was taught to all the pupils. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Philadelphia, in 1883 
had 155 inmates from Pennsylvania, 12 from New Jersey, and 2 from Delaware, under
-P-A-G-E-512
  240 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
10 teachers of school studies, 11 of music, and 12 of employments. The pupils were 
taught the common and higher English branches, with German and vocal and instru- 
mental music; also, the usual industries practicable for the blind and useful in 
self support. The library contained 1,250 embossed books and 1,000 others. State 
appropriations for 1883 were $43,500 from Pennsylvania, $3,687 from New Jersey, avd 
$793 from Delaware; from private pupils, $600. Value of all property belonging to 
the institution, $206,000. J 
Industrial training was given to nearly 100 in the Pennsylvania Working Home 
for Blind Men in 1883. Of the Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women, Phila- 
delphia, no statistics are given in the report of the board of public charities. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn, for 1882~83 reported 396 
children, 203 of them supported wholly or in part by the State, 61 by the State of 
of New Jersey, 2 by Delaware, 18 by the city of Philadelphia, 81 by parents or guar- 
dians, 1 by the soldiers’ orphans’ fund, and 30 free. The industries taught are mat- 
tress and shoe making, caning, farm and garden work, sewing, and general house- 
work. The appliances of the schools and the facilities for training to usefulness in 
the shops and kitchens and on the farm were steadily increasing. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Pennsylvania Reform School, formerly House of Refuge of Western Pennsyl- 
_ vania, Morganza, was established in 1854 for the care and training of juvenile offend- 
ers. All property belonging to the institution, consisting of over 500 acres of land, a 
substantial building, sufficient for the accommodation of 350 inmates, with work- 
shops, &c., was conveyed to the State in 1878 and is now under its control. Light 
saddlery and carpet weaving are the chief industries, which, with shoemaking and 
the necessary farm and garden work, afford the boys useful employment in summer 
and winter, while the girls are instructed in domestic employments, the laundry 
work of the entire institution being performed by them, The inmates are required 
to attend school 43 hours each day. There were 284 boys and 6% girls in the institu- 
tion in 1853, of whom 36 boys and 12 girls were colored. 
The House of Refuge, Philadelphia, established in 1826 for the purpose of properly 
training wayward children, is supported by aid from the State and from the city of 
Philadelphia, by labor of the children, and by contributions, The average daily num- 
ber in the institution is not often less than 500 and the total number frequently 
reaches 700. January 1, 1884, there were 729. The estimate of the earnings of the 
inmates is about $12,000 annually. The children are required to devote 3 hours 
of each day to school duties, which include common English studies, with music. 
The hours given to labor in the shops are 44 each day, employment being largely 
relied on as a correctional agency. The industries for the boys include brush making, 
weaving, and knitting, tasks being set, but the boysare paid for extra work. Laundry 
and housework are performed by the girls, 
TRAINING OF INDIAN YOUTH. 
The Indian Industrial School, Carlisle, reports through its superintendent 239 boys 
and 122 girls connected with the school at date of the report for 1882-83. To these 
were aed, in 1883-84, 139 boys and 69 girls, making a total of 569. Of this whole 
number 194 were within the year returned to the Indian agencies from which they 
came and 6 died, leaving 369 connected with the school. Of those returned to 
agencies 8 went into western schools of their race as employés, and good reports were 
received from all but 2; others that went home were employed at the last accounts 
in schools at the agencies and in new schools away from these. Of those remaining 
at the school, 27 girls were transferred, at the instance of the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs, to the Lincoln Institution, Philadelphia; 44 girls and 173 boys were 
placed in families and on farms, and of these about 110 were to remain away during 
at least the winter of 188485 to attend the public schools or receive instruction from 
the families in which they were under training. By far the greater part of those 
placed out were well reported of by those to whom they had been committed, and in 
‘his mingling of Indian youth with whites in the ordinary work of school, home, 
and farm the superintendent of the Carlisle school thinks that a practical solution 
of the difficulties of civilizing the Indians may be reached, especially if the General 
Government should grant to Indians the privilege of citizenship. 
The system of half a day in the school room and the other half in work in the 
shops, sewing room, and laundry was continued, with increased advantages, through 
the liberality of a friend ofthe school, an alternation of work and study being found 
to produce the best effects.

TRAINING OF NURSES. 
Training schools for nurses are found in connection with the Woman’s Hospital and 
Blockley Hospital, Philadelphia. For statistics of these and any others reporting, see 
Table XVII of the appendix, and for summary of the same, the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
PENNSYLVANIA TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its twenty-ninth annual meeting at Williamsport July 10-12, 
1883, President N. C. Schaeffer, of Kutztown Normal School, in the chair. There was 
a total attendance of 450 members, 8 of whom were from other States. Dr. Schaeffer, 
in his inaugural address, took for his subject ‘The training of the will,” and said 
that success in life depended more on the will than on the intellect. Scholarship must 
sometimes beg for bread, because it is crippled by a defective will. The man of fine 
intellect without will power is like a locomotive without steam, helpless, even if on 
the right track; but a strong will needs the guiding light of intelligence to direct its 
energies. Superintendent MacAlister, of Philadelphia, said that at all hazards, by 
persuasion or compulsion, the whole people, American and foreign, black and white, 
must be educated for citizenship, and the common school is the instrument provided 
forthe purpose. The great need of our educational system to-day he held to be sim- 
plification, unloading school courses of superfluities that make them heavy, and mak- 
ing sure of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Among the other subjects brought be- 
fore the association were “ eading in our public schools,” “Our normal schools and. 
their defects,” ‘‘ Indian education,” ‘‘ Culture derived from science,” “ Scientific tem- 
perance in our public schools,” ‘“ Defects in our system of graded schools,” ‘‘ The 
principles and philosophy of teaching,” and ‘The next step.” State Superintendent 
E. E. Higbee took for the subject of the closing address the three great factors, the 
common schools, academic and collegiate institutions, and professional or technical 
schools. 
The association held its thirtieth annual meeting at Meadville, July 8-11, 1884, 
with 450 members present, President S. A. Baer in the chair. The subject of the 
president’s inaugural address was ‘‘ Education and labor,” showing that labor is the 
source of all wealth and prosperity. The speaker strongly advocated physical train- 
ing, as every measure of strength added to the arm of the laborer adds to his efficiency 
and happiness. He said much could be done in the public schools in the way of mus- 
cular development, and that we want a regular system of physical training, from a 
scientific standpoint, with the view of developing symmetry of form and strength of 
body. A paper on ‘Temperance in public schools,” forwarded by the Woman’s 
Christian Temperance Union, was read, and among the subjects which followed were 
“The new education,” ‘‘ Education at the South,” ‘‘ Boys and girls, or the pendulum 
of life,” “Light and sight,” and “Literary spirit in our schools.” The closing ad- 
dress was delivered by State Superintendent E. E. Higbee, entitled ‘Minister of edu- 
cation.” 
The papers and addresses at both these meetings were so generally interesting and 
effective that it is with regret they cannot be more fully reported here. The full re- 
ports of them in the Pennsylvania School Journal for September, 1883 and 1884, will 
be found well worthy of perusal.

. STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistical summary for 1883-84, presenting a pleasing contrast to that of the 
previous year, shows that with an increase of only 459 in school population there were 
2,970 more enrolled in the public schools and 2,194 more in average daily attendance,
-P-A-G-E-515
RHODE ISLAND, 243 
with 91 more teachers, a large proportion of them with normal school, high school, 
or collegiate training. There was also some increase in the attendance upon evening 
and private schools. , This improvement was doubtless brought about in great meas-} 
ure by the compulsory education law, noted further on. In 1883~84 schools were 
tang! t 184 days in 969 rooms for study and recitation, an increase of 40 rooms, Even- 
ing schools were open 64 evenings during the year and 145 pupils enrolled in them also 
attended the day schools, The value of public school property increased, expendi- 
tures dimivished, and the pay of teachers remained about the same. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The general supervision of the public schools is vested in a State board of educa- 
tion; a State commissioner of public schools, chosen annually by the board, acts as 
its secretary The school committee of each town consists of 3 residents of the town 
elected for 3 years, with annual change of 1. A town may elect a superintendent 
of schools annually; if it fail to do’so he may be appointed by the school committee. 
For e district 1 or 2 trustees may be elected annuully by the people. The public 
schools are free to all resident citizens.of the State without regard to age, race, or 
color. The system includes the education and training of deaf-mutes, of the blind, 
and of the feeble-minded. Any one employing a child under 15 years of age in work 
that prevents attendance upon school is rane as well as the parent or guardian 
of the child, to a penalty of $20 for each offence. Corporal punishment is permitted 
in the publi¢ schools, but is seldom inflicted, Any child between the ages of 6 and 
16 years convicted of habitual truancy may, at the discretion of the court, be fined 
$20 or committed to the industrial school in the city of Providence,      
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
To support public schools the sum of $90,000 is paid annually from the income of a 
permanent school tund and from other money in the treasury, on the order of the com- 
missioner of public schools, the money to be used for the payment of teachers only, 
No town may receive any part of the State appropriation unless it raises by tax for the 
support of public schools a sum equal to the amount it receives from the treasur 
for this purpose. There is an annual appropriation of $3,000 to purchase works of ref- 
erence and other apparatus for the schools. Means four the maintenance of evening 
schools are also provided. Towns may vote such additional sums ag they deem nec- 
essary for the sppport ofschools, purchase of sites, erection and repair of school-houses, 
and maintenance of school libraries, Any town having established a free public library 
may, by vote of electors therein, appropriate 20 cents on each $1,000 of its ratable 
property for the support of such library; also, the State board may make an appropria- 
tion annually, at the rate of $50 for the first 500 volumes in such library and $25 for 
every additional 500, The board may also allow $500 annually for teachers’ institutes, 
$500 for aiding in training in industrial art, and $300 for distributing educational pub- 
lications and providing lectures on educational topics and other means of promoting 
education, 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
A new compulsory school law went into effect October 1, 1883, looking toward the 
correction of absenteeism and truancy. The responsibility for non-attendance at school 
is placed upon the parent or guardian; for truancy, upon the truants themselves. All 
children 7 to 15 years old are required to attend school at least 12 weeks in each year, 
6 of which must be consecutive; if found guilty of habitual truancy they must be sent 
to the Sockanosset School tor Boys or to the Oak Lawn School forGirls, at Cranston, 
for a period not exceeding two years, Truant officers are appointed annually to notify 
offending parties of the offence committed and the penalty therefor, and if they can 
secure satisfactory pledges for proper compliance with the law they may forbear to 
prosecute so long as such pledges are kept. 
A law enacted April 24, 184, requires all school committees to make provision 
for instructing pupils in all public schools in physiology and hygiene, with special 
reference to the effects of alcoholic liquors, and other stimulants, and narcotics upon 
the human system. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF TOWNS WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. e 
This is by school committees of 3 or more members, divided into 3 classes, with 
annual change of one-third, and by a superintendent chosen by the people or the 
committee,

@ The above statistics (except the population) are taken, for uniformity, from the State reports for 
1883 and 1884. The figures are for the school year closing in March of each year, with the exception 
of those showing the enumeration of children of school age, which are only brought up to December of each year. The figures from written returns, differing at some points from these, may be found in 
Table Il of the appendix. 6 A return gives 13,140. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Lincoln during 1882~83 was reported to be in the front rank of towns having a 
large percentage of children not attending school and its school committee urged a 
ready compliance with the new law relating to compulsory education. The report for 
1884 says this law has been accepted in good faith; truant officers have been chosen 
and have attended to their duties. Besides the number attending public schools, 
there was reported in Roman Catholic and select schools a sufficient number to make 
pou 72 per cent. of the school population under instruction during the year in all 
schools. 
Newport for 1883~84 reports 12 school buildings, with 45 rooms and 2,447 sittings 
for study, all valued at $151,939. The schools were taught 196 days by 8 men and 51 
women, including 2 special teachers of music and drawing. The system embraced 
primary, intermediate, grammar, high, evening, ungraded, and Kindergarten schools. 
Particular pains are taken to give systematic instruction in morals and manners, 
suitable reference books upon the subject being placed upon each teacher's desk. The 
high school course covers 4 years and includes Greek, Latin, French, German, and 
higher English ; pupils enrolled in it during the year, 139, an increase of 6 over the 
preceding year. 
Pawtucket in 1883~84 reported that two new public school buildings were erected 
during the year and one enlarged, at a cost of $24,175. The schools continued to be 
primary, intermediate, grammar, and high and were taught 197 days by 23 men and 67 
women, with 1 special teacher of music. The 5 evening schools had 667 boys and 312 
girls, and were open, with one exception, for 14 weeks. The numberof pupils was greater 
than ever before. The evening drawing school was well attended and did excellent 
work. As there were reported 30,994 daysof absence and 5,519 cases of tardiness, the 
superintendent recommends the appointment of a truant officer and the enforcement of 
the new compulsory education law ; he further urges that the physical training of 
children be confined to the home, so as not to interfere with the 5 hours specially ap- 
propriated to study, and that in place of some of the higher school training atten- 
tion be directed to subjects connected with industrial and mechanical pursuits. 
Providence in 1883-84 reported that the schools were taught 200 days, a special 
teacher of music was employed, and evening schools were maintained, with a total 
registration of 2,043 and an average belonging of 1,272, at a cost of $12,207. 
ev. Daniel Leach, since 1855 the faithful superintendent of the city schools, retired 
at the close of the school year 1883-84, and in the session following the school com-

  mittee secured the services of Hon. Horace Tarbell, former State superintendent of 
the schools of Michigan and for several succeeding years superintendent of the city 
schools of Indianapolis, Ind. 
Warwick in 1882~83 had 18 graded and 10 ungraded public schools, the average 
length of term being 9 months and 2 days. Of the 35 teachers employed in public 
schools, 13 were educated at academies or high schools, 15 at normal, and 7 in com- 
mon schools. 
The statistics for 1883~84 show an increase in the public school enrolment and a 
decrease in the number not attending any school. The public school term was 9 
months and 5 days, a slight increase, and the average monthly pay of teachers was 
about $1.50 more than in 188283. 
Woonsocket iu 1883~84 reported 14 school buildings, with 36 rooms for study, val- 
ued, with all other school property, at $146,470. The schools were taught 193 days 
and are graded as primary, grammar, and high. The superintendent urges that a 
special teacher of music be employed to give instruction in all these schools; also, 
that more attention be given~to training in morals and manners. Corporal punish- 
ment is administered less frequently, and the best teachers, as a rule, resort to it least. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
Teachers must give satisfactory evidence of having a thorough knowledge of com. 
mon English branches, the examination being conducted by the school committee, 
who test the capacity of applicants to teach any grade of school. In granting cer- 
tificates some reference may be had to the condition and wants of the particular 
schools for which the candidates are presented. Teachers must also be qualified to 
govern and to impart instruction. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State Normal School, Providence, requires for admission an examination in 
the common English branches, except in the case of high school graduates. A 3-year 
course of instruction, to take the place of the 2-year course, was adopted in 1884, in 
which English studies are pursued. An advanced course is also offered, including 
Greek, Latin, French, German, mathematics, and natural sciences. The public 
schools of Providence furnish to students in the senior class opportunity for observa- 
tion and practice teaching. Tuition is free to pupils who intend to teach in the pub- 
lic scapes of the State. ‘The whole number of students in 1863~84 was 160; gradu- 
ates, 9. 
Several improvements were made in the arrangements of the school building to in- 
crease the comfort and convenience of pupils. More time than previously had been 
given to music, and with satisfactory results, a number who Hed supposed that they 
possessed no musical ability have found that the subject was within their grasp, 
The State commissioner reports the school in excellent condition. Certain modi- 
fications made during the year in the course of study had resulted in a decided im- 
provement of the health of pupils. The attendance was never so good as during the 
year under review. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State provides institute training for teachers by appropriating $500 annually 
for that purpose, the institutes to be under the direction of the commissioner of pub- 
lie schools. Two very successful institutes were held during 188384, one at New- 
port, designed especially for the teachers of that county; the other at Wakefield, 
for Washington County. At the first named, every town in the county but one was 
pores need j; at the last, every one, and an unusual degree of enthusiasm was man- 
ifested. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Schools of this class were reported at Bristol, Newport, Pawtucket, Providence, 
Reading, Warren, Woonsocket, and other places. The Rogers High School, Newport, 
enrolled 139 pupils in 1883~84, an increase of 7 over the preceding year. The instruc- 
tion here in Greck, Latin, mathematics, and physics, includes all that is required for 
admission to the best colleges. The school at Westerly was larger in 1883~84 
than ever before, having increased 55 per cent. in3 years, and that at Warren has 
never done more practical work than during that year. South. Kingston reports 
her high school to be gradually gaining ground and to have already become one of the

indispensable institutions of the town, and Woonsocket has a bigh school which is 
justly said to be the pride of its citizens. 
OTHER SECCNDARY SCHOOLS, 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and schools preparatory to | 
college, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix to this volume. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
BROWN UNIVERSITY. 
Brown University, Providence, for young men only, presents 3 courses of 4 years 
each, the first leading to the degree of a. B.-and the second and third to that of PH. B., 
one of these including Greek or Latin. Students may, pursue a select course without 
entering as candidates fora degree. The university, in i883~84 had an enrolment of 
248 students, under 20 instructors. The degree of a. B. was conferred upon 46 grad- 
uates; that of PH. B.,on7; and that of A.M., on 18 graduates of former classes. 
Benefactions received from April, 1883, to February, 1885, were $50,000 from the ex- 
ecutors of Gardner Colby, of Newton, Mass.; $12,500 from the estate of Hon. H. B. 
Anthony, of Providence; $1,000 from the estate of William Latham, of Bridgeport, 
Mass. ; about 14 acres of land from Mrs. Metcalf, valued at $75,000 ; and a subscription 
of $50,000 for repairing university hall. Whole amount, $188,500. 
‘The president pes that it is every day becoming more and morejapparent that 
a larger number of electives should be offered, especially in branches of natural sci- 
ence and modern languages; also, that greatly enlarged accommodations should be 
provided for those wishing to take advanced courses in applied science, the numbers 
of such students being greatly in excess of the capacity of the college. He says, 
further, that the freshman class entering in 1834 included an unusual number of can- 
didates for the degree of B. PH., constituting, in fact, more than one-fourth of the 
candidates for degrees, not one of whom took Greek and only a few Latin. The pro- 
portion of candidates for this degree in the graduating class of 1884 was only one- 
ninth, and this difference, it is thought, shows plainly the drift of public sentiment 
towards what is called a more practical education, 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The departments of practical science in Brown University still continued in 188384 
to afford special preparation in the mechanical and physical sciences and their ap- 
plication to the industrial arts. The regular course in civil engineering covers 4 
years, but a longer or shorter one may be pursued, according to the wants and abili- 
ties of students. The course in agriculture includes chemistry and physics, botany, 
physiology, zodlogy, comparative anatomy, and special lectures in agriculture, 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No professional schools were reported in the State in 1883~84, 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 
The Rhode Island School for the Deaf, Providence, founded in 1877, is under the 
control of the State board of education; it had during the year 1884 a total at- 
tendance of 12 boys and 18 girls. The more advanced pupils are tanght the higher 
branches of education, with drawing and painting, but the English language is con- 
sidered of the first importance. Special attention is given to lip reading and articu- 
lation. Tuition is free to residents of the State and provision is made for defraying 
the expenses of indigent pupils. 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, continued to give instruction in 
freehand and mechanical drawing, painting in oil and water colors, and modelling 
in olay Day and evening classes are maintained; also, a Saturday morning children’s 
class for those that are in other schools during the. week. The instruction is made

practically useful to mechanics, and includes geometric and perspective drawing; 
orthographic projection; descriptive geometry; projection of shadows; mechanical, 
object, model, and design drawing; oil painting; and china decoration, The number 
instructed in the school in 188283 was: Day pupils, 48; evening pupils, 134; in the 
Saturday morning class, 47. . 
STATE HOME AND SCHOOL FOR INDIGENT CHILDREN. 
In accordance with an act of the general assembly authorizing such action, a site 
was purchased in 1884 for a home for neglected children. The site chosen contains 44 
acres of land in Providence, with a mansion house, cottages, barn, and other buildings. 
The school is to be similar in plan and scope to that at Coldwater, Mich., of which 
the prominent features are the separation of innocent from criminal children and ed- 
ucation in a temporary home by the State, succeeded by permanent homes in families 
as soon as children are fitted for them. It has been decided to adopt the “cottage 
plan,” each cottage, fitted up for 25 inmates, to be under the special care and direction 
of a woman, the ‘cottage manager;” the cooking and dining rooms are to be in the 
ceutral building. The officers in charge of the whole school will be a superintendent 
and matron, 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Rhode Island State Reform School, Howard, established in 1850, received 194 
children in the year ending December 31, 1883, and discharged 159, leaving in the 
school at the end of the year 173 boys (of whom 16 were colored), under 14 teachers 
and other officers. ‘Boys are committed between the ages of 10 and 21, and up to 
1883 3,467 had been under instruction and training here since the school was founded. 
The common school branches are taught, with singing and band music, and such in- 
dustries as chair making, gardening, farming, house and laundry work, and tailor- 
ing. A library of 1,400 volumes is connected with the school, 100 books having been 
added during the year. Expenditure for the year, $29,031. )   
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
RHODE ISLAND INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION. 
The thirty-ninth annual meeting of the institute was held in Providence, January 
24-26, 18e4, Mr. W. T. Peck presiding. 
The morning of the first day was spent in visiting the schools of the city and the 
afternoon was given to meetings of the different departments of the institute. In the 
higher department papers were read on ‘‘The natural method of studying history,” 
“The teacher and the pupil after graduation,” ‘‘The moral and religious element in 
education,” ‘‘ Utility in high school work,” ‘‘ Wasteof energy,” and ‘‘ High school exhi- 
bitions;” the prevailing sentiment in all being a desire for more practical and thorough 
work in the high schools. The importance of encouraging study for its own sake and 
for the culture and knowledge obtained, rather than to enable the student successfully 
to pass his examinations, was strongly urged, In the grammar department an essay 
was read on ‘Some of nature’s helps to teaching,” reference being had chiefly to object 
lesson methods. Another, on ‘Cultivation of thought and expression in children,” 
seemed the complement of the first. Both insisted on such instruction as would arouse 
independent thought. In the evening, after musical performances by pupils of the 
high school which showed excellent training, the audience listened to an eloquent 
address by President Carter, of Williams College, on ‘‘ One or two elements of good 
teaching. 
The exercises of the second day were opened by an address from President Peck, 
entitled ‘‘Is teaching a profession?” The next paper, ‘The teachers in the common 
schools,” was a continuation of the same topic, as was also the next, entitled “Growth 
after graduation.” A paper followed on ‘‘Moral training and school government,” 
by Mr. J. T. Prince, agent of the Massachusetts board of education, and one on ‘School 
work” closed the exercises of the afternoon. In the evening the institute was ad- 
dressed by A. O. Bourn, governor of the State, who, after reviewing the changes which 
inventions and discoveries have made in business and consequently in the require- 
ments of education, closed by urging on teachers the duty of impressing on their 
pupils a belief in the dignity of labor. An address followed on “Methods ;” then came 
one, largely retrospective, from Rev. J. T. Edwards, D. D., who was president of the 
institute fourteen years ago; then Hon. T. W. Bicknell, president of the National Ed- 
ucational Association, discussed the work of that body, referred to the coming meeting 
in Mailison, and gave a cheerful picture of the progress of education throughout the 
country, especially in the West and South. 
The final session of the institute was largely attended, the andience including 150 
pupils from the public schools, After music by them, Prof, H. E. Holt, instructor of

music in the Boston public schools, gave a lecture, illustrated by a class, showing 
how children should be taught to think in music. A paper on “The great Northwest” 
followed, and then one on “ Literature and the schools,” closing the program. 
Among the resolutions adopted by the association was one aflirming the importance 
of enforcing the truancy law, one urging the necessity for more definite moral in- 
struction in the schools (including the subject of temperance), and another calling for 
the appointment of a State board of examination for teachers.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The two years under review present progress in nearly all the vital items relating 
to the public schools. In 1882~’83 there was an increase of 27,121 in enrolment, of 86 
in schools, of 104 in school-houses, and of 81 in teachers, over 1881~82. Going back 
a few years, the State superintendent says, the successive waves of increase, each 
year (with few exceptions) reaching higher, show that the tide of popular feeling in 
favor of the system is moving well on to the flood. For 1883-84, however, he reports 
the presence of adverse circumstances in the short and unremunerative crops of 183, 
the severity of the winter, the delay and siienley 4 in planting the crops of the cur- 
rent year, the unusual stringency in money, and the discussion of the policy of Fede- 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
  250 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER Os’ HOUCATION. 
ral aid, which revived into active expression all the latent opposition to the common 
school system of the State. And yet, the statistics show continued progress in enrol- 
ment, an increase of 12,524, gaining 4.77 per cent. over 1882~’83; and in average daily 
attendance an increase of 3,148, that attendance being 61.49 per cent. of the enrolment. 
There is also evidence of progress in the fact that there were 6 more school districts, 
213 more schools, 135 more public school-houses, 65 more owned by districts, 17 more 
new ones, and 190 more teachers employed. 
The relation of the two races to the schools presents an interesting feature. The 
census of 1880 shows a continuance of the large preponderance of colored youth over 
the white, noticed in preceding years. This appears again in the enrolment and at- 
tendance of the years under review. In 1852~’83 against 74,157 whites enrolled there 
were 98,938 colored, or 24,781 more colored than white. In 1883~’84 against 84,028 
whites there appear 101,591 colored, 17,563 more colored than white. 
As respects the increase of attendance in the schools, the Statesuperintendent speaks 
with very reasonable gratification. Assuming that the school population of the State 
was 283,000 in 1884, he makes the per cent. of enrolment, on that basis, 65.50 of the 
whole number of school youth. The figures in the preceding table, as may be seen, 
fairly justify his estimate, for, with the United States Census number of 262,279 school 
youth, the per cent. of enrolment in the State schools was in 1883~84 70.77, which 
exceeds considerably the like percent. of such highly estimated States as New Jersey, 
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois in 1882.’ Advance to such a point in ea 
ucational matters in a State so impoverished as South Carolina was at the conclusion 
of the war is highly creditable. . 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The geveral educational interests of the State are committed to a State superin- 
tendent of education, elected by the people for 2 years, and to a State board of exam- 
iners, composed of the State superintendent and 4 others appointed biennially by the 
governor. Each county has a school commissioner, elected biennially by the people; 
a county board of examiners, including the commissioner, as chairman and clerk, 
with 2 others appointed by the State board for 2-year terms. Districts have 3 trust- 
ees, appointed for 2 years by the county boards. The State board of examiners pre- 
scribes the course of study in the free public schools, and also selects a uniform series 
of text books for use in the same, to continue for 5 years, except in the city of Charles- 
ton. The board also makes rules for the examination of teachers and prescribes a 
standard of proficiency, which shall entitle applicants to certificates of qualification 
as teachers. It is the duty of each county commissioner to have general supervision 
of the schools, school-houses, and school furniture in his county, to aid the teachers 
in efforts to improve in their profession, and to report to the State superintendent by 
October 1 in each year, failing to do which last, he forfeits one-fourth of his pay 
for that year. When so advised by the county board, he may apportion from the in- 
come of the 2-mill tax $200 to defray the expenses of legally conducted teachers’ insti- 
tutes. County boards of examiners and boards of trustees are required to see that in 
every school under their care there be taught the usual school branches, with history 
of the United States and of the State, the principles of the Constitution and laws of 
the United States and of the State, morals, and good behavior. District trustees are 
required to provide suitable school-houses for their districts, to take care of school 
property, suspend or dismiss pupils when deemed necessary, visit the schools, and see 
that they are kept according to law and with the utmost efficiency. Each county 
board may limit the school term according to the schoo] fund of his county. County 
commissioners apportion the income of the school fund among the districts of their 
county according to’ the average attendance of the last preceding year. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are sustained.from the proceeds of a tax of 2 mills on $1 anda 
oll tax of $1 on each voter. This fund is to provide for the free education of all youth 
in the State 6 to 16 years of age without distinction of race or color. 
PEABODY FUND. 
In 1883 the State received from the Peabody fund $2,000 for the public schools, $825 
for teachers’ institutes, and $1,400 in Nashville scholarships; in all, $4,225. 
In 1884 there were received from that fund $2,300 for the public schools, $1,000 for 
teachers’ institutes, and $1,100 in Nashville scholarships; in all, $4,400, Four vacan- 
cies in the scholarships at Nashville Normal College were filled. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The following among other changes were made in the school law in 1884: The salary 
of the State superintendent was raised $100 and $300 were allowed for clerk hire; 
provision was made for the expenses of teachers’ institutes; county commissioners

were allowed travelling expenses while visiting schools, but not to exceed $100,a year; 
and an allowance of $3 a day for five days each year was made for the services of county 
examiners. 
\ 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The public schools of Charleston are governed by a board of 10 commissioners, 
6 elected by the people, the others appointed by the governor. The board, as before 
the act of 1882, chooses a superintendent, and, in other respects, retains its former 
duties and powers. 
The city of Columbia, by Jaw of 1880 and subsequent amendments, became a sepa- 
rate school district, with 4 wards, and its public schools were placed under the éon- 
trol of a board of 7 commissioners, 4 elected by the people, 1 by the city council from 
its own number, and 2 avpointed by the governor. The board appoints a superin- 
tendent. 
STATISTIOS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Charleston, by census of 1860, had a population of 49,984; in 1883 public schools, 
classed as primary, grammar, high, and city normal, were taught by 100 teachers and 
had an enrolment of 4,055 and an average daily attendance of 3,662, or 90.3 per cent. of 
the enrolment. Of those enrolled 2,000 were colored. Superintendent Simons reports 
few changes, and these mostly in improvements of school buildings, of which there were 
18 in 1883~84, valued at $188,000, The gradesin 4 of the schools were raised, the high 
school having introduced geometry, chemistry, and astronomy. The Catholics in 
1882~83 had 6 parochial schools, with 27 teachers and 1,043 enrolled. These schools 
are said to be practical and efficient and annually increasing. 
Columbia, by census of 1880, hada population of 10,036; in 1883~84, a school popu- 
lation of 2,160; an enrolment of 1,493, being 69 per cent. of school youth; an average 
daily attendance of 864, being 57.87 per cent. of enrolment. Schools are classed as 
primary and grammar. For these there were 19 teachers, 3 school buildings, with 
857 sittings, less than the average daily attendance; but 160 additional sittings were 
provided during the second term. School property was valued at $29,944. The 
schools were in session as free schools but 7 months, the public money being then ex- 
hausted. They were continued 2 months longer by subscription, thus making a full 
session of 9 months. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 150, 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
Any person passing a satisfactory examination by the State board of examiners re- 
ceives a certificate entitling him to teach in any free public school in the State for 
2 years, which may be renewed with or without examination, at the discretion of the 
board. County boards of examiners are required annually to examine candidates for 
teaching, and to give to each found qualified a certiticate setting forth the branches 
he or she may be capable of teaching. No teacher may be employed in any of the free 
public schools without a certificate from either a county or the State board of exam- 
iners or from one of the faculties of the State normal institutes, the last being valid 
for 3 years. To such students as have attended three normal institutes, diplomas of 
authority to teach in the State without further examination may be granted. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING.    
There are two State normal institutes, one for white, the other for colored teach- 
ers. The South Carolina State normal for white teachers held its fifth annual gses- 
sion at Spartanburg July 15 to August 14, 1834. The program embraced nearly all 
the subjects of public school instruction, and a model school with 9 instructors was 
provided. The work is said to have been done with ability and success. There were 
enrolled 227, of whom 146 were teachers and 81 were preparing to teach, 
The annual session of the State normal for colored teachers was held at Orange- 
burg July 2-29, 1884, with an enrolment of 63 teachers under 6 instructors and a pro- 
gram similar to that of the white institute, this also had a model school. 
At Claflin University, Orangeburg, one of the three institutions that go to form the 
University of South Carolina, the 3-year normal course for colored students, noticed 
in former reports, was continued, with an attendance of 100 pupils in buth 1882~83, 
and 1833~84. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
There -were 5 other normal schools and departments reporting in 1883-84: The 
normal department of Schofield Normal and Industrial School, Aiken; the Avery 
Normal Institute, Charleston, sustained by the American Missionary Association (Con-

gepgationsl); the normal department of Brainard University, Chester; sustained 
by the Presbyterian Board of Missions for Freedmen; the normal department of Allen 
University, Columbia (African Methodist Episcopal), and Fairfield Normal Institute, 
Winnsboro’, the last sustained by the Presbyterian Board of Missions for Freedmen. 
All these schools are for the training of colored teachers of either sex, with courses 
of 3 and 4 years. For their statistics, see Table [II of the appendix. 
TEACHERS INSTITUTES. 
County institutes were held during the year in Abbeville, Chester, Darlington, 
Edgefield, and Fairfield Counties, obsdtar and Darlington having each two insti- 
tutes, one for white, the other for colored teachers. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report for 1883~’84 makes no mention ofthe existence of high schools, 
giving only the statement that in 1883 4,515 and in 1884. 4,721 pupils studied the 
higher branches. The State superintendent reports a growing feeling in favor of 
graded schools, awakened by the success of the graded schools of Columbia. Spar- 
pan buen inaugurating a similar system, as were also the colored people of Orangé* 
burg. e also reports 101 schools of a lower grade than colleges not connected with 
the public school system, with an attendance of 6,458. Charleston reports two high 
schools, one of which in 1883 enrolled 327 girls and in 1884 had an average of 275; 
the other, in 1883, enrolled 167 boys, and in 1884, about the same number. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For further statistics of private academic schools, preparatory schools, and prepara- 
pony. departments of colleges reporting, see Tables VI, VII, and» IX of the appendix; 
and for summaries of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of South Carolina, as organized in 1880, includes the South Carolina 
College, Columbia; Claflin University, Orangeburg; and the South Carolina Mili- 
tary Academy, Charleston. 
The South Carolina College, for educating white young men of the State, reports for 
1883-84 a faculty of 13 professors and instructors, with 5 parallel courses, of 4 years 
each, for degrees, and as many of two years that bring nodegree. The degree courses 
are in (1) classical literature, (2) Latin and modern literature, (3) general science, (4) 
mechanics and engineering, and (5) agriculture and applied chemistry. The special 
courses, leading to no degree, are in agriculture, English studies, studies preparatory 
for medicine and pharmacy, a course for teachers, and one in science. In the 2-year 
classes there were reported 18 students; in the 4-year classes, 143, while 8 graduates, 
11 students in elective studies, and 22 subcollegiates made a total of 202. The college 
has a library of 27,000 volumes. 
Claflin University, for the education of colored pupils of either sex, offers classical and 
scientific courses of 4 years each, a normal course of 3 years, a college preparatory 
course of 3 years, and a grammar school course of 2 years. In 1883~84 there were 11 
professors and instructors, with 2 superintendents of an industrial department, and 
424. students, of whom 17 were collegiate. 
South Carolina Military Academy, Charleston, was reopened as a department of the 
State University October 1, 1882, according to an act passed June 1 of that year. For 
details, see Scientific and Professsional Instruction, further on. 
The regular courses of Allen University and of Charleston, Erskine, Adger, and 
Newberry Colleges are preparatory, of 2 to 3 years, and collegiate, of 4 years, with 
others noted under normal schools or to be noted under Scientific and Professional In- 
struction, further on. Furman University and Wofford College group their studies 
under independent schools, the former having 7, the latter 9, embracing the usual col- 
legiate studies. 
For statistics of the above institutions, see Table IX of the appendix; for sum- 
mip ties of the same, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Williamston College, since 1877, has modified its plan of study and differs from most 
schools of its kind. The college year is divided into 9 sections of 5 weeks each, one 
of which is devoted to one of the 4 departments in the course of study, each student 
giving special attention to one principal subject for5 weeks. Commencement days are 
pped, each student graduating on completion of the full course. Instead of prizes

‘or excellence in scholarship, a discount of 10 to'50 per cent. is allowed from the sec- 
tion tuition fee to those whose report for any section averages from 85 to 88, up to 97 
to 100. The plan is said to work well, the students unanimously preferring it to the 
old system. 
For statistics of 6 institutions for the superior instruction of young women report- ' 
ing (all authorized by law to confer collegiate degrees), see Table VIII of the ap- 
pendix ; for a summary of same, a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
‘SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, a department of the 
South Carolina College, is for the education of young white men of the State. It 
offers courses of general science, mechanics and engineering, and agriculture and 
chemistry, each of 4 years, and also shorter ones in science and agriculture, each of 
2 years. There are 30 acres of land, on which experiments testing different vari- 
eties of cereals and the effects of different fertilizers were in progress, and several 
hundred varieties of fruit trees and small fruits were planted. The trustecs declare 
their intention to give prominence to the work of this department of the college. 
The South Carolina Agricultural College and Mechanics’ Institute, at Orangeburg, is 
for the education of colored students, and has a farm of 150 acres, cultivated largely 
by student labor, by which many nearly support themselves. It is supported prin- 
cipally by the income from the sale of lands granted by the United States for the en- 
couragement of industrial education. Its scientific course covers 4 years. The me- 
chanical department has been organized by an appropriation from the State fund, 
and shops with the necessary machinery are soon to be ready. 
The South Carolina Military Academy, Charleston, groups its studies under five 
courses of 4 years each: (1), Mathematics and engineering; (2) physical science; 
(3) history, belles letters, and ethics; (4) modern languages, and (5) military science 
and tactics. Each county of the State was entitled for 1882~’83 and 1883~84 to two 
beneficiary cadets, to be maintained and educated at the public expense. All stu- 
dents are received on a probation of 3 months; if found unsuitable, they are dismissed. 
The academic year is from October 1 to August 1, with semiannual and annual ex- 
aminations. 
For statistics of the above scientific schools, see Table X of the appendix; for a 
summary of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological instruction continues to be given in the Baker Theological Institute, 
connected with Claflin University, Orangeburg (Methodist Episcopal) ; in the theo- 
logical department of Allen University, Columbia (Methodist Episcopal), in a 3-year 
course; in the Benedict Institute, Columbia (Baptist), in a course of 3 years; and in 
the Theological Seminary of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian. Church South, 
Columbia, the last, reopened in 1882 after having been closed for several years, having 
a full course of 3 years and a library of 23,000 volumes. 
For statistics of the above, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Legal. —The law department of Allen University, Columbia, offers the usual 2-year 
course of instruction to students desiring to pursue the study of law. In 1883~84 it 
had 1 professor and 1 instructor, with 5 students, 4 graduating with the degree of 
LL. B. 
Medical.—The Medical College of the State of South Carolina, Charleston, reports 
for 1883~84 a faculty of 7 professors, with 6 other instructors. A graded course of 
study is recommended, but not required. There are no requirements for admission, 
but for graduation there are required 3 years of study, attendance on 2 full lecture 
courses of 20 weeks each, and a final satisfactory examination. In 1883~84 there were 
20 graduates in medicine and 3 in pharmacy out of a matriculation of 80, 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The South Carolina Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Cedar Spring, 
has for the deaf-mutes 2 teachers of the sign system and 1 for the oral; for the blind, 
2 teachers for the literary, musical, and tuning departments. In school the deaf are 
taught the elementary branches prepared especially for them, besides biblical and 
general literature, articulation, and lip reading. The blind, beyond the elementary 
studies, are instructed in English literature, geography (with map lessons), history, 
natural philosophy, rhetoric, algebra, geometry, Latin, biblical and general literature, 
yocal and instrumental music, and tuning. For industries, the boys have shoemak-

ing, printing, broom, brush, and mattress making and chair seating; the girls, house, 
kitchen, and laundry work, plain sewing, knitting, and fancy work in beads, wool, 
and cotton. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
There are two institutions for the education of orphans in South Carolina, of which 
a few interesting facts are given: The Thornwell Orphanage, Clinton, in 1883 closed 
its eighth year with 4 teachers and 50 inmates. It is under the care of the Presby- 
terian Church South, and is supported by contributions, from a part of which an 
increasing endowment fund is created. From a building fund an orphan seminary 
was built during the year, while the current expenses were paid from a fund for its sup- 
port. Income from all sources, $2,771, A collegiate course for the girls is in view, 
and for the boys, a farm, workshop, and printing office have been introduced. The 
school is the main feature of the orphanage, which has a library of 897 volumes, 
The Holy Communion Church Institute, an excellent bigh grade school for boys, con- 
tinues to advance its standard of education and increase its numbers. In 1883 there 
were 203 boys, with 100 in the day school ; in 1884, 216 boys in the institnte and 104 
in the day school. A large 4-story building for dining rooms and dormitories was 
erected during 1883 ; also, a chapel, seating 550, at a cost of $21,335. Total expendi- 
ture for the year, $60,058, nearly $18,000 of which was raised at home, the balance. 
abroad, 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
The information as to these means of improving teachers is far from being as explicit 
as could be desired. In July, 1881, the first State Normal Institute for Colored Teach- 
ers, held at Columbia with an attendance of 185, was made by the teachers an occa- 
sion for the organization of the first State Teachers’ Association of their race ever 
organized in America. This association held its third annual session also at Colum- 
bia, July 12-17, 1483, when it claimed a membership of 225, presented an excellent 
scheme of studies, a constitution and by-laws for itself, and a form of constitution for 
county teachers’ associations, which were adopted. The proceedings of that session 
were very an earnestly and exceedingly creditable to those engaged in them, but were 
too full to he detailed here, The subjects treated were ‘The free school as the cor- 
ner stone of republican institutions;” “Novel reading,” as having its two sides of 
vileness and of healthfal interest; ‘The illiteracy problem in South Carolina;” and 
“A cultured womanhood the beacon light of christian civilization.” 
In 1884, in connection with the fifth session of the State Normal Institute for . 
Whites, at Columbia, Dr. James H. Carlyle, president, and Dr, Chas. F, Smith, of 
Vanderbilt University, lecturer, seyeral sessions of the State Teachers’ Association 
are said to have been held in the evenings, when measures were taken for the 
better organization of the association, for the formation of auxiliary associations in 
the counties, and for the publication of a State journal of education. As Mr.D, B. 
Johnson, of Columbia, the white superintendent of schools in that place, was chosen 
president for the ensuing year and as the institute was for whites, it is inferred that 
this second association is one for the white teachers of the State, and that it will be 
heard from as such.

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The report from this State for 188182 showed a falling off in the number of school 
youth to be instructed and a large decrease in the number brought under instruction 
both in private and public schools. From that time of decline there appears now a 
great reaction in a school system full of vigorous life. In 1882~’83 school youth pre- 
sented an advance of 12,290; while attendance in public schools rose from 264,356 to 
327,231, making this attendance 58.28 per cent. of the whole number of school age in 
the State; the number of pupils in all schools rose from 290,504 to 359,134, and aver- 
age attendance in all schools was 34.97 per cent. of the whole number entitled to in- 
struction. 
In 1883~84, as may be seen from the statistical summary preceding, this great 
increase still went on, school youth being 23,895 more numerous, enrolment of these 
in public schools 22,912 greater, and average daily attendance 29,675 more than 
in 18¢2~83, an increase of 3.79 per cent. in this respect within a year. Adding to this 
the average attendance in private and church schools shows a total of 232,868 youth 
daily in the different schools, an increase of 36,488 within a year, or 39.78 per cent. 
of all school youth brought under instruction during the average school term. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For general supervision there is a State superintendent of public schools, nominated 
biennially by the governor and confirmed by thesenate ; for local supervision, a super- 
intendent for each county is chosen by the county court biennially; and in each dis- 
trict there are 3 directors, elected by the people for 3 years, one going out each year. 
The law requires State and county superintendents to be persons of literary and sci-. 
entific attainments and of skill and experience in the art of teaching. The public 
schools are free to all youth of school age (6-21), but separate schools must be main- 
tained for white and colored. The studies in them include only the ordinary branches, 
with vocal music, elementary geology of Tennessee, and elementary principles of 
agriculture, though other and higher branches may be provided for by local taxa- 
tion or be allowed by special regulations on the payment of tuition fees. The union 
of public schools with academies and colleges (allowed by law) facilitates such 
arrangements. The establishment of public high schools is encouraged when the 
population justifies it. 
  SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The entire permanent State school fund amounts to $2,512,500, and the public’ 
schools are maintained by the interest arising therefrom, by a poll tax of $1 on each 
man living in the State, and by a property tax of 1 mill on each $1, all distributed 
on the basis of scholastic population. If from these sources there should not be 
enough to sustain schools five months in the year, the county courts, of their own 
motion or following a vote of the people, may levy an additional tax to keep them 
open for that time or longer; the whole amount, however, is not to exceed the entire 
State tax. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
For cities there are boards of education elected by the people. City superintendents 
are elected by these boards.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Chattanooga reported for 1882~83 graded schools taught 168 days in 7 buildings, 
containing 26 rooms, all school property being valued at $45,000. There were 350 
pupils in private and church schools and abont 1,400 youth 6-21 not under any school 
instruction. Music and penmanship were taught, but no special teachers were em- 
ployed. All teachers who have taught for five consecutive years in the public schools 
of the city are allowed $50 extra on their yearly salary. Although there was a de- 
crease in school-houses reported the value of school property increased by $5,250. 
Knoxville in 1883~84 reported graded schools in 8 buildings, containing 41 rooms, 
with 1,805 sittings for study, considerably less than the average attendance; but 3 
buildings were added during the year, with accommodations for 445 more, children. 
The schools were taught 189 days by f3 men and 31 women, an increase of 12 teachers. 
There was also an increase in school population, enrolment, and average daily at- 
tendance. Private and church schools enrolled 250 pupils, as far as reported, leaving 
about 1,800 youth between the ages of 6 and 21 years not attending any school. The 
valuation of public school property increased during the year from $48,000 to $50,500. 
The Memphis schools in 1882~83 were in a state of progression, but attendance was 
retarded by the lack of accommodations. The superintendent said, in an interview 
published in the Memphis Appeal, that the school-houses were all full, and that, if the 
room would admit of it, the enrolment would be increased fully 2,000. : 
In 1833-84 there was an increase of 1,969 in school population, with a slight de- 
crease in enrolment. Graded schools were taught 167 days by 7 men and 61 women 
in 12 buildings, with 68 rooms for study and recitation. Four more school rooms 
were in use, though the number of buildings reported was the same. The school debt 
was reduced during the year from $15,532 to $10,185, giving a brighter outlook for the 
future. Public school property was valued at $131,400. 
Nashville shows advance at many points over 1882~83. With only 534 additional 
school youth, there were 905 more enrolled, 1,090 more in average daily attendance, 
and 11 more teachers. Two new school buildings, making 13 in all, advanced the value 
of school property to $231,000, an increase of $35,000. With this addition of buildings 
there was a gain of only about600 sittings, one of the new buildings taking the place 
of a rented one of nearly the same capacity. The large increase of attendance called 
for another building, of a seating capacity of 500 at least, for the whites; another for 
the colored; and still another, in the near future, for the high school. The schools 
were taught 187 days. The course of study in those below the high school extends 
over 4 seats including the latter, 11 years. A special course of drawing and writing 
is included. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS, 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
No person may be employed as a teacher in any public school or receive pay from 
the public funds without a certificate of qualification from his county superintendent, 
who, under the direction of the State supérintendent, examines and licenses appli- 
cants. Any officer who shall make or sanction a payment to an unlicensed teacher is 
subject to a penalty of not less than $5 nor more than $50._ The law also directs that 
for like services of male and female teachers like salaries shall be paid. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State Normal College, organized under a law of 1875, is a department of the 
State University at Nashville. It derives its support from the funds of the university, 
the Peabody educational fund, and an appropriation from the State. Itreceives stu- 
dents of either sex, and, while it is a State normal school for Tennessee, it receives 
students, mostly on Peabody scholarships, from other Southern States. 
Applicants for admission must pass an examination in grammar school studies and 
declare their determination to become teachers. The course, covering 3 years, em- 
braces a review of all the elementary studies and some in the higher branches, with 
reference to the best way of teaching them, including management of classes and 
schools, organization, and discipline, The diploma of the college includes the degree 
of licentiate of instruction, and is given to those who complete the entire course ; it 
entitles the holder to teach in any county in the State without further examination. 
Students who complete the fourth year, for more advanced studies, receive the A. B. 
degree of the university in addition to that of the regular licentiate. 
For statistics of this and 11 othernormal institutions and departments reporting for 
188384, see Table III of the appendix ; for summary of same, the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding, 
NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
Normal institutes, under the supervision of the State superintendent, were held, in 
1883~84, at Covington, for one week; at Humboldt, Lewisburg, Mont Dagle, and 
175 .

258 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Knoxville, each for one month. Three were held for colored teachers and also sev- 
“eral county institutes. All received aid from the Peabody fund. Instruction was 
given by some of the best teachers and professors in the State and much interest is 
said to have been manifested by the people and students. In several of the county 
institutes referred to, experts were employed to lecture on the most improved method 
of imparting instruction, greatly benefiting the teachers and awakening a healthier 
public sentiment in favor ot free education. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Tennessee Journal of Education, the most important educational journal in 
the State, edited by Hon. Leon. Trousdale, former State superintendent, was in its 
first volume from March, 1883, to February, 1884, beginning then a new volume as the 
Southwestern Journal of Education. The Southern Teacher was continued into 1833, 
but no numbers have been received since May of that year. Other education journals 
are the West Tennessee Normal and The Southern Normalist, published by the liter- 
ary societies of the normal college at Nashville, and occasionally educational in- 
formation has come through the columns of The Christian Advocate. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report for 1882-83, the latest complete report received, gives no full sta- 
tistics of the high schools, but shows 7 in Carroll County, 5 with annual sessions of 
10 months each and 2 with 5 months each. Other counties do not report on this 
point. Some ot the larger cities, such as Knoxville, Nashville, and Memphis, report 
statistics of their high schools, the first 2 having courses of 3 years, the last with one 
of 4, From Chattanooga, which showed a high school in 1881~’82, there is no report 
since that date. Union City, one-of the smaller cities of the Staté, having only 3,500 
inhabitants, reported a nigh school which more than prepared pupils for college, em- 
bracing in its course Greek, Latin, French, and German. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For information as to business colleges, private academic schools, schools specially 
engaged in preparing pupils for college, and Freceratery. departments of universities 
or colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of appendix; for summaries of same, the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Tennessee in 1883-84 distributed its course of instruction amon; 
8 distinct schools, each organized into classes of different grades, covering the severa. 
topics embraced in the school. These schools are: (1) Agriculture, horticulture, and 
botany; (2) natural history and geology; (3) chemistry and mineralogy; (4) applied 
mathematics; (5) pure mathematics; (6) ancient languages; (7) English and modern 
languages; and (8) history and philosophy. There is a subcollegiate course of 2 
years for those not prepared to enter the collegiate classes. The classical course of 4 
years leads to the degree of a. B. For scientific courses, see Scientific Instruction, 
further on. Of the 20 other colleges and universities reporting, 12 admitted women on 
equal terms with men. 
For their statistics, see Table IX of the appendix ; for a summary of their statistics, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 22 schools of this class on the lists of the Bureau, 17 were authorized to confer 
collegiate degrees. No material changes in their organization or courses of study are 
noted since the last report of 1881-82. The Broadhurst Institute, Clarksville, reap- 
eared in 1883~84 with preparatory and collegiate departments of a fair standard, and 
a Grange College, La Grange, after a brief suspension, reopened in September, 1883, 
Most of these schools continue to report courses of from 4 to 7 years, including music, 
drawing, perenne and modern languages, besides other studies necessary to the col- 
legiate degree, a few showing also commercial and teachers’ courses. 
‘or their statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary, the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Knoxville, offered in 
1883~’84 courses in general science and in arts, in agriculture, in civil, mechanical, 
and mining engineering, and in applied chemistry, each of 4 years; also special courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-531

in applied mathematics, in practical agriculture, and in agricultural apprenticeship, 
each of 2 years. The last course is accompanied by work on the farm during the 
afternoon of each day. 
For statistics of the above and of the scientific departments of other colleges and 
universities in the State reporting, see Table X of the appendix; for summaries of 
them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological training continued to be given in the Vanderbilt, Fisk, East Tenne 
Wesleyan, and Southwestern Universities, University of the South, and Central 
Tennessee College, in courses of 3 years each; in Cumberland and Roger Williams 
Universities, in courses of 2 years each ; while in Burritt College biblical instruction 
was given throughout the collegiate course, the biblical school being optional. 
For statistics, see Table XI of the appendix. 5 
Legal instraction continued to be offered in the Vanderbilt and Cumberland Uni- 
versities and in Central Tennessee College, with the usual requirements for admission 
and graduation. 
Medical studies were still pursued in the Nashville Medical College, a department of 
the State university ; in the medical departments of the University of Nashville and 
Vanderbilt University, Nashville ; in the Memphis Medical School, a department of 
the University of Tennessee; in the Meharry Medical Department of Central Ten- 
nessee College, Nashville (for colored students), and in the Memphis Hospital Medical 
College, a department of Southwest Baptist University. The first twonamed recom- 
mend but do not require students to take a 3-year graded course.of instruction, all 
graduate students on the old plan being required to pursue a 3-year study of medi- 
cine, including attendance on two terms of lectures. 
Dentistry was taught in the dental departments of the State and Vanderbilt Uni- 
versities; and pharmacy, in Vanderbilt University, under the usual requirements for 
admission and graduation. 
For statistles of schools of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, see Table XIII of the 
appendix; and for a summary of their statistics, the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Tennessee School for the Deaf and Dumb, Knoxville, in 1882~83 reported 101 inmates 
in the white department and 10 in the colored. All deaf-mutes in the State of proper 
age and sound physical condition are received free of expense. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind, Nashville, continues to make provision for the 
white and colored blind. ‘ ! 
In 1883-84 separate buildings were erected for the colored pupils, means having 
been provided by the legislature for this purpose. The school is graded, embracin, 
the common and some of the higher branches. Instruction is also given in vocal an 
instrumental music, including practice on a pipe organ recently presented by the 
State. Much attention is given to tuning pianos. In the industrial department mat- 
tress and broom making is taught, while the girls are trained in bead work, knitting, 
crocheting, and sewing by hand and machine. It was estimated that there are in 
the State about 212 blind youth of lawful age to enter this institution, but of these 
only 51 were enrolled. 
For statistics of these two institutions, see Tables XVIII and XIX of the appendix; 
for summaries, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
The Austin Industrial School, Knoxville, was established by Miss E, L. Austin as a 
department of the public schools for colored children, and admits those who for want 
of room attend the regular school only a half day at a time, and trains them in indus- 
trial classes the other half. During the year 1883~84, 225 were trained in the sewing 
school; 267,in the little housekeepers’ class; and 199,in the training shop, in car- 
pentry. During the holidays a substantial dinner for 25 guests was cooked and 
served by the cookery class, a charge of 10 cents each defraying the entire expense.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
SUMMER INSTITUTE. 
This organization for study and instruction held its first meeting at Mont Eagle 
Springs, Cumberland Mountain, July 2 to August 4, 1883, under the direction of Prof. 
Jas. E. Scobey, of Murfreesboro’, who gave instruction in English and supplemented 
the work in other departments. Mr. A. D. Wharton, of the Nashville High School, had 
charge of mathematics; G. R. McGee, of Trenton, charge of history ; Mr. J. I. D. 
Hinds, of botany ; Miss Acree, of Memphis, of primary studies; Messrs. Goodman and 
Baily, of writing and music. Teachers attending, 150. Educational conferences 
were held every Saturday. 
An extensive program for a meeting of this body at Mont Eagle, to be held in the 
summer of 1884, appears in the Southwestern Journal of Education for April and May, 
1884, the inauguration of a ‘‘ Southern Chautauqua” being the object. The presence 
of a large number of superintendents, leading educators, and managers of Chautauqua 
schools was promised, and arrangements were made for instruction by distinguished 
teachers in reading and elocution, writing and book-keeping, geography, arithmetic, 
grammar and language, history of the United States, geology of the Southern States, 
music, calisthenics, hygiene, and morals. Lectures on drawing and moulding, on man- 
ual training, on object ‘teaching, on school management, and on Kindergarten work 
were also to be delivered. A teachers’ institute, with a wide range of interesting and 
useful themes, was in the program; but, though it is understood that the program was 
carried out, no account of the proceedings and attendance has reached this Bureau.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The preceding summary shows an increase for the year of about 61,000 children 
enrolled in public schools, with only about 15,700 more reported as of legal school age. 
There were 654 more schools reported, expenditures being about $511,000 more, the 
average term having been extended 20 days in the country and shortened 15 days in 
cities. It must be remembered, however, that the statistics from this State continue 
to be very imperfect, owing to the failure of many county judges to report. Out of 
166 counties only 125 sent reports for the two years under review, a smaller number 
than in 1882. Under these circumstances little dependence could be placed in the 
results shown by the above comparison, were it not that their indications of progress 
are confirmed by the superintendent, who says that during these two years popular 
education was unusually prosperous. He @xpresses the belief that.the.free.schools

have passed the experimental stage and have so firmly fixed themselves in public 
esteem as to stand in no danger of discontinuance. Public school funds increased 
even in greater proportion than did the number of legal school age, notwithstanding 
the extension of the latter. There was, too, a marked improvement in the attain- 
ments and efficiency of public school teachers, who were seeking a better prepara- 
tion for their work, some at the State normal institutes, others through home study. 
The explanation given by the superintendent of the fact that so many county 
judges fail to report the school statistics is that these officers have not time for such 
duties, He advises that the State be divided into districts and that superintendents 
be appointed or elected for them, these superintendents to relieve county judges of 
the school duties now imposed on them, besides attending to additional work, includ- 
ing the examination of teachers, 
ADMINISTRATION. 
By the school.law of 1883, under which the State school system was operated and re~ 
ported for 1882~83 and 1883-84, the public schools were under a State board of educa- 
tion, composed of the governor, the secretary of state, and the State comptroller. 
The board was authorized to appoint some competent person as secretary, to receive 
a salary of $1,800 a year. 
‘ County school affairs were then and still are superintended by county judges, the 
judge of each county appointing annually a board of 3 examiners for the examina- 
tion of teachers. The school funds were distributed to the several counties in pro- 
portion to their school population, white.and colored, then 8-14 years of age; but 
the races must be taught separately, and no sectarian schools could receive any public 
school money. 
For changes since made, see New Legislation, below. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The funds for the support of public schools are derived from the interest of a per- 
manent public school fund, from legislative appropriations not to exceed one-fourth 
of the general revenue, and from a poll tax of $1 annually on all male inhabitants 
of the State 21 to 60 years of age, and in incorporated cities and towns, if the taxpayers 
so decide, an additional sum, not to exceed 50 cents on $100 of city property. Under 
certain regulations and restrictions, not distinctly stated in the law at hand, boards 
of aldermen had power in 1883 and 1884, at least, tolevy and collect ad valorem taxes 
for the support of public free schools, 
In 1882~’83 the State received from the Peabody fund $13,600 in aid of public 
schools, institutes, and Nashville scholarships; in 1883-84, $5,750. 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
At aspecially called session of the legislature, January, 1884, as appears from a re- 
port in the State Schoo! Journal, an improyement of the school law was effected: the 
office of State superintendent of public instruction is reaffirmed and the superintend- 
ent is made the official secretary of the State board of education; boards of examiners of 
teachers, who must themselves hold first grade certificates, are provided ; salaries are 
to be proportioned inthe three grades; a certificate from the State normal school or 
from one of the State summer normals exempts its holder from examination by the 
county normal boards; a diploma from a Texas State normal is substantially a life 
certificate ; and colored school communities are given the right to have trustees of 
their own race for their schools. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The councils or boards of aldermen of cities and towns are invested with exclusive 
power to maintain, regulate, control, and govern all the public free schools within 
their limits. Austin, Galveston, Houston, and others of the larger cities have school 
superintendents.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Austin in 1883~84 maintained 26 white and 8 colored schools in 8 school-houses, the 
State apportionment for the same being $7,245. The average length of school term 
for the year was a little less than 9 months. 
Dallas reported 4 white schoo]s and 2 colored, with 945 white pupils and 309 colored. 
Of the 1,760 children of school age in the city, only 7 white and 10 colored are re- 
ported as not being able to read. State apportionment, $7,920. 
Galveston had 6 white and 2 colored schools, with about 2,000 sittings, the State 
appropriating $17,960 toward their support. Of the $3,300 given the State from the 
Peabody fund Galveston city schools received about $1,400. A gift of $50,000 was 
received from Mr. George Ball for a building for high and grammar schools, the city 
board giving a site valued at $35,000. 
Houston in 188384 maintained 19 schools for whites and 11 for colored. Enrolment 
in them, 1,173 white and 764 colored pupils. Of the 3,140 children of school age, only 93 
colored youth were reported as not being able to read. Amount of school apportion- 
ment from the State, $14,130. The schools are classed as primary, grammar, high, and 
normal, with special attention given to the study of German. 
San Antonio in 1883~84 maintained 5 white schools and 1 colored, with an enrol- 
ment of 2,377 white and 430 colored pupils. The schools were taught 10 months by 
32 white and 6 colored teachers, Amount of State apportionment, $21,475. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
Persons wishing to teach in the State free schools must have from the county jud, 
certificates of qualification, both moral and intellectual, the former based upon the 
judge’s knowledge or on evidence thatsatisfieshim on that point; the latter, on the oath 
of the county board of examiners or on the certificate of the State normal school or of a 
Texas summer normal school that the applicants have passed the required examina- 
tions. The examinations for a third grade certificate cover only spelling, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, geography, and English grammar; for a second grade, in addition, 
composition and history of the United States; for a first grade, all the above, with 
elementary algebra, geometry, natural philosophy, school discipline, and methods of 
teaching. A certificate of either of these three grades is only valid for a year, but 
may be renewed by the county judge without examination if the teacher has proved 
successful. The diplomas and certificates of a Texas State normal school are sub- 
stantially for 3 years, 2 years, or during good behavior, 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Sam Houston Normal Institute, Huntsville, offers a 3-year course of strictly 
professional training, aiming to furnish competent teachers for the public schools. 
State students (4 from each senatorial district and 6 from the State at large) receive 
board free for one year, but books and tuition are free to all. The school in 1882~83 
reported 190 students and graduated 77; in 1883~84, 200 students, of whom 117 were 
graduated. The model school was suspended in 1882~83 for want of room. 
In Galveston provision is made for 2 normal classes, one for white and another for 
colored teachers, and all teachers of public schools are required to attend regularly

In Houston teachers’ normal classes are conducted every Saturday by the superin- 
este with satisfactory results. A normal class is also connected with the high 
school, 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute, Austin, presents an elementary and a 
higher normal course of instruction, each covering 2 years. To those preparing for 
the profession, both courses are recommended. The institute enrolled 177 students in 
1883~84, of whom 8 were in the normal courses.

PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report gives no information in regard to public high schools. The city 
of Houston in 1882~’83, reported 1, with an enrolment of 75 pupils and an average 
attendance of 55 and two 4-year courses of study, a classical and a general, the for- 
mer including Latin, the latter French or German. By special ordinance of the city 
council, in order to’render high school pupils eligible to free tuition, the school age 
‘was raised from 14 to 18 years.

| SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Texas was opened in September, 1883, at Austin, preliminary 
steps having been taken in 1881 by the legislature, which provided for the selection 
of its location by vote of the people, for its endowment, and for the appointment of 
regents, who were to contract for a suitable building, elect a faculty, and take other 
necessary action. In accordance with the decision of the voters, the academic and 
Jaw departments were located at Austin and the medical department at Galveston. 
The endowment of the university is to comprise the proceeds of a million acres of the 
public domain, besides other lands appropriated by the Republic of Texas in 1839 and 
by the State constitution in 1876, The law provides that the university shall be open 
to young men and women on equal terms and that tuition shall be free. Being a 
part of the public school system of the State, the university aims to establish a close 
connection with the public schools, and it is designed that as soon as practicable 
eae s from approved schools shall be admitted without examination. The aca- 
lemic department comprises instruction in literature, science, and the arts, the or- 
ganization being that of distinct schools, of which there are 6, leading to the degrees 
of B. A., B.S., B. L., B. LIT., and M. aA. The studies of the first 2 years are’ pre- 
ene tor candidates for a degree; after that, choice is allowed on advice from the 
‘aculty. | 
The ot er colleges and universities reporting are St. Mary’s University, Galveston; 
Southwestern University, Georgetown ; Baylor University, Independence ; Mansfield 
Male and Female College, Mansfield; Salado College, Salado; Austin College, Sher- 
man; Trinity University, Tehuacana; Waco University, Waco; Marvin College, 
Waxahatchie; and Add Ran College, Thorp’s Spring, which for the first time appears 
in the list of collegiate institutions. Five of the above are for young men only, 
Southwestern University, however, providing an annex for young women; the other 
5 admit both sexes on equal terms. Of these Waco University provides a somewhat 
different course for young women, supposed to be more suitable for them, which leads 
to the degree of maid of art; while Trinity University and Marvin College offer a 
shorter course, with the degree of mistress of English literature, to those who do not 
desire to take the regular one. 
All the above colleges present preparatory departments and classical courses of 4 
years, or that which amounts to the same, a number being arranged on the plan of 
independent schools. Modern languages form a part of the course in nearly all, and 
music, the fine arts, and business instruction, in many. 
For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of them, the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
| INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The somes lave institutions exclusively for young women are Dallas Female College, 
Dallas; Ursuline Academy, Galveston; the Ladies’ Annex of Southwestern Univer- 
sity, Groen (above referred to); Baylor Female College, Independence; Wood-

recent information has been received. 
For statistics of those reporting, see Table VIII of the appendix; and fora summary, 
see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, gives training 
in scientific, agricultural, and ireeiamee MET ngies in courses of 3 years, The estab- 
lishment of the new State University has been an advantage rather than otherwise 
to the college, the students now seeking instruction here being more entirely in sym- 
pathy with the industrial aims of the college than formerly. The agricultural de- 
partment has gained decidedly in favor, earnest efforts having been made to dissipate 
the prejudice of students against this pursuit. 
Courses of study in general science leading to the degree of B. 8. are found in the 
State university, Southwestern University, and Add Ran and Marvin Colleges. Aus- 
tin College gives the degree of civil engineer to students who complete a course in 
applied mathematics, 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix; and for a 
summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The theological schools reporting are the theological department of Baylor Univer- 
sity (Baptist) and the Bishop Baptist College, Marshall, the latter first opened in 
1881. Some theological instruction is also given at Trinity University, apparently 
during the collegiate course, and in Waco University special provision is made to aid 
young men who intend to become preachers in obtaining an education. 
For statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix; and for a sum- 
mary of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction is given in the law department of the University of Texas, organ- 
ized in 1883 and offering the usual course of instruction in law, extending over 2 
years. For statistics, see Table XI of the appendix; and for a summary, the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
There are no medical colleges reporting from this State. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Texas Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Austin, had. 98 pupils in 1884, anincrease 
of 4 over the preceding year, all under 9 instructors. Since its organization (1857) 
there have been 263 pupils under instruction, the average length of time spent by 
each in the institution being about 6 years. The common school branches weré taught, 
as well as articulation, agriculture, printing, and shoemaking. The State appropri- 
ated $98,736 for the institution in 1884, Valuation of grounds, buildings, &c., $75,000. 
Expenditure for the year, $94,000. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Texas Institution for the Blind, Austin, had 99 pupils in March, 1884, an increase 
of 8, under 10 instructors. The common school and some of the higher branches were 
taught, with music and the industries of broom and mattress making, chair seating, 
piano tuning, bead work, and sewing. The State appropriated about $31,000 during 
the year, which was the amount of the expenditure. Value of property belonging to 
the institution, about $95,000. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION, 
The State Teachers’ Association met at San Antonio, June 24-26, 1884, with presi- 
dent John Collier in the chair. Among the subjects of the different papers read were 
‘Methods of moral instruction in public schools,” ‘‘ Compulsory education,” “A chair 
of pedagogies in the State university,” and ‘‘The proper work of the normal schools.””

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
| GENERAL CONDITION. 
The educational condition shown in the figures of the State report for the year 
above presented indicates progress as far as it can be looked for in view of all the 
circumstances. Although in both years business was depressed, more money was ex- 
pended for public schools than in any year since 1876~77, while attendance in them 
was fairly kept up, in view of the difficulties it must encounter in a State with rag- 
ged mountain ranges, a severe winter, and a school system not yet brought to the 
point that could be desired. 
The percent. of both enrolment and average attendance in the public schools was good 
and there was a diminution in school districts, resulting from substitution of the town
-P-A-G-E-539
VERMONT. 267 
system, with its graded schools and better pay for teachers. There were 77 fewer 
teachers who had attended the State normal schools, but there was an increase in 
average daily attendance in 1883~84. The superintendent says that, while the needs 
of the ungraded schools, in which are nearly six-sevenths of the whole enrolment of 
the State, are many and great, there are signs of improvement even in these. On 
the whole, the people show more interest; there is greater demand for well qualified 
teachers ; 7 more towns have changed from the district to the town system, making 
19 in all. Nearly every town superintendent reporting advocates the town system 
and the introduction of free text books. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The school officers are, for the State, a superintendent of education, elected at each 
biennial session of the general assembly ; for towns, superintendents, elected for 1-year 
terms; for counties, examining boards, with clerks; for districts, moderators, clerks, 
collectors of taxes, treasurers, 1 or 3 auditors, and prudential committees. 
In towns where the district system has been abolished there are boards of 3 or 6 
directors; and any town having a high or central school elects for such school a 
prudential committee of 3, with annual change of 1. Women have the same right as 
men to vote in all school district meetings and in election of school commissioners in 
towns and cities, and the same right to hold school offices. A town at its annual 
meeting may abolish the district system in such town. Unless otherwise instructed, 
every child of good health and sound mind between 7 and 14 years of age is required 
by law to attend a public school at least 3 monthsin the year. A district may estab- 
a evens schools, each evening to be regarded as a half day session of a public 
school, 
' SCHOOL FINANCES, 
Public schools are sustained by district and town taxation and the income from 
town school funds and from the United States deposit fund. The interest on the last 
is apportioned to towns according to population, while one-half of the town school 
money, if it does not exceed $1,200, or, if it does, one-third of it,is equally divided 
among the districts of such towns. The remainder is divided among the districts ac- 
cording to the attendance of the children of school age during the previous year. 
Towns failing to assess school taxes forfeit to the county a sum equal to double the 
amount required to be raised by such tax, to be recovered by the county court. No 
public money of any town is to be distributed to any school district employing a 
teacher without the certificate required by law, nor to any district whose register does 
not contain the certificate of the town superintendent. No money raised on the grand 
list may be apportioned for the maintenance of strictly sectarian or religious schools. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The legislature of 1882 provided that books recommended by the text book com- 
mittees of the towns in 1879 be the authorized text books till November, 1889, and 
that all others be prohibited. As to studies, the law, as amended, provided that one 
or more schools shall be maintained in each town for instruction of the youth in good 
behavior, reading, writing, spelling, English grammar, geography, arithmetic, free- 
hand drawing, history,and Constitution of the United States and of the State of 
Vermont, and in elementary physiology and hygiene, with explanation of the effects 
of stimulants and narcotics on the human system. The time for such instruction 
was made to cover at least 20 weeks in each school year. The time allowed each 
teacher to attend a teachers’ institute, held in pursuance to law, and reckoned as so 
much time in teaching, was limited to 3 days. 
In distributing public money the selectmen were required to reckon the school year 
from March 20 to March 19. The selectmen of any town were authorized to divide, 
unite, or otherwise alter school districts in their town on the petition in writing of 
a majority of the legal voters. School directors were authorized to provide for the 
conveyance of pupils to and from the public schools at the expense of the town. At 
the session of 1884 it was enacted that each town in which the district system exists 
shall, at the annual meetings of the town in 1885 and 1886, vote upon the question 
of adopting the town system. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Burlington has a board of school commissioners of 6, 1 from each of the 5 wards 
and the city superintendent; Rutland, a board of education of 9 members, with a

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
| 
The city superintendent of Burlington says that the schools eve maintaining their 
reputation of past years, the general condition being somewhat improved. Special 
attention has been given to the health and comfort of pupils. The effort to lead them 
to act and work independently has been continued. Greater prominence has been 
given to topics which are essential or important. In school property no changes are 
reported, phough there was great need of enlarged accommodations. The efficiency 
of the system does not appear to be as great as could be wished, as in 188384 only 
49.20 per cent. of the school youth enumerated 5 years before were enrolled in the pub- 
lic schools, or 1,603, against 1,000 in private and church schools. Adding both together 
and allowing for the increase of school youth since the census of 1878, the report esti- 
mates that nearly 1,000 children of school age were out of school. 
Rutland grades its public schools as primary, secondary, and intermediate, each of 
2 years, and grammar and high, each of 3 years. Statistics of 1883~84 show a gain 
of 237 jenrolled over 1882~’83 and of 4 in teachers, but a reduction of $8,721 in expend- 
iture for schools. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
None of these useful aids to early training of children are reported from this State. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
A certificate of graduation from the lower course of a normal school or of a train- 
ing apartment of a graded school is a license to teach in the common schools of the 
State for 5 years; one from the higher course of such schools is a license for 10 years. 
A corey license for 5 years may be issued by the board of examiners chosen at the 
annual meeting of town superintendents of each county. Candidates must pass an 
examination on all the branches required by law to be taught'in the common schools, * 
and also in drawing and methods of teaching; they must, if men, be 20 years of age; 
if women, 18. A town certificate of qualification may be given to any one passing a 
satisfactory examination on the questions selected at the annual meeting of the town 
superintendents of the county. Except in the case of principals of graded and union 
schools, a teacher must hold one of the above certificates to make a valid contract for 
teaching.   STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The State sustains 3 normal schools, at Castleton, Johnson, and Randolph. The 
reports for 1882~83 and 1883~’84 show an aggregate attendance for the 2 years of 
836 and 177 graduates. In courses of study, gradation of classes, regularity of at- 
tendance, and thoroughness of professional work, all report an advance over any 
previous year, while they as uniformly call for larger appropriations to supply real 
needs for a full normal training. The State superintendent suggests that there be 
1 normal school wholly under the control of the State, and that the money now ex- 
pended on the three be united on one. , 
For full statistics of each of the above schools, see Table III of the appendix; for 
summaries of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
In counties where there is no normal school a training school department may be 
organized in a legal graded school under the direction of the State superintendent,
-P-A-G-E-541
  VERMONT. 269 
the courses of study to be similar to those of the normal schools and the certificates 
of graduation to have a similar force as those of normal schools. No reports of such 
departments have come to this Office. 
INSTITUTES AND EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS. 
As required by law, 1 institute and 79 educational meetings for the instruction 
of teachers were held under the general supervision of the State superintendent in 
the 2 years under review. The institute held at Bradford for four days was well 
attended, and is said to have been ably instructed by a large number of leading edn- 
cators, assisted by several teachers and classes from the schools. Of the other meet- 
ings no special mention is made, except that those at Newport, Irasbarg, Bethel, and 
Glover were held in connection with county associations. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
For the two years under consideration 28 public high schools are reported in the 
State, with an aggregate attendance of 1,825. Of these, 466 studied Latin, 64 Greek, 
168 French and German; 137 were graduated and 36 fitted for college. Thirteen of 
the schools had an aggregate of 3,783 volumes in libraries. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory de- 
partments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for summaries of 
same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, Burlington, continues its 
instruction in departments of art, applied science, and medicime, the first two open 
to women on equal terms with men. The department of art comprises the usual 
academic course of 4 years, leading to the degree of a. B. Candidates are admitted 
on examination, on certificate of graduation from preparatory schools whose courses 
of studies meet the requirements, on certificate of honorable dismissal from some 
other college or on, evidence of proficiency in the studies proposed to be continued by 
the candidate. All male students are required to take part in military drill and in- 
struction 2 hours each week. Through the liberality of John P. Howard, esq., the 
main college building has been reconstructed at an expense of more than $40,000. 
The library contains 21,000 volumes, 12,000 of which were from that of the late Hon. 
George P. Marsh, presented to the university by Hon. Frederick Billings, of Wood- 
stock, who has also given $100,000 for a suitable building to contain the whole col- 
lection. 
Middlebury College in 188283 and 1883-84 continued to confine its instruction to an 
extended classical course of 4 years, with high standard for admission. In all the stud- 
ies of the departments in which honors are sought, a general average of 75 per cent. 
is required for “simple honors” and of 90 per cent. for ‘‘higher honors.” During 
1883-84 $1,500 from the estate of Rev. Thomas A. Merrill were paid to the college for 
the improvement of elocution. The college library, recently increased by liberal do- 
nations from the alumni, now contains more than 15,000 volumes. 
Lewis College, Northfield, though largely scientific, offers the usual academic course 
of American colleges. 
For statistics of the above, see Table IX of the appendix; for asummary of same, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN.     
  The Vermont Methodist Seminary and Female College, Montpelier, a preparatory 
school of high standard, offers opportunities to fit for college, for business, or for the general duties of life. Its courses of study include, besides 2 preparatory, each of 3 
years, 2 collegiate courses, each of 4 years, including normal instruction for teachers, 
Jt confers on lady students who complete these collegiate courses the degrees of mis- tress of liberal arts and mistress of English literature. For statistics, see Table VIIL 
of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State Agricultural College of Vermont, in its department of applied science, offers 
instruction in courses of civil engineering, theoretical and applied chemistry, agri- 
culture and related branches, and metallurgy and mining engineering, each of 4 years. 
It continues its special winter course for young men who cannot leave their farms

in summer and fall. The topics in this course are agricultural chemistry, botany, 
physics, entomology, stock breeding, dairying, fruit culture, road making, farm ac- 
counts, and bee culture. Representatives of the college coéperate with the State 
board of agriculture in attending farmers’ meetings during the winter, giving special 
attention to fertilizers with reference to experiments conducted by the college on 
Tara kiebee nent the State. 4

| PROFESSIONAL, 
No schools of theology or law report from this State. 
The medical department of the Siate university in 1883~84 shows 18 professors and in- 
structors; 2 annual terms of 17 weeks required; a 3-year graded course recommended ; 
no requirements for admission; for graduation, the usual 21 years of age, good moral 
* character, and 3 years of study, with the passage of a final satisfactory examination. 
Matriculates, 230; graduates, 100; a gain in the former of 26 and in the latter of 32 
over 1882~83. 
/ SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES. 
cyanate continues to provide for the education of its defective classes in other 
States. Its deaf-mutes are cared for in the American Asylum, at Hartford, Conn. ; its 
lind; hin the Clarke Institution, at Northampton, Mass., and the Perkins Institution, 
Boston; and its feeble-Minded children in the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and 
Feeble-Minded Youth, South Boston. 
® REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Vermont Reform School, Vergennes, sends no report since 1881~82, at which 
time there were 146 boys and 26 girls under the usual instruction in common school 
branches and the ordinary industries of such institutions. 
} EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Of the 2 institutions of this character, Providence Orphan Asylum and the Home 
for Destitute Children, both supported by private contributions, only the latter makes 
return for 1883~’84. This shows 13 instructors and 538 inmates since foundation in 
1865. The Roman Catholic Directory showed 86 orphans in the Providence asylum in 
1883. 
For eee of schools that may have reported, see Table XXII of the appendix; 
ary of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
| VERMONT STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-fourth annual meeting of this body was held at Montpelier October 
23-26, 1883. The following topics, among others, are said to have been ably discussed: 
“What preparation do colleges expect from the high schools and academies?” “What 
constitutes a practical education ?” ‘Relation of classical to scientific studies,” ‘‘ Eng- 
lish literature as an element in education,” “How can_ ungraded schools become 
graded ?” “ How can pupils be best taught to think?” ‘‘ What should a teacher do 
before Bee first day of school ?” and ‘‘ Methods of inciting to diligence and order.” 
Mr. A L. Hardy, principal of West Randolph graded school, is reported to have 
made an interesting and suggestive exhibit of the practical work in the school room. 
een enor penmanship by primary scholars and composition by young pupils, which 
were submitted, are said to have been highly creditable, the latter being grammatical 
and grapetully expressed; samples of map and technical drawing of a high order were 
also exhibited. It was resolved that a more efficient supervision of schools is a pressing 
need of the educational system; that the establishment of village and town libraries 
in various parts of the State is noted with great satisfaction ; that the town system 
of schools be earnestly favored and hearty efforts pledged to secure its adoption 
throughout the State; and that untiring efforts be put forth in favor of temperance 
instruction in schools.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistical summary shows a very gratifying as well as stead increase in all 
that goes to make up an efficient school system. As the State school census is onl, 
taken once in 5 years, that of 1880 is used. The enrolment and attendance, as well
-P-A-G-E-544

272 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
as the number of public schools and teachers, have largely increased. More of the 
schools were graded and over 1,600 more pupils were studying the higher branches. 
The percentages of school youth enrolled and of those enrolled in average daily at- 
tendance are not yet what could be wished, but on the whole there is advance instead 
of retrogression. : 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The general supervision of the public schools is yested in a superintendent of public 
instruction, elected by the general assembly for 4 years; in a State board of educa- 
tion, consisting of the governor, superintendent, and attorney general; in county 
superintendents, appointed quadrennially by the board and confirmed by the senate; 
and in boards of district school trustees and subdistrict directors, each of 3 members, 
the former chosen by a county electoral board, the latter by the voters of the subdis- 
tricts. The schools are free to all persons of school age, the law requiring separate 
schools for colored pupils. The school census is taken every five years, and the State 
funds are apportioned on the basis of the number of school age shown by this census. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The schools are supported from the proceeds of a State literary fund, a capitation 
tax not to exceed $1 on all voters, and a property tax of not less than 1 nor more 
than ee on $1, as the general assembly may direct. County and district funds 
are derived from fines, penalties, and donations, and a tax not to exceed 10 cents on 
$100. Telegraph and railroad companies are liable to a tax for school purposes. 
Cities and towns may levy for the support of public schools a tax not to exceed 3 
mills on $1 and a capitation tax not more than 50 cents for all school purposes. 
|   AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
In 1882~83 the State received $4,125 from the Peabody fund, with the stipulation that 
$2,000 should be used for Nashville scholarships, $1,525 for teachers’ institutes, $500 
for Hampton Normal Institute, and $100 for the Educational Journal. In 1883-84, 
from this source came $1,700 for scholarships, $2,000 for institutes, $500 for Hampton 
Normal, and $2,000 for Farmville Normal School. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
All cities of 10,000 inhabitants must and all others may have a city superintendent 
of schools, uppited by the State board of education and confirmed by the senate. 
  The school afiairs of such cities are managed by a board of not more than 3 trustees 
from each ward.

Danville reported 1 high, 9 grammar, and 11 primary schools, with accommodations 
for 1,260 pupils. ‘The schools were taught 198 days. Enrolment in private schools, 
326. Valuation of public school property, $20,000. Receipts for the year were $119 in 
excess of expenditure, 
Lynchburg had 40 school rooms, with 2,000 sittings. The schools, classed as primary, 
greet and high, were taught 196 days. Estimated enrolment in private schools, 
300. . 
Norfolk in 1883~84 reported 18 schools for whites and 10 for colored, taught by 6 
imen and 22 women, with an average monthly salary of $92.98 for men and $52.15 for 
women. The schools, primary and grammar, were taught in 7 buildings, valued at 
$63,000. Private and church schools enrolled 2,447. Although no high sebool was 
reported, 140 white and 73 colored pupils were studying the higher branches. 
The superintendent said, at the close of 1882-83, that the accommodations for pupils 
were far below the needs of the city, that hundreds of children who applied for ad- 
mission had to be turned away, and that many more would probably have applied 
had they not known that it- would be useless. 
Petersburg in 1883-84 had 20 schools for whites and 21 for colored, taught 180 days, 
in 10 buildings, valued at $67,000. Of the 1,979 pupils in attendance upon the public 
schools, 94 white and 93 colored pupils were studying the higher branches. 
Portsmouth reported 10 schools for whites and 4 for colored, taught 191 days, by 4 
men and 10 women, with an average monthly salary of $82.50 for the men and $42.50

women, with an average monthly salary of $70.92 for the former and $42.86 for the 
latter. The superintendent calls attention to the efficiency of the teachers and their 
small salary, and urges that they be better paid. He further says that the public 
schools are growing in popularity, and most of the buildings are crowded largely in 
excess of their seating capacity. Private and church schools enrolled 8,153. Public 
school property was valued at $297,510. Receipts exceeded expenditure by $43. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
No one is eligible to teach a State free school unless he presents to the trustees, or to 
the patrons at a called meeting, a certificate from the county or city superintendent 
in charge of the school that he desires to teach, showing ability to teach at least 
the branches required in that school. 
Examination for such certificates must be held in spelling, reading, writing, arith- 
metic, grammar, geography, and history; and,'if the applicant desire to take charge 
of a school in which higher branches have been introduced, he must also be examined 
in such branches. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
A State normal school for white girls, authorized by the legislature of 188283, was 
organized June 10, 1834, to be opened at Farmville in October. It is designed to pre- 
pare teachers for the public sehools of the State. The law gives to each city of 5,000 
inhabitants and to each county the privilege of sending one or more students, accord- 
ing to the number of its members in the house of delegates, these State students to 
receive free tuition. The school will consist of an elementary and an advanced course, 
each of 2 years; a model school ; and the extra studies of French, German, music, paint- 
ing, and drawing. All State students must agree, on entering, to teach at least 2 years 
in the public schools of the State after graduation. The school is to have the valuable 
services of Dr. W. H. Ruffner, long the superintendent of the schools of Virginia, as 
rincipal. 
a A Stato normal school for colored pupils was authorized by the legislature of 
1881~82, and was to receive from the State $100,000 for buildings and maintenance. In 
consequence of this it was to be under the control of 7 visitors appointed by the gov- 
ernor, 6 of them well educated colored men. It has been since established under the 
title of the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, Petersburg, and presents courses, 
normal and academic, of 3 years each. Connected with it by legislative act is a sum- 
mey normal course of 8 weeks each year, to be conducted by the president and fac- 
ulty, with such trained assistants as the State superintendent may think proper, and 
all colored teachers in State schools must attend it for at least one month in every 
year. Failure to attend for 5 consecutive years is to work a forfeiture of license, and 
no new teacher may take charge of a State school till he has attended at least one 
session of this normal course, the first session of which began July, 1884, and con- 
tinued 6 weeks, enrolling 53 men and 60 women. _

OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Other normal schools reporting are the Virginia Normal School, Bridgewater; Hamp- 
ton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Hampton; St. Stephen’s Normal School, Peters- 
burg 5 dnd Richmond Normal School, for colored pupils. The first named offered a 
2-year course. Hampton, for colored and Indian youth, with 3-year normal course, in 
’83 had in this 507 pupils, 295 in day and 212 in evening classes, the senior class 
receiying daily instruction in the art of teaching. In 1883~84 the normal students 
were 349. St. Stephen’s, for colored youth, under control of the Protestant Episco- 
pal Church, also gives a 3-yearnormal course. Roanoke College in 1883 established a 
course of normal lectures in connection with the regular studies. 
Forstatistics and other information of these schools, see Table III of the appendix; 
for a summary, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
  GENERAL TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State makes no provision for teachers’ institutes, but the agent of the Peabody 
fund required that $1,500 of the amount given to the State in 1883 and $2,000 in 1884 
from that fund should be devoted to this purpose. Two normal institutes were held 
in the summer of 1883, one at Blacksburg, continning 4 weeks, and the other, for col- 
ored teachers, at Staunton, for 3 weeks. In 1884 there were four held, at Wytheville, 
Harrisonburg, Farmville, and Petersburg, with a total attendance of 1,029. The 
Wytheville institute continued 4 weeks, and the one at Petersburg, for colored teach- 
ers, was|in session 6 weeks. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
In 1883 there were 169 institutes held in 88 counties, and 221 in 1884 were held in 
80 counties, Lynchburg reporting 50 and Staunton 24. 
| EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Educational Journal of Virginia, published at Richmond, still continued to be 
the official organ of the department of education, and furnished valuable information 
as to the progress of education in the State. The general department is edited by 
William M. Fox and the official by State Superintendent R. R. Farr. 
| SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
| PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State superintendent gives no information concerning the high schoolsin 1883-84, 
but reports7,250 white and 1,024 colored pupils studying the higher branches, an in- 
crease of 445. The city of Danville reports 1 high school; Lynchburg, 3, with 132 
pupils; Portsmouth,2; Richmond reports 2 high school buildings, with 15 rooms for 
study and recitation. The one for colored pupils gives normal training, and the course 
of instruction in each school covers 3 years, a

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN. 
The Takvereity of Virginia continued in 1883-84 its academic and professional courses, 
the former in the literary and scientific departments, the latter in the departments of 
medicine, law, engineering, and agriculture. The instruction in these subjects is dis- 
tributed among 19 schools, each affording an independent course, with a professor, the 
student Gente the course he wishes to attend. Graduate courses follow the com- 
pletion of the literary and scientific courses, Attendance in all the schools, 298 in 
1883-84. Diplomas are granted to graduates of schools; degrees, to those only that 
complete a full course in a certain number of schools. 
Emory and Henry College, Emory (Methodist Episcopal South), at its last report of 
studies had 3 optional courses, the classical and Latin-scientific, each of 4 years, and 
the PERE GH of 3 years. In 1882~83 it reported 6 instructors, 98 students, and prep- 
erty valued at $100,000. 
Like the University of Virginia, Washington and Lee University and Randolph- 
Macon and Richmond Colleges continued their courses in separate elective schools. 
Hampden] Sidney and Roanoke Colleges continued their preparatory departments 
and regular classical courses of 4 years. Both offered German and French. At Roa- 
noke thes@ languages were spoken in the class rooms, and at least one of them is 
required for a degree. '

- SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. ° 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The three special scientific schools reporting for the two years are the following: 
The Agricultural and Mechanical Collegeof Virginia, which offers technical, scientific, 
and literary courses of study. Students taking only the technical have a 8-year 
course; those who seek the degree of civil or mining engineer or of A. B. have a 4-year 
course, with an additional year of special study for the degree sought. Elective 
studies are provided for those who do not intend to graduate. 
The Virginia Military Institute receives from the State $15,000 annually for the bene- 
fit of cadets unable to pay their own expenses, and affords instruction in architecture, 
engineering, mechanical Sram e, and natural sciences in a 4-year course, with a 
special school of applied science for a graduate course. 
General scientific courses of three to four years are found in Emory and Henry Col- 
lege, when last reported ; in Washington and Lee University, in its department of ap- 
plied mathematics; and in the University of Virginia, in its scientific department, to 
which is added a special course in analytical and agricultural chemistry. 
New Market Polytechnic Institute offers, besides primary, intermediate, and prepara- 
tory studies, a collegiate course of 2 years, including some of the higher mathe- 
matics. 
  PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction in the 2 years under review continued in the Union Theo- 
logical Seminary, Hampden Sidney; the Theological Seminary of the Diocese of Vir- 
ginia, Theological Seminary; and the Richmond Institute, Richmond. 
In the first two of these schools a preliminary examination or its equivalent is re- 
quired of all candidates for admission not collegiate graduates; and the three have 
each a 3-year course of study; Richmond Institute, for colored students, a 2-year 
theological course. In St. Stephen’s Normal and Theological School, for colored 
students, Petersburg (Protestant Episcopal), there were, in 1882-’83, 18 students in 
the theological department. 
The Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod South has 
made no report to this Bureau for 1882~83 or 1883~84. 
For statistics reported, see Table XI of the appendix; for a summary of statistics, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction continued to be given in the University of Virginia and the Wash- 
ington and Lee University in the usual 2-year course, no requirements for admission 
appearing in eithercase. In Richmond College the law department has disappeared. 
Medical studies aro still pursued in the medical department of the University of 
Virginia, Charlottesville, and the Medical College of Virginia, Richmond. The former, 
with an annual session of 36 weeks, has a 2-year graded course, but no requirements 
for admission; the latter, with an annual session of 24 weeks, no requirements for ad- 
mission, but for graduation 2 full courses of lectures and attention to practical anat- 
omy, attendance at clinics, and a thesis. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Virginia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, 
Staunton, in 1882-83 reported 77 mute and 42 blind pupils. In 1843~84 the pupils fell 
off to 41, cause not given. Instruction continued to be given in the common English 
branches, with articulation, drawing, and painting for the deaf, and the higher branches 
and vocal and instrumental music for the blind. The béys are taught different trades 
and the girls sewing, knitting, &c. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute aims to give the negro and Indian 
races what they most need and need now: a class of intelligent, earnest teachers, 
practical workers, and leaders. To that end it selects and trains its youth by a sys- 
tem of mental and manual labor drill. The problem is said to be to turn to account 
the labor payments of the students, who in 1882~83 earned over $35,000, being paid 
at the rate of 5 to8 cents an hour. The present proportion of racesis about 4 negroes

  to 1 Indian, there being 451 of the former and 117 of the latter. Of the 60 graduates 
_ in 1882 more than 90 per cent. engaged in teaching. Boys, in connection with school 
studies, are instructed in almost all the common industries, as well as in Hoan OEE 
while girls receive instruction in cookery, sewing, tailoring, and general housework, 
All receive pay for work, and those who fail to pass the required examination for 
admission may be to some extent employed during the day and admitted to the night 
class to fit themselves for entering the following year. 
At the Industrial School, Norfolk, established by Mrs. Hemenway in_1882~83, there 
was reported to be instruction in cookery by a graduate of the Boston Cooking School, 
in that year at least. « . 
The Miller Manual Labor School, for boys, at Crozet, is divided into 3 departments, 
primary, intermediate, and academic, the last 2 covering 3 years each. The studies of 
the school embrace the common and higher English branches, with civil engineering, 
physics, chemistry, Latin, and the modern languages. Practical familiarity in agri- 
culture, engineering, technical drawing, electrical engineering, and printing is given 
the pupil by his working at these arts. The institution owns 1,000 acres of land. 
Enrolment for the year, 164, an increase of 18. 
ORPHAN ASYLUMS. 
For statistics of orphan asylums reporting, see Table XXII of the appendix to this

| EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
CONFERENCES OF CITY AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The first annual conference of this kind was held in Richmond, February 27 to 
March Be the second, at the same place, April 15 to 19, 1884; a large majority of 
the superintendents and many distinguished educators and speakers were present on 
both occasions. The aim at each meeting was to discuss such questions and suggest 
such action as might best promote good education in the State. Those brought for- 
ward at the first conference were “School-house architecture and location of schools oT 
“Teachers’ institutes: how to organize and conduct them;” ‘‘ Methods of examining 
teachers, and advantages of such examination ;” ‘Graded schools;” ‘‘ School furni- 
ture and apparatus;” “Duties and authority of superintendents;” “Text books: 
their uses and abuses;” “State uniformity in qualifications for certificates;” ‘‘ Live 
teachers and dead ones.” 
At the second, among many other subjects treated were ‘The importance and bene- 
fits of proper school literature;” “ Higher education for women, industrial and scho- 
lastic;” “Free text books along with free education;” ‘‘Importance of grading 
schools under one teacher, and how to do it;” ‘‘Normal training for teachers.” 
In Hhaubeanee of State aid for teachers’ institutes, these conferences, attended and 
addressed by such men as Dr. Curry, of the Peabody fund; Dr. Newell, of the Mary- 
Jand State board of education, and Dr. Wickersham, long State superintendent in 
Pennsylvania, seem likely to afford important suggestions as to better organization 
and better management of all the school forces of the State,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Progress and improvement appear at almost every point, the schools growing in 
public favor and attendance in them advancing except among the colored youth. 
Discipline in them had improved very greatly, as a decrease of 3,154 is noted in cases 
of tardiness, of 971 in truancy, and of 89 in cases of suspension, while the number of 
pupils neither tardy nor absent during the year increased by 538. Almost the only 
thing that seems to be wanting to attain higher successis better pay for teacher. 
Although there are more with some experience employed and nearly 100 more from 
State normal schools, the superintendent shows that the average salary of men is on')

$180 a year and of women $155, the length of school term being very short. 
ommends that the minimum term of school, now only 4 months, be increase 
months, as the people now generally recognize the fact that 4 months out of 12 is too 
brief for effective schooling, even if the children attend continuously. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
A State superintendent of free schools, elected quadrennially by the neon de has 
general control of public school interests. Local schools are supervised by county 
school superintendents, elected by the people for 2 years, by district boards of educa- 
tion, and by subdistrict boards of trustees. District boards comprise a president and 2 
commissioners, elected for 4 years, and 1 apparently for 2 years. This board appoints 
8 trustees for each subdistrict to hold office for3 years, with annual change of 1. The 
county superintendent and 2 high grade teachers wliom he may nominate constitute a 
county board of examiners for each county to examine and license applicants for 
teachers’ certificates. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
For the support of public free schools there is levied annually a State tax of 10 cents 
on $100 of real and personal property, which, with the interest of the invested State 
school fund, the proceeds of forfeitures, fines, and an annual capitation tax, constitute 
a general school fund, annually distributed among the counties in proportion to the 
number of youth of school age in each as shown by the last enumeration. i 
Besides this State contribution there is an annual levy in each independent school 
district of not more than 50 cents on every $100 of valuation for the payment of 
teachers’ salaries within the district. i 
To provide school-houses and grounds, keep them in order, supply fuel, and pay 
other expenses incurred in connection with the schools, there is a further tax in each 
district annually of not more than 40 cents on $100. } 
      AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
For teachers’ scholarships at Nashville, institutes, and normal schools there were 
granted trom this fund $3,100 in 1883 and $2,850 in 1884. ' 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM Or WHEELING. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
The city school officers of Wheeling are a board of education of 3 members from 
ree and a superintendent of the city school district, appointed by the 
oard. | 
STATISTICS. 
For 1882~'83: Population, census of 1880, 30,737; children of school age, 9,986; pub- 
lie schools, 8; enrolment in public schools, 5,152; average daily attendance, 4,514; 
number of teachers, 106. 
For 1883~’84: Children of school age, 10,459; public schools, 9; enrolment in public 
schools, 5,013; average daily attendance, 4,386; number of teachers, 107.   ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Wheeling in 1883~84 had an enrolment of 4,849 white and 164 colored pupils, with 
an average attendance of 4,242 white and 144 colored. Schools were taught 200 days 
by 6 men and 97 women. Of the 9 school-houses in the city 3 were rented and 1 was 
built during the year. The buildings contained 104 rooms, all having fenced and im- 
proved grounds, valued, with other school property, at $246,585. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS. 
For examining and certifying teachers each county has a board of examiners, con- 
sisting of the county superintendent with 2 experienced teachers holding first class 
certificates, nominated by him and appointed at a meeting of presidents of district 
boards. Teachers must present to the proper school officers a duplicate certificate of 
qualifications to teach a school of the grade applied for. 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 1 
The State normal schools at Concord, Fairmount, Glenville, Huntington, Shepherds- 
town, and West Liberty all present courses of 3 years in normal training and nearly 
all offer preparatory. The schools at Huntington, Shepherdstown, and Fairmount 
give collegiate training. 
Storer College, Harper’s Ferry, for colored students, offers a 3-year normal course, 
and in 1884 had 87 normal students, of whom 14 were graduated. The State aids the 
school with 18 scholarships, which secure room rent and tuition for State students,

who have the free use of books also. The colored teachers of West Virginia are 
offered freo tuition from the close of their schools to the end of a summer normal term. 
Yor statistics, see Table III of appendix; for a summary of thei, a corresponding 
table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING, 
The Stato is entitled to 6 scholarships in the Nashville Normal University, awarded 
by the trustees of the Peabody fund. At the close of 1883 there were 3 vacancies ex- 
isting, all of which were filled in 1884, 1 vacancy subsequently occurring. 
West Virginia College, Flemington, has a 3-year normal course, the first 2 years be- 
ing given to the branches taught in the public schools and the third year to collegiate 
branches. A model school is connected with this department for the observation and 
practice of the pupil teachers. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The law requires that one or more teachers’ institutes shall be held annually in each 
county in the State and teachers are required to attend them. The annual cost of 
these institutes is about $1,250, of which the State appropriates $500, the remainder 
being contributed from the Peabody fund. The amount received from this source in 
1883 was $1,500; in 1884, $1,332. In addition to their attendance at the regular county institutes, the teachers in sev- 
eral counties hold for a day or two each month district institutes or teachers’ associ- 
ations, to discuss among themselves, with such patrons as will attend, local questions 
affecting the school interests of the county, methods of teaching, and schooi man- 
agement. 
      EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The West Virginia School Journal, published at Wheeling and devoted to the cause 
of education, was in 188384 in its third and fourth volumes. The general depart- 
ment is edited by the principals of the Wheeling schools, and the official department 
by the State superintendent of public schools, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
When the board of education of any district deems it expedient to establish a high 
school, it may submit the question to the voters of the district, and if they so decide 
the board is authorized to establish a high school. In 1882 there were 10 high schools 
in the State, the following year 6, and in 1884 1 more was added. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix; for summaries of them, 
corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
West Virginia University in 1882~83 entered on a new arrangement of its studies in 
10 independent schools, under 2 general courses, academic and professional. It is 
claimed that this allows greater freedom in the selection of studies and the elevation 
of the standard of instruction and attainment; that, the course being elective, the 
student may pursue the studies of any school for which he is prepared, without regard 
to his deficiency in other studies; and that, if he desires but a partial course, he may 
adapt that course to his tastes or necessities ; and, finally, that he is put upon the same 
equality with his fellows and thrown upon his own resources. Its military course of 
4 years remained unchanged. 
Bethany College, with the same arrangement by schools as the university, in 1882-83 
continued its classical, scientific, and ministerial courses, leading to the degrees of 
A. B.,S. B., and L.B. It has also an academic course of 2 years, preparatory to the 
regular college course. While all courses are open equally to both sexes, there is a 
special ladies’ course. The musical department offers a course of elementary training 
and drill in technique, both vocal and instrumental. 
West Virginia College, noted in previous years, has made no report to this Bureau for 
the years under view. 
For statistics of colleges reporting, see Table IX of the appendix; for summary of

280 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. i 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of West Virginia, in its new arrangement, offers the degree of bachelor 
of science to graduates holding diplomas in the schools of metaphysics, modern lan- 
guages, English, geology and natural history, mathematics, agriculture, chemistry, 
and physics. 
Bethany College, in its school of mathematics and astronomy, has a scientific course 
of 4 years, including, with subjects in the classical course, applied mathematics, road 
and railroad engineering, descriptive geometry, shades and shadows, and perspective 
drawing. A special course in engineering includes, in addition to some of the above, 
surveying, drawing, levelling, profiling, and mapping. No time is specified for this 
course. 3 
For other information in regard to these schools, see Table X of the appendix, 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.—The only theological instruction given in the State in 1882~83 appears 
in the ministerial course of 4 years in Bethany College. The studies of the first 
2 years are classical, those of the third and fourth years theological, of a fair stand- 
ard. 
Legal training in 1882-83 continued in the State university in its school of law and 
equity, embracing the usual studies. The degree of bachelor of laws will hereafter 
be conferred on graduates of this school. 
For statistics of these schools, see Tables XI and XII of the appendix. 
Medical.—Up to 1882~’83 no full medical school or department apyears in the 
State. In the school of anatomy, physiology, and hygiene of the West Virginia Uni- 
versity there was preparatory medical training in anatomy, with dissection ; in physi- 
ology and hygiene, by specimen, the microscope, drawing, and lectures. A foundation 
has been laid for a medical museum. Under the new order of things this department, 
it is said, has had during the session of 1882~&3 more bona fide medical students than 
ever before. The faculty hope soon to complete a medical department. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The West Virginia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Romney, 
founded in 1870, reported for 1883 an appropriation from the State of $23,450 and 
buildings and other property valued at $80,000. There were 102 pupils under instruc- 
tion, of whom 66 were deaf-mutes and 36 blind. All are taught the common English 
branches, with drawing for the deaf and music for the blind; also, the usual indus- 
trial occupations of such schools, 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
WEST VIRGINIA EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The State Association met at New Martinsville, July 1-3, 1884, Hon. B. L. Butcher 
presiding. ae, the subjects presented and discussed were “The old and the new 
in education,” “The relation of the State university to the free school system,” ‘‘ Re- 
form schools,” ‘‘ Building for the children of the South,” and ‘‘Grading county 
schools.” The meeting was regarded asa very profitable one, and the association will 
hold its next session at Keyser.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show a steady increase in the school population, which in 1883-84 
pumbered $3,517 more than in 1881-82, As may be seen, the advance in the number of 
pupils under instruction did not keep pace with the increase in school youth in 1883~84
-P-A-G-E-554
282 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  Above 7,000 more were enrolled in public schools, but.5,575 fewer are reported from 
private schools, which brings the net increase down to 2,200, counting students in nor- 
mal and collegiate institutions. Fuller statistics from private schools, however, the 
State superintendent says, would change this presentation very much, several of the 
largest cities in the State, where it is well known there are large numbers of private 
schools, sending no reports of them. Besides, as he 8, the failure of attendance to 
keep pace with population is easily understood when it is remembered that a large pro- 
portion of the increase in population has been in the newer portions of the State, 
where time is required to provide school facilities, and in a few large cities, where 
school accommodations are almost always inadequate. The number of pupils 7 to 15 
years of age reported in public schools in 1883~84 was 14,691 more than in 1831~82 and 
3,466 more than in 1882~83. Fuller statistics on this point, itis believed, would show 
that nearly all of that age attended during some portion of the year. More school 
districts were reported, a fairly larger number of schools with more than one depart- 
ment appears, more houses were built, and there was an in e of expenditure for 
all school purposes. Sixteen towns adopted the township system in 188283, four 
more did so the next year, and more school districts were supplied with libraries, dic- 
tionaries, maps, and globes. A larger number of the country districts have adopted 
a graded course of study, and this effort tosystematize the work of the common schools 
has resulted in the more rapid advancement and the more equal and symmetrical 
development of pupils where the experiment has been tried in good faith and with 
earnest purpose. The superintendent advises that district boards be required by 
law to adopt a course of study prescribed by the superintendent, just as they are 
required to adopt a list of text books, and that all teachers be required to organize 
their schools in accordance with it. 
ADMINISTRATION,   
  
    
A State superintendent, elected biennially by the people, has general supervision 
of the public schools. Each county has a superintendent, and counties with 15,000 or 
more inhabitants may have 2 of these officers. Districts have boards of 3 directors. 
Towns which have adopted the township system have township boards, consisting of 
the clerks of the several subdistricts belonging to the township. Women are eligible 
to all school offices except that of State superintendent. Public schools must be non- 
sectarian; they are free to all resident youth 4-20 years of age, a census of whom is taken 
annually by the district clerk. Children 7-15 years of age must attend school at least 
12 weeks in each school year unless their education has been otherwise provided for 
or unless excused for specified causes. The public school system comprises high and 
normal schools and a State university. There are also State institutions for the blind 
*and deaf and a State Reform School. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
Public schools are supported from the income of a State school fund and from local 
taxation. The income of the State school fund is distributed annually to such towns 
and districts as send the required reports and show: that they have raised towards 
the support of common schools one-half the amount last appropriated to them from 
the State fund and that they have maintained schools at least 5 months in the year, 
a3 months’ term in extraordinary cases being accepted. School money is apportioned 
according to the school census.

PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES. 
  Teachers to be legally employed in publie schools must have a certificate of qualifiea- 
tion from their county superintendent.or from a State board of examiners, unless they 
are graduates of one of the State normal schools, or the State university or other college 
 
-P-A-G-E-556
284 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in the State with equivalent courses of study; and no person may receive a certifi- 
cate who does not write and speak English correctly andeasily. Certificates granted 
by county superintendents are of 3 grades, the first good for 2 years, the second for 
1 year, the third for such term as is specified on the certificate, but not for more than 1 
year. Each county superintendent establishes for his county, under the advice of the 
State superintendent, the standard of attainment which must be reached by appli- 
eants for the different grades of certificates. The board of examiners, which is ap- 
pointed by the State superintendent, gives State diplomas, good for 5 years and for 
life. The State superintendent also has power to grant diplomas to graduates of the 
‘university and of colleges, which are good until annulled; and diplomas of graduates 
from the full 4-year course of the normal schools, countersigned by the State super- 
intendent, become unlimited State certificates after the holder has taught successfully 
one year, 
STATE NORMAL TRAINING. 
The 4 State normal schools, located, respectively, at Oshkosh, Platteville, River 
Falls, and White Water, had in 1882-’83 a total enrolment of 1,903, of whom 952 were 
in normal departments; and in 1883~84 the whole number increased to 1,971, that of 
normal students being 940. All have elementary and advanced normal courses, both 
together covering 4 years. All have primary, intermediate, grammar, and prepara- 
tory departments, and that at Oshkosh a Kindergarten training class. The aggregate 
number completing the courses in 148384 was 71 from the elementary and 30 from 
the advanced course, an increase in the former of 16 and in the latter of 4 over the 
preceding year. 
A handsome and commodious building has been erected in Milwaukee for a State 
normal school, which will be opened as soon as the funds at the disposal of the board 
of regents will justify such action. 
Among the teachers in the public schools of the State there were in 188384 243 
who were graduates from normal schools, an increase of 57 over the preceding year. 
By a law of 1883 the free high schools of the State are required to include in their 
course instruction in the theory and art of teaching and in the organization, man- 
agement, and course of study of ungraded schools; and all examinations of teachers 
for the high schools are to include examinations on these subjects. 
The question of the reéstablishment of a chair of pedagogy at the University of 
Wisconsin was decided in 1883~’84, and President J. W. Stearns, of the State Normal 
School at White Water, was tendered, in June, 1884, the appointment to the chair, 
and accepted it, to take effect in February, 1885. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The City Normal School of Milwaukee continued to prepare teachers for the city 
schools, and in 18¢2~83 had 24 students, under 2 teachers. 
The National German-American Teachers’ Seminary, Milwaukee, for 1883~84 reports 
25 normal and420 other students, under 9 instructors. The course of study covers 3 
years. Six pupils were graduated during the year and engaged in teaching. 
The Catholic Normal School of the Holy Family, St. Francis Station, has a 3-year 
normal course, with preparatory studies, and in 1883~84 reported 50 normal students 
and 56 others. 
Galesville University, when last beard from, offered a 3-year course of normal train- 
ing, all the studies being pursued which are required by the State for a first class cer- 
tificate. 
Melton College, in its preparatory department, reported teachers’ courses, the element- 
ary and advanced together covering 4 years. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County teachers’ institutes were held under State authority in 1882~’83 in all the 
62 settled counties, one county having 3. In all 4,429 teachers were in attendance. 
In 1883~84 there were 63 institutes held again in the 62 counties, with 4,757 teachers 
attending. The institutes were in session generally from 4 to 10 days, and each had 
an average daily attendance in 1883~84 of 60, an excellent record. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
The Wisconsin Journal of Education, published at Madison and conducted by the 
State superintendent and his assistant, continued in 1884 to be the organ of the State 
Teachers’ Association and of the department of public education, and in that year 
was in its fourteenth volume. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Stute appropriates $25,000 annually for the maintenance of these schools, which 
may be established under the law where not less than 25 pupils are prepared to enter 
upon a high school course. The schools are in charge of a high school board, consisting — 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
  WISCONSIN. 285 
of a director, a treasurer, and a clerk in joint high school districts; but in cities not 
under county superintendents the city board acts as a high school board. The course 
of study to be pursued and the standard for admission are established under the advice 
of the State superintendent. 
Asmay be seen under the head of State Normal Training, these schools are now 
utilized as means of preparing teachers for the lower schools. 
The number of high schools organized under the free high school law in 1888 was 114; 
the number making special reports and receiving State aid was 110. Pupils enrolled 
for that year, 7,519; instructed in English branches only, 6,400; in other branches, 
1,119; while 454 completed the course of study. 
In 1884 there was 1 more organized; 2 more received State aid; the enrolled pupils 
(7,689) were 170 more; a smaller number than in the previous year studied English 
branches and a larger number the higher branches; and 475 completed the course, 
making a total of 3,430 graduates since the organization of these schools. The major 
part of the teachers in both years held either State certificates of qualification or 
normal school, collegiate, or university diplomas. ’ 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Wisconsin, Madison, admitting both sexes and giving free tuition, 
comprises in its collegiate department a college of arts and one of letters, the latter 
including an ancient and a modern classical course, leading to the degrees of a. B. 
and Lit. B. In the college of arts a general course in science, leading to the bachelor’s 
degree, is provided, besides several technical courses, including agriculture. Of the 
professional schools contemplated, only that of law has as yet been established. 
The board of regents report in 188384 that for a number of years past the history 
of the university has been that of rapid, continuous, and wholesome growth, a growth 
not alone measured by increase in the number of students, but also by necessary ad- 
ditions to real estate and buildings, by the progressive enlargement of cabinets and 
libraries, by the establishment of new and the expansion of old departments of in- 
struction, and especially by the higher grade of instruction imparted. 
Seven other institutions in the State are classed by this Office as colleges or uni- 
versities, viz, Lawrence University, Appleton; Beloit College, Beloit ; Galesville Uni- 
versity, Galesville; Milton College, Milton; Racine College, Racine; Ripon College, 
Ripon; and Northwestern University, Watertown. All but 2 of these are open to both 
sexes, all have preparatory and classical courses of study and all but 2 scientific 
courses, all include one of the modern languages in their course of study, while in most 
of them two or three of these languages are studied. Instruction in business and in 
music and the fine arts is given by 3. 
For full statistics of colleges and universities reporting to this Office, see Table IX 
of the appendix; and for a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Three colleges exclusively for young women are Wisconsin Female College, Fox Lake; 
Milwaukee College, Milwaukee; and Santa Clara Academy, Sinsinawa Mound. The 
college at Fox Lake is authorized by law to confer collegiate degrees. All include 
music, drawing, painting, and German in the course of study, one adding French and* 
another Italian. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix; and for a summary, 
see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Instruction in scientific branches is chiefly given in the college of arts of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsion, which includes, besides a general science course, departments 
of agriculture and of civil, mining, metallurgical, and mechanical engineering, all 
having courses of 4 years, which lead to a corresponding bachelor’s degree. 
Courses in science, leading to the degree of bachelor of science, are also offered by 
Lawrence and Galesville Universities and Milton, Racine, and Ripon Colleges. 
For statistics of scientific schools reporting, see Table X of the appendix; and for a 
summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The theological schools reporting are the Mission House, Franklin (Reformed); the 
Lutheran Theological Seminary of the Synod of Wisconsin; Nashotah House, Nash- 
otah (Protestant Episcopal); and the Seminary of St. Francis of Sales, St. Francis 
(Roman Catholic). All but the last named report a 3-year course of study and require 
an examination for admission. In the Seminary of St. Francis the course is 9 years;

how many of these are preparatory does not appear. For statistics of these schools, 
see Table XI of the appendix; and for a summary of them, see the report of the Com- 
missioner preceding. [ 
Legal training is given in the college of law of the University of Wisconsin, in a 
course of 2 years, the method of instruction being chiefly by reading, lectures, and 
moot courts. Applicants for admission who are not college graduates must be 20 years 
old and must pass an examination in the ordinary English branches. For statistics, 
see Table XII of the appendix ; and for a summary, the report of the Commissioner 
preceding, | 
Medical instruction was offered in only one school, and that is extinct. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Delavan, founded in 1852, 
trains the deaf-mutes of the State for a useful life, giving instruction in the common 
and higher English branches, including anatomy, philosophy, chemistry, and natural 
history. Special attention is given to articulation, penmanship, morals, and manners. 
Sewing, knitting, ironing, printing, cabinet and shoe making are taught. Pupils in 
188384, 212, under 13 instructors; State appropriation, $40,000. The institution 
owns 37 acres of land, which, with buildings, &c., was valued at $100,000. Expendi- 
tures for the year, $40,000. 
The Milwaukee Day School for Deaf Children, founded in 1883 and under control of 
the Wisconsin Phonological Institute, reports 8 pupils, but does not define the stud- 
ies. The oral method is employed. The city appropriated $1,200 for maintenance of 
the school during the year and $300 were received from tuition fees. 
St. John’s Catholic Deaf-Mute Institute, St. Francis, founded in 1876, in 1883-84 had 
22 boys and 15 girls under instruction, Common school studies were pursued; artic- 
ulation, to a limited extent, and agriculture, shoemaking, needlework, and general 
housework were taught. 
For further statistics of deaf-mute schools, see Table XVIII of the appendix ; and 
for a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the Blind, Janesville, in 188384 had 
78 pupils, who received instruction in common and high school branches, in vocal 
and instrumental music, and in carpet weaving, cane seating, sewing, and fancy work. 
The age for admission is from 8 to 21 years, and the State provides free board and tui- 
tion. All youth are admitted whose vision is too defective to allow them to receive 
the benefit of public school instruction. Total receipts for the year, $25,000; expend- 
itures, $18,000; value of all property, $175,000; volumes in library, 1,76 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Boys, Waukesha, under State control, receives 
boys between the ages of 10 and 16 years, and in 188182 reported 132 released on 
tickets; 21 released at 18 years of age, the limit of detention; 7 discharged; 8 escaped; 
eand 299 on the roll. In 1882~83 there were 229 pupils reported. The institution was 
founded in 1860, since which time 1,979 boys have received its care. The common 
school branches are taught; also, farm work, shoemaking, and knitting. 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls, Milwaukee, established in 1875, has for its 
object the moral and intellectual training of girls under 16 and boysunder 10 yearsof 
age who are found destitute or disobedient or are in manifest danger of becoming 
vicious. In 1882~’84 there were 149 enrolled, some in a Kindergarten class, all rep- 
resenting 40 different counties. School is in session for the little ones 2 hours in the 
morning, 3in the afternoon; 1 hour in the evening for the others. Thestudies include 
the common school branches, with some scientific and general literature. Instruction 
is also given in sewing, laundrying, and general housework. 
For statistics of reform schools reporting, see Table XXI of the appendix; and for a 
summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
WISCONSIN STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The winter session of this association was held in Madison, December 26-28, 1883. 
President J. W. Stearns, of the White Water Normal School, called the meeting to order, 
and Professor Payne, of the University of Michigan, delivered an address on ‘‘ Educa- 
tion as a university study.” Among other subjects presented were ‘“ Industrial educa- 
tion in Europe and America,” “ Institution life for deaf and dumb,” “The Netherlands    
-P-A-G-E-559
  \ WISCONSIN, 287 
and the Rhine,” and “Normal work in the highschool.” “Among ‘the'topics reported 
upon were ‘‘ How can the schools secure better supervision?” ‘‘ What modifications 
ot the school course do the times demand?” and ‘The teacher’s mission in awakening 
in the community an interest in school work.” 
The summer session was also held at Madison, July 14-15, 1884, President Stearns 
again in the chair. After the committees were announced, papers and reports were 
read and discussed upon ‘‘ The school and the home,” ‘‘ Elementary education,” ‘‘ Edu- 
cational systems in the South,” and ‘Instruction in the high schools in the theory 
and art of teaching.” After the election of officers for the ensuing year the meeting 
adjourned. 
CONVENTION OF CITY AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The annual convention of these school officers was held in the afternoon of Decem- 
ber 28, 1883, with State Superintendent Graham in the chair. The attendance ot 
superintendents was meagre, only 18 being present. Some very interesting subjects 
were presented, but owing to lack of time the discussions were brief.

  288 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ALASKA. 
Educational affairs in Alaska remain much as reported in 1882~83, the principal 
schools still being those in the southeastern portion of the Territory conducted and 
supported by the Presbyterian Church. A letter from their superintendent, Rev. 
Sheldon Jackson, reports them to be steadily growing in influence and in attendance. 
Of 7 different settlements mentioned, in which one or more schools had been taught 
during some portion of the year 1883~84, the number of pupils attending in 5 was re- 
ported, aggregating from 500 to 600. One of them was a summer school, which fol- 
lowed the natives 16 miles down the coast, returning with them in the fall. Three 
schools had industrial departments connected with them; that at Sitka, having been 
designated asthe Government industrial school for Eastern Alaska, promises great en- 
largement of its work. 
No late information is at hand from any except 1 of the 3 schools sustained by the 
Alaska Commercial Company in the southwestern section of the Territory. This, at 
St. Paul’s Island, reports 47 pupils enrolled during 1882~83. 
The appropriation by Congress of $15,000 for industrial schools and $25,000 for com- 
mon schools in Alaska will doubtless give a powerful impetus to education in the Ter- 
ritory.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As will be seen from the preceding summary, the public schools, while not up to the 
standard desired, were making a fair degree of progress. The census taken in June, 
1883, showed a school population of 9,376, more than 48 per cent. of whom were en- 
rolled in public schools in 1883-84, with about 35 per cent. in average daily attend- 
ance, an increase for the year of 8 per cent. enrolled and of nearly that proportion in 
average attendance. In the year 17 more school districts were organized, 19 more 
school-houses built, more schools were taught, and the average term for the Territory 
was, according to a written return, 60 days longer, though a printed report gives an in- 
crease of only 30 days. ‘The new school-houses were said to be substantial and well 
adapted to the purposes for which they were erected, several of them having also 
been built with an eye to beauty of design and finish, and supplied with the latest 
improved furniture and apparatus. A majority of the country schools had also been 
supplied with the necessary school apparatus. The standard of scholarship required 
for license to teach was being gradually raised throughout the Territory. Many of 
the teachers had been teained in a normal school, and at least one-half of those who 
applied for certificates during 1883 and 1884 were graduates of universities or normal 
schools. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The school system of Arizona 1s conducted by a superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, elected for 2 years by the people; a territorial board of education, consisting 
of the governor, tervitorial treasurer, and saperintendent; county superintendents ; 
195 
 
-P-A-G-E-562
  290 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
j 
county boards of 3 examiners; and a board of 3 school trustees for each district. The 
county probate judge is ex officio county superintendent and presiding officer of the 
county board of examiners. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
Four forms of school taxation are provided by the law. The first two, which are 
obligatory, consist of a territorial tax of 15 cents on $100, which forms the territorial 
school fund, and of a county tax of not less than 50 nor more than 80 cents on $100, 
which is known as the county school fund. The third is conditional, only being re- 
quired of those districts in which the tax apportioned is inadequate to secure three 
months of school, and the fourth an optional tax for prolonging the schoo] term 
beyond the three-month limit or for building school-honses, voted on by the district 
at a meeting called by the board of trustees. The territorial fund is apportioned to 
the counties on the basis of school population, 10 per cent. of it for libraries, the an- 
nual amount, however, not to exceed $20 a year for this purpose. 
Moneys arising from escheats go into the territorial schoo! fund; those from fines, 
forfeitures, and gambling licenses, into the county school funds, except in incorpo- 
rated villages or cities. 
SCHOOL SYSTEM OF TUCSON. 
SCHOOL STATISTICS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Tucson had for January, 1883, an enrolment of 318, an increase of 84 over the pre- 
gecing ent all under 6 regular and 2 special teachers, these last of music and Span- 
ish. © school registers show that most of the new pupils come from families that 
have resided in the city for two years or more but have never before sent their chil- 
dren to the public schools. The superintendent states, with regret, that the school 
buildings do not meet the requirements of this growth, and that a further increase 
in attendance is impossible. A new building was to be erected soon, however, which 
will furnish ample room. Schools are classed as primary, grammar, and high, the 
course of study covering 11 years. Music and drawing enter into the first 8 years, 
gece! attention being given to oral instruction. Expenditures for the year were 
8,455. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. 
Teachers must have attained the age of 18 years, must hold certificates of quali- 
fication from the county board of examiners or from the superintendent of public in- 
struction, must eeeb 9 school register, and make proper certified reports to the county 
superintendent at the end of each quarter. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The law provides that whenever a county contains 20 districts a teachers’ institute 
may be held at least once a year. Teachers are required to attend and participate in 
its proceedings. But the superintendent says the districts are scattered and the ex- 
penses attending institutes great. None, consequently, have been held in the last 
two years. 
SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
SECONDARY. 
The Territory makes no provision for the instruction of its youth beyond the com- 
mon school course. Tucson, however, reports a high school, which offers 2 courses, 
scientific and literary, each of 3 years. The former includes the study of Spanish, and 
Latin is added to the latter. Students may elect either course, and diplomas of 
graduation are given on a satisfactory completion of it.

(From report and return of Hon. W. H. H. Beadle, territorial superintendent of 
public instruction of Dakota, for the two years indicated. ) 
TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As may be seen from the foregoing table, education has shared in the general pros- 
perity that has marked Dakota affairs in the years reviewed. The superintendent 
says a better public sentiment has developed, and even a spirit of enthusiasm in school 
work, while the people have demanded longer terms and better schools and have kept 
their children more continuously and regularly in school. The large increase in school 
population and enrolment made it necessary to erect 785 school panne, thus largely 
increasing expenditures. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Educational affairs are in the hands of a superintendent of public instruction, ap- 
pointed biennially by the governor and confirmed by the legislature ; of county super- 
intendents, chosen biennially by the people, women being eligible; and of township 
boards of 3 members, elected for 3 years, with annual change of 1. The duty of 
these boards is to provide buildings, employ teachers, regulate schools, and disburse 
the funds of the township. The school census must be taken annually. _ The Bible
-P-A-G-E-564
    292 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
may not be excluded from any public school nor deemed a sectarian book, and the 
law requires that the highest standard of morals shall be taught. School attendance 
is compulsory on all children 10 to 14 years of age for at least 12 weeks in each school ~ 
year, 6 of these weeks to be consecutive, unless such children are excused by the school 
authorities for good reasons. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
Taxation is of two kinds: (1) a county tax of $1 on each elector and of 2 mills 
on $1 of taxable property, to be distributed to the several school corporations of the 
county in proportion to their youth over 7 and under 20 years of age; (2) alocal tax, 
not to exceed 3 per cent. of the taxable property of the district in which it is levied. 
The general tax, or public fund, as it is called, is increased by penalties of various 
kinds and is distributed according to the ratio of school youth in each school corpo- 
ration. 
NEW SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
A new school law in 1883 changed the ending of the school year from March 1 to 
June 30; made the school age, which had undergone several previous alterations, 7-20; 
required an annual census of school children; abolished districts and subdistricts 
in school townships; gave free choice as to the schools to be attended, but made 
education for at least 12 weeks in each school year compulsory on all youth 10 to 14 
years of age; and appropriated $600 a year for the employment of experienced con- 
ductors of teachers’ institutes. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF YANKTON. 
ADMINISTRATION AND STATISTICS. 
The municipal system is in no way subordinate to tho territorial system, its only 
obligation being to report its school population in order to receive its share of the 
school fund. Under a board of education composed of 10 members, including secre- 
tary and treasurer, the Yankton system in 1883~84 was still progressing. Theschool 
population of the city comprised 1,114 children, of which number 751 were enrolled in 
public schools and 474 were in average daily attendance. The schools, classed as 
primary, grammar, and high, were taught 175 days by 13 teachers, including the su- 
perintendent, who gives part of his time to teaching, and 1 special teacher of vocal 
music. The schools occupied 12 rooms, containing 576 sittings for study. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS, 
Teachers to be employed must present certificates of qualification from the super- 
intendent of public instruction or from a county superintendent, and to receive pay 
must furnish duplicate reports of attendance and whatever statistics are needful for 
making an accurate report of their schools at the end of each term, one report for the 
district clerk and one for the county superintendent. 
TERRITORIAL NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Territorial Normal School, Springfield, has been suspended. 
Notice comes through the New York School Journal that a new State normal school 
was opened at Madison, December 5, 1883, under the principalship of Prof. C. 8. Rich- 
ardson, a graduate of Colby University, Waterville, Me. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The University of Dakota presents teachers’ courses of 1 and 2 years and 2 years of 
advanced normal training. Students qualified to teach at the end of the first and sec- 
ond years receive a certificate of proficiency, and those who satisfactorily complete 
the 4-year course receive diplomas conferring the degree of bachelor of didactics. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The law requires institutes to be held, conducted by teachers employed or designated 
by the territorial superintendent, and $600 are appropriated annually for this purpose. 
Every applicant for a county teacher’s certificate must pay $1, which is added to the 
institute fund of the county where it is received. From the territorial fund not more 
than $60 may be paid for the expense of any institute, which institute must continue 
in session two weeks, and no institute aided by this fund shall continuo for less than 
five days. Two or more counties, however, may be grouped into one institute and 
$80 appropriated for its use. Money assigned for any particular institute may be 
added to the county institute fund of any county and the institute extended as long 
as the combined funds may last, not exceeding four weeks. In 1883~’84 there were 39 
county institutes held and 70 sessions of county teachers’ associations were reported.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
This class of schools is not required by law, but has been established in the larger 
towns. Yankton, the only one furnishing statistics for 1882~83, had 1 school building, 
with 46 sittings for study. The enrolment during the first quarter was 37, with 33 in 
average daily attendance, but the number fell off considerably before the end of the 
year, only one being graduated, many of them leaving the high school to enter the 
new college. Owing to the advantages of an advanced education from this source, 
the course was shortened from 4 years to 3. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
TERRITORIAL UNIVERSITY. 
The University of Dakota, Vermillion, organized and opened in 1883, has prepara- 
tory and collegiate departments, the former extending over 3 and the latter over 4 
years. The collegiate department has 3 courses, classical, scientific, and literary. 
A 4-year course in normal training is also presented, as before stated, and arrange- 
ments are being perfected for thorough instruction in vocal and instrumental music. 
In 1883-’84 there were 95 students enrolled, under 7 instructors. 
. . By a vote of the regents, Superintendent W. H. H. Beadle was to organize and con- 
duct at the university a normal institute in August, 1884, of which full information is 
expected in the report for 1884~85. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION, 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Dakota School for Deaf-Mutes, Sioux Falls, founded in 1880, in 1883-’84 had 23 
pupils, under 2 instructors, making 28 from the beginning. The common English 
branches were taught, with penmanship, drawing, and agriculture. The Territory 
appropriated $12,000 and the expenditures were $4,830 for the year.

DISTRICT SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
In the absence of printed reports of the public schools in the District, their general 
condition can be seen only from the preceding statistics, gathered at the office of the 
superintendent and certified to by him. 
From 1880-81 to 1882~83 there was an increase of 1,272 in enrolment, although tbat 
of the colored youth fell off by 873; in average daily attendance, a gain of 1,561, that 
of colored falling off by 477. In 1882-83 there were 3,295 more sittings than in 1880~81; 
45 more teachers, of whom 12 were colored ; expenditure for public schools increased 
$142,379, while school property seems to have diminished in value $120,533. The 
gains of 1883~84 over 1882~’83 show a continued advance on all material points, there 
being no decrease worthy of note except of 1,000 in the private and church schools 
and of $109,994 in expenditure for public schools, 
From both white and colored superintendents assurances were received that the 
schools of both classes were in a prosperous condition, 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The absence of suffrage in the District of Columbia places the choice of the 9 mem- 
bers of the board of trustees, which is the educational authority, in the hands of the
-P-A-G-E-567
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 295 
Commissioners of the District. This board annually selects 2 superintendents, who 
are its chief executive officers, and chooses supervising principals, who act under the 
supervision of these superintendents; through its committee on teachers, the board, 
of trustees also appoints an examining board composed of the 2 superintendents and 
an undefined number of supervising principals and principals of public schools. To 
assign each superintendent to his proper sphere of action, the public schools have 
been formed into 8 divisions, the first 4 comprising the white schools of Washing- 
ton, the fifth those of Georgetown, and the sixth the rural schools for both races, 
over all of which one of the superintendents exercises authority; the seventh and 
eighth, comprising the colored schools of Washington and Georgetown, are under the 
control of his colleague. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
To support the system Congress makes an annual appropriation, one-half of which 
is taken from the amount raised by local taxation and the other from the public 
funds of the United States. The school age is 6-17. The schools are all graded, with 
afew exceptions among the rural schools, and each race is taught by instructors of 
its own color. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS. 
All examinations of candidates for teachers in the public schools and for promotion 
are conducted by a board of examiners consisting of the 2 superintendents and others 
appointed annually by the committee on teachers from the supervising principals 
and the principals of public schools. The result of such examinations is reported to 
the committee on teachers, who select such candidates as in their judgment have 
given evidence of qualification and report their selection and the class of certificate 
to which the candidates are thought to be entitled to the board of trustees, who pro- 
ceed to consider the same and determine what candidates may receive certificates 
and the grade of the certificates. 
DISTRICT NORMAL TRAINING. 
There are 2 normal schools connected with the public.school system of the District, 
1 for white teachers, the other for colored. Owing to the non-publication of school 
reports there is no official information in regard to them at hand. The Miner Train- 
ing School for Colored Women Teachers is said to have done goo dservice in training 
teachers for the colored schools of Washington, It is under the care of Miss Lucy 
Moten, a graduate of these colored schools and more recently of the State Normal 
School at lem, Mass. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Washington High School reported for 1882~83 382 students, including 51 unclassi- 
\fied ; and for 1883~84, 509, including 41 unclassified students, showing an increase of 
127 over 1882~’83. The courses, each of 3 years, are (1) academic; (2) scientific; (3) 
business. There is also a special elective course for the first and second years in 
object drawing, historical ornament, plant forms from nature, projection, and per- 
spective ; for the third year, a choice in instrumental drawing, free hand drawing, 
and designin colors. The graduating class of 1883 numbered 13 young men and 23 
young women. In its new quarters, the school has ample accommodations in study 
and class rooms, and the advantages of a library, lecture and drawing rooms, drill and 
exhibition halls, and laboratories. Military training, under a United States officer, 
was among the regular exercises of the school. 
The High School for Colored Students is said to have been in successful operation dur- 
ing the year, but no report of it has been published. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For information respecting business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory 
schools, or preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the 
appendix; for summaries of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Georgetown, Columbian, and Howard Universities continued in 188384 substan- 
tially the same collegiate courses they have heretofore reported. They are allof fair 
standard and well equipped and officered. Columbian University has been provided 
with a large and excellent brick building in the heart of Washington, near its medical 
 
-P-A-G-E-568
  296 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. | 
i department, the law school having a home in the new university building. Howard, 
through aid from friends, made a eetnalig of an industrial department m carpentry, 
tin and sheet iron work, printing, shoemaking, sewing, and cookery, to be enlarged 
as means may be provided. 
Gonzaga College in 1883-84 had as yet only the beginning of a true collegiate course, 
necpded by rudimentary and grammar classes, with a non-classical course of undefined 
length. 
In the National Deaf-Mute College the curriculum embraces 5 years, 1 of them in- 
troductory. Students desiring to do so may pursue a selected course of 3 years for 
the degrees of B. S., PH. B., or L. B. The master’s degree is conferred on graduates of 
3 years’ standing who furnish evidence of progress in science, philosophy, literature, 
or the liberal arts after graduation. 
For further information concerning these colleges, see Table IX of the appendix; 
for summaries of same, the report of the Commissioner, preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Scientific courses of 3 years, leading to the degree of B. 8., continue in the George- 
town and National Deaf-Mute Colleges. In the Columbian University a Corcoran 
School of Science and Arts has been established, and will open in October, 1884, in 
the new university building, corner of Fifteenth and H streets. The general course 
will embrace studies in literature, science, and arts, leading to degrees of bachelorof 
science, of civil, mechanical, and mining engineer. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.— Howard University in 1883-’84 had a well organized theological de- 
partment (non-sectarian), with Greek and Hebrew for such as are prepared for them, 
the course requiring 3 years. -Its support comes from the American Missionary Asso- 
ciation and the Presbytery of Washington City. . 
Legal.— The law departments of Georgetown, Columbian, Howard, and National Uni- 
versities in 1883~84 continued their 3-year courses of legal instruction, leading to the 
degree of bachelor of laws; also, additional graduate courses of 1 year, on completion 
of which the degree of master of laws is Rantateds Graduates are admitted to prac- 
tice at the bar of the District after examination by a committee appointed by the 
court. 
Medical.— The National Medical College, medical department of Columbian Univer- 
sity, and the medical department of Howard University have each an annual session 
of 20 weeks, the medical department of the National University (1884) one of about 
27 weeks, while the medical department of Georgetown College shows one of 30 weeks. 
All have 3-year graded courses; all require for admission evidence of qualification for 
the successful study of medicine ; and, for graduation, substantially 3 years of study, 
attendance on 3 courses of lectures, clinics, anatomy, and dissection, with final satis- 
factory examinations on all the studies of the course. « 
Pharmacy.— The National College of Pharmacy, with annual session of about 32 weeks, 
requires for graduation 2 years of study in chemistry (practical and analytical), toxi- 
cology, pharmacy, materia medica, and botany, the degree of doctor of pharmacy be- 
ing conferred. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Kendall Green, near Washington, 
including the Deaf-Mute College, in 1883 had 106 pupils, 40 admitted during the year. 
Of these 41 were in the college department and 65 in the preparatory. The work of 
instruction has proceeded as usual. In the intellectual courses the success is said to 
have been highly satisfactory. Training in articulation has been given to nearly two- 
thirdsof the primary department, with very gratifying results. The older pupils have 
derived great physical benefit from the gymnasium. Such boys as were capable of 
improving have been taught carpentry and cabinet work. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
As heretofore, the District of Columbia continues to provide for its blind in the 
Maryland Institution for the Blind. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY. 
The Associated Charities of the District of Columbia, in July, 1884, at its central office, 
opened a school for the instruction of girls 12 to 18 years of age in housekeeping. 
They were taught to build fires, set and wait on tables, wash dishes, sweep and dust,
-P-A-G-E-569
DISTRICT-OF COLUMBIA. 297 
take care of house, wash and iron, make beds, and sew. Two exhibitions of progress 
made are said to haye given proofs of excellent training and satisfactory results. 
The same association opened a free Kindergarten, with an average attendance of 20 
children 3 to6 yearsof age. There was also maintained jointly a kitchen garden and 
a Kindergarten for a portion of the year. 
An industrial school has been supported, the principal going into the streets and 
picking up the children who were roving about in idleness and filth, and putting them 
under wholesome influences. This association has paid, in a 6-month term, for the 
instruction of one class in cookery. 
The Metropolitan Industrial School reports in 1883-84 the introduction, among other 
industries, of the manufacture of straw goods, with encouraging success. There were 
56 girls enrolled in the school. A night school for boys who work during the day is 
said to have been well attended. 
The Reform School of the District of Columbia reported for 183384 a total popula- 
tion of 243; committed during the year, 103; discharged, 80; leaving at close of the 
year 163 inmates. All the younger boys are employed one-half their time in chair 
caning. The tailoring and shoe departments furnish clothes and shoes for all the in- 
mates. Various, other industries receive attention. The schools hold regular ses- 
sions throughout the year in rooms provided for the purpose. 
The Industrial Home School of the District of Columbia, for both sexes, had, at be- 
ginning of 1883~’84, 63 inmates; received during the year, 58; discharged, 44; cared 
for, 121; found homes for, 22; returned to friends, 18. The schools are under public 
school control and are said to have made fine progress. Industries are pursued in a car- 
penter’s shop, a greenhouse, and garden. Girls are instructed in house work and 
sewing, with the prospect of soon having a kitchen garden. 
CHILDREN’S HOMES AND ORPHAN ASYLUMS. 
Six such homes and asylums reported in 1881~’82 an aggregate of 583 inmates and 
continued their work in 1883~84. 
For information as to these institutions, see Table XXII of the appendix; for a sum- 
mary of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
TRAINING IN ART AND MUSIC. 
So far as known, the enterprising art schools of Mr. W. M. Rouzee, Mr. Edmund C. 
Messer, Mrs. S. E. Fuller, and Mrs. I. R. Morrelle, reported in 1881~82, continue their 
work, though no official report from any of them has been received at this Office for 
188384. The same is true of the Washington Conservatory of Music, Mr. O. B. 
Bullard; the School of Music of Mr. Theo. Ingalls King; and the Georgetown Con- 
servatory of Music.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Itis a source of regret that the statistics from counties and districts are so incom- 
plete, but the summary above given indicates healthy growth. The superintendent 
says that the success of the ernie. schools in Boisé City and Lewiston has been most 
gratifying, a higher standard having been attained than ever before; that every year 
the demand becomes more imperative for a higher degree of education; and adds 
that there is a great and increasing improvement in the school-houses built throughout 
the Territory. The principles of light, ventilation, and hygiene are receiving in some 
degree the attention which their importance demands; the standard of teachers is 
improving, and there is a growing tendency to allow them a more suitable compensa- 
tion, The salaries in the rural districts average about $50 a month and board; in 
gies, communities, from $60 to $125; and in the more advanced schools, from $75 
to $150. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The territorial controller is ex officio superintendent of public instruction and county 
auditors are ex officio county school superintendents. Each county has a board of 
examiners and each district a board of 3 trustees. Schools cannot be sustained from 
the public school fund if any political or sectarian doctrines be taught therein; and 
the distribution of books, tracts, or documents of this character in them is forbidden 
by law.
-P-A-G-E-571
IDAHO, 299 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are sustained from the income of a general territorial school 
fund, from a county tax of not less than 2 nor more than § mills on the dollar, from 
moneys arising from legal fines and forfeitures, and from fees paid by teachers for 
certificates of qualification. The basis of distribution of the school money is the num- 
ber of children of school age (5-21 years). Districts may levy special taxes for building 
or repairing school-houses, and, when the cost of repairs does not exceed $25, the 
trustees may levy a rate bill, to be collected from such patrons of the school as are 
able to pay. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS, 
Teachers must present to the proper school officers certificates of qualifications from 
the county board of examiners, said certificates to state the branches which the holder 
is competent to teach and to be valid for 2 years; and no certificate may be granted 
to any applicant who is not found competent to teach the common English branches. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
The law of Idaho makes no provision for this means of instruction for its teachers, 
put Superintendent Onderdonk says institutes have been held in several counties, 
with beneficial effects, and that their establishment has given rise to a spirit of emu- 
lation among the teachers. He further says that, if the legislature would adopt a 
territorial system and provision could be made for holding a territorial teachers’ in- 
stitute, such institute would be of incalculable value to the educational interests of the 
Territory. 
ADVANCED INSTRUCTION. 
NORMAL AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, COLLEGES, ETC. 
There are no schools for normal, secondary, superior, or special instruction reported 
from this Territory.

INDIAN TERRITORY. 3801 
TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The above table denotes an important and general advance in every way. Of the 
264,369 Indians in the United States, exclusive of those in Alaska, 64,000 wear citizens’ 
dress and 71,194 speak English sufficiently well for ordinary conversation ; 38,051 fami- 
lies were engaged in agricultural pursuits during the year and the number of male 
Indians performing manual labor in civilized pursuits was 57,053. _ There were 29,074 
houses occupied by Indians, of which number 1,975 were built during the year by the 
Indians and 292 for them. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The school systems of the Five Nations are nearly alike. The Cherokees have a 
board of education, consisting of 3 persons of liberal literary attainments appointed 
by the principal chief and confirmed by the senate, who appoint to each primary 
school 8 directors for local supervision. Among the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, 
and Seminoles there are superintendents of public schools, boards of education for 
general control and for local supervision, and trustees who have charge of the schools 
in the districts into which the territory of each tribe is divided. 
Each nation holds teachers’ institutes at its capital annually. Schools are estab- 
lished only where 10 or more scholars can be got together. The neighborhood builds 
the house and the nation furnishes teachers and books. Most of the teachers are edu- 
cated Indians,who teach only English in their schools. In addition to the neighbor- 
hood schools, each nation has academies and seminaries, and boarding schools for their 
children alone. The Cherokees have 2 fine seminaries, managed and operated by 
themselves. The Choctaws have 3 large academies, managed by religious associa- 
tions. The Chickasaws have 4 academies, conducted by contractors who are citizens 
of their nation. The Seminoles have 2 and the Creeks 4, under the management of 
religious societies. There are also private schools receiving no support from the 
nations. 
The schools at Carlisle, Hampton, and Forest Grove, Oreg., were continued in 1882~83 
and 1883~84 on essentially the same plan as previously, namely, with a combination of * 
industrial pursuits and school studies, half a day for each. It is also learned that in 
January, 1881, a boarding and industrial school was opened at Albuquerque, N. Mex., 
for the children of the Pueblo Indians of that region, which had for its first year an 
average attendance of 40. Thisschoolin 1883 reported 112 attending for a month or 
more during the year, with an average attendance of 82; in 1884 the enrolment was 147, 
the average attendance 115. Otherschools of this class arereported at Genoa, Nebr., 
and at Chilocco, Ind. Ter. Movements were on foot for at least one other in New 
Mexico, in some connection with the projected university of that Territory, and for 
yet another at Lawrence, Kans.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The above summary, as well as other information, indicates a steady improvement 
in the schools in nearly all essential respects, the only exception being a small decrease 
in average daily attendance. But these statistics are not so complete and accurate 
as could be desired, owing partly to the law, which requires two reports each year, thus 
bringing together figures which properly belong to two separate years, and partly to 
the neglect of district officers to furnish their reports when due. There was a fair 
inerease in the number of youth of school age and a greater one in the number en- 
rolled in public schools, the enrolment being nearly 54 per cent. of the enumerated 
youth, notwithstanding the fact that the school age here comprises all between 4and 
21 and that very few attend school who are under 5 or over 15. The superintendent 
thinks that very few children between these ages are out of school. An increase was 
reported in the number of schools, in the average term taught, in the amount of funds 
expended on the schools, in the number of school-houses, and the valuation of school 
property. The superintendent notes a great improvement in school buildings and fur- 
niture in many partsof the Territory, nearly every city or town of considerable size 
having an elegant and commodious graded school building,

ADMINISTRATION. 
Educational affairs are managed by a territorial superintendent of public instrue- 
tion, county superintendents, and district boards of 3 trustees. The first is appointed 
biennially by the governor; the others are elected by the people, county officers for 2 
years and district boards for 3, with annual change of 1. Provision is made for the 
education of colored children in separate schools. Instruction must be given in all 
schools, during the entire course, in morals, manners, and laws of health, with due at- 
tention to physical exercise and to the ventilation and temperature of school rooms, 
Nothing of a political or sectarian nature may enter into the instruction in any school. 
SCHOOL FINANCES, 
The schools are sustained from money derived from a county tax of not less than 3 
nor more than 5 mills on the dollar, from unlimited taxes voted by the districts, from 
various fines, and from a fund arising from the sale of town lots previously reserved 
to provide for the erection and furnishing of school buildings, or for general school 
purposes when the district shall so elect. ‘The county tax and the amount derived 
from legal penalties are distributed to the districts in proportion to their population 
of youth of school age, excluding Indians not under the guardianship of white per- 
sons, provided school has been maintained 3 months. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS. 
Teachers must hold certificates of qualification from the recognized school officers, 
such certificates to be valid for 2 years, and, to receive their last month’s pay, must 
submit an annual report to the county superintendent and a duplicate one to the dis- 
trict clerk. 
TERRITORIAL NORMAL TRAINING. 
The law makes no provision for normal instruction. In 1882 a normal course was 
given in the Helena High School, but no further information has been received. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The law requires that teachers’ institutes be held annually in every county having 
5 or more organized districts and makes it the duty of the territorial superintendent 
to attend. Such institutes were held in 1883 in every county but 2, and in 1884 in 
every county but 1. Attendance was generally good, and 3 days were profitably 
spent in discussing various methods of teaching, the evenings being generally devoted 
to lectures or discussions of more general questions. The superintendent says the 
results of these institutes have fully realized the anticipated benbiites The law re- 
quires teachers to attend these institutes, but names no penalties for non-attendance. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
High school studies are a part of the territorial system. The Helena High School 
in 1882 reported scientific and classical courses of 4 years each, but no information has 
been received subsequently of this or any other. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of an institution of this class, see Table VI of the appendix; and for 
a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
During 1883~’84 there were 4 deaf-mutes maintained by Montana at the National 
Deaf-Mute College, Washington, D. C., and 1 at the Missouri Institution for the Edu- 
cation of the Deaf and Dumb, Fulton, Mo.

NEW MEXICO. 
TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
By an act of the legislature approved March 31, 1884, a system of public schools 
was established in the Territory of New Mexico. Under this a superintendent of schools 
foreach county is to be appointed by the county commissioners, holding his office till 
his successor is appointed. Each superintendent must within one month after he is 
qualified, or as soon thereafter as practicable, call a public meeting in each school dis- 
trict, when 3 directors are to be elected, to hold office till the next general election, 
when the same number are to be elected for 2-year terms. Each of the voting precincts 
constitutes a school district, in which must be established at least one public school. 
In these schools the common branches are to be taught, with history of the United 
States, in English or Spanish, or hoth, as the directors may determine. The county 
school funds are to be apportioned to the various districts in proportion to the num- 
ber of children 5 to 20 years of age residing therein. 
No reports under this system can be expected until the close of the school year 
8485.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics of 1883 and 1884 show wth in nearly all particulars, the only ex- 
ception being in the per cent. of school population enrolled in public schools, the 
+ number of school age having increased during the year by nearly 3,000 and that of 
pupils enrolled by only 638. The average attendance, however, was 1,286 more than 
the previous year, the per cent. of this to school population remaining about the same; 
the average term for the Territory was 5 days longer, and the average pay of teachers 
increased, as did the whole amount expended for public scheols and the valuation of 
school property. 
The superintendent says there has been a natural and vigorous growth in the schools 
and a great improvement in the character and value of the instruction given; that 
there is an increasing demand for good and well trained teachers, as well as for good 
and well furnished school-houses, with a determination on the part of school officers 
and people to do all that is possible towards securing these. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The territorial superintendent of district schools, elected for 2 years, has general 
charge of public school affairs. The local officers are county superintendents, elected 
by: the people for 2 years, and district school trustees, elected for 3 years, with an- 
nual change of 1. There are also boards for the examination of teachers, comprising 
3 members, appointed by the county courts. The territorial and county superintend-

ents, in convention, determine what text books are to be used in the public schools. 
The law requires district trustees to take an annnal census of school youth and to 
report to the county superintendent the condition of the schools. 
1 SCHOOL FINANCES. 
Public schools are supported from a tax of 3 mills on $1 of ordinary taxable prop- 
erty, from taxation of railroads, sale of estrays, and a special district tax not to ex- 
ceed 2 percent. ayear. Theschool funds are distributed in proportion to the number 
of children of school age (6-18), as reported annually by county superintendents. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS. 
Teachers must hold certificates of the required qualifications, signed by the board 
of examiners ; these certificates are valid for the term of 1 year. 
TERRITORIAL NORMAL TRAINING. 
The University of Deseret gives free tuition annually to 40 normal students, in addi- 
tion to the.40 annually provided for by the Territory, There was in 1883-84 a much 
larger attendance in the normal department than ever before. In 1883 the course 
was extended from 1 year to 2 years, and the president of the university expresses 
himself as being thoroughly convinced of the wisdom of the change, and recommends 
that a model school be established in connection with the normal department, having 
the 3 grades of primary, grammar, and high school studies. Five students were 
graduated from the 2-year course in 1883 and 20 in 1884. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Brigham Young Academy, Provo City, offers a 2-year course of normal instruc- : 
tion, but does not report fall statistics. Utah County provides for a permanent class 
of 10 students in this institution. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The County Teachers’ Association holds 10 sessions annually at Provo, Utah County, 
and among the minutes of these meetings is found the discussion of the following sub- 
jects: (1) That the grading of schools is economy of means, time, and labor ; (2) that the 
employment of non-progressive and transient teachers is not a remunerative invest- 
ment; (3) the encouragement and support of proficient teachers is a public benefit; 
and (4) that the school should be made a pleasant place of resort instead of a purgatory 
for boyhood. Other institutes were held during the year in Box Elder, Cache, Sevier, 
and Wasatch Counties. 
      SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
There is no information regarding any public tee schools in this Territory other 
than the academic department of the University of Deseret.

tory and normal 2years each. The studies include chemistry, free hand, mechanical, 
and architectural drawing, physiology, geometry, surveying, botany, music, French, 
German, Latin, &c. 
A series of lectures is given upon the elements of law, intended to be preliminary 
to a fuller course of study in the future.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
he GENERAL CONDITION. 
The territorial superintendent in 1882-83 reported a prosperous condition of the 
schools throughout the Territory, the educational interests keeping pace with the 
rapid advancement of the Territory in other respects; that the number of school dis- 
tricts and school-houses had increased in proportion to the great increase of popu- 
lation; and that the school buildings were of a better class than formerly and largely 
supplied with improved furniture. The figures for 1863-84 show a large increase in 
the number of pupils enrolled in public schools and a still larger one in the average 
daily attendance, more school-houses, a larger number built during the year, more 
teachers employed, and an increase in expenditure corresponding to the advance in 
other respects. The superintendent says that within the past few years there has 
_been a strong and steadily increasing demand for a better class of teachers and as a / 
consequence great improvement had been made in this direction. 
ADMINISTRATION.   The chief. school officers are a territorial superintendent of public instruction, ap- 
pointed for 2 years by the governor and contirmed by the legislature, and a territorial 
hoard of education, composed of the superintendent and 1 person from each judicial 
district appointed by the governor for 2 years. County officers are superintendents, 
elected by the people for 2 years, and boards of examination for teachers, comprising 
the county superintendent and 2 teachers chosen by him, who must be holders of the 
highest grade of certificate. District school affairs are in the hands of a board of 3 
directors, elected for 3-years, 1 being changed each year, and a district clerk, Women 
are eligible to school offices and may yote at school meetings, 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
  308 =-s- REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Public schools must be taught by qualified teachers at least 3 months during the 
year; the schools must teach the common English branches in the English language 
and be open free to all residents 5 to 21 years old. Attention must be given to tl 
cultivation of manners and morals, to the laws of health, physical exercise of the pu- 
pils, and to the ventilation and temperature of the school room. Nothing of an infi- 
del, partisan, or sectarian nature may enter into the instruction in any public school 
or be admitted in any school library. To receive their apportionment of the school 
funds, districts must take an annual census of the school children and report to the 
county superintendent. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The schools are supported from an annual tax on property of not less than 2 nor 
more than 6 mills on $1 and the proceeds of certain special taxes, fines, and penalties, 
all to be apportioned according to the number of youth of school age. Districts may 
raise funds, by taxation not to exceed 10 mills on $1, to furnish additional school 
facilities. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
A new school law of 1883 modifies the compulsory law previously reported, makin, 
the age of children required to attend school 8 to 18, instead of the former 6 to 16, an 
the time for absolute attendance in ordinary circumstances 3 months each year, instead 
of 6 months. Time lost by any child because a school has not been taught the re- 
quired 3 months, or from other cause, must be made up the next year or as soon as 
the disabling cause is removed. The penalty for disobedience or neglect of these 
requirements is $100, to go to the school funds of the district. The school age was 
also changed from 4-21 to 6-21. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS. 
Teachers must hold certificate of qualification from the legal school officers, first 
grade to be valid for 3 years, second grade for 2, and third grade for 1 year. Those 
holding first grade county certificates and who have been teaching for 3 years are 
eligible to examination for first grade territorial certificates. 
TERRITORIAL NORMAL TRAINING. 
The normal department of ihe University of Washington Territory gives a 3-year 
course of normal instruction, including chemistry, geology, physiology, botany, com- 
mercial law, and other higher English branches. primary training school is con- 
nected with this department, giving illustrative lessons in the art of teaching. 
Whitman College also offers a 3-year course of normal training, and students who 
complete the first 2 years or elementary course receive certificates, while those com- 
pleting the advanced or full course receive normal diplomas. The higher English 
branches are taught, with music, mental philosophy, and the science and methods of 
teaching. 
For statistics of these departments, see Table III of the appendix ; for a summary, 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION.

GENERAL CONDITION. 
Information as to the public school work of the Territory is so meagre and unsatis- 
factory that but few items can be given even for 1882~83, but, as may be seen above, 
they denote improvement. 
. ADMINISTRATION. 
The territorial librarian is ex officio superintendent of public instruction for the . 
Territory. County superintendents are elected biennially by the people, and for each 
school district boards of 3 trustees are elected for 3 years, with annual change of 1. 
Women are eligible to vote and to hold school offices. Separate schools may be es- 
tablished for colored children when there are 15 or more of these ina district. A com- 
pulsory school law requires parents or guardians to send their children of school age 
(7-21) to some school at least 3 months in each year or furnish satisfactory reason for 
not doing so, under penalty of $25. County superintendents and district directors may, 
in their discretion, establish schools of higher grade than the ordinary districtschools, ~ 
the studies pursued in them to be determined by the territorial teachers’ institute. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The public schools are sustained from a poll tax of $2 on each voter, from 2 mills on 
$1 of all taxable property, and from fines, penalties, and forfeitures. The people may, 
at the annual district meeting, vote such tax as they deem necessary to pay teachers, 
to purchase libraries, build or repair school-houses, and to procure fuel, or books for 
poor children, the amount for a library not to exceed $100 for any one year. 
PREPARATION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
GENERAL TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS. | 
Teachers must have certificates of the required qualifications from the legal school 
officers, and in the question of salary no discrimination is made on account of sex 
when the qualifications are equal. | 
  TERRITORIAL NORMAL TRAINING. 
The law requires the superintendent of public instruction, with the county superin- 
tendents and principals of all graded schools in the Territory, to hold annuaily, at 
some convenient place, a territorial teachers’ institute, for the instruction and ad- 
vancement of teachers, to continue not less than 4 nor more than 10 days; but noin- . 
formation is at hand of any such meeting.

EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS. 
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-second annual meeting of the National Educational Association was 
held at Saratoga, N. Y., July 9-11, 1883, including, as usual, meetings of the general as- 
sociation and of the different departments, of which a new one was organized on this 
occasion —- the department of art education— making 6 departments, the others being 
those of higher instruction, superintendence, industrial education, normal schools, 
and elemcutary schools. ‘The following were the addresses given before the general 
association: ‘Examination of teachers,” by Eli T. Tappan; ‘The moral influence 
of manual training,” by Dr. J. R. Buchanan; ‘The teaching of drawing in gram- 
mar schools,” by Walter 8. Perry; ‘‘ City systems of management of public schools,” 
by J.T. Pickard ; ‘‘ The normal school problem and the problem of the schools,” by H. 
H. Straight; and ‘‘ What has been done for education by the Government of the United 
States,” by Hon. John Eaton. 
The twenty-third annual meeting, held at Madison, Wis., July 15-19, 1884, brought 
together, it is said, the largest and most eminent gathering of educators that ever 
assembled on this continent. It is estimated that over 6,000 persons were present 
during the four days. The speakers announced were present as a rule, and the pro- 
gram was successfully carried out. All sections and States were well represented, as 
were all grades and methods of teaching; the discussions, oral and written, evinced 
ability, research, and enthusiasm; the educational exhibits showed improvement in 
apparatus and text books, while the various reunions held and the general cordiality 
were noticeable features of the gathering. 
On account of the large number present, the general sessions were divided into three 
sections, one meeting in the assembly chamber, another in the senate chamber, and the 
third in achureb. Addresses of welcome were made by the governor of the State, 
Hon. Jeremiah M. Rusk; by Mayor B. J. Stevens, of Madison; and by Dr. John 
Bascom, president of the University of Wisconsin. Among the topics presented to 
the general association were ‘Citizenship and education,” by Hon J. L. M. Curry, of 
Richmond, Va.; ‘“‘The Utah problem as related to national education,” by Prof. J. 
M. Coyner, pu. D., Salt Lake, Utah ; ‘Science of education,” by Hon. T. W. Bicknell, 
LL. D., Boston ; ‘‘ Educational status and needs of the South,” by Maj. R. Bingham, 
superintendent of Bingham School, North Carolina; and ‘The educational outlook 
in the South,” by Prof. B. T. Washington, Tuskegee, Ala. An address was made 
by Albert Salisbury, superintendent of education of the American Missionary Associa- 
tion, showing what the North has done in and for the South since the war, mainly 
through the inissionary societies of the churches. One by Hon. G. J. Orr, of Georgia, 
contained an eloquent appeal for national aid for southern education, and Prof. Will- 
iam H. Crogman, of Atlanta, Ga., gave an able résumé of the present status of negro 
education in the South, its helps and hindrances. Following this topic came that of the 
education of theIndians. General 8. C. Armstrong, of the school at Hampton, Va., gave 
the results of his six years’ experience in the teaching of Indians there, and Alfred L. 
Riggs, of ihe Santee Agency, Nebraska, gave a paper entitled ‘“ Special difficulties in 
educating Indians.” A collection amounting to $175 was then taken to defray the ex- 
peuses incurred iu having a party of Indians present from the Santee Mission, Nebraska. 
The third evening was set apart as ‘‘ Woman’s evening,” a new feature in the associa- 
tion meetings, and one which in this case proved a cay acceptable one, the places 
of meeting being crowded with eager listeners, Miss Sarah E. move of Rhode Island, 
presided. The first address was by Miss May Wright Sewall, of Indiana, on‘‘ Woman’s 
work in education,” and Mrs. Louisa P. Hopkins, of New Bedford, Mass., presented 
thesame topic. Miss Frances E. Willard, of Chicago, spoke on ‘‘Temperancee in schools ;” 
Mrs. Bya D, Kellogg, of Massachusetts, on “ Needs in American education ;” and Miss 
Clara Conway, of Memphis, Tenn., on ‘‘The needs of southern women.” During this 
evening Governor Rusk tendered a reception to all members of the association at his 
private residence, Elaborate preparations had been made for this reception and about 
5,000 people were entertained. 
On the closing day the association listened to remarks from Monsignor Capel, the 
distinguished Anglo-Roman divine, who urged the importance of paying greater atten- 
tion to the study of the English language in our schools, and spoke again in the even- 
ing, giving the ‘‘Catholic view of public education” and reiterating the desire of the 
church for religious instruction. Addresses were also presented by G. Stanley Hall, 
LL. D., professor of pedagogy at Johns Hopkins University, on “ Elementary educa- 
tion;” by Hon. J. W. Dickinson, secretary of the Massachusetts State board of educa- 
tion, on ‘‘ Method in teaching”; and by J. M. Greenwood, superintendent of schools,

t Kansas City, Mo., on “ Primary instruction.” President W. T. Harris and others dis- 
cussed the ‘ Relation of the art of education to the science of education,” and closing 
remarks were made by Rey. A. D. Mayo, of Boston, General John Katon, Lu. D., and 
others. General Eaton expressed great satisfaction at the success of the convention 
and thought that it would be the means of a great awakening in educational interests, 
especially in the South. 
Among the resolutions adopted was one favoring national aid to education in the 
South; another advised the introduction in public schools of instruction as to the ef- 
fects of aleoholic liquors on the hnman system. 
Sessions were held during the four days by each of the 6 departments of the associa- 
tion, and many of the papers and discussions were of special interest ; but lack of space 
forbids even an enumeration of the many topics presented. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, 
The National Council held its fourth annual meeting July 10-13, 1884, at Madison, 
Wis. About 25 members were present at the opening session, President E. E.White, 
of Ohio, in the chair. After the opening address of President White attention was 
given to the report of the committee on hygiene in education, the special topic being 
‘Recess or no recess.” The report, which was read by Dr. J. H. Hoose, of the State 
Normal School, Cortland, New York, favored the continuance of the recess, as also 
did, apparently, a majority of the speakers who discussed it. Among other subjects 
considered by the council were ‘‘ Oral instruction,” by Hon. J. W. Dickinson, of Mass- 
achusetts; ‘‘ The duties of city superintendents,” by Aaron Gove, of Denver, Colo,; 
“Mode of election, tenure of office, and grades of superintendents,” by A. J. Rieko: 
Yonkers, N. Y.; and ‘Preparation for college,” by Rev. Lemuel Moss, D. D., of Indiana, 
All these topics were quite fully discussed and some of them recommitted to commit- 
tees for future report. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, 
The thirty-third annua) meeting of this association, held at Philadelphia, Septem- 
ber 4~7, 1884, it is said, was one of the largest and most successful meetings ever held, 
Among the addresses and papers of the first day were the following: Before the de- 
partment of economic science and statistics, one on ‘Scientific methods and scien- 
tific knowledge in common affairs,” by General John Eaton, United States Commis- 
sioner of Education ; before the physicssection, one on the nature of electricity, by Prof. 
John Trowbridge; before the section of geology and geography, one on the erystal- 
line rocks of the Northwest, by N. H. Winchell, of Miunesota; and before the anthro- 
pological section, one on the antiquity of man, by Edward 8. Morse, of Salem, Mass. 
At the second day’s session Professor Minot called attention to the proposed organiza- 
tion of an International Scientific Congress. He said that the British Association, atits 
recent session in Montreal, received the proposition most cordially, and appointed as 
2 committee to consider it three of the most eminent members of the assoviation. In 
the economic science section a large collection of charts and diagrams was explained 
by Prof. E. B. Elliott in elucidation of ‘The principles of graphic illustration.” The 
professor also gave a lecture on ‘‘ The credit of the United States Government,” after 
which Miss Alice C. Fletcher, of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Mass., gave per- 
sonal experiences among the Omahas, her text being “Lands in severalty to the In- 
dians,” and John Biddulph Martin, of London, England, read a paper on ‘The future 
of the United States.” Before the same section, on the following day, a paper was read 
on ‘‘ Technical education in the British Islands,” by Henry Hennessy, F. R. 8., of Eng- 
land; also, one on the commercial relations of the United States with Spain and her 
colonies, by His Excellency Don Arturo de Marcoartu. Mr. Charles W. Smalley, of 
Washington, D. C., then submitted some statements respecting the salmon industry, 
In the chemistry section, on the second day, an interesting discussion occurred on the 
“Analysis of a mural efflorescence,” in which Professor Silliman, of Yale, took a prom- 
iment part. In the section on geology and geography the most interesting subject 
considered was the relative level of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, with 
remarks on the Gulf Stream and deep sea temperatures, by Prof. J. E. Hilgard. 
In the mechanical science section Professor Alden read a paper on “Training for 
mechanical engineers.” 2 
In the section on physics, during the third day, Prof. Graham Bell made a staté- 
ment of a possible method of electrical communication between vessels at sea, which 
would be also available between light-houses within distances of one mile. Mr. W. 
Preece, electrician to the British Government, followed in a description of experiments 
made by himself between the Isle of Wight and the mainland, proving thatit was pos- 
sible to maintain communication by means analogous to those described by Professor 
Bell. Prof. ©. A. Young, the retiring president of the association, read a scholarly 
paper on ‘‘The pending problems of astronomy.” After the election of officers for 
the ensuing year the association adjourned to meet at Bar Harbor, Mount Desert, 
Maine, provided satisfactory arrangements could be made at that place, otherwise the 
meeting will be held at Ann Arbor, Mich.

  312 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION. 
The American Institute of Instruction held its fifty-fourth annual meeting at Fa- 
byan’s, White Mountains, July 11-13, 1883, which was largely attended and is said to 
have been a very interesting session. 
Its fifty-fifth annual session convened at Cottage City, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachu- 
setts, July 7-10, 1884, at the opening of which about 2,000 persons were present, the 
presigent Homer B. Sprague, in the chair. He sketched the history of the institute 
rom 1830, At that time popular education was ina deplorably low condition. There 
had been no efforts to make teaching a profession; schools were kept, but in no true 
sense were taught; parental indifference and neglect were every where prevalent. 
In such a state of things this association originated, and has codperated in all the 
Stare put forth in behalf of education, helping in the solution of every educational 
problem. 
At the close of this interesting address, W. T. Harris, LL. D., of Concord, Mass., in- 
* troduced the first topic, ‘Moral instruction in public schools,” followed by Hon. 
J. W. Dickinson, secretary of the Massachusetts board of education, in a discussion on 
“High schools.” A paper on “Special preparation for citizenship” was then read by 
George H. Martin, of Bridgewater, Mass., and ably discussed by General H. B. Car- 
rington, LL. D., of Boston. Prof. A.B. Palmer, M.D.,LL.D., of Michigan University, 
spoke of the importance of a knowledge of sanitary science, or the science and art 
of good living, as a branch of popular education. 
“The New England Primer,” ‘Language in schools,” “One way of studying poetry in schools,” ‘(English in schools,” ‘‘The educational reading of teachers,” 
with other topics, were presented and discussed with interest. Hon. Daniel H. Cham- 
berlain, of New York, in “A reply to Charles Francis Adams, jr.,” opposed atsome length 
the main position of Mr. Adams, that Greck should be optional in college. Hon. J. W. 
Patterson, superintendent of public instruction, New Hampshire,introduced “Indus- 
trial education,” and, among many other wise things, said that our systems of instruc- 
tion have conie down to us strong on the intellectual side but weak on the practical. 
“Natural history in schools” was well presented by Miss Lucretia Crocker, supervisor 
of Boston schools. Hon. John D. Philbrick, ex-superintendent of Boston public 
schools, in discussing “‘ Reform of the tenure of the teacher’s office,” very justly said 
that the pivotal question in pedagogy is the question of the teacher. The funda- 
mentai requisite of a good school system is a desirable status for the teacher, and the 
indispensable requisite for such a status is certainty of position. 
The following resolutions were passed : 
“* Resolved, That, whereas the great advance made in the adoption of improved 
methods of instruction and school management is largely due to the intelligent super- 
vision of competent educational experts, we desire to call the attention of school 
authorities, particularly in sparsely settled districts, to the importance of adopting 
plans which shall give to the schools the benefit of such supervision, 
“* Resolved, That we reaffirm the sentiments heretofore expressed many times by 
this institute in support of the National Bureau of Education and in appreciation 
of the great value and importance to the cause of education of the work it is doing.” 
John Fiske, LL. D., then gave his lecture on ‘‘ Manifest destiny,” after which Presi- 
dent Sprague, in afew well chosen words, introduced the president elect, Hon. J. W. 
Patterson, of New Hampshire, and the fifty-fifth annual meeting of the American 
Institute of Instruction adjourned. 
FROBEL INSTITUTE OF NORTH AMERICA. 
The second annual meeting of the Frébel Institute was held July 15-18, 1884, at 
Madison, Wis., the president, W. N. Hailmann, of La Porte, Ind.,in the chair. After 
the annual address of the president a number of others were given, among which 
were the following : ‘‘How can the friends of Frébel be organized for efficient local 
work?” ‘How should efficient training schools be organized?” ‘The benefits that 
may be expected from charity Kindergiirten,” and ‘‘To what extent should primary 
teachers be familiar with Kindergarten methods?” Before adjournment a committee 
was appointed to take the necessary steps for securing the organization of a Kinder- 
garten section in the National Teachers’ Association. It was resolved, however, that 
the identity of the Frébel Institute be retained and meetings of it be held as often 
as practicable. 
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. 
This body held its regular session at Washington, D. C., April 15-18, 1884. Among 
the subjects presented were ‘‘ The sufficiency of terrestrial rotation to deflect river 
courses ;” “The origin of crystalline rocks;” ‘‘On the photographs of the transit of 
Venus ;” ‘ Zodlogical results of the deep-sea dredging expedition, United States Fish 
Commission steamer Albatross ;” ‘‘On the depths of the western part of the Atlantic 
Ocean and Gulf of Mexico,” with an exhibition of a relief model; ‘“ On the relative 
levels of the western part of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, with respect to

the Gulf Stream ;” “‘ On the existence of tin ore in the older rocks of the Blue Ridge,” 
&c. Professor Gallaudet, of the Nationa! Deaf-Mute College, spoke of some recent 
results of the oral and aural teaching of the deaf, illustrating his remarks hy convers- 
ing with a deaf-mute boy, a student of the college. The boy read speech from the 
professor’s lips and replied in tones usually understood by the audience. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
This association was organized in 1847 and held its thirty-fifth annual meeting in 
Washington, D. C., May 6-9, 1884, with 590 names registered. A. ¥. P. Garnett, M.D, 
called the meeting to order, and President Austin Flint, M. p., delivered the opening 
address, in which he said the object of the association was to promote improvement 
in medical instruction and to advance the standard of medical acquirements; that 
the terms cultivation and advancement of medical knowledge implied progression ; 
that the time would come when means would be found to destroy morbilic agents 
outside of the body, thus securing prevention of disease. and means would be found 
to destroy the agent within the body, and thereby afford the power to arrest the 
. course of disease. Other addresses were delivered on medicine, diseases, dentis' 
surgery, and anatomy. 
AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The sixteenth annual session of this body was held in Hanover, N. H., July § 
1884, President M. L. D’Ooge in the chair. After the election of new members pz 
were read on “The theory and function of the thematic vowel in the Greek verb’ 
‘On a group of Sanscrit derivatives.” “The historical method and purpose in phi- 
lology” was the subject of an address delivered by the president, in which he con- 
gratulated American scholars upon the successful opening of the American School of 
Classical Studies at Athens and the work at Assos by the Archeological ee 
both of which institutions give promise of doing much for the honor of American 
scholarship and of promoting the study of classical philology in this country. Other 
subjects were briefly discussed, among them, “Primary and secondary sutiixes of de- 
rivation and their exchanges,” ‘On the relation of the Anglo-Norman vowel system 
to the Norman words in English,” and ‘The influence of written English and of the 
linguistic authorities upon spoken English.” Professor March, chairman of the ad vy 
    
      mittee on the reform of English spelling, reported no very active movement in regard 
to the spelling reform, and proposed starting a periodical called Language, in which | 
the spelling recommended by the Philological Association should be used. | 
SPELLING REFORM ASSOCIATION. 
The ninth annual meeting of this association was held at Hanover, N. I., July 10, 
1884. President March delivered an address, reviewing the history of the reform move- 
ment, which he said it was in contemplation to prepare an alphabetie vocabulary, 
with amended forms of all the ordinary English words susceptible of amendment. 
NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS. | 
3, The regular semiannual meeting of this association was held in Boston, May 
1884, Mr. J. L. Brewster, of Lawrence, in the chair. The one subject for consideration 
in the meeting was the ‘Teaching of reading.” W. T. Harris, Lu. D., of Concord, 
Mass., said that the objects of teaching reading are two: first, to enable the pupil to 
understand for himself the literature he is reading ; and, second, to enable him to read 
the printed pageso that others may understand it. Superintendent G. I. Aldrich, in 
“Choice of methods,” said the method employed must be based on correct principles, 
such as will make learning to read as pleasant as possible. Superintendent W. F. Gordy, 
of Ansonia, in ‘‘ The sentence method,” defined the two kinds of reading as eye reading 
and oral reading, the first of primary importance, and said that the child passes from 
thought to expression. W. H. Lambert, of Malden, in ‘Supplementary reading,” 
declared it to be a futile attempt to hold a child’s attention to a reading exercise which 
had become devitalized by rereading, and that supplementary reading cultivates a 
habit of reading, creates a taste for good reading, and teaches a child how to reas 
Superintendent Bates, of Hingham, said the child’s reading is constantly leading him 
into difficulties, and that teachers should instruct the child how to use the dictionary by 
careful drill. Superintendent George A. Littlefield, in his remarks on ‘‘ Public libraries 
and schools,” said judicious supplementary books were needed ; that the time of eve! 
lesson should be economized and common pieces should be read but once. Superin- 
tendent W. E. Pulsifer, on “Silent reading vs. elocution,” said: ‘¢ Elocution as ai 
art should be studied, for it yields to the world much that makes it happier an 
better; good reading as a vocal exercise is the epiepes expression of thought an 
feeling in speaking tones; but,” the speaker added, “‘the fact remains that the _~ 
mass of chidren need to be so trained that they can grasp the meaning of the printe

page by silent reading; and, in view of the fact that our boys and girls drift into ~ 
paths of vice from the baneful influence of bad literature, pupils should be taught 
what as well as how to read.” 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
This association held its eighth annual session at Cleveland, Ohio, July 2-4, 1884, 
its object being for mutual improvement by interchange of ideas and the broadening 
of the culture in music. After the address of welcome by Hon. George A. Ely, and 
reply by the president, E. M. Bowman, papers were read and addresses delivered on 
“Musical art creation in America, and the relation of music teachers thereto,” ‘‘ Vocal 
culture,” ‘An American school of composition,” “Elocution in its relation to the 
musician,” ‘The art of teaching,” “‘ Organ playing,” ‘‘ The requirements necessary for 
a teacher of vocal music,” ‘“ ee: to practise,” “Sight reading and cultivation of 
the ear,” and “‘ The necessity of accurate mechanical powers to a higher development 
of musical sense.” It was resolved to institute three grades of examination for teach- 
ets of music, a first and highest grade comprehending a mastery of the science and 
art of music; those successfully passing this examination will be entitled to a. 
diploma and the degree of master of musical art, those passing a successful examina~ 
tion in the intermediate grade will receive a diploma and the degree of fellow of the 
American College of Musicians, and those passing the third or lower grade will be 
rewarded with a diploma and membership in the American College of Musicians. 
CONFERENCE OF OFFICERS OF PRISONS AND REFORMATORIES. 
A conference of wardens of penitentiaries and superintendents of reformatories was 
held in Chicago, commencing December 9, 1884. Maj. R.W. McClanghry, warden of 
the Illinois State penitentiary, called the conference to order; Mr. Charles E. Felton, 
of Chicago, was appointed temporary chairman, and Fred. H. Wines, secretary of 
the Illinois State board of charities, secretary. The object of the association, as 
expressed in the opening address by Mr. Felton, was to discuss the details of the prac- 
tical workings of prison and reformatory institutions and to consider the practical 
questions growing out of them, hoping to profit by a comparison of views. An ad~ 
‘dress of welcome was delivered by Hon. Carter H. ettagh; mayor of Chicago. Ad- 
dresses followed from Rev. Mr. Wines, Warden Nicholson, of the Detroit House of 
Correction, Mr. C. E. Felton, who spoke on prison labor, Mr. Round, and many others. 
Such questions were considered as the government, discipline, employment, and in- 
struction of prisoners and youth in reformatories, all-the papers and addresses being 
quite fully discussed by the conference. 
BUSINESS EDUCATORS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its sixth annual convention at Rochester, N. Y., July 17-24, 
1884, President Charles E. Cady in the chair, with 83 members present. Hon. C. R. 
Parsons, mayor of the city, delivered the address of welcome, offering hearty sup- 
port. President Cady, in his annual address, declared the object of the convention 
to be “to canvass and discuss methods of teaching and courses of study, and gener- 
ally to promote the cause and elevate the standard of business education,” and 
added that the work undertaken by its members in preparing the young for useful 
and honorable employment was the noblest work in which a man could engage. 
Among the subjects brought forward and discussed were, ‘‘ Book-keeping,” ‘‘ Penman- 
ship,” ‘‘ Commercial calculations,” The relations of business colleges to public schools,” 
‘Penmanship and photo-engrarving,” ‘‘ Business correspondence,” “Commercial law,” 
“Shorthand,” “College discipline,” “.Phonography,” ‘Business practice,” ‘“ Clas- 
sification of accounts and closing books,” ‘The English language,” ‘The stenograph,” 
“Students’ rights and teachers’ duties,” “Box and package making,” ‘ Morals and 
manners,” ‘The ethics of commerce,” ‘‘Commercial arithmetic,” “Political econ- 
omy,” ‘ Takigraphy,” ‘‘ Parlimentary law in business colleges,” ‘‘ Relation of business 
colleges to agriculture,” ‘Business methods and practice,” and the “ Influence of 
business colleges on the destiny of American women.” 
AMERICAN ARTICULATION TEACHERS OF THE DEAF. 
The third annual convention of this association was held in New York City, June 
25-28, 1884. Prof. A. Graham Bell, chairman of the meeting, remarked upon the im- 
portance of the work and the nature and progress of articulation in this and other 
' countries, and stated that since the convention of 1874 the number of articulation 
teachers has largely increased, there being now in the United States and Canada about 
125; that we have 58 institutions for the instruction of the deaf, containing more 
than 7,000 pupils, but that these are nos sufficient to meet the demand. Interesting 
papers were read on “An American system of teaching articulation,” ‘How shall our 
children be taught to read?” “Speech reading,” ‘(Aural instruction of the semi-deaf,” 
&ec. Prof, A. Graham Bell was chosen president for the ensuing year.

  Healthy and harmonious growth. Promotes natural growth of the 
muscles, awakens percep- tion, cultivates taste in de- sign, and makes children more thoughtful, sympathet- ic, and happy. 
Very gratifying; many of the 
children, admitted to the 
home are considerably en- feebled in body and mind, 
and nothing else could so help to awaken the mental faculties and give strength and skill to the useless fin- 
gers. With the brighter children the results are very 
satisfactory. 
Develops harmoniously the physical, mental, and moral 
powers of the child. 
Develops the physical and 
mental natures without fore- 
ing either, and the child 
Jearns to combine the alpha- bet of knowing with that of 
doing. 
Promotes healthy physical and 
mental growth, and prepares the child for the more rigid 
discipline of the public 
school. 
All that is claimed for it by 
any intelligent advocate. 
Improves the child physically and mentally, teaches him to be unselfish,’ trains the oye and hand, strengthens the memory, and develops ideas of number. 
Strengthens the muscles, cul- tivates the observing powers, and develops the mental fac- ulties generally. 
Produces the happiest results ; the natural and pleasing in- centives to effort arouse and 
interest the dormant minds, make sensitive and skilful 
the feeble hands, and put body and mind into a 
healthier condition than 
former methods have done.

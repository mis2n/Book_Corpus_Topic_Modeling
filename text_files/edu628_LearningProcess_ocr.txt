PREFACE 
In the present work the attempt has been made to 
analyze the fundamental conceptions and facts relative 
to the learning process, and to show their significance by 
discussion and illustration as it appears in theory and 
practice in instruction in the elementary and the secondary 
schools. A wider application also has been made in so far 
as these theories and facts have been considered in rela- 
tion to the learning of the mature student and in the con- 
duct of the affairs of daily life. The materials for discussion 
have been drawn principally from the results of experi- 
mental psychology and pedagogy. Theoretical considera- 
tions in the fields of psychology and biology nave also 
been made use of from time to time. 
For aid in the preparation of this manuscript, by means 
of helpful suggestions, I have to thank particularly my 
colleagues, Professor W. C. Bagley and Professor B. H. 
Bode, and for material assistance in the revision of proof, 
my colleague, Dr. A. H. Sutherland. My thanks are also 
due to Professor E. B. Titchener, of Cornell University, 
for a detailed statement of certain aspects of his doctrine 
of attention, particularly in relation to his distinction 
between attributive and cognitive clearness.

CHAPTER I 
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS IN THE LEARNING PROCESS . ‘ I 
The learning process defined. — The possibility of trans- 
mitting acquired characters. — The influence of the social 
milieu. 
Learning cannot be accounted for in mere physiological 
terms.— Various definitions of consciousness are entirely 
inadequate. — Consciousness from the standpoint of adjust- 
ment. — Consciousness not a thing but a process. — Mental 
elements group themselves in terms of purpose. 
The two principal criteria for the appearance of conscious- 
ness, structure, and behavior. — Mere response to stimulation 
not an evidence of mental life. — Educability and response to 
a novel situation marks of intelligence. 
Various codrdinations possessed by animals at birth. — 
Learning through trial and error, through imitation, and 
through the formation of free ideas. 
The nature of the learning process in children similar to 
_ that of animals. — A completed experience is motor as well 
as sensory.— The first objects in the child’s world those to 
which he adequately reacts. — The pragmatic character of 
learning. — Curiosity and play in learning. 
CHAPTER II 
RACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF 
» LEARNING . ; ; : ; : : 4 . 
Possibilities of educating the race through social inheri- 
tance. — The teacher must make the pupil socially effective. — 
The necessity for special education for the genius as well as 
the defective. — The entire mass must be educated to its high- 
est efficiency. — The schools must discover efficiency. 
Effort should be made to narrow the field of trial and error

in all formal instruction. — The teacher must limit the field 
of the pupil’s exploration. — Dangers of bringing university 
methods into primary and secondary education. 
The educative method of nature.—The environment to 
which education seeks to adapt the individual is future and 
ideal. — Educational ideals of various periods of history. 
Education must makc use of the child’s capacities in all 
stages of his learning.— The child’s interests are not exclu- 
sively selfish and practical. 
The importance of self-expression in the education of the 
child. 
CHAPTER III 
REFLEX-ACTION, INSTINCT, HABIT . : ; . ° ° 
The relation of consciousness to reflex activity. 
The nature of impulsive activities. — Instinctive activity as 
distinguished from simple reflex activity. — A list of the most 
important human instincts. — Classification of the instincts 
from the genetic standpoint. — Egoistic and altruistic in- 
stincts; personal and impersonal instincts; the adaptive 
instincts. 
Gradual appearance of instincts. — Instincts made perma- 
nent through expression. — Variability of instinct. — The 
modification of instincts. 
Pleasure and pain further or inhibit activity as the case may 
be. — Pleasure the accompaniment of adequate adjustment. 
The neural basis of habit: — Comparison of habit with other 
‘non-voluntary activities. — Experimental results in regard to . 
the formation of habits. — Improvement in learning rapid at 
first, then it proceeds more slowly. — Plateaus in learning. — 
The appearance of helpful variation. — Factors that aid or 
hinder in learning. —’The importance of the proper intel- 
lectual attitude in learning. — Other significant factors in 
learning. 
Consciousness appears only when a need exists. — Habits 
of thought and feeling accompanied by consciousness, but 
not directed by it.— The method of thought may be quite 
mechanical. —Incomplete habits require consciousness. — 
Intellectual processes involve habits of attention.— Thought 
complexes require conscious direction in their coordination. — 
When new ideals arise the thought processes are less habitual 
than when these ideals are long established.

It is contended that all habits are specific. —There are 
various senses in which the term generalized habit may be 
used.—A specific stimulus calling forth a definite response 
may be common to a large variety of situations. — A specific 
reaction may take place as the result of a dominant mood. — 
A complex set of activities may function in various situations. 
Habit facilitates response, but deadens consciousness. — 
The human being must not reduce his entire life to mecha- 
nism.— The human environment infinitely complex. — The 
possibility of forming new habits.

be modified. — Substitution, not prohibition, must be the rule. 
— Importance of the play instinct. — Value of other adaptive. 
instincts. — The function of undesirable instincts. — Reward 
and ptnishment. — Envy, jealousy, and anger. — The instincts 
of adolescence. — The development of instincts as related to 
promotion in the school. — The suppression of instincts and 
mental arrest.

ing proper habits. — Desirable habits must be practiced on all 
occasions. — The avoidance of plateaus in habit formation. — 
The necessity of interest in directing habit formation. — The 
c fluctuation of interest in extended learning. — Habit formation 
should not be a means, but an end of learning.

_“ SENSATION AND PERCEPTION . 4 : ce g : 
We must treat learning from the standpoint of conscious- 
ness as well as of adjustment. 
Difficulty of defining sensation.— A sensory experience is 
sensory-motor. — It is actu2’'7 a perception. 
Sensation at the basis of all knowledge. — Sensation and 
especially perception ca~ “~ a degree be subjectively deter- 
mined. 
The infant’s sensory experience less rich than that of the 
adult, except in certain particulars. SBS

Possibility of educating children with marked sensory de- 
fects. — Slight sensory defects cannot be ignored. — Defects 
in vision and hearing as met in the schools. — Sensitivity of 
defectives and delinquents less than that of normal individuals.

Berlin and Plauen. — Hall’s experiments and conclusions. — 
Similar experiments at Annaberg, Zwickau, and Varde.—

Experiences of the child must be meaningful. — Children 
should be tested for sensory defects. — Danger of dwelling 
too long on the concrete. — The child’s experience must be 
extended beyond the home environment. — The suggestibility 
of children raises the question of the desirability of teaching 
fable and myth in the grades. 
CHAPTER VII ( 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF IMAGINATION . ne 5 ee és 
Imagination not capricious fancy. —It deals with an object 
of sensory experience not immediately present to the senses. 
— Attempts to define the mental image in physiological terms 
unsatisfactory. — Introspective analysis of the mental image. 
— Definition of the mental image as an object not immediately 
present to the senses distinguishes between imagination and 
false perception. 
Difference between mental image and percept in terms of 
types of reaction. — Eventually both image and percept must 
be measured in terms of adequate adjustment. — Two reasons 
that have led to imagination being considered unreal. PAGB

    INTRODUCTION 
THE point of view that is held to throughout the follow- 
ing discussion in the interpretation of the learning proc- 
ess, and the states of consciousness attendant on it, is a 
thoroughgoing functionalism and pragmatism. It is as- 
sumed that the reactions of an organism, its modes of 
behavior, furnish not merely the criteria for an objective 
determination of the learning processes of the organism, 
but that these reactions constitute the means by which 
the learning takes place. ( Without reactions learning 
would be impossible; behavior is essential in learning at 
all stages of development, both in the child and in the 
race. There is no learning that does not express itself 
in adjustment; there is no learning that is not acquired 
through adjustment. Thus the adjustments become the 
function by which learning is made possible, and the prac- 
tical significance of learning is measured in terms of the 
successful character of these adjustments. ) 
It should not be assumed for this reason, however, that 
the conscious correlates of these adjustments, ranging from 
the simplest sensations to the most complex rational proc- 
esses, and tinged by feelings and emotions of greater or 
of less intensity, are to be ignored, or to be passed over 
slightingly. The fact that adjustment is necessary for 
learning does not imply that the conscious factor is not 
also an essential. Consciousness appears as the accom- 
paniment of all complicated adjustments; possibly as the 
accompaniment of all adjustments, even of those of the 
most simple nature. What the relation is that exists be- 
tween the adjustments and the conscious processes that 
appear in connection with them, it may be difficult to 
xxi
-P-A-G-E-20
  XXii Introduction 
decide. Whether consciousness causes these adjustments 
or is caused by them, or whether, finally, there is no actual 
causal relation existing between conscious states and the 
bodily processes connected with them, but rather such a 
relation that they appear together without any interaction, 
is a matter not for an empirical science, but for philosophy 
to determine. Whatever the relation may be, whether 
of interaction (2.e. direct causal connection) or of concomi- 
tant variation (2.¢. a parallel relation between bodily and 
mental processes without actual causal connections), it 
must be assumed from the empirical point of view, that 
consciousness is practical; that it arises in a clear form 
when there is a need for it (z.e. when the organism can no 
longer adequately adjust itself in a reflex or mechanical 
way). Consciousness, therefore, is always useful, and exists 
only as long as it can be of service. This is its prag- 
matic sanction. Its existence is conditioned on its service 
to the organism, this service being that of adequately ad- 
justing the organism to its environment. 
When we turn toa more detailed examination of con- 
sciousness itself, and inquire into the manner in which the 
elements that compose it group themselves, we discover 
that this grouping obeys a fundamental law that differen- 
tiates conscious phenomena in a striking way from those 
of the material world. Material phenomena obey the law 
of efficient causality, the law that asserts that every effect 
is traceable to a preceding cause, or a series of causes, that 
absolutely condition it. In the world of matter complete 
determinism prevails; the present is accounted for entirely 
and adequately in terms of the past. 
Conscious phenomena, on the other hand, group them- 
selves under the law of purpose or end. A conscious 
event cannot be given an adequate explanation in terms of 
efficient causality. It is not what has gone before, but what 
is in the future, that explains the way in which mental 
processes develop. In the highest forms of conscious
-P-A-G-E-21
  Introduction Xxilli 
groupings we have clearly defined ends, wnich are held in 
the mind and in which the conscious processes terminate; 
we meet here the phenomena of deliberation, comparison, 
and choice that are the characteristics of volition. Here 
the purpose is explicit, the aim recognized. Below the 
level of deliberative choice and conscious adjustment to 
ends more or less remote, we have still conscious group- 
ings that are dominated by purpose in a less explicit sense. 
Desire and impulse, if the adjustment is not purely au- 
tomatic, point to something beyond, something not yet 
realized, but to be attained. The desire regulates the 
groupings in this stage of consciousness, just as truly as 
does the more definite purpose regulate the thought proc- 
esses in rational and deliberative modes of behavior. Even 
in the subconscious realm the groupings are to be explained, 
if explicable at all, in terms of consciousness rather than 
in terms of mere nerve physiology. Here, it is assumed, 
exists an unrecognized end that dominates these states of 
mind. 
The explanation of conscious phenomena in terms of pur- 
pose will be often met in the following pages. This ex- 
planation will appear in the discussion of perception, of 
memory and association, of interest and attention, and 
particularly it will be emphasized in the chapters on the 
higher thought processes. Indeed, wherever conscious 
processes are discussed it will be shown that whatever the 
source of the elements that constitute those processes may 
be, and whatever the explanation for the emergence of 
these elements in consciousness, the fundamental law by 
which they are arranged is always to be conceived as some 
form of purpose or end, either clearly observable or im- 
plicitly present. When no such purpose can be discovered, 
we must then conclude that we are dealing with phenomena 
whose explanation lies within the physiological or physical 
realm. 
In the discussions that are to follow there will likewise
-P-A-G-E-22
- 
  XXIV | Introduction 
be found numerous references to the significance of adjust- 
ment in determining the nature of learning. The earlier 
chapters, which are primarily biological in their nature, 
will emphasize the factor of adjustment and the part that it 
plays in the learning of the individual and of the race. In 
the later chapters, in which the conscious aspects of learning 
are more particularly emphasized, the significance of adjust- 
ment as a mental factor will be discussed, and the motor 
aspects of consciousness will be given a large share in the 
structure of mental states. It will be insisted that adjust- 
ment and meaning go hand-in-hand, and that kinzsthesis 
is an indispensable factor in all forms of learning, from the 
lowest to the highest. 
Thus the attempt will be made to develop around these 
two basal concepts of adjustment and purpose a system of

tant facts that have been revealed by experimentation, ob- 
servation, and reflection. It will further be attempted to 
show in a concrete manner the application of the various 
facts and theories presented to the practical problems of 
education in the school and in the home. Much material 
will be found that may not seem to be necessarily included 
in the plan outlined above; that would, for example, be 
presented in a discussion in which other conceptions as to 
the meaning of the learning process and the nature of con- 
sciousness prevailed. The justification for the introduction 
of such material in a book that attempts to set forth, in 
part at least, a system of interpretation, is, that this material 
must be considered as final data; as ultimate elements 
which are to be organized in terms of the learning process. 
Mere desultory memory must be taken as a fact largely of 
physiological significance ; the instinctive interests must 
be accepted and interpreted as to their origin in biological 
terms; the physiological basis of fatigue must be recog- 
nized. On the other hand, all these and other similar data 
are to be dealt with in considering the principles of learn-

ing as the materials and circumstances from which, and 
conditioned by which, mental organization takes place. 
We cannot explain in physical concepts, origins in dealing 
with the cosmos. We take the ultimate elements for 
granted, and attempt to relate them in terms of physical 
laws. No more can we explain in psychological concepts 
the appearance of ultimate psychic elements. When they 
make their appearance we must accept them as given and at- 
tempt to relate them in terms of mentallaws. This does not 
preclude the treatment of the origins of mental elements in 
purely physical and physiological terms; it does, however, 
mean that we must frankly recognize that in these cases 
we are not on psychological ground; and it further means 
that we are justified in our physical or physiological treat- 
ment only in so far as we show the manner in which a — 
higher psychological treatment can be applied in the group- 
ing and functioning of these elements in mental complexes.

  THE LEARNING PROCESS 
CHAPTER I 
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS IN THE LEARNING PROCESS 
THE learning process may briefly be described in its most 
general terms as the modification of the reactions of an or- 
ganism through experience. An organism which shah 
is incapable of modification in its reactions can- ing process 
not be taught. Inusing the term “experience” %%"** 
we refer to the modification of adjustment in the individual 
organism as distinguished from those modifications’ that 
take place in racial development. Itis possible to conceive 
racial modifications as ina sensea gradual learning through 
the process of evolution. Racial learning consists either 
in the elimination of less fit forms through natural selec- 
tion, or in the acquisition of acquired characteristics by 
individuals, which latter can be transmitted to their de- 
scendants through heredity. 
The transmission of acquired characteristics (that is, of modifications” 
acquired during the life of the parent as a result of environmental con- 
ditions) to the offspring of that parent is at present generally considered 
improbable. Thomson, in his excellent discussion of this question in 
his treatise on “ Heredity,” concludes that there is slight scientific 
warrant for at present accepting the doctrine of acquired characters.1 
Although we may seriously question the possibility of 
securing the transmission of acquired modifications from one 
individual to another through inheritance, it is, neverthe- 
less, desirable from the standpoint of educational procedure 
to bring about such modifications, since they can be trans- 
mitted from individual to individual through the social me-

dium. Indeed, a large amount of the best things that have 
come to the race have been transmitted in this way. To 
Transmis- Use the words of Thomson, “ Unlike the beasts 
sion of ac- that perish, man has a lasting external heritage, ired char- : : 
ieee capable of endless modification for the better, a 
rough | heritage of ideas and ideals, embodied in prose 
environ- |§ and verse, in statue and painting, in cathedral 
ment. and university, in tradition and convention, and 
above all in society itself.” Thus from the standpoint of 
practical pedagogy, the question of the possibility of the 
transmission of acquired characteristics 1s one primarily of 
theoretical importance. It makes little difference to educa- 
tional procedure whether the modifications secured are 
transmitted directly from father to son, or are transmitted 
in a more roundabout way through the social environment, 
which has become modified through the education of the 
individuals that constitute the social group. } 
For example, if the possibility of the transmission of acquired modi- 
fications be admitted, we might assume that the perfecting of an indi- 
vidual, or a number of individuals, in the technique of playing some 
musical instrument might be perpetuated in the generations succeeding 
by the direct physical inheritance of this technique. Therefore, the edu- 
cation of such individuals would be of more than individual signifi- 
cance. On the other hand, the possibility of this wider education would 
still exist if direct inheritance of this musical technique were impossible, 
since the education of these first individuals would result in the educa- 
tion of others in their immediate environment, and these could transmit 
such education to still others, and so the process could be continued 
indefinitely, the final results being even greater than if the direct trans- 
mission alone were possible. 
The transmission of the modifications produced ‘in one 
generation by environmental conditions to succeeding genera- 
tions by means of, the social milieu is one of the striking 
differences between brute and human societies, and accounts 
in a large measure, for the infinitely greater progress of 
the human race than that of the brute creation.

  Fundamental Elements in the Learning Process 3 
While it is possible that in lower organisms modifications 
of experience may occur without a conscious accom pani- 
ment, in all higher learning the psychic factor is 
an indispensable consideration, and to attempt to evetae 
account for learning merely in physical and Oi sc 
physiological terms is totally inadequate. We 
must assume that wherever there is marked modification 
of animal behavior in the course of the life history of the 
organism, there exists a conscious element which must 
be accounted for in order adequately to explain the learn- 
ing. No consideration of the learning process which does 
not take into account the determining factor of mind, and 
make it a basal element in all learning, would be adequate. 
At the very outset of our discussion, then, it will be neces- 
sary to consider something of the nature, scope, and signifi- 
cance of consciousness. 
Many recent attempts have been made to give an ade- 
quate definition or description of consciousness. None 
of these has entirely succeeded. Indeed, it is Conscious- 
hardly to be expected that a completely satisfac. 3°55 ig 
tory definition will ever be framed. Conscious- describing 
ness is the most fundamental and final fact of cee 
the universe. It is, therefore, impossible to give constitute it. 
a definition of consciousness in terms more elementary 
than consciousness itself. Most definitions have ended 
either by describing certain elements that go to make up 
consciousness, or in explaining consciousness in terms 
of the physical or physiological circumstances that con- 
dition it. 
For example, some psychologists, in framing their definition of con- 
sciousness, do not attempt to do more than merely to enumerate the 
various aspects of our conscious experiences, such as perceiving, attend- 
ing, imagining, willing, and feeling. But in doing this they have 
simply called to mind experiences which have meaning only for those 
who possess them. While this procedure emphasizes these various 
aspects of consciousness, it throws no added light upon the nature of 
consciousness itself.
-P-A-G-E-28

  4 The Learning Process 
Again, in attempting to explain consciousness in terms 
of a physical stimulus and the resulting physiological pro- 
Conscious- CeSs, the nature of the stimulus is described as 
ness ex- well as the mechanical or chemical changes plained in . F : “ 
physiologic Which are droused by the stimulus affecting a 
calterms. sense organ, and the effects are further traced 
through the nervous system to the appropriate brain 
centers. 
{For example, fin the sense of vision the physical waves of light are | 
analyzed and described, the chemical changes that occur when these 
light waves fall on the retina are considered, and the physiological pro- 
cesses in the visual centers of the brain are discussed. The facts and 
hypotheses involved in this procedure, while interesting and not unim- 
portant, do not reveal to us the final nature of the visual experiences of 
color and light. 
Obviously, such a description as this is a description in 
terms that are extramental, and which presuppose a rela- 
tion between consciousness and the physical world that is 
hypothetical and in a measure unsatisfactory. 
Although consciousness cannot be adequately defined, 
there are certain important aspects of it which should be

phenome- has been an increasing tendency to consider con- 
a sciousness from the biological standpoint, treat- 
ing it as the means by which the organism secures a 
_ proper adjustment to its environment. The more complex 
and variable this adjustment, the greater the complexity 
and variability of consciousness. On the lower level of 
habitual action, consciousness, as a determining factor, 
may be disregarded, and for all practical purposes treated 
as non-existent. However, on these lower levels the ques- 
tion of actual learning does not occur. Wherever there ts 
variability in response, there we may assume 1s a conscious- 
ness, which may be legitimately interpreted as being instru- 
mental in this response.

  Fundamental Elements in the Learning Process 5 
As James has so clearly pointed out, consciousness is not 
a thing, but a process. To understand its nature, it cannot, 
therefore, be adequately studied as static, but as ! . . Conscious- something flowing on towarda more or less defi- ness not 
nite goal under the dominance of certain laws. ee as 
The following analogy may serve to illustrate. 
the difference between consciousness as a process and con- 
sciousness as a mere unrelated set of occurrences. Ona 
June evening, we are often attracted by the countless fire- 
flies as they flash forth ‘in points of light in the darkness 
and then disappear from view. Between these points of 
light there seems to be no connection, and the flashes 
appear in no apparent order. So consciousness might be 
pictured as sparks of intelligence glowing here and there 
on the dark background of the unconscious. This may be 
a true picture of the most primitive forms of intelligence, 
but with such intelligence the present discussion has noth- 
ing todo. The light of consciousness that we are to con-> 
sider forms an uninterrupted train of brightness, and the 
point from which it issues and the goal in which it termi- 
nates can be traced with relative definiteness. Comscious- 
ness ts an event, or better, a series of related events, 
harmoniously joined and leading to a final conclusion. — 
Perhaps the most important viewpoint from which we 
may consider consciousness is that of the fundamental law 
which underlies all conscious groupings. AS the most

be explained as due to a preceding set of efficient causes 
that absolutely predetermine every physical occurrence. 
In the interpretation of the phenomena of this world, all 
purpose, design, and aim must be rigorously excluded. /n 
the world of consciousness, however, the reverse ts true. No

causality. The real explanation of a grouping, or constella 
tion of conscious factors, 1s to be found in the meaning or 
end around which they are grouped. In order to satisfac- 
torily account for the appearance and grouping of mental 
states, we must be able to show the end, aim, or purpose 
toward which the mental processes are moving. Where we 
cannot show an end, either consciously or subconsciously 
present, we have a materialistic rather than a psychical 
explanation. 
The question naturally arises: At what point in the-ani- 
mal series does consciousness first appear? A _ similar 
dati query asks: At what point in the development 
principal of the individwal does consciousness arise? Nei- 
a for__ ‘ther question can be easily answered. Logically,

sciousness. ~onscious and the unconscious, neither in the 
animal series nor in man. On the other hand, it is quite 
evident that consciousness in any significant and valuable 
form can hardly be assumed to exist in the lower levels of 
animal life and in the human individual in his prenatal 
development. Certain specific criteria for the appearance 
of consciousness have been suggested by various writers, 
but they reduce themselves in the main to two, namely: 
first, the argument from similarity of bodily structure (par- 
ticularly of the nervous system) to the similarity of con- 
scious states arising in connection with bodily processes, 
and second, the argument from similarity of behavior to 
the similarity of the mental phenomena accompanying this 
behavior. 
Among the higher vertebrates, including man, the re- 
semblance between the central nervous systems of the va-

ture and the end organs connected with the central nervous

system (the eye, the ear, etc.) become less marked, and, as 
the higher centers become relatively less important and 
finally disappear, the probability of a conscious life similar 
to that existing in the higher organisms grows less. When 
we arrive at the final stage in the descent, we find the 
amoeba, a single-celled, structureless bit of protoplasm, 
without a nervous system even of the most rudimentary 
sort. If consciousness exists in such an organism, it cer- 
‘tainly cannot be inferred from its structural resemblance 
to that of those higher animals in which we must assume 
that a psychic life is present. 
When we turn to the criterion of behavior, as indicative 
of consciousness, we find greater evidence of a widely ex- 
tended psychic life than we do when weconsider 4. ite 
structural resemblances alone. There is, indeed, rion of be- 
but slight resemblance in structure between the ™%* 
amoeba and man, yet the behavior of these lowest forms 
of animal life is not absolutely unlike that of the highest 
forms. Indeed, Jennings?! has asserted that were the 
amoeba an animal as commonly observed as the house 
dog, to it would be attributed, because of its behavior, 
a consciousness not dissimilar to that of the rudimentary 
processes of the higher animals. 
While behavior, or movement, is in generalan indication 
of consciousness, not all movement should be taken as 
showing evidence of mental life. Mere re- Mikaeds 
sponse to stimulation is characteristic of all sponse to 
protoplasm. In this connection the biological “oe 
theory of tropisms may be noted as set forth by dence of 
Loeb and others. Loeb says: “The tropisms ™°™ Mf 
are identical for animals and plants.’ They are mechani-

Amceba were a large animal, so as to come within the everyday experience 
of human beings, its behavior would at once call forth the attribution to it of 
states of pleasure and pain, of hunger, desire, and the like, on precisely the 
same basis as we attribute these things to the dog.”

cal in their nature, and depend on the specific irritability 
of certain elements of the body’s surface.’ In organisms 
relatively high in the scale of existence, as well as in those 
of lower orders, a large number of bodily movements must 
be considered as being initiated entirely within the nervous 
system, and in no way directly connected with conscious 
processes. Reflex and automatic activity are of this type. 
Only those activities that are classed under the head of pur- 
posive reactions can be taken as necessarily tmplying con- 
sciousness. Purposive reactions, so called, are not to be 
considered as evidences of consciousness, unless it can 
be shown that the purpose is internal. The reaction, for 
example, of plants to light and to other stimuli has been 
interpreted under the concept of purpose; however, this 
alleged purpose is not an end of action as we ordinarily 
understand the term. 
One of the marks of “ internally purposive,” or voluntary 
movements, is that they do not appear with mechanical

amarkof mental conditions. Anorganism that varies its 
intelligence. reactions in this way evidently profits bydexperi- 
ence, and thus shows educability. It must be assumed 
that any animal that is capable of modifying its behavior 
in an essential way through experience is possessed of an 
intelligence of a fairly high order. To the criterion of 
educability may be added that of response to a novel situ- 
ation. The significance of this latter criterion will be pointed 
out more fully in a subsequent part of this discussion. 
Here it is sufficient to say that the habitual, the customary, 
the common, remain in the realm of the subconscious or the 
unconscious. Only when a thought crisis arises does a gen- 
uine experience occur. This thought crisis is due to the 
fact that the customary environment has been in some way 
changed, so that the habitual reaction is no longer possible,

and the thought processes necessary for the solution of the 
presented difficulty emerging in consciousness as a problem, 
accomplish an adjustment that was no longer possible on 
the lower level of habitual activity. 
Animals at birth, from the lowest to the highest forms, 
are equipped with certain codrdinations through which they 
are adapted, without previous experience, to their yarious co- 
environment. These codrdinationsare reflex and ordinations i 5 ie ; possessed

lower down the scale of animal life, at leastas faras the verte- 
brate series is concerned, the greater is the importance of 
these adjustments in the total reactions of the organism. 
‘The higher forms also possess at birth certain diffuse and 
uncoodrdinated reactions that seem to serve no immediate 
purpose, since they are not definite enough to bring about 
any helpful adjustments. An example of these latter 
reactions may be found in the ill-directed and seemingly 
wasteful movements of the infant, who on seeing a bril- 
liantly colored ball suspended before it, makes a multitude 
of movements, none of which may accomplish the result 
of obtaining the ball. The visual stimulus of the colored 
ball sets up in this particular instance a nervous activity 
that finds no direct and definite discharge, spreading it- 
self over the entire neryous system, innervating many 
muscles, but issuing in no successful series of adjustments. 
These diffuse movements, however, have an important func- 
tion, since from them, by a process of selection, are chosen 
certain movements that later on become of the greatest 
value in the adjustment of the organism to its environment. — 
Indeed, it is from the reflex, instinctive, and diffuse move- 
ments that the various complex adjustments of later life are 
developed. The learning process must make use of these 
primitive forms of adjustment in constructing the more 
complicated varieties that arise in the later experience of 
the organism. It is not so much that absolutely new.

adjustments are created, as that out of a large number of 
reflex and instinctive and diffuse activities, those that are 
most suitable for the proper adjustment of the organisms 
are selected.! 
One of the most important means by which the animal 
learns new adjustments is through trial and error.2. This 
i a is the hit-and-miss process by which, through g through trial slow stages of individual and racial experience,

are countless illustrations in the learning processes of 
man and brute alike of this method of arriving at more 
satisfactory adaptations to environmental conditions. In 
animal experimentation, this means of learning is the one 
which has been almost universally found to explain the 
behavior of the organisms studied. None of the lower 
animals seem capable of learning by any other means. The 
trial and error method is blind at the outset. A reaction 
is called for which has not beencompletely mastered. Re- 
peated failures correct themselves gradually, and finally a 
reaction suited to the situation is acquired. The process 
of trial and error is extremely slow and wasteful, and it has 
played the chief réle, not only in the learning of animals, 
but in the progress of the human race from savagery to 
civilization as well. Obviously such a method of learning 
is one which must be superseded in large measure by a 
1 This thought is clearly expressed and amplified by Dexter in the Aduca- 
tional Review, Vol. XXIII, pp. 81-91, 1902, in an article entitled “ Survival of 
the Fittest in Motor Training.” The writer says: “It is futile to attempt to 
teach a child a movement till the elements of the movement make their ap- 
pearance naturally, in accordance with the laws of growth.... When the 
new coordination first makes its appearance, it is easier to suppress its unfavor- 
able variations, and hence, in common parlance, to learn to act with precision. 
. . . Codrdinations which have previously been set up in accordance with 
the laws of growth, but have not at the opportune time been selected for sur- 
vival, may at a later period be made prominent, but not with the same ease, 
nor with the same success, as then.”

shorter and more efficient process in the higher forms of 
education.! | 
A concrete illustration of this method of learning is found in the so- 
called puzzle-box experiment, which, under various forms, has often 
been employed in testing the learning processes of animals of various 
degrees of intelligence. In one experiment of this type the animal is 
placed in a box provided with a door, and secured by a lock or bolt or 
some other similar device, while outside as a stimulus, or incentive to 
escape, is placed food. The animal may open the door and obtain his 
freedom by a few simple movements, such as pulling a string or turn- 
ing a button or sliding a bolt; but he goes about his task in a random 
fashion with no definite point of attack. He makes pawings or other 
‘haracteristic movements. Finally, and by mere chance, he hits upon 
the right method of opening the door, escapes, and is rewarded by 
obtaining food. When a second time he is placed in the box, he per- 
haps succeeds a little better; and finally, after many trials, he learns to 
open the door of the box immediately and with accuracy. In this hit- 
and-miss manner he has finally acquired a habit which adjusts him to 
the specific situation that confronts him. If, however, the method of 
opening the door is changed to a considerable degree, the animal will 
probably find himself helpless again, and must once more learn through 
trial and error how to adjust himself to the new conditions that con- 
front him. It is obvious, however, that if the animal could have . 
acquired, in the first series of reactions, a genera] notion or idea of pro- 
cedure, he could have applied this idea to the opening of the door under 
modified conditions. | 
This is the test of intelligent adaptability, namely, 
Can the individual adjust himself to a new situation with- 
out going through the slow process of trial and error, 
and secure an adequate set of reactions by means of his 
previous experience? In the last analysis, it is the aim of 
education to secure this adaptability. | 
The ability to form “free ideas,” as they have some- 
times been called, through which new situations are met 
and adequately solved, has quite generally been denied to

repeat themselves. ‘Increased vitality tends to enlarge- 
ment, range of movement, activity ; while lessened vitality 
and organic decay tend to the opposite series of effects, 
z.¢. shrinking, contraction of range, torpidity.” Excess 
activity, with its tendency to repeat a movement once 
initiated, manifests itself ‘‘in the whole range of motor 
accommodations, from the protozoa which swarm to the light 
to the most difficult feat of the acrobat.” The activities 
that come under the head of excess discharge, however, 
tend to form a circle of repetition, each succeeding one, in 
a sense, imitating the act that has gone before. 
An illustration of circular activity is found in the manner in which 
infants, during the latter period of their first year, begin to acquire the 
rudiments of/a language. The seemingly purposeless babblings of the 
little child, his ba-ba-bas, pa-pa-pas, and the like,"come under this prin- 
ciple of circular activity. The sounds, at first spontaneously hit upon, 
give a physiological pleasure to the infant, and they are thus repeated.

By such means as these the child unconsciously acquires a set of useful 
' adjustments which later on may be employed in a highly purposive 
manner. 
A large number of the activities of animals which are 
perfected by repetition really belong to this class of imita- 
tion through circular activity. While there is no directed 
learning here, we find in these cases nature’s most primi- 
tive attémpt to teach her children, 
Another sense in which “ imitation” is used may be de- 
scribed for lack of a better term by the name “ instinctive 
imitation,” z.e. the impulse to copy without the 
consciousness of purpose. This sort of imita- Mstinctive 
tion is found in herds of animals, in groups of 
children, and in mobs of adults. The flock of sheep follow 
their leader quite without any purpose of imitating his 
movements. Children manifest this same general tendency 
in their plays and games. A determined leader is all that 
is necessary to excite the mob to acts of greatest irration- 
ality. It is possible, because of this, to stampede conven- 
tions, lead bands of men to the cannon’s mouth, and even to 
change the fashions of speech and dress. A few religious 
enthusiasts, returning from the Holy Sepulcher during the 
*Crusades, set all of Europe dancing in an ecstatic frenzy. 
Few of us realize how much of our conduct, how large a 
proportion of our speech and manners, are traceable to this

from concrete experience general principles of procedure.

tions of an organism, not in an unconscious way, but because 
the past experience has been raised to the level of reflective 
consciousness, and its bearings upon the immediate situa- 
tion more or less clearly considered. The man who learns 
how to manipulate one piece of mechanical contrivance is 
better able to manipulate another that has certain aspects 
of similarity with the first, because he has been able to 
abstract from his earlier experience general points of view 
which are applicable in the new situation. Racial develop- 
ment is in no small measure due to the ability of human 
beings to employ this highest principle of learning. It has 
made social and individual progress possible. 
The methods by which the infant modifies his reactions

forms plays an important réle, especially, as has already 
been pointed out, in the acquisition of language. The

fecting the various end organs, all of which are functional 
in a more or less perfect way within a short time after 
birth. The fact that the child has these possi-

that he has any single completed experience, or 
that he has a world of definite objects of any A com-

  sort. Notonly must the sense organs themselves 
be capable of response to stimulation, but the proper con- 
nections with the higher nerve centers must be perfected. 
Such connections are in many instances lacking at birth. 
Further, in order that the child may, through sense stimuli, 
‘acquire a perception of the objects in the environment, it 
is necessary that he veact to the specific objects in this 
environment. It is an important \law of all learning that 
sense stimuli must be carried over into motor expression, 
manifesting themselves in: specific movements directed 
more or less-definitely toward or away from the source of 
stimulation. In other words, a completed experience ts not 
merely sensory, tt must be motor-as well, or, to put it in 
another way, an object is not merely something to be 
sensed, it is something likewise to be reacted to, and its 
meaning grows and develops as the reaction becomes more 
comprehensive, accurate, and satisfactory. An object is, 
in the last analysis, constituted by a set of definite and 
consistent reactions, 
The first things which a child knows in any real sense 
are those to which he has adequately reacted. Therefore, 
the first objects in his world to separate them- 
selves out from the confusion of his dawning obfectaiel 
consciousness, are those objects in connection the child’s

mental organic needs, the satisfaction of which must be 
accomplished prior to any extensive experience, if life is to 
be sustained. The most primitive movements, like suck-

ing, reveal to him the mother’s breast or the nursing bot 
tle as an object of definite experience: Later other objects 
which center around these organic needs and instincts, 
and to which he learns to adjust himself, become definite 
parts of his world, and gradually there evolve, out of the 
chaos of his beginning life, a few objective points, by 
which he reacts in an ever more adequate manner to his 
environment. 
The learning process, at least during the first months of 
the child’s life, is almost exclusively, if not completely, con- 
fined to gaining knowledge through the prac- 
ee tical necessities that confront him. This is a 
acter of fundamental law of learning for child and brute learning. ; ; ; 
alike, and covers the widest ranges of racial and 
individual experience. It is for this reason that knowledge 
7s termed practical or pragmatic. It becomes an instrument 
by which the proper adjustment ts accomplished. Thus 
learning develops as there is a need and in direct response 
to this need.. 
It is, however, an error to suppose that the only incen- 
tive to learning is of this directly and immediately practi- 
Curiosity cal character. The instinct of curiosity, which 
incentive to leads the organism to explore its environment 
ern beyond the immediately pressing aspects of that 
environment, has resulted in an extension of experience 
which has been of the greatest benefit. Thus finally curi- 
osity, which impels the organism to explore without any 
purpose beyond the satisfaction of that curiosity, becomes 
of the highest practical importance in the adaptation of 
the organism to its future environment. Curiosity is the 
means by which the individual stores up for future use in- 
formation which may serve in the time of need. It is this 
primitive impulse which in its highest development lies at 
the basis of scientific inquiry. 
Play, like curiosity, is an important factor in the learning 
process. It, too, has no ulterior motive, but finds satisfac-

ories in regard to play. Formerly the most commonly ex- 
pressed theory, the one advanced by Herbert ‘ : Play a fac- 
Spencer, held that play is to be explained as. tor in the

ism. Excess vitality leads to movements that 
have no utilitarian value. More recently Stanley Hall? 
has set forth the theory that play is atavistic; it is the 
rehearsal by the organism of certain ancestral activities that 
no longer possess utility. Doubtless, there is a truth in 
both of these theories, but the one which is most significant 
from the standpoint of the psychology of learning majn- 
tains that the real philosophy of play is that it is a prepa- 
ration for future activities. This is the standpoint of Karl 
Groos, as set forth in his works on the “Play of Animals,” 
and the “Play of Man.” Thus play, like curiosity, although 
it serves no immediate purpose, prepares the 01 organism for 
a future environment to which it must adequately adjust} 
itself for survival and progress. It thus appears that 
through curiosity and play both the child and the animal 
are capable of going beyond the immediate and practical 
environment, in this manner extending their control, so 
that they shall be better able to cope with those conditions 
that shall ultimately demand attention.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE GENERAL PRIN- 
CIPLES OF LEARNING 
WE have already seen that the education acquired by an 
individual 8 probability cannot be transmitted through 
Possibilities Physical inheritance to his descendants. The 
ofeduca~ skill gained in playing the piano ends with the tion through ; , 
social in- . person who has gained it, unless he teach the 
heritance. technique to others, or by his skill as a player 
inspire others to emulate him until they master the tech- 
nique that he has acquired. Zhe skill as such cannot be 
inherited. The son may be taught by the father, or be- 
cause he is reared in a musical environment, he may turn 
his attention to the learning of the technique of the piano 
or of some other musical instrument. This learning, how- 
ever, is not inherited, but it may become something vastly 
important in the scheme of education. If the skill were 
merely inherited, it could at the best be handed on but to 
a few by direct transmission. On the other hand, a great 
genius may profoundly affect many individuals in his gen- 
eration, and through affecting them cause the widest modi- 
_ fications in generations yet to come. 
Here lies the greatest opportunity and hope of an educa- 
tional system. The idividual must be so educated as to be 
Bia made socially effective. The educational] ideal 
must aim to must always have in mind the welfare primarily 
San. a of the social group, rather than of the separate 
cially individuals that compose that group. It should, 
effective. therefore, be the aim of the teacher to make the 
pupil socially efficient to a maximal degree, and he should 
give his best and highest efforts to those pupils who pos-

sess the greatest talents, particularly if these talents are 
joined with evident possibilities of social dominance. The 
mediocre pupil may be raised through the efforts of the 
teacher to a moderate degree of efficiency, but it is doubt- 
ful whether the teacher can make such a pupil sufficiently 
effective to modify to any marked degree the mz/ieu in 
which that pupil is placed. 
It may be seriously questioned whether the democratic , 
ideals of a similar opportunity for all in education should 
not be radically modified. If the aim of educa- phe neces- 
tion is to-promote social efficiency, then it is sity of : ‘ : providing 
perfectly obvious that this a.m can be realized special edu- 
not by giving eqiil opportunities of education ¢#o2- 
to all, irrespective of their individual abilities, but by select- 
ing the most capable and by giving these special oppor- 
tunity. We recognize to-day the necessity of providing 
special education for mentally backward and defective 
children. We justify these special schools in part because 
we argue that these defectives may be educated sufficiently 
to be made self-supporting. Very largely, however, the 
reason for the existence of such schools is to be explained 
as due to the sympathy which society has in the unfortu- 
nate class as such, apart from any consideration of the 
social value of these defectives. Every argument that 
applies to the special treatment of the subnormal classes, 
applies with far greater-force to special opportunities for 
_ those possessing superior talent or genius. The education 
_ of the talented pupil up to his highest potentialities means 
a tremendous social asset. For this reason the most ad- 
vanced and most specialized schools should be supported 
by the state; schools from which no individual is theoreti- 
cally debarred, but which only the few who have the 
greatest abilities can actually enter." :

  20 The Learning Process 
It would be a wrong inference, however, to conclude 
that, because there is a special need for educating the 
talented child to the fullest extent, the middle 
Se Loe class of children should be ignored. Even if 
ever, should we should maintain that the great mass of chil- be educated

ronment that is hostile to him, and does not comprehend or 
sympathize with his aims and purposes. Therefore, she 
great mass of children must be educated to their highest 
efficiency in order that the soctal tdeal may be realized. 
It is not that education should do less for them than it 
does at present; it doubtless should do more. On the 
other hand, the necessity of providing a special and superior 
education of the few most capable individuals must be 
clearly recognized if our social progress is to be sat- 
isfactory. 
The standards of efficiency in the schools are not to be 
too narrowly interpreted. Efficiency must be recognized

greatest ability. Provision must be made for 
the discovery of efficiency of all sorts by offering oppor- 
tunities in the school curriculum for the expression of 
varied ability. The recent emphasis of industrial training 
is most important in this connection. The advance that is 
being made in the psychology of individual differences is 
likewise of promise.! 
1 Applied psychology is recognizing more and more the necessity of study- 
ing the individual as distinguished from the mass. In Germany, under the 
leadership of Stern, Lipmann, and others, extensive plans are being perfected 
for the determination of those factors which are important in individual vari- 
ation. The psychology of individual differences is particularly important in

principles of machinery, on attempting to operate a new 
machine, will be obliged to investigate it in order to dis- 
cover just how it works. However, in this try-out there 
are many details which he will not attempt to investigate, 
because his general knowledge will give him information 
concerning them. There are some particulars, however, 
which he must discover by actually trying how the machin- 
ery works. ‘The person unskilled in the use of machinery

the children so graded are recognized as separate individuals with peculiarities 
and capacities which demand oftentimes particular treatment. It is no 
longer possible, in the light of modern investigations, to hold that 
any one method of instruction, or plan of procedure in school technique, can 
be applied with like favorable results to all children, not even to all normal 
children. A method of instruction in reading, for example, which will be 
effective for the child possessing strong visual imagery, may be of very doubt- 
ful merit when used in instructing a child of the motor type. It isto be hoped 
that the time is not far distant when certain standard tests may be devised to 
determine the sensory and intellectual differences of children, to the end that 
instruction may be modified and adapted to suit individual rather than general 
needs, Not only is the psychology of individual differences important in its 
bearing on the methods of instruction ; it is likewise important in ascertaining 
the interests and capacities of children and adolescents for various kinds of 
school work and for various kinds of occupations in the life outside the school. 
No one course of study can be ideal when considered from this point of 
view. |

find out how the machine is to be manipulated. The 
skilled individual, on the other hand, consciously limiting 
the scope of his inquiry, and thus the field of trial, will 
arrive very much more rapidly and directly at the goal of 
his endeavors. 
An interesting illustration of the workings of the prin- 
ciple of trial and error when under conscious direction 
Trial and 2° !ound in the new science of aviation. The 
error in crude beginnings were made by constructing 
een machines from general mechanical principles 
already known, but accurate knowledge in regard to atmos- 
pheric conditions was soon found to be surprisingly’slight. 
The Wrights and other pioneers in this field worked with 
gliders to ascertain the principles of support, balancing, 
and soaring. These principles could be determined only 
by an actual try-out,and could not be deduced from any 
known laws. When motors were used, it was found that 
there was a marked difference in the behavior of powerfully 
driven machines from that of the slowly moving gliders. 
Under these new conditions it was found necessary to un- 
learn a large part of what had already been learned. ‘‘We 
have flown and flown till we hunted out the reason for 
these things, and found how to modify the machine to pre- 
vent them.” } { 
Frederick Todd? gives an interesting description of the 
atmospheric conditions with which the aviator must ex- 
periment in the actual try-out of experience in flying. At 
the outset he had no generally known laws to guide him. 
Todd says: “Every man with whom I have talked 
who has been up in the air upon any kind of a flying- 
machine says the same thing about the turmoil of the air 
above the surface of the earth. It is incessantly moving, 
yet never moving along steadily. It goes by fits and starts 
and it dearly loves to go into whirls. ... The surface

winds strike against houses, trees, fences, in their flow, and 
bound upward. ... Light aeroplanes feel a difference in 
the upward push of heated air rising from different fields, 
as when passing from a potato field to mown stubble. Five 
hundred to a thousand feet up within the zone of surface 
winds, breezes may be encountered flowing in different 
directions.” 
The swirland buffeting of the air currents result in conden- 
sations and rarefactions of atmosphere that are a constant 
menace. It was a “hole in the air” that sent the ‘expert 
aviator Hoxsey to his death on December 31, 1910, at the 
Los Angeles meet. Under such novel conditions as these 
it will probably be a long time before aviation will have 
passed entirely beyond the stage of trial and error into that 
of finally established scientific principles. This period of 
trial and error will cost much in money and in life. It is, 
however, necessary for ultimate achievement in any new 
field. 
In this discussion it must be remembered that trial and error among 
the lower orders of animal life and in man may mean something so 
essentially different that a confusion is likely to arise if we do not take 
account of this difference. Among zodlogists trial and error signifies 
merely the attempt of the organism to adjust itself to new external 
conditions in such a way as to secure a better adaptation to its environ- 
ment. This in no way implies a conscious try-out on the part of the or- 
ganism concerned. When, however, we have reached a higher stage of 
development, particularly in man, we may assume, as we have already 
pointed out, that trial and error is something more than a mere hit-and 
miss process through which an adjustment is finally secured. The 
trial becomes a conscious one, and is self-directed.1 
1“ The application of the phrase ‘trial and error’ to lower organisms 
arose as follows : These organisms react to changes in the conditions by 
movements of a peculiar character, which subject them to various environ- 
mental changes. Some of these changes cause them to react further, still 
further changing the conditions. Finally, asa rule, their continued movements 
bring them into conditions which do not cause them to react by further 
movements.”’ Quoted from Jennings, ‘ Comparative Psychology,” Amer. Nat, 
October, 1909.

exploration. the field of exploration for the child by laying 
down rules and giving instruction in general principles of 
procedure; by acquainting the child through various 
methods of instruction with a large body of facts, which 
have been laboriously discovered through the experience 
of the race, but which the child cannot find out directly, be- 
cause to do this would preclude all possibilities of advance 
from one generation to the next. Still, it should be re- 
membered that there are certain things the child should be 
allowed and even compelled to find out for himself. The 
so-called inductive method of instruction has a place here, 
but probably a very much more limited place than its ad- 
vocates have supposed. 
There is a prevailing opinion among certain educators that one of | 
the best methods of teaching a lesson in physics, for example, is to re- 
quire the class to go through a large number of details in the collection 
of materials for a physical experiment and in the conduct of.the experi- 
ment itself. Suppose that a seventh grade class is to be given instruc- 
tion in the making and use of the electric battery. The children may be 
required to get together with a great deal of difficulty and pains the 
materials necessary for the construction of the battery, — the glass jar, 
the copper and the zinc, the wire, the acids, and so on; then they are 
told in the class to make the proper connections with the various bat- 
teries so that the current may ring an electric bell. After a great amount of 
trouble, and no little expectation, the wiring is completed, but the bell 
does not ring, and the class ends with the experiment unsuccessful. 
When we are told that this sort of a result is the one to be desired, and that 
the child will be taught by his first failure to see his mistakes and to 
profit by them, we may question the legitimacy of such a conclusion. 
The very fact that the whole procedure has been unsuccessful, and that 
the children have no real knowledge of why it has not succeeded, since 
they have not sufficient acquaintance with the principles of electricity to 
narrow the field of their attention to the essential difficulties with which 
they are confronted, causes a confusion and misunderstanding which is

not likely to be cleared up by theif cia investigations. It is probable 
that eventually the teacher will be obliged to point out to them their 
mistakes and to suggest the proper remedy. It is by no means certain, 
however, that the children will carry away from this experiment a 
sufficiently comprehensive knowledge of the right method and the prin- 
ciples underlying it to compensate for the great loss of time and the 
possible erroneous conceptions which may grow out of their failures. If 
in the first place the teacher had provided the pupils with the materials 
and had directed the children carefully in their manipulation of these 
materials, the initial result would have been successful, and a great sav- 
ing in time would have been achieved. It would then have been possi- 
ble for the class to follow out the method of the teacher with a clear 
understanding of the aims, means, and results. 
To compel the pupil to follow out the roundabout 
method of trial and error in gaining knowledge is to put 
him on the level with the animal, which cannot learn through 
instruction and intelligent imitation, but which can succeed 
only after repeated failures and many trials in arriving at 
a simple and habitual series of reactions. 
The fault of generalization from a large mass of par- 
‘ticulars that cannot be readily mastered and unified is 
again illustrated in some of the methods in the 
teaching of history that have been recom- ere tog 
mended and practiced in the higher grades and methods in J : elementary 
in the first years of the high school course. ana second- 
Among the gravest errors here is the attempt 4ty educa- 7 , ren to bring university methods down to the period ani \ 
of later childhood and early adolescence. Such method 
are continually advocated. 
For example, in the report of the Committee on Methods of Teaching 
and Study of the New England Teachers’ Association, among many excel- 
lent suggestions, we find the following, which for the age in question is 
distinctly unpedagogical :1 “ The raw material should be put before the 
student, he should organize it for himself, take his own point of view, draw 
his own conclusions, formulate his own statements. The teacher appears 
only as a guide and critic.” The Committee of Seven likewise recom- 
mends that the pupil get ideas and facts from various books and put

  26 The Learning Process 
these facts into new form as a mental training. Now, while it seems 
quite possible that such a method of comparison and analysis may have 
a value for older pupils in the high school, it can have no other effect 
than to add confusion to the already confused minds of the younger 
pupils. Akin to this fault is the practice of sending pupils to original 
sources of hiscory on account of a supposed greater attractiveness and 
value of these sources, or because of a desire to train the pupil in 
methods of historical investigation. ‘Collateral reading,” says the re- 
port of the Committee on Methods of the New England History 
Teachers’ Association, “should be done as largely as possible in the 
sources of history, for such reading reveals to the student the inner 
spirit of the age, puts him in sympathy with its people, shows him their 
ideals and their aspirations as well as their achievements.” Equally un- 
pedagogical are those texts, once somewhat in use, that are composed 
largely of quotations from original sources connected by a meager sen- 
tence or paragraph of the author’s compiling. 
The fundamental error lying behind all these methods is 
found in the assumption that the child, with his limited 
viewpoint and slight powers of attention, can gain from a 
large mass of material the results which have been obtained 
by the deductive and inductive methods of mature mind.! 
We have already seen that through curiosity and play, 
nature has provided a means whereby the organism is en-

these instinctive factors, the only education that nature 
affords is an adjustment to an environment, immediate 
and present, an environment that “selects” without real 
choice, and plans without conscious “‘purpose.”? This en- 
vironment works by favoring those variations in an or- 
ganism which are best fitted to enter into harmony with the 
immediate external conditions. Other variations may be 
ideally more worthy or better adapted to a future environ- 
ment, but that is not the test applied. The future suitable

and desirable must always yield to the present necessary. 
In a primitive society the individual possessing the latent 
capacities for a superior intellectual and moral attainment 
might readily be crowded out of existence by competitors 
whose only claim to survival was mere brute force. The 
environment asks no questions concerning the future de- 
sirable. The organism that survives must be efficient in 
the present and the present alone.

adaptation to the future non-existent and ideal: If the test 
of immediate adaptability were brought to bear, the gamin 
would be better educated than the schoolboy. The dog is 
trained by an immediate environment to do a few things 
well, interpreted in terms of that immediate environment. 
The child should be educated to do many things well, inter- 
preted in terms of a future environment. The adjustment 
demanded in the learning process is not an adjustment 
to a brute fact, but to a world of meaning, present, yet re- 
mote, real, but also ideal. It should further be remem- 
bered that perfect adjustment for the human being is no 
longer the criterion of adaptation and survival, as it is in 
all nature below man; for perfect adjustment would mean 
stagnation, and finally intellectual and moral death. Since 
the adjustment demanded in the higher learning processes 
is so largely a future adjustment, educational values must 
have as their final justification an ideal. So the philos- 
ophy of education must first formulate its ideal before it 
can discuss intelligently the problem of adjustment, either 
from a normative or a historical standpoint. 
Would not the Spartans have agreed that education

is adjustment to environment, if you had allowed them | 
to define that environment in terms of their ideal, mil-

Sarists of the true environment was not only physical, but

have found such a definition in harmony with his philosophy, 
but would have told us that we should not confuse a real 
environment with this world of shadows. We should 
rather prepare the youth for association with the world of 
changeless and eternal ideas, for Plato the sole reality. 
The Epicureans, as well, would have found no fault with 
the conception of adaptation, but would have insisted that 
the only environment to be considered is the one giving 
hedonic enjoyment. Likewise the Stoic would have con- 
sented, but would have told us that the environment to 
which we are to conform is our highest self, objectified in 
a world of pure reason. The Neo-Platonist, so badly ad- 
justed to this world that he sought in the Beatific Vision 
to escape it, would have been quite content to subscribe to 
the terminology of adaptation, but he would have under- 
stood by it adjustment to the Ineffable One. And so the 
Christians of the Middle Ages would have agreed, with a 
similar thought, that the true environment is to be found 
in a world beyond. Education in terms of adjustment 
would have meant to the Renaissance, in its revolt from 
medizevalism, adjustment to a present world, not of cold 
facts, but of zsthetic realities; and so on through the list, 
until we come to our own time, with its exaltation of prac- 
tical utilitarianism. Education is always adaptation, but 
zt 7s to an ever changing environment, determined by the 
meaning which the conscious tdea gives to this environment. 
The mistake must not be made of supposing that the 
child can be prepared for this future ideal environment, ex- 
cept through the present environment. Therefore, for- 
mal education, like the unsystematic education that the

ronment to which the child is to be adjusted may be entirely 
incomprehensible to him in his present stage of develop-

is social efficiency, and the child is to be educated toward 
this efficiency. In the last analysis no education can jus- 
tify itself which does not tend to make the child a more 
helpful and better member of society. It by no means 
follows, however, although some educators and theorists 
seem to have made the assumption, that the child himself 
can be made to understand the nature of this aim, and to 
be stimulated by it in his school work. Very often, prob- 
ably generally, the immediate ends that spur the child on 
to his highest endeavors in his school environment, are of 
a different nature. The social efficiency which he compre- 
hends is of a much narrower and less exalted type than 
that which education has as an end. The child who is 
socially efficient from his own standpoint is the one that 
succeeds in his school activities, and in competition among’ 
his fellows in his play and work.! The spirit of competi- 
tion may bring about beneficial results when systemati- 
cally applied to school methods. The old-fashioned 
spelling match, which, doubtless, at one time was carried 
to an excess, had much to commend it for this reason. 
Its judicious use as a school exercise is not without value 
to-day. The matching of one room against another, like- 
wise, has a stimulating effect and tends to arouse — 
maintain interest. 
The mistake has been made of assuming that the

sg dae _ nomic sense of the term. It has already been 
sively pointed out that curiosity and play are impor- 
selfish. tant factors in the education of the child and of 
the brute as well. Curiosity of the intellectual type often 
becomes a motive for the child’s endeavors, just as truly as 
it does for the adult’s. Further than this, the spirit of 
play, when introduced with proper precaution into the 
school exercises, is a stimulus to the child. 
Play gives incidental instruction in a variety of ways when properly 
devised. It is a valuable aid to drill, and by means of different plays 
the form of presentation may be varied, while the essence of that which 
is taught remains the same. This prevents monotony, which is often 
the greatest evil of drill, and which may make the effect of repetition, 
after a short time, negative. 
       1 An example of incidental instruction through play is to be found in “the 
pelling game” in the first primary grade. The teacher writes on slips of 
aper a dozen or more words and arranges them, face upwards, along the 
chalk trough of the blackboard or some other convenient place. One of the 
children is told that he is to find the word 7-s (spelled out by the teacher) 
from the list of words that have been previously written and arranged. Heis 
sent out of the room for a moment while the words are arranged, and then 
comes back to search for the proper word. As he moves about trying to find 
it, the children clap, softly if he is far away from the word, and louder if he is 
near it. When he finds the word, they clap with all their might. He picks it 
up, spells it out, and pronounces it, handing it to the teacher. The game is 
continued with other children, and in this way a number of words are learned 
so that they can be recognized when seen, and also can be spelled out. 
In this connection may be mentioned the classic instance of education 
through play, as portrayed by Dickens in “ Oliver Twist.” 
“There, my dear,” said Fagan. ‘That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it? They 
have gone out for the day.” 
“Have they done work, sir ?” inquired Oliver. 
“Yes,” said the Jew; “that is, unless they should unexpectedly come 
across any when they are out ; and'they won’t neglect it if they do, my dear, 
depend upon it. Make ’em your models, my dear. Make ’em your models,” 
tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words : “ do every- 
thing they bid you, and take their advice in all matters — especially the 
Dodger’s, my dear, He’ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too,

Applications of the General Principles 31 
Play, as the expression of the dramatic instinct, may be made servicé- 
able in the study of literature. The dramatization of “ Hiawatha” and 
similar poems is a case in point. The presentation by the older pupils 
of some of the plays of Shakespeare, or perhaps better, parts of them, 
is always sure to secure interest, and aid in the understanding of these 
plays. Curiosity should be legitimately stimulated whenever possible. 
The school readers should contain stories that have a genuine interest 
' for the child, and which tempt him to read beyond the extent of the 
day’s lesson. In assigning lessons, it is possible for the teacher to 
make suggestions that arouse the curiosity of the child, and call his 
attention to the important aspects of the assignment.

significance. In the last analysis it means that 
there must be some form of self-expression on the part 
of the child if any real learning is to take place. This 
does not, of course, necessarily mean that the child must 
be required to execute with his hands, although various

“Yes, sir,’ said Oliver. 
“See if you can take it out, without my feeling it, as you saw them do 
when we were at play this morning.” 
Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the 
Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other. 
“Is it gone ?” cried the Jew. 
“ Here it is, sir,” said Oliver, showing it in his hand. 
“You’re a clever boy, my dear,” said the playful old gentleman, patting 
Oliver on the head approvingly. “I never sawa sharper lad. Here’sa 
shilling for you. Ifyou go on in this way, you'll be the greatest man of the 
time. And now come here, and I’ll show you how to take the marks out of 
the handkerchiefs,” 
Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play had to 
do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being 
so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and 
was soon deeply involved in his new study. t .

|S 
dubols are chiefly to be emphasized for this reason 
rather than for their practical significance. The 
child should be required to do something in connec- 
tion with all the subjects of the curriculum. For example, 
in literature he should be required to express the classics 
which he studies orally, with understanding and sympathy ; 
in nature study he should collect specimens and care for 
plants and animals. Map drawing and clay moceling are 
interesting and instructive activities which are extremely 
useful in the study of geography. In number work the 
pupil should be given actual problems to solve, and con- 
struction work should be made an essential part of the 
study. There is no aspect of education so abstract that it 
is entirely removed from the possibilities of self-expression. 
It should, however, be remembered that this expression 
should be something which naturally inheres in the subject 
matter, and not something which for pedagogical purposes 
is artificially attached to it. Such artificiality should never 
be encouraged ; in the end it defeats its own purposes.

CHAPTER III 
REFLEX-ACTION, INSTINCT, HABIT 
THE simplest activity of the nervous system is repre- 
sented as due to a stimulus affecting an end organ, travers- 
ing a sensory nerve to a specific brain center phe relation 
or centers, and then transferring itself to a mo- ofcon- 
tor nerve that innervates a muscle and results in einer 
an adjustment. Angell defines a reflex activity @ctivity. 
as one “in which a muscular movement occurs in imme- 
diate response to a sensory stimulation without the in- 
terposition of consciousness.” As Angell points out, 
consciousness may be aroused in connection with this 
reflex activity, but this consciousness does not initiate the 
activity, nor in any way control it.1 The consciousness is 
purely incidental to the activity itself. One of the sim- 
plest examples of reflex activity is found in the pupillary 
reflex. The retina is so constructed that varying intensi- 
ties of light act as a stimulus that increases or decreases the 
size of the pupil. Here we have an entirely unconscious 
adjustment, both in the sense that there is no conscious 
control of the pupil, and also that the individual himself is 
unaware, except by indirect means, that the adjustment is 
taking place. When the child puts his hand out and touches 
the glowing stove, he draws away his hand in a purely re- 
flex manner. In this second case, however, although con- 
sciousness does not control the act of drawing away, the 
child is presumably conscious of the movement that he has 
made. Simple reflex activities of such a character as above 
described do not require the intervention of higher nerve 
centers in their activities.

  34 | The Learning Process 
Beside the simple reflex activities, which are primarily 
executed in the lower nerve centers, there are other activi- 
The nature CS Of a non-voluntary type that function either 
of impulsive at birth or arise later in the life of the organism, 
activities. and which are not due to experience. From the 
simple reflexes may be distinguished the so-called impulsive 
activities, the origin of which is to be found within the body 
and which are not due to external excitation. Changes 
in circulation, digestion, and the like, and modifications 
within the nerve centers themselves may be responsible 
for the expression of these activities. The squirming, cry- 
ing, and kicking of the infant are, in a large measure, the 
expression of activities of this sort. 
The most complicated sort of non-voluntary activities 
are the instinctive. A confusion is made by some authori- 
pelle ties between the simple reflex and the instinc- 
activity dis- tive expressions. The distinction between them 
ae. canis is rather a matter of degree than of kind. In- 
refiexac-  stinctive,activitics, as has already been said, are 
ee: complicated in their nature. The.simple reflex 
activity involves relatively few paths of stimulation and dis- 
charge. The instinctive activities, on the other hand, may in- 
- volve many coérdinated and interrelated paths, issuing finally 
in some purposive reaction. Simple reflex activity is often 
“unaccompanied by consciousness, while on the other hand 
the instinctive activities may have a large conscious ac- 
companiment, which is necessary/not for the expression of 
the instinct itself, but for the direction of various details in 
the complex process. For example, the nest-building ac 
tivity of the bird is purely instinctive, and is in no way the 
result of previous learning; yet the visual and other expe- 
riences which arise in the actual building of the nest are 
necessary in the details of its construction. The general 
direction of the activity is, nevertheless, entirely independ- 
ent of these experiences. In the nest-building activity is 
found also a third distinction that exists between the 
-—-—

Reflex-A ction, Instinct, Habit 35 ; - ee 
simple reflexes and instinct, namely, that in the latter - 
there is a degree of emotion, while in the former the affec- 
tive, or feeling element, is for the most part absent. Any 
instinctive activity may then be defined as a group of reflexes ) 
organized toward some definite goal and accompanied in their ? 
expression by a conscious correlate of more or less clearness, 
_and attended by an affective tone of Sreater or less intensity,/ 
‘Where the simple reflexes and impulsive activities leave 
off‘and the more complicated instincts begin, it is difficult . 
to say. No two writers would probably agree upon any 
definite line of demarcation between simple reflex activity 
and instinct. Indeed, as has already been pointed out, 
some give the name of instinct to practically all non- 
voluntary activities furnished to the organism through 
inheritance. 
While it has not been possible to determine with more 
than relative accuracy the instinctive tendencies and in- 
terests of human beings, certain general facts cokers : A list of the of significance to education seem reasonably most impor- 
well established. The most important instincts tant human instincts. 
from the standpoint of the learning process, 
some of which have been discussed in another connection, 
are the following: — 
‘ Fear, anger, sympathy, affection, play, imitation, curios- 
fty, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, self-assertion (leader- 
/ ship), self-abasement, rivalry, envy, jealousy, pugnacity, 
clannishness, the hunting and predatory instincts, the mi- 
gratory instinct, love of adventure and the unknown, 
superstition, the sex instincts, which express themselves 
in sex-love, vanity, coquetry, modesty, and, closely allied 
with these, the love of nature and of solitude, and the 
__ xesthetic, the religious, and the moral emotions. 
The above list does not pretend to present all of the 
human instincts that have been cited at various times in 
the literature on the subject. Nevertheless, it is fairly com- 
prehensive. A more difficult problem than the enumera-
-P-A-G-E-60
  36 The Learning Process 
tion of important instincts is raised in connection with 
their classification. The foregoing enumeration has pre- 
Aielteend: sented the various instincts somewhat in their 
tion of the genetic order, z.e. in the order of their develop- 
ganged ment in the life of the child and adolescent. 
genetic There is a general agreement that fear is among 
standpoint. ‘the earliest instincts to appear, both in the 
child and in the race. Anger, and rage likewise, show 
themselves at an early period of development, while 
sympathy and affection appear somewhat later. The 
play instinct in its most primitive form, together with 
imitation and curiosity, are fundamental instincts. The 
more distinctly social instincts follow in time these earlier 
tendencies. The séx instinct, both in its direct and in- 
direct forms of manifestation, does not appear in its com- 
plete expression until the onset of puberty. 
Another classification of instincts divides them into 
egoistic, altruistic, and mixed forms. Fear, anger, self- 
Bivielieezid assertion, rivalry, envy, pugnacity, and the like 
altruistic Clearly center themselves in the individual that 
instincts. gives expression to them; while sympathy, 
affection, and the higher moral emotions belong to the 
class of altruistic tendencies that have regard for others. 
Of the other instincts, several at least have both egoistic 
and altruistic aspects. This is true, for example, of sex- 
love, and even of the religious instincts. 
Still a third classification of instincts groups them as 
personal and impersonal. The personal instincts center 
around human beings, and, through a natural Personal : : ‘ ‘ 
anit tin. extension, animals as théiryobjects, while the 
personal impersonal instincts expr themselves in instincts. < e e . 
relation to inanimate objects. 
latter may be mentioned the love for natur 
and the appreciation of artistic products. 
A few of the instincts discussed above do not easily fit | 
into any of the foregoing classifications. They have been      
      
   
  
-P-A-G-E-61
  Reflex-Action, Instinct, Habit- 37 
termed the adaptive instincts. They include play, imita- 
tion, curiosity, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, and are 
the most important of all the instincts from the Th e adap- 
standpoint of the learning process, since, as we tiyein- 
have already seen in the case of play, their S™°* 
peculiar function is to adapt the organism to its environ- 
ment in advance of its actual needs. 
In this connection the thoroughgoing classification of Kirkpatrick! 
may be mentioned. He gives the following : — 
(1) Individualistic or self-preservative, expressed in securing food, 
avoiding danger, and in fighting enemies and rivals. (2) Parental or 
racial instincts, expressed in sexual reproduction and the care of the 
young. (3) Socialinstincts, expressed in codperation among the various 
members of the group. (4) Instincts in the higher animals and in man 
that are correlated with these principal groups, including the adaptive 
instincts (play, imitation, and curiosity) and many specialized instincts 
such as the constructive and collecting instincts; the esthetic instinct ;— 
leadership, teasing and jealousy ; the expressive instinct, a special form 
of the social instinct that leads animals to make sounds indicating their 
own bodily or mental states, “and further results in man in the creation 
of art and literature, and the regulative instinct that manifests itself in 
its highest forms in moral and religious behavior.” 
Not all reflex and instinctive activities with which the 
organism is equipped through its inheritance are functional 
at birth. Some appear at certain periods during «aia 
the development of the individual. Oneofthese, appearance 
at least, the sexual instinct, shows relatively ° ™St¢t 
slight evidence of its existence until puberty, and many 
others are delayed forsometime. The infant, for example, 
during the first weeks of its life generally shows no evidence 
of fear. Yet without any reason, as far as the environment 
is concerned, he develops what sometimes amounts to a 
state of terror in the presence of strangers. There are 
many other examples of fears that, as Hall? believes, are

fact that they do not fit present conditions, but do fit a past environment so well, 
is the basis of some of the strongest arguments for psychogenesis.” ‘ Adolex

  38 The Learning Process 
due to racial experience, and not to any learning on the 
part of the individual, which appear at various stages in 
the life history of the child. Curiosity, imitation, and play 
are instinctive activities which are not present at birth, and 
a large number of other similar expressions make their 
appearance from time to time without any definite reason 
as far as the experience of the individual is concerned. 
In connection with the principle of the gradual appear- 
ance of instincts must be mentioned another fact which is 
ere of great educational importance, namely, that 
must be instincts, when they appear, if they are not given 
a the proper environment for their expression, 
through may pass away without ever becoming established 
expressiox- as habits in the life of the organism. As has 
often been pointed out, the instinct for following a moving 
object develops in the chick at a certain time after its emer- 
gence from the shell. If the chick, however, is kept in: 
confinement, and does not have the stimulus of the mother 
hen, or some other object to call this instinct into play, the 
tendency to follow will gradually die out, and later on it 
cannot be taught to the chick. 
In the third place it should be borne in mind, that reflex 
and instinctive activities, while they are directed toward 
Variability Certain ends, are more or less variable in their 
of instinct. application. For example, the chick, a short 
time after emerging from the shell, will perform the 
definite codrdination of pecking at a grain placed on a 
piece of white paper. Here there is an activity due to the 
light stimulus from the object falling upon the retina of 
the chick, with the transmission of the stimulus to the higher 
sensory centers and its subsequent transference to the motor 
nerves, which transference results in the proper muscular 
adjustment. However, the chick soon learns through experi- 
ence to distinguish between those particles which are pleasant 
cence,” II, p.371. See also“ A Study of Fears,” Amer. Jour. of Psychol., VIII, 
PP- 147-249 (1897).

  Reflex-Action, Instinct, Habit 39 
and suitable for foodand those which aredisagreeable. Thus 
the instinct, which formerly was general, has been so mod- 
ified as to be applied only to certain kinds of objects 
which the chick sees. Ina similar way the human infant, 
after the first few months of its stan has a ten- 
dency to pick up and put into its mouth any object that 
comes conveniently at hand. Through its experiences, 
however, it after a time learns the difference between 
candy and a quinine tablet, and modifies its instinctive 
reaction accordingly. | 
In the fourth place, instinctive and reflex activities can 
be modified, and, perhaps, if not too fundamental, entirely 
eliminated, by bringing them into competition 
with other activities of a similar nature. For ete 
example, the instinctive activity of the child to elimination ‘ go aa of instincts. 
fondle animals may be completely inhibited by =~ 
a scratch from a frightened cat or the bite of an angry 
dog. As acorollary to this statement, it should be borne 
in mind that no instinctive or reflex activity can be 
created de_novo. Further it must be remembered that 
many instincts cannot be entirely eliminated, and that all 
that can be done is to direct them in the way in which 
they should discharge. 
As we have already said in, the discussion of the circu- 
lar-activity theory of Baldwin, pleasure heightens the vital 
tone of the organism and increases its activity, eladis 
while pain, lowering the vital tone, has the pain in rela- 
: ee : tion to the opposite effect. Pleasure in itself is always ooo. 
immediately beneficial to the organism; the un- ofan ~ 
pleasant, always harmful. Under the direction “#*™°™ 
of these two opposing experiences the activities of the 
organism are furthered or hindered, as the case may be. 
The child who, seeing the stick of candy, reaches out and 
gets it and puts it in his mouth, has thereby the reaching 
and the sucking instincts more fully confirmed. On’ the 
other hand, the chick, pecking at a bad-tasting worm,  
-P-A-G-E-64
  40 The Learning Process 
learns through the guidance of the disagreeable experi- 
ence to refrain from pecking that sort of an object again. 
The many diffuse movements with which the organism is 
provided are selected and preserved or discarded in pro- 
portion as they result in pleasurable experiences or their 
opposite. It is, then, through this underlying principle of » 
pleasure and pain that the development of the organism’s 
adjustments to its environment progresses. 
The mistake should not be made, however, of supposing 
that pleasure and pain are the end toward which the 
Pleasure  2djustments are made. These adjustments oc- 
not the cur not to secure satisfaction, but satisfaction conscious ° . ° e 
éndiot arises when the adjustments are satisfactorily 
activity. made, while dissatisfaction indicates a malad- 
justment. This law may be made more definite by a 
concrete illustration. The infant who sees the red ball 
suspended in front of its chair, and who reaches out 
and grasps the ball, does not execute this activity because 
of a desire to obtain pleasure. The activity is of a spon- 
taneous or instinctive character, and the pleasure issues 
simply because the end of the activity has.been grati- 
fied. The principle involved may be expressed by the 
statement that pleasure is not the conscious end of activity, 
but is the necessary accompaniment of all activities that 
result in adequate adjustment. 
Habit can be explained, like instinctive and reflex activi- 
ties, in terms of the neural basis on which all habits are 
The neural SUPPosed to rest. James pictures habit as being 
basis of set up through paths of least resistance, formed 
re in the nervous system by repeated stimulation 
and response in certain definite directions. We may look 
upon the nervous system in its early stages of develop- 
ment in the race and in the individual as being Telatively 
undifferentiated, although the coérdinations already dis- 
cussed that exist at birth must: be regarded as based upon 
certain most permeable tracks in the nervous organism.
-P-A-G-E-65
  Reflex-Action, Instinct, Habit ; 4I 
The explanation for the diffuse movements already dis- 
cussed is to be found.in the circumstance that the stimu- 
lation which reaches the higher centers finds at ad : ; : Comparison 
first no direct and simple path of discharge, and, between 
therefore, spreads out in various directions; but sae ps0 
after a time, since it happens that discharge in voluntary 
certain of these directions results in more suit- *%™4* 
able reactions than in others, the discharge in these direc- 
tions is furthered, until at length the stimulus finds only 
one path for its outlet. Gradually as the nervous system 
develops in perfection, paths of preferred conduction be- 
come more numerous. Those which arise through inher- 
itance are of the reflex and instinctive type. Those that 
‘are due to experience are habits. A habit may then be 
defined from the neurological point of view as a path of pre- 
ferred conduction between stimulus and response set up by an 
due to thé life experiences of the organism. The great dif- 
ference, then, between habits and the activities previously 
~ discussed is in the manner of their acquisition. They 
resemble each other in that they probably have a similar 
neural basis, and that they are definitely codrdinated and 
take place without conscious control. Habits, of course, 
cannot be present at birth. Some instincts are, but, as has 
been said, a large number of them appear later in life. 
The fundamental difference between habit and instinct lies 
in the fact that the former is due to the organism’s experi- 
ence, while the-latter arises independent of such experience. 
Flabit ts the result of the learning process, while tnstinct 
and reflex activity are elements which lie at the basis of 
learning. 
Experimental psychology has, during the last twenty 
years, given no little attention to the question of 
habit formation. Among earlier investigations may be 
mentioned those of Bryan and Harter! and of Bour- 
1 « Studiestin the Physiology and Psychology of the Telegraphic Language,” 
The Psychol, Rev., IV, pp. 27-53 (1897).

  42 The Learning Process 
don.1. Among more recent investigations may be men: 
tioned the various studies of Swift,? that of Book? on the 
Experi- acquisition of skill in typewriting, and a study 
mental in learning to solve complicated puzzles by 
ate Ruger. Thereis substantial agreement in these 
the forma- investigations on some of the most important 
tion of habit. ° P 
aspects of habit formation. 
The general conclusion td be deduced from these ex- 
periments is that rapid improvement in learning a skillful 
act is made at first. This is the time of the _Improve- | ‘ . 
ment in formation of the more simple adjustments, and learning . . . . 
relatively it is also the period when the work is under- 
— at taken with a zest, because of its novel character. 
fir As the adjustments increase in complexity, and 
as the initial interest disappears, the progress becomes less 
marked and the learning curve shows fluctuations, with 
falls when there are relapses into less skillful methods of 
work. There are also long periods of no improvement. 
However, the ability to improve seems to have no fixed 
limits. Very few habits are so perfectly formed that 
further practice may not increase the efficiency with which 
they are executed. 
Bryan and Harter, in their pioneer study, pointed out 
the fact that in learning the art of telegraphy there were 
Signifi- periods of a considerable extent during which no 
cance of progress was made. To these they gave the 
“ plateaus.” name of “plateaus,” a term that has been ac-

2“ Mind in the Making,” New York, 1908. This brings together the re- 
sults of investigations previously appearing in other publications. A chapter 
is devoted to the statement of the manner in which certain habits connected 
with learning acts of skill are formed. The habits investigated by Swift were 
ball-tossing, typewriting, and the like.

cepted by subsequent investigators. While the existence 
of these plateaus has been conclusively proved, their cause 
and general significance is somewhat a matter of dispute. 
Bryan and Harter explained them as arising when a lower 
order of habits (habits more elementary and less complex 
in nature)-““are approaching their maximum development, 
but are not as yet sufficiently automatic to leave the atten- 
tion free to attack the higher-order habits.” Therefore 
these plateaus are necessary stages, from this point of view, 
‘Mefisition of skill. Later investigators, particularly 
Book, take issue with this interpretation. It has been 
pointed out that no one order of habits is entirely perfected 
-before habits of a more complex order make their appear- 
ance. Indeed, Swift holds that all factors in a complex 
group of habits are present to a degree from the start. 
Book believes that the plateaus are due to lengthy periods 
of “lapses in attention, relaxations of interest and effort.” 
They are “ critical stages ” in the learning, and the rapidity 
with which they are transcended is important. They are 
often accompanied by the attempt on the part of the learner 
to make up through the application of voluntary attention 
and by the use of excessive effort, the loss of the earlier 
interest that accompanied the learning. This sometimes 
leads to a relapse into more elementary and less valuable 
methods of procedure, with the result that there is an ac- 
tual breaking down in the learning and a retrogression in 
general facility. Therefore these stages of arrest in learning 
should be avoided tf possible, and never extended over a 
longer period than ts actually necessary. 
Improvement in habit formations is not due simply nor _ ye ee 
largely to the making of habits already acquired more 
facile and automatic. Advance is achieved by ° . The ap- making “cross-cuts,’ by reducing roundabout sciaanal 
methods to more direct—means of getting the aleve ety

helpful variations in method seem to appear by chance, and 
may remain for some time unknown tothelearner. Ruger, 
however, emphasizes the importance of getting them into 
attentive consciousness as soon as they appear, in order 
that they may be utilized to their greatest extent. He 
points out the danger and the waste in time of leaving 
their perfection to mere chance. 
A number of factors that impede or facilitate learning, 
some subjective and others objective, have been pointed 
iiss out by the various investigators who have un- jective . 
and subjec- dertaken the analysis of habit formation. The 
ye “cine relative difficulty of the work is one of the most 
oraid § evident of the objective conditions. However, 
learning. —_ when the material remains practically the same 
during the course of the learning, there still appear ‘“‘ good 
work days” and “bad work days.” Among other objec- 
tive conditions, certain physiological rhythms are important. 
There are times when the learner feels “ fit,” while on 
other occasions he lacks something in his bodily tone, and 
this is accompanied by an inability to give concentrated 
attention, and is manifested on the mechanical side by a 
general slowing down of the speed of performance and an 
increase in errors. The subjective factors, which have 
been revealed by detailed introspection, are found to play 
an important part in the efficiency of the work from day to 
day and in the rapidity with which the habits are acquired. 
A favorable attitude toward the work seems absolutely neces- 
sary for the highest effictency. A feeling of confidence is 
also essential, while discouragement precludes the possibil- 
ity of improvement. Whenthe learner distrusts his ability 
and is anxious about the results of his accomplishment, he 
is apt “to go to pieces.” Success generally acts as a 
stimulus for continued satisfactory performance. “Book 
has outlined the general course of the feelings during a 
complex and extended experiment in the acquisition of 
skill. In the beginning all the learners show considerable

interest in the work; continued practice, however, results 
in the loss of spontaneous interest, and a general feeling of 
monotony, often amounting to disgust, tends to arise, but 
as greater skill is acquired, a permanent interest appears. 
“When an expert skill was attained, a habit had been 
formed of keeping attention so constantly applied to the 
task in hand that nothing could distract it.” 
In addition to these distinctly “ feeling” attitudes, Ruger 
has pointed out the importance of the proper intellectual 
attitude in learning. The learner succeeds best ,,

Such a person does not trust to chance in the ‘°47™™2& 
formation of his associations. He analyzes, generalizes, 
classifies and eliminates under the direction of focal con- 
sciousness. He is critical of his own methods, and is al- 
ways ready to change old methods when better ones offer 
themselves. 
Among other facts of importance that have been deduced fromthe above 
cited experiments may be mentioned the following: (1) After an inter- 
val of rest in learning, Book found that on the resumption of practice 
there appeared to be an actual gain over the best previous performance. 
This somewhat surprising result has been noticed by previous investi- 
gators, particularly Bourdon and Swift, and has been amply confirmed 
by a series of experiments at the University of Illinois that have not as yet 
been reported. Book attributes this result to the dropping out of the 
partly-formed bad habits during the interval of rest. (2) The value of 
putting forth a maximal effort to gain a permanent improvement has 
been emphasized, particularly by Bryan and Harter, who say: “One 
conclusion seems to stand out from all these facts more clearly than any- 
thing else, namely, that in learning to interpret the telegraphic language, 
it ts the intense effort that educates.” Swift, while agreeing with this 
conclusion in general, adds the caution that spurts cannot be relied on 
to accomplish this result. The effort must be sustained, and not spo- 
radicand haphazard. (3) Book emphazises the fact that a balance must 
be preserved between accuracy and speed. The imperfectly formed 
habits must be mastered before substantial progress can be made. They

  46 | The Learning Process 
should be acquired as rapidly as possible, but not so rapidly that speed — 
. shall be gained at the expense of accuracy. “The desire to hurry on | 
must be nicely balanced with due caution.” 
In the discussion of the previous pages and in that which 
is to follow, the point of view, either expressed or implicitly 
pithy assumed, is that habits when fully set up proceed 
ness ap- without conscious direction. The individual 
ee oy starts his life with a few perfected codrdinations. 
need forit In learning others, consciousness is functional 
mag up to the point where new adjustments which 
adapt the organism to its environment are perfectly formed. 
Then it is that consciousness as a directive influence re- 
cedes, and the organism adjusts itself with automatic pre- 
cision and regularity. The biological view asserts that con- 
sciousness arises both in the race and in the individual only 
when there is necessity for it; that, in other words, it ap- 
pears when there is only a partial or imperfect adjustment 
toa situation. Jf the adjustment ts adequate, then there ts 
no further need of conscious direction, hence consciousness 
tends to disappear. 
This point of view seems simple and entirely consistent, 
until we consider that the term “habit” is used to mean not 
Habits of Only habits of adjustment, but also habits of 
thought thought and feeling. We can think, for example, 
and feeling. of 4 train of ideas as having an habitual connec- 
tion; we speak of a habit of thinking clearly or loosely ; 
we recognize emotional habits in our friends and acquaint- 
ances. Now in these latter cases we have conscious ele- 
ments that are united in what may clearly be considered 
habitual ways, and it, therefore, seems as if our statement 
that habit functions below the level of consciousness were 
open to serious objections. These objections, if carefully 
considered, are, however, more apparent than real. In 
the first place, it must be kept in mind that the point of 
view above urged has not maintained that habits are un- 
accompanied by consciousness, but only that a perfectly
-P-A-G-E-71
Reflex-Action, Instinct, Habit 47 
developed habit does not require consciousness for its ex- 
pression. For example, the perfected act of walking may 
be regarded as a habit set up on an instinctive basis. 
The fact that it is accomplished with accuracy and with 
rapidity is due to the unconscious manner in which the 
function is performed. However, there are various stimuli, 
such as the pressure on the soles of the feet, that are neces- 
sary for the habit to be carried out with nicety. These 
stimuli may arise clearly above the threshold of conscious- 
ness, and further the muscular adjustments necessary in 
the habit. They also mediate sensations more or less 
dimly recognized. 
How essential these sensations are in the accurate carrying out of the 
habit may be shown in pathological cases. In the disease known as 
tabes dorsalis, one of the most striking symptoms consists in the peculiar 
manner in which the patient raises his feet awkwardly and uncertainly 
in his clumsy walking. The reason for this is not because of paralysis, 
but because of an insensitivity in the soles of the feet, which prevents 
the adequate stimulus on which the act of walking depends from being 
fully operative. Again, if through disease the sensations arising from 
the contraction of the muscles and tendons and the rubbings of the 
joints were deadened or entirely destroyed, the habit of walking would 
be greatly interfered with, if not made impossible. These illustrations 
go to show that a certain amount of consciousness may be necessary in 
the perfect carrying out of our most habitual processes. 
In the thought processes we have a similar state of affairs, even when 
they move along in an entirely habitual manner. 
Under such circumstances the direction of the thought 
may be determined by a consciously controlled end or pur- 
pose; the stimuli necessary to arouse it and the ype method 
resulting thought product may be entirely within of thought 
the realm of consciousness, although the methods sata 
by which the thought attains its end are entirely chanical. 
mechanical. Take, for example,-the state of consciousness 
that arises in the mind of the adult when he hears three 
times eight spoken. He arrives at the result twenty-four 
in a perfectly habitual way. The fact that he is conscious 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
  48 The Learning Process 
of the spoken words and of the result arrived at does not 
imply conscious direction. The condition is similar to that 
of the expert piano player who is conscious of the instru- 
ment before him and the harmony he is producing, but 
not of the details of the technique of the piano playing. 
Further, it should be remembered that habits, whether 
merely physiological or intellectual, are generally in various 
Hebi m,. . 8t28¢S of completion, and never so adequately 
various perfected that their course may not be broken 
tits in upon. In such cases consciousness to a 
require con- greater or less degree must be present, in order 
serowsne®®* to control those parts of the activity that are 
not at the time perfectly habituated. 
We must also consider the fact that in our highest in- 
tellectual processes, where thought controls a very large

peg varying degrees habitual aspects to our highest 
like. conscious activity. To think accurately, we 
must attend, and attending in many of its essential features 
is a matter of habit. 
It should also be borne in mind that what we sometimes 
call a single habit is really a group of habitual and instinc-

control. In the rational process, as in the habitual re- 
sponses, we have a similar state of affairs, certain parts of 
this process that have been fully set up and formulated 
following entirely mechanical laws without the intervention 
of consciousness. They form the habitual phases of the 
thought process. On the other hand, where the neces- 
sity of codrdination and grouping arises, there we find 
elements of conscious control,
-P-A-G-E-73
Reflex-Action, Instinct, Habit 4G 
Again, in our thought processes we often react to ideal 
rather than concrete situations. It is this ideal that con- . 
trols the conduct. If the ideal is one that has ygeats ang 
been established as a habitual mode of thought, habits in ’ ‘ ° : . the control

consciousness as a controlling principle. On Processes. 
the other hand, if it does not come as something old, it is 
kept in consciousness with more or less effort, and the 
thought process then proceeds for a large part on a non- 
habitual level. For these various reasons, then, it seems 
probable that wherever there is a fully set-up conscious 
activity directing an adjustment, there is a maximum of 
voluntary activity and a minimum of habit. It is relatively 
certain, on the other hand, that if our lives could be entirely 
reduced to habit, the existence of clear consciousness, 
perhaps of any consciousness at all, would be unnecessary. 
Indeed, an habitual activity may be interrupted by 
thinking about its expression and attempting to control it. 
One of the most important questions which arises in 
connection with habit formation, and one which, as we 
shall see in a later discussion, has a pronounced 4 jg ¢on- 
educational significance, is the possibility of tended that 
the formation of a generalized habit. It is a 
denied by many writers that such a thirig as a Seneralized. 
_ generalized habit is possible. As Bagley’ puts it, “a 
simple habit is a specific response to a specific stimulus; 
a generalized habit would be a specific response to a num- 
ber of different stimuli.” There seems to be no reason in 
the nature of the case, as far as the mechanism of the 
nervous system is concerned, however, why we may not 
think of several stimuli resulting in a particular response 
along a definite path of conduction, or why, on the other 
hand, we may not conceive of a’ single stimulus forming 
several passages of discharge. Passing by this’ rather 
problematical consideration, we may consider severe senses

in which we are warranted in assuming practically the 
existence of a generalized habit. Such an expression 
seems to be admissible under the following conditions.

For example, the soldier who has learned to come to attention at the 
word of command will do so on the parade ground or the street. It, 
of course, may be said that for the soldier who so responds the actual 
situation is the same under these varying conditions. However, this is 
true only as far as the dominant element in the situation remains sim- 
ilar, this dominant element being determined not by its objective im- 
portance to the general observer, but by the fact that the soldier does 
thus react under various circumstances. For the ordinary observer, 
however, this dominant element may be of but slight importance, and 
thus in his relations with his fellow men, the soldier may appear to have 
acquired a generalized habit. ; 
(6) There is another class of habitual reactions which do 
not seem to be called forth by any definite objective stimulus, 
‘Asa specific Dut which appear under a large variety of objec-

ofamood. when the reactionis under the dominance of a 
mood or emotion that so colors the objective environment

sponse. A person, for example, of a choleric disposition 
may have established a very definite set of reactions which 
habitually express his angry moods. The insignificant ex- 
ternal causes that set off these definite responses may vary 
greatly, and it may thus be urged that not one stimulus, 
but many stimuli, are involved in producing the reaction. 
In the case of morbid pity, irrational fear, religious enthu- 
siasm, and the like, the object which arouses these moods 
is apparently indifferent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75

(c) We may also have in any definite reaction to a given 
situation not merely one elementary adjustment, but many 
adjustments both positive and negative. Letus , 9 
suppose that a child in the schoolroom is being plex set of 
taught to correctly form the letter A in his copy- cereal 
book. Here we have the example of training in various 
in a special habit, in which we have a definite **¥#4"* 
stimulus of sight, namely, the letter A of the copybook. 
This letter constitutes the essential stimulus to which there 
is a specific response, the,writing of the letter A. This 
response gradually becomes more and more an habitual 
process, and we have set up a definite habit of stimulus and 
response. However, beside this specific stimulus of the 
written or. printed A of the copybook, there are other 
stimuli which constitute the total situation, which stimuli 
might function equally well for copying B or any other 
letter. We have momentarily the specific A-copying re- 
action, but we have as well a more general reaction based . 
on the seeing of the copybook, the “feel” of the pen, 
etc., which may be termed the “copybook ” reaction; be- 
yond this we have a still more general group of motor ex- 
pressions and inhibitions which constitute the “school” 
reaction, as such, and differentiate it from the “ home”’ re- 
action, forexample. Now in the copying of the letter A 
all these various reactions are involved, but only a very 
small part of the total reaction functions solely for the A- 
copying habit; much of it might function equally well for 
the reading habit, or. the number-work habit. There is,. 
then, a considerable part of the A- -copying habit that is not 
specific in the sense that it is confined to the one particular of 
copying the A. Itis general in the sense that it concerns 
itself with many other school activities. For example, the 
ignoring of the noises on the street, the holding of the 
body in the proper position at the desk, etc., are reactions 
concerned with the business of copying the A.}

circle of habit, loses the possibility of reaction on a higher 
level and, therefore, the possibility of further education. 
It might be inferred from the general nature of the evolu- 
tionary process and the demands of adjustment, that the 
organisms that have acquired a large stock of habits are 
for that reason the best equipped for survival, since they 
are more perfectly adapted to their environment than are 
those organisms which have not acquired such habits. In 
a sense this is a true statement of the case, but it applies 
only to those animals whose possibilities of education are 
limited to a definite number of reactions in a relatively 
simple environment.

tions do not mean that the individual should not acquire a 
large number of habits, but they do mean that also there 
should be beyond the sphere of habitual activity an unlim- 
ited place for the further development of habits. Zhe 
difference between the person who continues to make progress 
all through his life, and the one whose real life is ended in 
his early manhood ts that the former always possesses an 
open mind and the attitude of finding in his environment 
further possibilities of adjustment. It has sometimes been 
said that most school teachers end their effective period 
of usefulness in the early years of their professional 
careers. If this were true, it would be because they orig- 
inally approached their profession with mind open, and 
because they found in their school environment new situ- 
ations to. be solved. Those who after a brief period of 
teaching have become dead are those who have been satis- 
fied in limiting their activities to the things which they 
have learned in the first years of their professional work. 
The environment presented by the school may be regarded 
as a relatively simple one that can be readily compre- 
hended, and the reactions to which can easily be mechan- 
ized, or it may be regarded as perhaps the most complex 
of all environments, in which the possibilities of new ad- 
justments are practically limitless. It is the teacher who 
regards the school in this latter way who never ceases to 
grow. 
It may easily be seen from the foregoing that the envi- 
ronment to which the intelligent human being is to react is 
one whose complexity is determined very largely pre puman 
by the attitude which the individual brings to environ- : ° ment infi- 
that environment, and not by the environment nitely 
as objectively considered. If the environment complex. 
‘were merely objective and contained a certain definite 
number of parts or elements to which the organism was 
to adjust itself, why, then, it would clearly follow that the 
organism best adjusted was that organism which had

mechanized the largest number of possible reactions. But 
since the environment is constructed in a large measure 
eby the individual's attitude toward it, the number of possi- 
ble reactions can never be determined. In other words, 
the environment, while not infinitely extended, is infinitely 
extensible. vr 
It has been for a long time the prevailing opinion that,

able that the plasticity of the nervous system is greater 
than has been supposed. There seems to be no period in 
the life of the individual, before senescence, where a defi- 
nite limit can be sét to his ability to acquire new habits or 
to his power to break off old ones. There is doubtless 
great individual variation in plasticity, and, therefore, in 
the tendency to acquire habits.

CHAPTER IV 
THE EDUCABILITY OF INSTINCTS AND HABITS 
THE most fundamental instincts cannot be entirely elimi- 
nated. Since they represent those impulses which have 
been tried out through countless years of racial phe funda- 
experience, they are too closely interwoven with mental 
the life of the individual to be set aside. When cannot be 
entirely checked in their expression, they subject *liminated. 
both the individual and society to the gravest of dangers. 
If the social organism becomes so complex that these in- 
stincts find no natural outlet, society itself must either 
change its form or perish. 
However, it does not follow from the above that-it is im- 
possible to educate and to modify instincts.1_ No instinct 
can express itself except under environmental owever, 
conditions more or less adapted to that expres- instincts 
sion. As has already been pointed out, instincts, Sri ot and 
when they appear, if they do not have the proper ™odified. 
environment for their expression, may, if not too funda- 
mental, pass away without ever having become established 
as habits. The obvious educational application here is 
that the greatest care should be taken, both by parents 
and teachers, to see to it that undesirable instincts find no 
soil in which they may take root. This would be true, for 
example, of certain instinctive fears, if perchance they ex- 
ist, such as the fear of the dark. It is, however, to be 
1The philosopher Schopenhauer maintained that these instinctive im- 
pulses, which he identified with will, could not be educated, and that the 
only way to rid the world of an evil will was to destroy it. He, however, did 
not take into consideration the fact that the direction of the expression of this 
will can be modified through environmental conditions, 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 The Learning Process 
doubted if there are many instincts which z# foto are un- 
. desirable, and the problem which education has before it 
is not to any great extent the elimination of instinct, but 
the turning of instinct into proper channels. 
Here the rule must be laid down that if a certain form 
of instinctive expression is considered undesirable, it is ab- 
Substitu.  Solutely essential that the educator and the so- 
tion, not cial reformer find some new avenue for the 
a expression of the instinct that shall be desir- 
directing able. Mere prohibition must always fail, if the 
ee prohibition aims at some fundamental and deep- 
seated tendency in the life of the child or of the adult. 
The boy who has the impulse within him to go out beyond 
his narrow environment, and in search for adventure, per- 
haps to run away from home, is expressing, in a way, a 
primitive instinct of the human race; one which has led the 
explorer in his painful march to the frontier, and has es- 
tablished civilization in the remotest ends of the earth; an 
instinct of inestimable value to the human race, but in the 
particular form of its expression dangerous to the boy. 
The parent and the teacher can certainly not eradicate this 
instinct by simply prohibiting it; they can, however, pro- 
vide the boy with stories of adventure, or encourage him 
to write such stories himself in his composition work in 
the school. If in fear of this instinct the child is carefully 
guarded from literature of this sort in the school and the 
home, the result may be the loss of the taste for all such 
literature ; or this repression may lead to the breaking 
forth of the instinct in a more violent form. 
The migratory instinct which expresses itself in the love for adven- 
ture and in the discovery of the unknown, may find a legitimate satis- 
faction in the form of the school excursion, in explorations in local 
geography, in the gathering of geological specimens and the like. The 
sex instinct, which at first appears strongly during the adolescent years, 
may find safe expression in properly supervised social gatherings. 
These the schools should encourage to a reasonable extent and with 
necessary limitations.
-P-A-G-E-81
  The Educability of Instincts and Habits 57 
The tremendous significance of the play instinct in the 
learning process has already been touched upon in the pre- 
ceding pages. It may be added here that in 
the modification and control of other instincts it anaes aa 
serves an important office, since through play te _ 
the experience of the child may be in imagina- 
tion extended to those objects which are the ends of other 
instincts. In play the boy may safely satisfy his instinct 
for adventure, his hunting and predatory tendencies, his 
desire for combat and the like. 
In the first school years play interests occupy a large part of the 
child’s attention. The earliest plays are of the romping variety, full of 
movement and strikingly like those of animals in their aimless abandon. 
These plays are largely atavistic in their character, and are suggestive of 
Hall’s theory of the origin of play. In their more organized forms these 
plays appear in the hunting and fighting impulses of boys, and in the 
tendency of boys to form gangs and secret clubs of various sorts. The 
organized plays of girls are more-imitative, generally speaking, though 
they have an evident basis in the maternal instincts. Girls play dolls 
and house; boys build forts and play at soldiers and Indians. The 
later plays are less instinctive in their nature, and their forms are pri- 
marily due to the suggestion of the environment. Here belong numerous 
games, some of them centuries old and but slightly changed in the 
course of the ages, such is the wonderful conservatism of childhood.’ In 
definitely planning plays for educational purposes, we should strive to 
select those forms of play activity that are spontaneous with children. 
One of the most serious criticisms that has been brought against the 
plays of the kindergarten is that children do not play these when they 
are by themselves. It should further be remembered that too much 
supervision in play may be undesirable. The playground movement, 
which at present is claiming much attention among social workers, may 
be criticized from this standpoint. 
The remaining adaptive instincts have a regulative value 
similar to that of play. Imitation and curiosity have 
already been discussed at some length. It is ° PR ° The value obvious that instinctive tendencies of all sorts 6¢ the other 
are essentially modified by the influence of the oo 
environment, which is consciously or uncon- 
sciously imitated. It is, of course, highly desirable that
-P-A-G-E-82
  58 The Learning Process 
the environment be of such a nature as to lead to the 
proper expression of the various instinctive tendencies. 
Generally much more can be accomplished in the realm of 
taste and morals in training instincts in the proper channels 
through this means than by any obviously direct methods. 
The school must, as far as possible, set the proper stand- 
ards in etiquette and general conduct. If this is done, 
many of the instincts will be properly regulated without 
more direct methods. 
Curiosity affords a most desirable means for restraining certain instinc- 
tive tendencies, and for redirecting others. For example, if the teacher 
can arouse in the pupil’s mind a genuine interest in any of the subjects 
of the curriculum, he has done more than merely to gain attention for 
that one subject; he has turned the mind away from other interests. 
The boy who has aroused in him curiosity to learn is less liable to yield 
to the migratory instinct, for example, and run away from school or 
home. What is true of curiosity is similarly true of constructiveness. 
Many a boy has been kept in school because of carpentry and forge 
work; not a few girls have found the curriculum attractive because of 
cooking and sewing. The strictly commercial courses, too, appeal to 
the instinct of constructiveness as well as to distinctively utilitarian 
ends. This appeal is primarily the justification for their introduction 
into the curriculum. Acquisitiveness manifests itself early in the child’s 
life in the form of the collecting and hoarding instinct. Children 
accumulate all sorts of objects with little definite purpose. Later their 
collections are made with a more conscious aim. Generally the nature 
of these collections is determined by the suggestions of the environ- 
ment. Children. collect stamps, cigar and tobacco tags, cigarette pic- 
tures, insects, geological and botanical specimens, dolls’ dresses, birds’ 
eggs, picture cards, coins, buttons, marbles, shells, rocks, etc., as the 
fashions and interests of the children dictate.1_ The value of this in- 
stinctive tendency in the learning process is too obvious to require 
extendedcomment. Like the other adaptive instincts, it possesses botha 
positive anda negative value; positive in furthering desirable tendencies 
and negative in inhibiting the undesirable. One of the less desirable .

forms that this instinct sometimes assumes is that of a strong develop- 
ment of the money-earning interest. As a result, the boy is drawn 
away from school at a time when he is ill prepared to enter upon the 
serious business of life. The instinct in this form should be held in 
check, and other instinctive interests that center about the school and 
its activities emphasized.

earlier stages of development than they are to- 
day. Indeed, in society as it is at present constituted, some 
of these are usually undesirable. Fear, as irrational ter- 
ror, is always to be eliminated. Yet under proper condi- 
tions it may rise to the dignity of one of the most important 
of the regulative instincts. Throughout the history of the 
race it has served as an important corrective influence in 
the modification and elimination of less powerful instinctive 
tendencies.1 The claim is often made that the child should 
be taught not to fear. This can, however, mean only that 
the child should be taught not to have irrational fear. 
Education may be defined, from one potnt of view, as the 
process of teaching the child to fear aright; to fear those 
things that willwork him harm. The fear of disobedience, 
of social disapproval, and the like, must be confirmed in 
the child. Any form of education that tries to banish fear 
in all its aspects will ultimately prove a failure.” 
Through the fear of punishment both the child and the 
race have been taught the safe path to follow. Reward 
and punishment, which have been the unvarying accom-

many studies whose immediate values cannot be shown the 
child, especially at the time when it is necessary to drill 
him in their fundamental elements. Other reasons than 
the ultimate aim and value of these studies must be the ones 
which appeal to the child at this stage of his learning. A 
proper and rational system of rewards and punishments will 
create an interest in the school work which it does not in- 
trinsically possess. It is the opinion of many teachers that 
corporal punishment is not desirable. There are, doubtless, 
extreme cases when itmay be necessary.1_ Many other forms 
of punishment which were in vogue years ago have been 
shown by experience to be ineffectual and unworthy. Such, 
for example, is the adding of extra tasks of excessive length 
for poor work, and the holding up of the child to the con- 
tempt of his schoolmates by putting him in a ridiculous 
light before them. The teacher should be extremely care- 
ful, for example, in the use of sarcasm at the expense of 
the pupil. Much has been said and written in recent years 
about the evils of the marking system. Teachers, however, 
are aware of the fact that children demand grades, and 
pupils often cannot comprehend the value of their school 
work without them.? Grades represent objectively the attain-

chology at the University of Illinois, it was found necessary by the experi- 
menters in order to keep the interest of the children at an optimal intensity, 
to assign to them marks indicating their accomplishments in these experiments,

ment of the child, and are a form of social approval or 
disapproval. Low marks for the normally ambitious pupil 
will generally act as a punishment severe enough to stimulate 
him to better work.1 Whatever form of punishment the 
teacher employs, he should be careful to make certain that 
this punishment actually associates itself with the mis- 
demeanor that is punished. As Bagley? has pointed 
out, the punishment of keeping a child after school and 
compelling him to study a lesson for the following day is 
likely to associate itself with the lesson rather than with 
the offense that has been committed. When possible, the 
punishment should follow the offense immediately. .

they are properly directed, may be of value. Superstition

It is one of these elements, however, which the property

utilitarian ideals, is not likely to inculcate in the minds of 
children and youth. It is well, therefore, to develop in the 
child a certain feeling of awe and mystery in regard to the 
higher things that surround him. Extreme intellectualism 
in religion will ultimately fail in bringing about the proper 
attitude toward the universe in its totality. Life is too 
uncertain and human knowledge too fragmentary to dis- 
pense with the mystical religious attitude. Just as super- 
stition may be transmuted into something of value when it 
is turned in the proper direction, so too envy, jealousy, 
and anger may be made worthy instincts, if they are 
properly controlled. We should envy another his happy 
disposition ; we should be jealous of a good reputation, and 
we should be thrilled with genuine anger at a base action.

  62 The Learning Process 
The most difficult problem in connection with the 
direction of instincts arises at the adolescent period of 
a development. At times the gravest tragedies 
instincts of have taken place through the attempt to pro- 
adolescence. hibit instinctive desires, when absolute prohi- 
bition is manifestly impossible. Fortunately youth is 
strongly idealistic, and in young men and women is often a 
passion for the noble and the beautiful. Hence the sex 
instinct may be held within proper limits by idealizing the 
object toward which it is directed. This is the time to in- 
culcate in the minds of young men the spirit of chivalry, 
courtesy, and honor, and in young women that of modesty 
and good taste. It is doubtful if coeducation at this 
period is desirable, since it tends to remove from the 
minds of young people some of the lofty ideals they natur- 
ally possess in regard to the opposite sex.’ At this period 
the religious and moral emotions, too, should be glorified by 
the noblest ideals. The adolescent should have constantly 
before him examples of beauty in art and literature; he 
should be led into friendly communication with nature; 
education at this period must not appeal to him too ex- 
clusively from the merely intellectual standpoint. Not — 
only should his mind be made to know the truths that lie 
about him, but his heart should be made to throb in 
sympathy with the beautiful and the good that permeate 
all life and to which he is now more susceptible than he 
ever will be again. The period of drill and mechanical 
regimen has passed, and the period of comprehension, 
self-direction, and sympathetic appreciation begun. 
The question of promoting the child in his school grade 
is closely related to the problem of the development of 
1 Hall has expressed this thought as follows (of. cit, II, p. 635): “Coedu- 
cation should cease at the dawn of adolescence, at least for a season. Great 
daily intimacy between the sexes in the high school, if not in the college, 
tends to rub off the bloom and delicacy which can develop in each, and girls 
suffer in this respect, let us repeat, far more than boys,”

  instincts. The intellectual attainments of the child, partic- 
ularly in the fundamental subjects of the school curricu- 
lum, as tested by the common methods in vogue The devel- 
for determining proficiency, are often the sole ppment of 
standards for promotion. In consequence of related to 
this, backward children are not uncommonly held Promoten 
in a grade in which most of the pupils are far grades. 
below these backward children as far as the development 
of instincts and interests is concerned. It is very rarely 
advisable to keep the child in a grade for more than two 
consecutive years. He either should be promoted, or if 
this seems impossible, he should be removed from the 
school and sent to some institution that can look out 
closely for his specific needs. It is obvious that markedly 
subnormal children, both for their own interests and for 
those of the normal children, should be segregated in 
special schools. 
The problem of allowing for the proper development 
and expression of instincts is closely related to the question 
of mental arrest. If the child, at an age when . 
certain instincts develop, finds in the school no steal of 
opportunity for the expression of these instincts, instinctive tendencies 
he may be permanently held at a low level of may cause 
intellectual and moral attainmentthereby. It is mental . arrest. 
therefore one of the most important problems of 
experimental pedagogy to determine the approximate time 
when theinstincts make their appearance. Itis a problemof 
equal importance for practical pedagogy to devise means 
for the wholesome expression of these instincts. Unfor- , 
tunately, these investigations have not been sufficiently 
extensive, nor the results so definite that a school program, 
or methods of instruction, can be determined in more than 
a general way. The previous discussion has, however, 
pointed out certain tendencies in the development and 
control of instincts that have obvious importance in the 
practice of the schools.

64 The Learning Process 
Rules for the acquisition and modifications of habit have 
been long definitely formulated, and so often emphasized 
Rules for that the briefest mention of them at this point 
the modifi- will suffice. James,! in his chapter on “ Habit” 
re ah has brought together these rules, as follows: 
laiddown ‘“‘ The first is that in the acquisition of a new

take care to launch ourselves with as strong and decided an 
initiative as possible. Accumulate all the possible circum- 
stances which shall reinforce the right motives. . . envelop 
your resolution with every aid you know. The second 
maxim is: Never suffer an exception to occur till the new 
habit is securely rooted in your life. ... Continuity of 
training is the great means of making the nervous system 
act infallibly right.... A third maxim may be added to the 
preceding pair: Seize the very first possible opportunity to 
act on every Fr. solution you make, and on every emotional 
prompting you may experience in the direction of the hab- 
its you aspire to gain. ... No matter how full a reservoir of 
maxims one may possess, and no matter how good one’s sen- 
timents may be, if one have not taken advantage of every 
concrete opportunity to act, one’s character may remain 
entirely unaffected forthe better. ... Asa final practical 
maxim relative to these habits of the will, we may, then, 
offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive 
in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day.” Itshould 
further be added that habit formation may be negative as 
well as positive, and may consist in refraining from doing 
something for which there is a natural or acquired tendency. 
The direction of habit is largely determined by the direction 
of attention. This is particularly important in habit break- 
ing, which is largely a matter of voluntary effort. 
The most important law of habit formation has been 
formulated by Bagley? as the “focalization of conscious-

ness upon the process to be automatized, plus attentive repe- 
tition of this process, permitting no exceptions until auto- 
matism results.” The great difficulty in habit qye taw of 
building seems to lie first in securing the proper ea . . . . on in

habit is to be formed. It is particularly essential in the 
beginning of all school activities that the teacher see to it 
that the pupil’s attention is upon that part of the learning 
which is essential for the correct formation of the habit de- 
sired. 
Book 1} and Swift,? as was stated in the last chapter, have both | 
‘pointed out that in learning, variations in method appear as accidents, | 
and that these variations build themselves up into habits, quite without | 
the direction of consciousness, while Ruger * disputes this assertion as 
far as the latter part of the statement is concerned. He says that the 
results of his puzzle experiments “are in accord with this view so far as 
the coming of variations is concerned, but not as t> subsequent rela- 
tions, the employment of the variations. A large perc itage of the for- 
tunate variations camealtogether unpremeditatedly.” Onthe other hand, 
“The value of the variations . . . seems to have varied rather directly 
with the precision with which they were analyzed, and with the extent to 
which they were treated as hypotheses to be systematically tested with 
subsequent adoption or rejection. In other words, the drops in the 
curves, the time being variable, were coincident with consciously adopted 
variations rather than with the ‘unconscious ’ ones.” The conclusions 
of Ruger, then, are in agreement with Bagley’s contention that habits 
to be learned must be focalized. This point of view has the advantage 
of offering a definite method of procedure in teaching habit, while the 
contentions of Book and Swift leave the whole process a matter of 
chance.

particularly in the work of the first grade, the pe prob- 
problem before the teacher is principally that of lem of pil ia. ; , ° initiating properly initiating right habits, such as habits of habits

> ~— 66 The Learning Process 
that the first maxim laid down by James is to be particu: 
larly regarded. The teacher must take every opportunity 
to impress upon the pupils the necessity of acquiring the 
habit, and to provide the proper incentives for drill in the 
formation of these habits. 
When the child first enters the school, the habit that must be at- 
tended to, perhaps above all others, is that of correct carriage of the 
body, particularly when the child is seated at work at his desk. Almost 
invariably the beginning pupils assume incorrect attitudes. They do 
not sit erect in their seats, they squirm about, and in nearly every way 
place themselves in positions that are calculated to interfere with their 
physical well-being and their mental alertness. The skillful teacher may 
‘correct these tendencies and initiate desirable habits by certain simple 
devices of holding the attention on the necessity of sitting erect and 
of keeping an attitude of alertness. He may begin by reading them a 
story about soldiers; and when he has brought to the minds of his 
pupils the fact that these soldiers stand erect and keep strict attention 
to the commands of their officers, he may point out to the children one 
of the rows in the room that is giving the best attention, and say, 
“ That is a soldier’s row.” By this means the teacher emphasizes at 
the very outset the importance of correct bodily attitudes, and initiates 
the habit with a strong impetus. 
Again it may be the purpose of the teacher to emphasize the impor- 
tance of clear and loud speech. To do this he may, for example, dram- 
atize the story of Little Red Riding Hood. He asks various children 
to take the parts of the characters in the story. To a girl who speaks 
so low that she can scarcely be heard by the others, he assigns the part 
of reading the story at those places where the various characters do not 
speak; to a boy who has the like fault of not speaking out because of 
bashfulness he gives the rdle of the wolf. He does not, however, make’ 
the mistake of assigning all the parts in the drama to children who are 
bashful and weak of voice. Some of these parts he gives to the chil- 
dren that speak the most clearly, in order that they may serve as exam- 
ples for the rest. This makes the indistinct speech of the others more 
striking by contrast; and when the little girl who is reading the story 
fails to make herself heard by the others, they spontaneously call out, 
“ Louder, louder”; also, when the wolf does not growl in a whole- 
hearted way, and when he mumbles his words, the children likewise 
express their disapproval. By such means as these, the skillful teacher 
can launch the essential school habits with an emphasis that with fur- 
ther drill will insure their continuance in most instances until perfected. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  The Educability of Instincts and Habits 67 
One of the most frequent difficulties in correct habit 
formation in the school lies in disregarding the second 
maxim quoted from James, namely, that an ; : The pupil exception must never occur during the forma- must prac- 
tion of the habit. If the child is to write well tice desir- 
and speak well, he must write and speak well ee 
on all occasions.. The pupil often gains the impression 
that correct language, whether written or spoken, is a 
matter that concerns his formal language work alone, 
and that he need not trouble himself about the use of 
correct English in general. This attitude may remain 
with the pupil throughout his entire career as a student. 
It not infrequently happens that members of university 
classes forget that they have obligation to write or speak 
well in the work connected with other courses than those 
offered by the department of English. The third maxim of 
James concerns more largely moral education than it does 
the education given in the common branches. However, 
since the school must consider the moral life of the pupil, 
the principle involved in this maxim should not be disre- 
garded. It is not sufficient to urge the pupil to practice 
good manners, and then let the matter drop there. He. 
should exhibit courtesy on all possible occasions in the 
schoolroom and about the school building. The school is 
well adapted to teach the social virtues in a concrete way, 
provided that the teachers insist on the pupil utilizing 
every opportunity for their expression. 
In practically all of the experiments performed in the 
acquisition of skill, as has previously been pointed out, the 
investigators have shown that at certain stages phe ayoid- 
in the progress of habit formation, plateaus, or ca 
periods of no, or slight, improvement in the ip habit 
learning have manifested themselves. If Book’s formation. 
theory in regard to the nature of plateaus is the correct 
point of view, we cannot regard them as useful in the 
incubation of higher habit formations. They should, “é 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  68 The Learning Process a 
be eliminated as soon as possible, and always reduced to a 
minimum. When the teacher discovers that the pupil has 
reached a long period of mental arrest, he should do all in 
his power to aid the pupil in overcoming the difficulties. 
If the arrest is due to bad and wasteful habits of work, as 
is sometimes the case, the effort should be made to correct 
these. For example, if the pupil, after making reasonable 
progress in number work, at length fails to advance in the 
rapidity and accuracy of performing the elementary proc- 
esses, this may be due to the fact that he has not suff- 
ciently mastered the arithmetical tables, and that he is 
spending time in “thinking them out,” when he should 
have them at “his tongue’s end,” or perhaps his difficulty 
lies in care and neatness in the written operation. What- 
ever the cause may be, the teacher should strive to discover 
it, and then remedy the difficulty. Subjective attitudes have 
been shown to be of significance in these periods of arrest 
in learning. Therefore the teacher should give the pupil 
at these stages all the encouragement possible, should seek 
to secure for him some added success, because of its stimu- 
lating effect, and should urge him to persevere. Since at 
these times there is a falling off of spontaneous interest, 
artificial methods of stimulating interest may be employed. 
The mature student who is directing his own learning 
should recognize the necessity of these temporary crises, 
and be prepared to rise above them through consistent 
endeavor. He should at times put forth maximal effort, 
since in this way, sometimes at least, habits shoot together 
on a higher plane, and thus a permanent improvement is 
achieved. It is well, too, in the school to have special 
occasions at which unusual effort is demanded. 
We have already commented on the fact that spontaneous 
interest is one of the prime essentials in correct habit 
formation. When the interest begins to wane, the skill 
falls off. For this reason Book recommends that the child 
c stop work when the interest is gone. There is a
-P-A-G-E-93
  The Educability of Instincts and Habits 69 
danger in too literally following this advice. Temporary 
loss of interest may, and often should, be overcome. Ob- 
viously it would be entirely undesirable to ac- ye neces- 
custom the pupil to abandon work with the ap- Sity of ° . : interest

worthy results. On the other hand, when it is quite evi- 
dent that the child has lost all interest for the time, the 
teacher may wisely vary the nature of the work, or intro- 
duce a period of play or recreation, as may seem best. A 
task that is conducted on the dead level of monotony over 
a long period is scarcely worth the effort it costs ; indeed, 
its results may be positively injurious in habit formation. 
Both the teacher and the mature student are often not 
aware of the natural fluctuation in interest in learning; 
therefore they are prone to take too seriously the pe guctua- 
falling-off in accomplishment that is apt to occur tion of — 
from time to time. The teacher who thinks of Cee 
the zest with which his pupils began the work !earning. 
of the new term or the new course, and who compares it 
with the painful lack of enthusiasm and interest that may 
appear when a few weeks have passed, need not attribute 
these discouraging conditions to poor teaching on his part 
nor to inferior intelligence on the part of the pupils. He 
must remember that as the pupils acquire greater knowledge 
and master more details, interest will surely return, and 
with it, successful accomplishment. The student, too, who 
finds his course of study less attractive after some time 
than he did at first, should not conclude that he should 
abandon it for that reason. If he thinks that the subject 
is worth while for him, he should stick to his task, with the 
confidence that when he has reached the expert stage he 
will have a genuine and direct interest in it for its own 
sake. 
Habit, which, we have seen, is on the basis of unconscious 
adjustment, should be only a part of the aim of the learn-

ing process. We should never be satisfied with a training 
that merely mechanizes. Drill is essential at all stages of 
Habit the learning process. In recent years there 
formation have been in certain quarters evidences of a 
should be@ tendency to minimize the value of drill. This 
not the end, is to be distinctly deplored. However, educa- 
of learning. tion can never end with drill. It must lead 
the child to interpret his environment, and find new ele- 
ments in it to which he must adjust himself. The girl in 
number work who ‘said that she could do the problem all 
right if she knew whether she should “ times it” or “into 
it”’ had the drill, but not the point of view beyond the 
drill. Observational studies, such as geography and nature 
work, that suggest to the child that he has a field of knowl- 
edge to explore, are excellent correctives of the deadening 
influence of drill in the earlier stages of development. 
Most of the studies that have been introduced to “ enrich 
the curriculum” have been of this character. When the 
individual has reached the higher stages of learning, philo- 
sophical interpretation and a genuine curiosity to know 
are incentives which lead him beyond the merely formal 
and mechanical aspects of the learning process. As the 
Herbartians have said, the aim of education is the creation 
of permanent interests. J¢ zs not the facts and habits that 
have been acquired in the learning process that count as much 
as wt ts the disposition to learn new facts and acquire new 
habits. It is important that the teacher should always 
have the attitude of a learner, and convey to the minds of 
the pupils the subtle sense that no knowledge is ever an 
absolutely completed and closed set of facts; that no activi- 
ties, however comprehensive and satisfactory, are ever 
final.

CHAPTER V / 
SENSATION AND PERCEPTION | 
Ur to the present point in this discussion, the nature of 
the learning process has been considered largely in terms 
of its objective features, namely, in terms of the «ious 
adjustments made by the organism in adapting ness must 
itself to its environment. Consciousness has ee 
been treated as arising only where there appears chief factor 
to be a necessity for it in terms of adjustment. ‘/°*™9& 
These objective biological considerations, however, are 
entirely inadequate and incomplete unless we consider the 
conscious processes that accompany adjustment. Indeed, 
the learning process, as far as education is concerned, must 
be approached largely through the subjective elements 
correlated with the objective adjustments. We now turn 
to consider, briefly, the most simple of these various con- 
scious processes, namely, sensation. 
When we attempt to define or describe sensation, we 
find the same difficulty that confronted us at the outset of 
our discussion in attempting to define conscious- : 
ness in general, namely, the difficulty of de- suet 
scribing an elementary experience in terms of pie st 
anything more fundamental and elementary. 
We can say, if we choose, that sensation is the primitive 
stuff of consciousness; the noetic or intellectual aspect of 
mentality, and that from it develop all higher intellectual 
processes; but this statement throws very little light upon 
the real nature of a sensory experience. Perhaps the only 
description that we can give of sensation, a description 
that is entirely inadequate, because it is in physiological 
terms, is that a sensory experience is the conscious cor-

relate of the stimulation of an end organ and the transfer- 
ence of this stimulation to appropriate brain centers. We 
can further add that the experience aroused in this way is 
something new, and is not brought into relation with any 
previous experience. In other words, there has been no 
working over on the subjective side of the raw sense 
material, but the whole experience is entirely immediate 
and without reference to anything beyond itself. Sucha 
state as this is what is described by James? under the term 
“pure experience.” 
It is doubtful if such a pure experience ever actually ex- 
ists. It certainly does not exist in any developed form of 
Asensory Consciousness, and, therefore, is a hypothetical 
experience element to be inferred, but not to be demon- both sen- 
soryand trated. As we have already seen, the sensory 
ait aa experience demands for its completion an ad- 
justment to some object connected with this experience, 
and, therefore, sensation can never be taken as something 
complete in itself. Even in visual experience, there must 
be actual adjustments before a world of tri-dimensional 
space, filled with objects, can ever be known. The infant 
early in life has the possibility of seeing, — z.e. the retina 
is functional and responds to the appropriate light stim- 
ulus shortly after birth, and later the proper sensory con- 
nections with the higher brain centers are perfected. 
Although this is a fact, the child cannot in any genuine 
sense perceive visual objects for some time. In the act of 
vision, beyond the functioning of the retina and the devel- 
opment and connection of neural paths to the higher cen- 
ters, is involved the adjustment of the eye through its in- 
ternal and external muscles to the object to be seen. The 
lens must be focused, or accommodated, and the two eyes 
must be made to move in harmony, —they must be prop-

I, p. 485 (1904). “The instant field of the present is at all times what I call the 
‘pure,’ experience,” he writes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  Sensation and Perception 73 
erly converged upon the object of vision. Itis often thought 
that the only thing the child has to do is to look out upon 
a world of objective reality and have it photographed in all 
its details in a purely passive way. Nothing could be farther 
from the truth. If the eye were purely a passive organ, no 
genuine visual experience could ever arise. There can be 
no visual sensation except in a visual experience requiring 
a reaction on the part of the organism. What is true 
of visual sensation is equally true of the pressure sensation. 
Mere passive touch could in no way acquaint us with the 
world as we know it in developed consciousness. There 
are also adjustments in hearing, and in taste and smell as 
well, which give to the auditory, gustatory, and olfactory 
sensations an objective meaning and significance. When 
we consider the so-called kinzsthetic sensations, — 2.e. 
those sensations arising from the muscles, joints, and ten- 
dons, we find that the very existence of these sensations is 
conditioned by the adjustments which involve muscular 
contraction. No further elaboration is necessary to em- 
phasize the fact that sensory experience without adjustment 
is an impossibility, and that a sensory experience is never 
merely sensory, but motor as well. 
It must be kept in mind that what is often called a sen- 
sation is in reality a perception, z.e. it is an experience which 
is due not merely to the stimulation arising from what we

experiences with that object or similar objects. reality 
In other words, a fully conscious experience Perception. — 
never exists without an element of meaning. This meaning 
arises because of the experience previously acquired with the 
object through adjustments to it. For example, the visual 
experience of an orange, in so far as it is a mere visual 
sensation, is nothing more than color and form. How- 
- ever, the actual orange, which is not merely sensed, but 
perceived, means much more than the visual sensation as 
such can mean. Indeed, it is doubtful if any meaning

could be attached to a visual experience that had not con- 
nected with it something of the past.!

more definitely later, the entire psychology of 
learning has as its final principle of interpretation and ex- 
planation this same law of purpose. Sensation, however, 
as such, appears to arise entirely independent of any such 
purpose on the part of the organism, and, therefore, to fall 
outside of the learning process. The question may then 
naturally arise as to the justification of considering this topic 
here in a discussion of the psychology of learning. The 
reply to such an objection is easily made. Sensations are 
the materials which are to be organized through the expe- 
riences of the individual. Whzle sensations alone could 
never give us any knowledge of the world about us, they are 
absolutely indispensable for such knowledge. It is safe to 
assume that there is nothing in our conscious life that can- 
not be reduced, in its most fundamental form, either to sen- 
sations, or to affection. It will be maintained in a later 
chapter that there is no pure thought as such that does not 
contain, as its basis, sensory material. 
It will further be seen that while the individual organism 
may in no way choose its sensory experiences consciously,

We must also keep in mind the fact that developed sen-

arise entirely independent of the individual’s conscious 
aims. This the following consideration will make more 
apparent. As we have already said, perception we control

sation, and thus gaining a practical familiarity with it. 
Now this adjustment is by no means entirely a matter of 
indifference, and generally the kind of adjustment that is 
made is in the higher learning processes a matter more or 
less of deliberate choice. We determine, then, to a consta- 
erable degree consciously what our perceptions shall be. Fur- 
ther, if we extend the notion of purpose to unconscious choice, 
we can say that there 1s no perception that does not arise un- 
der the dominance of some end. : 
In general the newborn child has less vivid and less ac- 
tive sensations than the older child or the adult. Before 
birth the child has doubtless experienced a few py, chita’s 
dim sensations. The foetus is capable of move- sensory 
ment during the last months before birth, and, at 
therefore, has the possibility of vague kinzes- than that of 
thetic sensations. The possibility of pronounced “¢ #4 
dermal sensation is practically excluded on account of the 
medium in which the embryo develops. However, there 
may be certain sensations of pain and of the internal 
organs. At birth, and shortly after, there rushes in upon 
the child a flood of sensory stimuli. Immediately with 
birth the child breathes for the first time, and with breath- 
ing there comes the possibility of sensations arising from 
the respiratory tract. The child, too, has the possibilities, 
for the first time, of the dermal sensations of temperature, 
and pain is perhaps first sensed at the time of birth. The 
sensation of pressure, of course, exists as a possibility be- 
fore and during birth. Light stimuli begin to affect the 
eye of the child in a few hours after birth, and within the 
first forty-eight hours the middle ear is generally freed
-P-A-G-E-100
  76 The Learning Process 
from the mucus which prevents the possibility of hearing 
before this time. Early in the child’s post-natal existence 
there are more or less definite reactions to taste stimuli, 
but olfactory stimuli seem to possess little effect for some 
time. In the main we can say that in the early months of 
the child’s life he possesses all the possibilities of sensation 
that he will later have, but that most of his sensory expe- 
riences are more vague and less definite than they are with 
the adult. 
In two particulars, however, the infant, after a certain 
period of development, undoubtedly possesses greater 
Taste and Possibilities of sensory experience than he will 
touchinthe later on in his life. The dermal end organs 
agian are probably as numerous as they will ever be, 
while the total surface of the child’s body is much less 
than it will be when he has reached maturity. For this 
reason the basis of sensory discrimination of the dermis 
may be much finer in the case of the child than of the 
adult. Also the little child is provided with a large num- 
ber of taste buds in the cheeks. For this reason he gets 
pleasure in stuffing his mouth with food. With these two 
exceptions, however, it is safe to say that during the first 
year of a child’s life his sensory experiences are inferior 
to those of the mature individual. Notwithstanding this 
fact, the relative importance of sensory experience is greater 
for the child than for the adult. Children are more con- 
crete in their attitudes, the perceptive and interpretative 
elements are less. Their attention is largely of the sen- 
sory type, and is determined in a passive way. 
Sensory defects may vary all the way from the absolute 
lack of one or more of the senses, as in the case of Helen 
Keller,! or Laura Bridgman, to slight defects in vision or 
in hearing. Children who are deprived of sight or hearing 
show, apparently, mental defects, but these are not due

necessarily to any lack in the nervous system itself, but 
rather to the fact that the sense stimuli are not received 
and reported to their appropriate brain centers. >. oay- 
The congenital deaf-mute is handicapped in in- cation of 
tellectual development. This is largely due to ae ae 
the fact that without special education such a sensory 
child is unable to learn spoken language. And i 
since the spoken word is important in the development of 
the higher intellectual processes, the deaf-mute’s lack of 
ability to speak is a pronounced drawback to his mental 
progress. When deaf-mutism and congenital or early ac- 
quired blindness are found in the same person, the diffi- 
culty of education is, of course, much greater, since the 
only sense department of much value in the learning 
process that remains is the tactile sense, including the 
kinzesthetic. That education even under such circum- 
stances is not altogether impossible, the high intellec- 
tual attainments of Helen Keller, and, at an earlier time, 
of Laura Bridgman, bear witness. There are other 
cases also on record where a similar education has been 
in part possible under similar conditions.1. Other children 
it has been found impossible to raise above the stage of 
idiocy when apparently similarly afflicted. The remark- 
able fact remains, however, that in a few cases, at least, 
it has been possible to educate to a high standard of in- 
tellectual proficiency individuals whose effective sensory 
experience was limited to the kinzsthetic and tactile sen- 
sations. The learning process is evidently possible with 
a paucity of sensation, but this does not imply that learn- 
ing can proceed with no sensory experience whatsoever. 
1 One of the most interesting of these cases is that of Emma Kubicek, who 
was present at the meeting of the Illinois State Teachers’ Association at Spring- 
field, Illinois, December, 1905. Miss Kubicek was presented to the Child 
Study section by her teacher, Helen R. Jordan.. The unfortunate girl was 
blind, deaf, and dumb, but her other senses were remarkably acute, and her 
general intelligence high. Miss Kubicek has since died,

of these defects; even the parent may not know of their 
existence; and yet they may be, from the standpoint of 
the learning of the child, sufficient to greatly hinder his 
progress. | 
Defects in vision are extremely common. A consider- 
able number of investigations have been made in regard 
ee to the eyesight of school children, which 
te -wiglon show that absolutely perfect vision is decidedly 
extremely the exception rather than the rule. The most common. ° 
common of these visual defects are what are 
technically known as errors of refraction, which are of 
three kinds, namely, myopia, or near-sightedness, hyper- 
metropia, or far-sightedness, and astigmatism. Myopia is 
due to the fact that the fundus of the eye is so far removed 
from the lens that the rays of light are brought to focus 
in front of the retina, and, diverging again, they cause a 
blurring of the vision. Hypermetropia is due to the op- 
posite defect, and the rays of light are not brought toa 
focus soon enough to give clear vision. Astigmatism is 
due to irregular curvature, generally of the cornea, which 
is itself a refracting medium. If the curvature is greater, 
for example, in one meridian than in another, the lens 
cannot properly accommodate for both, and the result is 
that while part of the rays of light are brought to a focus, 
1Sometimes the parent is aware of defects of vision or hearing in the child, 
but when spoken to about such defects by the principal or superintendent, 
replies, “ Yes, I know he cannot see very well, but he was always so.” This 
fatalistic attitude is a serious drawback to improvement in many cases,
-P-A-G-E-103
  Sensation and Perception 79 
others are not. Often a pupil advances through the grades 
and the preparatory school before it is discovered that his 
vision is impaired. One case in point called to the writer’s 
attention was that of a young man with so marked a 
case of myopia that he had only one-twelfth visual acuity. 
When he first was fitted with glasses, he thought that they 
must be imperfect, because he noticed on looking at the 
floor certain lines, which he afterwards learned to be cracks 
in the floor. This young man had worked for many years 
with vision so poor that he had never known that the 
floor contained cracks. Itis perfectly obvious that such 
grave defects as this must be remedied if suitable progress 
is made in learning. 
Visual defects do not always show themselves in marked 
decrease in acuity. Sometimes when the vision is not 
strikingly subnormal there result eyestrain, ner- y, 
vousness, headaches, stomach troubles, and _ physical 
perhaps more or less general ill health. It isa ee au 
safe principle to proceed on that when there is visual 
any considerable visual abnormality, whether it **f¢ 
is sufficient or not to interfere seriously with the ordinary 
school work, this defect should be remedied at once.! 
Less common but more serious than defects in vision are 
1 Allen, in his book on “ Civics and Health,” Boston, 1909, says: ‘‘ Wherever 
school children’s eyes have been examined, from six to nine out of thirty are 
found to be nearsighted, farsighted, or otherwise in need of attention. A 
child is dismissed from school for obstinately declaring that the letter between

brought to me by her teacher with the statement that she did unreasonably 
poor work in reading for an intelligent and willing child; a boy is punished 
for being backward. These three cases are typical. Examinations showed 
that the first child was astigmatic and not obstinate ; the boy had run a pin 
into one eye ten years before and destroyed its sight ; while the second girl 
was found to be afflicted with diplopia, and in a friendly chat told the follow- 
ing story : ‘I very often see two words where there is only one. When I 
was a very little girl I used to write every word twice. Then I was scolded for 
being careless. So I learned that I must not say two words, even when I saw 
them.’ ”?

those arising from hearing. In a series of investigations 
in the Washington schools, teachers reported defects in 
hearing among boys at sixty-seven hundredths Defects : . ° 
inhearing percent, and among girls at thirty-six hundredths 
oftenseri- per cent. Recent tests in New York City ous. 
schools showed one and one tenth per cent of the 
children tested had defective hearing. Other tests have 
shown children defective in hearing in some cases as high 
as thirty per cent. The great difference in the various re- 
sults is due in part to difference in methods of testing the 
children. In those tests where the percentage is very 
small the methods have been crude and inaccurate. Not 
infrequently a child who is defective in hearing is classed 
by his teachers as stupid! His normal development is, 
therefore, seriously arrested, and perhaps permanently 
interfered with. Children differ not only in visual and 
auditory acuity, but also in the acuity of other senses; for 
example, the sensibility to pain and to pressure is not the 
same for all individuals, and may vary with the same in- 
dividual from time to time. Fineness of dermal sensation 
is also a variable quality, as is also the sensitivity to taste © 
and to smell. These variations, however, except in patho- 
logical cases, have relatively slight significance in the 
learning process.

It is generally believed that sensitivity among defectives 
and delinquents is less than among normal individuals. 
Italian investigators have foundamong criminals ecaies 
that general sensitivity is one sixth, and sensi- among de- 
tivity to pain two fifths, less than in the average deinen 
person. There is a general obtuseness in touch, 
except among swindlers and thieves. Color blindness, 
which is a defect more common among men than women, 
is found to be also greater among criminals than among 
normal persons. Bono reports sixty per cent of two 
hundred and twenty-one youthful criminals color-blind.

fifty per cent of the hundred murderers investigated by him

  CHAPTER VI 
NATURE OF PERCEPTION IN THE CHILD 
In the above discussion of sensation, a contrast has been 
drawn between sensation and perception. As has already 
been said, sensation is the crude stuff by means an per- 
of which the world of external reality is brought ception He St ie 5 . dependent 
to the individual experience. Before this on previous 
raw material can be utilized, however, it must ¢*Perience. 
be interpreted. So it happens that at the basis of every _ 
developed experience there lies a perception, and it follows 
further that the more extended the experience of the indi- 
vidual is, both in particular and in general, the wider is his 
range of perception. 
The world of the little child is very narrow, and in many 
respects indefinite. Often the child of six or gy igiesin 
seven cannot discriminate colors with any degree range of 
of accuracy, though girls are more capable than Tye fea, 
boys in this respect. Temporal and spatial rela- experi-_ 
tions are not well understood, and are gradually ™*"* 
comprehended only through practical necessities. The 
child’s perceptions are often fantastic and emotional. 
A number of studies have been made to determine the 
range and nature of the perceptions of the child at the be- 
ginning of the school age. The first of these experiments 
was performed in Berlin, under the direction of the Peda- 
gogical Verein, in 1870, and the principal results reported 
by Bartholomai. They indicated that the Berlin child pos- 
sessed relatively meager perceptions at the time of enter- 
ing school; but more definite facts can hardly be deduced 
with any degree of certainty.

  84 The Learning Process 
Nine years later Karl Lange carried on a similar experi- 
ment in Plauen. He asked the children fourteen different 
Similar questions; for example, who had seen the sun, 
experiments moonandstars? The principal result of Lange’s 
or i. experiment was that city children knew less of 
Hall’sex- natural phenomenathancountrychildren. Other 
periments. experiments of a like nature were carried on in 
various German cities, and the following year G. Stanley 
Hall “undertook, soon after the opening of the Boston 
' Schools in September, 1880, the making out of a list of 
questions, suitable for an inventory of the contents of the 
minds of children of average intelligence on entering the 
primary schools of the city.” } 
Hall, in discussing the results, says: ‘The high rate 
of ignorance indicated by the tables may surprise most 
Children persons. ... Skeins and spools of thread were 
es said to grow on the sheep’s back or on bushes, 
ignorance stockings on trees, butter to come from butter- 
Dod shane cups, flour to be made of beans, oats to grow on 
facts. oaks, bread to be swelled yeast, trees to be 
stuck in the ground by God and to be rootless, meat to be 
dug from the ground, and potatoes to be picked from trees. 
Cheese is squeezed butter, the cow says ‘bow-wow,’ the 
pig purrs or burrows, worms are not distinguished from 
snakes, moss from the ‘toad’s umbrella,’ bricks from stone. 
. .. So that, while no one child has all these misconcep- 
tions, none are free from them and thus the liabilities are 
great that in this chaos of half-assimilated impressions, 
1 In order to avoid the errors arising through suggestion and emulation of 
children questioned in large groups, “four trained and experienced kinder- 
garten teachers were employed by the hour, to question the children in groups 
of three ata time. About sixty teachers, beside the four examiners, made re- 
turns from three or more children each. ... From more than twice that 
number, two hundred of the Boston children were selected as a basis,” forthe 
tables drawn up. Shortly after the publication of these tables Superintendent 
J. M. Greenwood of Kansas City tested six hundred and seventy-eight children 
of the lowest primary class in that city; forty-seven of these were colored.

half right, half wrong, some lost link may make utter non- 
sense or mere verbal cram of the most careful instruction, 
as in the cases of children referred to above, who knew 
much by rote about a cow, its milk, horns, leather, meat, 
etc., but yet were sure from the picture book that it was 
no bigger than a small mouse.” 
Hall summarizes the result of the experiment as follows: 
“(1) That there is next to nothing of pedagogic value, 
the knowledge of which is safe to assume at the Suveniale 
outset of school life. ... (2) The best prep- of Hall’s 
aration parents can give their children for good °™lusions. 
school training is to make them acquainted with natural 
objects, especially with the sights and sounds of the coun- 
try. ... (3) Every teacher, in starting with a new class 
or in a new locality, to make sure that his efforts along 
some lines are not utterly lost, should undertake to explore © 
carefully section by section children’s minds. .. . (4) The 
concepts which are most common in the children of a 
given locality are the earliest to be acquired, while the 
rarer ones come later.’’ To thissummary should be added 
the fact that children form many of their ideas from the 
most absurd verbal analogies, and have behind them 
practically no concrete notion of the significance of these 
ideas. Further, that in their ideas of natural phenomena | 
they are strangely anthropomorphic and mythopeeic. God 
lights the stars so that he can see to go on the sidewalk 
or into church. When people die they are slung up into 
the sky, where God catches them. Thunder is perceived 
as God groaning, or kicking, or rolling barrels, or turning 
a big handle, or grinding snow, talking aloud, and so forth. 
Lightning is God striking many matches at once. He 
keeps rain in heaven in a big sink or a big tub or barrel. 
God lights the stars with matches, or blows them out.’

Review, Vol. II, pp. 249-272, May, 1883. It was later reprinted as a sep-

    86 The Learning Process 
In 1880-1884 Dr. B. Hartmann! made similar tests in 
the Annaberg schools. The results obtained do not differ 
_ greatly from those reached by Hall. The great 
Annaberg advantage of the Annaberg investigation over 
Paarl that of previous experiments lies in the fact 
that it was continued for five years. Hartmann 
found that the per cent of known concepts varied enor- 
mously in accordance with the field from which the 
questions are chosen; for example, only 128 children knew 
what a triangle was, while 564 were familiar with the 
circle and 1056 with the globe. Meumann,? commenting 
on this, says, ‘“ we see from this that the triangle is not 
psychologically the most simple and best known figure, 
as Herbart falsely assumed; the logically simple is not 
necessarily psychologically simple and elementary.” 
Still other experiments have been carried on in later 
years by Superintendent Seyffert in Zwickau, who con-

terms of the Ception, and that it isthe tendency of children 
old. to hold their perceptions to the known and to 
distinguish the new and exceptional in terms of the old. 
' Meumann concludes that this is both a pedagogical advan- 
tage and disadvantage. The advantage consists in the 
fact that the teacher can connect the new with the old in 
developing the child’s perceptions. The disadvantage is to 
be found in the fact that the new is often conceived in terms 
of the old, and is not comprehended in its essential qualities. 
Therefore, the pedagogical rule of always bringing the new 
into connection with the old has its dangers.®

works. Those things for which the child has interest are 
much better known than things for which he has no inter- 
est. Things which arouse feelings of unpleasantness seem 
to be better known than things which arouse pleasurable 
feelings. In general there is a great paucity of perception 
in the child of six years. It is uncertain, unsystematic, 
and lacks penetrating analysis. It is filled with an imag- 
inary completion of the gaps of perception, and contains 
gross verbal inaccuracies. _Meumann considers the dictum 
entirely wrong that Biblical history and fables are the 
proper materials for the first school years. The child 
lacks an understanding of the temporal relations which- 
lie at the basis of all history, while his tendency to form 
analogies, to draw on his imagination whenever neces- 
sary and interpret his perceptions subjectively, make the 
myth and fable unsuitable material for the beginning 
school years. On the other hand, the emphasis of con- 
crete instruction by the use of models and natural ob- 
jects is a sane one. This last statement is doubtless too 
extreme. The value of myth and fable will be discussed 
later. 
Since perception is the interpretation of the present sen- 
sory stimulus in terms of past experience, the possibility 
arises that such an interpretation may be wrong. 
ce eo Sensation could be neither true nor false. As mere 
true nor sensation it would simply exist. On the other 
ace hand, the perception goes beyond the present 
may be true sensory experience, and is implicitly a construc- 
orfalse. tion in terms of a mental content that has been 
acquired. The mere sensation of redness would be a real- 
ity, whether it were due to an external stimulation or to 
some activity confined to the retina; the perception of an 
externally red object, however, may be valid or notin terms 
of the objective or subjective nature of the stimulus. It 
makes no difference to the mere sensory experience what 
the nature of the stimulus is ; it does make a difference,
-P-A-G-E-113
  Nature of Perception in the Child 8g 
- however, in the interpretation of this experience, that is, it 
makes a difference in conduct. 
There are two varieties of false perceptions, namely, 
illusion and hallucination. The difference be- pistinction 
tween these as ordinarily given is that the between 5 ; ? : illusion and 
former is due to the inadequate interpretation hatucina- 
of an objectively existing stimulus, while the ia. 
latter is due to a false interpretation arising from purely 
subjective causes, no objective stimulus being present. 
For example, on a foggy day, objects seen through the mist often 
assume gigantic proportions, the reason for this being that under ordi- 
nary conditions an object casting the same sized retinal image and 
possessing the same indistinctness of outline would be much farther 
away than it is in reality under the unusual atmospheric conditions. 
Since it is judged as being farther away, it also is judged as being 
larger than it actually is. An external stimulus is present, but it is 
not accurately interpreted. The example of an hallucination is found 
most clearly in cases of mental disease where the patient, for example, 
hears voices that do not exist or sees forms not visible to other eyes. 
The above distinction between illusion and hallucination 
is not, however, an entirely valid one. In the first place, 
the hallucination is not generally due to purely wie? 
subjective conditions, and the difference between jon dis- 
it and illusion seems to be a matter of degree, tinction not valid. 
rather than of kind. The person who sees a 
mirage on the horizon and interprets it as a city near at 
hand, has, indeed, an objective stimulus which sets up the 
illusion; but the person who hears imaginary voices plot- 
ting his destruction finds also a stimulus for his halluci- 
natory experience in certain sounds objective to the ear. 
Even the unfortunate victim of alcoholic mania, who con- 
strues his heightened retinal circulation into horrible objects 
in the external world, has as a basis for his hallucination, 
not a stimulus outside his body, but, nevertheless, one that 
is objective to the centrally aroused nervous processes. 
The distinction between illusion and hallucination is 
pragmatic or practical, and in the last analysis is to be

found in the interpretation of these false perceptions in 
terms of a wider experience. An illusion may be defined 
er ae as a normal false perception (that is, a false 
distinction perception which ordinary persons would experi- 
is practical. nce under similar conditions), which does not 
agree with the more extended experience of the individual 
or individuals experiencing the illusion. An hallucination, 
on the other hand, may be defined as an abnormal false 
perception (that is, a perception which the mentally sound 
individual would not experience under similar conditions), 
which does not agree with the experiences of healthy 
minded individuals in general. The individual who ex- 
periences an illusion discovers the fact by trying out his 
perception, and finding that it does not work in his wider 
experience. For example, a system of mirrors may make 
a bouquet of flowers appear to be resting in a vase, when 
in reality it is in an entirely different position. To all 
normal people this illusion would be present. If the per- 
son who experiences it, however, puts forth his hand to 
grasp the flowers, he finds nothing that answers his touch. 
His visual experience is not consistent with his tactile ex- 
perience. The two parts do not fit together, and he, there- 
fore, judges, since the tactile experience is less often 
deceptive than is the visual, that he is subject to an illu- 
sion of vision.! Zhe test for an illusion, then, ts within the 
circle of individual experience ; the test for an hallucination, 
under ordinary circumstances, ts to be found not primarily 
within the individual's experience, but within the experience 
of the group. The test for both ts in terms of wider expert- 
ence, but the wider experience of the individual is not suffi- 
cient tf the individual does not conform to the social group. 
1 Macbeth saw the “air-drawn”’ dagger with the drops of blood, and was 
clearly the victim of an hallucination. He might have put forth his hand and 
touched the dagger, for it is quite possible for the abnormal person to expe- 
rience an hallucination that appeals to several senses at the same time. The 
test of the reality of Macbeth’s experience would be found in the fact that 
others would not have seen the dagger if they had been in the room with him, ©

  Nature of Perception in the Child QI 
In the last analysis, then, we find our criterion of a false 
perception one of adequate adjustment.. 
The relation of false perceptions to the learning process 
is an important one. The significance of hallu- two types 
cinations, however, belongs to abnormal psychol- f illusions. 
ogy, and, therefore, does not concern us here to any 
extent. With illusions, it is a different matter. 
Illusions, generally speaking, may arise from one of two causes, or 
from both together. An illusion may be due to an unusual set of con- 
ditions in connection with the object of the illusion, or to a strong sub- 
jective tendency, which leads to the interpretation of external conditions 
in terms of the subjective bias. As an illustration of an illusion of the’ 
first class may be cited the common laboratory experiment which con- 
sists in crossing the two middle fingers of the hand and then testing on 
the surface of these fingers, so crossed, the discrimination of distance 
between two compass points, one touching the first of the crossed fin- 
gers, and the other the second. If the subject of this experiment is 
blindfolded, or is in any way prevented from having a visual experience 
of the test, and an assistant manipulates the compass points, it will be 
found, almost invariably, that the shorter distances between the points 
are judged greater than the longer distances. This illusion is caused, 
as can readily be seen, by the fact that the crossing of the fingers has 
exactly reversed the ordinary conditions on which the discrimination of 
the compass points is based. An example of an illusion of the second 
type is to be found when a person is expecting a visit from a friend. 
Under such conditions persons, perhaps but slightly resembling in voice 
or appearance the friend expected, are perceived as that friend. It is 
obvious that in this second class of illusions we more nearly approach 
the hallucinatory perceptions discussed above. When this subjective 
tendency of interpretation reaches a sufficient degree of intensity, we 
may easily pass from the illusion to the hallucination. In the patholog- 
ical “ fixed idea” we have a case in point. 
It is with this second case of illusion that the learning 
process is most concerned. It may readily be seen that 
here we have an example of the aim of the con- Necessity of

it becomes the business of the person. who is directing 
his own learning processes or those of others to see to it 
that there exists the proper sort of expectancy; in other 
words, that the ideas and aims of the thought processes are 
such as can be actually realized in a world of concrete real- 
ity. It is at this point that illusion and imagination have 
much in common, though, as it will be insisted on in the 
following chapter, an imaginary experience is to be kept 
distinct from an illusory one. 
Methods of Lhe most obvious pedagogical applications 
instruction tg be deduced from the facts that have been must call : i 
forth activ- discussed in the last two chapters may be sum- 
eo marized as follows : — 
1. Since adjustment to the object of sensation is necessary 
to assure real experience and genuine learning, it follows 
that school methods must be more than merely passive in 
their character. They must call forth some activity on the 
part of the child. For this reason there is great danger, 
particularly in college and university work, of overemphasiz- 
ing the lecture method. To remedy this defect the quiz, 
the written recitation, free discussion, and laboratory methods 
should be introduced whenever possible. Inthe elementary 
school, where these methods cannot be used to so great an 
extent as in higher education, the pupil should be called 
upon to react in definite ways to the materials of instruction. 
If, for example, the teacher desires to acquaint the child 
with the distinction between various colors, it is not suffi- 
cient that he should simply present these and call the pupil’s 
attention to them. The pupil should be asked to match 
and compare them, to arrange them in the order of his 
preference, and so on. There are countless ways in which 
the child may actively express himself in his school work, 
1Tllusions are particularly likely to arise with school children, their 
strength decreasing with the age of the pupil. It is also true that imagination 
of acertain type, as will be pointed out later, loses its importance in tne child’s 
life as he grows older.
-P-A-G-E-117

  and the skilled teacher will be able to make the proper 
application of this principle of adjustment in all the sub- 
jects of the curriculum. 
2. The sensory experience which the child should obtain 
in his elementary school instruction must be integrated and. 
finally fitted into a system of meanings. The The experi- 
teacher should never rest with furnishing his fe of — . ° ° child mus

the very beginning, the facts that the pupils 
acquire should be grouped together in terms of their signifi- 
cance in relation to the subject matter as a whole.

follows that the learner must have the possibility of receiv-

rate diagnosis of eye and ear defects, rough tests of a 
preliminary nature can be made by the teacher or the school nurse. 
Tests for eye defects due to errors of refraction can be made with the 
ordinary Snellen cards. These cards should be placed in a good light, 
and the children should be tested singly, standing or sitting at some 
accurately measured distance (for example, twenty feet or six meters), 
from the test card. Each eye must be tested separately, as there is 
often a marked difference in the acuity of the two eyes. Ifthe child 
can read the line marked twenty at the distance of twenty feet, his acuity 
is expressed by the fraction 2? or 1; if, however, he can read no line 
above the one marked thirty, his acuity is 32, or two thirds normal. If 
there is but slight difference in his two eyes, and if they are not mark- 
edly subnormal, the errors of refraction are probably of slight conse- 
quence. However, a child who has but one half or one third vision in 
one or both of his eyes is under considerable strain when he is reading 
small print or copying from the blackboard at a distance. This strain 
may eventually work disaster, not merely to his eyes, but to his whole 
body as well. Allen says: “ Thousands of upper grade children and 
college students are dieting for stomach trouble that will last until the 
eyes are relieved of the undue and unrecognized strain.” In testing for 
astigmatism, Verhoeff’s astigmatic chart or some similar device is to be

used.1! Visual tests may also be made for muscular insufficiency (het 
erophoria), color blindness, discrimination of brightness, color dis- 
crimination, and the like. A simple test to determine auditory acuity 
may be made with the watch. Each ear is to be tested separately, and 
the watch is to be removed until the threshold of audibility is reached. 
The room in which the test is made must, of course, be quiet, and the 
child must further be tested to determine that he is not imagining that 
he hears the watch tick. This can be accomplished by covering the 
watch with the hand in such a way that the sound is deadened. If 
the child then asserts that he hears the ticking, it is evident that he is 
supplying the lack of sensation with his imagination. Auditory acuity 
may also be determined by the whisper test, by tuning forks, or with 
elaborate instruments such as Seashore’s audiometer or Lehmann’s 
acoumeter.?. If marked visual or auditory defects are discovered by 
any of the tests employed, the child should be examined by an oculist 
or aurist. Whenever a child is found that is particularly dull or stupid, ° 
the simple sensory tests for vision and hearing should at once be re- 
sorted to, as it is possible that the entire defect lies in these organs of 
sensation and is not more deeply seated.

as applicable to school conditions is found in Whipple’s “ Manual of Mental 
and Physical Tests,” pp. 128-187. 
2 All of the above tests are outlined by Whipple. Kirkpatrick, inthe Psycho- 
logical Clinic, III, pp. 96-97 (1909), gives a description of asimple whisper test 
for auditory-acuity that may easily be applied by the teacher under ordinary 
school conditions. As many as fifteen children may be tested at once, by 
placing five each in the two outside rows and the middle row of seats. The 
pupils are supplied with pencil and paper. The teacher, standing on the right 
opposite the middle pupil, pronounces ina low, distinct tone, and also in a low, 
distinct whisper, a series of numbers that they are required to write. After 
four or five numbers have been given in a low tone, and also a similar number 
in a whisper, the children change seats, and the test is continued. Standing at 
the left, opposite the middle pupil, the teacher repeats the test for the left ear. 
The record obtained shows the auditory acuity of each child as compared with 
that of his mates,

must take place on the plane of ideas. There are dangers 
of dwelling too long on concrete material. More and more 
the individual who is to be educated must acquire the 
capacity of passing from object to symbol; from the 
habitual adjustment to the interpretation of the environ- 
ment in terms of meaning.? 
There has been manifest recently, in certain quarters, a tendency 
to insist that all the instruction in the primary and grammar grades 
should be based on material of a concrete sensory character. With the 
younger children this insistence is, doubtless, wise. The child in the 
first grade may be taught to add and subtract by performing these 
operations with splints or blocks ; he may be made to comprehend 
the relative values of weights and measures by actually employing 
these; for example, he may learn that two pints equal one quart by 
pouring water into a quart vessel from a pint receptacle. It is, how- 
ever, nothing more than ridiculous to insist that this kind of instruction 
should be continued indefinitely. It is true that primitive man first 
learned to count by using his fingers, but he never could have arrived 
at any general notion of number relationships if he had remained in 
this first stage of concrete learning. When we are told that algebra 
should not bestaught in the higher grammar grades, because the pupil 
is thereby kept away from the concrete material that arithmetic affords, 
we must dissent. Whether the introduction of algebra into the grades 
is wise or not, its retention or elimination is not to be determined on 
the superficial basis of the opinion that the child is not ready to grasp 
the abstract and symbolic in the eighth grade. 
5. The meager, vague, and inaccurate perceptions pos- 
sessed by the child suggest the necessity of determining, 
as far as possible, systematically the range of a.) nag 
experience that each pupil has on entering the should be

means of those materials that are familiar to country 
children. The attempt that is now being made to link 
the elementary nature study with the rudiments of agri- 
culture has its chief economic value in the country school; 
on the other hand, the educational significance of this 
' material is perhaps greater for the city child than for the 
country child, since through this material the former is 
given a new perceptive basis. It should further be remem- 
bered that a knowledge of natural objects and phenomena 
is not sufficient material for education in the modern 
complex social environment. The country child in parti- 
cular should know something about industrial and social 
facts; have an acquaintance with machinery, and gain 
some knowledge of those activities with which the city 
child is familiar, but which are relatively uncommon in 
the rural life.

CHAPTER VII 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF IMAGINATION 
THE term “imagination ” in its popular sense often con: 
veys a different significance from that which it has when em. 
ployed in psychology.!' In everyday language se os ; ‘ Imagination it is not uncommonly used to describe an im- hota ca- 
practical state of mind given over to illusion Pricious act ; ; of fancy. 
and the contemplation of uncertainty. From 
this point of view the world of imagination is a realm of 
shadows divorced from contact with vital living and fruit 
ful thinking. Suchaconception as this is unfortunate, be- 
cause it is not true, and has caused no little confusion in 
the discussion of the desirability of imagination in the 
mental life of the child and the use of imagination as a 
means of ‘education. A very little reflection, however, 
should convince us that imagination (if we mean by it 
anything more than the wildest phantasies of the abnormal 
mind) has, even in its form of free productive creation, a 
very firm grasp on the real universe. 
What psychology means by imagination is quite simple. .

  Through other senses, also, there come other reports of the 
presence of the manuscript. I touch it; I hear the rustle 
of its pages; I recognize that it has weight when [I lift it, 
and soon. The knowledge that comes in this way through 
the direct presentation of an object to the senses, and the 
interpretation of that object in terms of past experience, 
is, as we have already seen, perception. Now, if I lay the 
manuscript on the table and shut my eyes, it is no longer 
present to the senses as an object, but it still may exist for 
me as a memory image. My mental state of perception is 
then changed to one of imagination. In this change there 
is no question of reality or unreality, of truth or delusion, 
but of immediate sensory presence, or the lack of such 
sensory presence. The object of my imagination has an 
external reality, and is not merely subjective and individual. 
When I imagine the manuscript I have not set into opera- 
tion a capricious, individual fancy. I refer the imagined 
manuscript to a world external to my passing, momentary 
thought, just as truly asI refer the perceived manuscript to 
this same external world. 
Various attempts have been made to define the mental 
image, and to distinguish it from sensation and perception. 
_ + The attempt to arrive at such a distinction by Imagination ; ; 
and percep- Classing the mental image as unreal and the 
“sig percept as real has invariably resulted in failure, 
guishedin and has no justification, as has‘ been shown 
er above, in experience.- A number of writers 
have attempted to distinguish between image 
and percept in terms of the functioning of the end organs 
and the nervous system. 
This is a favorite distinction, employed by many reputable authors. 
Miss Calkins,! for example, says: “ The physiological basis of imagina- 
tion differs from the physiological basis of perception, in the first place, 
by the lack of excitation of the peripheral end-organs, retina, taste- 
bulbs, and the rest.” Miss Calkins further states that “all elements of

the sensory image are centrally stimulated.” Stetson ! likewise defines 
the memory image as the appearance in consciousness under voluntary 
control of images without any sensory stimulus. James? says inasimilar 
vein, “In common cases of imagination it would seem more natural to 
suppose that the seat of the process is purely cerebral and that the 
sense organ is left out.” 
Granted for the moment that these and similar distinc- 
tions between imagination and perception, based on the 
activity of the end organs and cerebral centers, The impos- 
are valid, these distinctions are primarily of no Sibility of . determining

the nature of the conscious process ttself. There is no pos- 
sibility of determining directly just what physiological 
processes are occurring under such conditions. It is a dis- 
tinction in hypothetical physiological terms, and not in 
psychological terms. 
A more satisfactory attempt to define the mental image 
is from the standpoint of the experience as such. Fechner, 
more than half a century ago, in drawing a dis- 
tinction between a mental image and a visual eee | 
after image, described the former as indefinite, the mental 
washed out, and lacking corporeality. It pos- shrommh 
sesses no sharp boundaries, and is not easily introspective 
held in attention. The distinction in general or 
has been held by many psychologists, who seem to regard the 
mental image as a weak and indefinite sensation, differing 
from the actual sensation in degree rather than in quality. 
This, indeed, is the view of Wundt, who finds no absolute ground 
of distinction between image and sensation, and classes them both as 
the same kind of mental phenomena. Baldwin‘ says: “We are

aware in consciousness of no peculiar mark of revived states by which 
to distinguish them from percepts, except that they are prevailingly of 
less intensity. . . . If we try to recall the taste of an orange, we seem 
to have a kind of after taste of the orange.” 
Other writers, however, like Ziehen,! hold that there is 
a qualitative difference between image and sensation. 
“The idea of the sun is therefore by no means merely a faded sun. 
... It is not a difference’of intensity between the idea and the 
sensation, but above all a qualitative difference. The sensual vivacity 
characteristic of every sensation, does not belong at ai/ to the idea, not 
even in a diminished intensity.” 
Both of these views possess, doubtless, a certain psy- 
chological justification; yet both cannot be a correct in- 
trospective description of the nature of the mental image 
as distinguished from a sensation. It is true, as Wundt 
points out, that there are border line phenomena in which 
the distinction between the image and the sensation is at 
a vanishing point. Such states occur when the sensation 
is very weak or the image unusually vivid. On the other 
hand, it seems evident that ordinarily, in most sense 
departments, there is an actual qualitative difference be- 
tween the mental image of an object and a sensation of 
the same. 
For example, I cannot persuade myself that my mental image of 
middle C or of the taste of an orange is merely a weakened sensation 
of the musical sound or the taste of the fruit. In my ordinary 
experience, my mental image of these objects has so little likeness to 
the actual sensation that I can find no qualitative resemblance. On the 
other hand, my memory of the color violet is quite like my actual sensa- 
tion of it. It seems probable, then, that we have certain mental images, 
especially in the field of vision, that quite closely resemble the actual 
sensation in the same sense department; it also is apparently true that 
there are other experiences which pass for mental images that have little 
qualitative resemblance with their corresponding sensations. It would 
then seem impossible to define a mental image either as a, weak sensa- 
tion or as something sz7z generis.

General Characteristics of Imagination IOI 
The most serviceable description of the mental image is 
not to be found in defining it as a weak, hazy, and indefi- 
nitely localized sensation, although often it may Imagination 
take on this character, neither in defining it as defined. 
an absolutely unique experience, although at times (in- 
deed, perhaps, generally) it appears qualitatively different 
from the corresponding sensation. The definition which 
seems the most valuable, and which offers the least logical 
objections, while at the same time agreeing most closely 
with the verifiable facts of introspection, can best be 
stated in a functional way by defining zmagznation as that 
activity of consciousness in which an object of sensation ts 
experienced as not being immediately present to the senses. 
In other words, in order to have a genuine state of imag- 
ination there must be the direct experience of the object. 
not being actually before the senses. If this experience is 
lacking, there is no true imagination nor true mental image. 
This definition at once gives a clear distinction between 
imagination on the one hand, and perception, illusion, and 
hallucination on the other, a distinction which pis gegni- 
psychology has often failed to emphasize, which ion distin- 
failure has led to confusion and contradiction. es ra the

ence of the object, then the experience is a perception, 
true or false; if it is false, it must be classed as an illusion 
or hallucination, and never as an image. Whenever there

It does not matter if the individual recognizes the fact that he is de- 
ceived. He may know, for example, that the lake which he senses as 
on the horizon is not actually there; this knowledge does not do away 
with the illusory experience. Likewise the victim of an insane de- 
lusion may recognize the fact that his experience is false, but this again

does not remove the delusion. The mental image, on the other hand, © 
has in the moment of consciousness that quality by which it is at once 
recognized that its object is not directly present to the senses. It 
makes no difference what is the physiological correlate of this mental 
image; the origin of the experience is not the vitalthing. The signifi- 
cance of the experience as a conscious phenomenon is that which is 
important. Its value is determined by its meaning, not by its origin. 
If we inquire more definitely what is the meaning of the 
mental image as distinguished from the meaning of the 
percept, we are obliged to state thig distinction The differ- . 7 . enh be- in the difference of the type of reagtion aroused 
ican by the image from that aroused by the object of 
interpreted immediate sensory experience. On the whole,

experience is more direct, definite, and sustained. 
This is evident when we compare the difficulty of hold- 
ing in attention the object of imagination and the object 
of perception. But, on the other hand, while the reac- 
tion to the object of imagination 1s indefinite and incom- 
plete, the meaning which the image has is more complete 
and satisfactory than the meaning possessed by the per- 
cept. The image fits into my total purposes better; it has 
greater significance in my thinking; it is more amenable 
to the law of purpose, since it is farther removed from 
sensation; it is less fixed and does not come to me so 
clearly from without, and it finds its place more readily in 
the total flow of consciousness. Still, since its origin is in 
a sensory experience, the choice which I exercise in its 
selection is restricted. It cannot transcend all experience, 
and must ultimately conform to the sensations which give 
it birth. No mental image is a mere creation of the in- 
dividual mind. As has already been said, it is not entirely 
capricious and arbitrary. It has relations to a world of 
fixed realities, and, although its object can be manipulated 
with greater ease than the object of perception, yet, in so 
far as it has significance, it must ultimately accord with 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
    General Characteristics of Imagination 103 
the facts of an objective world. On the other hand, the 
object of perception must possess to a certain degree the 
characteristics of the image; it, too, must, in general, find 
' a place in the total flow of consciousness and be determined 
by the purposes of thought. At the two poles of experi- 
ence we have the object of sense and the image. The 
mere object of sense, as we have already seen, may be con- 
sidered as entirely without meaning, arbitrary, insistent, 
and present, whether we will it or not. It may come in at 
the most inopportune moment, as, for example, when a loud 
noise distracts our thought processes.. But we never have 
in normal consciousness a mere sensation; we have a per- 
ception, already partly tinged with meaning through previ- 
ous experience; neither do we havea pure image completely 
separated from a world of sensory experience. Zhe image 
7s not absolutely spontaneous, but must conform to an envt- 
ronment of hard facts tn which it finds tts validity and jus- 
tification. The image does not need to relate itself so 
directly and immediately to this objective world as does 
the percept; but the ultimate adjustment to such a world is 
necessary, if the image is to be justified. Fights of tmag- 
ination have value only in so far as they can somehow 
square with facts. Like perception, their truth or falsity 
is to be tested out in the way in which they work. The 
great difference is that in the instance of perception the 
adjustment is immediate; in imagination relatively remote. 
However, eventually both image and percept must justify 
their existence in a realm of actual, concrete living.

reaction is merely a postponement. The two worlds, the 
imagined and the real, are not finally two worlds. Eventu- 
ally the imagined must be realized and the ideal must be 
made a part of my concrete achievement.! 
— Jf imagination, then, is so fundamental a constituent of 
reality, how happens it that the widespread notion of 
Tere its unreal character should have arisen? The 
sons that  2Nswer is not far to seek. In the first place, 
have ledto imagination has been confused with illusion imagination “ 4 ‘ beingcon- and hallucination. These, as has been said, are 
ce false in so far as they assume an object present 
to the senses that does not exist. If imagina- 
tion is made identical with false perception, why, then, it 
naturally follows that it is unreal.) In the second place, 
simple imaginary elements, in themselves representatives 
of concrete realities, are capable of combinations that do 
not correspond to any actual or possible experience.) This 
complex of imaginative elements owes its existence to the 
so-called productive imagination, while to the recalling of 
single sensory experiences, not immediately present to the 
senses is given the name of reproductive imagination. 
Productive imagination may combine elements of- past 
sensory experience into products utterly fantastic and 
absurd. Our images of a horse and a man are results of 
a reproductive imagination essentially real; but when they 
combine into the picture of a centaur, they constitute a 
productive image to which our experience denies reality. 
It does not, however, follow that because these constitu- 
ents of the productive or creative imagination are unreal, 
all such images are. It would be a great mistake to 
assume that productive imagination as such were more 
unreal than perception. The test of the reality of any object, 
whether perceived or imagined, ts its agreement with the 
wider experience of the individual and of society. This is

pp. 158-168 (1908). 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    General Characteristics of Imagination 105 
essentially the criterion of adjustment referred to above. 
Why do I say, for example, that the centaur is unreal? 
Because I have never experienced such an animal, and 
because I believe no other being ever has or ever will. 
Surely the centaur is inherently no more fantastic than 
certain products of the imagination in whose reality I 
have the most firm belief. Let us take some of the 
almost contradictory animal forms of prehistoric times 
which the scientific imagination has constructed. Do we 
believe they really existed? We do, because they fit in 
with the extended experience of those scholars who from 
a few scattered remains, here and there, by a rare feat of 
productive imagination have reconstructed these animals. 
Without productive imagination the greatest literary works 
of the past, the constructions of inventors, and the hypoth- 
eses of men of science would never have come to pass. 
Accerding to the common doctrine, there are as many 
kinds or mental imagery as there are various sense depart- 
ments. Thus there are visual images, auditory eae 
images, tactile, temperature, and pain images, nary doc- 
images of taste and of smell, as well as images oe — 
of organic movements and of movements of joint, types inade- 
tendon, and muscle (kinesthetic imagery). It ate 
‘is, however, doubtful whether there are actual images 
without sensory accompaniments in any of the sense de- 
partments except vision and hearing, and even here, in 
many instances, what are termed visual and auditory 
images may have with them incipient sensations. When 
we turn to consider the images belonging to other depart- 
ments of sensation than vision or hearing, we find that 
their existence, apart from a direct sensory experience, is 
very doubtful. The recall of an olfactory or gustatory ex- 
perience without the aid of a present sensation is by no 
means established. In taste especially there are often 
present in the mouth actual gustatory stimuli that set up 
weak sensations and that may readily be taken for images.
-P-A-G-E-130
. often in- 
  106 The Learning Process 
Distilled water almost invariably gives the writer a bitter or a sour 
sensation, and in taste experiments with barely perceptible solutions, 
he finds it extremely difficult to judge whether these elements (bitter 
and sour) are actually present in the liquid tasted, or whether the taste 
is merely “in the mouth.” Generally olfactory images are quite want- 
ing, unless there are some actual odors present that serve as a basis 
for the recall. Titchener! has found that it is quite possible for him to 
recall various olfactory sensations while smoking a cigar, the odor of the 
tobacco furnishing a sensory basis for the revival. Slaughter? found 
that subjects who recalled certain tastes gave evidence of experiencing 
accompanying sensations in which movements of the tongue played an 
important part. With the attempt to recall salt there was a flow of 
saliva; with bitter, a puckering movement of the mouth and setting of 
the muscles, with the movement of the tongue and an organic reaction. 
Sweet and sour likewise caused tongue movements. Inthe attempt to 
recall ammonia, Slaughter’s subjects gave evidence of tension and feel- 
ing of irritation of the nostrils; while with alcohol, the breathing was 
a little irregular. In the case of dermal imagery it seems highly prob- 
able that the suggestion of the experience is sufficient to initiate actual 
sensations arising from the skin ; Slaughter concludes “ that the existence 
of dermal images in normal persons is extremely doubtful, and that the 
non-existence of the taste and smell images is practically certain.” 
There is no way of determining whether the so-called organic images 
(experiences arising from the internal organs) are not organic sensa- 
tions. Indeed, it seems extremely probable that in most instances the 
sensory element is the chief part of the experience. It is likewise prob- 
able that kinesthetic images are kinesthetic sensations. 
There is ground for believing, therefore, that the mental ' 
image must be regarded in many sense departments as 
he arising in connection with peripheral factors, 
images and that the mental image without these peri- 
aie pheral accompaniments perhaps exists only in 
peripheral vision and hearing. However, it makes little 
Shh difference if we hold strictly to our definition, 
namely, that a mental image is a state of consciousness in 
which an object of sensory experience is revived with the 
immediate knowledge that it is not present to the senses,

whether the so-called images are accompanied by totally 
or partly weak sensations. | 
If an image of bitter is suggested by a taste in the mouth, but is not 
experienced as a bitter object actually present to the senses, it is accord- 
ing to the above definition still an image, whatever its origin. If an 
image of a spoken word arises because of incipient sensations of move- 
ment in the vocal chords without the word being perceived as actually 
spoken, we have in terms of the above definition an image ; if an image _ 
of the color red is due in part or entirely to the physiological activity of 
the retina and is not accompanied by the impression that the red object 
is actually before the senses, there is no perception of the object, but 
rather an image of red. If we hold to this point of view throughout, 
then, we can maintain that there are images in connection with all 
sense departments. If, on the other hand, we define the image as an 
experience invariably arising without sensory accompaniments, it is 
probable that our imaginal experiences are extremely limited. 
A more important classification of images divides them 
into two main classes, namely, object-types and word-types.! 
To the object-types belong all concrete images gpject. 
of all sense departments, including motor types and word-types 
images in which the ideational processes are in of mental 
terms of imitative movements. Under the imagery. 
word-types are to be found verbal-visual, verbal-acoustic, 
and verbal tactile-kinzesthetic types. 
Examples of the various object-types are simple. The reinstatement 
of any concrete experience is in terms of the object-type. If 1 revive in 
imagination the appearance of a rose, I have a concrete visual image; 
if1 recall its odor, I have a concrete olfactory image;, if I recall the 
sensation of touching its petals, I have a concrete tactile image ; if I 
recall the prick of its thorns, I have a concrete pain image; if I recall 
the movement that I make in drawing my hands away from the thorns, 
I have a concrete motor or kinesthetic image. If, however, I do not 
recall the appearance of the rose, but merely its name, I have a verbal 
image ; if I recall the name as written or printed on a page, I havea 
verbal-visual image ; if I recall the name as spoken by some one, I have 
a verbal-acoustic image; if I recall the name in terms of the movements 
of my throat in speaking it, I have a verbal-motor image. Verbal-

-P-A-G-E-132
    108 | The Learning Process 
motor images may be of two kinds, namely, the verbal-motor images it 
connection with the organs of speech and the verbal-motor images in 
connection with the movements of the arms, hands, and fingers in writ- 
ing. The person who thinks of a word as he would write it has a verbal- 
motor image of the latter kind. Such images, however, do not normally 
arise without being accompanied by verbal speech-motor images. A 
simple test is sufficient to convince most persons of this fact. Attempt 
to spell a word merely by forming the letters with a pen or pencil, and 
you will find yourself, probably, either actually pronouncing the letters 
or reviving images involved in pronouncing them. 
The word-types of images, as can be readily seen, are 
symbolic; they stand for concrete realities, which, however, 
generally ave not vevived in connection with the symbol. 
I may, it is true, when I image the word “rose,” also 
think of the object for which it stands, but in most 
instances the revival of the concrete image with adults is 
not likely. 
Verbal or symbolic imagery is of the greatest importance 
in the more developed thought processes. It would be 
impossible to carry on the higher thought proc- Symbolic ; ey 
8 A esses without this symbolic imagery, and in the 
i Maher education of the child there must be a gradually 
thought. . increasing emphasis on the symbolic aspects of 
thought. Nevertheless, these symbols, if they have any 
ultimate validity, must in some way refer to the concrete 
image for which they stand. When we say that a discus- 
sion contains mere words, we often mean that the symbols 
that it uses refer to no concrete objects in a real world of 
experience. For many, doubtless, the only image con- 
nected with “infinity” is the mathematical symbol which 
represents it. Whole treatises have sometimes been 
written that seem to contain nothing but meaningless 
symbols. It is evident that whzle verbal imagery ts abso- 
lutely necessary in the learning process, still its abuse may 
be accompanied by very grave dangers. 
Besides speech-motor and hand-motor thinking, there is 
another type of verbal motor imagery that has been given
-P-A-G-E-133
    General Characteristics of Imagination 10g 
but slight attention in psychological literature, but which, 
nevertheless, is probably of a great deal of importance in 
the more abstract forms of thinking. This type 5. atic 
of verbal-motor imagery may be called dramatic or mimetic 
or mimetic. In thinking in this type of imagery “™#8°T% 
the person does not employ ‘‘inner-speech” (thought in 
speech-motor terms), but rather an inner sign language 
that carries the meaning often of abstract and colorless 
modesofthought. <A few illustrations may make clear what 
the general nature of this symbolic mimetic imagery is. 
When the writer attempts to call to mind a series of words, a phrase, 
or a paragraph, or even a collection of nonsense syllables, his first ex- 
perience in the recall is not generally the revival of the words as such, 
but rather the emergence in consciousness of the background or setting 
of these words in terms of their general “drift,” or meaning. There 
seems to be a certain rhythmical sequence in which these words appear ; 
an arrangement which is not spatial in its character in the sense that 
it represents the arrangements of the words on a printed page. It is 
rather a spatial arrangement in terms of the meaning of the thought 
processes. These meanings are represented by images of curves or 
zigzag movements, in which, often, there appears a sort of a plot, with 
a distinct rise to a climax, and perhaps a falling off at the end. This 
way of thinking comes out with great clearness for the writer when he 
is attempting to learn a series of nonsense syllables. If left to his own 
devices, he ‘finds himself invariably attempting to arrange these, even 
when he studies them in successive presentation, in a sort of a sequence 
of movements which seem essential to their subsequent recall. The 
actual “ mind-stuff ” of these thought processes he finds in images which 
represent gestures, such as pointing, raising the index finger, curving 
the hand, or in more general symbols of bodily movements which may 
involve a large variety of muscular adjustments. Such a sentence as 
this comes to the mind : “Infinity broods over all things.” Immedi- 
ately with the words themselves, arises in consciousness a general motor 
symbolism. The symbolism for the word for INFINITY is found in 
the tendency to prolong the word in imagination, this prolongation be- 
ing accompanied by the distinct impression of projecting the word from 
the mouth, and then following this projected word, as it seems to float 
on out into space, with the body. There is an image of a forcible and 
continued ejection by the speech-motor apparatus and a bending for- 
ward of the entire body, setting itself as if for flight. There is no visual   
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  110 The Learning Process 
symbol here, as, for example, of extended space or the limitless vault of 
the heavens on astarlit night. The whole suggestion of unending space 
comes as an image of motor adjustment. The word BRoops brings an 
entirely different suggestion. Here the ideation centers in a distinct 
picture (motor, not visual) of outstretched hands, with the body bend- 
‘ing forward and downward. ALL is symbolized bya sensation or image 
of roundness in the oral cavity; and by an extensive gesture (not actu- 
ally executed, but merely represented) of an inclusive movement with 
both hands sweeping around and joining in front of the body. The 
symbol for THINGS is the mental representation of a direct and sudden 
gesture, with hand extended and index finger pointing out and down- 
ward. | 
It may be noticed from this description that much of this mimetic 
thinking is in the stage of what would correspond in the development 
of word language to the period of ideographs, in which the word-symbol 
suggests the concrete situation for which it stands. This is particu- 
larly true of the imagery in connection with the word BRoops. On the 
other hand, INFINITY and THINGS are represented by imaginal elements 
in which the concrete has been almost entirely replaced by the 
symbolic. 
The fact is to be kept in mind, then, that besides speech- 
motor and hand-motor symbols, there are a large number 
laces of more general bodily movements that may be 
kinesthetic jmaged and which may symbolize concrete ob- 
syatbolices jects and situations, just as truly as the images 
actual of written and spoken words may represent the situations. ous ; . ° 
concrete realities which they symbolize. This 
general kinzesthetic or mimetic imagery stands for actual 
adjustments to concrete situations. This type of ideation 
is what we might naturally expect. It must be more prim- 
itive than that type which employs the images of words 
spoken or written as symbols. In an earlier part of our 
discussion, it was maintained that a completed experience 
arose first through a sensation to which there was some 
kind of reaction or adjustment; that a perception was 
more than a sensation or a group of revived sensations, 
and that it was fully set up only when completed by a 
reaction to the stimulus evoking the sensation. /¢ would, 
therefore, be entirely natural to suppose that these general
-P-A-G-E-135
General Characteristics of Imagination IIL 
  motor images are the symbols of actual concrete adjustment. 
They are, indeed, the images of a gesture language, a lan- 
guage earlier to appear and more simple than the word 
language. Thus mimetic images are the deepest and most 
subtle things in our thinking. This view falls in with 
the current biological theories in regard to consciousness, 
particularly with the Pragmatism of James and the In- 
strumentalism of Dewey. These theories have made us 
familiar with the thought that the meaning of a sttuation ts 
after all an attitude, and that an attitude must in the last 
analysts be a motor affair. Thus it ts but a step to the con- 
clusion that this general dependence of experience for its j 
significance on motor adjustments has left a deposit or “mind- 
stuff” that symbolically represents concrete situations, not 
actually present, but tdeally represented. This mind-stuff 
may in many instances have lost entirely its original sig- 
nificance. In other words, the situation is no longer re- 
instated in terms of an actual concrete adjustment, but 
rather in the terms of the motor symbol of that adjust- 
ment.! 
The above point of view has an important bearing on 
the question of imageless thinking that has recently been 
raised. A number of American and German Geperal 
investigators have maintained that the higher kinesthetic ‘ < ; imagery and 
thought processes proceed without any imaginal jmageless 
content whatsoever. On analyzing their ex- tousht. 
periences, when reasoning or judging, they do not find 
any trace of an imaginal background. If this is true, we 
have a separation between the higher and lower processes 
of intelligence ; a chasm which it seems difficult to bridge 
over. In the chapter on sensation it was maintained that 
our sensory experiences form the crude stuff from which 
all higher intellectual processes are constructed, and that 
sensation plus adjustment gives to the growing conscious-

ness of the child his first knowledge of a world of concrete 
objects. We have seen further how this primitive knowl- 
edge has developed into perception and has been revived 
through images coming from the various sense depart- 
ments, including those arising from the sensations of 
movement. J/¢ seems probable that the writers who have 
maintained that our higher thought processes are divorced 
Jrom all imaginal elements, and thus in the last analysts 
cut away from their sensory basis, have ignored to a large 
extent motor imagery, and particularly that type of motor 
wmagery which has been termed in this discussion mimetic 
symbolism. If it is true that a considerable part of our 
thinking is carried on with this motor background, the 
importance of this type of imagery in the learning proc- 
ess becomes apparent. Its significance in connection 
with rational thought will be discussed in a later section.! 
Miss Washburn ?” has arrived at a similar conclusion. She says, in 
discussing the “relational elements” of consciousness : “ The signifi- 
cance of these, it appears to me, is the following. They are the rem- 
nants of remote ancestral motor attitudes, and they resist analysis now 
because of their vestigial nature. Take the feeling of ‘but,’ for exam- 
ple ; the sense of contradiction between two ideas present when we say, 
‘I should like to do so, 6u¢— here is an objection.’ If we trace this 
back, what can it have been originally but the experience of primitive 
organisms called upon by simultaneous stimuli to make two incompat- 
ible reactions at once, and what can that experience have been but a 
certain suspended, baffled motor attitude. Similarly with the feeling 
of ‘if,),— ‘1 would like to do so and so, zf a certain condition favors.’ 
The primitive representative of this must have been the experience of an 
animal called upon to suspend all reaction until a defin.te added stimu- 
lus was given.” 
A number of investigations have been made during 
recent years concerning the development of imagination 
from childhood to maturity and the various types of im- 
agination employed by different individuals in their think-

ing processes. It was held at one time that individuals 
were of pronounced types in their ways of thinking. 
Studies of mental diseases seemed to emphasize aS 
the fact that certain persons thought in visual tine of - 
images almost exclusively, others in acoustic, idee : : ; J ypes no 
and still others in motor images. The doctrine as strictly 
of types, however, has more recently been, to a held to as ; formerly. 
considerable extent, abandoned. One of the 
most important discussions concerning the various types of 
imagery is that of Segal,! who maintains that the conclu- 
sions reached by Charcot and others as to the existence of 
sharply distinguished types of imagery are not altogether 
correct. 
Segal observes that not all those who possess intense visual imagery 
see all the words that they employ in thinking. Indeed, such a type of 
thinking is exceptional, and a person may, as Meumann has pointed out, 
for one purpose think in concrete visual imagery, while for another pur- 
pose he may™think equally well in acoustic or motor imagery. Indi- 
viduals apparently think visually concerning concrete objects, and in 
acoustic-motor terms when they employ words. For such reasons as 
these Segal concludes that the whole doctrine of distinct types is un- 
tenable and that the qualitative conception of types of imagery must be 
abandoned for a quantitative distinction. Most persons belong to a 
mixed type, and although they may possess greater vividness of imagery 
in one sense department than in others, they are not for this reason 
confined to one type of thinking. Further, it is not to be concluded 
because a person generally thinks in one kind of imagery that this is 
due to the fact that his imagery in that sense department is particularly 
vivid. It is evident that the majority of the perceptions which arouse 
our attention and are significant for us will be revived in that sense 
department to which they originally appealed. Segal further urges that 
a person may be visual for one kind of material and perhaps motor or 
acoustic for another, and, therefore, the type must be considered as 
relative to the material employed. Baldwin? remarks that for him 
“German is speech-motor and auditory, having been learned conversa- 
tionally in Germany, while the French which was acquired in school by 
reading and exercise writing is visual and hand-motor.” Similarly

Dodge? reported that though he generally thought in words and pro 
nounced these to himself, he at times thought in concrete visual imagery, 
as, for example, when he was planning a piece of apparatus. In this 
connection it may be said that in a series of experiments recently con. 
ducted in the psychological laboratory at the University of Illinois, it 
was discovered that the method of learning a list of words by one of the 
subjects observing varied according to whether the words were pre- 
sented in a regular or ina mixed order, in one instance the learner using 
visual images, in the other motor. Considerations like the above lead 
clearly to the conclusion that zz most cases there are no absolutely fixed 
types of imagery, but merely predominating types for certain classes of 
sensory or verbal material. 
Investigations that have been conducted concerning the 
development of types of imagery seem to have established 
Young chit- the fact that young children think largely in 
dren think concrete visual images, and that while auditory 
rea eee and motor imagery are present to some degree, 
visual they play a relatively unimportant réle in the 
magery* lower school grades. The child up to ten, at 
least, is predominantly a visualizer. Concrete visual, and 
probably all concrete imagery, tends to fall off in the more 
advanced grades, its place being taken by verbal imagery. 
There is a great loss in vividness in concrete imagery in 
the higher grades of the common schools. The importance 
of motor imagery, both of the hand and of the vocal organs, 
appears to be less than has generally been supposed, al- 
though children think in speech-motor terms much earlier 
than they do in hand-motor terms. The apparent growth 
in auditory imagery as the child advances in the school 
grades probably is indicative of the increase of the verbal 
type of imagery, and its development may show the growing 
tendency to thinking in terms of inner-speech.®

  _ General Characteristics of Imagination 115 
The education of the child has much to do in determin- 
ing the particular type of imagery which he generally uses, 
and it is no evidence that the child is devoid pe eauca- 
of a certain type of imagery, because he does tion of the . ° child has not think in such terms. Nevertheless, constant uch to do 
disuse of a certain type may completely destroy a wy y the effective use of that type. imagery. 
Francis Galton,! in his celebrated investigation concerning mental 
imagery; found that men of science are singularly lacking in all concrete 
imagery. On extending his inquiries more generally to persons of both 
sexes and various ages he found some possessed of extremely vivid vis- 
ual images, brightly illuminated, clearly outlined, and distinct and rich 
in coloring. That the men of science investigated by Galton did not 
possess such imagery was not due, probably, to any general difference in 
inherited ability, but merely to a difference in environment. However, 
while the average person is not strongly predisposed by heredity to any 
one particular type of imagery, there are cases in which heredity has played 
an important part. Men of genius have often possessed a very rich 
imagery ‘ofthe concrete type. Great artists have been reported with re- 
markable visual powers ; musicians, with unusual ability to recall melo- 
dies, and so on.

THE PEDAGOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMAGINATION 
As has already been pointed out, imagination is often 
confused with illusion and hallucination. Further, it must

vivid. these reasons the question of the value of imag- 
inative,materials in the life of the child has been seriously 
raised. \Thechild early in his life begins to combine past ex- 
periences into original mental products, and starts to weave 
a world of fancy that differs from the world of his ordinary 
experiences, sometimes in an astonishing ah The 
study of the imaginary companions of children has revealed 
the fact that these companions sometimes make their ap- 
pearance as early asthethird year. They are often themost 
vivid of realities ; they are distinctly visualized, have definite 
peculiarities, such as manner of dress and speech, and have 
well-marked moods and characteristics. They even con- 
verse with and aid those who have created them. Never- 
theless, if these companions are not actually confused with 
objectively existing personalities, they are still, according to 
the definition laid down in the preceding chapter, imaginary 
and not hallucinatory experiences. Imagination with the 
little child, however, may readily pass over into actual illu- 
sion or hallucination. Hall writes in this connection : — 
“In childhood credulity amounts almost to hypnotic suggestibility. 
Not only is everything believed, but the faintest hint starts the exuber- 
ant imagination to a vividness almost hallucinatory. This power to 
believe the false and even the absurd in infancy is not a defect, but ex- 
cess of psychic vitality. The narrow horizon of reality within the juve- 
nile ken is not enough, and the world of fancy and myth is needed ta

  supplement it. Never is receptivity so near to creative energy ; and this 
is why genius is defined as the preservation into mature years of the 
fecund mental spontaneity of childhood.” 
Much of the mental imagery of the child resembles the 
fancies of our myth-making forbears. The clouds and 
the stars, the sun and the moon, the raindrops 
and the snowflakes, and other elemental phe- (DOr? | 
nomena are often explained by children in a culty in dis- ; ‘ tinguishing way that suggests the poetic conceptions of petween the 
nature common to primitive peoples. For the oa 
child, the forest and stream, the field and foun- 
tain, are filled with conscious beings. Elves, pixes, goblins, 
fairies, and gnomes often seem as real to the child as 
parents, brothers and playmates. They form an essential 
part of his wider world. Since the knowledge of truth and 
falsehood, of reality and delusion, depends on experience 
in which the present is found to agree with the past or to 
contradict it, it clearly follows that in his early years the 
child has no definite criterion by which he can test his 
world of images and distinguish those which refer to the 
actual or possible from those which represent the fanciful 
and contradictory. Thus it happens that the child is in- 
capable of distinguishing between the possible objective 
reality of the most fantastic experiences and of those which 
can readily be realized in his daily life. Further, since the 
child is open to suggestion to a marked degree, his images 
may result in manifold illusions, such as come to grown-ups 
only in dreams, hypnosis, or pathological conditions. 
The hallucinatory character of the child’s experience often results in 
apparently intentional falsification on his part. Children’s lies not in- 
frequently arise from the fact that the child is incapable of separating 
the world of fancy and of fact. The tendency to fable-making causes 
him to make statements that are completely at variance with the truth 
as judged from the adult’s standpoint. Some years ago a teacher in the 
city of Boston asked the pupils under her charge to describe what they 
saw on their way to and from school. The result was, indeed, remark- 
able. The streets of Boston, from the reports of the children, resembled 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  8 | The Learning Process 
an African jungle or the country explored by Alice in Wonderland. It 
would be unfair to the children to describe their reports as lies, since 
these children had never had the issue of truth or falsehood presented 
in this connection. With young children intentional and deliberate 
falsehood is comparatively rare. , However, at an early age habits of 
untruth may be formed in a perfectly innocent manner that in later life 
may rise to a plane of ethical import. The question of the extent to 
which an exuberant childish fancy may be allowed to go, therefore, be- 
comes one of moral as well as intellectual significance. 
The fact, then, that children possess more than adults the 
creative imaginative faculty; that they distinguish only 
Pilate or slowly and by degrees | between the world of ° 
and ethical imagination and perception, and that they are so 
_ easily suggestible that an image may pass over 
imagination into a false perception, raises the question as to 
of children. the value of the imaginary world for the child 
and the proper attitude of education toward it. Should 
imagination be cultivated in children? And if so, in what 
direction should it be cultivated ; or should it be eliminated 
as soon as possible from the lives of the little ones, in 
order that they may better be prepared for the serious life 
which some day must come to them, if they survive the 
days of childhood and arrive at the development of adults? 
There are not a few who would be inclined toward this 
second alternative. Fact is fact, and there can be no com- 
promise between it and falsity. ‘So the teacher of history 
hastens to banish all such delusions as the existence of 
William Tell, and the instructor in science urges the un- 
reality of the nature myth and the fairy tale as explana- 
tions of events in a world of ordered phenomena. Like- 
wise, too, the professor of ethics may insist that truth is to 
be secured at all hazards, and that there can be no com- 
promise with falsehood. Hence Cinderella and Jack and 
the Beanstalk and even Santa Claus must go, for the child 
is to be made amoral being at all costs. Doubtless people 
of this turn of mind are not in the majority, and their num- 
bers are yearly growing less; however, they are still heard
-P-A-G-E-143
    \ 
The Pedagogical Significance of Imagination 119 
protesting against the mass of myth and fairy tales that of 
late years have been especially prepared for the instruction 
and entertainment of the child. Their point of view de- 
serves consideration and an intelligent answer. 
What reply can we frame to the objection that myth is 
intellectually and morally wrong because it is not true? 
Our answer to this view of the case will be aided tye nature 
if we consider again the position which we have of truth. 
previously set forth, namely, that reality and truth depend 
on the agreement of our present experience with our total 
experience and the experience of others. That which best 
fits into experience, which most untformly satisfies the 
intelligence, 1s the truth; and since experience must ever 
change, there ts no truth that is absolute and that will stand 
the test of the ages. 
For later antiquity and the middle ages the system of the universe 
evolved by the Greek-Egyptian astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy, was true 
because it fitted the then known facts; yet the wider experience of a 
later age made this view unsatisfactory, and the Ptolemaic system gave 
way to the Copernican; but who will be so rash as to affirm that the 
latter gives a final point of view? The individualism of the eighteenth 
century proved a sufficient philosophy for Rousseau and the doctri- 
naires of the French Revolution; it satisfied the framers of our own 
Declaration of Independence, but to-day it is giving way to a theory 
of social dependence that cannot find truth and satisfaction in what was 
once accepted as an ultimate statement of the nature of man. So, too, 
the mechanical atomism of the science of yesterday is no longer able to 
hold its place in the newer conception of the physics of to-day. We 
need not multiply examples. On all sides we see a significance in the 
statement now so often heard that a thing is true as long as it proves 
satisfactory and no longer, and that the quest for ultimate truth is an 
unending quest; the search for a goal that always recedes; a journey 
toward the rim of the horizon whose mystic borders we can never 
attain. So myth which satisfies the intellectual and moral needs of the 
savage is true for him, but false for us; just as our science will be false 
for some future generation; so the fairy tale of the child, which for him 
offers the most reasonable explanation of the world, is far more true 
Jor him than our adult conception could possibly be. Some day he will 
be an adult and will have put away childish things, but as long as he 
remains a child, he must think as a child, if he thinks at all. As his
-P-A-G-E-144
  120 The Learning Process 
experiences extend, he will slowly cast aside the fancies of an earlier 
day, now grown inadequate, but not so suddenly that there will be a 
jar or a break in the continuity of his reality. Think as I may, I can- 
not tell when Santa Claus became for me a reality of another order than 
that which my earlier imaginings had made the venerable saint. When 
I first learned that he had no place in this dull, prosaic world, I cannot 
remember. I am sure, however, that the change was not in the twink- 
ling of an eye. Newtruths come like the dawn, — first the pale auroral 
tints that brighten and broaden, and before which the stars and moon 
gradually grow dim and finally pass from view. But the stars and the 
moon lit the night and made the path clear. 
The myth-making period of childish imagination 1s neces- 
sary because it satisfies the childish conception of the world, 
and 1s, therefore, the true conception for him. ‘This is the 
only measure of its value. If the fancies of the child 
become so unreal and extravagant as to place him out of 
harmony with his childish environment, then they are dan- 
gerous and valueless for him. 
It must not, however, be supposed that the creative fancy 
of children has no value beyond the early years of develop- 
ment. Child study teaches us one fact at least The value : ° . : 
of fancy in With sufficient certainty, and that is that each 
i a stage of development is necessary for that which 
| follows. Just as the gill slits in the human 
embryo, those worse than useless appendages for the child 
in his post-natal existence, serve a very necessary purpose 
in contributing to organs yet to be formed, so the mytho- 
peeic fancy of childhood enters into the adult experience in 
many subtle ways and enriches the life of the man. The 
fairy story of childhood still counts in the healthful fancy 
of grown-ups. Can we enter into sympathy with the great- 
est imaginative writers of the ages, if our early training 
has found no place for Grimm and Andersen, and others 
of the noble company of myth-makers? The language 
that Homer and Virgil and Spenser and Shakespeare and 
Dante and scores of others of the past have spoken is 
jargon to him who has no understanding of the simpler
-P-A-G-E-145
    The Pedagogical Significance of Imagination 121 
obscure and forgotten masters, who in the folklore of the 
people of all times have left a world of rarest story for 
the children of ages yet unborn. In this humdrum 
world of ours, how the heart yearns for these oases of 
fancy in the desert of the real! But to drink from the 
sparkling waters is a privilege given only to those who 
have discovered the hidden fountains in the days of 
childish simplicity. A boy of nine who has outgrown his 
implicit faith in fairy tales, but who still finds in them a 
satisfaction for his emotional life, often says, “I wish they 
were true; I wish that when you opened your mouth, gold 
would fall out of it. Wouldn’t it be fineif just by thinking 
you could make castles rise in the air? Hownice it would 
be if there were real giants that brave boys could kill and 
beautiful princesses who could be rescued from wicked 
witches and watchful dragons!” I must confess that I 
sympathize with the youngster, and: I am not ashamed 
that I still have a love for the fairy tale and the super- 
natural; but this sympathy and love could not exist if at 
one time these tales had not been for me a genuine 
Weltanschauung ; if they had not constituted for me a 
realm of reality more satisfactory, and as sufficient as my 
present view of the universe. So when some child on 
hearing a story of wonder asks, half believing, half doubt- 
ing, “Is it true?” I cannot with a clear conscience reply 
“no”; for it is true in a sense which the little questioner 
does not comprehend. Indeed, as a mere intellectual 
proposition I am not at all convinced but that the myth 
world of the child and primitive man does not more exactly 
correspond to ultimate realities, than the mechanical uni- 
verse of the materialist filled with whirling atoms, but 
without purpose or design.! 
As a corollary to the proposition that the creative fancy 
of the child is valuable as long as it adequately satisfies

  122 The Learning Process 
the child’s needs comes the equally true statement that 
when these fancies have become inadequate they should

fancies outgrown his primitive ideas, he must be given should not ‘ : .

haps little danger of violating this important principle; 
however, 72 the religious education of the child the mistake 
an often made of keeping him in a world of the mysterious 
and impossible when his intellect cannot give assent to the 
miraculous and the supernatural,. The result is that when 
the older child is instructed in those materials of religious 
education which were quite adequate for his simpler 
comprehension, he rebels against them, and, doubting the 
validity of these, questions the value of religion as a 
whole. Many tragedies in the religious life of children 
have arisen in this manner. 
It should further be kept in mind, as has already been 
said, that while a part of the child’s early life is properly 
Certain given over to myth and fancy, a considerable 
facts that part of it must be within a circle of exactness 
oad and definiteness that cannot be departed from 
exactly. without serious danger. Primitive man, like 
the child, was a myth-maker. He dwelt in a world filled 
with supernatural beings ; nevertheless, there were certain 
things that he was compelled to know exactly and accu- 
rately, if he were to survive in his desperate struggle for 
existence. He might believe that a mysterious god moved 
in the frightful tempest, spoke in its thunders, and revealed 
himself in his wrath in the flashes of lightning. But this 
same savage must know definitely how to make his spear 
and hurl it with accuracy against the savage beast or his 
more savage human enemy, if he were to survive. There 
could be no fancy, no myth-making here. So it is with 
the child. A large number of things he must know 
definitely and certainly, particularly those that relate to F

The Pedagogical Significance of Imagination 123 
the ordinary subjects of instruction in the schools. There 
can be no supernaturalism about the multiplication table; 
‘myth should not enter into his spelling exercises. Fancy will 
not help in geography and nature study. For this reason 
it is to be doubted if those delightful animal books which 
have appeared in recent years and which give all sorts 
of charming but absurd attributes to real and mythical 
animals are not a positive danger in accurate knowledge. 
It is a fortunate thing, perhaps, that even with the child, 
the mind is, to a certain extent, built on the compartment. 
plan. So zt zs possible to instruct the child accurately in 
one branch of knowledge and still to leave him a con- 
siderable play of fancy in others. It is the business of the 
educator to draw the line between those fields of instruc- 
tion which permit flights of imagination and those that 
do not. No absolute rule can be laid down, and it must 
be left largely to the common sense of the individual 
teacher to make the division. It must always be kept 
in mind, however, that while it is absolutely necessary 
for the highest enjoyment of the child and for his future 
development to have a vivid creative imagination, on the 
other hand, it is equally as necessary that he should con- 
form also to a world of solid and definite facts, with which 
he must count, if he is to succeed either in the mimic 
world of his school environment or in the broader activities 
of later life. 
In discussing the various types of imagination as they 
appear from childhood to maturity, the fact was pointed 
out that young children think particularly ah i eae 
concrete imagery, in most cases largely visual, importance 
while later on they develop verbal imagery pane 
largely of the speech-motor type, in which they verbal 
do their thinking. In connection with this fact “"*8*" 
there arises the important educational problem of the rela- 
tive value of these two types and the proper emphasis 
that should be given them at various stages of development. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  124 The Learning Process 
Concrete visual imagery gives a vividness and objectivity 
to the thought processes of the little child which are en- 
tirely wanting in the life of the adult. At the same time 
this concreteness is, to an extent, incompatible with the 
more developed forms of thinking. It, therefore, is neces- 
sary to accustom the child to the use of verbal imagery. 
This the school does to such an extent that there is a 
gradual devitalization of the imaginal elements in the 
consciousness of the child. The gain in abstract thinking 
is of course incalculable, but the loss in vividness is a real 
one. It is specially important, if the child is to understand 
and enter into sympathy with various forms of artistic ex- 
pression, that he should be able to revive his concrete 
imagery whenever necessary. Some ofthe finest passages 
in English literature in narrative and descriptive prose and 
poetry have lost their real significance for the pupil of high 
school age, simply because they call up, not the living im- /~ 
ages of the scenes and events which they describe, but 
mere symbols that have no genuine significance in the in- 
terpretation of the piece of literature that is being studied. 
As has already been said, the type of imagery which a per- 
son possesses is perhaps not so much a matter of inherit- 
ance as of training, and there seems to be no good reason 
why both types of imagery, the concrete and the verbal, 
should not be cultivated at the same time. There are cer- 
tain studies in the school curriculum that are particularly 
well suited to cultivate concrete imagery, and others to 
stimulate the symbolic types. Among the former may be 
mentioned literature, when taught in the proper manner, 
nature study, geography, and, to an extent, history. Mathe- 
matical studies, grammar, and the like, encourage the de- 
velopment of the latter type. It is the business of the 
teacher to insist in the proper place that the various school 
subjects shall be so studied that they shall stimulate the 
growth of bothofthesetypes. Thefactthattheconcrete vis- 
ual imagination predominates over both auditory and motor
-P-A-G-E-149
  The Pedagogical Significance of Imagination 125 
imagination may be in part due to the native superiority of 
the first-named type, but is very likely to a considerable 
extent to be explained by the fact that the course of in- 
struction in the school tends from the very outset to 
emphasize the printed page. 
Here again in instruction in literature it should be 
- remembered that the proper interpretation of the greatest

motor elements as it does on visual. Chz/dren preciation

often done in a slipshod manner. The teacher of literature, 
too, is often unskilled in interpretation, and so it happens 
that many of the finest pieces of prose and poetry make 
appeal to the eye alone. This is all the more unfortunate 
when we remember that the earliest forms of the communi- 
cation of literary masterpieces were oral and dramatic. 
The superintendent, in choosing a teacher of English for 
the high school, ought to insist, not merely on a knowledge 
of philology and on critical ability, but also on power to 
interpret and express the thought. Teachers of literature 
often emphasize a mere word-cram and mechanical memori- 
zation. Through this they aim to get definiteness and 
concreteness in the work of the pupil; they, however, 
lack definiteness as to their own aims in teaching litera- 
ture, and in the end they succeed only in creating a dis- 
gust on the part of the pupils for the literature that they 
udy.     
                   
   
    Recently in school instruction story-telling has found a prominent 
place in the earlier grades, and there is an increasing tendency to give 
value to the dramatization of literary masterpieces. This tendency is 
certainly in the right direction, if it is not overemphasized. It is, how- 
ever, necessary to remember that there are certain fundamental ele- 
ments in the school work that cannot be ignored, and the attempt to 
enrich the course of study and to develop the various aspects of 
imagination should never be at the expense of minimizing the value 
of those elements which make up the rudiments of education.
-P-A-G-E-150
  126 The Learning Process 
The importance of kinzsthetic or motor imagery in the 
thought processes suggests that it may be cultivated to 
oo advantage. Education has recognized in man- 
portance of Ual training, sewing, and studies of a similar 
oot nature the desirability of developing concrete 
kinesthetic imagery of a certain type. Such 
studies, however, cultivate kinzesthetic imagery only in one 
direction. A person may be skillful with his hands to an 
extraordinary degree, and yet have no power of expression 
in the use of words and be entirely lacking in general 
-dramatic ability. The symbolic mimetic imagery which 
we have discussed earlier seems to be much more closely 
connected with dramatic interpretation than it does with 
mechanical skill. To cultivate this latter form of imagina- 
tion we cannot rely upon manual training and studies of a 
like nature, but we must appeal to the dramatic instinct 
more directly and seek to interpret pieces of literature and 
the like through drawing the pupil’s attention to the mean- 
ing of this literature in terms of action. 
In conclusion it may safely be said that the greater the 
amount and variety of imagery at the disposal of a person, 
the richer and more valuable his thought proc- All types : o Lae 
ofimagery esses. Nevertheless, a high degree of speciali- 
Show bs zation may demand the limiting of the effective 
imagery used by the individual to one particular 
type. As previously stated, Galton found men of science 
to be practically without concrete imagery of any sort. lz 
the common schools, however, there should be no such thing 
as specialization, and a broad basis should be laid so that to 
_ the pupil shall be opened up that avenue of life along which 
he may journey with the greatest profit to himself and value 
to the community. No child should graduate from the 
common schools with his ability to imagine in concrete 
forms devitalized. He should have it in his power to 
revive visual experiences in as intense a manner as when 
he entered the primary grade. If he possesses a natural
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Pedagogical Significance of Imagination 127 
disposition, his auditory imagery should still be vivid, and 
the dramatic instinct which he showed normally in his 
childish plays should not have vanished. At the same 
time he should have acquired the power to think symboli- 
cally, and should have at his command hand-motor, speech- 
motor, and general kinesthetic imagery. It is doubtful if 
specialization should come even during the high school 
course to any great extent; but there should be develop- 
ment in the pupil’s ability to use symbolic imagery, and at 
the same time a growth in the keenness of his powers to 
bring into existence through imagination the concrete 
experiences of daily life.

nomenon. In a certain sense such modification may be 
lookedonasmemory. Asafundamental biological phenom- 
enon, memory signifies the modification of an organism by 
contact with its environment. In this way it lies at the very 
basis of the learning process, which has been described in 
its most general terms as the modification of the reactions 
of an organism through experience. 
This view that memory is a general characteristic of all organic 
material has been emphasized by various writers from time to time. 
It has been pointed out that those causes which act. upon matter leave 
behind them dispositions or tendencies because of which a recurrence 
of the phenomena aroused by these causes is more probable with each 
succeeding repetition. The latest and most systematic attempt to de- 
scribe memory as an underlying principle of organic life has been made 
by Semon.! Such a general point of view as this is, however, not par- 
ticularly serviceable in the discussion of memory as an essential element 
in the learning process. 
In a narrower sense of the word, memory as a conscious 
phenomenon signifies the modification of present experiences 
hey a in terms of past experiences. An example of this 
aconscious Modification is found in perception. The object 
penne which I recognize is something more than the 
mere sensation of it, because of the experiences 
that I have already had with it.

  For example, I see before me a round object of a certain size and 
color. This visual stimulus I interpret, and I recognize a ball. In 
connection with this experience of the ball there are involved many 
past experiences, such as lifting it and throwing it and catching it. In~ 
a sense, then, my present experience is in part due to memories of past 
experiences ; yet these memories may not be revived in any distinct 
sense. I may not even have images of these past experiences clearly 
in my mind. Still the object which I see before me is an object con- 
stituted by past experience that has left its traces somewhere, and these 
function in my interpretation of the visual stimulus before me. 
We can restrict our definition of memory still more, and 
identify it with reproductive imagination. This is Miss 
Calkins’s? point of view in her most recent work. yemory as 
She says, “ Relatively accurate and complete reproductive “ 
reproductive imagination is called memory.’ This #88 me 
definition would seem to imply that if, for example, I see 
an orange, and there arises in connection with the visual 
sensation an image of the taste of the fruit, I have a mem- 
ory of the taste. Reproductive imagination then functions 
for the modification of the present experience in terms of 
the past, while productive imagination, as Miss Calkins 
points out, functions for the extension of experience into 
the future. 
She says, “ By reproductive imagination or memory I hold the past ; 
and in creative imagination I reach out also beyond the limits of past 
and present. Asa merely perceiving self I am bound to this desk, this 
room, this plot of ground; but as a remembering self I live through 
once more, the exhilarating adventures and the beautiful scenes of my 
past experience, and as a creatively imagining self I am hampered 
neither by ‘now’ nor by ‘then.’ I go beyond my own actual experience. 
I see visions, I dream dreams, I create new forms.” Miss Calkins 
goes as faras to say “that all thoughts are based_on_memory.” She 
adds, “I could not be conscious of chairs as a class, if I could not re- 
member different sorts of chairs which I have seen; and I could not 
reason . . . if I could not remember the values, once learned, of the 
different terms.” It will be seen from the above discussion that Miss 
Calkins considers all images and ideas that arise through past experience 
as memories.

Memory may be defined ina still narrower sense. James

necessarily constitute a personal memory. When I see an

‘may not, recollect definitely that I have experienced that 
taste before. 
If I do not have the definite recollection of a previous 
experience, then, according to James, I have no memory of 
the taste. If, however, we accept Miss Calkins’s The views ° : . ; ‘ of James  POint of view and make memory identical with 
and Calkins reproductive imagination, then, even some of contrasted. ; Ss! ; 
the earliest experiences of our childhood that 
we cannot recall as individual experiences may appear as 
memory images. Ordinarily, however, we understand by 
memory what James implies in his definition ; namely, the 
revival of a past experience with the definite knowledge that 
this experience belongs to the past. This restricted definition 
of memory is perhaps too narrow for us to consider ex- 
clusively in discussing the learning process, since a large 
number of experiences which function in the present mo- 
ment are never recalled definitely as past experiences ; 
nevertheless, they are most important in learning. 
When we speak of the revival of a past experience as 
the essential characteristic of memory, we must remember 
Anexperi- that an experience can never be revived in all 
ence never its details, and that the memory of it is not the revived in ° ‘ allitsde-  Merereinstatement of the past. There is always 
tails. something lacking in the memory, and there is 
always a difference in quality as well as in quantity. We 
must forever dispense with the naive notion that the mind 
contains somewhere a storehouse in which the past is 
deposited and from which the past can be brought up

unaltered. Images and ideas cannot be thought of as 
floating in and out,of consciousness and maintaining an 
existence as conscious elements during the intervals in 
which they areforgotten. Memory must be rather considered 
as the functioning of present experience in such a way that 
zt revives the past without actually reinstating that which 
in one sense has departed forever. 
It must further be borne in mind that to have an actual 
memory, time must have elapsed between the original 
experience and the revival, and that during this;y, ious 
interval the past experience has dropped out of degrees of . 
consciousness. If, further, we accept James’sy7 
definition of memory, we must recognize that the accom- 
panying consciousness of an experience as past may range 
from a mere sense of familiarity to a detailed recollection 
in which events are put in their temporal setting and 
related definitely. It is doubtful if animals or young 
children ever have this latter sort of memory. 
Hall describes, in his charming style, his experiences on revisiting 
the home of his childhood and the various familiar scenes of his early 
environment.! His earliest memories of the objects which he saw 
about him are of the vague reminiscent type, characteristic of child- 
hood. In one place he says, “ Often, as, ¢.¢. while gazing eastward toward 
a dense swampy forest, where even yet an occasional bear or deer is 
killed in winter, or when coming upon cherry trees near a ledge, or 
visiting rocks beside which were two old maples, a feeling that I thought 
to be a glint of vague familiarity was experienced. On coming to a 
knoll upon a vast heap of stones near trees, I found myself articulating 
‘Why! yes, of course, there was something like that.?... ‘The 
sudden smell of catnip, the gloominess of an old wall of black stones, 
a deep well beneath the kitchen, the abundant and peculiar moss on the 
ledges, were other things that brought a distinct sense of familiarity, 
but no trace of anything like memory. A deep wild gorge to the 
west of the level road, although quite hidden from it; the stumps of 
three old maples on the east some distance from the house; the slight 
slope of the front yard and that of a neighbor’s, with a wellhouse,

  $32. The Learning Process 
vaguely suggest reminiscence, but it is more a feeling of a strong and 
peculiar interest than any identification with past experience.” 
In the discussion it is clear that Hall means by memory reminiscence 
in the sense in which James uses the term. In another place he says, 
“So with the rocky end of a knoll comes an almost imperative associa- 
tion of cows being milked by a woman.” This, however, was not a 
distinct memory in the sense in which Hall uses the term, but rather 
an aroused image which might refer or not to some particular past ‘ 
experience. In the sense in which Miss Calkins uses the term, this 
latter revived experience should be given the name of memory, although 
no definite recollections are connected with the image. Examples of 
more definite memories are found in Hall’s account in such descriptions 
as the following: ‘“ Yes, there was a tree here, a nutting place, a cow path, 
blackberries, a curious stone there, this was the old door hook which it is 
a certain pleasure to rescue from entire forgetfulness, the same old stone 
wall half torn away remains.” Dr. Hall also cites memories of vague, 
shadowy fears that were revived through the sight of the objects which 
originally excited them. He says, “Several times, first on a dark, 
stormy, windy night, and last on a bright moonlit one, I undertook to 
wander through the village graveyard. . . . As I approached it, there 
was a depressing sense of loneliness, which darkened down to a strange 
kind of fear. I found myself tense, anxious, expectant of something 
painful before these apprehensions took any form or had any object. Then 
I thought of ghosts and kindred wild scenery, that made me always, as 
a boy, run by this place after dark. As I forced myself to climb over 
the black fence under the pines and to touch a few of the nearest grave- 
stones, the nervous awfulness of it all increased.’’ Hall concludes that 
memories before the dawn of adolescence are vague and incoherent. 
“Coherent and sequent memory does not begin until the child has 
reached the age of puberty.” 
In discussing the nature of memory we should make a 
careful distinction between recognition and recollection. 
To recognize an object merely implies that we Recognition ; dee ik i 
andrecol- react to it with a degree of familiarity, but it 
lection dis- does not imply that we recall definitely where we tinguished. : 8 . . ; 
have previously had experience with this object. 
Recollection, on the other hand, involves, to a greater or 
less degree, recalling the experience or event in its original 
setting. We may, for example, recognize the clang of the 
trolley bell, but this does not necessarily imply that we
-P-A-G-E-157
  Memory / Spee 
recollect any previous occasion on which we have heard it. 
It further should be borne in mind that recognition does not 
necessarily involve imagination. On purely a@ prior. 
grounds it has been held by many writers that recognition 
involves a memory image in connection with the object rec- 
ognized. An examination of one’s consciousness during 
recognition does not by any means substantiate such a belief. 
I may, it is true, recognize the face of a friend, recalling in 
imagination previous occasions on which I have seen my 
friend. On the other hand, I may hear the clang of the 
trolley bell, and identify it accurately, yet I may be incapable 
of experiencing an auditory image, and may never be able in 
the slightest degree to recall the sound as an element in my 
past experience. Most of us have not the slightest diffi- 
culty in recognizing our acquaintances by their voices ; yet 
it is probable that a large number, perhaps the majority of 
individuals, do not possess the ability to revive in imagin- 
ation the distinctive quality of these voices. Recognition 
merely implies that we react toward an object of past expert- 
ence.in an habitual manner. Many animals are capable of 
recognition in this sense of the word ; tt ts to be doubted, how- 
ever, if any but the very highest have the ability to recollect. 
The story is told that-Odysseus,*on his return from his wanderings 
after leaving Troy, was recognized at his home-coming by his faithful 
dog alone. It is not to be supposed, however, that the animal actually 
identified his master; the action was merely spontaneous and habitual, 
and the accompanying mental state could have been nothing more than 
a vague feeling of familiarity. |

the level of the subconscious, but, nevertheless, whatever mental ac- 
companiment there is of my action is to be characterized as the recog 
nition of the rose. I may, however, in my walk come upon a flower 
which I do not readily and subconsciously recognize, and to which, 
therefore, I do not react in the same habitual way as I did in the case 
of the rose. I may hesitate to pick the flower until I have identified it. 
In this event there will probably arise in my mind memory images of 
flowers of a similar nature, and the process may continue until I have 
identified this particular flower in terms of previous experience and 
through the aid of a memory image. We will see in a later discussion 
that such a mental process issues in what is termed a judgment on the 
subjective side and in a definite reaction on! the objective side. earning Process 
t The two basal elements in memory are impression and 
association. Impression can perhaps be treated best on 
Impression the physiological side, and is to be thought of as 
bye wes: that capacity in the nervous system for receiv- 
: ing and retaining experiences. Association, on 
the other hand, is best explained in terms of consciousness, 
and relates to the manner in which the elements in mem- 
ory are linked together so that they may be subsequently 
recalled. Manifestly, the first factor in memory is not to 
any large degree amenable to the learning process; while 
the second element is modified and controlled by learning. 
James in his chapter on “ Memory” distinguishes between 
desultory and systematic memory, making the former de- 
pend almost entirely upon the ability of the nervous system 
to receive and retain impressions, and the latter upon the 
ability of consciousness to join together in helpful ways the 
materials already deposited through past experience. James 
considers impressionability a matter predetermined through 
the inherited nature of the nervous system; therefore, ac- 
cording to his point of view, desultory memory cannot be 
improved. It is only systematic memory that can be edu- 
cated. Some writers have identified memory on the side 
of impression with a purely physiological activity, and 
have termed the product of such memory, a memory 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
           
   
       
           Memory 13 
after-image. In using this term they have had in mind 
the analogy of the purely physiological after-image, which 
appears as a continuance of the stimulation of an end or- 
gan after the stimulus has been removed. 
For example, if we look for some time at a yellow disc of paper, and 
then turn our gaze away to a neutral gray background, we will see ap- 
pearing on that background the form of the disc that we have been look- 
ing at, but colored blue, the complement of the yellow of the stimulus. 
This effect is to be explained by the fact that after the stimulus of the 
yellow disc has ceased to affect the eye, still there is a continuation of 
the chemical processes set up in the retina by the original stimulus. In 
somewhat the same way, the impression of the object of memory is 
thought to continue and be revived without any other reason than the 
purely physiological activity due to a modification of the nervous sub- 
stance through the experience recalled in memory. 
There seems to be some doubt, however, as to whether 
we can have any recall whatsoever, without a certain 
amount of association. There have been dis- ; ‘ . ‘ Can recall 
cussions pro and con concerning this question. take place 
Those who hold to the possibility of such recall without | . - association ? 
point to the fact that things and events of past 
experience often come into the mind with apparently no 
reason in the flow of consciousness and the associations 
present in consciousness for their appearance. Certain 
bits of experience have the tendency to persist or per- 
severe! and to come up from time to time in a haphaz- 
ard sort of a way. Indeed, they sometimes come up in 
spite of our conscious associations, in a most provoking man- 
ner. Most of us are, doubtless, familiar with Mark Twain’s 
story of the senseless jingle, “A blue trip slip for a te 
cent fare,” etc., which persisted in the most provoking w 
and with the most disastrous consequences in the consciv

verance.” Myers, ‘“ Text Book of Psychology,” p. 144 (London,

ness of those who had once learned it. Those who do not 
believe that it is possible for the bare memory image with- 
out associative links to intrude itself upon consciousness, 
maintain that these seemingly irrelevant and disjointed 
memory fragments do not occur without some reason. This 
reason is probably to be found in subconscious associations, 
which have worked themselves out in a perfectly definite 
way, though unknown to the person in whose mind they 
have been forming. That such subconscious associations 
seem probable is indicated in the investigations and theo- 
ries of many workers in mental diseases and in abnormal 
states of consciousness. Whatever the facts may be, z¢ zs 
entirely certain that a very large part of our effective mem- 
ory is based upon association, and education must find its 
problem in forming the most helpful associations, so that the 
memories involved may be utilized in the most serviceable 
manner. It, therefore, is necessary if we wish to insure 
the recall of some fact or event to see to it that it is linked 
up with as many associations as possible. 
It seems probable that young children, and older ones 
x of defective mental development, depend much more on   
/*  ohiaren %i™MPression than on association for recall. As 
depend the child grows older, the associative factor be- 
more on impression CO™Me€S of greater and greater importance. This, 
than asso- of course, means that the memory material is 
— interpreted more and more in terms of mean- 
ing, and that the mere “ brute fact” as such has less and 
less significance. 
_ Writers on memory, particularly James, have empha- 
& sized the distinction between total and partial recall. 
Potal and 40 2OmMe events are recalled with their entire set- 
i ting, while others are recalled only in skeleton 
outlines. Of course, it is absolutely impossible 
all every minute detail of a previous experience, so 
tal recall, in the strictest sense of the word, does

    Memory 137 
speak of those experiences which are revived in all their 
minutiz as examples of total recall. Obviously, it is not. 
desirable to recall many experiences in this way. Such 
recall is asked for generally only from witnesses on the 
stand, or persons attempting to give an account of happen- 
ings where the smallest details may be extremely signifi- 
cant. Generally speaking, it is the mark of a well-ordered 
mind to omit the unessential details. Often the difference 
between the effective and the poor story-teller lies in the 
fact that the former knows what elements to select to 
bring out the point that he has in mind. The latter, 
however, lured by the multiplicity of details, wanders 
about and arrives nowhere. As the individual grows 
more mature and as his thought processes become more 
controlled by an intent or purpose of his own, he passes from 
total recall, or attempted total recall, to systematically 
planned partial recall. The earliest form of memorization 
demanded of school children is learning by heart, where 
every detail is supposed to be reproduced. As the child 
grows older he is not required to learn in this mechanical 
way, but is supposed to select those materials for memory 
which are the most valuable in terms of the ends for which 
he is memorizing. For effective memory we should not 
burden ourselves with the unessential. We should learn 
the art of forgetting judiciously.

there is a good deal of difference in the vividness of these 
various memories and the ease with which they arise; and 
further that there are periods in the development of the 
individual when certain types of memory are more import- 
ant than others. \ In general with children memory for 
objects of sensation is stronger than are memories of rela- 
tion, such as time and space and cause and effect. Mem- 
ories for things in movement are, on the whole, better than 
for things at rest. Visual memory, as far as form and light 
and shade are concerned, is good, but memory for colors 
is weak. Only by special training and careful observation 
can adults be brought to a point where they can accurately 
distinguish colors. Memory for abstract relationships and 
for emotional states does not seem to be at all well devel- 
oped until the high school age. Further, the various 
kinds of memory show marked fluctuation from time to 
time, with periods of rapid development, and others where 
there is no progress at all, and even perhaps a retrogres- 
sion. Experiments conducted by the Department of Psy- 
chology at the University of Illinois! in connection with 
the written work of the school seem to show that there is 
a general falling off in the various kinds of memory, with 
the exception of the verbal-visual, at the onset of puberty. 
Similar experiments by other investigators? have led to 
conclusions in the same direction. Meumann says that 
the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the child’s life seem 
to be particularly unfavorable for all kinds of memory. 
A number of studies have been made in regard to the 
growth of memory among school children, and it has been 
found, with the exception of those periods indicated in 
the preceding paragraph, that the memory of children in-

-P-A-G-E-163
    Memory r 139 
creases constantly. Meumann says that the adult learns 
various kinds of material in a much shorter time and with 
less repetition and with less fatigue than do ,. ility to 
children. Young children, however, retain what memorize 
they learn more exactly. If this latter state- (rouphout 
ment is true, it is probably because of the fact the school 
that their imagery is more vivid, and the greater 7° 
amount of time which they require in the learning produces 
a greater impression. Zhe point, however, ts to be kept in 
mind that effective memorization seems to increase up to 
maturity, and that decrease tn ability to memorize probably 
does not set in much hi hefore there is an actual decline tn men- 
tal powers in general. 
Meumann! holds that i assertion often made that the memory of 
children, particularly for mechanical learning, is far better than that of 
adults, is not borne out by experimental evidence. The ability 
of children to learn is much less than that of adults. Adults, even in 
middle life, have greater ability to learn than school children in the best 
years of their development. Adults, however, are accustomed to logi- 
cal learning, and children learning with much more difficulty, largely by 
mechanical methods, show somewhat more retentivity. 
It is often asserted that the time to begin the study of a foreign 
language is in childhood, and that mature students are less capable of 
memorizing the rudiments of a foreign language. This is probably not 
true. However, adults approach the mechanical processes involved in 
learning vocabularies, rules for construction, declensions, conjugations, 
etc., often with a positive reluctance. For this reason they are less 
capable of acquiring the elements of a foreign language than are 
children. If they entered upon the task with determination and zest, 
their success would be far greater than that of the immature pupil. 
_ The rate-of forgetting of various materials is a question 
of no little pedagogical significance. The first experi- 
ments to determine the rapidity of forgetting were made 
by Ebbinghaus,” thirty years ago, and for a long time 
served as the final authority on the manner in which cer- 
tain kinds of material fade from the mind. Ebbinghaus

used himself as the subject of his experiments, and memo 
rized meaningless material (nonsense syllables). The re- 
The fading sults of the investigation of Ebbinghaus showed 
of memory that for the materials and methods employed by 
ee him there was a rapid loss in memory, especially 
tive factor during the first few hours after learning, and 
is weak. that the loss after a few days was relatively 
slight. During the first hour over half of what was learned 
had been forgotten ; at the end of the first day two thirds, 
but at the end of a month only about four fifths. Since 
Ebbinghaus attempted to exclude all associative factors in 
his learning, he really tested not the loss of memory as 
such, but merely the fading of the memory after-image. 
Attempts have been made to study the fading of various 
materials other than those employed by Ebbinghaus, such 
as color, brightness, linear extent, tones of definite pitches, 
and even tactile stimuli. More recent experiments have 
shown indirectly that the rate of forgetting when associ- 
ation is joined with impression is very much less rapid than 
the results of Ebbinghaus and of others who have worked 
in similar fields would lead us to suppose. Judeed, it often 
happens that reproduction of material learned is best after an 
interval has elapsed between the learning and the recall. 
This improvement in memory seems to be due to the fact 
that the original impressions have had an opportunity to 
become associated with permanent elements in conscious- 
ness, and, therefore, are capable of revival more readily 
after a certain lapse of time. This fact, which is of great 
educational significance, will be discussed more fully ina 
later part of this chapter. 
The question whether a person has forgotten something 
The Methoa that he has previously learned is not as simple 
Xe Retained as might at first seem. The common method of Members in hola : . . esting ascertaining what is remembered is to determine 
_ memory. how much of the original material learned can 
be reproduced immediately, or after any definite interval.
-P-A-G-E-165
Memory 141 
This method of testing is commonly known as the Method 
of Retained Members, and the accuracy of memory is 
measured by the total amount of material kept in mind. 
If, for example, a person has learned a series of words by 
heart and an hour later can reproduce two thirds of them, 
this fraction represents the accuracy of his memory for the 
material at that time. It is, however, perfectly clear, al- 
though he may be unable to reproduce a single one of the 
words or syllables learned, that his consciousness has been 
modified and in a sense his entire memory for the series 
has not been destroyed. JZheoretically there 1s nothing once 
learned that may not, under certain conditions, be revived in 
memory. There are examples in psychological literature 
which show that under abnormal mental conditions facts 
and events which seem to have been completely forgotten 
most unexpectedly reappear above the threshold of con- 
sciousness. Obviously, then, there should be some other 
way of testing the memory than that by the Method of 
Retained Members, if we wish to make sure that no traces 
of a previous experience have been left behind. 
To do this a second method of testing memory has been 
devised. It is the one used by Ebbinghaus in the experi- 
ment previously mentioned. It is technically ie ae 
known as the Saving Method, and consists es- iMewnne ar 
sentially in learning the material at a prescribed testing ; : memory. 
uniform rate of speed, the readings neces- 
sary for learning being repeated until the’first correct re- 
petition is obtained. The number of repetitions necessary 
for this original learning is then recorded. After the ma- 
terial has been learned and a certain interval has elapsed 
(e.g. twenty-four hours ) the series is relearned and the time 
saved in the relearning is noted. 
The following, taken from Myers', gives a record of such a memory 
test for periods of relearning, varying from one third of an hour toa 
month :—

  The above is a record of one hundred and sixty-three experiments, 
nearly all of which consisted in learning eight thirteen-syllable series 
and in relearning them at a prescribed rate of reading after a varying in- 
terval, the economy of time spent in relearning being in each instance 
noted. 
Another important method of testing memory is techni- 
cally known as the Method of Right Associates. According 
oc Methog t2 this method, as employed in the psychologi- 
of Right cal laboratory, a series of syllables is read a num- 
en ber of times rhythmically. Generally the first 
syllable is accented and the second syllable is without stress, 
as, for example, d¢b'-sev; roz'—lut; cac'—ron; dyt'—hif. 
After an interval, the accuracy of memory is tested by pre- 
senting the accented syllable of the trochaic pair, and re- 
cording the number of right associates that are called up 
with the accented syllables. In this connection the amount 
of time between the presenting of the accented syllable 
and the recall of the unaccented syllable is accurately 
measured, and it has been found that ¢hose associations 
which are the most lasting generally take the shortest time 
for recall, Some important facts in regard to the way in 
which associated groups are formed have been discovered 
by this method of testing memory. These will be dis- 
cussed in a later section and their significance in the psy- 
chology of learning pointed out. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  Memory 143 
Some other and less important methods of testing the memory may be 
summarized as follows: (2) The Prompting Method. In this method 
the material is imperfectly learned and the accuracy of the memory | 
measured by the amount of prompting required. It is difficult to bring 
this method under exact experimental determination, but it is one that 
is, of course, familiar in the schoolroom and has a certain value ; (0) 
The Recognition Method. In this method the material for memoriza- 
tion is presented and learned, and later the same material, together with 
other material of a similar nature, is shown. The test of memory con- 
sists in picking out from the total mass of material that which was pre- 
viously presented. It is clear that in certain phases of school work 
this is the test of memory that is ordinarilyemployed; (¢) The Recon- 
struction Method. In this method the memory material is given in some 
sort of order, and later it is presented in a different order. The mem- 
ory test consists in restoring it to its original arrangement. 
The value of the various above described methods of test- 
ing the memory depends very largely on the purposes 
for which the material was originally memorized. ‘iia cea ; e 
Undoubtedly the mostcommon method practiced value of 
in the schools is that of Retained Members, eae 4 
The child is asked to reproduce verbatim what testing 
he has learned, and his school grade is de- “°° 
termined by the fidelity with which he succeeds in doing 
this. For some varieties of material absolute reproduction 
is the only kind desirable. For example, the child must 
know how each word in his spelling lesson is written if 
he has learned the lesson; a test of his knowledge of 
the multiplication table is the number of parts of it that 
he can exactly reproduce. On the other hand, especially 
with older children and adults, there are certain kinds of 
materials that need not be carried always in the mind. 
It is desirable to reproduce them only as they are needed. 
It is quite certain that in most instances the graduate of 
a high school could not pass an examination which he 
took with ease at the end of his course in the elementary 
school. This does not, however, imply that what he has 
previously learned is of no value. If it were necessary, 
he could, with a relatively slight expenditure of energy,

144 The Learning Process 
relearn all that he has in the meantime forgotten. It is 
likewise true that there are certain memory materials which 
_need to be reproduced only in connection with others which 
have been definitely associated with them, as, for exam- 
ple, certain dates in history in connection with certain 
events. For many kinds of material the only memory that 
is necessary or desirable is that of simple recognition on 
the presentation of this material. This would apply to the © 
pupil’s knowledge of various tools and instruments used in 
, his school work. It is not supposed that he will carry the 
memory image of these tools with him, but that merely on 
seeing them he shall be able to recognize them and know 
how to use them. Reconst:uction is also an important fac- 
tor in certain parts of the school work. To be able to put 
together in the right order various features of an outline 
map, such as cities, bodies of water, and mountain ranges, 
is a more valuable test of geographical knowledge than 
the ability to reproduce the names of capitals, counties, 
boundary lines, and so forth. In general the schools have 
relied too much in their estimation of the acquisitions of 
children on the memory test of Retained Members.

ASSOCIATION 
THE importance of association in memory has fora long 
time been recognized. Aristotle, in his treatise on “ Memory . . 9) . . 
and Reminiscence,” laid down certain fundamen- he Jaws of 
tal laws of association, distinguishing associa- Association : sé eS by Con- 
tion by similarity, by contrast, and by contiguity. tiguity and 
These principles were worked over to an extent Similarity. 
during the Middle Ages, and have been amplified in modern 
times, especially by Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Hartley, and 
more recent Associationists in British philosophy. Thetwo _ 
fundamental laws, as finally formulated, are known as the. 
principles of Association by Contiguity in Space and Time, 
and Association by Similarity and Contrast. 
Illustrations of these laws are easy to find. For example, if in learning 
nonsense syllables, the syllables #ze7 and 7'¢ come side by side.or one 
- after the other, on the presentation of the first, the second tends to come 
into mind rather than some subsequent or preceding syllable. Again, if 
on crossing the railroad track I am accustomed each time to see the flag- 
man, I associate the track and the flagman in such a way that when I 
see or think of the former I am likely to recall the lattet, and vice versa. 
Two events happening at the same time are more likely to be recalled 
than two between which there is an interval. Attempts have been 
made to explain this general fact of association in terms of purely physi- 
ological laws. Those brain cells which are stimulated at approximately 
the same time are supposed to be more likely to form associative bonds 
than those which are stimulated with a time interval between them; 
those which lie more closely together are more apt to be connected than 
those that are separated by some distance. The principle of Associa- 
tion by Resemblance finds illustration in the recall of a friend not pres- 
ent, on seeing some one who resembles him. The full moon may bring 
to mind a balloon, because of the roundness of each. A red flag may, 
on the same principle, suggest bloodshed. The principle of contrast

146 The Learning Process | | 
is the exact reverse of that of resemblance. Darkness brings to mind 
light; beauty suggests ugliness, and the wintry landscape the luxurious 
foliage of summer. 
It ts to be remembered, however, that there 1s no funda- 
mental difference in the association by simtlarity and by 
contrast. The difference ts in the attitude or the purpose of 
the persin making the comparison. Fromone point of view 
the night may suggest solitude, and from another its oppo- 
site, —the brightness of the morning. Neither resemblance 
nor difference resides entirely in the object as such, but 
only in the object as it exists for the person who perceives 
it. Therefore, the principle of resemblance, if it is to be 
made serviceable in any genuine way, must be interpreted 
in terms of the purpose which exists as the end of the 
thought process. | 
It is also to be noticed that what seems to be the purely 
physiological law of contiguity is likewise to be interpreted 
Both the | Under this same principle of purpose. I recall 
above laws two events in history that may be separated by explained in 
hae a many years, as, for example, the battle of Sa- 
purpose. § Jamis and the battle of Santiago Bay, because of 
some relation between them that is constructed by the 
purpose or point of view which I have in mind. The 
illustration has already been given of the association be- 
tween the railway crossing and the flagman on the principle 
of spatial contiguity. It might happen, however, that this 
association would be entirely destroyed if the railway cross- 
ing were connected with some other circumstance more 
important in the mind of the person making the association. 
For example, if at the time when the pedestrian was cross- 
ing the track, he narrowly escaped being run over by an 
approaching train, on thinking of the track subsequently, 
he would recall, not the flagman, but the narrow escape 
from death. It should then be berne in mind that erceft 
Jor associations of the most superficial character, these two 
laws of similarity and contiguity can be made effective in    
-P-A-G-E-171
    Association 147 
the learning process only by subjecting them to the higher law 
of purpose or aim. 
These laws have been experimentally worked out by two principal 
methods. According to one method, the subject tested is given a word 
to which he is to react with the one which is immediately suggested. 
This he writes down, as he does also the word that is suggested by this 
second word, and so on till the testis finished. According to the Second 
method, the person reacts immediately to a presented word with the 
first association that comes into his mind,after which a second word is 
presented to him, to which *he also reacts, and so on. These varions 
kinds of reactions have been classified. Myers! gives an example CF 
such a classification as follows : — 
coordination e.g. baby — infant 
superordination e.g. soldier — man in meaning or ; 
subordination e.g. man — soldier 
Sinai larity contrast e.g. peace — war 
in letters or 
in sound syllables é.g. port — porter 
in rhyme e.g. fight — kite 
fo his causal e.g. lightning — thunder 
px verbal é.g. one — two Contiguity snow — snowball 
in space e.g. handle — lock 
Several interesting facts are to be noted about these various classes 
of association. In the first place, those that are the most superficial are 
the associations by similarity in rhyme; they can hardly be explained 
in terms of conscious association. It is often the mark of a disintegrat- 
ing mind to form superficial associations, characterized by similarity of 
sound. The only explanation that seems to be at all adequate for such 
kinds o: mental relationship is a physiological explanation. The varie- 
ties of association in order of decreasing superficiality are, first, those 
of contiguity in space and time, then of verbal and causal contiguity ; 
while associations through similarity in meaning are dominated to a 
very large extent by the aim or purpose which the person has either 
clearly or subconsciously in his mind when he forms such associations. 
It has been found, that the whole direction of associations of this char- 
acter is changed when the subject is told to change his attitude toward 
the stimulus word with which the reaction word is associated, For ex- 
1 Op. cit., p. 152.

  148 The Learning Process — 
ample, the subject is told by the experimenter that when he sees the 
stimulus word he is to react with a codrdinate, superordinate, subordi- 
nate, or contrast word, ‘as the case may be; or, perhaps, he is told to 
react with a word which is causally connected with the first. It may be 
seen from such examples as these that the attitude of the subject is a 
very important factor in determining the direction in which the associa- 
tive links are formed. 
The significance for education in this connection is ob- 
vious. The teacher ts not to rely on these purely olyective 
and mechanical laws of association, but he ts 
a. to guide his pupils through direct instruction or 
rely . through suggestion to form those assoctations ure ° ‘ . . 
Sentot which shall have the most practical significance 
aia in terms of the purposes of the lesson in hand. 
If these laws are treated in a purely objec- 
tive manner, they will have extremely little value in the 
learning process. This does not imply that some of the 
more mechanical aspects of association should not be given 
attention. But it does mean that these mechanical ele- 
ments in themselves have no ultimate value in the learning 
process, unless they are linked up with higher and purposive 
associations. ‘When other means fail, the teacher may be 
justified in availing himself of mechanical devices for 
memorization, even the reliance on senseless jingles, if 
these associations are to be worked over ultimately in terms 
of a significant purpose. 
The old device of learning the succession of the sovereigns of Eng- 
land or of the presidents of the United States in verse is justifiable, if later 
these same personages are to be woven into a connected and meaning- 
ful set of associations in the development of the history of England 
or of America. The principal criticism that is to be brought against 
such methods as these is that they too often end in themselves, and 
lead to no useful result. If this be true, they are worthless and inde- 
fensible; but on the other hand, if these mechanical associations are 
used as the basis of higher and more purposive as they may 
be valuable.1

Beside the primary laws of association already discussed, 
there are certain secondary laws that are of equal import- 
ance. These are generally termed the Laws . a The sec- 
of Primacy, Recency, Frequency and Vividness. ondary laws 
The Law of Primacy asserts that, other things of associa- 
being equal, the first word in a series, the first 
new experience, and so forth, are better remembered than 
those that follow. The Jesuits, in planning their scheme 
of religious education, have emphasized the beginnings of 
instruction as the most important, because these make the 
most definite impression on the mind and are the most last- 
ing. It is the first day of school, the first pair of long 
trousers, the first visit to the theater, that are recalled 
among early memories; the many days succeeding and 
the many experiences of a similar sort coming in these 
succeeding days tend to drop out of memory. The Law of 
Recency asserts that, other things being equal, the last 
things are those best remembered. So it is that the last 
word in the series, ‘the last day of the school, my most 
recent visit to the theater, my newest suit of clothes, are 
more readily recalled than the events and things that 
have preceded. The Law of Vividness asserts that the 
things that make the most definite impression at the time 
of their presentation, other things being equal, are best 
retained. So for this reason the child remembers those days 
in school best in which something novel happened, as, for 
example, the visit of his mother, an unusually successful 
or unsuccessful examination, or the coming of a new 
teacher. Finally, the Law of Frequency asserts that those 
things that are the most often repeated are the best remem- 
bered._This law has been the one which has been recog- 
nized by schoolmasters of all times, and is the one most 
readily utilizable in the learning process. It lies at the 
foundation of all drill, and has been carried to such an ex- 
treme that it has been severely criticized; to an extent 
with no small degree of justice. Yet it is a law which
-P-A-G-E-174
     150 The Learning Process 
| | 
must be appealed to in a great many instances, and is the 
‘chief method of memorization in the earlier years of 
learning. 
These laws have been worked out experimentally in various direc- 
tions. One of the principal attempts at demonstrating them was made 
by Miss Calkins! and published in 1896. In general the validity of 
these four laws was clearly established. Seashore? gives the following 
instructive introspections of a subject’s associations, in response to the 
key-word “ fig”: — 
“Fig suggested apple, because apple is the most ;common ( freq.) 
specimen of the kind of a thing a fig is, a fruit. Apple suggested tree, 
because they had been experienced together most frequently (freq.). 
Tree suggested blossoms, because I had been looking for blossoms on 
the cherry tree this morning (rec.). Blossoms suggested bee, because 
bees are frequently seen with blossoms, and their presence has an excit- 
ing interest (freq. and int.). Bee suggested honey, because bee and 
honey are thought of as cause and effect (freq.). Honey suggested 
juice of a flower, because the image of honey has followed the image of 
flowers (rec.). Flower-juice suggested sweetness, because sweetness is 
the principal characteristic of flower-juice or honey (int. and freq.).” 
The most recent experimentation in the psychology of learning has 
shown in a rather striking way the greater ease of retention of the begin- 
ning and the end of a series learned than of the middle portion. The 
following table given by Myers in his “ Experimental Psychology ” (p. 
159) sums up the results of the learning of a series of words of twelve and 
of tenmembers respectively, by the prompting method. Itcan be readily 
seen that the position of the different members in the series is an 
important element in the recall.; that the first member of the series is 
remembered best of all ; that there is an increasing inability to remem- 
ber, which reaches its maximum a little beyond the middle of the series, 
and falls off pronouncedly at the end. The table is as follows : —

In another experiment, by the Method of Right Associates with twelve 
and eighteen-syllable word-series, it was found that in the case of the 
twelve-syllable series there were sixty per cent of right associates as 
against seventy-one per cent with many repetitions ; further that there

were thirty-three instances of right associates that took less than two 
seconds with few repetitions, as against forty with many repetitions. 
For the eighteen-syllable series there were forty-seven per cent of right 
associates with few repetitions, as against sixty-nine per cent with many 
repetitions. Further, there were twenty-one right associates that took 
less than two seconds with few repetitions, as compared with twenty- 
seven with many repetitions. This experiment shows the value of fre- 
quency of repetition in learning. It also shows that “the number of 
associations which after a few repetitions are almost ready to rise above 
the threshold ( of memory) and become effective is considerably greater 
in longer than in shorter series.” This would indicate the greater 
value of many repetitions the larger the amount of material to be 
memorized. 
In discussing the primary laws of association ( contiguity 
in space and time and similarity ) it was pointed out that 
in order for these to be highly effective they pe princi- 
should be reinterpreted in terms of purpose or Ple of pur- : . ° ose in 
end. What is true of these primary laws is also U etecanint 
true to a considerable degree of these second- ing the secondary 
ary laws. The principle of vividness in par- taws of 
ticular is to be interpreted very largely in terms *8s°ciation. 
of meaning. By vividness is not meant, at least in the 
higher intellectual processes, mere sensory vividness, but a 
vividness of meaning. Those things attract attention 
which have significance. 
The mother tired out with caring for her sick child will fall asleep 
while the child rests. Her slumbers may not be disturbed by the 
loudest noises, and yet she will awaken at the first restless movements 
of the child. In Whittier’s poem, “ The Pipes at Lucknow,” the High- 
land woman hears above the roar of the Sepoy guns and the cries of 
the besieged and besiegers, faintly in the distance, the piping of the 
MacGregor clan coming to the rescue of the British defenders. The

-P-A-G-E-176
152 The Learning Process 
  ~" r 
sound of the piping which attracted her attention could not be called 
in any objective sense intense or vivid. It was the vividness due to ‘ts 
meaning or significance that gave it an important place in Consciousness. 
In the lowest stages of the learning process the vivid- 
ness is more objective. It is the bright light, the loud 
noise, the rapidly moving object, that attracts the attention. 
In the training of defectives it is this objective vividness 
that must be largely relied on; but for all higher mental 
processes the chief importance of vividness is found in its 
significance in the train of thought of the learner. Of the 
other three principles referred to, — primacy, recency, and 
frequency, —the two latter depend largely upon physio- 
logical conditions for their explanation. However, the 
first experience is apt to be remembered largely because 
of the inherent interest that is called forth by novelty. 
On the other hand, the most recent event is better remem- 
bered, partly because the memory image has had less 
chance to fade from the mind than have those of preced- 
ing events. Constant repetition may be thought of as 
impressing the nervous system more and more, and thus 
causing the object concerned in the impression to be 
better retained. However, it must be remembered that 
recency, as well as primacy, possesses novelty because of 
its position in a series of events. Even constant repetition 
will have little effect unless that which is repeated is 
attended to and enters into the associations formed in a 
significant way. Repeating a grade, or taking a subject in 
the high school a second time, often proves of little benefit 
to the pupil. The lack of positive results in this instance 
is probably to be explained because through the repetition 
the interest in the subject matter becomes deadened, 
and, therefore, no permanent impression is made in con- 
sciousness. Indeed, to repeat once more the thought 
that is so important educationally that perhaps it cannot 
be overemphasized, no learning has ultimate value unless 
it enter into the conscious complex in such a way that it 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
    Association 153 
fits meaningfully into this complex. The mechanical laws 
of association possess value only in so far as they furnish 
the materials for associations of the higher type. © 
The four principles of primacy, recency, frequency, and vividness 
find ample illustrations in school practice. The Law of Vividness is 
well illustrated in what Bagley has termed the principle of vivid 
portrayal, which he considers one of the most effective ways of focaliz- 
ing a habit. The use of stereoscopic slides in the study of geography, 
history, and the natural sciences is an admirable case in point. It 
gives a concreteness and reality which cannot be obtained in any other 
way. Every school should possess ample illustrative material of this 
sort, and likewise a good projection lantern with plenty of slides. 
Charts, models, maps, and concrete materials of all sorts should be 
utilized. It should, however, be remembered that such materials are 
to be used to illustrate the thought and not as ends in themselves. It 
is possible here, as in every department of education, to go to extremes, 
and to obscure the significance of the subject matter by injudicious 
emphasis on incidentals rather than on essentials. Certain subjects in 
the curriculum cannot, with ease, be illustrated in the concrete manner 
above indicated. There are, however, certain devices that readily 
accomplish the purpose of making more vivid the essence of the subject 
matter that is being taught. Perry! enumerates in his chapter on 
“The Use of the Blackboard” some of these. He advocates the 
liberal use of various colored chalks? to bring out important facts and 
relations. For example, “ Emphasis that is made in speech by accent 
may be made in board writing by colored words or underlining.” In 
the word “separate ” the first a may be written in red chalk. <A formula 
may be written in colors, and its application in the white chalk. In 
studying the structure of a sentence, the various parts of speech may be 
written in different colors. “Unseen lines in an illustration may best 
be indicated in color.” 
The principle of primacy, which demands that those things to be 
remembered be given an initial position, comes into conflict with the 
educational practice of developing a subject. It is a debatable question 
whether it is not advisable to place the important things first, rather 
than to lead up to them through an extended discussion and explana- 
1 Problems of the Elementary School” (New York, 1910). 
2 Taylor (Jour. of Pedagogy, XVI, 1903) reports an experiment that tends 
to show that the use of colored chalk to emphasize silent and obscure letters 
has little value unless the pupil’s attention is further called to the fact of the 
colored letters and the reasons for so coloring them.
-P-A-G-E-178
  154 The Learning Process 
nized as valid in literature, is not to be ignored in pedagogy. Some of 
the older textbooks, as, for example, J. E. Worcester’s “ Epitome of 
Modern Geography,” published in 1820, start with definitions and im- 
portant principles. 
In following the principle of recency, emphasis must be placed on 
the impressions made at the end of a course of study or a school 
exercise. The last must be, if possible, the best. Here should come 
summaries and final explanations. It is well to have the climax at the 
end. 
To the four secondary laws of association another has 
been added, which is termed by James “congruity of 
Coabratty emotional tone.” By this he intends to signify 
of emotional the fact that the direction and nature of the 
i associations is to a considerable extent deter- 
mined by the feeling or emotional state in which the 
individual is. If a person is depressed and gloomy, he is 
apt, for example, on seeing a winter’s landscape to asso- 
ciate with it ideas of barrenness and solitude; while, on 
the other hand, if he is in a cheerful mood, the sparkle of 
the ice, the bracing nature of the atmosphere, and the 
holiday appearance of the landscape are the things that 
predominate in his mind. This is, again, an illustration of 
the fact that the znterests, atms, and values that a person 
brings to his facts determine, tn a very large manner, the 
selection of the elements to be associated and the direction of 
such associations. 
One of the most important facts from the standpoint of 
educational procedure that has recently been The influ- ° ‘ ence of brought out in laboratory experiments on mem- 
retroactive ory is that an association or set of associa- - inhibition. : 5 cpp

For example, let 4-2 represent a series of associations formed dur- 
ing a certain learning period, and C—D represent another series of asso- 
ciations formed immediately after A—A, or with only a short interval 
between. It has been clearly demonstrated that there is a marked 
tendency for the C-D associations to break up the associated bonds in 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  Association 155 
the A-B group. This is technically known as retroactive inhibition, 
and it has been found to occur, not only when the second associations 
were similar to the first, but even when they were quite dissimilar. 
As an illustration of this may be cited the fact that the examining of 
pictures immediately after learning a series of nonsense syllables has 
been found to weaken the memory for the nonsense syllables. How- 
ever, it is probably true that the greater the similarity between the 
material learned during the second period and that learned during the 
first period, the greater is also the strength of the retroactive inhibition. 
The explanation of this phenomenon is probably to be 
found in a large measure in the fact that it takes a certain 
amount of time for associations to fix themselves; andifa 
period of learning is immediately followed by another, the 
first associations do not have the chance of becoming as 
permanently established as if there were an interval of 
rest between. The importance of this fact in practical 
pedagogy, especially in arranging 4 program of studies, 
needs hardly to be commented on. 
It has further been discovered that associations are 
more apt to be formed between immediately consecutive 
members of a series than between members 
more widely separated, and that the association 2 ae 
is further in a forward direction. In other Principal as- eee, sociations. 
words, it is much more easy to recall the asso- 
ciation a—d-c-d than the reverse, d—c—d-a. With sense 
material it is even more difficult to recall associations 
in the reverse direction than it is with nonsense material. 
This is, of course, to be explained by the general “ drift” 
of consciousness in terms of meaning. In significant 
material associations are formed not merely between 
the various parts of the group, but the associations also 
connect themselves up with the meaning of the group as 
a whole. The associations formed between consecutive 
members are technically known as “ principal associations.” 
It is, however, quite obvious that in anything but mechan- 
ical learning with nonsense material the consecutive mem- 
bers of a series or group may not be the elements that 
~
-P-A-G-E-180
    156 The Learning Process — 
| 
stand side by side in the thought process, but the elements 
which are related more closely in terms of the meaning 
of that which is to be learned. For this reason, in mean- 
ingful material, we may assign the name “ principal associa- 
tions” to those which most naturally belong together in 
terms of the general thought or meaning. 
Beside the formation of associative bonds between the 
parts of a given piece of memory material that stand 
closest together, either in order or in significance, The forma- 
tion of there is a tendency to form in a lesser degree 
remote as- subsidiary and remote associations. The sociations. 
strength of the remote associations grows less, 
directly according to their distance from each other or 
according to their remoteness in meaning, Subsidiary and 
remote associations fade more rapidly from memory than 
do principal associations. For this reason, care must be 
taken in the learning process, when dealing with meaning- 
ful materials, to select and emphasize the principal associa- 
tions. 
While the general tendency to form one set of associa- 
tions is to inhibit the formation of others through retroac- 
zie ecttun tive inhibition, it is possible that the formation 
reinforce- Of one set of associations which is closely related 
one to another that has preceded it may strengthen 
the associative bonds in this first set of associations. Myers 
states the principle as follows: ‘ Whena syllable a, which 
has been already firmly associated with 4, is presented with 
c, the association a—d is strengthened.’ This seems to hold 
good only when the first association has been strongly 
formed. If it has not, the second association tends to break 
up and destroy the first. 
The reason for this may be made clear from the following considera- 
tion. Ifa and é are strongly joined together in associative bonds, then 
the association @-c will tend to call up the association a—d, because of 
the inherent tendency of a to associate itself with 6. Therefore, every 
time that the association a@—c is presented, the association a — 4 will tend 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
( 
Association 157 
  to appear. On the other hand, if they are not joined in strong associa- 
tive bonds, the tendency will be to establish the association a—c to the 
exclusion and complete destruction of a—4. The significance of this 
fact in relation to the learning process is clearly that the first associa- 
tions are to be impressed with sufficient strength, so that the formation 
of subsequent similar associations will tend to strengthen the first, 
rather than to destroy them. Inthe distribution of time, then, in learn- 
ing, we should take care to see that a due amount is given to the 
associations first formed. 
Experiments have shown that when the important word 
in a series of nonsense syllables, or in a phrase or sentence 
of meaningful material is given, there is a ten- Tendency 
dency to reproduce the first word; for example, toward 
the word “liberty” tends to recall the beginning imitial re- 
of the verse “ My Country ’tis of thee,” etc. The ose 
underlying reason for this tendency is doubtless to be found 
in the fact that we associate the parts of a series or a sen- 
tence in terms of meaning, and the meaning is carried 
necessarily in one direction only, namely, from the initial 
word toward the completion of the thought. . This is true 
to an extent with nonsense material, because of the fact 
that in most cases such material is in part learned through 
some sort of meaningful associations. 
Experiments have also demonstrated the fact that the 
age of an association is an important element in its reten- 
tion. By the age of the association is meant »,, kine 
the length of time since it was first set up. For the associa- 
example, a poem learned a week ago has a “™ 
greater age in this sense than one learned yesterday. 
Jost,! who experimentally investigated the relation between 
the strength of associations and recall, has formulated the

the younger associations. When two associations are of 
equal strength, but unlike age, the younger fades more 
rapidly than does the older.’”’ Stated concretely, the first 
part of this law means that if I know two poems of like 
length and similar character equally well at the present 
time, a given number of repetitions will more firmly fix the 
poem first learned than the one learned later. The second 
part of the law signifies that if I know, for example, these 
same two poems equally well at the present time, a month 
from to-day I can recall better the one learned first. This 
fact has, of course, considerable practical significance. It 
can be readily seen that I accomplish more in studying 
over something that I have had in my mind a consider- 
able length of time than I can accomplish by giving an 
equal amount of study to fresh material. This has a bear- 
ing upon the value of short courses and subjects continued 
but a relatively small time in the school work. The under- 
lying significance of Jost’s law is to be explained by the 
principle already referred to in another connection, that it 
takes some time for associations to form permanently. 
The fact that the pupil has learned a certain amount of 
memory material so that he can reproduce tt with facility, 
is no warrant that what he has learned will be of any 
permanent value to him. There must further be added the 
fact that this learning has been extended over a considerable 
interval of time, so that the associations have a chance to 
fix themselves permanently. This fixing further is not 
to be understood in a merely mechanical way, for it is 
undoubtedly true that the longer associations are carried 
in consciousness, the greater is the extent to which they 
join themselves with other elements, and the greater is 
their meaning and significance. (

  CHAPTER XI 
ECONOMY IN MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 
THERE are undoubtedly tremendous wastes in the tech 
nique of learning. Some of these escape observation, and 
indeed are very difficult to discover by ordinary Ey j Economy in 
experimental methods. However, when wecome gmati mat- 
to consider memory and association, at least in ters of 
their more simple forms, we find a considerable eae 
amount of fairly definite knowledge in regard to the most 
economical methods of learning. These economies, al- 
though they may not seem of the greatest importance in 
education, are not to be ignored. In the industrial world 
the attempt has been more and more to eliminate wasteful 
and extravagant methods, the smallest detail in saving 
being emphasized. A little thought should make it appar- 
ent to us that zf we can economize in the smallest matters 
of learning, we shall save in the aggregate a large amount 
of time and much useless expenditure of energy. 
A number of experiments, beginning about a decade 
ago, have, been made in regard to the so-called “ whole”’ 
and “part” methods of learning. The first of 
these was undertaken by Lottie Steffens.1 By a Meee 
the whole method is meant the memorizing of methods of 3 : Seat learning. ° 
a piece of material by beginning at the com- vr 
mencement and continuing straight through to the end, - 
following this method during the entire learning period. 
By the part method is meant learning the memory material 
insections. For example, the pupil may learn Longfellow’s 
“Psalm of Life” in various ways. He can commit it line’

  160 The Learning Process 
by line, or stanza by stanza; or he may proceed from the 
first line directly to the last, and then, beginning the 
process over again, so continue until the whole poem is 
mastered. Probably most persons, if left to their own 
devices in learning, would pursue the second course, namely 
of committing the poem stanza by stanza. Perhaps a few 
would attempt the learning line by line, and still fewer 
the learning of itas a whole. Both the first two methods 
are forms of the part method of learning. 
Notwithstanding the almost universal belief and prac- 
tice, the part method of learning seems to be less econom- 
Advantages ical than the whole method, especially when 
Sas oe meaningful material is concerned. Indeed, 
ta thie some investigators go so far as to assert that 
methods. even with nonsense material the whole method 
has a slight advantage over the part method. This, how- 
ever, is to be doubted. 
The reason for the superiority of the whole method as compared 
with the part method in learning meaningful material is usually ex- 
plained by the fact that in learning the material as a whole, the proper 
associations are formed. If a poem is learned stanza by stanza, then 
the associations set up are, for example, between the last words in a 
stanza and the first words in the same stanza, whereas the proper as- 
sociations would be between the last words in the stanza and the first 
words in the stanza next following. Hence, when the poem is learned 
by the part method, a large number of incorrect associations are formed, 
and this necessitates not only the learning of the newand proper asso- 
ciations, but the breaking up of the old associations as well. 
While undoubtedly with laboratory subjects under strict 
- experimental conditions, the whole method of memoriza- 
. tion is much to be preferred to the part method, it has cer- 
tain disadvantages in the ordinary learning of the school- 
room. Among these disadvantages may be mentioned 
first that arising from fatigue in attempting to master a 
_targe amount of material by the whole method. The fa- 
tigue, however, is probably more apparent than real, and 
arises largely because of the discouragement which
-P-A-G-E-185
  Economy in Memory and Association 161 
comes to the pupil in failing to notice progress in his 
memorization. _ 
It can readily be seen that if ten minutes were spent in learning the 
“Psalm of Life,” there would be little evidence of progress during the 
period, if the learning were by the whole method, while if the poem 
were learned stanza by stanza, the progress would be clearly evident. 
According to the first method of procedure a considerable number of 
words would have been raised up close to the memory threshold (7.¢. the 
point just below which they are to appear in memory), but none would 
have passed over it, and, therefore, there would be no indication of 
progress. In thesecond method, however, perhaps a whole stanza would 
have been committed during the ten-minute period, and clear progress 
would be evident. For the child this lack of evident progress is a 
great discouragement; and the result is that he loses interest in learn- 
ing; and this loss is fatal to the accomplishment of his task. Another 
reason why the whole method is not in every instance superior to the 
part method is to be found in the circumstance that a part of the mem- 
ory material is much more difficult to bring above the threshold of 
memory than are other parts; so it not infrequently happens that a 
large number of repetitions of the entire memory material are necessary 
in order to learn that small portion of the whole which refuses readily 
to be memorized. A third, and perhaps the principal disadvantage of the 
whole method, lies in the fact that it is much less easy during the learn- 
ing to practice recall than it is in the case of the part method. As will 
be seen later, recall is a most important factor. However, these various 
difficulties may be partly or entirely obviated if certain precautions are 
taken. 
In the first place, the pupil should be informed of the ad- 
vantages of the whole method and his interest stimulated in 
learning by this means. Thus he will tend to over- , 0 
come his inherent prejudices against the method, tageous 
and will not so easily be discouraged, if resultsare Odea” 
not immediately apparent. Further, he should whole — » 
be told to study the whole piece to be memorized es 
up to the point where the difficult parts become particularly 
prominent; then to confine his attention for a while to 
the difficult portions, and after that, again to continue 
learning by the whole method. He should also be 
instructed that after a certain time he should attempt to 
M
-P-A-G-E-186
  162 The Learning Process 
recall, as far as possible, what he has been studying. It 
will probably be found, especially for older pupils and 
adults, that if this method, with the modifications indicated 
is followed until it becomes habitual, a considerable amount 
of time will be saved in the learning of ordinary material. 
Learning by the whole or part method should be care- 
fully distinguished from the learning of memory material 
ike entirely at one sitting or at various sittings. To 
ee refer to the ‘Psalm of Life” again, it is possible 
trated to spend an hour on it without pausing, or to learning. . 3 ; 
spend two thirty-minute intervals, or perhaps to 
spend four fifteen-minute intervals on the learning. As to 
the value of these various ways of learning material, there 
seems to be some doubt, although again laboratory experi- 
ments show that the distribution of learning over a con- 
siderable period is economical. 
Among the reasons why distributed learnings are better than concen- 
trated learnings may be mentioned first the fatigue of long periods of 
learning, with accompanying loss of interest and the falling off ofattention. 
The principal reason for the superiority of learning in several sittings 
over learning in a few seems to lie in the fact already referred to, that 
the age of the associations is an important factor in retention. So it 
happens that if the learning of the memory material has covered, for 
example, a week, at the end of the period of learning the age of the 
associations first established is clearly greater than if the learning had 
occupied one or two days. The associations, being extended over a 
greater period when the material is distributed, have greater opportunity 
to become permanent and to acquire significance. 
It is a fact well known that cramming is a bad method of learning. 
It is quite possible for a clever student to prepare for an examination 
in a few days and to pass the test with a high grade. The more 
systematic worker, however, who has been preparing his material for 
weeks and months, although he may not obtain any better results on 
the immediate test, will carry the substance of his studies much farther 
than will the person who learns in haste, and the significance will be 
far greater. There is a prevailing opinion that a great deal can be 
accomplished by spurts ; and while it is undoubtedly true that there is a 
certain value arising from a great expenditure of energy at particular 
periods, the final results accomplished by the person who works in  
-P-A-G-E-187
\ 
Economy in Memory and Association 163 
spurts cannot be compared with the results obtained by the systematic 
worker, who can keep his learning distributed over long periods with a 
fixed degree of regularity and with a permanent interest. 
There is, however, another aspect to the matter. Some of the 
reasons why the method of learning material by distributing it over 
various periods is unsatisfactory are the following: First, it requires a 
certain amount of time to adjust the attention to the subject at hand. 
In all learning there is this period of “ warming up,” which is particularly 
long with those individuals whose ability to adapt their attention 
readily isslow. It is clear, then, that during this warming up process the 
learning is not proceeding under the very best conditions. Suppose it 
takes five minutes for the person to adapt himself to the learning of 
his material. If he spends only fifteen minutes in the learning one 
third of the time will be under conditions not at all advantageous; if he 
spends thirty minutes, only one sixth of the time will be given to the 
warming up; while if he spends an hour, only one twelfth of the time 
will be so consumed. Another reason why breaking the periods of 
learning up into small sections may be disadvantageous lies in the fact 
that with material of considerable length brief periods do not give the 
opportunity for thoroughly comprehending the nature of what is being 
learned. Inother words, sufficient time is not allowed for “ orientation.” 
While, then, no absolute rule can be laid down as to the 
desirability of splitting the work up into many or few peri- 
ods, it may be a safe principle to follow that for pjistriputed 
material of considerable length a number of learning better than 
divisions is desirable. With persons whose at- ¢oncen- 
tention is readily adaptable and who lose little ‘ated. 
in the warming up process, the number of periods of learn- 
ing a given amount of material should be greater than 
with those whose attention adapts itself but slowly. Fur- 
ther, with young children the number of sittings should 
be greater than with older pupils and adults. 
In an experiment recently conducted in two of the grade schools of 
Champaign, Illinois, with pupils ranging from about eight to thirteen 
‘years, it was found that in learning a series of twelve nonsense syllables, 
it made absolutely no difference whether they were all learned at once 
or divided into two or four periods of learning, with considerable inter- 
vals of time between the periods. Probably, if the length of the ma- 
terial had been greatly increased, the results would have shown the 
learning at several sittings rather than at one more advantageous,
-P-A-G-E-188
164 The Learning Process | 
while, on the other hand, if the memory material had been less in 
length, the opposite results would have been secured. 
There is, doubtless, for every subject in the school cur- 
riculum an optimal distribution of periods of learning, de- 
secs pending upon the amount to be learned, the 
periods of nature of the material, and the age of the pupil. 
Peed This optimal period can be exactly determined 
geousfor in any individual instant only by observation 
children. and experiment, yet there are certain general 
methods of procedure in regard to distribution which can 
be safely laid down in the light of experiments already 
conducted. For the youngest children it is probably 
better to have any subject gives two periods a day, one in 
the morning and the other in the afternoon, than to have 
it grouped under one period. For older pupils very brief 
periods are not so advantageous, since these pupils are 
more capable of sustained attention and interest, and since 
by longer periods of study they get a better grasp of the 
subject as a whole. Obviously, it would be unwise for the 
mature student to break his intellectual work up into brief 
periods, for example, of fifteen or even thirty minutes 
each, particularly if it took him some time to get his at- 
tention fully centered on his subject. On the other hand, 
the average adult would accomplish more by spending two 
two-hour periods on a subject with an interval of twenty- 
four hours between, than he would in spending four hours 
consecutively.

recall is always an aid in the learning process, and that 
the recall should be interspersed in the learning; in other 
words, that during the study of the material the student 
should, from time to time, turn away from the work and 
attempt in visual or other imagery to recall it to his mind. 
This recall should not only be the reimaging of the mate- 
rial, but it should also be the reinstatement of the material 
in terms of its general meaning. Probably for significant 
material more than half the time should be spent on the 
recall. Recall is particularly valuableAbecause it enables 
the pupil to discover his errors and correct indefinite and 
hazy impressions. He holds himself to a more strict ac- 
count in recall than he does in memorization with the 
material directly before him. 
The fact that recall is of such great importance in learn- 
ing has a significant bearing on the nature of the recita- 
tion. The recitation is one of the most valuable ,.. i

determining what the pupil knows, in order to assign to 
him proper grades in his work. Its principal function, 
when skillfully conducted, is that it serves to recall to him 
the places where his knowledge is inexact, hazy, and un- 
certain, and it should always be followed on the part of 
the pupil by a relearning in the light of his previous errors. 
If the teacher regards the recitation from this point of 
view, # becomes the central factor in the whole scheme 
of primary and secondary education. The fact that the 
recitation as such is largely ignored in higher grades of 
instruction is, doubtless, a serious pedagogical defect, which 
can be remedied only by accustoming the student to prac- 
tice on his own initiative recall in his learning. This is

all the more important because of the fact that in the 
higher branches of learning so much less depends upon 
verbal memorization than it does in the lower branches. 
Significant material can be comprehended only by working 
zt over through recall and by reconstructing the printed page 
in terms of the student's own thought processes.

studies the memory material which he is trying to master

other conditions, physical and mental. It, however, holds 
generally true that for the preliminary orientation of the 
material to be learned the rate should be not as rapid as 
for later learning. It is obvious that when the nature of 
the material is more or less unknown, it is desirable to 
first proceed slowly, so that no mistakes shall be made in 
apprehending it, either in its detailed parts or its general 
meaning. When, however, it has become more or less 
familiar, the rate of learning should be increased. It is 
further true that for children the tempo should not be as 
rapid as for adults. The character of the material and 
the aim of the learning will also determine in a measure, 
the rate, as has been said above. If a poem is to be 
Tearned by heart for exact reproduction, then the tempo 
should be much slower than if material is to be mastered 
which requires not accurate reproduction, but rather re- 
production in terms of its general significance. It is also 
important to learn for permanent retention in a less hasty 
manner than for immediate reproduction withaut perma- 
nent retention. 
Meumann is the authority for the statement that in general the indi- 
vidual who learns at a slow rate is apt to retain what he learns better than 
the individual who learns at a rapid rate. This, however, holds good
-P-A-G-E-191
  
  Economy in Memory and Association eer 
only for individuals of average intelligence. The person of extremely 
acute intelligence probably as a rule learns more rapidly, and at the 
same time has greater retentivity, while the subnormal individual learns 
with extreme slowness, and at the same time his memory is poor. It is, 
without doubt, desirable to accustom the unusually rapid learner, who is 
at the same time not likely to retain well what he has learned, to a slower 
tempo. It is also well to accustom the pupil to read certain materials 
rapidly. This applies to those facts of which he needs to get only a 
general idea, and the details of which he need not carry in his memory 
even for the shortest time. A person who reads widely must learn the 
art of varying his tempo to suit the material in hand, skipping rapidly 
over the unessentials, and proceeding slowly when he comes to those 
parts which require special attention and which are for him signi- 
ficant. 
If material is to be retained for any length of time, a 
simple mastery of it for immediate recall is not sufficient. 
It should be learned far beyond the point of Learning 
immediate reproduction, if time and energy are to beyond the , <ok's threshold of 
be saved. For this reason it is often better to reproduc- 
concentrate study upon a single phase or 49. 
i of a lesson rather than to spread it over too wide 
a field. If this is done, then that which is learned can be 
kept in mind for subsequent recall after the learning period 
is ended. On the other hand, if the subject is learned only 
so that it can be just recalled at the end of the learning 
period, it will rapidly fade from the memory, and cannot be 
worked over again during the intervals between study. 
The advantage of learning in the way advocated above, 
however, depends largely upon the ability and willingness 
of the learner to practice recall between the periods of 
learning. If the pupil in the common schools and the 
student in the higher institutions of learning would make 
it a practice to recall immediately after study, and at inter- 
vals until the next period of study, the materials which they 
are to master, they would find it surprisingly economical. 
In discussing the question of economical learning, the 
problem arises whether it is better to learn material through 
one of the avenues of the senses alone or by aid of the sev-

eral senses. For example, if the pupil is learning to spell 
a list of words, should he, while studying them, pronounce. 
Aids in them (aloud or in a whisper), and write them? 
learning. A considerable amount of experimental evidence 
has been obtained on this point. Investigations made by 
various German experimentalists! seem to indicate that 
vocalization is a decided aid in the learning. 
Lay found that words seen and copied simultaneously by pupils were 
learned the most readily, and that words seen and pronounced aloud 
stood second, while at the bottom of the list in ease of learning were those 
words which were simply heard. Fuchs and Haggenmiiller (“ Studien 
und Versuche tiber die Erlernung der Orthographie,” Schzller’s Samm- 
lung u. s. w., Il. Bd., 4H.) also, found that words seen and copied 
simultaneously by pupils were the most readily learned, and that, in 
general, vocalization was a decided aid. Itschner? found that words 
seen and pronounced aloud were the best learned, and that those seen and 
copied simultaneously stood second. 
A series of experiments recently concluded by the Department of 
Psychology at the University of Illinois, in which about eighty school 
children were tested, seems definitely to show that learning for all grades 
is considerably facilitated by allowing the pupils to study in a whisper. 
On the other hand, learning by writing the word seen is a marked hin- 
drance. This latter fact has been confirmed by other and more extensive 
experiments carried on with pupils in the cities of Urbana, Bloomington, 
and Danville. Writing seems to be a hindrance to learning up to the 
sixth grade. The reason for this is to be found in the fact that the pro- 
cess of forming the letters involved in writing has not become mechanized 
sufficiently in the earlier grades to allow the pupils to use it without 
concentrating their attention upon the effort expended in forming the 
letters. 
Writing, therefore, should never be used with younger 
children as an aid in memorization. It seems positively to 
be a distraction. In general the rule should be laid down 
_ that in learning, all those aids that do not mutually inhibit 
each other or distract the attention from the main purpose 
of learning can be employed to advantage. There seems

to be no doubt that rhythm is a decided aid in learning, 
and it may be used legitimately in school practice when 
the memory material is to be mastered in a mechanical 
way. For certain kinds of memory material it is probably 
advantageous to have the children recite in concert in 
rhythmical form. Experiments at the University of IIli- 
nois have shown that one of the greatest distractions in 
learning is requiring children, especially those in the lower 
grades, to keep perfectly quiet. It was found that when 
the pupils were asked to sit in their seats with hands 
folded, their memorization of nonsense syllables was much 
inferior to their memorization when they were allowed to 
move about in their seats and to gesticulate. 
In the presentation of material for learning, the question 
arises as to whether the visual or auditory method is 
better. Perhaps no final answer can be given yo ang 
to this question. It is true, however, that in auditory 
general visually presented material possesses Present® 
the advantage of greater clearness (especially 
with unfamiliar words or words difficult to spell), than does 
orally presented material. On the other hand, orally 
presented material is better suited to securing attention of 
young children. It is the more natural and primitive mode 
of presentation. In teaching the child to read it isa great 
mistake to rely entirely on the visual symbols. The words 
should not merely be seen by the pupil; they should in 
addition be carefully pronounced both by pupil and teacher, 
and broken up into their syllables. J/¢ zs clearly unpsycho- 
logical to teach the children to read by having them grasp 
whole sentences or even phrases and long words in purely 
visual terms. While there seem to be great individual 
differences among pupils in this matter, and while for some 
the visual method alone may be fairly satisfactory, for 
children in groups it will be found that many are seriously 
handicapped if their instruction in reading is without 
auditory presentation and is unaccompanied by a careful

indication of how the words are to be pronounced. In 
learning to spell the conditions are somewhat similar. 
In an investigation in the psychological laboratory of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois concerning the factors involved in spelling} it was found 
for the adults tested that it was important to present the words to be 
learned in such a way as to facilitate the visual perception as much as 
_ possible, but that also for certain of the subjects the indication of the 
pronunciation was an aid in learning. It was further found “that the 
observers combining the letters at once into syllables as they are pre- 
sented is of prime significance.” For one of the observers it was found 
that vocalization was absolutely necessary for the recognition. of words. 
The vocalization of syllables appeared to be an aid in all cases. Vocal- 
ization of letters, however, was sometimes a hindrance. 
It seems evident that in learning to spell and to read, 
neither visual nor auditory methods of learning and recall 
should be exclusively relied on, but there should be an appear 
to.both these channels of memorization. 
When we consider the matter of children’s compositions 
in the grades, we find, especially with younger children, a 
Oraland  CoNMsiderable superiority in the oral as compared 
written with the written work. In the oral work the 
= child has greater freedom and _ spontaneity, 
while in the written work he is held down more to the 
form of presentation, and gives less attention, consequently, 
to the substance. While written work is to be insisted on 
to cultivate accuracy and formal correctness, it is not 
likely to stimulate inventive ability. School instruction 
in composition has confined itself very largely to consider- 
ations of grammatical and rhetorical accuracy. While 
accuracy must be insisted on, it must be remembered that 
the form of the expression has but little value unless the 
thought in which the form is expressed is worth while. 
Children should be encouraged to create, as well as to 
present accurately what they have created. In the grades 
written composition should not be employed to any great

extent when the purpose is to encourage the child in in- 
vention. It is much better to have him first tell before the 
class the story that he is composing, and then perhaps 
later to reduce it to written form. che 
When the learning progresses economically, it passes} 
through certain definite stages to aconclusion. Meumann 
has pointed out four such stages, namely, Pm: ; s 4 : : ages in 
(1) adaptation and orientation; (2) passive the jearning 
learning; (3) active control of the learning ProCes® |{ 3 
through direction of the associations; (4) general revicw 
and final synthesis. y 
= 
In the first stage, the attention is adjusted to the material, and its 
general nature is discovered; in the second stage the learning proceeds 
objectively, the various parts being impressed upon the mind with the 
learner in the attitude of receptivity; in the third stage the learner 
actively directs his manner of learning and seeks to form helpful asso- 
ciations. In this stage, if he is not learning for reproduction of the 
material verbatim, but for general meaning and significance, he deter- 
mines what part of the material is to be particularly emphasized, and 
what part is to be passed over with relatively slight attention. In this 
phase of the learning, it is the business of the teacher to direct the 
immature pupils to select and properly arrange the important elements 
to be learned. Older pupils and adults must learn to make this selec- 
tion themselves, if they are to succeed in any real way in mastering the 
more complex and difficult memory material. In the fourth stage, the 
entire material to be memorized is to be carefully gone over, the salient 
points are to be emphasized, and the whole is finally to be worked over 
and associated in meaningful ways. In slipshod learning the pupil 
too often relies chiefly on the methods of the second stage, namely, 
those of passive learning. He does not take the trouble to ascertain 
exactly the nature of the material to be learned, and he never rises to 
the plane of actively directing his-associations, nor of reviewing and 
unifying his work. 
It ts extremely important that the teacher should insist that 
the pupil observe all these stages in the learning of the 
various subjects of the school curriculum. The method of 
approaching the material to be learned and the way of 
mastering it cannot be left to chance, if economy in time

and energy is to be considered an important factor in the 
learning process. | | 
The numerous investigations concerning the psychology 
of memory all emphasize the fact that meaningful material 
is immensely superior to meaningless material Material ; ‘ ; 15 lk 
Sail in the ease with which it is learned. Sense 
must be material can be learned from ten to fifteen times meaningful. 
more rapidly, and also can be retained much 
better, than nonsense material. The practical significance 
of this fact is, that the material to be learned should be 
made as meaningful as possible. Some hold it desir- 
able for this reason that when material has but little 
significance for the pupil he should memorize it with cer- 
tain mnemonic aids. This would apply to learning of 
rules, lists of words, and the like. However, as has already 
been said, there is no excuse for learning anything which 
cannot be used in meaningful ways; therefore, that which 
is at first mastered by tricks of memory must be later 
comprehended, else the learning is worse than useless. It 
also is to be remembered that great care should be taken, 
when mnemonic aids are used, that they are employed 
only where the material cannot be learned through mean- 
ingful associations that inhere in the nature of the material. 
Any mnemonic system which attempts to facilitate memory 
has decided disadvantages when this material is to be re- 
cast in meaningful relations. The bonds of association 
formed by these artificial methods must ultimately be de- 
stroyed and new bonds of association substituted. 
An example may make this fact more definite. It is possible for the 
child who is learning about some American or English author to commit 
to memory his works by ingeniously arranging them so that the initial 
letters shall spell a word or phrase. Doubtless, in the first instance, 
the mnemonic device greatly facilitates the memorization. However, 
later on,‘the pupil, if he is to understand the real significance of what 
the author has written, must arrange his works, not in ternis of this 
mnemonic system by which he has originally learned them, but in 
terms of the significance which they have in the literary development of
-P-A-G-E-197
  Economy in Memory and Association 173 
the writer. Obviously, the first series of associations that he has formed 
under the artificial arrangement of his mnemonic device must be broken 
down and a new system substituted. If the old arrangement, however, 
has been one of long standing, it is difficult to destroy it and set up the 
newer and more rational one. It is for this reason a safe rule to follow 
that mnemonic devices should never be used except in cases of absolute 
necessity, and that the pupil should never be encouraged to rely, to any 
considerable extent, upon memory tricks of this kind. 
The following rules of pedagogical procedure may be 
deduced from the preceding discussion : — 
(1) In considering memory in the school work the teacher 
must recognize that it is broader than definite recollections 
of previous experiences. He isto keep inmind y,, 
the fact that not only that which can be clearly verbatim 
reproduced, but also much of that which, as dis- ™°™" 
tinct recollection, has entirely faded from the mind, is of 
the greatest importance in the progress of the pupil. He 
is also to remember that there is not one way, but there 
are many ways of testing mem and that different tests 
should be employed for different school subjects, for differ- | 
ent materials, and for different purposes. The test so 
often used of merely reproducing verbatim what has been 
mechanically learned is perhaps on the whole the most 
unsatisfactory test. This is the test that is too often solely 
employed in written and oral examinations. While it has 
a place in the school work of all grades, it should not, 
especially in the higher grades, occupy a position of exclu- 
sive or chief importance. 
(2) Since the factor of impression seems to be relatively 
more important in the lower grades than in the higher, and 
since this factor is more important in mechanical uM ; ‘ ere ; echanical 
than in significant learning, and since further memoriza- 
the stability of memory seems to suffer a tem- ‘i ieee 
porary upheaval about the time of the pupil’s adolescent 
entrancé into the high school, the grades should ¥°** 
be the place for mechanical memorization and drill in the 
Jundamentals that form the basis of broader education. It
-P-A-G-E-198
x 
  174 The Learning Process 
is a mistake, however, to suppose that mere retentivity is 
greater among children than among more advanced pupils. 
The fact is that mechanical memory occupies a more im- 
portant place than does systematic memory in the earlier 
grades, simply because of its relative, not its absolute 
value. ‘However, since the older pupils are less willing to 
submit to the drudgery of drill than are the younger, it is 
a pedagogical maxim, safe to follow, that drill and mechan- 
ical memorization belong chiefly to the preadolescent years. 
(3) It has already been pointed out that it is advanta- 
geous to learn materia by the whole rather than by the part 
method, within certain limits) Further, it seems 
eee desirable to distribute the learning of a lengthy 
economical piece of memory material over several sittings. learning. ‘ ; 
It also seems to be desirable to learn material 
sufficiently well so that later learning of other material 
shall not break up the associations first formed through 
retroactive inhibition. These various rules for economical 
learning, however, seem to conflict with each other at cer- 
tain points. If the pupil learns by the whole method, 
spending a certain amount of time at each learning, he | 
will raise fewer associations above the threshold of memory 
than if he learns by the part method; therefore, there is 
greater danger of retroactive inhibition than if he should 
learn a part of the material sufficiently well to establish 
firm bonds of association. The further fact that the mate- 
rial should be memorized, not at one, but at various sittings, 
seems to enter into conflict with the principle of learning 
the material sufficiently well to avoid the effect of retroac- 
tive inhibition. These difficulties may, however, in part 
be overcome by following a compromise method. This 
may be stated as follows: Select material of reasonable

young child is implicit obedience, so the chief mental training from about 
eight to twelve is arbitrary memorization, drill, habituation, with only limited 
appeal to the understanding.”

length for one period of study; go over it carefully and 
slowly for purposes of orientation ; repeat this until the 
general nature of the material is clearly understood, then 
increase the tempo. Continue to learn by the whole method 
until the majority of the material is raised above the thresh- 
old of memory. Next, strengthen the weak associations 
(z.e. those not raised above the threshold of memory); 
then go over the whole again until it is fixed. It is de- 
sirable to raise all the elements considerably beyond the 
threshold of memory. During the learning period practice 
recall; also, allow several minutes after the actual learning 
is finished for recalling and fixing the associations already 
formed. This will be found to be one of the most impor- 
tant methods of firmly establishing the material in memory. 
Relearn the material on several succeeding days until it is 
thoroughly mastered. 
(4) The school program should be so arranged that sub- 
jects should be continued over a considerable period. It is 
probably better, for example, to have the course in he school 
algebra in the high school extend over two years Program 
with thirty-minute periods each day than to ex- — 
tend over a year and a half, as is at present the “bunched.” 
custom, with forty-five-minute daily periods. What is true 
of algebra is, doubtless, true of a considerable number of 
other subjects in the secondary school curriculum. Jn gen- 
eral, the work on a school subject should not be “ bunched,” 
but should be spread over a sufficient period to allow the ma- 
terials to be properly worked over and comprehended by the 
pupils. In the work of college and. university grade 
the student, in electing subjects, should, for the most part, 
select those that continue for some years in his course. It 
is better to select a subject reciting three times a week for 
two years, than one reciting six times a week for one year. | 
(5) Too many short courses are undesirable. Those sub- 
jects that have been put into the grades and the secondary 
schools to “enrich” the curriculum are oftentimes to be

(6) Much has been said in recent years against the 
desirability of examinations at the end of courses of study. 
The value Oe Value of the examination does not consist 
of examina- primarily in its worth as a test for determining 
_— the pupil’s knowledge. Its chief service lies in 
the fact that it compels the person who is to be examined 
to carry over a considerable period the details of the sub- 
ject which he is pursuing. The tendency too often is to 
let a subject drop out of mind as soon as it is no longer re- 
quired in the school course. If the test of the work done 
by the pupil were made by determining his knowledge only 
at the end of each day’s study, in many subjects he could 
make little advance. Only in those subjects like foreign 
language and mathematics, in which each day’s work pre- 
supposes practically all that has preceded, would such a 
course be at all safe. In the higher work particularly, the 
English system of determining the knowledge of the stu- 
dent by examinations covering the study of several years has 
decided advantages over that employedin American colleges 
and universities. / the elementary and secondary schools, 
examinations, not as tests, but as incentives for keeping in 
mind the work that has been pursued over an extended pe- 
riod, should be emphasized more than they are at present. 
/ 
In the eighties in various New England colleges, it was the practice 
to hold examinations at the end of the sophomore and the senior years, 
covering in each instance the work of the two preceding years. The 
introduction of the elective system, together with other causes, resulted 
in the abandonment of this excellent practice.
-P-A-G-E-201
  
  Economy in Memory and Association 174 
It may be seriously questioned whether the almost universal tendency 
to give up the college entrance examination is altogether an advantage. 
In the East the student 1s generally admitted to college by certificate ; 
while in the Middle West the method of inspection and approval of 
secondary schools allows the student to enter a higher institution with- 
out being called to account at all for the work he has previously done. 
Under such conditions as these he has no incentive to carry a study in 
mind after he has finished it. The partial introduction of the elective 
system into the secondary school, with the increased opportunity ot 
taking short and often unrelated courses, adds to the danger in this 
direction.

possible, both visually and orally. The advantage of oral

Further, visual presentation can be both succes- oral presen- 
sive and simultaneous (z.e. several words or many “*"°™ 
can be presented at the same time), while auditory presen.

in instructing the pupil in material presented visually : 
this visual presentation should be supplemented whenever 
possible by the teacher or pupil reading aloud the material 
for study. For example, the geography or the history

better still, various pupils should be called upon to read

should rather instruct the pupil as to the method of dis-

if it is necessary for the teacher to do this work at the out- 
set, he should not continue it any longer than is absolutely 
necessary, for the chief value in forming purposive associa- 
tions lies in the fact that they are purposive for the one who 
so forms them, and are not imposed from the outside. 
Gradually, at least, as the pupil becomes more mature, he 
should be more and more capable of forming the proper 
associations through his own initiative.!

the most serious results of the attack on the possibilities

lief that it is impossible to instruct the pupil in anything 
but the content of his school subjects.

THE APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY OF MEMORY AND ASSO-« 
CIATION 
THE purpose of _applied_psycholegy, which is now rap- 
idly developing, particularly in Germany and France, is 
to gather such psychological information as will 
“serve various Sciences in ‘their_practical applica- ade eet ee eer

In education, in particular, applied psychology shows 
many interesting facts that are of no small importance in. 
throwing light upon the fundamental processes of memory 
and association. Applied psychology attempts to discover 
an exact method for evaluating the workings of human 
consciousness in the practical affairs of these three profes- 
sions; it further seeks to devise methods of control in di- 
recting human conduct, in so far as it expresses itself in 
these three fields. 
For a long time French psychologists have used their knowledge of 
the facts of mind in their treatment of mental disease; in the cure of 
alcoholism and the like. Indeed, under Janet and others, French psy- 
chology has interpreted normal mind largely from the standpoint of the 
psychological clinic. This has also been true, to some extent, of Ger- 
man, English, and American psychologists. Criminal psychology has 
received a considerable impetus of late years through the elaboration of 
the methods of Kraepelin, Jung, Riklin, and others, and has become 
known in America, to the general public principally through the books 
and magazine articles of Miinsterberg.! 
Less striking, but not less important, than the work in 
mental pathology and criminology have been the investi-

gations of educational problems and practice. America, 
under the leadership of G. Stanley Hall, has for thirty years 
been in the van of progress in educational psychology.. 
We have but to recall the rapid growth of the Child Study Move- 
ment during this period as it has developed under the impetus given it 
at Clark University,! to recognize how much America has done: to ad- 
vance our knowledge of the mind of the child, particularly the child in 
the school. More recently German investigators have seriously taken up 
work in this field of applied psychology with the determination and pa- 
tience characteristic of them. Meumann, whose investigations and con- 
clusions have often been cited in the preceding pages, is one of the chief 
experimentalists who has given his attention to this phase of applied 
psychology. 
William Stern, professor at the University of Breslau, 
has in the last few years, been a leader in the movement 
ie cer of applied psychology, particularly in its educa- 
chology of tional aspects. Stern’s chief work has been in 
testimony. the psychology of testimony, and his investiga- 
tions have brought out facts important to law and educa- 
tion alike. The purpose of Stern’s experimentation has 
been to find out the extent and accuracy of testimony in 
children and adults. 
The materials that he has used for his investigations are of two kinds. 
His principal material has consisted of colored pictures of homely scenes, 
familiar in their nature to German children and adults. Stern’s most 
commonly used picture is the so-called “Peasant’s Room” (Bauer- 
stube).2 It represents a room containing a bed, chairs, stools, a table, a 
cradle, and various articles on the walls. At the table a man and a boy 
are seated, eating, and by the table is standing a woman, who seems to 
be serving the man. There are dishes on the table, and a vacant chair 
at the side of the table for the woman. In the cradle there is a baby, 
with a doll on the floor and a dog near by. On the walls are a clock 
and three pictures. At the single window is a curtain and a shade; on 
the window sill is a plant. Through the window may be seen the foli- 
age ofa tree. The various objects in the picture are colored. Beside 
1The articles that have appeared in the Pedagogical Seminary record the 
principal work of Hall and his pupils. 
2 This picture is found in the first volume of Stern’s Bettrage zur Psychologie 
der Aussage, p. 418. (Leipzig, 1903-1904.)
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Applied Psychology of Memory and Association 181 
the picture experiment, Stern also used later a so-called event experi: 
ment, which had been arranged beforehand. The event experiment 
consists essentially in a person doing a certain number of definitely pre- 
arranged things before witnesses, who afterwards are to report as to the 
exact nature of what was done. The value of these two experiments is 
not thesame. The picture is better for the comparison of the testimony 
with facts ; the event comes nearer to fulfilling the actual conditions of life. 
The value of both could be combined in the use of the moving picture. 
Beside the picture test and the event test a-rumor test has also been ar- 
ranged, for the purpose of comparing hearsay evidence with the report 
of an eye witness. In the rumor test a statement is made which is re- 
peated by various individuals, and the final statement is compared with 
the original.* 
The results of these various tests are brought together 
under two forms, termed by Whipple the narrative and 
the interrogatory. The person tested is required in the 
picture experiment to carefully study the picture, generally 
about a minute, and then he is asked immediately to give 
an account, either orally or in writing, of what the picture 
contains. This narrative is supplemented by a series of 
questions (the interrogatory). These have been for the 
most part carefully prearranged. The replies to the inter- 
rogatory are technically known as the deposition. 
The forms in which the questions are asked the witness 
are extremely important in arriving at the truth of his report. 
If the questions are put in such a way as to pre- phe man- 
suppose a certain answer, this answer is likely to nerof ‘ ° ° questioning 
be given, although it may be quite contrary tothe a witness 
truth. The obtaining of false testimony, especi- ‘portant. 
ally from young children, through suggestive questions, con- 
stitutes one of the chief dangers of the reports of children. 
A skilled questioner may by the mere form of his interroga-

Binet, Borst, Claparéde, Lipmann, Lobsien, and Wreschner. A description of 
the tests employed, together with a careful bibliography, is to be found in Whip- 
ple’s “ Manual of Mental and Physical Tests” and also in an article by the 
same writer in the Psychological Bulletin, V1, pp. 153-170, May, 1909, under 
the title of the “ Observer as Reporter: A Survey of the Psychology of Testi 
mony.”
-P-A-G-E-206
  182 The Learning Process 
tories entirely obscure the truth of a deposition. It has been 
found by experiment that questions that presuppose yes or 
no are more strongly suggestive than questions that contain 
no such presupposition. For example, the question, “‘ Has 
the man a spoon in his hand,” is much more strongly sugges- 
tive than the inquiry, “‘ What has he in his hand?” The 
most dangerous questions in the falsification of testimony 
are those in which an answer is assumed in the question 
itself, particularly when the implied answer contains a pre- 
sumption contrary to fact. For example, the witness is 
asked, ‘‘How many drawers has the cupboard?” (there 
is no cupboard in the picture). It has been found that 
questions suggesting false replies are more likely to deceive 
the witness when they are preceded by questions contain- 
ing suggestions that are true. The skillful questioner who 
wishes to falsify testimony will, therefore, only occasionally 
introduce a falsely suggestive question. A large amount 
of questioning will be suggestive of correct answers. It is 
further to be remembered that the personality of the 
questioner is a very important element in the suggestion. 
The suggestibility is greatly increased when the witness 
has a feeling of respect for the questioner, or a desire to 
please and to appear at an advantage. This is particularly 
true in the case of children.} 
There are various degrees of certainty in the replies 
which the witness makes in response to the interrogatory. 
Degrees of The least degree is that in which the witness 
oe risks neither affirmation nor denial. He replies 
of a wit- that the details about which questions are asked 
are may be true or they may not. The next grade 
of certainty is that in which the witness merely admits 
that a certain statement of facts may be true. He thinks 
it is possible. In the third stage of certainty the witness

by Livmann, in the Zeitschrift fiir angewandte Psychologie, Vol. 1, 1907-1908, 
PP: 44-92, 352-415, 504-54.
-P-A-G-E-207
  The Applied Psychology of Memory and Association 183 
  believes that the statement is true; he says that it is prob- 
ably correct. In the fourth grade of certainty the witness 
is sure that the statement is true, while in the final and 
highest grade he is willing to swear that the statement is 
true. 
Error in a report of a witness may arise either in the 
direct report or in his replies to the questions prrors in 
of the examiner. Stern! has classified these the direct 
errors as follows: — ae 
(1) Errors of apprehension, due to overlooking some of the elements 
presented ; misapprehensions that arise in consequence of expectation 
or habituation. These include the two sources of illusion outlined by 
James and discussed on p. 91. (2) Errors of memory as such that 
arise through the filling up of gaps in accordance with habit. In this 
form of error only a part of the event was actually experienced, and the 
rest is supplied in accordance with previous experiences. Errors of 
memory also arise from the using of verbal expressions in an altered 
sense when different accounts of the same event are given at various 
times after the happening (for example, the statement “The man’s shoes 
were polished,” made in an early report, might be changed in a 
later report to the statement that the man had a polished manner). 
Errors in memory are also due to the growth of the idea in various suc- 
ceeding reports (for example, in the first report the witness stated, 
“There were two trees” ; a week later, “a grove”; still later, “a 
forest”). (3) Errors of phantasy. These include the retouching of 
the recollections, the unintentional blending of the imagined with the 
experienced, and the confusion of experiences of different times. In this 
class of errors are to be found the mythopeeic fancies of children and 
the “fish stories” of adults. (4) Lack of will. The witness has too 
great credulity. He subjects his knowledge to.too little criticism, par- 
ticularly in dealing with uncertain recollections. He will not attend 
sufficiently to get a clear apprehension of the facts. 
The sources of error in the interrogatory are , 
much greater than in the direct narrative. While the inter- 
nan’ s rogatory questioning may be an excellent means of filling gtabtes thks 
in the gaps of the spontaneous report, it is a in the 
constant source of error and falsification. For ™™**"

the child, the uneducated, and the subnormal person, the 
questions put by a skilled examiner act as an imperative, 
that is, they demand the answer whichthey suggest. The 
witness has generally exhausted in his narrative his stock 
of clear ideas and is compelled to hunt among the remain- 
ing indistinct and fragmentary recollections for materials 
with which to meet the questions asked him.* 
Among other sources of error in the report of a witness are 
hearsay statements, reading about the occurrence and dis- 
cussing it with others who have also witnessedit. Although 
hearsay testimony is excluded from the courts, it plays a very 
large part in the statements of everyday life. Further, 
much which the witness believes that he is telling from his 
own actual experience is due to redding unverified reports 
and to conversations with others. It is often impossible 
for him, especially if the event is remote in time, to be sure 
of the part that has been actually experienced by him and 
that which has come to him by some indirect means.

The chief single result of the psychology of testimony is 
that an errorless report is not the rule, but the exception, 
even when the report is made by a competent observer un- 
der favorable conditions. Errorless reports are commonly 
characterized by a very small range, z.e. they are the 
reports of individuals who are extremely cautious and who 
state only what they are certain of.

port and its accuracy, though fora given reporter it is 
doubtless true that they stand in an inverse relation. In

report, and hence covers a large number of details in his 
narrative with a high degree of accuracy ; the other is cau- 
tious, and therefore restricts his range, which may not, 
under any circumstances, be extensive. 
It is generally true that sworn testimony is more accu- 
rate than unsworn, although absolute certainty is no sure 
evidence of accuracy. A number of tests at the gyorn testi- 
University of Illinois showed that witnesses mony more 
were willing to swear to statements which were ot sh 
absolutely untrue, although in general they were SWor- 
more cautious when asked whether they would be willing to 
swear to the statement that they had made. 
Stern is o opinion that in gener are more

gators have denied that there are such Sex Reports of 
differences. The reports of children are uni- children 
formly inferior to those of adults. The extent thn alt 
covered is not great, the errorsare numerous, but #@4dults. 
at the same time the certainty is marked. Between the 
ages of seven and eighteen the extent of the report increases 
rapidly. Although the accuracy increases at the same 
time, it does not grow with such rapidity as does the range. 
The one factor that is particularly responsible for the 
inferior reports of children is their excessive suggestibility, 
particularly in the preadolescent years. A considerable 
number of investigators have tested the suggestibility of 
school children, with rather surprising results. They all 
point to the fact that children up to the age of twelve or 
thirteen years can easily be made, through suggestion, to 
give reports and make judgments that are quite at variance

with facts. Stern has found four different stages in the 
development of the child’s capacity to report what he has 
experienced. Very young children enumerate only isolated 
objects or persons. A little later, about the eighth year, 
they report actions more carefully ; but they first pay atten- 
tion to relationships, spatial, temporal, and causal, at about 
the tenth year. Later still, there appears the capacity to 
describe the qualities of the objects concerning which they 
make their report.

mea intelligence, but who possess a vivid imagi- 
andaccu- nation, and are not accurate in their obser- 
a vations, are likely to give very unreliable 
reports, while, on the other hand, it is possible to find 
dull but careful observers whose range of testimony is 
slight, but whose correctness is great. Defectives of all 
sorts show a high degree of inaccuracy, and are highly 
suggestible.

When the account of a given experience is transmitted

the effect is to produce on the one hand

According to the evidence so far obtained from the 
experiments in the psychology of testimony, brief durations 
of time are strongly overestimated. Periods Accuracy of 
of from one to two minutes seem much longer estimating 
than they really are, while from ten minutes on onic of 
there appears to be a slowly increasing tendency 
to underestimation. Stern concludes that for objects of 
average dimensions, windows, blackboards, and so forth, 
the size is fairly well estimated. Smaller objects, e.g. 
a book, are somewhat overestimated. Larger dimensions, 
for example, a corridor, are again underestimated, but 
still larger ones, for example, a road, are generally over- 
estimated.

report several times, the effect of this repetition is complex, 
for in the first place it tends, in part, to estab- peects of

- in the later reports, because these are based more upon the 
memory of the verbal statements of the earlier reports 
than upon the original experience itself. It thus happens 
often that those statements in the earlier reports which 
were affirmed only with a slight degree of certainty later 
are taken to be true beyond any doubt. All false state- 
ments are given thus an added appearance of truth. In 
the later reports it becomes very difficult to distinguish 
 
-P-A-G-E-212

between those phases which actually took place and those 
which were merely reported as having occurred. This 
illusion of memory makes it difficult for the individual to 
tell with certainty whether the supposed experiences of 
early childhood are- actually recalled by him or whether 
they have been told to him by others. 
The simple practice of reporting, even without special 
training or conscious effort to improve, facilitates better 
The effect Ueports. There is improvement in range and 
of practice. accuracy and in the assurance of the reporter 
that is warranted by the facts. Similar practice effects 
may be observed in the increased accuracy of replies to 
questions. The capacity of children to observe and report 
in a detailed and accurate manner may be improved by 
systematic training. This education may best be secured 
by an appeal to the interest and enthusiasm or the desire 
for improvement on the part of the child; more formal 
training of an intellectual type, ¢.g. suggestions for sys- 
tematic observations, specific training in sense perception, 
and so forth are much less effective. 1 
Whipple concludes, “The inadequacy of the child’s re- 
port is due not so much to poor memory as to the fact that

fact that he is absurdly uncritical (his assurance, 
indeed, commonly reaches one hundred per cent). The 
education of the child in observation and report must, 
therefore, be directed in part to puncturing this bubble of 
unhesitating confidence and faith in his capacity to give 
unerring reports. .. . A witness whose testimony is poor 
because of his lack of judgment and proper caution may 
be trained by showing him how many and what kind of 
errors he commits; but a witness whose testimony is poor

indeed, this defect can really be repaired at all by educa. 
tive measures.” 3 
The practical consequences of the investigations con- 
cerning the psychology of testimony may be summarized - 
as follows.1_ There is no testimony concerning gtatements > 
facts.or reports of events that can be relied on of children 
in every particular. This is true to an extent ae 
with adults, but more particularly true in regard "critically. 
to children. Hence, statements of children in the home or 
in the school must not be accepted uncritically. If the 
child is discovered in a statement that is not in accord with 
the facts, it cannot, however, be assumed in all instances 
that he is telling an intentional lie. 
Children’s false statements arise from various causes. 
As has already been seen, these statements are due in 
part to inadequate comprehension and to a misapprehen- 
sion of what they actually witness. Misstate- * ; statement 
ments are, however, more often to be ascribed false in one 
to the innate tendency of the child to exaggerate iy ee 
and to substitute unconsciously the products of rect in 
phantasy for objective reality. The bearing of 
this problem in the school work of the child has already 
been discussed in connection with the chapter on imagina- 
tion. The mistake is often made in assuming that because 
a certain statement is untrue in some of its aspects it is 
untrue in all. It often happens that a child may make a 
statement false in one particular that may be quite correct 
in others. It is, therefore, unwise to assume that the child 
is entirely mistaken in what he is reporting because he has 
been detected in a partial error. On the other hand, it 
very often happens that the child who gives the most accu- 
rate and careful statement in many particulars is abso- 
lutely unreliable in others. 
A large part of the falsification of a report is due to the 
questioning of the child, who is often. misled either by

desire to please the questioner. This latter tendency

the greatest of care not to ask leading or suggestive questions 
and in general to question only when there is an absolute need 
of zt. The child should be encouraged to tell a connected 
narrative as far as possible without being questioned. This 
applies in a measure to the method of school instruction. 
Perhaps in general there is a tendency on the part of the 
teacher to ask too many questions in conducting the recita- 
tion. When questions are asked, care should always be 
taken to make them as objective as possible, unless the 
teacher purposely desires to suggest an answer; and then 
' he must be certain just what form his suggestion should 
take, and frame his questions accordingly. The teacher 
should not make the mistake of assuming that he can by 
questioning children singly or in groups necessarily discover 
their attitude toward their school work or determine their 
preferences. Almost invariably the teacher, making such 
inquiries, suggests to the pupil the sort of answer that he ex- 
pects; and even if the questions themselves are not sug- 
gestive, the pupil tends to reply in a way which he thinks 
will please the teacher. For this reason a large amount 
of the data collected in regard to the preferences, interests, 
and ideals of children are to be taken with caution. Much 
of it is to be classed with the reply of a boy in a French 
school, who, when asked what book he most preferred, 
wrote: “I like my prayerbook best, for in it are nice 
prayers.” 
Since experiments have shown clearly that the accuracy 
and range of testimony may be greatly improved by train- 
ing, it should be one of the conscious aims of the instruc- 
tion in the school and of the training in the home to edu- 
cate the child in accurate observation and report. As 
a
-P-A-G-E-215
The Applied Psychology of Memory and Association 191 
Whipple has pointed out, this education is best secured by 
insisting on ideals of improvement, rather than attempting 
to formally discipline the child in methods of ob- 4. ig 
servation and perception. However, something should be 
may be done in this latter way. The insistence oe iP 
upon accuracy in reporting will stimulate the observation 
child in the direction of clearly separating the *"**°?°™ 
fantastic and the improbable from the real, and will bea 
wholesome corrective to the exuberance of imagination 
which may, especially in certain individuals, lead to such 
distortions and inaccuracies in learning as to ,seriously 
impair the value of instruction which the child receives in 
school and at home. 
In regard to the testimony of children in courts, the 
ordinary methods of examination should be to a large 
measure superseded by those better suited to 
bring out the truth. The juvenile criminal is ane een 
quite differently treated from the adult criminal peach 
in court procedure; in like manner the juvenile 
witness should be given special consideration. It is par- 
ticularly disastrous to have the child examined before a 
single questioner who is interested more in winning his 
case than in arriving at the truth. The questioning of 
children, and indeed of adults, should be conducted by an 
ex parte examination. Children should not be examined in 
open court, but rather in private by a psychological expert. 
Children, and adults as well, should be examined immediately 
after the event, if possible. The greater the interval be- 
tween the event and the report, the greater are the proba- 
bilities of the various falsifications of memory pointed out 
above. A large number of rehearsals of what the witness 
has experienced should be avoided, since such rehearsals 
have the tendency to fix the errors which appear in the 
earlier testimony. Further, if during these rehearsals the 
witness is questioned, the suggestions then received will add 
greatly to the unreliability of subsequent testimony. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
192 The Learning Process 
not too much to say that a child, under twelve years of 
age, who has been questioned a large number of times by 
interested persons concerning an event about which he is 
later to give testimony, is thereby precluded from a report 
that is sufficiently accurate to deserve credence. Stern 
advocates as a remedy for these difficulties “ the introduc- 
tion of special magistrates for juvenile witnesses, before 
whom the children should be examined but once, and then 
as soon as possible after the event.” Many misunder- 
standings arise between parents and teachers, because the 
former take too seriously the reports of children concerning 
the happenings in the school. They are not aware that 
even with the best of intentions the children are liable to 
give the most untrustworthy accounts of what really has 
taken place. It is especially important that the general 
facts in regard to the reports of children that have been 
discussed above should be emphasized in parents’ meetings 
and in similar gatherings.

This method is in essence an extremely simple i Jung’s ‘ . es ; experiment. 
one, and consists in giving the subject to be 
tested a list of perhaps a hundred words relating to the 
happenings in everyday life. As each word is presented, 
the subject reacts as quickly as possible by speaking the 
first word that comes into his mind in connection with the 
stimulus word. Such a list of words is given by Jung in 
a series of lectures recently delivered at Clark University. 
This list is as follows: — 
1. head 18. sick 35. mountain 52. to part 
2. green Ig. pride 36. to die 53- hunger

It can be seen by inspecting the above list of words 
that they are extremely simple and that they are so chosen 
Significance 2S to suggest a large number of possible situ- 
* — ations. Naturally, if such a list of words is read, 
thaction or presented visually to a subject, one by one, 
times. and he replies by responding by the first word 
that comes into his mind, the reaction time (that is, the 
time elapsing between the presentation of a word in the 
list and the response) will vary considerably. However, 
under normal conditions there should be a reasonable 
amount of consistency in these reaction times. Most of 
them will probably range between a second and a half 
and three seconds. If any of these reaction times is un- 
usually long, as, for example, six, ten, or fifteen seconds, 
such a lengthened reaction indicates that there is some 
cause at work which results in this extension of interval 
between stimulus and response. It might be supposed 
that the lengthening of these reaction times is due to an 
intellectual reason, but this is not the explanation that is 
ordinarily given. The lengthened reaction is not due to 
‘ the fact that the person lacks the knowledge or intelli- 
Cy gence to reply immediately. The explanation lies rather 
in the emotional condition of the individual who is making 
' the reactions. 
As Jung points out, these excessively long reactions occur often with 
subjects that are highly intelligent and fluent of speech. It is because 
the words presented are “really something like condensed actions, 
situations and things.” To use Jung’s own language, “ When I present 
‘a word to the test person which denotes an action, it is the same as if
-P-A-G-E-219
  - 
“ “The Association Method in A pplied Psychology 195 
I should present to him the action itself, and ask him ‘how do you 
behave toward it?’ ‘What do you think of it?’ ‘What do you doin 
this situation?’ If I were a magician, I should cause the situation 
corresponding to the stimulus word to appear in reality and place the 
test person in its midst. Ishould then study the manner of his reaction. 
The result of my stimulus word would thus undoubtedly approach 
infinitely nearer perfection. . . . The stimulus words are, therefore, 
merely a part of reality acting upon us; indeed, a person who shows 
such disturbances to the stimulus words is in a certain sense really, but 
imperfectly, adapted to reality.” 
There are two reasons generally why lengthened reactions 
occur. The first is because of the various words presented, 
certains_ones have unusual significance, while ay. cause of 
others are, so to speak, indifferent. In the list lengthened 
of words cited above, the word “money ” might T#*#ons-_ 
ordinarily have no unusual significance; if, however, 
the person reacting had committed a theft, such a 
word would arouse in him a strong emotion, and his 
reaction, consequently, would be greatly lengthened, or 
perhaps entirely “ blocked.” (He would fail to reply to the 
word altogether.) The second reason for greatly lengthened 
reaction times is to be found in the general emotional con- 
dition of the person who is being tested. If the person is 
under unusual excitement, or is suffering from hysteria, 
the reactions tend to show great prolongation and irregulari- 
ties. Under these conditions marked disturbances in ad- 
justment to individual words are shown. Sometimes the 
hysterical person, instead of replying with a single word, 
as requested, responds with a large number, —as, for 
example, custom — good — barbaric; foolish —narrow- 
minded —restricted; family — big — small — everything 
possible (cited by Jung). 
Jung explains this tendency as showing one of the main charac- 
teristics of hysterical patients, namely “ the tendency to allow themselves 
to be carried away by everything, to attach themselves enthusiastically 
to everything, and to always promise too much, and hence to do little.” 
Another symptom of incomplete adjustment to the situation suggested 
by the stimulus word is found in the repetition of the stimulus word.
-P-A-G-E-220
  190 The Learning Process 
The person repeats this word as if he were trying to grasp its meaning. 
This is because the subject is confronted with a situation in which he 
finds great difficulty in acting. Sometimes the person tested responds 
to the various stimulus words throughout the test with the same word on 
several occasions, although this word may seem to have no significance 
in connection with the stimulus word. This is to be explained by the 
fact that during the test the subject is being dominated by a particular 
idea, which tends to arise on all occasions and under most varied con- 
ditions. 
Jung and others have made two main applications of the 
association method in practice. Jung himself has employed 
Uees of the this method principally in diagnosing mental 
association diseases which fall under the general type of 
one psychoneuroses, or functional disturbances of 
the mind that appear in various forms of hysteria and 
neurasthenia. The use of the method in the detection of 
crime, however, is one that has proved of the most inter- 
est to the public in general. The method, when employed 
for this purpose, consists in presenting to the subject to be 
tested, among a considerable number of words that are 
neutral or indifferent, a number which refer to the crime 
itself. When these latter words are presented, the person 
tested is naturally more or less disturbed by the situations 
that these words call up, and the result is generally length- 
ened or emotional reaction times. The guilty person 
naturally tends, when he hears the word that is connected 
with his criminal act, to reply with the word that is most 
closely associated. This, however, he does not dare to do, 
as he fears the exposure of the crime. In seeking for another 
and an insignificant word with which to respond to the 
stimulus word, he sometimes becomes greatly confused 
and fails to react at all, or if he does react, the time is far: 
longer than the normal. 
Perhaps the best means of illustrating this method of detecting ac- 
tual or artificially devised crimes is by describing, somewhat in detail, 
one of a considerable number of tests with the association method as 
conducted at the University of Illinois. Two students were instructed
-P-A-G-E-221
The Association Method in Applied Psychology 1097 
  to go to a certain place, where they would find a sealed envelope. One 
of these students was to open the envelope, read its contents, and carry 
out its instructions; the other was to know nothing about the contents 
of the letter, and was to bein no way informed concerning what his 
companion did. The experimenter was subsequently to attempt, by 
applying the association method, to find out which of the two students 
had opened the envelope, read its contents, and carried out its instruc- 
tions. The instructions were as follows: (1) Empty and fill a foun- 
tain pen; (2) Draw a memory picture of the head of your best friend ; 
(3) Burn up the paper; (4) Cut with scissors the largest possible 
square out of an eight anda half by eleven inch sheet of paper; (5) Com- 
pute its area; (6) Shine your shoes; (7) Measure the width of D—— 
Street; (8) Put a dandelion in your buttonhole, and take it out in half 
an hour. In the test, a list of seventy-two words was presented to each 
of the two students. Among these, thirty-two were significant in rela- 
tion to the acts indicated in the letter. Among the significant words 
were the following: Ink, match, strike, flower, yellow, dimensions, 
black, multiply, and flame. In the case of the student who had opened _ 
the envelope and followed out its instructions the reaction times to the 
significant words were considerably greater than were those of the 
student who did not know the contents of the envelope. For example, 
to the word “black,” the “innocent” subject replied with the word 
“green” in one and eight tenths seconds, while the “ guilty ” student 
replied to the same word with the reaction “ flag” in three and eight 
tenths seconds. 
The following introspection by the “guilty” person will indicate 
somewhat the nature of the associations formed with the significant 
words. He says, “Naturally the acts most difficult to perform, or requir- 
ing the greatest time or effort, made the greatest impression. For in- 
stance, such an impossible performance as drawing a memory picture of 
my best friend, or an act requiring a little effort, such as shining my 
shoes, made a great impression. The shining of my shoes stood out 
strongly; first, because I knew that if the questioner cared to, he need 
only look at my shoes and he would know who was who; and second 
but not the least, because I experienced considerable trouble with the 
polish. I bought a box of what I thought to be paste polish, and after 
considerable pounding and scratching, succeeded in prying off the 
cover with the box on edge on the table. The contents itself, instead 
of being in the form of paste, was semi-fluid, and before I could turn the 
box right side up it had spread itself copiously on the table. But it was 
good shoe polish, and gave my shoes a rich black luster. So I remem- 
bered the d/ack shoe polish and the ‘ black’ shoes, and when I heard the 
word ‘black’ they stood out as irrepressible as mountains. In des-
-P-A-G-E-222
  r 
198 The Learning Process 
peration all I could think of was a far-fetched ‘black’ pirate’s flag.” 
(It is to be recalled that the “innocent” subject reacted to the word 
“black” in one and eight tenths seconds, while the “ guilty ” student 
reacted in three and eight tenths seconds). “At the same time I was 
striving to think of some other word than ‘shoes’; I was trying to 
convince myself that it was perfectly proper and logical that ‘ black’ 
should suggest ‘shoes,’ and that I was not giving myself away by 
replying ‘shoes.’ But something insisted, ‘You mustn’t say shoes, 
you mustn’t say shoes,’ and although I knew full well that I might say 
shoes with impunity, I could not. In the same way the word ‘polish’ 
recalled things that I could not turn down, suggested words that I 
might have said as well as not, but I could not. In general, it was easy 
to distinguish between the significant and the non-significant words. 
In all cases it was necessary to make this distinction either consciously 
or unconsciously before any suggestion could even be considered: 
Thus the chief reason for hesitation on the word ‘avenue’ and ‘ deci- 
mal’ was the difficulty in reaching this decision, and hence the reply 
was deferred. In some instances I was quite certain from the nature of 
the act I performed, what the key word would be, and had more or less 
definitely prepared an answer beforehand. In connection with putting 
the dandelion in my buttonhole, and taking it out in half an hour, I was 
quite sure that ‘flower’ and ‘time’ would be two of the key words. 
Also, in connection with emptying and filling the fountain pen, I had 
concluded that ‘ink’ would be one of the key words used, and that I 
must not, by any means, permit it to suggest fountain pen. These prep- 
arations were, however, but of little significance, for though not en- 
tirely forgotten they very rapidly gave way to a flood of other thoughts 
and suggestions.” 
The most important part of wer} work, as far as its 
educational aspects are concerned, is to be found in his 
Children 2M alysis of the psychic life of the child. Signi- 
stronglyin- ficant among the early educative influences of 
at °Y the child’s life are the ideas and emotional ten- 
Sets dencies that arise in connection with the home 
* environment. A pupil of Jung, Miss Fiirst, 
has made a very interesting analysis through the as- 
sociation method of the likeness and differences in the 
types of association of various members of the same 
family group. It was found by her that in their associa- 
tive types children approached nearer the manner of
-P-A-G-E-223
    The Association Method in Applied Psychology 199 
thinking of the mother than of the father. However, the 
son follows more the type of the father than he does of 
the mother, while the daughter resembles more nearly the 
motherin type. The similarity of thinking between mother 
and daughter is often very extraordinary. 
As an illustration Jung gives the following examples : — 
STIMULUS WORD MOTHER DAUGHTER

law command of God Moses

burn great pain painful 
hay dry dry

month many days 31 days 
coal sooty black 
air cool moist 
fruit sweet sweet 
merry happy child child 
Jung remarks, “ Thus the daughter lives constantly in the same circle 
of ideas as her mother, not only in her thought, but in her form of ex- 
pression ; indeed, she even uses the same words. What seems more 
flighty, more inconstant, and more lawless than a fancy, a rapidly pass- 
ing thought ? It is not, however, lawless, and not free, but closely 
determined within the limits of the meu.” Jung analyzes in a very 
interesting way the case of a family, “the father of which is a drunkard 
and a demoralized creature.” The mother is forty-five years of age, and 
there is a daughter of sixteen. The mother and the father have no in- 
terests in common, and the mother seeks her enjoyment from the outside 
of the family, and “for that reason she is an ardent participant in Chris- 
tian Science meetings.” The daughter, imitating her mother in ways 
of thinking, also seeks to obtain emotional satisfaction from without 
the home. “But for a girl of sixteen, such an emotional state is, to say 
the least, quite dangerous. Like her mother, she reacts to her environ- 
ment as a sufferer soliciting sympathy. Such an emotional state is ne 
\ :
-P-A-G-E-224

longer dangerous in the mother, but for obvious reasons it is quite dan- 
gerous inthe daughter. Once freed from her father and mother, she 
will be like her mother; that is, she will be a suffering woman, craving 
for inner gratification.” 4 
Jung urges that such considerations as this point to the 
great importance of the environment in education. What 
passes from the mother to the child “is not the The great . ae ‘ 
importance 00d and pious precepts, nor is it any other incul- 
ao cation of pedagogic truths... . The concealed 
discord between the parents, the secret worry, 
the repressed hidden wishes, all these produce in the in- 
dividual a certain affective state . . . which works its way 
into the child’s mind, producing therein the same condi- 
tions and hence the same reaction to external stimuli. .. . 
The father and mother impress deeply into the child’s 
mind the seal of their personality ; the more sensitive and 
mouldable the child, the deeper is the impression. Thus 
even things that are never spoken about are reflected in 
the child. ... Justasthe parents adapt themselves to the 
world, so does the child.” Jung believes that these prepu- 
bescent experiences of the child often determine his destiny 
in his entire adult life. ‘Every patient furnishes contri- 
butions to this subject of the determination of destiny 
through the influence of family mz/zeus. In every neurotic 
we see how the constellation of the infantile wz/zeu influ- 
ences not only the character of the neuroses, but also life’s 
‘destiny, in its every detail. Numberless unhappy choices 
of profession and matrimonial failures can be traced to 
this constellation. There are, however, cases where the 
profession has been happily chosen, where the husband or 
wife leaves nothing to be desired, and where still the person 
does not feel well, but works and lives under constant dif- 
ficulties. Such cases often appear in the guise of chronic

neurasthenia. Here the difficulty is due to the fact that 
the mind is unconsciously split into two parts of divergent 
tendencies which are impeding each other; one part lives 
with the husband or with the profession, while the other 
lives unconsciously in the past with the father or mother. 
: We can find here one of the most important tasks 
of pedagogy, namely —the solution of the problem, how 
to free the growing individual from his unconscious attach- 
ments to the influences of the infantile mz/zeu, in sucha 
manner that he may retain whatever there is in it that is 
suitable and reject whatever is unsuitable.” 
In the importance which Jung places on the earlier 
associations of childhood, he is in agreement,with an 
other worker in the field of abnormal psychol- Freud's), 
ogy, namely, Sigmund Freud)of the University ‘psycho-” 
of Vienna. The great service Freud has ren- *#S!8:) 
dered to applied psychology is in the so-called field o 
psycho-analysis. The method of psycho-analysis was first 
worked out with hysterical patients, and briefly consists in 
attempting, by a series of questions, to draw out of the 
subconscious life of the patient an account of those expe- 
riences that are the fundamental cause of the mental dis- 
turbance. To use Freud’s own statement, “our hysterical 
patients suffer from reminiscences.” The reminiscences 
are not, however, a clear and definite knowledge of the 
past experiences ; they are rather symbols of these past 
experiences. The method of psycho-analysis attempts to 
discover behind these symbols the concrete experiences 
for which they stand. In this way the patient is led by 
expressing himself to free himself from the force of the 
subconscious associations which have been making havoc 
in his mental life; and thus a cure is often brought about. 
The interesting part of Freud’s theory lies in the fact 
that these hysterical conditions are in a large measure to 
be traced back to the suppressed wishes of early childhood, 
many of which make their appearance before the fourth

year. Because of the incompatibility of these wishes with 
the general social environment, they are repressed and for 
otten, and yet they are never entirely lost Significance S ; y y y ; of sup- since they determine to a very large measure 
ca the reactions of adult life, and are connected 
with this life by a long series of associated 
bonds. The apparent, almost complete, discontinuity be- 
tween the pre-adolescent experiences and those of later 
life is due to the fact that the earlier experiences are 
repressed and blotted out of memory. Freud holds that 
because we are ignorant of the most important features of 
the mental life of childhood, and because of our personal 
forgetfulness of this period in our own life, the signifi- 
cance of these earlier associations is vastly underesti- 
mated. Accordingly not only do these repressed and 
forgotten experiences of childhood work themselves out 
disastrously in the life of the hysterical patient, but they 
also determine, to a considerable extent, the associative 
trends of adult experience. Freud believes that the vast 
majority of these suppressed wishes of early childhood are 
directly or indirectly sexual in their nature. He applies 
his theory to the interpretation of dream states, to art, and 
to wit. Dream states he considers as symbols of suppressed 
wishes. By applying the method of psycho-analysis, the 
individual can often discover what these suppressed wishes 
actually are. Art, like the dream state, may be thought 
of, according to Freud’s theory, as a symbolic expression 
of suppressed wishes. Here we find a psychological value 
for myths, legends, and fairy tales, as expressions of pe- 
rennial desires and as a means for giving an outlet to such 
desires in safer channels, than those along which they might 
naturally go. Wit, according to Freud, has much in it that 
resembles the mechanism of the dream. It allows the ex- 
pression of a thought indirectly which could not, because of a 
certain repressive tendency be expressed in its natural way.! 
1 An admirable summary of Freud’s position is given by Jones in the Jour- 
1 of Nervous and Mental Diseases (May, 1910).

From this point of view it appears that czvi/ization has 
imposed an ever increasing necessity on the child Cistticdiaz 
and on the adult to suppress their most funda- makes the ° ° realization mental wishes. Such a repression, however of nasi 
desirable or necessary, is tremendously dan- wishes im- 
gerous. Renunciation is not always a virtue. P**?!* 
Thus we find reality generally thoroughly unsatisfactory, and we 
“keep up a life of fancy in which we love to compensate for what is 
lacking in the sphere of reality by the production of wish-fulfillments. 
In these phantasies is often contained very much of the particular con- 
stitutional essence of personality and of its tendency, repressed in real 
life. The energetic and successful man is he who succeeds by dint of 
labor in transforming his wish fancies into realities. Where this is not 
successful in consequence of the resistance of the outer world and the weak- 
ness of the individual, there begins the turning away from reality. The 
individual takes refuge in his satisfying world of fancy. . . . _If the 
individual who is displeased with reality is in the possession of artistic 
talent, which is still a psychological riddle, he can transform his fancies 
into artistic creation. So he escapes the fate of a neurosis, and wins © 
back his connection with reality by this roundabout way.” Unless some 
such indirect way of expression is found, then the subject is confronted 
with a neurosis which “takes in our time the place of the cloister, in 
which were accustomed to take refuge all those whom life had undeceived 
or who felt themselves too weak for life.” 1 
One of the most, general conclusions that may be 
deduced from the work of Freud and Jung is that as- 
sociative bonds between various thought com- fhe im- 
plexes are much more imperative in their nature Perative ; ; character of 
than we ordinarily suppose them to be. They associative

the individual may wish to dissociate an idea from the 
complex to which it naturally belongs, he finds himself 
often incapable of doing this, particularly under strong 
emotional excitement. Freud maintains that there is a 
“ strict determination of mental life, which holds without ex- 
ception.” So fixed is this determination and so extensive

its scope that the threads of association lead back to the 
very beginnings of experience. There is nothing that comes 
into the mind, but what has some connection with all the 
vest. If then, it is true that such extensive and permanent 
associations are formed, it becomes of the greatest moment 
how they are formed and what direction they take. The 
educative process becomes under such a point of view even 
more significant than it is ordinarily supposed to be. 
The insistence of both Jung and Freud on the great 
importance of infantile experience changes the emphasis 
i tiace from adolescence to the pre-adolescent period. 
of infantile The educational philosophy of Hall and his 
experience. pupils has made adolescence the great and de- 
termining period in child life. For this reason it may 
have seemed to many educators and teachers that, after all, 
nothing final could be accomplished before this period, and 
that, therefore, the great intellectual and moral problems in 
the life of the child were not those that confronted the 
teacher in the primary and in the grammar grades. Jf the 
views of Jung and Freud, however, are correct, then, the crises 
of life are perhaps to be found in its earliest years, and the 
great educative problems of the race are to be solved in the 
nursery and the kindergarten, rather than in the high school, 
college and university. The fact thatthe large majority of 
children never go beyond the grammar grades in their 
formal education is interesting and significant in this con- 
nection. If the formative period of life is largely in the 
pre-adolescent period, then the possibilities of determining 
character through the school environment are greatly en- 
hanced. 
The view of Jung in regard to the tremendous influence 
of the home environment emphasizes the value of education 
in improving heredity. The almost overwhelm- 
ing importance of heredity in predetermining the 
whole life of the individual has been emphasized 
by a number of statistical investigations in the last few years. Importance 
of the home.

Woods! and some others seem to believe that but a rela- 
tively small amount can be accomplished by environmental 
influences. Perhaps it is well to err in the opposite direction 
in overemphasis of the factor of environment, since it is the 
only factor over which education has any direct control. 
While in these early influences the home must always have a 
much greater place than the school, nevertheless, the school 
may be no insignificant factor in developing the right sort 
of association complexes. The teacher should see to it par- 
ticularly that all emotional and vexatious disturbances are 
removed from the atmosphere of the schoolroom, that the 
ideas inspired in the minds of the children are of the satis- 
Jying type. This will do vastly more in moral education 
than the insistence on any number of maxims, or the learn- 
ing of many facts in regard to desirable or undesirable con- 
duct. From this point of view the rush and hurry that 
characterizes much of the school work becomes extremely 
dangerous. “ Busy work” that makes excessive demands 
on both pupil and teacher, and creates an atmosphere of 
unrest, must be avoided. The irritable teacher ts a positive 
menace to the mental sanity of the pupils under his charge. 
If, as Freud believes, a large part of the suppressed 
wishes of childhood arise in connection with direct or 
indirect sexual tendencies, the problem of deal- ie : : : e problem 
ing with matters of sex is one of the greatest of sex edu- 
importance. For a long time thoughtful edu- “4% 
cators have felt that we cannot do away with this problem 
by foolishly ignoring its existence and by attempting, in 
every way, to deceive the child in regard to the nature of 
sex and the origin of life. It is, however, a tremendously 
difficult problem to decide just what can be done in the way 
of properly educating the child in these matters. Jung 
1 See “ Mental and Moral Heredity in Royalty ” (New York, 1906). The 
author comes to the conclusion that “heredity is almost the entire cause of 
the mental achievements of these men and women, and that environment or 
free will must consequently play very minor réles.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
The Learning Process — 
  discusses in one of his lectures at Clark University the 
case of a little girl of four years of age, of intellectual 
vivacity and of a healthy, lively, and emotional tempéra- 
ment, who developed a remarkably strong interest in regard 
to the problem of sexual reproduction, and whose curiosity 
was finally legitimately satisfied by a frank explanation of 
the whole matter.? 
Jung in summing up this discussion says, “I wish to impress 
firmly upon parents and educators this instructive example of child 
psychology. In the learned psychological discussions on the child's 
psyche, we hear nothing about those parts which are so important for 
_ the health and naturalness of our children, nor do we hear more about 
the child’s emotions and their conflicts ; and yet they play a most 
important role. 
“It very often happens that children are erroneously treated as im- 
prudent and irrational beings. . . . The ideashould be dismissed once 
for all that children are held in bondage by, or that they are toys of, 
their parents. They are characteristic and new beings. In the matter 
of enlightenment on things sexual it can be affirmed that they suffer from 
the preconceived opinion that truth is harmful. Many neurologists are 
of the opinion that even in grownups enlightenment on their own 
psychosexual processes is harmful and even immoral. . . . One should 
not, however, go from this extreme of prudishness to the opposite one, 
— namely of enlightenment @ fout Prix, which may turn out as foolish 
as it is disagreeable. In this respect I believe the use of some discre- 
tion to be decidedly the wiser plan ; still, if children come upon an 
idea, they should be deceived no more than adults.” Doubtless, in the 
biological and physiological instruction in the schools, much could be 
done to answer the legitimate inquiries of children in regard to this 
whole problem. 
Freud has shown in his psycho-analysis the therapeutic 
value of bringing into full consciousness and expression the 
Suet obscure memories of the past. This form of 
acquaint- confession may also have significance for chil- 
ance wwe dren. If parents and teachers could enter into 
thoughts more intimate associations with children and 
and desires. ould obtain their confidences, it would not 
only reveal much that is happening that would be well for

  The Assocpation Method in Applied Psychology 207 
adults to realize, but it would also serve as a means of 
expressing, in an indirect way, some of those childish 
wishes, which through suppression may result in highly 
undesirable consequences. The pedagogical value of con- 
fession has not been fully realized in the Protestant world. 
In an earlier part of our discussion we have considered the 
desirability of the teacher knowing the contents of chil- 
dren’s minds in regard to their percepts, concepts, and 
general intellectual apperceptions. The content of chil- 
dren’s minds in this more intimate sense is something 
which has hardly been realized as a problem until recently. 
The psycho-analyses of Freud and others will probably 
give us a more exact psychology in these respects than we 
have at present. As yet we have barely raised the prob- 
lem; its ultimate solution is still remote, but in the mean- 
time, parents and teachers should strive to put themselves 
into such relations with children, that their most intimate 
thoughts should not be entirely unknown. Here lies one of 
the greatest problems of moral education. | 
Psycho-analysis has shown the possibility of sublimating 
wishes impossible of direct realization by giving them sym- 
bolic forms of expression. This roundabout wie art, 
way of expression seems to be extremely impor- 4nd moral 
tant. A wish that is completely repressed, that seinen 
finds no avenue of realization, and sinks into the ts. 
subconscious life, may become an extremely dangerous ele- 
ment therein. If, however, it can find some legitimate 
method of expression, it has lost its dangerous character. . 
It is for this reason that Freud holds that dreams are ex- 
tremely valuable to the individual, since in them he ex- 
presses in a symbolic way his hidden desires. More 
definite and certain forms of expression through symbols 
are to be found in artistic creations and in religious and 
moral ideals. Also various forms of wit and humor seem 
to serve the same sort of a purpose. In passing, the fact 
should be emphasized that education cannot ignore these
-P-A-G-E-232
  208 | The Learning Process 
as elements in the life of the child and still be of the high. 
est service to the individual and the race. The school and 
the home should be the place for the encouragement of 
true artistic ability. It should give in the proper place re- 
ligious and moral inspiration, and should emphasize the 
value of wit and humor as a mode of interpretation of the 
world of the child. The instruction in these very neces- 
sary forms of human expression cannot be merely of the 
formal and dogmatic sort. Much depends upon the tact 
and sympathy of the parent and teacher in their dealings 
with children. 
Of recent years considerable attention has been given to the subject 
of children’s drawings. It has been discovered that the child’s first 
crude attempts are merely schematic or symbolic. These drawings are 
not representations of animals, men, e¢ cetera, in the sense that they at- 
tempt to reproduce objects actually as they appear in nature. These 
drawings are ideographs. Later the child attempts to make objects that 
are more true to life, and gradually the technique of drawing becomes a 
conscious factor. However, the technical aspect of the matter is not the 
only thing to be considered. The creative aspect must also be kept in 
mind. Some children show marked genius in making their drawings 
express ideas or emotions. These children should be encouraged. The 
teacher of drawing should not confine his efforts to the teaching of tech- 
nique alone. He should attempt to develop creative genius wherever he 
finds it. 
In closing, a word may be said about the more direct 
applications of Jung’s method of association and Freud’s 
Pavelai- psycho-analysis in dealing with children in the 
analysisin homeandintheschool. The association method, the home . 
assis as has already been pointed out, seems to be val- 
eed uable for two chief reasons; one is, that by its 
application, various crimes, misdemeanors, and secrets in 
the lives of individuals may be brought to light. The 
application of this method in the discipline of the school at 
once suggests itself. It probably could accomplish some- 
thing in the way of discovering facts that the teacher 
should know. If, however, it is practiced at all, it should
-P-A-G-E-233
\ The Association Method in Applied Psychology 209 : 
be only with a large amount of caution, and only by skilled 
and intelligent persons. Psycho-analysis in the form of 
intimate and sympathetic discussions with children would 
be of considerable value, especially in the home. It can 
be carried out, however, only when the parent or teacher 
has the entire confidence and love of the child. 
It is for all these reasons that chzldren demand, in their 
earliest years, the most intelligent and considerate treatment. 
The time may come if parents cannot give such 
treatment, when the state will be forced to place cee 
little children in an environment more suited to ree 
their healthful development. The schools should 
recognize more than they do the importance of the elementary 
teacher. Some educators are of the opinion that the in- 
struction in the lower grades is very much less important 
than it is in the grammar grades and in the high school. 
They have come to this conclusion largely because, as has 
already been said, the memories of early childhood are no 
longer definitely retained in adult life, and because the 
adult has little ingenuity for penetrating into the innermost 
experiences of children. It appears to the adult, then, that 
these earlier experiences, since they are not definitely in 
consciousness, are of slight value. Lf-the cenclusions of 
Jung and Freud are correct, no greater mistake could 
possibly be made. It has been insisted in an earlier part 
of the discussion that education must interpret memory 
very much more broadly than mere recollection of the past. 
Anything that enters into the life of the child so as to 
modify his conscious experiences later, must be considered, 
from a practical standpoint, as memory. How much these 
earlier unconscious memories may modify adult experience 
has already been pointed out. It is possibly not too much 
to say, in the light of the work of the psycho-analyst, that 
the very best teachers, the ones best paid and the ones 
occupying the highest social positions, should be the 
iteachers of little children rather than of mature students, 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
       
210 The Learning Process 
for the forces of heredity and of infantile environment are 
such that less than is often assumed is left for the adult 
years to accomplish. Of course the education of the 
mature student cannot be ignored, and no one would main- 
tain that our scheme of education in the high schools, 
colleges, and universities should be less efficient than it is 
at present. Educational reform in this direction. consists 
in additions to the efficiency of teaching in the earlier 
yeats, but not at the expense of a decreased efficiency at a 
later period. 
Jones, in a recent number of the Journal of Educational Psychology * 
has summed up in an interesting manner some of the more important 
applications of psycho-analysis to education. He says, among other 
things: “Success is best achieved by gradually weaning the child to 
social interests, and not by merely forcibly suppressing and forbidding 
the primitive ones without replacing them by others.” In discussing 
the desirability of enlightening children on sexual matters at an early 
age he says: “The customary endeavor to keep the chiid’s mind a 
blank on the subject is far from being a negative one, as parents com- 
monly maintain: the organized conspiracy of silence is soon noticed by 
the child. . . . Those who object to direct enlightenment, therefore, 
‘should recognize that they are really defending a false enlightenment, a 
positive teaching of shame and guilt.”

of one mental function on allied mental functions. 
It thus relates itself to the question of the value of training 
in form as distinguished from training in content, and leads 
naturally to a discussion of the so-called “ Dogma of 
Formal Discipline.” } 
In the early years of the nineteenth century Gall and his 
pupil Spurzheim gave to the world the “ Anatomie et physio- 
logie du syst¢me nerveux,” in which is to be found he faculty 
adetailed exposition of Gall’s System of Phre- Psychology, ‘ ; . . and cortical 
nology. According to this system, the brain is {ocaliza- 
supposed tocontain more than thirty separate and 40. 
individual organs which are the seat of the most complex 
psychic capacities, or “ internal senses,” such as combative- 
ness, the fear-of-God, a sense-of-fact, the impulse-of-self-pre- 
servation, philoprogenitiveness, and the sense-of-language. 
It was only an incident to this system that the locality | 
of these internal senses was found on the surface of the 
brain, and that the external evidence for them existed in 
certain prominences on the skull. The interest in this now 
bizarre theory lies, as far as this discussion is concerned,

in the fact that here we find in a most pronounced form 
two basal assumptions, one of which has served as a conven- 
ient vehicle for the justification of the dogma of formal dis- 
cipline, while the other lies, in part at least, at the basis of 
the theories of those who in their reaction against this 
dogma have gone in the other direction to extremes which 
seem equally absurd and incapable of justification. ( The 
first of these assumptions is that the mind is composed of 
a number of separate faculties, and’ from this it readily fol- 
lowed that these can be educated in their entirety and made 
to serve in the various situations of life equally well for all 
purposes. The second assumption has looked upon the 
various activities of the nervous system, particularly of the 
cortex, as highly specialized and definitely localized, and 
has viewed the corresponding psychic functions as some- 
thing quite discrete and separate. Carried to its logical 
extreme it would seem to imply that, for example, there is 
not only a cortical center for language, but a distinct area for 
nouns, or for verbs, or what not; not only a cortical center 
for vision, but a definite area for color; then why not for all 
the thirty-two thousand color qualities which the eye can 
sense? There seems to be no.limitto the multiplication of 
centers which can result from such a theory, and it surely 
serves as a firm foundation for the doctrine that there is no 
education in general, and that the best we can do is to train 
the individual to interpret a certain number of definite sense 
stimuli and to respond to a limited number of concrete situ- 
ations in the same old way. The faculty psychology as- 
sumed a number of fabulous entities which worked out the 
destinies of the individual, while the doctrine of absolute 
localization of nervous function has made the brain a mach- 
ine of relatively unrelated parts and has created a doctrine 
of psychic atomism which is as untrue as it is impossible of 
practical application. 
The faculty psychology of the last century is long since 
dead, and its resting place almost has been forgotten by

among the masses, and its spirit still lives in the pedagogical 
theories of many an uncritical thinker. From he facutty 
this faculty psychology it is no far cry to the Psychology pee ‘ ‘ . assumed 
dogma of formal discipline in, all its purity. mental 
The assumptions it contains are well expressed Powers: 
by a clergyman quoted by James in the first volume of his 
larger Psychology: ‘‘As for my memory,” writes the 
clergyman, “it has improved year by year... like a 
gymnast’s muscle.” This is a favorite comparison, the 
likening of memory, or attention, or any other supposed 
psychic faculty to a muscle that can be developed for 
any use by any kind of exercise, and that is made equally 
strong by rowing, or boxing, or chopping wood, pro- 
vided that the exercise is vigorous enough; and, having 
been made strong by one exercise, can be used equally 
well for all activities. No less a scientist than Helmholtz 
is quoted by Coover and Angell’ as valuing particularly 
certain studies as a means of intellectual training, since 
these studies taxed ‘equally all the intellectual powers.” 
Here we have the doctrine of formal discipline and its 
pedagogical consequence expressed definitely and clearly. 
The implication of Helmholtz’s assumption seems to be / 
that there are definite mental powers and that these powers 
can be deyeloped in all directions by certain well-chosen 
studies. 
Bagley in his “ Educative Process”? puts the matter con- 
cretely in this way: “ Certain subjects of the curriculum, if 
properly pursued, were believed to develop __ 
what might be termed ‘generalized’ habits. ats J

in connection with language and drawing; that, function- 
ing successfully here, it cannot fail to insure neatness of 
person and attire, and that the habit of neatness thus in- 
grained upon the pupil will surely be carried into mature 
years.” Thus it is assumed that there is a general faculty or 
habit of neatness, and that this, when trained by one set of 
exercise, will be serviceable in all the specific situations in 
life where neatness may be employed. Stated thus, the 
dogma of formal discipline is absolutely untenable. There 
isno general faculty of neatness, nor of any mental capac- 
ity, and if there were such an entity, training it to function 
in one direction would not mean that it is trained equally 
well to function in all directions.

necessarily mean ability to reason equally well 
in the affairs of everyday life; it seems certain that if I 
wish to increase my ability to discriminate between shades

as far as distinguishing shades of gray is concerned, it is 
quite indifferent whether the person has had previous

as to make the latter assertion; but many would believe 
that such a transfer of training is in most instances slight, 
and in some cases such a transfer is not probable, even in 
the slightest degree. Some seem to assume that about all 
‘that education can hope to do is to give to the pupil certain 
facts in a limited department of knowledge, and to habitu-. 
ate him to definite reactions in a circumscribed field of 
human activity. They seem to despair of any education 
in general that amounts to much. Having, however, 
admitted the possibility of transfer from one field to an- 
other, never mind how little, they are incapable of deter- 
mining @ priort how great this transfer may be and what 
general effects it may have. Such persons may try to 
bring some definiteness into their conceptions as to the 
extent of this transfer by saying that such a transfer can 
take place only where there is a similar situation, and 
where like elements are involved; but it must be remem- 
bered that similarity and likeness are not primarily objec- 
tive categories, but that they are constituted by the mind 
of the person who finds such similarity or likeness, and 
that it is never certain beforehand just where this similar- 
ity and likeness are to be found. Such acontention can be 
determined only by actual tests either in life itself, or in 
the psychological experiment. Fortunately we have had 
in the last few years a considerable number of such experi- 
ments reported, and the light which they throw on the 
whole question of formal discipline is more illuminating 
than that which can be secured from a discussion of a priori .¢ 
assumptions, or “half-baked” psychological theories. We,~ FR 
therefore, turn to them for the purpose of reviewing they 4)

The two pieces of experimental evidence which have 
probably had the most influence in discrediting the doctrine 
of formal discipline and in emphasizing the opposite doc- 
trine are those of James of two decades ago, and the more 
recent series inspired by Thorndike of Columbia Univer-

by no means proved the impossibility of transfer, though —

James. | The conclusions of James, on the other hand, are 
more radical than those of Thorndike. James, in his 
chapter on “ Memory” in the larger “Psychology,” ! says: 
All improvement of memory consists, then, in the improve- 
[ment of one’s habitual methods of recording facts. By this 
he means to deny that there is any improvement in memory 
power as such, the improvement being solely due to the 
method or the technique of memorizing. He then gives in 
a footnote a description of certain tests carried on by him- 
self in support of his assertion. Since these tests are the 
first of a considerable number of later experiments con- 
ducted in a similar way, a brief description of their general 
nature will be given here. Like those that have been un- 
dertaken later by other investigators, the essential technique 
of these earliest experiments consisted in giving the subject 
of the test certain material to learn, thereby determining 
his capacity for learning as measured by a definite standard. 
The material for this first learning constitutes what is 
termed the “test series’’; it is followed by a period of prac- 
tice in learning some other kind of material, and this second 
material is known as the “practice series”; this practice 
series is then followed by another learning of the material 
of the test series, and the improvement or lack of improve- 
ment over the first trials gives a measure of the effect of 
the practice series on the ability to learn. 
To take a concrete case, James tested himself by learning on eight 
successive days 150 lines of Victor Hugo’s “Satyr.” He says : “ The 
total number of minutes required for this was 1313—Jit should be 
said that I had learned nothing by heart for many years. I then, work- 
ing for twenty-odd minutes daily, learned the entire first book of “ Para-

  The Transfer of Training 217 
dise Lost,” occupying 38 consecutive days in the process.” He then 
went back to the learning of Victor Hugo, and found that, while before 
the training he had learned at the rate of one line in 50 seconds, after 
the training he learned at the slower rate of one line in 57 seconds. 
James added that during the second learning series he was perceptibly 
fagged with other work, which, of course, invalidated the entire experi- 
ment. 
Other persons under James’s direction carried on similar experiments 
under somewhat better conditions, and the results showed a slight 
positive effect of the training. 
These experiments are to-day chiefly of historical a 
They were not carried on under the strictest experimenta 
conditions and are valuable mainly as pioneer investiga- 
tions in the field. They are important also because their 
conclusions were given to the world with the tremendous 
authority that the zpse dixzt of their author has always 
carried. Thus they have done much to reform the entire 
notion of the possibilities of memory training and of train- 
ing in general. 
The second set of experiments which have been men- 
tioned above as having had an important pedagogical 
consequence are those of Thorndike and Wood- fhe experi- 
worth! reported under the title, “The Influence ments of 7 : Thorndike 
of Improvement in One Mental Function upon and Wood- 
the Efficiency of Other Function$.” Tests were worth 
_conducted to determine the influence of the training in 
the estimation of magnitudes on the ability to estimate 
magnitudes of the same general sort; the influence of 
training in estimating weights on the ability to estimate 
the weight of miscellaneous objects of similar weight; and 
the influence of the practice in marking words containing 
certain letters on the marking of words containing other 
letters, misspelled words, e¢ cetera. In these varied tests 
most of the subjects showed some improvement when 
tested after the practice series. Thorndike’s general con- 
clusion is that, while there is some improvement, it is not

due to any “ mysterious transfer of practice, to an unana- 
lyzable property of mental functions,”’ but rather to a func- 
tioning of identical elements in the practice series and in 
the final test series. This improvement, on the whole, 
does not seem to be great, and its spread is limited largely 
to activities that closely resemble one another. Thorndike- 
maintains that in “transfer” identical elements are always 
involved. This identity is of two sorts, identity of sub- 
stance and identity of procedure. Identity of substance 
constitutes the objective elements in the transfer, identity 
of procedure the subjective aspects. The latter covers a 
wide range, and includes general methods of technique in 
learning, attitudes, and dispositions. The subjective ele- 
ments are, in part at least, constituted by the learner, and 
vary not altogether in terms of the subject matter that is 
being mastered; they are largely dependent on individual 
purposes and interests. 
Another experimental study which seems to point in part to the 
same general conclusions as those> f Thorndike and Woodworth was 
conducted also at Columbia University by Bair.1 This experimenter 
made an extensive investigation and analysis of the practice curve. 
The writer, however, concludes that “any bit of special training also 
helps us to receive training in general. Any training helps us to find 
ourselves. It gives us a method of orientation which leaves us in our 
reactions not entirely at the mercy of chance, even in unfamiliar situa- 
tions. The experience which we get from special training gives us a 
general power to meet an entirely new situation with a more favorable 
response than had we not had this special training.” 
The recent experiments of Foster on the effect of prac- 
tice on visualizing 2 leads the investigator to the conclusion 
Foster’sex- that practice is specific. “Practice with one 
periments. set of conditions is valuable in a new Set, only 
in proportion as the second set of conditions contain iden- 
tical ability-conditioning factors."" He gps no evidence

  from his experiments to show that training has made his 
subjects (three in number) “noticeably better observers or 
memorizers in general, or given them any habits of observ- 
ing closely or reporting correctly, or furnished any ability 
to meet better any situations generally met with.... It 
appears, moreover, that little ability is gained by continuing 
practice beyond a certain relatively short time. Specific 
practice is demanded for best results and becomes quickly 
effective.” The author concludes by calling attention to 
the fact that since his experiments were made on adults 
already trained in habits of attentive observation, the con- 
clusion arrived at may not apply to immature or untrained 
persons. For the latter, practice in visual reproduction 
may possess a general value not discovered under the con- 
ditions of his particular investigation. 
A series of experiments on transfer was conducted a 
few years ago by Coover and Angell! on the general 
practice effects of special exercises. In one ; aos ; > ; The experi- 
experiment the training series consisted in the jents of 
discrimination of sound intensities, the test Coover and 
series in discriminating shades of gray. A oe 
clear transfer of the practice effects was shown, as was 
also the case in a lesser degree in a second test, in which 
the training series consisted in sorting cards and the test 
series in typewriter reactions. The authors conclude from 
the objective results and the introspections of the subjects 
that the improvement consists in “divesting the essential 
process of the unessential factors. There is a greater 
habituation and more economical adaptation of attention.” 
Likewise Bennet? reports the results of an experiment 
with sixteen children to determine the effects of discrim- 
inating between shades of blue on the subsequent ability to 
discriminate between shades of other colors and of black. 
His results seem to clearly indicate a transfer effect.

nog - _ The Learning Process 
  Fracker! recently carried on a series of experiments on 
the transference of training in the psychological labora- 
Fracker’s tory of the State University of Iowa. The same 
sent general methods in the use of training and prac- 
: tice series were employed as in the previous 
experiments cited. 
The training series consisted in memorizing the order of 
four tones. The test series were eight in number as fol- 
lows: (1) memory for poetry ; (2) memory for the order of 
four shades of gray; (3) memory for the order of nine 
tones ; (4) memory for the order of nine shades of gray ; 
(5) memory for the order of four tones; (6) memory for 
the order of nine geometrical figures; (7) memory for the 
order of nine numbers; (8) memory for the extent of arm 
movement. Clear indication of transfer was found, gen- 
erally more marked in those cases where the test series 
and the practice series were similar, although it sometimes 
happened, as in Thorndike’s experiments, that improve- 
ment was not noted in some cases where there was great 
similarity between the practice and test series ; indeed, the 
practice seemed to have a negative effect. The results of 
the experiment did not, however, support Thorndike’s con- 
tention that ‘‘improvement in any single mental function 
rarely brings about equal improvement in any other func- 
tion, no matter how similar.” In many cases Fracker 
found that improvement was absolutely greater in amount 
in the test than in the training series. During the experi- 
ment the introspections of the observers were carefully 
recorded, and they indicate that mental imagery and prop- 
erly controlled attention have much to do with the transfer. 
Bagley discusses in the “‘ Educative Process”? results with 
children tested in the Montana State Normal College. 
The writer attempted “to determine whether the habit of 
producing neat papers in arithmetic will function with ref- 
1 Psychol. Rev., Monograph Supplement, 1X, No. 2, pp. 56-102 (1907). 
2 Chapter XIII, p. 208,

erence to neat written work in other studies.” He states 
that “the results are almost startling in their failure to 
show the slightest improvement in language paptey's 
and spelling papers, although the improvement oe 
in the arithmetic papers was noticeable from the through 
first.” Bagley suggests that the failure to secure ideals. 
transfer in the particular experiment reported by him was 
due to the fact that the habit of neatness had not been 
made a conscious ideal in the minds of the children. 
Ruediger! attempted to verify experimentally Bagley’s 
theory. He carried on tests for eight weeks in three dif- 
ferent schools, all with pupils in the seventh Tin aoe 
grade. He found that when the emphasis on of Ruediger

talks to pupils on neatness, so that the habit was raised to 
clear consciousness, decided improvement was shown in 
subjects no more closely related than geography, arith- 
metic, grammar, and history. In other words, the habit 
was constructed into an ideal, and a transfer was thus 
made which seemed entirely lacking when the whole pro- 
cedure was on the level of the subconscious. More re- 
cently Ruger? has come to a somewhat similar conclusion 
in his experiments with complicated puzzles. He says, 
“In general, the value of specific habits under a change 
of conditions depended directly on the presence of a gen- 
eral idea which would serve for their control.” Subjects 
who developed a general formula in the solution of one form 
of a puzzle experiment were able to utilize the special habit 
built up in the solution of this form when they attempted 
to solve the puzzle in a second form. Those who did not 
develop this general ideal of procedure were not capable 
of transferring the specific habits from one form of the 
puzzle to another.”

The person tested was required to judge the length of certain 
lines, and he was seated in such a position that his right hand 
and arm were entirely hidden from view by a large screen. Whatever 
he did with his right hand was, therefore, unseen by him. “On the 
left side of the screen, and in full view, nine different lines were shown 
in succession, and he was required to place a pencil held in the unseen 
right hand in the direction indicated by the several lines seen before 
him.” After this the reactor was given “fuller visual experience ’’ with 
one line, and an improvement at once took place in regard to this line. 
This improvement was found to be transferred by later tests to the other 
lines, but in some instances this transfer was negative, z.e. there was 
an actual interference. The lines that in the original series had shown 
an error similar to that of the line with which fuller visual experience 
had been obtained, showed a positive improvement in the test series ; 
those in which the error had been in an opposite direction grew worse. 
In both cases, however, there were clear evidences of a transfer effect, 
but in the second case the transfer was negative. 
In a second series of tests, geometrical figures werecompared. Be- 
cause of an illusion, one of these was overestimated, another underesti- 
mated. During the experiment one observer was kept in ignorance of 
the results, while the other was fully informed. Then the figures were 
reversed and a second series of tests were begun. In this the observer 
who knew the effect of practice adjusted himself to the new conditions. 
The other observer, who did not know the effects, showed a greater 
error than at any time, and was unable to improve, because, as Judd 
believes, the habit had now become so firmly fixed that training could 
no longer modify the reaction. 
A similar test was later carried on with school children, who were 
required to hit a target placed under water. This was difficult, because 
of the deflection of the light through refraction. In the test one group 
was instructed in the nature of refraction, while the others were kept 
in ignorance. The boys in this test who had been instructed did no 
better than the others, but in a second test, in which the depth of the 
target in the water was reduced from twelve inches to four, the boys 
who had the theory fitted themselves quickly to the new conditions, 
while with the other group the errors were large and persistent. These

    The Transfer of Training 
experiments clearly show the value of a knowledge of conditions heFG 
connection with the transfer of training. 
The significance of raising the activities to be transferred 
above the plane of mere habit to the realm of conscious 
purpose is again illustrated by a series of tests pyperi- 
carried on by the Department of Psychology at oon 2 
the University of Illinois, in which about two versity of 
hundred children of the practice school of the Hiinois. 
Eastern Lilinois Normal School, at Charleston, Illinois, and. 
later nearly fifteen hundred in the grades at Bloomington, 
Illinois, were first trained in inscribing the letter X on 
sheets of paper ruled in squares for the particular experi- 
ment. Later, half the group were practiced in inscribing 
various geometrical figures in these squares; and at the end 
of the practice the entire group were tested a second time 
in inscribing the letter X. The results show in these ex- 
periments a positive transfer in accuracy, but a negative 
result in regard to speed. The explanation of this result 
is to be found in the fact that during the practice series 
the nature of the work done by the pupils\emphasized the 
factor of exactness, and hence raised it to the level of clear 
consciousness in the minds of the pupils. This resulted 
in giving the practiced group in the second test a clear 
advantage over the non-practiced group, as far as accuracy 
was concerned. 
Thorndike and Woodworth are in general agreement with the point 
of view that emphasizes the value of raising the activity to be transferred 
to clear consciousness. In their experiments they found the “acquisi- 
tion of definite ideas an important part of the influence of improvement 
in one function on the efficiency of others.” 
The experiments described above have secured results 
that have been interpreted either by assuming a transfer 
of identical elements, in which case there can hardly be 
said to be an actual transfer, but rather the functioning of 
old elements in new complexes; or by assuming that inci- 
dental phases in the learning are transferred from one set

of activities to another, these incidental aspects being 
classed in general under the term of a better Conclusions . : . of Ebert technique of learning. They include, among 
ik Sogn other things, facile adaptation of attention, 
the control of mental imagery, the ignoring 
of distractions, and the divesting of the learning process 
of unessential elements. Another theory of transfer holds 
to a rather mysterious “spreading” of effects from one 
field of physical or psychic activity to another. Ebert and 
Meumann consider transfer to be primarily of this nature. 
These investigators conducted a series of tests of an 
extended nature to determine the effect of a special train- 
ing in memory on the ability to memorize in general.! 
At the beginning of the Meumann tests, the memories of the subjects 
were determined for nonsense syllables, numbers, letters, one-syllabled 
substantives, Italian words, poetic words, prose words, and visual signs. 
In the training series which followed, the subjects were given nonsense 
syllables to memorize, and then the original test series was repeated to 
determine improvement, if any, both for immediate recall and for per- 
manent retention. Later the experiment was carried still farther, a 
second training series followed by another test series being introduced. 
The special training with nonsense syllables evidently increased the 
ability of the subjects to memorize and retain the materials of the test 
series. The amount of the transfer was found to be great. The 
ability to memorize philosophic prose, for example, showed an increase 
of seventy per cent after the practice series, and to memorize visual 
signs, fifty-five per cent. 
The investigators consider that increased power of at- 
tending, increase in voluntary effort, improvement in the 
technique of learning, and general decrease in discomfort 
and tediousness are the chief auxiliary causes for the im- 
provement after practice. They believe, however, that 
beyond these conditions, and fundamental to the process 
of transfer, lies a sympathetic interaction of allied memory 
functions, based on an assumed psychophysical activity. 
The existence of such an uncertain relationship is denied

_ by the reviewers of this piece of work. Miiller,1 who has 
criticized these experiments, believes that the transfer can 
be best explained by considering the so-called auxiliary 
aids as the sole cause of the results obtained. 
The most serious defect in the investigations of Ebert 
and Meumann consists in the fact that they did not providea 
parallel control experiment in testing theirobserv- a 
ers. All the six persons tested were given both of a parallel 
the test and the practice series. In a properly ea 
controlled experiment, on the other hand, a part in transfer 
of the subjects tested are not given the practice *** 
between the first and the second tests. Various experi- 
ments have shown that unless this precaution is taken no 
valid conclusions can be arrived at as to the amount of 
transfer, since both the practiced and the non-practiced 
groups show improvement in the second over the first test. 
It is only by a comparison of the relative amount of im- 
provement in the two groups that the influence of the 
intermediate practice can be ascertained. 
The necessity of the parallel control experiment was strikingly shown 
in the case of the Charleston investigations described above. Both the 
practiced and the non-practiced groups showed marked improvement 
in the second over the first test series ; yet by comparison of the relative 
improvement of the two groups it was found that there had been slight 
positive transfer in the case of accuracy, and a negative transfer, or an 
inhibiting effect, in the case of rapidity. 
One of the first experimenters to guard against this error 
was Winch,? who performed a series of experiments on 
three different groups of English school children Bered. 
some years ago. Winch divided the children ments of 
into two groups of equal ability as to memory, “"°™ 
as determined by a preliminary test in learning a passage 
from a historical or geographical reader, and also by the 
judgment of the teachers. Subsequently one group was 
practiced in the learning of poetry, while the second group

worked sums. In the various tests, improvement was 
shown for both the group practiced in memorizing poetry 
and the group engaged in sums. However, in the former 
group the improvement made was more marked. 
Various experiments in “cross education” throw some 
light on the possibility of transfer. The principal researches 
Experi- in this field were conducted in the Yale psycho- 
ments bear- logical laboratory under the direction of Scrip- 
ew on ture. The first series of experiments considered 
the problem the increase of muscular steadiness through 
oe practice in inserting a needle in a very small 
hole, and the transfer of this increase to the corresponding 
muscles of the opposite half of the body. The left hand 
was tested first, and showed fifty per cent of correct trials, 
but after practice with the right hand for ten days the left 
hand showed seventy-six per cent of successes. Scripture 
explains these results as due primarily to a training of the 
attention rather than to any carrying over of skill in adjust- 
ment. Experiments on the increase of muscular power 
after practice showed “a steady increase in the muscular 
power of the right hand due to practice, and also an increase 
in the power of the left hand, due to what might be called 
‘indirect practice.’ ”’ 
Further experiments conducted by Davis under Scripture’s direction 
on the rapidity of tapping a telegraph key showed improvement through 
practice not only for the part of the body practiced, but for other mem- 
bers as well. Experiments in strength of voluntary effort in lifting 
dumbbells showed a transference of the effects of practice from the right 
to the left arm in muscular development and endurance. Experiments 
in lunging at a target with a fencer’s foil showed that practice with the 
right hand affected the left hand positively. According to Davis, the 
results of the experiments showed not only that effects of exercise may 
be transferred, but also that “ will power and attention are educated by

physical training, and that when developed by any special act they are 
developed for all other acts.” 
Among minor investigations and observations bearing more or less 
directly on the problem may be mentioned Volkmann’s ? tests of a half 
century ago on the influence of practice on spatial discrimination. He 
investigated the fineness of space discrimination on the skin by means 
of the Weber compass, and found that practice with the finger tips of the 
left hand increased the fineness of discrimination of the finger tips of 
the right hand, but not of the left forearm. Practice with the third 
phalanx increased the fineness of discrimination on the first phalanx. 
Also of interest are the investigations of Urbantschisch, of Epstein, and 
of Vogt, cited by Coover and Angell.2 Urbantschisch found that a 
sound stimulus increased the sensitivity of the subject for visual, gusta- 
tory, olfactory, and tactile stimuli. Similar results are reported by 
Epstein in regard to the relation between auditory and visual stimuli. 
Vogt showed that habituation to distractions in one situation could be 
carried over to other fields. 
Wallin reports in the March number of the Journal of Educational 
Psychology for 1910 that practice with one eye in illusions of reversible 
perspective is clearly transferred to the unpracticed eye ; likewise 
practice effects are transferred from the fovea to the peripheral retina. 
Lee, in discussing the nature of fatigue,? states that work of one tissue 
may cause the fatigue of other tissues. 
A number of investigations to ascertain the correlation 
existing between the grades of pupils in various subjects of 
the curriculum have been conducted and have gtudies in 
been taken as indicating the existence of such correlation . ‘ : based on 
reciprocal relations between the studies as_ pupil's 
would indicate the possibility of transfer effects. 84des- 
One of the most careful and striking of these was under- 
taken some years ago by Rietz and Shade.*’ This concerned 
itself with inquiring into “the facts of correlation between 
the efficiency of students in mathematics and their efficiency 
in (1) foreign languages, (2) natural science.” The method 
of investigation may be characterized in a general way as

that of Galton and Pearson. The source of the data is the 
records of the registrar of the University of Illinois. The 
results of the investigation are, in brief, that ‘‘a high cor- 
relation exists between efficiency in mathematics and 
foreign languages.” While the results here do not in any 
way indicate whether there has been a transfer of training 
in mathematics to the other subjects, they seem to,show that 
studies as far apart as mathematics and foreign language 
evidently have many points in common, so that training in 
one subject might very well be made effective in the other. 
Other experiments in correlation between various studies 
have been carried on with various results, none of them, 
however, furnishing any conclusive evidence in favor of or 
against the possibility of transfer, since it cannot be argued 
because there is a high correlation between various courses 
that for this reason these courses are causally related, so that 
training in one will result in greater efficiency in the other. 
This fact is plainly shown by the investigations of Winch on “ Accu- 
racy in School Children.” ! The investigation concerns the possibility of 
the transfer of accuracy in the working of simple sums to ability in solv- 
ing arithmetical problems. Winch assumes that if there is a highly 
positive correlation between the two forms of accuracy, it is to be con- 
cluded “ that one function causes the other, or that there is a common 
factor in the two functions, or that both functions are the result of some 
prior quality or power which develops approximately equally in both 
these directions, or, finally, that the high correlation isa mere together- 
ness without relations or interdependence.” The result of the experiment 
showed that while a high positive correlation (in one case + .85) did 
exist in the various groups of children studied between accuracy in work- 
ing rule sums and accuracy in arithmetical reasoning, there was practi- 
cally no evidence of transfer effects from training in working sums to 
accuracy in reasoning. Thewriter concludes: “It seems to be possible 
to find highly correlated functions which appear to have very little 
relationship of pedagogical value. We cannot conclude without further 
inquiry on other lines that two highly correlated mental powers are 
causally related. . . . Two qualities may be highly correlated, but the 
ratios of their growth may not be; nor may we beable to produce increase 
in the one by producing increase in the other.”

  CHAPTER XV 
THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 
DuRING recent years a large number of theoretical treat- 
ments have appeared in regard to the possibility of formal 
discipline. Amongthe earlier discussionsofthe _—s_ 
problem, those of Brown and Hinsdale are the tient 
most important. Brown,! while criticizing the a Hins- 
general doctrine, urged that a considerable num- 
ber of mental attitudes and affective dispositions, such as 
voluntary attention, methodical habits, self-confidence, and 
love of truth, are capable of transfer from one field of 
learning to another. Hinsdale? more vigorously attacked 
the views of the extreme “ formalists,” and asserted that 
“the power generated by any mental activity is far more 
special than general. No one kind of mental exercise can 
develop the mind asa whole.” Gradually, because of these 
earlier theoretical discussions, and also because of the ex- 
perimental results obtained by James, Thorndike, and others, 
there arose more and more a tendency to discredit z# foto 
the doctrine of formal discipline, some writers like Bolton 
and O’Shea taking extreme positions in opposition to the 
belief in transfer of mental functions. More recently the 
expression of opinion has been less extreme, and most writ- 
ers have admitted the probability of a considerable amount 
of transfer under certain conditions. 
One of the most important of these mediating views is 
found in a symposium on formal discipline by J. R. Angell 
of the University of Chicago, W. B. Pillsbury of the Uni- 
1“ How is Formal Culture Possible?” The Public School Fournal, 
December, 1893.

versity of Michigan, and C. H. Judd of the University of 
ae Chicago. This symposium was given at a 
of Angell Meeting of the Michigan Schoolmasters’ Club 
favorable to jn Ann Arbor, April 2, 1908, and _ subse- transfer. ; j ’ : 
quently published in the Educational Review for 
June, 1908. 
Angell summarized his discussion as follows: (1) “Certain 
habits gained in the mastery of one study may be appro- 
priated directly in another; they may (2) be slightly modi- 
fied before such application, and still show for their 
possessor a great gain as compared with the individual 
who has to start from the beginning. (3) These habits 
may be incorporated in larger habit groups, either with or 
without slight modification. (4) They may tend to impede 
certain antagonistic habits, and in turn be impeded by 
_other previously extant and inhibitory habits. (5) But 
in all these cases, the instances of inhibition as well as 
those of reinforcement and incorporation, it seems prob- 
able that a certain gain in the power to use and sustain 
attention will accrue from any purposeful and persistent 
intellectual application. .. . (6) What subjects best rein- 
force one another; what ones most inevitably conflict with 
one another; whether these relations are dependent upon 
the mode of presentation, rather than upon the subject- 
matter itself,—these and other similar questions, too 
numerous to. point out, must one and all be answered by 
experiment and experience. Dogmatism is wholly im- 
possible in advance of such drastic and exhaustive investi- 
gation.” 
Pillsbury says: ‘‘ You can not be sure that any fact is 
absolutely unrelated to any other, and so far as they are 
Pillsbury’s related, learning the one makes easier learn- 
viewsare ing the other.. .. Training one part thus 
similar. trains related parts, and the whole in some de- 
gree. ... So the man with well-rounded training is 
probably on the average better trained for learning in any
-P-A-G-E-255
  Theoretical Aspects of the Problem 231 
field than the untrained man, or even than the man with a 
narrow education in any other field.” 
Judd concludes his paper as follows: ‘ Does nature- 
study train in observation? Does washing of slates train 
in neatness? Does saying good-morning to the principal 
conduce to good manners on the playground? 
If there is any dogmatic answer given you when j¥d¢ holds 
you ask these questions, put it aside. There is mind is not 
no single answer to any one of these questions. eee 
.. . We may make our pupils eager seekers compart- 
after truth, or we may make them bigoted little ™°"* 
dogmatists. What we do will depend very much upon 
what we and our interests are. If we believe in specialized 
functions, we shall probably do very little to generalize 
knowledge in our students. If, on the other hand, we have 
broad views of the subject we are teaching and of our task 
in teaching it, we shall find very little in practical experi- 
ence to bind us to the narrow view that mental life is 
made up of water-tight compartments.” 
A second symposium on formal discipline by E. B. 
Delabarre, E. N. Henderson, and H. H. Horne, was pre- 
sented before the Brown University Teachers’ Dincuaaine 
Association at Providence, April 3, 1909,and pub- before the 
lished in Education for May of the same year. sti 
Delabarre in his article distinguishes between the Teachers’ 
content and the formal aspects of conciousness. “SS°i#tion- 
He maintains that “no individual can, by his own unaided efforts, 
acquire any large number of essentially reliable forms.” No one 
can enumerate all the important formal elements. “ It must be a 
part of the task of educational theory to learn what they are; dis- 
tinguish between those that are desirable and true and those that are 
unreliable.” The writer concludes that “these formal elements can be 
taught; that one subject unquestionably helps in the learning of others ; 
that there are disciplinary subjects that are of especial value for this pur- 
pose; that not only does good training in any subject improve methods 
of learning, of attention, of work, of comprehension; but it is also true 
that all knowledge possesses some elements in common, and the number
-P-A-G-E-256
    
232 The Learning Process 
of these may be very considerable, even in the case of subjects that 
appear at first sight little related.” 
Henderson in his discussion reviews the experimental 
work on the transfer of training, and concludes that it is 
difficult to determine whether discipline in form or disci- 
pline in content is more valuable. Training in each is pos- 
sible.} 
Horne in his discussion maintains that “ present study 
helps us in the later situation in so far as common features 
are involved. ... There are no subjects which give an 
‘all round mental training,’ for no such training is pos- 
sible.” 
Meikeljohn, in a paper read before the New England 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools at Boston 
Meikeljohn University, October 9, 1908, and published in 
argues from the Lducational Review for February, 1909, ap- 
eas, proaches the problem of formal discipline from 
the standpoint of the logician. He defines 
formal training as ‘discipline in certain discoverable 
forms of intellectual activity. It does not imply the bad 
psychology of the faculties; it does imply the thoroughly 
sound and respectable distinction of form and content 
which is made by the logician.” The writer concludes 
that “it is one of the tasks of education to so train the 
mind that it may do well the work of thinking. In order 
to accomplish this, it must select those kinds of mental 
activity which seem most fundamental and important for 
the life of the student.” 
1 In his recent book entitled, “Text Book on the Principles of Education ” 
(New York, 1910), Hendersonsums up an extensive review of the literature on 
formal discipline with the following statement: “There is something which 
may appropriately be called formal discipline. It consists in the establish- 
ment of habitual reactions that correspond to the form of situations; these 
reactions foster adjustments, attitudes, and ideas that favor the successful 
dealing with the emergencies that arouse them, On the other hand, both 
the form that we can learn to deal with more effectively, and the reactions 
that we associate with it, are definite. There is no general training of the 
powers or faculties, as far as we can determine.”

233 Theoretical Aspects of the Problem 
W. C. Ruediger, in a recent volume on the “ Principles of 
Education,” devotes considerable space to the discussion of 
formal discipline. While not taking a positive ege . . <s Ruediger position either for or against transfer of training, }etieves 
he maintains that the evidence deduced concern- that train- 
oe, “ : ing pos- ing such transfer “does not argue for an inde- sgegses a 
pendence and discreteness of mental functions, —— 
but for an interdependence and interrelation of 
such functions. This being true, we should expect not 
only that one function will assist another somewhat related 
function, but that under different conditions the first 
would interfere with the second.... The channels 
through which improvement is carried from one mental 
function to another may apparently all be grouped to- 
gether under the head of ‘identical elements.’ ... As 
a means of transfer this is easily comprehensible and re- 
moves all mystery from the process. It, however, is fre- 
quently difficult to tell when two processes are mentally 
identical, and when they are not. An apparent resem- 
blance or divergence may prove misleading when subjected 
to test... . If we have analyzed the doctrine of formal 
discipline correctly, it is evident that its extreme advocates 
and its extreme opponents are both wrong. Knowledge 
and training are not merely specific in their application, 
but they also have a general value.” 
The various writers above citedin general find no little 
value in a modified statement of the doctrine of formal dis- 
cipline. W.H. Heck, on the other hand, in a Heck sees recently published monograph on “ Mental Dis- 
cipline and Educational Values,” takes an op- 
posite position, although not denying the clearly 
established fact of transfer of training. Heck danger in 
an emphasis 
of the doc- 
trine of

discipline. 
believes that the doctrine of formal discipline is 
at present doing much harm in educational theory and 
practice, and he gives as the main purpose of his essay the 
effort to modify the doctrine, and “upon a modification to
-P-A-G-E-258
  234 The Learning Process 
establish a standard of educational values.” The doctrine 
“continues to make itself felt throughout our school sys- 
tem and... the opposition to it is disorganized, timid, 
and bookish,” asserts the writer, in his introductory chapter ; 
but later on he says that there is a “ popular demand for 
more practical courses in schools.... The doctrine 
of formal discipline is retiring from the elementary 
schools, and is showing signs of increasing discomfort in 
the secondary schools.” Further, “the adherents of the 
doctrine of formal discipline shrink from carrying their 
doctrine to its logical conclusions,” while “the business 
and professional world relies more and more on the supe- 
riority of specialized ability, resulting from specialized 
training. Men are thereby becoming more efficient 
specialized workers, but less adaptable, less transferable, 
more dependent upon the specialized demand for their 
work.” The “timid opposition” to the dogma of formal 
discipline does not seem to be so ineffectual as the writer 
at first would lead us to believe. Indeed, from his own 
statement of conditions, it seems legitimate to inquire 
whether in the theoretical and practical reaction against 
the dogma of formal discipline we have not already gone 
too far in the opposite direction. Are we not at present 
confronted rather by the danger of giving up our ideas 
of a general education, and becoming adherents of the 
dogma of spectfic training ? 
Heck, in his arguments against the doctrine of formal 
discipline, does not attempt, in the light of the experimental 
setae evidence which he reviews, to deny the possi- 
arguments Dility of transfer. He rather tries to show that 
a ok this result is not brought about through the 
transfer of skill in a specific activity or ability, 
but by the development of general concepts of methods 
which may be applied to various situations, and by the em- 
ployment of common elements in various specific activities. | 
Thus the writer is in substantial agreement with the con-
-P-A-G-E-259
Theoretical Aspects of the Problem =—235 
clusions reached by the several investigators cited above; 
yet the general impression he conveys is that the whole pres-’ 
ent attitude in regard to the possibility of formal training 
is wrong and dangerous. It should, however, be remem- 
bered that, while many who still hold to a belief in transfer 
of training do so from the standpoint of an exploded 
psychological theory, and that while it is extremely impor- 
tant to determine the exact nature of the transfer process 
from the standpoint of psychological theory, this deter- 
mination is of relatively less significance from the standpoint 
of educational practice. The essential fact remains for 
the educator to consider that tvazning in one activity does 
help the performance of other activities. For this reason 
it would be a great misfortune to convey the belief gener- 
ally that because the doctrine of formal discipline may be 
wrong in certain of its theoretical aspects, the practical 
effect of learning in one field upon learning in another is 
nil. Such a belief would do more harm to educational 
theory and practice than any number of academic psycho- 
logical heresies (even that of the old “ faculty psychology ’’) 
could possibly effect. 
Heck’s chief arguments against formal discipline are 
based, not on experimental evidence, but on certain theo- 
retical assumptions. In the first place, he yp. 
overstates the doctrine of formal discipline as identifies 
it would be held to-day by any one whose opin- ee 
ion is of value or influence. He says, “The discipline ; eee ca ° ; with the old 
doctrine of formal discipline implies that the facutty 
mind is made up or possessed of certain general Psychology. 
powers or faculties. ... Development in_ strength, 
breadth, accuracy, etc., of the power involved can be used 
in response to any other stimulus than the one by which 
the power was previously exercised, with little change in 
nature or diminution in amount.” In the first place, no 
one will attempt to say in any undetermined case whether 
the exchange by transfer shall be slight or large, and
-P-A-G-E-260
  236 The Learning Process 
further, as a matter of fact, the much abhorred “ faculty 
psychology” of our fathers is not basal to a belief in the 
transfer of mental training. Naturally, when the doctrine 
was first formulated, it was stated in terms of the psy- 
chology then current. It could have been stated in terms 
of up-to-date functional psychology almost as well. This 
seems to be the common mistake that the opponents of 
transfer generally make, namely, the assumption that be- 
cause the doctrine of formal discipline first appeared in the 
setting of the faculty psychology, it must of necessity be 
invalidated with the passing of that psychology. With 
equal justification from logic, one might argue that because 
the belief in heaven was originally coupled with the old 
Ptolemaic conception of the universe, this belief was de- 
stroyed when the Copernican system superseded the older 
cosmological ideas. 
A second theoretical objection which Heck finds to the 
doctrine of formal discipline is that it is not compatible 
He obi with the current theories of localization of e objects 
toiton the nervous function. Heck hold that “for every 
eat particular state of consciousness there is a con- 
ofnervous comitant stimulation of particular groups of 
ae cells in the cerebral cortex.” In other words, 
he seems to adopt a theory of absolute localization, al- 
though he recognizes the fact that “cortical activity is not 
limited to these particular groups of cells in relation to 
a particular state of consciousness, for consciousness at 
any moment is related to an equilibrium of activity in the 
cortex as a whole.”’ 
Heck appears to be here on the horns of a dliterniiia: 
If he denies the possibility of formal discipline on the 
This places ground of a narrowly interpreted theory of 
Heckina nervous localization, he is basing his conten- 
dilemma. ‘tion on a hypothesis that not only has behind 
it no verifiable facts, but also is in conflict with what is 
known concerning the nature of conscious processes. If,
-P-A-G-E-261
  Theoretical Aspects of the Problem 237 
on the other hand, we accept a view of relative localization 
which more nearly accords with the known neurological 
facts, and with the activities of consciousness, there is 
nothing in this latter view which precludes the possibility 
of a very general transfer of practice effects. In short, if 
we try to overthrow the doctrine of transfer on the ground 
of absolute localization of nervous functions, we are doing 
so on dubious theoretical grounds, and holding to a theory 
which runs counter to what we know of mental elements 
and mental organization. If, on the other hand, we 
accept the doctrine of relative rather than absolute local- 
ization, of colligation of remote functional areas, and of 
vicarious functioning (as does Wundt), we find that such 
an hypothesis, instead of making against the possibility 
of transfer, gives a clear basis and reason for such trans- 
fer. Indeed, a rational hypothesis of cerebral localization 
suggests codperation and transfer of the widest possible 
sort. 5 
In the third place, Heck bases his opposition to the 
doctrine of formal discipline on the assertion, so commonly 
made, that habits are specific and that a gen- 
eralized habit is impossible. The possibility of eal 
the existence of a generalized habit has been habits are a A = ; specific. 
discussed in a preceding chapter?! of this book. 
Here it was maintained that it was admissible to term 
certain habits general, first, when the specific stimulus 
calls forth a specific reaction common to a large variety of 
situations; second, when a reaction is under the domi- 
nance of a mood or emotion that so colors the objective 
environment that several different stimuli may call forth 
the habitual response; third, when in any definite reaction 
to a given situation not merely one elementary adjustment, 
but many, are involved. This particular principle was 
illustrated by the activity of writing, in which are included, 
beside the specific stimuli and reactions involved in the 
1 Chapter III, pp. 49-51. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
    The Learning Process” 
| | 
writing as such, other stimuli and reactions in terms of 
the total schoolroom situation. 
Perhaps this thought may be made more clear by the 
accompanying diagram. In this the script letters a, 4, 
I .. ¥Y, &, represent certain specific activities in which n forming 
specific the pupil is being trained. «@, however, involves 
he other the more general adjustment W, which in turn 
habits may involves the still more general adjustment S. 
beset up. Now while in the activity 2, W and S are both 
involved, these may also be involved equally well in still 
other activities. For example, W is involved among 
other things in the 
activity 4, while S 
is involved not only 
in W, but in R as 
well. To be more 
concrete, let us sup- 
pose that @ repre- 
sents the a-copying 
habit, and W the 
writing habit and S 
the school habit, 
while R_ represents 
the reading habit 
@ and y the habit of 
reading in verse, 
Now it is quite obvious that in learning to copy 4, the 
other higher habits, if they have not already been formed, 
will of necessity gradually be set up. Suppose the child 
should begin his activities in school (which, of course, he 
actually would not) by learning to copy the letter a. In 
this activity he would gradually acquire the more funda- 
mental habit of paying attention in the schoolroom and of 
the general technique of learning to write. Thus in learn- 
ing to copy the a, he would have also acquired a stock of 
habits which could be transferred to other school situa- 238 / 
        none = -—- — 2 we ow ee oe
-P-A-G-E-263
Theoretical Aspects of the Problem 239 ~ 
tions. In other words, learning to copy a would constitute 
a general training as well as a specific habit-forming 
activity. 
' So we are justified in speaking of general habits of at- 
tending, or of thinking, or of willing, although, as Bagley 
would urge with justice, attention, thought, and 
resolution are mental states, which, as highly con- Perera! 
scious, raise the individual above the plane of thinking 
habitual activities, and make it possible for him a Ase oo) 
to respond in a new way to a new situation. The fact, 
however, that he does attend, has the attitude of attention, 
is due to certain specific tendencies in reaction which have 
been gradually acquired and made reflex. The attending 
to the dictation of the teacher, for example, brings into the 
consciousness of the child a situation to which he may 
intelligently react, but the possibility of getting the attitude 
of this attention is largely dependent on many subcon- 
scious and habitual factors, such as ignoring unessential 
stimuli, disregarding tedium, and in general having de- 
veloped a technique of learning. These elements have 
been emphasized by most of the investigators above cited 
as essential in the process of transfer. 
If we consider again the diagram just discussed, we shall be able to 
see how it explains some of the facts of transfer or its lack, as shown in 
investigations above considered. In one of the tests of Thorndike, for 
example, the subjects were given practice in marking the words ona 
printed page containing the two letters ¢and s. Before and after this 
training these subjects were tested in marking the words containing 
other combinations of letters, misspelled words, different parts of 
speech, etc. Improvement in the second test series was measured by 
increased speed and accuracy. In general speed was more likely to be 
improved than accuracy. The reason for this is perfectly obvious in 
terms of our diagram, as can be seen from the following: Suppose that 
@ represents the practice in marking the words containing ¢ and s, while 
6 represents the marking of words containing the other letters, etc. It. 
is quite obvious that the specific marking habit acquired in the first 
series enters into conflict in a certain sense with the marking of words 
containing # and /, for example, since the attention is turned from
-P-A-G-E-264
  240 The Learning Process 
words of one general make-up in the practice series to those of another 
composition, in the test series. Thus the acquired tendency to mark 
words containing ¢ and s will actually tend to inhibit the marking of 
' words containing # and /. Hence there may be a falling off in ac- 
curacy. On the other hand, the more general reaction of marking 
words has been trained at the same time as the habit of marking specific 
words. This latter phase of the habit (which Thorndike would term an 
identical element, but which may better be called a more general atti- 
tude) may be transferred from the marking of one kind of word to the 
other. This might result in greater speed, and at the same time dimin- 
ished accuracy. If a subject had been trained to high efficiency in the 
word-marking habit, further training in marking certain specific words 
would tend to exercise a negative influence in marking other words 
similar to them. The nearer the activities were alike in this case, the 
greater would be the distraction of attention, and the greater the fall- 
ing off in efficiency.

CHAPTER XVI 
PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS IN REGARD TO THE 
TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
As a result of the various investigations and discussions 
concerning the possibility of the influence of certain men- 
tal functions on others, a number of definite 
facts are established. In the first place, it is The tactof 
quite evident that there is no one study that is ot be. 
of such a nature, either as to content or method 
of instruction, that it can train the mind equally well in 
all directions; neither can it be assumed that drill in this 
can be carried over without loss to other studies or prac- 
tical activities, never mind how similar in nature. Equally 
absurd and unwarranted, on the other hand, is the attempt 
to deny all reciprocal influence between various mental 
activities, or to hold that such influence is so slight that it 
is not worth while to seriously consider it in planning and 
arranging courses of study. That there are transfer 
effects, often of a considerable amount, cannot be doubted 
by any one who seriously and impartially examines the 
evidence. The fact of transfer cannot be doubted. The 
factors involved in such transfer, the extent to which trans- 
Jer can take place under any given set of conditions, and the 
best methods of securing such transfer will long doubtless 
remain questions for investigation and discussion. 
The question whether the results are due to functioning 
of identical elements (Thorndike); to improvement of habit- 
ual methods of recording facts (James); to train- pgcumé of 
ing the attention and will power (Scripture and _ the various 
Davis); to divesting the essential process of eA of 
the unessential factors, greater habituation and ‘nsfer. 
more economical adaptation of attention (Coover and 
R 24! 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
    4 ’ 7 
242 | The Learning Process 
Angell); to the effective use of mental imagery and prop 
erly controlled attention (Fracker); to the development of 
ideals (Bagley, Ruediger, and Ruger); to general improve- 
ment in technique of learning, attention and will-power, but 
chiefly to a sympathetic interaction of allied memory func- 
tions (Ebert and Meumann), or to all of these, or to some 
other factors as yet not analyzed out, will doubtless for a 
long time offer a fruitful field of inquiry. 
The possibility of a general training is thus seemingly 
established both in theory and in fact, and it becomes the 
Rules for DUSiness of education to consider how such a 
securing training can best be secured. It seems possible 
in the light of all the evidence presented on the 
subject of transfer to lay down with tolerable certainty a 
few rules of procedure. 
I. The first rule should be: Make those specific activi- 
ties which you wish to transfer the object of thought. Let 
| the significance of! the habit and its general 
orgie bearings become known to -+the person who is 
formed to the subject of the training. Bagley has empha- 
eM gese’ sized this factor in training, in his doctrine of 
transference through ideals, and the experiments 
of Ruediger and Ruger seem to justify the contention. 
The results of Judd, who, as previously stated, has shown 
that practice with knowledge has. a value in the transfer of 
training which practice without knowledge does not pos- 
sess, also point to the same general conclusion. Likewise, 
Meumann has found that it is desirable in training children 
formally to bring to their attention the significance of such 
training. It further should be said that our knowledge of 
the functioning of the nervous system is in strict accord 
with this general position in regard to transfer, since the 
association fibers of the cortex are the ones which connect 
various sensory and motor areas, and their function is prob- 
ably primarily related to the higher conscious processes. 
It would seem, then, that we have a definite means which
-P-A-G-E-267
Conclusions in Regard to the Transfer of Training 243 
education can pursue in formal training, and this means re- 
moves the criticism that such training is merely mechanical 
and deadening. 
2. Train the child in the techniqye—of learning and in 
the processes that make learning effective and economical. 
Nearly all the investigations emphasize the 
value of properly adapted attention, of satisfac- Train 
tory physical and mental attitudes in securing pepe 
transfer. Sustained attention should be devel- © 
oped in the school training, not merely for the sake of the 
object attended to (perhaps not primarily for the object’s 
sake), but rather for the sake of attention itself. The 
whole art of learning should be carefully and skillfully 
controlled. The importance of right methods of learning 
has been emphasized in recent years, largely through the 
work of Meumann. It appears that one of the chief aims 
of education should be to teach. the child how to acquire 
knowledge with the least expenditure of_time and energy 
compatible with its retention for effective use. One of* 
the greatest needs of formal training in this connection 
is the development of the. child’s.mentalimagery. See to 
it that children can employ various kinds of imagery 
effectively, develop the imagery for form and for color, the 
imagery for sounds and for kinzesthetic sensations of throat, 
hand, and fingers when possible. Many a poor reader 
cannot visualize, many a child deficient in nicety of motor 
control lacks kinzesthetic imagery; all training in musical 
notation is worthless knowledge unless the child has fair 
auditory imagery. 
3. In seeking to secure transfer, especially where pur- 
pose does not play an important part, see to it that the 
stimulus which is to call forth the desired reaction is such 
that it may be a common element in many objective situa- 
tions. If, for example, it is desired to promote in general 
the habit of observation, it will be unwise to cultivate this : 
habit in a very narrow and unusual field of experience.
-P-A-G-E-268
  244 The Learning Proces : 
Habits of observation may doubtless be secured by train 
ing the observer to give careful attention to objects appear- 
ing understhe microscope. This training in ob- See that the ‘ . | 
De asishe servation will on the whole probably have less 
may bea possibilities of transfer to other fields than will common 
element training in observation cultivated in the study 
inmany § of more common objects of life, such as plants situations. 
and animals that are often met with in the daily 
environment. 
In this connection it should be kept in mind that habits of a very 
simple nature are much less likely to transfer to activities other than 
those in which they originate than are habits of a more complex char- 
acter. These latter can function, in part at least, in a large variety of 
situations. The practice effect of marking out @’s on a page containing 
various letters not only may not facilitate the marking out of 3’s, c’s, 
etc., but it may actually hinder the rapidity with which these latter 
letters are marked out because of the previous training in attention in 
marking out @’s.1_ Likewise it should be remembered that a complex 
habit may act in various ways when transferred to other activities than 
those under which it first was set up. Some of the elements in such a 
complex habit may work positively under the novel conditions, and other 
elements negatively. In the habit of marking out letters referred to 
above, at least two elements seem to be present, the one consisting in 
making the proper eye movements over the page, the other in attending 
to the letter to be marked out. It is quite easy to understand how it 
might happen that in transferring the habit from marking out a@’s to 
some other letter, one of three results might be obtained, depending upon 
the previous training of the subject of the test. Positive transfer effects 
would appear if the training in eye movement were more important for 
the subject than attending to the particular letter to be marked out. A 
neutral result would be reached when the two factors of eye movement 
and attention balanced each other, and a negative, or inhibiting, result 
would occur when the factors of attention were more important than the 
eye movements. It is because most habits are far from simple that even 
when there is a neutral result in the transfer experiment, it cannot there- 
fore be concluded absolutely that there is no reciprocal relation between 
the two sets of functions tested. 
1 Such a result actually was reached in the experiments at the Charleston 
Normal School, previously referred to.

Conclusions in Regard to the Transfer of Training 245 
4. Education should cultivate through specific training 
general emotional attitudes. Moods and feelings often are 
the dominant elements in a situation, and these j : Cultivate can readily be transferred. The child who ha: proper atti- 
the proper emotional attitude toward his school ae sas 
life will be the one who will act most capably i 
the school environment. Education should see to it that 
such general feeling attitudes as docility, respect for au- 
thority, eagerness to be of service, and the like are devel- 
oped through the school training. Such attitudes, unlike  . 
the ideals which Bagley emphasizes, need not (perhaps 
should not) be raised to full consciousness. This has a 
bearing on the moral instruction of the schools. It may 
be that intellectualizing what ought to be an emotional 
attitude is a dangerous procedure. It is a well known fact 
that the examination of an emotion tends to destroy it. 
This thought has significance in relation to temperance in- 
struction and the like. The question may well be raised, 
has not the instruction on the effect of alcohol and nar- 
cotics the tendency to make the child’s attitude merely a 
matter of intellect, when it should primarily remain one of 
feeling and of will? 3

any great degree. Ifthe pupil has already de- 
veloped his maximal power of learning by rote various 
kinds of material, further practice in one kind of material 
of necessity cannot have any effect in improving rote 
memory with other materials, however similar they may be. 
On the other hand, if this rote memory has not reached its 
highest perfection in the pupil, training with one sort of 
material may transfer its effects to other materials, which 
are memorized ina similar manner. It would seem prob.

able for this reason that highly trained laboratory subjects 
would show less general effect of training than would 
naive subjects, and that adults would show less effect than 
would children. The laboratory subject who has mas. 
tered the technique of giving himself over to the test at 
hand, who knows how to hold his attention down to the 
minimum of fluctuation and to overcome the loss of interest 
arising through ezuwz,can expect to get little general train- 
ing in carrying on such a specific activity as judging areas, 
tapping at dots on paper, or learning nonsense syllables. 
The greatest possibilities of transferring general attitudes 
of attention, thinking, etc., except as conscious ideals or 
purposes, lie, then, with untrained adults and with children, 
especially with the latter. This makes the educative pro- 
cess hopeful where children are concerned, and relatively 
hopeless with adults. Itis not that adults cannot learn 
new habits, as James maintains in his famous chapter on 
“Habit”; it is that they cannot generalize these habits that 
makes the man of forty an old fogy. 
Finally, if it is true that a formal training is possible, 
and if it is desirable that the schools furnish such a train- 
pi ing, we come back to the old question as to 
subjects whether there are certain studies that are better 
Notes suited than others to offer this discipline. It 
line than do can be safely asserted that there are subjects 
orks which, either because of the nature of their sub- 
ject matter, or because of the better technique that goes 
with their instruction, are to-day more valuable than others 
from the standpoint of mental training. Other studies 
which are not now so well developed will, perhaps, some 
day take the place of mathematics, or natural science, or 
the classics and modern language, but to-day they are less 
valuable from a disciplinary standpoint. 
It is not without interest to note at the present time, when so many 
are raising the question as to the fundamental value of the older dis- 
ciplines, the reactionary attitude taken by Shorey in his defense of the
-P-A-G-E-271

classics) among other things he says: “Information, knowledge, 
culture, originality, eloquence, genius may exist without a classical 
training; the critical sense and a sound feeling for the relativity of 
meaning rarely, if ever. . .:. The law 1s the only discipline compar- 
able to the classics in this regard.” Shorey asserts that the critical in- 
terpretation or translation of one of the older languages “ supplies the 
simplest and most effective all-round discipline of the greatest number 
of faculties.” Because of its disciplinary and cultural value and its 
content, “Latin is a necessity in anything but an elementary or purely 
technical education. Greek is not in this sense a necessity, it is the 
first of luxuries.”’ 
The question of educational values has an important 
bearing on the desirability of a free elective system. If, 
as it appears, certain studies are worth more Ts diced 
than others, and itis not a matter of indifference sary to 
from thé standpoint of mental discipline whether Si nee as 
the student elects, for example, Latin, mathe- elective 
matics, philosophy, and chemistry on the one iti 
hand, or short stories, elementary agriculture, woodshop, 
and bird study on the other, the elective system in its ex- 
treme form must be modified. Indeed, this has been done 
in many institutions where a group elective system is in use. 
There are signs from various quarters that there are likely to be 
framed further restrictions to prevent the student from taking just what 
suits his tastes, fancy, or convenience in a perfectly irresponsible way, 
in spite of the opposite tendency to extend the elective system into the 
secondary schools, and the insistence by certain persons that any course 
the pupil takes and passes in the high school should be accepted by 
the college and university without further question, as entrance credits, 
on the apparent assumption that any one study is as good as any other » 
for mental discipline. That there is danger in such a tendency need 
not be further emphasized in the light of the foregoing discussion. 
Just at present the most important controversy concern- 
ing educational values is being carried on between those 
who advocate the advantages of applied science, and those 
who hold to the greater advantage of pure science. The

proper solution of the relative importance of these two 
spheres of human knowledge will doubtless have much to 
do with the development of the most valuable curriculum 
of studies in our secondary schools and colleges. The com- 
parative It would seem that, at least as far as mental disci- 
value of : : . ae cuaand of Pine ig concerned, pure science has much in its 
applied favor as a subject of instruction. Ina recent 
science. —-_ volume on Educational Values, Bagley emphasizes 
the probable superiority of pure mathematics over applied 
mathematics with its utilitarian ends which tend to color 
every other consideration ; thus obscuring the ideals of 
accuracy and rigidity that the pure science teaches. 
“Applied mathematics,” says Bagley, “ will inevitably de- 
mand quantity rather than quality. ... With the better 
and more intelligent students, the discipline may come in 
spite of haste. With the average student, the longer and 
more penetrating processes from which the perception of 
the unique values of mathematical reasoning will emerge, 
will be omitted.” What is true in regard to pure mathe- 
matics as compared with applied mathematics is true in 
regard to other pure sciences as compared with other ap- 
plied sciences. The application of a science tends to em- 
phasize certain human values more or less remote from the 
value of the science as science; hence, to restrict the field 
of the inquiry to those phases of the science that seem to 
relate most definitely to economic and other more or less 
narrow human values. With this point of view the in- 
vestigator is apt not only to lose the ideals of rigidity 
which Bagley points out, but also the ideals of truth merely 
as truth; truth that is self-sufficient and confident, that 
knows that whatever is true is human and whatever is un- 
true or partially true can never have ultimate worth in 
human experience. This ideal, gained in one pure science 
and made a conscious end of endeavor in all fields of 
human experience, has a rich promise for the future. In 
general the great discoveries of science have been made 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
Conclusions in Regard to the Transfer of Training 249 
by those who were primarily scientists; who were domi 
nated in their actions by the scientific ideal. Applied 
science as a rule comes later than pure science. It uses 
the results of a Helmholtz, who invented the ophthalmo- 
scope as a toy, or of a Darwin, who in the spirit of scientific 
curiosity collected data from which developed the theory of 
evolution, with its countless applications to human life. 
The mere facts of science are worth much; relatively less, 
however, in the first years of study before specialization 
has begun in the technical school or university; but the 
fact as fact has slight disciplinary value unless from it 
grows the spirit of curiosity, the emotional ideal, which the 
Greeks realized gave birth to all knowledge, and through 
which modern education has achieved such results. 
Those who believe in the absolute necessity of cultivating the scien- 
tific ideal in all its purity should not despair because of the evident trend 
of the education of the day in the direction of utilitarian, particularly 
economic ends. The history of education shows clearly that applied 
and pure science bear a reciprocal relation, and in the end the emphasis 
of the one leads to the emphasis of the other. Before they have gone 
far, the advocates of applied science are brought to a realization of the 
fact that they must seek the assistance of pure science, if they are to 
get practical results; on the other hand, the supporters of pure science 
sooner or later must feel the need of applying theory to practice. A 
science that has no human significance, that has no ultimate use, can- 
not exist in a world of human values. An interesting example of the 
development of applied science in the direction of pure science is found 
in the tendency of the great universities of the Middle West, founded 
for the most part for practical reasons, to establish higher schools of 
pure science and research. On the other hand, some of the Eastern 
institutions whose ideals have for generations been cultural and scien- 
tific have felt the necessity of establishment schools of engineering and 
commerce. 
We may then conclude that pure science is of greater 
disciplinary value, because (1) through the facts which it 
presents, ideals of procedure and of truth may be de-

in the curriculum. The very multiplicity of the subjects 
that have enriched our programs offers a distraction, 
and furnishes a training in dispersed rather than concen- 
trated attention, a training which is not needed and should 
not be désired. The trend of popular opinion is such that

opinion is not on the whole sound; but let us see to it that

its just value. In this time of rapid change we need sanity

  CHAPTER XVII 
ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
THE word “attention” has been employed not only in pop- 
ular usage, but in psychology as well in various ways. At 
times it has been regarded as a power or faculty attention 
of the mind; it has been thought of as a char- an attribute 
acteristic of certain states of consciousness agi gen 
distinguished from others‘ it has beeninterpreted st#tes. 
as the sensations of muscular strain, accompanying adjust- 
ment to the object of attention, and again as a feeling 
characterized chiefly by interest.1 Obviously some of 
these descriptions of attention are quite inadequate from 
the standpoint of modern psychology. For example, we 
cannot regard attention as a special power of the mind, since 
such terms as powers and faculties have no significance in 
our present-day thinking. Neither can we think of atten- 
tion as a characteristic of certain states of consciousness 
as distinguishedfromothers. There is no state of conscious- 
ness that is completely inattentive. States of conscious- 
hess that are characterized as inattentive are only relatively 
so. Consciousness, following James, may be thought of 
in its successive phases as a series of waves with a crest, 
or focus, and a margin for each of these waves. This 
analogy is usually accepted as a fairly accurate description 
of the facts. (The focus of consciousness corresponds to. 
the state of attention, and the margin to the state of inat- 
tention. In states of concentrated attention, when the 
mind seems completely buried in its object, the crest of the 
wave rises very sharp and high, and there is little fringe. J 
We can think of the crest as becoming more and more

his “ Experimental Psychology,” Vol. I, Student’s Manual, pp. 108-109.

pointed, and at the same time the width of the wave as 
growing narrower and narrower, until at length it becomes 
a perpendicular line. The approximation to such a form 
of the conscious wave as this, would correspond in con- 
sciousness toa state of hypnosis or mono-ideism. However, 
the wave can never become this single line as long as 
consciousness remains. On the other hand, the crest of 
the wave may fall lower and lower, its width and those of 
the marginal states may grow more and more extended, 
until the wave approaches in form a single horizontal line. 
The approximation to such a form as this finds its corre- 
spondence in consciousness in dream states, semi-coma, and 
the like. Itis clear again that the form of the wave can 
only be an approximation to this horizontal line and still 
represent consciousness. Between these two phases of 
the wave, the one with the extremely high and sharp crest 
and narrow margin, and the other with the broad and low 
crest and greatly extended margin, the whole attentive 
process may vary, but there always must be a crest of some 
sort and a margin of some sort in any conscious state. 
From this point of view attention may be defined as an 
aspect of all states of consciousness in which a part of the 
a field is emphasized anda part relatively ignored. 
correlated 10 use Titchener’s words, we have in attentive 
oe consciousness an object or objects ‘attended 
to,” and an object or objects “attended from.” 
These two aspects of every conscious state are repre- 
\ sented on the objective side by differences in adjustment. 
We always adjust ourselves to the object of attention, and 
correspondingly we are out of adjustment to the object in the 
inattentive field) There seems to have been in the devel- 
opment of attention, both in the individual and in the race, 
an exact parallelism between adjustment as an objective 
factor and attention as its subjective correlate.! Ade- 
1 Titchener holds that sensations of adjustment (kinzsthetic states of con- 
Sciousness) are not the invariable accompaniments of attention. “There
-P-A-G-E-277
  Attention and Interest a0 
quate adjustment corresponds to well-adapted attention, 
while inadequate adjustment represents that stage of con- 
sciousness which is characterized by fluctuation in atten- 
Hon, 2 adequate adjustment is here meant an adjustment 
which is working satisfactorily toward the mastery of a 
situation. It is to be distinguished from completed adjust- 
ment in which the situation is finally mastered. There 
are obviously ‘various stages of adequacy in adjustment, 
depending upon the degree to which the situation is being 
mastered, or the problem being solved. When a situation 
first presents itself in attention, it often happens that the 
means for its mastery are not completely known. Indeed, 
if they were so known, there would hardly be a situation, 
since the reactions could be carried out on the habitual 
plane. It is evident that the greater the lack of knowl- 
edge in regard to the control of the situation, the less the 
possibility of habitual reaction, the greater is the uncer- 
tainty in adjustment and the greater the thought crisis. 
It is at such times as this that the individual seeks for 
proper reaction, and under these conditions the attentive 
consciousness fluctuates from one aspect of the situation 
to another until a satisfactory set of reactions is hit upon, 
and then it is that the attention becomes concentrated, and 
the reactions effective. In cases of strong. emotional 
may be a widespread arousal of kinesthetic sensations, or there may be 
no sensible change of the muscular system; it depends upon circumstances.” 
However, biological considerations make it probable that there can be no at- 
tentive state that is not accompanied by sensations or images of bodily adjust- 
ments. We have already pointed out in our discussion of the manner in 
which the child obtains experiences of the external world, that mere sensa- 
tion is not sufficient to give him the idea of an object. A pure sensation is a 
hypothetical conscious process. In objectifying the sensation, we always ad- 
just ourselves to the object that arouses it. This is true in visual sensations. 
Mere passive touch could not acquaint us with objects; our whole idea of 
space is interwoven with kinesthetic sensations; a large number of our 
meanings are carried directly by kinzsthetic symbols, and finally all symbols 
of meaning must eventually be interpreted in terms of adjustment. (See 
Chapter V of this book, p. 73.)
-P-A-G-E-278
  254, The Learning Process 
excitement, where the situation offers no immediate means 
of solution, we have states of consciousness that are char- 
acterized by rapid shifts of the field of attention and by 
general confusion in the cognitive processes. On the 
other hand, when the problem is on the road to solution, 
when the adjustments are taking on definiteness and cohe- 
rence, then it is that the cognitive aspects of conscious- 
ness become clear and the thought processes effective. 
Attention then seems to be correlated with cognitive clear- 
ness s and with adequacy of adjustment on the one ha, one hand, and 
with affective intensi nt on 
the other. An illustration may serve to make this state- 
ment more definite. 
If I am sitting at my desk engaged in writing, my state of conscious- 
ness will be distributed between that which I am clearly and definitely 
aware of, in this case the ideal content of my thinking, and that which 
is but dimly and vaguely in the fringe of my consciousness, — the paper 
before me, the movement of the pencil over it, various indefinite noises 
coming from other parts of the house, the fragrance of flowers, as their 
odor comes through the open window, and so forth. Suddenly there 
comes the cry of fire, and my focus of attention shifts to the sounds from 
without. I notice also, clearly and definitely, the smell of smoke, and 
see puffs of smoke creeping through the door of my study. Up to this 
point the whole course of my consciousness may easily be described in 
terms of clearness. Suppose, however, when I open the door and rush 
out into the corridor, I find that the smoke has become stifling and 
that exit in that particular direction seems to be precluded. I turn 
back again to open my study door, but I find that the spring lock on it 
has closed it from within, and I have not my keys with me. Here my 
clear thinking for the time ends, and the states of consciousness 
which are mine are characterized by anything but definiteness and clear- 
ness. They are indefinitely intense. It would be entirely wrong to say, 
however, that in such a state of inadequate adjustment I am inattentive 
in the same sense that I was inattentive to the various sense stimuli 
that came to me when I was a few minutes ago sitting at my desk in 
the study and writing. This state of confusion exists until I, in my ex- 
citement, push strongly against the door to my study, and the lock 
yields, and I reénter the room. I then remember that at the open 
window there is a fire escape from which I can easily reach safety. 
The whole situation again becomes clear, my excitement disappears,
-P-A-G-E-279
Attention and Interest 255 | 
and I resume a state of consciousness in which attention is well adapted 
and adjustment adequate. . 
These considerations bring us face to face with the 
question of an adequate measure of attention. If,we think 
of a single phase of the conscious wave that w ge ies ices 
have previously discussed, we may say that th¢ an adequate 
nearer the focus of attention any object of con- ae 
sciousness is, the greater its clearness or vivid- 
ness, and the more in the margin it is, by so much less is 
it vivid and clear. This is practically the view adopted 
by Titchener, who considers clearness the only unvarying 
accompaniment of attention. However, when we consider 
various phases of the attentive consciousness and attempt 
to compare them, it is not so certain that we can maintain 
that those states which are characterized by the greatest 
clearness are therefore the most highly attentive. Certainly 
Titchener’s position is not applicable, if we limit ourselves 
in the use of the term “clearness” to clearness of meaning. ‘ 
In considering Titchener’s point of view in regard to the adequacy | 
of the criterion of clearness as a complete and satisfactory measure of 
attention, we should keep in mind the fact that he is discussing the 
attentive consciousness structurally. He is asking the question, what 
is the structure or pattern of any state of consciousness as far as it is 
attentive ? The fact, therefore, that the present discussion maintains 
that from certain points of view the concept of clearness is not wholly 
satisfactory as a measure of attention does not indicate more necessarily 
than that the structural treatment does not satisfy the demands of a 
functional consideration of consciousness. Titchener asks, what are 
the constituent elements of a conscious state ? The present discussion 
inquires, what is the significance of certain conscious states in relation 
to the total onflowing of consciousness, particularly as it is exemplified 
in the learning process? Titchener, in following out his conception, 
describes the attentive consciousness as made up of a graded series, 
ranging from maximal to minimal clearness. Every sensation may be 
placed on this graded scale at some point, since clearness is an attribute, 
an unvarying accompaniment, of every sensation. This kind of clear- 
ness Titchener terms “attributive clearness.” Attributive clearness is, in 
this sense of the term, meaningless fact. It is not a clearness due to 
, the relation of the sensory experience to anything else. It is the pri- 
'   
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  256 | The Learning Process 
mary equipment of all sensation as such before it has acquired meaning. 
A noise that I do not recognize, a scrawl that I fail to interpret, has 
some degree of attributive clearness, but no clearness due to its context 
or setting. The second kind of clearness, clearness of relation or 
meaning, is termed “ cognitive clearness.” Such clearness is considered 
by Titchener not as an attribute of the sensation, since it arises only as 
sensations become related and acquire significance. Therefore this 
variety of clearness is not a matter of the structure of the attentive con- 
sciousness, but of its function. These two kinds of clearness are quite 
different. Indeed, there is no necessary relation between them. Ac- 
cording to Titchener, a state of consciousness may be attributively clear, 
and cognitively unclear, or the opposite.? 
From the standpoint of the discussion of the learning process, it is 
scarcely possible to consider what Titchener terms attributive clearness. 
As has been stated in the chapter on sensation there is no warrant for 
the present discussion considering sensation as an isolated fact. Sen- 
sations only as they enter into relations and develop in the onflow of 
consciousness in terms of meaning or purpose are legitimate data for a 
functional psychology. Whenever we seek in the actual conscious 
process to find a sensation, we already discover something tinged with 
meaning. There is no meaningless fact. The slightest noise, the 
most unpromising scrawl, the merest glint of color, is still noise, or 
scrawl, or color, and thus has a meaning and a degree of cognitive clear- 
ness. For functional psychology, too, the sensation does not exist as 
something independent of its relations. These relations change it and 
make itover. A sensation recognized as a mere noise is not the same 
- sensation as when it is later recognized as a musical note; it again 
changes its sensory character when the note is recognized as a bugle 
call; and still again it undergoes transformation when the bugle call is 
identified as that ofaparticular company. So the same original impres- 
sion can continue to develop and change its character, as meanings de- 
velop and cognitive clearness becomes greater. 
But in this process of development there is no stage so low that 
cognitive clearness is entirely absent; no stage so advanced that cogni- 
tive clearness has reached its maximum until the problem is finally 
solved. What seems to beattributive clearness at one stage of the proc- 
ess has been achieved by cognitive clearness ata previous stage. For 
1 The above outline of Titchener’s position I have deduced in part from 
his published statements, but chiefly from a personal correspondence in regard 
to the matter. The chief differences in treatment between Titchener and 
myself lie apparently in difference of fundamental conceptions that make the 
two points of view difficult to compare.
-P-A-G-E-281
  Atiention and Interest 257 
example, the sound which now stands out, clear in this particular mo- 
ment of consciousness, as a bugle call, and which seems to be merely 
clear in itself, and not because of a cognized relation to anything 
beyond, has attained this character of clearness because of previous in- 
stances in which the sound has been cognized. It has become attribu- 
tively clear, when in an earlier experience it was merely cognitively 
clear. It is what it is, even as a sensation, because of such experiences 
that have developed in all their cognitive relations. Thus, whileit may be 
serviceable in any given phase of consciousness to characterize the sen- 
sory and ideational elements as attributively clear, from the standpoint 
of functional psychology, which considers not what these elements are 
as given, but inquires into their origin and into their significance in the 
development of the thought processes, such a characterization seems not 
only useless, but, in the very nature of the case, impossible. 
The foregoing then leads us to the conclusion that the 
only kind of clearness that the present discussion is war- 
ranted in considering is clearness of meaning. But clear- 
ness of meaning may be of avery low grade, and the 
attention of a high grade, or the opposite. 
It seems, therefore, that in cases of strong emotional ex- 
citement at least, when we are confronted by situations in 
which we can find no-direct and sufficient adjustment, that 
our attitude, while still ne attentive, may be anything 
but cognitively clear 
rom this point of view, it is more satisfactory to think 
of attention as being constituted of two elements, the rela- 
tive prominence of either of which is determined attention 
by the degree of adequacy of the adjustment to oe pyres 
the situation which calls forth the attentive con- affective in 
sciousness. When the adjustment is being ade- its nature. 
quately and rapidly carried out, there is a large degree of 
clearness, and the affective element is in the margin of con- 
1 Whether the sensations at these times, as mere sensations, are clear, falls 
outside the scope of the present discussion. Titchener would maintain that 
since they are focal, they must of necessity be clear. However, in such a sit- . 
uation as this, the focal elements give the general impression of confusion 
and bewilderment. Perhaps they might better be described as attributively 
vivid.

sciousness to such an extent that at times its presence 
entirely escapes observation. There are other occasions, 
however, when the affective elements are prominent, and 
when these seem to “swamp” the clear, intellectual con- 
tent. Here, as we have seen, we have states of strong 
emotional excitement, when the clearness of ideational 
content has almost vanished, while, on the other hand, 
we may have states of calm deliberation and considera- 
tion that seem cold, colorless, and non-affective. Clear- 
ness and affective intensity both become elements in the 
solution of a problem; they are relative to it; they repre- 
sent various phases in the progressive solution of the 
problem. Generally speaking, as the problem becomes 
clearer, the means of solution more definite, their relation 
- to the total thought content more exactly determined, the 
intensity of affection subsides, becomes more a matter of 
the margin, until in the end as the problem reaches a solu- 
tion, the clearness has reached a maximum and the af- 
fective element a minimum. It seems that the attentive 
consciousness moves between two extremes; at one we 
may have a high intensity of affective consciousness with 
slight meaning, and, therefore, little clearness. If the 
attentive state progresses normally, relations are gradually 
formed, meanings arise, and clearness grows. When the 
problem is solved, this movement in the attentive con- 
sciousness ceases, and the whole drops into the inattentive 
field. Asaresult of this solution, and in consequence of 
the completed adjustment, there then appears in affective 
consciousness a glow of satisfaction, which, as a distinctly 
pleasurable state, stamps with approval the entire process 
of adjustment so completed, and assures its repetition when 
again a similar situation arises. Of course, it is quite ob- 
vious that every state of attentive consciousness does not 
run this entire course. However, when we measure the 
degree of attention in any phase of this course, as com- 
pared with any other phase, either preceding or following,
-P-A-G-E-283
  Attention and Interest 259 
we must take into consideration, not only the intellectual 
aspect of consciousness, which is the essence of clearness, 
but likewise the affective aspect that determines the inten- 
sity.- Thus from the functional viewpoint, we can hardly 
assume that states of attention entirely devoid of the affec- 
tive element can exist. 
Psychology distinguishes, gendrally, various forms or 
aspects of attentive consciousness. One of the principal 
distinctions is between active and passive atten- 1, . 4: 
tion. Active attention is generally thought of tinction 
as_that fo form of attention which is due to the Petween active and 
rf will pow power,’ of the person who exercises it, passive 
while in passive attention _it_is supposed that ereneoe: 
the person attending, wi is_own, is 
impressed with the object. his consciousness. A 
favorite way of expressing this difference from a peda- 
gogical point of view is that in active attention the mind 
goes out and seizes the object, while in passive attention 
the object seizes or takes possession of the mind. This is 
a mere simile, and contains certain assumptions that are 
untenable from the standpoint of theoretical psychology, 
and may become dangerous from the standpoint of practi- 
cal pedagogy. Further, it is to be observed that if we con- 
ceive active and passive attention in terms of will power, 
or the lack of it, we are making an error in assuming such 
a power or force to exist, and are really interpreting our 
problem in terms of the outgrown and discarded “faculty” 
psychology. We must get another and more valid distinc- 
tion between these two forms of attention, if we wish to 
be true to the facts of psychology, and also to find a ser- 
viceable point of view from which to work out our educa- 
tional procedure. 
The di wo forms of attention can 
be stated in two ways. Firgt, objectively, in terms of ad- 
justment, and second;-subjeetively, in terms of mental con- 
tent. ~ The great difference between active and passive

The dis- = attention in-terms of-adjustment is that tinction in 
termsof ' in the former there are tendencies _ of _adjust- 
adjustment ment that lie o we and of 
mentalcon- are paying attention, while in the latter the en- 
ae tire adjustment is confined tothe object itself. 
A concrete illustration will serve to make clear this distinction. A 
child is sitting at his desk in the schoolroom, engaged in number work. 
If he is giving passive attention, all his activities are centered in the 
arithmetical processes which he is performing. If, however, while he is 
at work, he hears the call of children on the street and tends to look 
out of the window, thus adjusting himself partially to some object which 
falls outside of the problem at hand, but still partly or wholly inhibiting 
this tendency to turn away from his work, he is giving active attention. 
On the subjective side the difference between these two 
forms of attention is to be found in the fact that in pas- 
sive attention there are no evidences of distraction, no sen- 
sations of strain, or feelings of dissatisfaction in attending 
to the object before us. On the other hand, in active at- 
tention we get distinct impressions of tendencies that lead 
us away from the work at hand. These come often as al- 
lurements, and sometimes as distractions in the form of the 
fatigue accompanying concentrated attention, or of sense 
stimuli which cause our attention to fluctuate between the 
object which claims our thought and others that make de- 
mands on our interests. We have the feeling all the time 
that we must “bring” ourselves to attend to the object at 
hand. We areconscious of the expenditure of what seems 
to be to us “psychic energy,” but which is rather a con- 
sciousness'‘of conflicts in muscular adjustments. This gives 
us the impression of voluntary effort, and for this reason 
  
> 
active attention is often given the name of voluntary 
attention. 
Active attention in its most primitive forms, where it 
takes place on the lower levels of learning, consists in the 
fluctuation of attention between various objects of sensa- 
tion, among which one of these by its greater vividness or
-P-A-G-E-285
  Attention and Interest 261 
interest calls forth predominatingly the attentive attitude. 
In.all higher forms of the learning process, however, active 
attention arises because of the conflict between im- 4 4.4 
mediate and present ends and remote and tdeal attention 3 d emphasizes 
ends. For example, I hold my attention to the remote 
problem before me in spite of various sensory ends. 
allurements and distractions, because of the desire to work 
it through to its ultimate conclusion. I have here in mind 
a remote, rather than an immediate end. It is for this 
reason that animals and little children, who live almost en- 
tirely, if not completely, within the round of immediate 
experience, have no ability to give active attention. 
Bagley, in his “Classroom Management”?! has drawn the clearest 
and most helpful distinction between these two forms of attention, to 
be found in the literature on the subject. He says in part: “ When- 
ever attention is determined by an end that is consciously beyond the 
needs of the moment, whenever present desires and impulses are inhib- 
ited or suppressed for the sake of some remote end to be gained, a strug- 
gle is inevitable between the thing that one knows one should attend to 
and the thing one knows one should not attend to. It is clear that, in 
general, the nearer the end, the more likelihood that it will win out over 
the momentary impulse. It is also clear that, the more vivid the image 
of the end to be reached, the more likelihood that the momentary im- 
pulse will be defeated. Likewise, the more highly the end is tinged 
with desire or positive emotional force, again the greater likelihood 
that it will be victorious in its’ struggles. All of these principles are 
simple correlaries of the general law; they are practically axiomatic; 
and yet it is safe to say that no principles so fundamental as these have 
been so woefully neglected in educational practice.” The value of these 
remote ends, as contrasted with the immediate tendencies and desires 
in determining the proper reaction of the individual to his environment, 
need hardly to be commented on. It is these that distinguish largely — 
the learning processes of man from those of the brute, and which make 
possible the whole scheme of human progress. 
Beside active and passive attention, there is a third form 
which is known as secondary passive attention, and which 
Bagley makes of prime importance _as_an end of instruc-

  The Learning Process” 
  tion. It is a well known fact that many of those things 
which we attend to only with a feeling of reluctance at the 
ei. start, and which require a large amount of active 
passive attention, are ultimately attended to spontane- 
attention. ously. The young man who at the beginning 
of his business career goes to his work in the morning with 
reluctance, later on at maturity is entirely absorbed in its 
details. He cannot leave for a vacation, and even perhaps 
on Sundays and holidays we find him in the office, busily 
absorbed initsinterests. The greatreason for this change 
of attitude isdue to habit. It is a common experience that 
many things which we attend to at first only with effort, 
gradually acquire an interest which they did not originally 
possess. As Bagley puts it, ““We become habituated in 
course of time to almost anything that we persevere in, no 
matter how disagreeable that thing may have been at the 
outset. That is, the inhibition of distracting impulses be- 
comes a habit, becomes unconscious.” 
Titchener ! distinguishes three kinds of attention, as fol- 
lows : — 
“ Attention appears in the human mind in three stages of development ; 
as primary attention, determined by various influences that are able to 
produce a powerful effect on the nervous system; as secondary atten- 
tion, during which the center of consciousness is held by a certain per- 
ception or idea, but is held in face of opposition; and lastly, as derived 
primary attention, when the perception or idea has gained an undisputed 
ascendency over its rivals. The attentive consciousness is at first sim- 
ple; it then becomes complex, — reaching, indeed, in cases of hesitation 
and deliberation, a very high degree of complexity ; and then it simpli- 
fies again. Looking at life in the large, we may say that the period of 
training or education isa period of secondary attention, and that the follow- 
ing period of achievement and mastery is a period of derived primary 
attention. Looking at experience more in detail, we see that education 
itself consists, psychologically, in the alternation of the two attentions ; 
habit is made the basis of further acquisition, and acquisition, gained 
with pains, passes in its turn into habit; the cycle recurs, so long as the 
organism retains its nervous plasticity. Secondary attention thus ap-

pears, everywhere, asa stage of transition, of conflict, of waste of nervous 
energy, though it appears at the same time as the necessary preliminary 
to a stage of real knowledge.” 
The most primitive learning is built obviously upon this 
primary form of attention, and is due to inherited tenden- 
cies to attend. The young child and animal primary 
alike spontaneously give attention to intense attention in 
stimuli, like loud noises and brilliant lights; to rea en 
stimuli that recur again and again, thus impress- &2¢e- 
ing themselves by repetition; to stimuli that come suddenly, 
producing marked changes in the environmental conditions; 
to stimuli in movement, to strange and unusual stimuli, and 
to stimuli falling in rhythm and cadence, as well as to all 
stimuli that make known organic needs. The organism 
has no interest in many of these stimuli in the ordinary 
sense of the word. Indeed, in adult life such stimuli call 
forth attention in opposition to interests, as, for example, 
when a person who is listening attentively to a lecturer 
turns suddenly when he hears a door opening or a person 
walking across theroom. In another sense, however, these 
forms of attention are based upon racial needs and biologi- 
cal interests. Intense stimuli and often repeated stimuli 
are so imperative in their nature that, generally speaking, 
the organism is compelled, in the more rudimentary forms of 
struggle for existence, to take account of them if it sur- 
vives. Novel stimuli, too, are important in the struggle 
for existence, and must be recognized in the more primitive 
forms of life. 
Kuhlmann? in his study on the development of instincts in young 
birds has shown that the original reaction of the animal to the stimuli 
of the environment is one of fear, and that it gradually learns, by be- 
coming accustomed to the stimuli, in so far as they are not harmful, not 
to fear them. Ifthe reaction of the animal to those things to which, he 
is unaccustomed were one of indifference, in which attention was slight

  264 The Learning Process 
or in which there was no attentive consciousness at all, he would 
shortly be eliminated in the struggle for existence. 
It is scarcely necessary to comment on the fact that 
attention to organic needs is a sive qua non of survival. 
These instinctive interests which call forth the attention 
are so persistent that never can they be entirely ignored, 
not even in mature life; and in school instruction they 
must often be utilized when other means of securing at- 
tention fail. 
A distinction is sometimes made between sensorial and 
ideational attention. Sensorial attention is that which we 
give to the sensory stimulus, while ideational at- 
en tention is that which we give to an ideational 
tional atten- Content. The former variety of attention is tion. o. | eihe ° ey: 
primitive, while the ability to develop the latter 
conditions the learning process in all its higher stages. 
It is not to be supposed, however, that in ideational atten- 
tion we are dealing with materials that have divorced them- 
selves entirely from a world of concrete reality. If the 
ideational content is to prove itself effective, it must have 
sufficient definiteness and clearness to bring about an 
adequate adjustment. Otherwise, it will be impossible for 
this ideal content to be held in mind long enough to secure 
the adjustment of which it is a symbol. 
An important problem presents itself concerning the rela- 
tion between attention and interest. Here two questions 
The teacher 211S¢ at the outset. First, are we always inter- 
must find ested in those objects and occurrences to which 
OS a we pay attention; and, second, do we always 
forth atten- pay attention to those things in which we are 
Kicml interested? From the biological viewpoint, we 
would naturally expect those things which are uninterest- 
ing to drop out of consciousness. Nevertheless, introspec- 
tion seems to indicate that there are many objects that 
come into the focus of our consciousness, but to which we 
are indifferent. Some of these, indeed, are objects which
-P-A-G-E-289
    Attention and Interest 265 
may be said to possess not an individual, but a racial 
interest. | 
Every teacher has, doubtless, had the experience of observing mem- 
bers of his class grow less and less attentive to the lesson or lecture at 
hand, until perhaps he has walked across the room, or turned to the 
blackboard, or manipulated a piece of apparatus; whereupon the wan- 
dering attention would come back, and for a few minutes, at least, there 
would seem to be a genuine interest in what was being done. Such 
experiences as these clearly indicate the inherent force of these elemen- 
tary forms of attention. 
There are many occurrences which claim the attention 
from time to time that do not seem to possess the racial 
interest above pointed out, and that seem further to be 
without individual interest. A careful examination of most 
of these will probably reveal the fact that while they are 
not interesting in themselves, they possess interest in con- 
nection with a broader situation. 
I may, for example, find the task of composition, on its mechanical 
side, entirely uninteresting, or even a bore, and yet I may pay attention 
to it, because of my wider interest in the end toward which my thought 
processes are working. There are always innumerable minor details in 
every occupation in which we engage, never mind how enthusiastically 
we enter into it, that are decidedly distasteful until they have become 
matters of habit, when they cease to have any affective value whatso- 
ever. We attend to these only because they link themselves up to 
wider interests, or because habits themselves, as far as consciousness 
enters into them at all, become pleasurable through sheer repetition. 
It is true that, as Titchener says in discussing this matter, we may greet 
a friend with an absorbed interest, “with pleasurable concern or with 
foreboding unpleasantness ; but we may also give hima perfunctory and 
mechanical attention, which leaves us wholly unaffected.” This is, 
however, hardly the whole statement of the case. If I pay attention to 
him at all, it is because I have some interest in so doing, unless I do it 
entirely on the habitual and non-conscious plane, in which case it would 
not be fair to characterize my mental attitude (or rather lack of mental 
attitude) as attentive. I may not have, it is true, the slightest interest 
in greeting Aimat this particular time, and yet I have a wider interest 
which makes me react toward the total situation of which he is a part. 
This wider interest may be my desire to observe the ordinary social con- 
vention, or it may be my wish to conceal from him that I am not pare

  266 The Learning Process 
ticularly pleased to see him on the occasion under discussion. It may 
be still something else, more remote ; but, nevertheless, I cannot believe 
but that there is some incentive that leads me to attend at all. 
If there are states of absolutely colorless attention, they 
are so rare that they can be ignored for all practical pur- 
poses; and educational psychology and applied pedagogy : 
can with confidence adopt the maxim, “‘ There is no phase 
of attention that is not accompanied by some positive or 
negative state of affection.” Itis asafe statement to make 
that attention cannot be secured and held unless the object 
attended to possesses either an immediate or a derived interest 
of some sort. 
If we consider the second question which we have raised, 
as to the possibility of interesting objects and events being 
We attend Passed by without attention, we can reply with 
to what certainty that such a possibility is contrary to 
interests us- Our general experience. Of course, it some- 
times happens that there is a conflict of interests, and in 
this case matters of minor interest fall out of attention 
because of the fact that other matters possess a greater 
interest. This circumstance, however, in no way disproves 
the statement that we invariably attend to what interests 
us. It would, therefore, seem safe to assert that for all 
practical purposes interest and attention go hand in hand. 
Wherever there is attention there will be found some form 
of interest; and on the other hand, wherever there is interest, 
attention is bound to follow. The pedagogical significance 
of this principle is perhaps obvious. It will, however, be 
commented on more extensively later.

CHAPTER XVIII i 
ATTENTION IN RELATION TO LEARNING 
EXPERIMENTAL psychology has brought out many interest- 
ing facts in regard to attention that have obvious bearings 
on educational theories and practices. Some of The range 
these may be stated as laws of attention. One of attention 
of these is that the range of attention is limited. ** “mite¢- 
We cannot pay attention to many different things at the 
same time, and if we appear to do this, it is because we 
attend to these various things in different phases of atten- 
tion. Itis difficult to determine how many different things 
we can attend to in a single moment of consciousness. 
This difficulty is largely due to the fact that the meaning 
of a single thing varies under different conditions. 
For example, written characters may be quite different if they are 
characters in the Chinese alphabet, or in an artificially constructed set 
of nonsense characters, from what they would be as letters in a familiar 
alphabet. We can grasp but a few of these nonsense characters in a 
single pulse of attention. On the other hand, letters of the English 
alphabet, if constructed into words and sentences, may be grasped in 
considerable numbers ina single phase of attention, because they are 
brought together in a meaningful unity. 
It is safe to say that all the elements that may be grasped 
together in one pulse of attention, fit together in some general 
way, the greater the similarity, for the purpose at hand, the 
greater our experience with them, the more we can grasp in 
any one instant. 
Experiments have shown that attention comes in waves; 
it tends to take a rhythmical form. If, when seated in a Z 
quiet room, you observe the ticking of a watch ,. 
removed to the limits of audibility, you will notice comes in 
that at times you will distinctly hear the watch, : ie 
and at others it will appear to be silent. This is 
not because there is any change in the strength of the tick. 
267 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  268 The Learning Process 
ing, but it is because your attention ebbs and flows. Fur- 
ther, experiments have shown that these briefer waves of a 
few seconds’ duration are parts of longer ones covering 
periods of perhaps hours. 
As Seashore! has stated it, “ There are infinitely short ripplets of 
attention hardly perceptible; these form the surface of ripples, which in 
turn form the surface of wavelets; and these wavelets, in turn, form the 
surface of the wave, and so on. Thus, all attention is rhythmic, and 
there is a rhythm within rhythm, from the infinitesimally short to the 
very long, even daily and annual periodicities.” This rhythmic form of 
attention is, doubtless, in part, at least, to be explained on physiological 
grounds. It seems to be interwoven into our very beings, and doubt- 
less explains why those external stimuli that come in a rhythmic form 
are so important from the standpoint of primary attention. 
The relation between certain bodily attitudes and atten- 
tion has likewise been emphasized in experimental psychol- 
Sis ogy. These bodily attitudes come in the form 
accompani- Of either incipient or fully expressed motor 
ments of © accompaniments that seem to be essential to the attention. ; ; ; 
attentive consciousness itself. This, of course, 
is as we should expect, from the point of view which we 
have held to throughout this discussion, namely, that atten- 
tion is the subjective correlate of adaptation, or adjustment 
to a situation.2, Some of the adjustments that accompany 
the attentive attitude are: (1) The adaptation of the sense 
organs, to give the greatest clearness and distinctness to 
the stimulus attendedto. For example, the accommodation 
and the convergence of the eyes on the object that is to be 
brought into clear vision, or the turning of the head and 
the adjustment of the ear to sounds to which the person is 
listening. (2) The placing of the body in such a position 
as most advantageously to receive the stimulus; for 
example, the craning of the neck and bending forward to 
catch the least sound or the slightest visual appearance. 
(3) The inhibition, to a certain extent, of the breathing

-P-A-G-E-293
  Attention in Relation to Learning 269 
and changes in circulation; for example, holding the 
breath, and becoming absolutely quiet, when listening 
attentively. Without the proper attitude, it is very difficult, 
sometimes impossible, to give any attention whatsoever. 
These mechanical aspects of attention must be carefully 
considered in order to secure the highest degree of concen- 
tration in the work of the school. 
Experiments have further been conducted on the relation 
between attention and distraction. It is found, in general, 
that if a distraction comes with regularity, and ° ° ° The rela- continues for some time, the attention soon tion pe- 
adapts itself to this condition, so that no unfavor- tween at- , tention and 
able effects are experienced. distraction. 
Newspaper writers, for example, find at first the din and confusion of 
‘the office so distracting that they can do but little work. Ina short 
time, however, they are able to ignore these distractions entirely, and in 
the end become so accustomed to them that they do their best work 
only when they hear the click of the typewriter and the telegraph key 
and the hum of conversation. 
It has also been found, by experimental tests and through 
general observation, that the most concentrated forms of 
attention are not always secured through absolute freedom 
from distraction. The explanation for this seemingly 
remarkable fact is to be found in the circumstance that in 
the presence of the distracting influence the person puts 
forth a greater amount of attention to overcome the adverse 
conditions. This increase in attention is more than suffi- 
cient to overcome the injurious effects of the distraction, 
and hence a positive increase in attention is thus secured. 
In general, it seems to be true that che optimal conditions 
for intellectual work are not always those that ideally seem 
to be the most satisfactory. The tncentive of having certain 
difficulties to overcome often leads to a total accomplishment 
that would not be secured tf these obstacles did not exist. 
Various attempts have been made to measure attention, 
but none of these has proved entirely successful. In fact,
-P-A-G-E-294
  270 The Learning Process 
attention has not itself been measured, but rather the ac. 
companiments of attention.1 Among the various methods 
employed for the measurement is the record of 
ee of the uniformity or lack of uniformity in a given 
measuring activity. If there are wide fluctuations in this attention. ie oF 
activity, it is assumed that these are due to 
periods of inattention. If, on the other hand; the activity 
proceeds without marked fluctuation, it is assumed that 
the attention is well and continuously adapted to the task 
on hand. Obviously, a high grade of mental work cannot 
be carried on when attention is constantly relaxing and 
the mind is turning away from the problem. A second 
method of measurement is to note whether a person en- 
gaged in a given activity is easily distracted or not. The 
intensity of the attention is supposed to be in proportion 
(to the difficulty of turning it in some new direction. The 
evidence for distraction in this test is found in the relative 
deterioration of the efficiency with which the person per- 
forms his work. Both of these methods are capable of 
application in the schoolroom, and, assuming that they 
have validity, a considerable amount of data can be col- 
lected in regard to those distracting influences that decrease 
the efficiency of the pupil. The practical value of such 
data, if they are significant, would be considerable, since 
it is obviously a tremendous waste in learning to work 
except under the most advantageous concentration of at- 
tention. The consideration of attention, and the distrac- 
tions which occur in active attention, bring us at once to 
the problem of mental fatigue. 
The term “mental fatigue” is used with great inexact- 
ness, but may be taken, in general, to denote that sort of 
fatigue that is the accompaniment of mental work. In 
1In the Cornell laboratory Geissler has attempted to devise an accurate 
method for measuring attention which may accomplish something definite in 
this direction. See Amer. Jour. of Psychol, XX, pp. 120-130; also 473-529 
(1909).
-P-A-G-E-295
Attention in Relation to Learning 271 
this sense the term “ mental fatigue” is to be distinguished 
from physical fatigue, which arises in connection with phys- 
ical work. Most writers on the subject, how- pjctinction 
ever, use mental fatigue also to denote nervous between : as ‘ ; mental and 
fatigue as distinguished from muscular fatigue. physical 
It is obvious that these two meanings of the term fatigue. 
are by no means identical. Mental fatigue in the first sense 
of the term, including all fatigue that arises in connection 
with mental work, denotes muscular as well as nervous 
fatigue. A large amount of so-called mental fatigue is | 
probably due to sensations of muscular strain that accom- 
pany the processes of adjustment during active attention. 
It may be questioned whether there are any actual sensa- 
tions that arise from nervous fatigue under ordinary cir- 
cumstances. When we feel tired as a result of mental 
work, it is because in most instances we sense the weari- 
ness of the muscles that function in accommodation and 
convergence of the eyes and of the muscles of the neck - 
and forehead, as well as of the trunk and other parts of 
the body. This fatigue is not so pronounced or so general 
as that connected with physical work, but it is different 
rather in degree and intensity than in kind. — It is also true 
that no small part of that which ordinarily passes for men- 
tal fatigue is not fatigue in any genuine sense of the term 
(z.e. of exhaustion), but is rather distaste for the work at 
hand, and a desire to follow out more attractive activities that 
continually lure us from our task. Ordinarily, we are not 
so much tired by our work as “tired of? ourwork. When 
nervous fatigue has really reached the point where its 
effects are discernible by the subject experiencing them, 
he is in a condition more or less serious. Indeed, the 
signs of nervous fatigue sometimes do not appear until the 
patient has reached the stage of complete nervous ex- 
haustion. 
The cause of fatigue, whether muscular or nervous, is 
according to a widely accepted theory due to the deposit 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  272 The Learning Process 
of poisonous by-products arising from the metabolic pro 
cesses in the muscles and the nerve cells. These poi 
|| Sons act as a protection, especially in the case 
mon view Of muscular work, and prevent an excessive ex- 
i ie oo" penditure of physiological energy, which would 
prove injurious to the organism. If a muscle 
has been active continuously for some time, fatigue sets in, 
and it is incapable longer of contracting in response to the 
innervation of the nervous centers. If this same muscle, 
however, is washed out, so that the products of metabolism 
are carried away, it recovers from its fatigue, and is able 
again to perform work. Thorndike has suggested an in- 
teresting parallel to this washing out of the muscle in the 
case of so-called mental fatigue. Here the mind is capable 
of continuing its work when attention begins to flag by 
ignoring the sensations of weariness and various affective 
states accompanying them, and in this way, by refusing to 
pay attention to these distractions, in a sense washing 
them out of consciousness. 
Recently a second theory in regard to the nature of fa- 
tigue has been advanced by Sherrington,! McDougall,? 
Yoakum,? and others, which holds that all fa- The theory cf { 
of Sherring- tigue is neuro-muscular in its nature, involving 
ree both the muscles and the nerve cells. Its es- 
sential nature consists in the blocking of the paths of 
discharge in the nerve tracts at the joining of the neurones 
(at the synapses). This results, according to Yoakum, in 
the shifting of nervous coérdinations, and is accompanied 
by the shifting of attention in the conscious processes. 
These shifts of consciousness relieve the fatigue ; however, 
if they do not occur in a codrdinated system, but are scat-

tered and diffuse, a high degree of mental work is impos: 
sible. On the other hand, slight fluctuations of attention 
within a definitely codrdinated field can take place without 
injury to the thought processes. If there is not this mental 
organization, however, the thinking leads to no definite 
end, and is ineffectual. Here again we find emphasized 
the necessity for the control of the thought processes to- 
ward some definite end. This theory is well suited to a 
psychological explanation of the essential nature of fatigue, 
and fits the facts brought out in connection with mental 
fatigue more exactly than does the theory first discussed. 
However, the signs of fatigue are identical under either 
theory, and the methods of minimizing the effects of fa- 
tigue are not essentially different. Yet on the theory of 
Sherrington a more satisfactory treatment of the problem 
of fatigue in the schoolroom can be worked out. The 
pedagogical applications of this theory will be discussed 
in a subsequent paragraph. 
Various methods have been devised for determining 
mental fatigue, especially as it arises in connection with 
the work of the schoolroom. These tests may ental and 
be divided into two classes, mental tests and physical 
physical tests. The physical tests concern the oe 
pulse volume and pulse rate, the breathing, the ‘tigue. 
blood pressure, etc.; the algometer (pain sensitivity) test; 
the ergograph and dynamometer (muscular work and 
strength) tests; the tapping test (rate and accuracy of 
tapping); the zsthesiometer-compass test, and the like. 
This last-named test was first employed by Griesbach, and 
assumes that there is an essential relation between mental 
fatigue and the ability to discriminate sensory stimuli.? 
The greater the fatigue, the less is the test person able 
to distinguish two compass points when applied to the 
skin, as two. As fatigue increases, the points must be

separated more and more in order to obtain from the sub 
ject the judgment of duality. The assumption of Gries. 
bach has been seriously questioned by later investigators, 
with the result that it is no longer considered more than 
an indication of fatigue, and by no means an absolute meas- 
ure. The same may be said in general of the other physi- 
cal tests.! 
The mental tests aim to measure fatigue by determining 
the quality and quantity of mental work. The principal 
tests of this character are the adding test, the dictation test, 
and the memory test. Usually as fatigue sets in the 
quality of the work falls off before the quantity is affected. 
Indeed, for atime the quantity may be greater. As in the 
case of the tests for attention, the fatigue tests measure the 
accompaniments of fatigue rather than actual exhaustion. 
They do not distinguish between actual fatigue and con- 
comitant conditions such as wandering attention, lack of 
interest, ezuuz, and the like. They do, however, in a fair 
way measure the conditions under which the school work 
is done under various circumstances, and, therefore, as far” 
as they are accurate, have a significance for pedagogy. 
As can be seen from the foregoing, the question of the 
course of the work curve is closely connected with that of

the school day have been brought in question. Leuba (Psychol. Rev., VI, pp.

amount of attention to the character of this curve, and their 
results are significant. The work curve is a compound 
curve, made up of several factors, of which fatigue is the 
mostimportant. Another factor is due to the initial warm- 
ing-up and adaptation of attention. We seldom begin at 
our maximum. Then, too, if the work that we are engaged 
in is not purely habitual, we gain facility, if we continue it 
through a considerable period, by practice. We also tend 
to work by spurts. Further, we start in, as has been 
pointed out, with a considerable amount of interest in a 
new task, but rapidly or gradually this initial enthusiasm 
tends to run its course and disappear.’ There are three 
general types of the work curve for any one work period. A 
certain number of individuals, by no means the majority, 
do their best work at the beginning of the task. Others 
show improvement for a relatively brief period up to a 
maximum, then with certain fluctuations the work deteri- 
orates; still others, with slow adaptation of attention, but 
with slight tendencies toward fatigue, improve for a.con- 
siderable period and reach their maximum toward the end 
of the work period. Probably on the whole the second 
type of the curve is more common. The quantity of work 
that can be done at various periods of the day likewise 
seems subjected to individual variations. Some do their 
best work in the morning hours, while others reach their 
maximum later in the day. 
The most important results of various tests of the fatigue 
and exuuz accompanying school work may be summarized 
as follows :— ftiuslous

school children.. It is probable that the impor- “°°”

276 The Learning Process 
tance of the whole question of fatigue in the schools has 
been greatly overestimated, as far as its physiological re- 
sults are concerned.! As far as the mental effects go, how- 
ever, it is highly important to know under what conditions 
the most, effective learning can be accomplished, and it 
makes little difference to practical pedagogy whether the 
deterioration in work is to be traced to fatigue sensations 
or to mere exmuz and lack of interest. If such conditions 
exist, they must be remedied, whatever their cause. 
2. The most effective remedy for so-called mental fatigue, 
as it arises in the school, lies in a better adaptation of at- 
tention to the work at hand with a correspond- Well ; ‘ , ; . ,

fully to resist these distractions. Many abandon work 
after a short period because they have not habituated them- 
selves to ignore these conditions. Experiments by Sea- 
shore and Kent at the University of Iowa* and later by 
Thorndike at Columbia University ? seem to show that if 
these distracting influences are disregarded, mature stu- 
dents can continue mental work for hours with practically 
no diminution in efficiency. In other words, the curve for 
mental work, while it shows insignificant fluctuations, indi- 
cates no pronounced falling off for periods extending over 
hours. As far as adults are concerned, there is little 
reason to believe that they cannot continue for long con- 
secutive periods to do efficient mental work, if they have 
accustomed themselves to ignore incidental distractions and

to resist feelings of distaste that are sure to arise, particu- 
larly during the first part of their efforts. With children, 
however, the problem is somewhat different, and it is prob- 
ably unwise to demand as long periods of sustained work 
_as would be expected of mature pupils, both because of 
actual fatigue and because children have not accustomed 
themselves to ignore the accompanying exnuz that makes 
the work, after a short time, distasteful, and therefore, rela- 
tively ineffective. 
3. Pleasant work seems to be much less fatiguing 
than unpleasant. This fact has two explanations. Itisa 
physiological law, already pointed out in this pjeasant 
discussion, that pleasure tends to heighten the work less shee ; ; fatiguing 
activity of an organism and displeasure to lower than un- 
it; therefore, under conditions of pleasurable Pleasant. 
experience, the positive fatigue will be less than under 
conditions of unpleasant experience. Further, as we have 
already seen, the tests for fatigue do not distinguish be- 
tween physiological fatigue and mere dissatisfaction, or 
unwillingness to do the work, or lack of interest in it. 
The fact that the work is pleasant signifies that these 
latter factors do not exist, and for that reason the work is 
done under more favorable conditions. 
4. Physical work is apparently more fatiguing than 
mental work, “especially when the former is of a vigorous 
nature. Relief from the tedium of a~ school Pistia 
hour is not obtained by a period of gymnastics sian 
or similar exercises. Whether the fatigue be than al 
physical or mental, the most effective remedy Wr: 
has been held by many to be absolute rest. This state- 
ment may seem to run counter to the general experience 
that a person may relieve himself from the strain of 
mental work by walking or by other forms of mild exer- 
cise. The explanation of this seeming paradox is to be 
found in part in the fact that in mild exercise there are 
certain bodily effects of circulation and respiration that
-P-A-G-E-302
      
a The Learning Process 
are beneficial and more than counterbalance the fatigue | 
effects of the exercise. Also there is a shift in the locus 
of the fatigue sensations that is beneficial. Further, it is 
to be remembered that since a part of the mental fatigue 
is really due to loss of interest in the work, a change from 
mental to physical work offers a relief and removes the 
tedium. For this reason it is probably desirable in long 
periods of school work to change itd character from time 
to time, for although this change may not lessen actual 
fatigue, it creates a new interest that permits the work to 
be carried on more effectively.? 
5. On the whole, automatic learning seems to be less 
fatiguing than learning with sustained attention. This is 
to be explained by the fact that in automatic Automatic : : 
learning learning the process is conducted on the level 
less fa- of habit, and active attention is not required tiguing than : : ; 
learning to any considerable degree. Active attention, 
_ atten- while necessary in school work, is accompanied, 
as has already been said, by certain wastes in 
physical energy due to the distractions that arise in its 
course. The larger the number of subjects in the school 
that can be reduced in part to the plane of automatic 
learning, the greater the economy. For example, it is a 
tremendous waste of time in number work for the pupil to 
be obliged to reason out the multiplication table, or in 
composition to puzzle over the spelling of certain words 
that he should have at his command. 
6. In states of fatigue the mind seems less capable of 
forming associations. The whole learning process goes 
Associative back to a lower level, and the ideas that appear in 
a : consciousness are due rather to “ persistence” wearene . 
in states of than to meaning. In other words, work of any

| Attention in Relation to Learning 279 
plished when the person, because of fatigue or the general 
irksomeness of his task, is not able “to think.” Under 
such conditions, his mind is apt to be filled with irrelevant 
ideas, which come up, unbidden apparently, from the depths 
of his consciousness. 
7. Experiments seem to indicate that the afternoon 
hours are less favorable to school work than morning 
hours. Also, for many children the first hour ‘ ; orning 
of the school work is not so effective as those hours best 
immediately following. This is due, in part, to for School 
the fact that the warming-up process consumes 
time, and that attention is slow in adapting itself. It is 
also true that there is a natural letting up in the. work just 
before the close of school, at noon or in the afternoon, 
and before holidays and vacations. ‘This is to be explained 
rather because of the attitude of mind that the pupil brings 
than because of any real fatigue. It is safe to say that 
the most effective work in the school can be done in the 
middle morning hours, and that the afternoon work, on — 
the whole, should be of a nature less exacting than the 
morning work. 
8. The symptoms of mental fatigue in the sense of 
nervous exhaustion are quite different from those of the 
normal fatigue of an ordinary school day. If 
the child is not refreshed by his night’s sleep, mien a 
if he is nervous and irritable, if he cannot sit in @ serious 
an attitude of attention at his desk, at least part cite 
of the time, but lolls about, if his hands have a ee 
nervous droop when extended, and if he cannot 
stand erect with his eyes shut, if his face is flushed and 
his general attitude listless, and if, further, he shows on 
examination marked decrease in sensitivity, it is reasonable 
to conclude that he is a victim of grave nervous fatigue or 
some other similar disturbance. In this case, he is no longer 
a fit pupil to remain in the school, but requires special 
treatment. Cases of genuine fatigue that have reached

280 The Learning Process 
the pathological stage are often stubborn, and recovery is 
slow. The onset of such troubles should be taken note of 
at once by the teacher, and the pupil dealt with accordingly. 
Fortunately the average school child is protected from the 
dangers of excessive nervous fatigue, because of the diffuse 
nature of his attention, its tendencies to wander in an 
irresponsible way, and the impossibility of securing his 
interest, under normal circumstances, in his work for long 
periods at a time. There are, however, children of a 
somewhat precocious disposition who are capable of sus- 
tained attention for a much longer period, and whose gen- 
eral interest in and enthusiasm for their work offer a 
constant temptation to the teacher to crowd them. They 
are not protected so readily by these natural safeguards 
from overwork; and in many instances they possess a 
somewhat more unstable nervous system than do their legs 
brilliant but more normal schoolmates. For the great 
majority of school children no such danger exists, and the 
_ problem for the teacher is to secure better attention and 
greater interest, so that learning will be under more eco- 
nomical and effective conditions.

attention and the distractions attendant on mental work is

brought back to the central thought by a closely related 
avenue. This is the most potent method of securing at- 
tentive application among the pupils of more advanced 
grades. No ordinary interest in the work at hand is so 
effective as is the proper organization of subject matter. 
Such organization becomes more and more imperative as 
the pupils advance in age and in intelligence.

even under the stimulus of extreme hunger, for among brutes there is an 
entire lack of mental organization.

CHAPTER XIX 
PEDAGOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE DOCTRINE OF 
ATTENTION 
It has already been pointed out in an earlier part of this 
discussion that attention may best be considered from the 
standpoint of adjustment, and that, therefore, 
the motor aspect of it is most important. It plait: a4 
would, therefore, seem that in order to secure tend with- 
the highest degree of attention from the child ae 
he must be required to do something, have Physical 
some positive attitude, in connection with the 
work at hand. This doing, however, does not necessarily 
mean the manipulation of charts, diagrams, and the like, 
although such activities tend to gain and hold the attention. 
Adjustment to the situation very often means simply cor- 
rect attitudes of study. The adjustments in these cases 
are those of the eyes, head, and trunk, very largely. The 
position in which the pupil sits at his desk ts of a great 
deal of tmportance. The hygienic aspect of a proper 
bodily attitude has often been discussed; a correct attitude 
from the standpoint of attention is equally important. The 
child cannot attend unless he has the proper physical attitude. 
It is no matter of small importance to see that he assumes 
this attitude. 
The pupil who rises slowly from his seat, and shuffles to the black- 
board, hanging himself on the chalk trough, is not in the proper attitude, 
as President L. C. Lord of the Charleston Normal School has pointed 
out. He is inattentive, largely because he has not adjusted himself to 
the situation. The remedy for his inattention is to make him rise 
quickly from his seat, walk briskly to the board, and stand in readiness 
to do the work given him.

not the 
accompani- i ag If, for example, children, particularly in the fourth and 
attention. fifth grades of the elementary school, are’ given a series of 
words to commit to memory, they manifest in the learning 
all sorts of bodily contortions and facial grimaces. They wrinkle their 
foreheads, twist their mouths into unusual shapes, strike the fist of one 
hand into the palm of the other, and move about in their seats. This, 
is a manifestation of an inadequate and incomplete adjustment to the 
object of attention, and is probably accompanied by a considerable de- 
gree of emotion. For this reason, it is not the most effective attitude 
for learning. It seems to develop as a habit, at about this time of the 
school life, and although, to inhibit this habit, when it has been once 
formed, may cause a greater distraction to the pupil’s attention than to 
allow him to continue in it, still it is desirable to see that no such habit 
is formed. It seems to be a part of the restlessness and haste which is 
characteristic of a great deal of the work, especially in the lower grades. 
While experiments seem to indicate that children should 
not be compelled to keep perfectly still in their learning, tt 
seems equally desirable that such excess activities as those 
discussed above should be discouraged in the schoolroom. 
One of the most important questions in connection with 
the attention arises’ in discussing the relative value of 
The relative active and of passive attention. As has already 
a been pointed out, passive attention, whether 
of passive fundamental or derived, is less wasteful of time 
attention. and energy than is active attention; therefore, 
more can be accomplished in the stage of passive attention 
than in that of active attention. The goal of education 
would seem to be to turn all active attention into the pas- 
sive type, or, in terms of the Herbartian phraseology, to 
create permanent interests. On the other hand, it is 
equally evident that if it were possible to present all sub- 
jects in the school curriculum in such a manner that the 
pupil were never compelled to give anything but secondary
-P-A-G-E-307
eS be Se ae eee es yee oe S| ee eae 
Pedagogical Applications of A tention 283 
passive attention, such a state of affairs would be serious, 
since the pupil could never accustom himself by this means 
to pay attention to remote rather than immediate ends, if 
in the artificial school environment such a form of attention 
were not necessary. He would find, however, that he 
could not succeed in the life of the world outside, if he 
followed simply the line of least resistance and considered 
only those objects to which his immediate desires prompted 
him to give attention. Only through the direction of ac- 
tive attention is it possible to build up the higher learning 
processes. | 
This consideration brings us at once to the pedagogical 
significance of interest in its relation to attention. The 
emphasis of the doctrine of interest in education 
during the last few decades has worked a pro- peer oa 
found change~in our educational attitudes, and cance of ° ° interest. 
has brought about a revolution in our methods 
of teaching. It has been of incomparable benefit in many 
ways, and has been a most wholesome corrective to the 
dry-as-dust methods of the past. Yet its benefits have 
been accompanied by certain disadvantages and many mis- 
conceptions. The whole doctrine of interest has been 
misunderstood and perverted in many quarters. It has 
given rise to the “soft pedagogy” of recent days, which 
is as disastrous as it is futile and psychologically unsound. 
We have been told that we must interest the child if’'we 
wish to secure his attention, and to this we must assent; 
but to interest him does not mean simply to amuse him, or 
to demand from him in his learning only those things 
which suit his immediate desires. In the first place, it is 
to be remembered that a genuine interest is by no means 
incompatible with serious work, or at least with a deter- 
mined expenditure of energy in overcoming obstacles and 
arriving at ultimate results. When it is necessary, —and it 
often will be in any well conducted school, —the teacher 
should not hesitate to demand the pupil’s attention to

284 The Learning Process 
those parts of the school work that have in them elements 
of drudgery and routine. J/¢ zs more valuable that the child 
should learn the lesson of controlling and directing his atten- 
tion, than that he should master in the easiest manner the 
materials immediately at hand. ‘This does not mean that 
the teacher should go out of his way to make the school 
tasks unnecessarily difficult; they will be hard enough at 
the best; but it does mean that the teacher should never 
get around obstacles that should be overcome by the pupil 
rather than circumvented. 
The boy in school who is encouraged to take the path only that his 
immediate and narrower interests prompt him to take, develops, per- 
haps, in the course of his primary and secondary education, a love for 
manual training, an aptitude for handling tools, and for constructing 
materials. “ How splendid this is,” says the advocate of soft pedagogy ; 
‘“‘ we could never have kept him in school, if he had not had these subjects 
to call forth his interests. It is true that he has done very little with 
his English or his mathematics. He simply did not care for them, and 
it would be a crime to force him into those subjects for which he has 
no interest and which do not appeal to him as being valuable.” Very 
good. Thisseemsaplausibleargument. But the boy has ideals, since he 
is a human being, that lead him beyond the present, and suggest to him 
acareer. To his town return, in the summer, a number of his older friends 
from the neighboring university. They tell him of the possibilities of a 
career as a mechanical engineer, and they arouse hisambitions. When 
he graduates from the high school, he goes to the university, and finds 
much to interest him in the metal and in the wood shops; and he works 
here with an interest so great that he receives high commendation from 
his instructors. But he does not like mathematics, and he has no taste 
for English and foreign languages. He finds out, however, that in order 
to be an engineer he must know a good deal of algebra, trigonometry, and 
calculus ; he must havea smattering of foreign languages (at least theseare 
required, wisely or unwisely, in the course of study which he is pursuing), 
and further, he must be able to write English at least tolerably well, and 
to be familiar with a few of the best books in literature. However, his 
training in soft pedagogy has proved too much forhim. He has learned 
that it is a crime to follow anything but his immediate interests, and so, 
since he cannot take his engineering course without the substantial sub- 
ject of mathematics and the “ frills ” of language and literature, he con- 
cludes it is not worth while, and drops out of the university, going back

  Pedagogical Applications of Attention 285 
to his native town to become an invoice clerk in a local manufactory. 
Here at last he learns the lesson, but too late for him, that in order to 
succeed, one must subordinate one’s present desires to one’s higher 
purposes. 
Connected closely with the fallacious assumptions of 
soft pedagogy in regard to the nature of interest is the be- 
lief among certain educators that the interests cues 
which the pupil has in a subject must be of an jeeg not 
intrinsic nature, z.e. these interests must lie in always be : : . intrinsic. 
the very nature of the subject itself, and not in 
any circumstance that is connected with it. For example, 
if the child is interested in his composition work, it must 
be because of a genuine desire to express his thoughts by 
such a medium; if he is interested in his number work, it 
must be because he recognizes its economic importance. 
Therefore, all the problems in arithmetic must be of the 
sort that appeal to the child from his own sense of com- 
mercial values. His geography lesson, too, must be worked 
out on the same plane, and it must never pass beyond the 
sphere of his immediate interests. This is the way, we are 
told, in which knowledge has developed. There have been 
no luxuries in intelligence. All the subjects of human 
study have arisen because of their practical significance. 
If it had not been for the necessity for measuring land, 
there would have been no geometry; in trade we have to 
count and make change, hence the necessity of arithmetic; 
in communication with others, we are obliged to speak and 
write, hence the development of language. While this 
account of the growth of knowledge is in a sense entirely 
correct, and accords with the pragmatic principles which we 
discussed in an earlier chapter, its pedagogical force is 
modified by two important considerations. In the first 
place it must be remembered that beyond the immediate 
necessities of knowing, the instinct of curiosity has led 
the human mind to push out beyond its most narrow con- 
fines. In this way knowledge has developed beyond im-
-P-A-G-E-310
  286 The Learning Process 
mediate needs. It must also be remembered that this 
process of learning has been a very slow and wasteful one, 
and that since it is the business of education to prepare the 
child for a future environment of which the child has no 
adequate conception, it is necessary to short-circuit this 
racial method of gaining knowledge, and present a large 
body of facts to the child before they are inherently inter- 
esting. So it happens, in the first place, that we can in- 
terest the child in knowing merely for the sake of knowing, 
because the child is curious. We are not obliged to bring 
to his consciousness any social or practical notion whatso- 
ever, in many instances, in order to stimulate him to learn. 
Learning has an interest in itself. It must further be re- 
membered that there are many extrinsic interests that 
attach to the subject matter of the curriculum, 2.e. interests 
that do not belong to the subject matter itself, but rather 
to the conditions that surround it, that may be legitimately 
appealed to in order to promote interest and attention in 
the subject itself. 
One of the strongest incentives to learn that the pupil 
has is the incentive of a natural and healthy rivalry with 
his mates. This is an instinctive interest which 
ann afhel actuates not only children, but adults, to do many 
centive to things that are in themselves incapable of secur- 
jertzine- ing passive attention. Social pressure and the 
desire for social approval have been among the most potent 
factors in giving to the world its treasures of material and 
even spiritual wealth. Those educators who deny the 
value of this social sanction have seen only a very small 
part of the total problem, and have but dimly comprehended 
those forces which have been instrumental in producing 
the civilization of the present day. For this reason school 
grades have a practical justification, and the giving of 
prizes and other marks of distinction a decided pedagogical 
value. Of course, it hardly needs to be added that this 
spirit of emulation should never become so excessive as to
-P-A-G-E-311
  Pedagogical Applications of Aitention 287 
arouse disappointment and bitterness, and produce an at- 
mosphere of unrest in the schoolroom. In this, as in all 
other respects, the golden mean must be followed.! 
It should, however, be kept in mind that whenever it is 
possil'e to link up economically the subject matter with 
some intrinsic interest, it should always be done. fateh 
For example, the teaching of English composi- interests, 
tion can be accomplished by arousing the pupil’s — 
spirit of emulation, or by offering a prize for work superior 
of superior merit, or in other extrinsic ways his in- “ee 
terests may be called forth. There is, however, in general 
a better way of accomplishing this result. 
In a series of investigations carried on by the writer, some years ago, 
in one of the high schools of Worcester, Massachusetts, 2 it was found 
that the compositions in which the pupils were encouraged to express 
_ those ideas that were interesting and vital to them showed a higher de- 
gree of merit, both in inventive ability and in form, than did those com- 
positions that were turned out in the course of the ordinary “ grind.” 
It would be difficult, however, to explain to the average 
pupil the value of learning the multiplication table except 
as a part of the ordinary schooltasks. Its immediate prac- 
tical advantage might be pointed out, but this would be of 
little significance to him. In seeking to develop subjects 
according to their intrinsic interests a good deal has been 
accomplished, and the attempt to further develop such in- 
terests should be encouraged up to the point where they do 
not waste a large amount of valuable time, and. lead, as such 
attempts sometimes do, to all sorts of far-fetched and some- 
times ridiculous excursions into “‘ experimental” pedagogy. 
In discussing the topic of interest, it should further be, 
kept in mind that a subject, not originally interesting, may 
become so, after it has been comprehended and mastered. 
This acquired interest is due in part to the fact that the at-

tention is held to the subject matter until the attitude becomes 
habitual, and, therefore, at least not unpleasant. But the 
Subjects principal cause of the development of interest 
not origi- in such cases is due to the fact that the subject nally inter- . ; 4 ec 
esting may gradually acquires a meaning and significance. 
become so. This significance appears because the various 
parts of the material learned have become associated in 
such a way that the relation between these parts is com- 
prehended, and because the suggestion of one topic brings 
also to mind many others. When the pupil discovers that 
there is ‘‘something in the subject,” he acquires a liking for 
it, especially in the work of the higher grades and in the 
high school. Theteacher should never fear when there is a 
lack of interest at the start, if he feels capable of bringing 
to the minds of his pupils, as the course develops, the mean- 
ing of what they are studying. This is particularly true of 
such subjects as history and nature study, in which causal 
connections can be traced out and results definitely shown. 
The mistake is often made of supposing that interest is 
always positive, z.e. that we act in the direction only of the 
Storeat promptings of pleasure and desire. Interest 
fie may equally well be negative. The motive 
aswellas force which impels us to action may be the 
Positive. desire to escape punishment as well as to gain 
areward. In experiments in animal psychology, the fact 
that painful stimuli are more potent in securing and hold- 
ing attention than are pleasurable stimuli is significant. 
On the lower levels of learning this is the principal motive 
of conduct. On the higher levels, it plays-a less important, 
but not an insignificant réle. The question of punishment 
in the school is as important as that of reward.! 
Soft pedagogy has interpreted the doctrine of interest 
in a manner which has led to serious theoretical and 
practical consequences; it has likewise made an error in 
its interpretation of the significance of effort. Work de-

mands that obstacles shall be overcome. The work of the 
schoolroom is no exception to this rule. The fact that 
attention cannot attain its highest degree of Soft peda- 
efficiency without distraction is tremendously gogy has 
significant in the entire realm of education, and aled ws 
indeed in the whole course of racial develop- significance 
_Jnent. A certain amount of hardness in the en- or 
/ vironmental conditions produces better results in the long 
reaches of evolution than does an environment entirely fa- 
vorable. So it is throughout human life. Jf the teacher 
could remove every difficulty in the schoolroom, he would 
have gone too far, and would have failed of the end that he 
is striving to reach. The easy chair has no place in the 
study. 
To secure the best attention in the schoolroom, the 
teacher must give careful consideration to the sequence 
of the various parts of the program of study, _ . 
and must also intersperse judiciously periods ee 
of rest and recreation. As we have. already test should : ° ‘ \ alternate. 
said, the problem of fatigue includes, from the 
practical point of view, not merely fatigue as such, but 
the loss of interest as well. We must not continue any 
subject so long that it becomes a bore. When we remem- 
ber that the average adult of ordinary intelligence finds 
a discourse extending over an hour too long, unless it 
be of unusual merit, we may readily see that little children 
will soon become tired of a subject that continues through 
a period of considerable length. In the lower grades, 
there should be many changes in the program. Probably 
not more than twenty minutes should be spent on any 
topic, unless in the course of its’ development different 
phases of this topic are emphasized. Likewise the periods 
of rest should be much more numerous. There should 
not be the same.recess for the whole school. The small 
children should have several recesses, or breaks of some 
sort, during each session. There should be periods of

rest, and others of free play, but little of regular gymnastic 
work or physical exercise, unless this latter is given for 
its own sake, and not for the sake of relief from the 
tedium of the school day. Since most children do their 
best work during the morning hours, the more difficult 
subjects should find a place in this part of the day, unless 
they are divided into two periods daily, in which case, as 
previously stated, one period may be advantageously 
placed in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Less 
is accomplished in the afternoon session than in the 
morning session. Indeed, the afternoon session, partic- 
ularly in the winter, is in many instances too long. It 
might be better to limit the afternoon period to an hour 
and a half, even if in so doing we were obliged to cut 
out some of those subjects that enrich the curriculum, 
but at the expense of time and energy that could be 
applied in other directions with benefit to the child. 
The fact that pleasant work lessens fatigue may seem 
again to show the necessity of .a soft pedagogy. However, 
Gand there are two sides to this question. It is highly 
essential to desirable, on the one hand, that the schoolroom 
school work. hould be bright and cheerful, that the teacher 
should be mild and not irritable, and that the pupils should 
be free from nervousness and haste. Grinding tasks should 
not be imposed when not necessary. It is clear that the 
most effective work, whether physical or mental, can be 
accomplished only when the body and the mind are on a 
high level of living. Yet, on the other hand, just as the 
unpleasant is necessary in life outside the school in order 
that greater pleasure shall finally result, so in the school- 
room there must always be tasks that are irksome. If 
there is to be a sound and permanent foundation for knowl- 
edge, there must be drill, and even a certain amount of 
grind, throughout the entire process of learning. It would 
be fortunate if the drill and the grind could be conducted 
under the stimulus of interest, and its accompanying pleas:
-P-A-G-E-315
Pedagogical Applications ' of Attention 291 
  ure, but it is better that the school tasks should be per- 
formed with a certain modicum of unpleasantness, rather 
than that they should not be performed at all. If the 
work is important, it must be undertaken. 
The fact that attention fluctuates, not only within brief 
periods, but within longer ones as well, has considerable 
educational significance. Ordinarily, in taking es | 
up an intellectual task, both the child and the must jearn 
adult approach it with a degree of reluctance. _ an 
It is like taking a cold shower bath. When we 
are fairly in the midst of our subject, however, we forget 
the external interests that at first made it difficult for us to 
do our work, and which led us to accept any excuse, never 
mind how trivial, in order to postpone the task. Success 
in holding the attention upon the problem at hand will de- : 
pend upon how thoroughly we get into the second phase 
of our work. Many children, and far too many adults, do 
not succeed in passing beyond this first phase of attention, 
in which it fluctuates between external interests and the 
work at hand. These “fool away” their time, and often 
wonder why it is that the study hour brings such slight 
results. For the mature student the solution of this 
difficulty consists in habituating himself to begin work 
immediately, to plunge into his subject without unneces- 
sary preliminary preparation. For the teacher, the solu- 
tion lies in forming in the pupil habits that shall lead to 
rapid adaptation of attention. The second phase of atten- 
tion in long-continued work is followed by a third stage, 
which in time tends to make its appearance. This third 
phase is due, in part, to the fact that those physical adjust- 
ments that are made in order to keep the attention at its 
maximum gradually appear in consciousness as sensations 
of strain and muscular fatigue. 
It is true, also, that we often form the bad habit of 
thinking that after a certain lapse of time we should quit 
work. This habit often causes us to stop when there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
292 | The Learning Process 
  slight necessity for so doing. This is a serious loss when 
our thought processes are running smoothly, and our at- 
tention is so well ddapted that we have reached 
soe deeeagarg the maximum of efficiency. How quickly we 
the learner Jet up when we think of the approaching vacation 
importan'- that is close at hand! We conclude that we are 
tired and need a rest, when our physical and mental con- 
dition does not demand it. If the vacation were a month, 
rather than a week away, it would never-occur to us that 
we were fatigued. So it is in setting limits to our periods 
of mental work during the day. If we conclude that two 
hours is a sufficiently lengthy period for intellectual labor, 
as the end of this time approaches we are certain to feel 
the necessity of rest and recreation. If the period were 
four hours instead of two, this feeling of the need for 
rest.would not appear until the end of the four-hour period. 
So the problem for the adult becomes one of a proper men- 
tal attitude toward his work that leads to the establishment 
of systematic habits. From the child in the school no such 
lengthy periods of work can be expected, and the third 
stage of bodily distraction does not become so important as 
it does for the adult. However, the various recesses and 
rest periods that are dispersed throughout the school pro- 
gram should be devised to remove, as far as possible, these 
elements of distraction from the consciousness of the child. 
When those periods of the school day are reached at 
which naturally fatigue and lack of interest set in, the 
a subjects of the program should be of such a 
program in Character that they require as little of the higher 
reference to thought processes as possible. The more me- fatigue. i i . 
chanical learning can be better accomplished at 
such times, than can the higher forms that depend upon 
the intelligent forming of associations. It is easier to learn 
a multiplication table, or the spelling of a list of words, in 
such periods, than it is to solve a problem in arithmetic or 
to reason out a fact in natural science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  Pedagogical Applications of Attention 203 
When we come to the higher intellectual processes, atten- 
tion appears to be even more necessary than it does in the 
lower and more mechanical forms, although it diciailies 
cannot be dispensed with at any level of learn- adjusted 
ing. Mere repetition is of little avail to the iouueaeey 
pupil, unless he gives a reasonable amount of for higher 
attention. In rational thought the direction of “°U#* 
attention is essential in determining the kinds of associa- 
tions that are formed. If we are interested in a certain 
aspect of a situation, we tend to pay attention to that aspect, 
and we soon find our associations grouping themselves to- 
gether in a very definite way in the direction of our atten- 
tion. The nature of reasoning, as we shall see in the 
following chapters, is very largely a matter of selective 
attention. Zhe person who reasons well ts the one who ts 
able to choose the proper aspect of the situation to which he ts 
giving his attention, and who is further able to hold his 
attention to the point at issue. The person who is not able 
to hold to the principal point in an argument is scatter- 
brained and ineffectual in his reasoning. 
Will, in the last analysis, is a matter of attention. The 
education of a right will consists in training those aspects 
of attention that have regard for situations that wy i. 
are stamped with social approval. Exclusive fundamen- ‘ . ° : tally a mat- 
thought in a certain direction tends to lead to ter of 
activity in that direction. It seems to be a fact &ttention. 
without exception that a given idea will always lead to a 
response in the direction of the object which this idea calls 
up, unless it is inhibited by another idea which more power- 
fully claims the attention. This circumstance is tremen- 
dously significant in) moral education. It cannot be ade- 
quately discussed within the limits of the present chapter, 
but in passing it may be said that it is a doubtful educa- 
tional policy to refer in the schoolroom to undesirable acts, 
unless there is an immediate and pressing necessity for so 
doing. Negative suggestion is as potent as positive sug:

  gestion in many cases. It further should be kept in mind 
that a well balanced will consists primarily in the ability 
to attend adequately to various aspects of a situation. 
Overemphasis of any one aspect tends to result in too 
hasty a decision, while overdeliberation results in indeci- 
sion.

  CHAPTER XX 
THE HIGHER THOUGHT PROCESSES — LOGICAL THINKING 
THE term “thought” is used in popular language in a 
loose and indefinite sense. We sometimes employ the 
expression “thinking of nothing,” while, on the wae ial 
other hand, we assert that “ we must think, if we “thought” 
wish to solve a difficulty or arrive ataconclusion.” pee 
Manifestly, these two expressions are used in Senses. 
widely divergent senses, and yet they have an element in 
common. When I say that I am merely thinking, or think- 
ing about nothing, I have in mind a state of consciousness 
that is well exemplified by what is termed day-dreaming. 
In such a condition of mind as this, conscious state suc- 
ceeds conscious state with apparently very little connection, 
and with no active determination on my part. When, on 
the other hand, I am thinking in the sense of giving my 
attention to the solution of a problem, my thought processes 
are flowing on, but in a more orderly fashion. There is 
less passivity and more active direction of the thought. 
Yet, both the vaguest states of day-dreaming and the most 
sharply defined and logical thought processes have certain 
fundamental elements in common. 
In thinking, whether it be rational or haphazard, there 
is always an onflowing of consciousness. There is a pro- 
cess which is more or less definitely moving to- Thinking 
ward some end, and which contains more than involves an 
the sensory datum. In other words, there must _ , 
invariably be an ideational element. The mere sciousness. 
succession of sensations in consciousness would not consti- 
tute thought. On the other hand, when consciousness goes 
beyond mere sensation, and deals in images, their succes 
295

  296 The Learning Process — r 
sive appearance, in a more or less orderly manner, consti- 
tutes a thought process. Further, thinking involves not 
only the onflowing of consciousness, but the onflowing in 
some direction, either definitely recognized or vaguely felt. 
When I am building castles in Spain, my imagination is 
not developing in an absolutely arbitrary fashion; the 
images are controlled by my general intellectual attitude, 
or by the emotional tone of my consciousness. The prod- 
ucts of my fancy may grow with an astonishing rapidity, 
but they grow in some order. I may have in mind the 
thought of acquiring great wealth, and with this thought 
in my consciousness as an end, the various images of my 
fancy arise and group themselves in terms of this thought. 
Perhaps I fit out an expedition to go to some distant land in search 
of treasure; in which case I picture to myself a band of hardy adven- 
turers, a ship sailing in remote waters; islands with tropical foliage, low 
lying on thedistant horizon; the glistening sands of an unknown shore ; 
strange adventures and hairbreadth escapes in entangled forests, or 
cavernous chambers within the earth; achart with strange characters, 
which in the camp at night, under the flare of an ill-smelling torch, is de- 
ciphered ; the sound of pickaxe and shovel as the adventurers work, 
digging near the roots of a gigantic tree ip the weird light of the moon ; 
the discovery of the long-hidden chest, with its curious carvings; the 
breaking of the rusty lock; the glitter of the gold and silver, and the 
shouts of joy of the exultant company. All these images flit across my 
mind as I lie in the grass with eyes half closed, dreamily conscious of 
the white clouds as they move across the blue summer’s sky. 
There is surely in such a process of thought as this little 
that resembles logical reasoning at first glance; and yet, 
from the standpoint of the thought processes themselves and 
the laws which dominate them, the resemblances are far 
greater than the differences. Both in day-dreaming and 
in logical thinking, the succession of ideational elements 
is determined by some conscious idea and a feeling or 
emotional background. When I dream of adventure, I 
have in some way before my consciousness the idea of its 
outcome, and if my mood be happy, the images that sug: 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
    The Higher Thought Processes — Logical Thinking 297 
  gest themselves will fit into that mood. When, on the other 
hand, I am attempting to convince my opponent, or to 
gain the assent of my audience in a political debate, the 
succession of my ideas is again determined by the end I 
have in view, by the purpose which I set before me, and 
by the desire which I have to establish one proposition and 
to overthrow another. In logical thinking, as well as in 
mere castle building, my feeling attitudes, as well as the in- 
tellectual end of my thinking, exercise a selective influence 
in the choice and arrangement of my ideas. So in the 
end, rational thinking and day-dreaming are made on the 
same loom, and though the patterns and colors of the fab- 
ric may differ, the strands bear a striking resemblance, 
and both the garment of fancy and the garment of rational 
thinking are woven by an identical process. 
Rational thought, then, differs chiefly from non-rational 
thought in that the former is a subjectively controlled 
process. Here the end in view is definitely ) ona 
defined, the goal in which the thought process thought a 
terminates is sharply outlined, and this end, this Svar une 
goal, must be kept in consciousness through trolled 
sustained attention. We have already referred °°°* 
in our earlier discussions to the necessity of keeping this 
end in view as a problem to be solved, as an adjustment to 
be accomplished. The direction which the thought takes 
depends absolutely upon the nature of the problem and 
upon the consistency with which it is held in mind. The 
problem, which is always present in any complicated thought 
process, appears on the subjective side as a thought crisis of 
greater or less intensity, and on the objective side as a 
reaction which goes beyond habit. This fact we have al- 
ready noticed in our chapter on Habit. 
Logical reasoning further involves symbols, which repre- 
sent concrete realities and function as meanings. Meanings 
are of two sorts, sensorial and ideational. In any sensory 
experience, the more commonly recognized sense impres-
-P-A-G-E-322
  298 The Learning Process } 
sions are but a part of the total situation. These sensory 
experiences are the focal elements in consciousness, which 
stand for, or represent, the significance of the Logical 
thought entire situation. For example, the tree which 
involves § [ see before me brings to me a certain visual symbols. 
impression of color and form. This visual 
impression, however, represents vastly more than it directly 
reveals. It carries an attitude, which is in the fringe of 
consciousness, and in the last analysis signifies my adjust- 
ments to the tree. Perhaps it is a tree that I knew when 
a boy, and its meaning comes to me largely in terms of 
climbing it and swinging from its branches, or reaching up 
and picking the fruit that grows from its limbs. These ad- 
justments are not in the focus of my consciousness, but in 
the margin, while the focal element, the visual sensation, 
represents, or stands for, these various adjustments. 
We can find countless examples of the fact that the 
meaning of a concrete object of sensation is, in the last 
SE analysis, focally represented by a _ sensation 
completed OF an image and completed by the fringe or 
—" halo, constituted by images or sensations of 
adjustments that we tend to make or actually 
do make in the presence of the object. A// meaning, then, 
is completed in motor terms. This fact is clearly brought 
out by the definitions which young children give to objects. 
An object for the child is invariably that which does some- 
thing, or with which something is done. ‘“ Mother is to 
kiss”; “Candy is to eat’; “ Horse is to ride”; and so 
on. As thought progresses in complexity, we find the 
concrete object which constitutes the core around which 
the meanings center, replaced by ideational elements and 
symbols, largely verbal in their nature. Words now carry 
the meanings of the concrete situations for which they 
stand. The element in the focus of consciousness is 
no longer the tree itself, but the word ‘tree”’ spoken, or 
printed. or heard; but in any case there goes with this 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
The Higher Thought Processes — Logical Thinking 299 
symbol of the external object the fringe of adjustment 
which the idea calls forth and which appears in conscious- 
ness as an attitude! In the case of the concrete object, 
these kinzsthetic fringes may be, as we have already 
said, due to actual adjustments. We may, on seeing the 
tree, complete its meaning by actually climbing it and 
swinging from its branches, or we may reach up and pick 
its fruit. Here the meaning has been finally worked out. 
Before the actual tree, however, we may stand and com- 
prehend its meaning, either through incipient kinesthetic 
sensations, or through images of those sensations. In the 
first place, we may actually start toward the tree as if to 
climb it, or we may innervate the muscles of our arms, as 
if to raise them and pick the fruit. When we do not have 
the concrete, but the merely verbal image of the tree 
before us, we cannot make acomplete and final adjustment 
to the object of our thought; but we can climb the tree in 
imagination, or we can have incipient images which stand 
for experiences of climbing. In this latter case, the mean- 
ing as such is always a matter of the fringe, while in the 
case when the meaning is actually completed, either in 
reality or in imagination, it may enter the focus of our 
consciousness, and become the predominating element in 
it. On the other hand, generally the meaning of a situation 
is not carried out to its ultimate completion, or, if it is so 
carried out, it is expressed by reactions largely habitual, 
and hence not directed by consciousness. Thus generally 
the concrete or the verbal representatives of the meaning 
occupy the center of consciousness. 
This doctrine that meaning is a matter of the fringe was 
first definitely stated by James. He says, ‘“‘ The mean- 
ing is a function of the more ‘transitive’ parts of con- 
1 fn this discussion, the term “ attitude” is used to signify the subjective 
aspect of adjustment or behavior. The attitude is as mental content kinzs- 
thetic sensation or image.

sciousness, the ‘fringe’ of relation which we feel surround: 
ing the image, be the latter sharp or dim.” Bagley? has 
further developed this thought of meaning 'residing in the 
fringe of consciousness, as follows: “The kinesthetic 
elements are predominantly marginal elements, and the 
marginal elements ‘carry the meaning.’” 
This view of meaning is thoroughly in accord with the 
standpoint we have taken throughout our discussion, 
namely, that az object in the last analysis means

kinesthetic attitudes accompanying the adjustment itself 
images or = under ordinary circumstances are not that which sensations. . . 4 aS 
is in the focus of our attention; it is rather the 
object as something seen, or heard, or touched to which 
we give attention. The moment that we shift our atten- 
tion to the motor side of the situation, the adjustment itself 
- tends to become imperfect and unsatisfactory. Here we 
are going back to our earlier principle of habit. Whena 
situation has become entirely mastered, z.e. when it has 
fully acquired meaning, so that nothing new needs to be 
known about it, then, all the adjustments that constitute 
that meaning have become facile and automatic. It is 
further to be remembered that when the adjustment is so 
completed, when the thought crises have entirely disap- 
peared, the meaning, carried in the fringe, becomes less 
and less a matter of consciousness, and finally tends to dis- 
appear. The whole world acquires significance as adjust- 
ments become more and more perfected; but the focal 
character of this significance at the same time gradually 
fades out. Under these conditions we do not need to con- 
sider these adjustments as such; but sensations and images, 
both concrete and verbal, of the objects, stand for these 
tendencies to reaction, and, therefore, are representative.

However, there remain, as an indefinite and scarcely dis- 
cernible nimbus attached to these symbols, the vestiges of 
former adjustments in the nature of those kinesthetic 
images that we discussed in the section on mimetic 
imagery.!. Here we said that, having once assumed that 
the meaning of a situation is after all an attitude, and that 
an attitude must be in the last analysis a motor affair, it is 
but a step to the conclusion that this general dependence 
of experience for its significance on motor adjustments 
has left a deposit that stands for concrete situations, not 
actually present, but ideally represented. We further con- 
cluded that this fringe of kinesthetic imagery, this at- 
titude, has escaped the introspective analyses of those 
investigators who have inferred from their experiments 
in reasoning and judging that there is such a mental 
state as imageless thought ;? in other words, that thought 
1 See Chapter VII, pp. 109-112. 
2 Among writers in English who have maintained the existence of image- 
less thought are Stout, who holds that there are modes of consciousness 
“not composed of visual, auditory, tactual, or other experiences derived from 
them” (“ Analytic Psychology,” I, pp. 78-96, 1896), and Woodworth, who 
does not believe that “images plus sensations exhaust the content of a 
thought” ( Jour. of Phil., Psychol., and Scientific Methods, Ill, pp. 701-708, 
1906). Binet, Biihler, Watt, Messer, Mayer and Orth, Ach and Marbe, 
among foreign investigators, are in substantial agreement with this position. 
Mayer and Orth in their investigations (Zezts. f. Psychol. u. Physiol. d. 
Sinnesorgane, XXVI, 1901) found, in addition to the ordinarily recognized 
thought elements, a Bewzsstseinslage, or conscious attitude, and most of the 
other writers have detected a similar element. Marbe (xperimentell-

various varieties of Bewusstseinslagen. Itis fair to assume that this conscious 
attitude has an actual sensory basis, and is, indeed, as far as it is conscious 
at all, in part at least, constituted by the vestiges of former adjustments that 
have become dim and marginal, but which still have a reality and an imaginal 
character. Titchener, who gives a most comprehensive review and analysis 
of this whole literature in his “ Experimental Psychology of the Thought 
Processes ” (New York, 1909), concludes that meanings may be carried without 
consciousness at all, and hence may be purely physiological. When the 
conscious attitude actually is present, it may be carried in various ways; 
but, in part at least, the writer believes, by kinzesthetic sensations or kinzes

is capable of proceeding without any “ mind-stuff’’ what: 
soeyer, and that there are tendencies and relations in the 
human mind that have no observable existence in the sensory 
content itself. 
Rational thought involves conception. The conceptual 
attitude is generally distinguished from the perceptual, and 
Rational the concept from the percept. The percept is

while the concept is considered as an abstract or general 
idea, —as chair, table, friend, existing at no definite time 
and in no particular place. According to this point of 
view, I may have a clear percept of a particular chair that 
is to be found in a particular room, in a certain definite 
position ; on the other hand, if I have a concept of a chair, 
I have no such definite object in mind. In the latter case, 
my mental state represents a chair of any size, color, or 
shape, existing in any position in space whatsoever, and 
without reference to any particular time. 
The above statement of the difference between percept 
and concept, while relatively simple, is, however, inadequate, 
and in a measure, incorrect. The identification Is the con- ‘ ; . ; ceptagen- Of the concept with the general idea likewise

out and clearly formulated by Berkeley,» who denied 
that it was possible to have in consciousness a general idea 
that represented nothing in particular, but stood for certain 
identical features common to a class of objects. How is it 
possible, the query goes, to have an idea of a chair which

Imagery,” combats the view of imageless thought; and recently Book, writing 
‘On the Genesis and Development of Conscious Attitudes” (Psychol. Rev., 
XVII, pp. 381-398, 1910), shows in an interesting way how the processes of 
adjustment in typewriter reactions become more and more vague as the 
adjustments become more adequate and habitual.

refers to a chair with no particular color or shape or size? 
Whenever the idea of an object comes up, it must come in 
some definite form, and with concrete qualities. Berkeley 
seems to have been right in denying the possibility of the 
existence of a general idea in the sense in which he used 
the term. When we think of ‘‘horse”’ in general, are we 
not obliged to recall in imagination some particular horse 
with which we are familiar, or which we construct from our 
experiences with various horses, or to recall in rapid succes- 
sion numbers of particular horses? When, for example, I 
think of triangle, there come to my mind in rapid succes- 
sion images of different triangles, — isosceles, equilateral, 
right angle, large and small, indistinctly following each 
other. I do not, however, experience in imagination a 
“general” triangle. If the conceptual experience means 
the experience of a general idea in the above sense. of the 
word, such an experience is problematical, to say the least.1 
The difficulty regarding the nature of conceptual thought 
lies in the attempt to interpret the concept structurally 
rather than functionally. Structurally we are pe con- 
perhaps warranted in assuming that there is no ceptual . : . attitude a 
general idea. We always find on introspection generalized

for such images. However, a functional interpretation 
removes the difficulty involved in the structural viewpoint. 
Whatever the mental content with respect to the conceptual 
attitude may be, —and doubtless the content varies from time 
to time, — the attitude itself may be termed a generalized 
attitude, ze. an attitude that applies to many different 
and particular objects. Zhe conceptual attitude arises in 
1 Watt, in an investigation conducted some years ago (“ Experimentelle Bei- 
trage zu einer Theorie des Denkens,” Archiv f. d. gesamte Psychol., IV, pp. 289=" 
436, 1905), found that some of his subjects reported an extreme vagueness in 
the mental imagery connected with abstract attitudes of thought. The report of 
these subjects, however, indicates indistinctness rather than lack of concrete- 
ness in such states of consciousness. It is not to be assumed that lack of 
clearness is identical with a general idea.

the process of adjustment, and in essence tt signifies that the 
object now present to the senses or to thetmagination ts to be 
reacted to in a certain typical manner. Ina sense, this is 
likewise true of the perceptual attitude as well. When, on 
revisiting my boyhood home, I recognize a particular tree, 
this object of sensory experience calls up a definite attitude 
_that is in reality the meaning that this tree possesses for me, 
a meaning due to previous adjustments that I have made 
to the tree; for example, the climbing or the fruit-picking 
attitude. When I think of “tree” in general, however, the 
meaning is found in some one specific adjustment, or several 
such adjustments, that I tend to make in the presence of 
all trees, irrespective of their individual differences. This 
means in terms of consciousness that among various and 
dissimilar attitudes that I have in relation to various and 
dissimilar trees there is at least one specific attitude that 
remains constant in this diversity. If all the attitudes that 
I have in my various experiences with trees are practically 
identical, I have a perceptual attitude; if, on the other 
hand, there are marked differences in certain attitudes, 
with identity or similarity in one or a few, then I have the 
conceptual attitude. Objectively considered (z.e. from the 
standpoint of adjustment or behavior), the concept appears 
as an adjustment to various objects in terms of some par- 
ticular aspect or aspects that these objects have in common, 
as indicated by an identity of adjustment in certain particu- 
lars. Subjectively considered, however, the conceptual 
attitude arises only when, among various tendencies toward 
adjustment, one at least is selected as adequate in terms of 
past adjustments. In other words, a reaction in a typical 
way is not conceptual if there are not accompanying ten- 
dencies to react in various other ways. Jz so far as these 
various attitudes are tdentical, the state of mind ts perceptual; 
in so far, however, as they differ in certain particulars, while 
being identical or similar in others, these attitudes are con- 
ceptual,

An example may make this point clearer. I am visited by an old 
acquaintance, toward whom I have definite attitudes, which because of 
their practically habitual character, may be termed “‘ perceptual.” This 
means that I do certain definite things in his presence, treat him in — ; 
certain specific ways, behave in a customary manner. I tell him my 
private affairs, invite him to a game of cards, suggest a walk, or a visit 
to the theater, and so on. In these respects I am reacting to him 
entirely as an individual, consulting his particular tastes and doing 
those things that I have learned through experience will accord with 
his wishes, — and in all this I am acting with little thought. Since I 
know his personality so well, the meaning for me of his personality 
will express itself in relatively habitual attitudes toward him, and thus 
this meaning is not clearly present, but is in the fringe of con- 
sciousness. Suppose, however, I observe in this friend, for the first 
time, some hitherto unknown trait. I discuss politics, for example, and 
to my surprise I arouse his resentment. I can no longer treat him 
entirely on the habitual plane; I must readjust my attitude toward him, 
and to do this I must treat him in general terms, namely, as an individ- 
ual who exhibits anger. I must bring to bear on this new situation 
general experiences with angry persons. I have thus, for the time 
being, passed from the perceptual to the conceptual attitude, and have 
left the level of habitual responses for that of focalized meanings. My 
friend, in a sense, when angry means more in terms of clear conscious- 
ness than he did before. 
It may be seen from the above example that in all our 
thinking the perceptual and conceptual attitudes are inter- 
woven. When our reactions are relatively Un- perceptual 
varying, we are treating the objects of these re- and con- 
actions from the perceptual standpoint; when, oe eae 
however, there is considerable variability in ‘terwoven. 
reaction, when thought crises arise and meanings be- 
come explicit, and symbolized in some focal element of con-— 
sciousness (as, for example, the flush on the cheek of my 
Jriend, tndicating or meaning anger), then, we have the 
conceptual attitude. However, in the last analysis the 
difference between the percept and concept is a matter of 
degree rather than of kind. Except in completely habitual 
responses, where consciousness is reduced to the vanishing 
point, there is a modicum of generalized attitude in the

response, even toward individual situations, that is to say, 
every percept is in a sense a concept, and conversely every 
generalized situation has in it some elements identical with 
previous situations that have called forth in some par- 
ticulars similar attitudes of response. To this extent 
every concept has in it an element of perception. The 
focal content that symbolizes the conceptual attitude may 
be some definite object of sense; it may be the image of 
such an object, either concrete or verbal; it may be a 
series of such images; this is not a material matter. It 
is the attitude found in the fringe, representing a uni- 
form type of reaction under varying conditions, that makes 
the concept and gives it a general character. 
Binet? has expressed practically the same point of view in his statement 
that an image may represent a particular or a general meaning. It de- 
pends upon what the subject zztends as to whether the mental content 
is to be considered as perceptual or conceptual. Dewey? states even 
more clearly this fact, as follows: ‘Conceptions are general because 
of their use and application, not because of their ingredients. ... 
Generality resides in application to the comprehension of new cases, not 
in constituent parts. A collection of traits left as the common residuum, 
the caput mortuum of a million objects, would be merely a collection, 
an inventory or aggregate, not a general idea; a striking trait em- 
phasized in any one experience which then served to help understand 
some one other experience would become, in virtue of that service of 
application, in so far general. Synthesis is not a matter of mechanical 
addition, but of application of something discovered in one case to 
bring other cases into line.” 
The assumption, then, generally made by logicians that 
our concepts are arrived at bya process of observing 
Concepts particulars and by emphasizing in these elements 
not arrived of identity or similarity, and by ignoring elements at by a pure ‘ . 
processof that are unlike, seems untenable from the stand- 
abstraction. point of psychology. Even if we should hold 
to the belief, as did Huxley,’ that there is such an entity as

a generalized idea, which exists in consciousness as a sort 
of a composite photograph of all the particulars which it 
represents, we still would not be justified in regarding the 
conceptual process as essentially a comparison of identical 
elements in various individuals of a group. If we ask 
ourselves what are the marks to be found in a general idea 
that are shared by the individuals that come under it, we 
will not find any specific marks. Ouridea of a table in the 
sense of a general notion, is a table without any particular 
color, shape, or size. The table may be made of any ma- 
terial whatsoever, and may be found in any part of the wide 
universe and in any imaginable time. The marks which 
the “ general” table possesses, in common with particular 
tables, thus vanish on analysis. The only similarity be- 
tween all the tables which make them alike for the purposes 
of thought, ts the similarity of human reaction to them. 
We may form a general notion of the uses of a table from 
our experience with one table, and apply this conception of 
tables to all future objects toward which we can react in a 
similar manner 
The study of consciousness from its genetic standpoint 
shows us, likewise, that the notion that a concept is de- 
rived from a large number of particular percepts is unten- 
1The assumption that the essence of abstraction is of the extremely formal 
nature held to by the logicians, has entered the field of psychology and found 
its place in the experimental literature. In a monograph recently written by 
Moore on the “ Process of Abstraction” (University of California Publi- 
cations in Psychology, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 79-197, November, 1910), which con- 
tains much that is excellent, the fundamental assumption made in devising and 
carrying out the experiment is that concepts are formed in just this artificial 
way. The results, therefore, are doubtful to the extent to which the assump- 
tion is unwarranted. The experimenter states that the investigations were 
commenced in Wundt’s laboratory and that Wundt himself gave valuable sug- 
gestions as to the method of the experiment. Thorndike of Columbia is also 
mentioned by the writer as having given the original stimulus to his investi- 
gations. These facts are mentioned to indicate how widespread, and with 
what eminent authority, this theory of abstraction which; may be regarded as 
false as it is unfortunate, finds support among psychologists,

able. The behavior of most of the higher animals shows 
us very clearly that they have generalized types of reac- 
tion toward class objects. The dog reacts to A concept 5s 6 : . . not neces- bones of all descriptions in a certain typical 
sarily de- . rived from W2Y- it is true that we cannot assume that the 
anumber of animal has a definite concept, that is, a felt atti- 
ae > tude, as an element of consciousness; but his ex- 
perience functions in this general way, and for all practical 
purposes he has incipient conception of a bone. We find 
the little child at one stage of development treating all 
male adults as his father. The child makes no distinction 
whatever between various individuals, but they all function 
for one general kind of reaction. So too at another stage 
of the child’s development, all strangers arouse the gen- 
eralized fear reaction. Probably in the brute to a slight 
extent, and certainly in the child to a much greater extent, 
there comes a period in which these most general attitudes 
are broken up through experiences into reactions of a more 
circumscribed type. The child, for example, after a time, 
no longer treats all men as his father, nor does he fear all 
strangers. This is because his attitudes then become more 
specific, and within the larger group there arise smaller 
groups. Dewey! has expressed the general manner in 
which such concepts are formed, as follows: “‘ Not through 
the senses, but by means of the reaction, the responsive 
adjustment, is the impression made distinctive, and given 
a character marked off from other qualities that call out 
unlike reactions.” 
The above point of view does not mean that education is in error in 
~ assuming that in order to have clear concepts, there must be wide 
experience and careful discrimination between the various parts of 
experience ; but it does emphasize the fact that the essence of concep- 
tion is in reaction and in the conscious attitudes accompanying reaction, 
rather than in logical comparison and discrimination. If the child is 
to be taught the nature of a river system, he must, if possible, be shown 
a river; he must at least see pictures and maps of rivers, he must con-

struct, through clay models and otherwise, beds of rivers, river banks, 
watersheds, and so on. In these various experiences the child will 
have arrived at certain characteristics that are essential in his reaction 
to a river. Nevertheless, the child could have had a generalized atti- 
tude if he had had an experience with only one river. Doubtless, the 
boy who takes up the study of geography after he has acquired a wide 
experience with the particular river that flows through his town, and 
thus extends his experience by this study, gets a more correct notion 
of rivers in general than he had when he was acquainted with the 
single river in his locality. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to assume 
that his experience with one river had not established in his mind a 
certain type-reaction which could function in regard to rivers that he 
might meet in other places than his own native town. 
Dewey?’ expresses the above thought as follows, in discussing the 
manner in which the concept of dog is formed by the child: “As a 
matter of fact, the child begins with whatever significance he has got out 
of the one dog he has seen, heard, and handled. He has found that he 
can carry over from one experience of this object to subsequent ex- 
veriences certain expectations of certain characteristic modes of behavior 
—may expect these even before they show themselves, . . . but 
finding that other expected traits and modes of behavior are not fulfilled, 
he is forced to throw out certain traits from the dog-meaning, while by 
contrast certain other traits are selected and emphasized. ... He 
has not begun with a lot of ready-made objects from which he extracts 
a common meaning; he tries to apply to every new experience whatever, 
from his old experience, will help him to understand it, and as this 
process of constant assumption and experimentation is fulfilled and 
refined by results, his conceptions get body and clearness.”

  CHAPTER XxXI 
THE THOUGHT PROCESS IN JUDGMENT AND 
REASONING 
THE nature of the judgment does not differ essentially 
from that of the concept, except that the judgment exists 
in a more expanded form and is more clearly 
ae conscious. A judgment on the subjective side 
expanded represents a definite problem that is brought to 
2 amram the attention of consciousness and solved; on 
the objective side it involves the possibility of a positive or 
a negative reaction, or the inhibition of a reaction in va- 
rious ways, and finally a reaction in one definite way. On 
the subjective side, it is characterized, first by doubt, and 
secondly by affirmation or denial; on the objective side, it 
is made manifest first by a hesitancy in reaction, and a 
tendency to react in various ways without a completion of 
the reaction, and finally by a reaction, either positive or 
negative, in some definite way. When there is no doubt, 
when the meaning of the situation has in it nothing essen- 
tially new, then the thought does not go beyond the per- 
ceptual type of reaction. 
If I discover a yellow flower in a field, I may recognize it at once as 
a particular specimen of a variety with which I am familiar. Its 
nizaning is perfectly evident, though not in clear consciousness, and 
it is in no sense a matter of question or debate. I pick the flower, 
smell its fragrance, and put it in my buttonhole. On the other hand, 
I may come across another flower in my rambles over the fields that 
- I cannot quite so completely identify. Its nature, then, comes to me in 
the form of a question, and I finally make a judgment affirming that it is 
a certain type of flower with which I am familiar; or the judgment 
may take the form of a doubt in regard to its nature. Accompanying 
this subjective attitude of debate and decision, there is an objective 
310
-P-A-G-E-335
  The Thought Process in Judgment and Reasoning 311 
attitude. While I am questioning whether the flower is ill-smelling or 
fragrant, poisonous or harmless, I may inhibit my incipient tendency to 
pick it and examine it. Finally, when I conclude it is something of a 
harmless nature, this conclusion is objectively expressed in a definite 
and positive reaction to the flower. 
Such a process as this involves the bringing of a past 
experience to bear on a present situation. It is the in- 
terpretation of the new in terms of the old. jugpment 
It is the subsumption of the present narrower interprets 
experience under the broader and more inclusive cn 
experience. The judgment is well illustrated the old. 
by the definition. We say, for example, that iron is 
a metal. Here I place the narrower concept of iron in 
definite relation to the broader concept of metal. I may, 
however, find the same general principle in a judgment 
that is not in the strict sense of the word a definition, 
as when I observe, approaching in the distance, a person 
-~whom I do not at first recognize, and afterwards arrive at 
the conclusion that this person is my father. Here the 
narrower experience of the present moment is subsumed 
under the broader and more general experience of father. 
A judgment then arises when there is a definitely for- 
mulated question as to the meaning of the object of con- 
ception or perception, and the judgment is stated in a 
form which identifies it in some way with a broader 
knowledge into which it fits. In this sense it is at the 
very basis of the learning process, which has been defined 
as the determination of the present experience in terms 
of the past. It would be wrong, however, to consider 
such determinations on the lower levels of consciousness 
(and, indeed, in more developed consciousness that is 
proceeding along its ordinary course without marked 
interruption of the habitual responses) as anything more 
than implicit judgment, —in other words, situations that 
have in them the potentiality of judgment when thought 
crises arise.
-P-A-G-E-336
  312 The Learning Process — j 
The foregoing analysis should make the statement clear 
that perception, conception, and judgment are but different 
stages of the same fundamental process. In Perception, 4 ; , : 
conception, all, the past experiences function as attitudes 
ot oe. under present conditions ; in the perception the 
ent stages explicit aspect is reduced to a minimum, and 
pa lg exists in the mind ‘merely as an “attitudinal 
damental feel’ ;! in conception the bringing of the past 
mayer to bear in the interpretation of the present 
has become more of a conscious matter, and there appears 
a symbol in the core of consciousness that‘ stands for, 
or means, a type reaction in the present situation. In 
the judgment, this tendency has become more explicit 
and more highly focalized. A more developed form of 
the same fundamental process, found implicitly in per- 
ception and definitely and explicitly in conception, is 
inference. Here we have not merely a single judgment, 
but several, leading to some expressed conclusion. Logical 
thinking, both inductive and deductive, is a matter of 
inference. , 
The essence of the rational process, as has already 
been pointed out, does not lie in anything peculiar in 
regard to the manner in which the thought 
ees flows on. Like all other thinking, reasoning 
selectivein involves an end or termination of the proccss 
its nature. in some conclusion to which the thought is _ 
leading. The principal difference between_loose thinking 
and logical thinking has been discussed in the previous 
chapter, where it was insisted that logical thought must 
have its end clearly outlined and distinctly in view, and 
that it must hold this end in consciousness to the exclusion 
of all other considerations. To attain this result all su- 
perfluous thought processes must be eliminated, and the 
thinking must be carried out chiefly through symbols 
1 This expresses a fact similar to that termed by the German investigators 
the Bewusstseinslage, and by Bagley the “ marginal halo of kinzsthesis,”

    The Thought Process in Judgment and Reasoning 313 
and abstract methods of handling its data. The process 
of abstraction in this relation becomes extremely important. 
It consists essentially in grouping together in the thought 
processes those elements which contribute in some way, 
positively or negatively, to the final aim of the total 
rational process. How much the result of the thinking 
depends on selection, reconstruction, and positive control 
has already been insisted on, “and finds ample confirmation 
in daily life, and in the psychological experiment as well. 
Watt! has shown conclusively that the nature of the 
rational associations depends to a large degree on what 
he terms the Aufgabe (the task or problem) in the mind 
of the reagent. The same fact is also brought out in 
the results of Messer? in a subsequent experiment, con- 
ducted in the same laboratory (Wiirzburg), and with Watt 
himself acting as a subject. 
There are two ways in which the thought movement 
can take place. It may proceed from particulars to gen- 
erals, or in the opposite direction from generals : . Induction 
to particulars. These two processes have ordi- and deduc- 
narily been thought of as separate, but in actual tion not , . processes 
thinking, they are joined together in most entirely 
instances. As Dewey? points out, any complete S°Parate- 
movement of thought involves both induction and deduc- 
tion. Indeed, a high degree of certainty in reasoning can 
be reached only when both phases are equally emphasized. 
From a large number of particulars we arrive at some 
generalization. We then take this generalization and find 
how other facts fit into it. The various processes of logi- 
cal reflection are, according to Dewey as follows: ‘‘(i)a 
felt difficulty ; (ii) its location and definition; (iii) sugges- 
tion of a possible solution; (iv) development by reasoning

  314 The Learning Process 
of the bearings of the suggestion ; (v) further observation 
and experiment leading to its acceptance or rejection; that 
is, the conclusion of belief or disbelief.” This first stage 
of the process indicates a thought crisis. The habit- 
ual ways of reacting have for some reason been inter- 
fered with, and it is no longer possible to make the cus- 
tomary adjustments. In this state of mind, unless the 
emotional attitude becomes so dominant that it obscures 
clear thinking, the individual seeks to discover those 
elements in the situation which will suggest a way out 
of the difficulty. In attempting to locate the exact nature 
of this difficulty, he arrives eventually at some tentative 
conclusion or hypothesis. Further investigations show 
whether this hypothesis is tenable or not. After the 
hypothesis has been reasonably well established, it then is 
used to explain all the facts of the situation; and if this 
explanation serves, the difficulty is finally solved and an 
adequate reaction secured. 
The following illustration of the above principles of thought is given 
by Dewey:! “A man who has left his rooms in order finds them upon 
his return in a state of confusion, articles being scattered at random. 
Automatically, the notion comes to his mind that burglary would account 
for the disorder. He has not seen the burglars; their presence is not 
a fact of observation, but is a thought, an idea. Moreover, the man 
has no special burglars in mind; it is the vedation, the meaning of bur- 
glary, something general, that comes to mind. The state of his room is 
perceived, and is particular, definite, — exactly as it is; burglars are 
inferred, and have a general status. The state of the room is a fact cer- 
tain and speaking for itself; the presence of burglars is a possible ean- 
zug which may explain the facts. 
“So far there is an inductive tendency, suggested by particular and 
present facts. In the same inductive way, it occurs to him that his chil- 
dren are mischievous, and that they may have thrown the things about. 
This rival hypothesis (or conditional principle of explanation) prevents 
him from dogmatically accepting the first suggestion. Judgment is 
held in suspense, and a positive conclusion postponed. 
“Then deductive movement begins. Further observations, recollec-

tions, reasonings, are conducted on the basis of a development of the 
ideas suggested: zf burglars were responsible, such and such things 
would have happened; articles of value would be missing. Here the 
man is going from a general principle or relation to special features 
that accompany it, to particulars, — not back, however, merely to the 
original particulars (which would be fruitless or take him in a circle), 
but to new details, the actual discovery or non-discovery of which will 
test the principle. The man turns to a box of valuables; some things 
are gone; some, however, are still there. Perhaps he has himself 
“removed the missing articles, but has forgotten it. His experiment is 
not a decisive test. He thinks of the silver in the sideboard —the 
children would not have taken that nor would he absent-mindedly have 
changed its place. He looks; all the solid ware is gone. The concep- 
tion of burglars is confirmed ; examination of windows and doors shows 
that they have been tampered with. Belief culminates; the original 
isolated facts have been woven into a coherent fabric. The idea first 
suggested (inductively) has been employed to reason out hypothetically 
certain additional particulars not yet experienced, that oug/t to be there, 
if the suggestion is correct. Then new acts of observation have shown 
that the particulars theoretically called for are present, and by this 
process the hypothesis is strengthened, corroborated. This moving 
back and forth between the observed facts and the conditional idea is 
kept up till a coherent experience of an object is substituted for the ex- 
perience of conflicting details —or else the whole matter is given up as 
a bad job.” 
Perhaps one of the best illustrations of this method of 
reasoning is found in the ordinary procedure employed in 
the detection of crime. The commission of the , ; poe ‘ The selec- 
crime presents a definite crisis or difficulty that tion of sig- 
must be in some way met and solved. The 7ificant ; : acts essen-

isolated and separated from a large mass of similar facts ’ 
that have no particular importance as far as the commission 
of the crime is concerned. We have become familiar in 
Conan Doyle’s delineation of the character of Sherlock 
Holmes of a person whose chief skill consisted in the loca- 
tion of the essential facts bearing upon the solution of the 
problem.! The essential facts may seem trivial to the un-

skilled investigator, but they are the all-important elements 
of the situation inthe final outcome. James has suggested 
that reasoning correctly is essentially a matter of genius. 
The ability to reason well consists largely in the selection 
of the significant aspects of the situation, and this is what 
the skillfuldetective accomplishes. This it is, too, that lies 
at the basis of all great scientific deductions, discoveries, 
and inventions. Out of the enormous mass of seemingly 
irrelevant material, the great thinker selects those elements 
that lead to his hypotheses and that reveal ultimate facts. 
A large number of facts are not necessary. The impor- 
tant thing is to single out the szguzjicant facts. Indeed, 
too many facts may lead to confusion. The investigator 
is lost in the multiplicity of details, and cannot find in the 
wilderness of facts a path that shall lead him to the truth. 
you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without 
leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained 
observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch that has recently come 
into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have ‘an opinion 
of the character of the late owner ?” 
After examining the watch, Holmes concludes that it belonged to Watson’s 
elder brother, who was a man of untidy habits, and who, although left with 
good prospects, “lived for some time in poverty, with occasional short inter- 
vals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died.” 
These facts, Holmes explains to the astonished Watson, he discovers from 
observing seemingly trivial markings on the watch. The initials, H. W., onthe 
back of the watch, give a clueto the owner. The fact that the watch-case is 
cut and marked all over from the circumstance that other hard objects were 
kept in the watch-pocket with the timepiece, shows the owner’s carelessness, 
The value of the watch suggests that the owner must have had at one time 
other articles of value. Pin-point scratches, giving the numbers of pawn 
tickets, reveal the fact that the owner was often in financial difficulties; while 
the fact that he redeemed his pledges, since the watch was pawned at least 
four times, shows that he had occasional bursts of prosperity. Finally, the 
thousands of scratches around the keyhole — marks made by the key slipping 
—indicate that the watch belonged to a drunkard, who on winding it at 
night left the trace of his unsteady hand. 
This seemingly remarkable piece of induction was accomplished primarily 
because Holmes selected what to the ordinary person would appear unessen- 
tial features, but which in reality contained the solution of Watson’s question,

The Thought Process in Judgment and Reasoning 317 
The third step of the process in detecting a crime, or in 
arriving at a scientific generalization, is to obtain from the 
significant data the general point of view that 
shall make further investigation possible. This al 
step is what is ordinarily termed in criminal in- _ of 
vestigations “a clue,” and in scientific inquiry a 
tentative hypothesis. The great value of the clue and the 
tentative hypothesis lies in the fact that they turn the at- 
tention in such a direction that the selection of other facts 
that fit in with those which led to the formation of the 
hypothesis is relatively easy. It is remarkable what such 
a point of view will do in the further development of the 
logical process toward its conclusion. In this tendency of 
the rational processes to develop in the direction of a 
hypothesis lies a danger to accurate thinking, as well as a 
great aid. It is a well known fact that we are apt to find 
what we are looking for, and it is quite likely that we may 
approach the field of investigation with an unwarranted 
prejudice, and that our selection of facts to substantiate 
the clue or hypothesis will be tinged by our subjective 
prejudices. It is a notorious fact that when the detectives 
and police have once decided that a certain suspect is 
guilty, they are certain to find all sorts of evidence, a good 
deal of it untrustworthy, which will bear out their supposi- 
tions. For this reason, a person who has once been put 
down by the police as the criminal has great difficulty, al- 
though innocent, in freeing himself from the web of evi- 
dence which entangles him. Not only do detectives and 
others not skilled in logical reasoning make such an error 
as this, but even men of science, forming hypotheses too 
hastily or approaching their problem from a prejudiced view- 
point, are apt to find what they are looking for, although 
their conclusions may not be warranted by the fact. \ 
What James terms “ The Will to Believe” seems to be 
one of the most important elements in ordinary thinking, 
and it is extremely difficult to escape its effects. The ad.

vocate, in particular, who tries to prove his case uses only 
those arguments that will serve to substantiate it. Political 
debates are notoriously of this character. From The danger Bd ‘ 
of forming the same objective facts totally divergent con- 
hasty clusions are arrived at, because of the origi- hypotheses. . ‘ 
nal hypothesis, and the determination of those 
advocating a particular hypothesis to advance those argu- 
ments which will prove its correctness. For this reason 
the art of the rhetorician and of the public debater has 
since the days of the Sophists been open to:suspicion. 
Caring more to prove their point than to establish the 
truth in any particular instance, the Sophists acquired the 
unenviable reputation of being perverters of truth and 
morality. If, however, the hypothesis is carefully selected, 
and if the investigator keeps a mind open to those circum- 
stances that will throw light upon the subject of his inves- 
tigation, whether positively in favor of the hypothesis or 
negatively against it, the final conclusion may be accepted 
as reasonably trustworthy. Effective reasoning, then, does 
not consist so much in following logical norms as they have 
been elaborated in great detail in various texts, as it does in 
having certain correct attitudes of mind, and a genius to 
select those pariicular elements tn the situation that bear upon 
the problem. |

    CHAPTER XXII 
THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF RATIONAL 
THINKING 
SincE rational thinking involves a definite and clearly 
conscious end or aim, it is important at all stages of the 
learning process that the pupil keep his mind 
on the end to be arrived at in the lesson before ae ar 
him. This is the reason why a considerable form of the ‘ ‘ ; problem. 
part of the instruction should be cast in the 
form of a problem. This can be done almost from the 
beginning of the elementary school course, but only ina 
very simple way. Problems that are introduced should 
increase in complexity and difficulty as the pupil advances 
in grade and age.!_ The rational process in the form of 
1 It is an error to assume that children have little or no capacity for logical 
thought, until they have reached the upper grades of the elementary school or 
have entered the secondary school. Various studies have shown evidence of 
different forms of reasoning ability throughout the grades. Bonser, who 
studied children of the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades to ascertain their reason- 
ing ability (Zeachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Educa- 
tion, No. 37, New York City, 1910), found that, according to his tests, there is a 
gain from grade 4A to 6A for the boys of 338.77 per cent, and for the girls of 
246.15 per cent. The boys reach a maximum in median ability in the period 
from eleven to twelve years, the girls from twelve to thirteen years. Beyond 
the maximum there is a decline in ability for both boys and girls, the ability 
for boys being less from thirteen to fourteen than from ten to eleven. Both 
sexes advance after the decrease. In median ability the girls are superior to 
the boys in every grade. The boys show greater variability than do the girls, 
and they are superior to the girls in mathematical judgment and in the selec- 
tion of the significant elements ina rational process that lead to some particular 
conclusion. The girls, on the other hand, show superiority in the more simple 
associative discriminations and in the intellectual interpretation of literature. 
Bonser believes that “ this superiority may be due to the element of attention 
to detail, or patience in analysis, or a keener sense in the meaning of words 
and phrases, or a more accurate form of expressing their meaning, or a com- 
bination of all these.”

a problem is most easily exemplified by the work in arith 
metic. Examples of such problems as employed in Bonser’s 
_ tests are as follows : — 
John sold four sheep at five dollars each. He kept one half of the 
money, and with the other one half ‘he bought lambs at two dollars 
each. How many did he buy? 
A man spent two thirds of his money, and had eight dollars left. 
How much had he at first? ° 
What number added to sixteen gives a number four less than twenty- 
seven? 
If a train travels half a mile a minute, what is its rate per hour? 
While the problem appears perhaps most clearly in 
number work, it can be found in all subjects in the cur- 
ib aod riculum except those that are distinctly of the 
lem canbe nature of drill. Even in spelling the teacher 
as oh may present phases of the work in the form of 
the curricu- the problem, as, for example, when he asks the 
7 pupil to write down all the words in the reading 
lesson that contain in them certain syllables that he wishes 
to emphasize, or when he compares the meanings of certain 
words that are spelled alike, but pronounced differently. 
In the physiology lesson such questions should be asked 
as, ‘In what respects is the heart like a pump?” In the 
geography lesson, the teacher may inquire, for example, 
why the largest cities generally are situated on or neara 
large body of water. In the history lesson the question 
may be, “What were the qualities that Grant had that 
made him a good general?” Similar questions may be 
asked in work in science and literature. Of course this 
does not mean that all the instruction should be in the form 
ofaproblem. We have insisted all along on the necessity of 
drill, and it is further to be remembered that a large amount 
of what is interesting to the pupil in history and similar 
subjects lies in the simple narrative and in the descriptive 
elements, while explanations of historical events, in terms 
of their causes are apt to become uninteresting and even 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  a IIE III Ns 
The Educational Problems of Rational Thinking 321 
incomprehensible, if insisted on exclusively, or even largely. 
In nature’ study, too, and in geography, the descriptive 
and illustrative elements constitute the materials that 
arouse the greatest interest in the early years. Only 
occasionally in these subjects can the teacher demand 
causal explanations from the younger pupils. However, 
such explanations should be sought from time to time and 
their number should beincreased as the pupil advances in 
the grades. 
Equally important with the keeping in view of the end 
or problem in the rational process, is the selection by the 
pupil of those elements that bear upon this The pupil 
problem. Most of the questions cited in the must select 
above discussion involve for their intelligent ee ee 
answers such a selection. The pupil, however, ments ina 
must often be guided by the teacher in the selec- Deon 
tion of these elements. Such a device as that used by 
Bonser? in certain of his tests may be employed to advan- 
tage, with necessary modifications, in the ordinary work oe 
the school. 
The following are illustrations : — 
“The following reasons have been given to show why New York 
has become a larger city than Boston. As quickly as you can, place a 
cross like this, +, before each reason you think a good one: —

pine. 
g. Pine trees are sometimes used for Christmas trees. 
Io. Oak trees are easier to climb than pine trees.” 
It can be seen from the above examples that the process 
of reasoning required in these tests consists essentially in 
discovering those particular circumstances and facts that 
have significance in connection with the question in hand 
and the isolation and separation of these froma larger mass of 
similar facts that have no particular importance for the 
immediate problem. Suppose, for example, the teacher has 
asked the children to read about the oak and the pine tree. 
He then may further require them to write out the essential 
facts that they have learned from their lesson, and then to 
select those facts that have a particular szgvzficance for the 
problem which he may suggest in connection with the work. 
Such exercises as these, particularly for the higher grammar 
grades, are valuable in impressing upon the pupil care in 
the selecting of essential details 
The teacher should also keep in mind the importance of not present- 
ing too many details, or requiring the pupil to learn too many facts at 
any one time, since some of these are likely to be irrelevant as far as 
the particular problem is concerned, and are likely to confuse clearness 
in thinking for this reason. In the higher grades particularly, and in 
the work in the secondary schools, colleges, and universities, the mistake 
is often made of supposing that it is absolutely necessary to present 
every detail of a subject. This demand for completeness and thorough- 
ness, while desirable in itself, often defeats its own ends, for there can 
1 Compare the above discussion with that in Chapter XI, p. 178.

I IS 
The Educational Problems of Rational Thinking 323 
ve no completeness and thoroughness, unless the multiplicity of details 
are in some way mastered and constructed into a unitary system. In 
this connection it should further be remembered that, while it is desir- 
able to encourage questioning, especially on the part of the more ma- 
ture pupils, the teacher must exercise great pedagogic skill in keeping 
these questions within the general scope of the topic that is being dis- 
cussed. Students even of college grade are quite likely to raise queries 
that are often beside the point and confuse the main issue. The 
teacher here has a splendid opportunity of directing and limiting the 
questions in such a way as to impress upon the class the correct ideal 
of selective reasoning. 
Since conceptual thinking is an essential part of the 
rational process, the school should attempt, through presen- 
tation, comparison, discrimination, and the like, Wacesiity 
to develop adequate ideas in regard to the of adequate 
subject matter taught. These must be at first ee 
presented as vividly as possible. Vivid presen- subject 
tation demands the use of concrete materials ™*“* 
and laboratory methods of teaching. In commercial geog- 
raphy, for example, the materials of commerce should be 
exhibited in the classroom, and the different stages in the 
processes by which commodities are manufactured should 
be illustrated through samples of the materials in various 
stages of manufacture. When the actual concrete mate- 
rial is not present, charts, models, and lantern slides should 
be used. It must be remembered, however, that material 
should be used primarily for the purpose of illustration, 
and not for entertainment. It is highly desirable in teach- 
ing geography that the school should possess a varied 
collection of stereographic pictures and a sufficient number 
of hand stereographs. However, it is probably not wise 
to allow the pupils to use these indiscriminately. They 
should be used in connection with the particular lesson, at 
definite times, and not for the more general purposes of 
entertainment. While the teacher must insist on careful 
observation and comparison of facts, he must remember 
always that mere facts are nothing, and that innumerable
-P-A-G-E-348

aa The Learning Process 
facts are of no value in forming a conceptual idea, unless 
the essential elements in these facts are emphasized in the 
proper way. A large number of particulars are not al- 
ways necessary in order to bring out a general idea, and 
clearness of illustration is of no value unless the proper 
elements of the illustration are singled out and compre- 
hended. Above all, it should be kept in mind that a 
valid concept must somehow relate itself to an adjustment 
or the image of such an adjustment. The child must be 
encouraged to do something or to imagine something being 
done, if he is to arrive at a correct general idea. 
For example, if the pupil is being taught the nature of a river cur- 
| rent, he should be asked such a question as this: “If you were rowing 
in a boat upstream, would it be easier for you to keep in the middle of 
the stream or to row along its edges?” Or if he is being taught the 
meaning of high altitudes, he may be asked, “ Would it be as easy for 
you to run if you were on a lofty plateau as it would be on a similar 
level surface by the sea? Under which condition would you get out 
of breath sooner? If you were makinga balloon ascension, would it be 
necessary to provide yourself with warm clothing?” Such questions 
as these bring to the pupil’s mind the actual adjustments that he must 
make under such circumstances, and, therefore, give to the concept 
more than a merely formal significance. While it is sometimes neces- 
sary and advisable not to attempt to develop such concepts to their 
ultimate conclusions, it must be remembered that finally such conclu- 
sions must be arrived at if the results of instruction are to be vital and 
significant. 
Concepts are put in permanent forms, and are made fixed 
points of departure for thinking by means of the definition. 
a . Definitions, however, should not come at the 
of the defi- beginning of the exposition, but the end. They 
vt should sum up and crystallize the thought. 
There has been a tendency in recent years to undervalue 
the worth of definition, largely because its value had been 
overemphasized at an earlier period in the development 
of educational practice. While the definition, to be of 
value for the pupil, must be comprehended by him, and 
must be the result of previous thinking, rules of procedure
-P-A-G-E-349
The Educational Problems of Rational Thinking 325 
may properly be employed from the standpoint of mental 
economy, even before the fundamental reason for these 
rules is understood. It is not necessary, for example, that 
the pupil should always comprehend the significance of 
the rules that he puts into practice in long division, per- 
centage, square root, and the like. 
Since one of the most significant elements in rational 
thinking is the interpretation of the new situation in terms 
of previous experience, it is important that the pinciotes 
methods of procedure arrived at through school should be ; : ‘ employed in instruction should be employed in as many novel jany novel 
ways as possible. This can be done to unusual ways. 
advantage in those studies in the school curriculum that 
emphasize construction, such as manual training, in its 
several forms. This principle applies also to various 
kinds of laboratory practice, although it is not limited 
in its scope to any one part of the school program. 
The fact that rational thought invariably involves a 
crisis in the habitual mental processes makes it neces- 
sary at times to stir up the pupil to intellec- ihe 
tual unrest in order to break up his dogmatic watisn 
methods of thinking. It is the function of the ee 
teacher to guard against too great assurance 
and inertia in the reasoning of the pupil, who must be 
made to feel that complete dependence on his own pre- 
vious opinions and those of others is intellectual slavery. 
However, it must be remembered that such a radical 
method of procedure as is involved in raising serious doubts 
in regard to ordinarily accepted facts is not as permissible 
in the earlier as in the more advanced stages of education. 
Still the teacher in the pre-adolescent period should seek 
to inculcate in the minds of his pupils a certain caution in 
accepting general beliefs and statements simply because 
such statements are made. The pupil, although he is nat- 
_urally under the dominance of authority in this period of 
his development, and although for the most part he cannot 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
326 The Learning Process 
be taught to reason correctly by having his belief in such 
authority overthrown, still cannot be made with safety an 
absolute slave in his intellectual and moral life to the scien- 
tific and ethical standards of his parents and teachers. 
Both Freud and Jung have pointed out the danger of too 
much parental authority and reverence for this authority 
on the part of the child, in that child’s later development. 
The danger, however, applies less to American children 
than it does to the children of European parents. In 
America we have perhaps gone to the other extreme, and 
have not considered the great significance of authority for 
the child, particularly in his formation of religious and so- 
cial ideals. 
For the more mature students who have arrived at the 
middle adolescent period an attempt to shatter their naive 
dogmatism is often desirable and necessary. This 
ke is the principal significance of the Socratic peda- 
Socratic gogy. Socrates revealed to the youth of Athens 
pedagogy. their own ignorance by pointing out to them the 
utter untrustworthiness of their ordinary beliefs. In some 
cases he did more than convict them of ignorance; he 
tried to lead their minds to the higher truth. However, 
he emphasized the first step in the search after truth, the 
clearing of the mind of error in order to give place to a 
higher verity. 
While on the one hand dogmatic assurance leads to 
overconfidence and to a lack of scrutiny in the rational 
processes, on the other hand, the importance of A lack of ; ‘ ae

appeared as a transfer of mood in which the “ subject’s 
idea of himself from that of one being incapable of solv- 
ing such a problem to one capable of doing so probably 
played a part.” It is a familiar fact to teachers that the 
child’s general attitude in regard to his ability to do the 
work of the grade is extremely important. Often the 
backward pupil becomes a hopeless problem, not so much 
because of native inability, as because of the discourage- 
ment that repeated failures have developed in him.

points of view, arising from limited experience; extreme 
unwillingness to form conclusions, which is, however, not 
often characteristic of children, but generally of mature 
students of adult age. If these and other incorrect atti- 
tudes of mind can be eliminated, vastly more will be 
accomplished in training pupils to reason than can be 
attained by any study of, or practice in, logical form. 
It must also be remembered that consequences, not iso- 
lated facts, are the ends of thought. The child must be 
trained more and more to comprehend remote pis 
consequences, and to proceed from the practical quences, 
to the theoretical. At the same time care must aa ae 
be taken that theoretical thinking shall not ends of 
weaken the practical attitude. In school in- moteet 
struction methods should not be based exclusively on 
symbols and verbal forms, and overemphasis of instruc- 
tion of this character was one of the principal faults of 
the education of a few generations ago. It is equally 
fatal, however, to make the opposite mistake of dealing 
exclusively with objects. While interest may primarily

-P-A-G-E-352
  328 The Learning Process 
be aroused through dealing with concrete and narrowly 
practical situations, it must not end here. 
Finally it must be remembered that the most important 
of all attitudes for rational thought is that which springs 
Lich from a genuine love for truth. The noetic pas- 
love for sion is the most exalted and unselfish of all 
uate the human emotions, and when it becomes the ideal 
intellectual of the thought process, it changes the whole 
acyence- character of this process. We have already 
seen how this passion for truth begins as cu- 
riosity ; we have emphasized the fact that to it has been 
due the development of pure science which has brought re- 
sults of inestimable value to the human race. Truthknows 
no narrowly practical ends; it recognizes no private in- 
terests; it pleads for no special cause. For this reason it 
has been feared throughout the ages by those who have 
had selfish ends which they sought to promote. The 
statesman has often perverted it, and the churchman has 
put his ban upon it. Yet it has prevailed because of its 
own inherent strength and because error of necessity 
destroys itself through the sifting of the ages. 
No ideal as worthy as truth can be placed before the 
learner. The teacher who does not give truth the highest 
place, as the goal of education, is false to the service 
The teacher t0 Which he has been called. To strive for 
mustinsist truth, to make his pupils earnest seekers after 
3 truth, is his final and single duty ; it includes all 
others. No scheme of moral or religious education 
can substitute an ideal so exalted as the quest for truth. 
To pervert it in the interests of any cause, however worthy 
in itself, must lead to ultimate disaster. Centuries ago the 
Sophists, denying all objective values, and emphasizing nar- 
rowly practical ends, sought to teach their countrymen the 
art of reasoning as mere dialectic skill. They prided them- 
selves on their ability to prove their point, irrespective of 
its merit. The foremost rhetorician was he who could argue 
f
-P-A-G-E-353
The Educational Problems of Rational Thinking 329 
one side of the case on one day and establish his conten- 
tion; who could argue the opposite side on the succeed- 
ing day,and still gain the verdict. To-day two debating 
teams from the same institution of learning argue a question 
in one case to prove a proposition and in the other to over- 
throw it. Here, asin the days of Athenian ascendency, the 
end sought is not the establishment of some fact, but the 
victory of gaining a point; the merit that is emphasized is 
not that of rational excellence, but of disputative ability. 
Such a training has a value, especially for those who enter 
public life; but there is a great danger in allthis. Skill in 
argument, when coupled with a disregard for truth, is one 
of the most questionable of all accomplishments. The 
pupil must be taught to reason well, but paramount to this 
he must be taught to reason truthfully, otherwise, he is being 
trained in sophistry. To reason justly he must be made to 
recognize that truth has but one aim, to know itself. With 
this aim in view, it has a greater emotional uplift than any 
other fundamental human impulse. It is as deeply planted 
in the human life as are the economic and the social needs, 
and is capable of ranges of flight toward the ideal that are 
denied to other instinctive longings. Yet while this quest 
for truth takes upon itself the nature of a duty and may 
even be accompanied by a religious fervor, we are not 
for a mioment to suppose that truth is something abstract 
and apart from human life. Truth is immanent, not tran- 
scendent; it gives us a world of pulsating vital values, which, 
however, cannot be seen by the sordid eye of prejudice, 
nor comprehended by a mind dulled and besotted by nar- 
rowly practical and selfish ends.

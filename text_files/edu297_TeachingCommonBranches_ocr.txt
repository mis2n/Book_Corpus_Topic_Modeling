Durine the eleven years since Teaching the Common 
Branches was written, the advance in the technique of teach- 
ing has surpassed that of any previous half-century. This 
was demonstrated to the author’s complete satisfaction 
when he gathered the material together in preparation for 
the present revision. Heretofore, writers have presented 
new points of view or a new system of principles. But dur- 
ing the past decade an army of investigators has been work- 
ing upon the details of instruction with such efficiency that 
we are beginning to approach a science of teaching. Method 
is being applied to the field. 
Some school subjects have been studied more extensively 
than others. Notable among these are spelling, penman- 
ship, silent reading, the social sciences, and health educa- 
tion. In this period, too, the functional point of view has 
developed into the problem and project approach on the one 
hand and into diagnosis of difficulties as a basis for teaching 
onthe other. The development of standardized educational 
tests in several of the fields is an additional product of these 
fruitful years. 
Just as in writing the first edition the author felt that he 
had a right to attempt to perform the service of making 
available for the beginning teacher the functional point of 
view, which was just then being applied to teaching, so now 
he is interested in presenting to the same audience the ad- 
vances that have been made in the past decade in developing 
the details of that point of view. But with one important 
difference — from the standpoint of materials the literature 
has grown so voluminous that selection has been difficult to

the point where he has had to rely upon citations to supple- 
mentary references for a complete presentation of the meth- 
ods in each field. 
This new edition is therefore more than a revision. The 
book has been entirely rewritten, and new plates have been 
made. It is hoped that in its new form it will continue 
to be a source of help to the teachers and students of edu- 
cation. If this proves to be the case, the author will feel 
amply rewarded for his labor in rewriting the book. 
Acknowledgment of assistance is gratefully made to a 
number of recognized authorities in the special fields who 
codperated in the revision by providing, or checking, in each 
field the literature which described the present status of 
investigations. Specific acknowledgment is made to Miss 
I. B. Whitley, who took all the dictation, transcribed the 
notes, and helped to edit the manuscript.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION 
1917 
Since the publication of Teaching the Common Branches, im 
1913, an unusual amount of material has become available 
through the labors of many investigators. This is particu- 
larly true of the field of the curriculum in which a definite 
and substantial advance has been made. It is also true ina 
less degree of the field of methods of presentation. 
To gather this material from scientific monographs and 
textbooks in education and make it immediately available 
for the use of the teacher who does not know where to find it 
or who, through lack of technical terminology, cannot inter- 
pret it in its scientific form, the present revision of the text 
has been undertaken.
-P-A-G-E-6
  PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 
Tus book represents an attempt to write a simple text on 
the theory of teaching for students of teaching and for inex- 
perienced teachers, particularly in the rural schools. 
Most of the would-be teachers who take an elementary 
course in methods of teaching are destined to begin in coun- 
try schools. But most of the methods found in books on 
teaching have been worked out for graded schools, where 
there is more time, and where there are, on the whole, better 
teachers. The author has faced this problem by writing the 
present text primarily for rural teachers. The most prac- 
tical assistance to him in the task has been several years’ 
experience of his own as a country school teacher, several 
years more spent in training country teachers in a County 
Model School, and, very recently, some experience in teach- 
ing pedagogy to a group of young students in the University 
High School. This equipment has been supplemented by an 
examination of all the books used in the high-school normal 
training classes of those states that have them, and by sub- 
mitting the manuscript to certain experts who know country 
schools and the capacities of their teachers. 
In planning the textbook, three courses were open. First, 
the principles of teaching might be discussed with copious 
illustrations from the several subjects. This, however, 
would give a disjointed view of each subject. Or, the ab- 
stract principles might be stated briefly in the first four or 
five chapters and applied in detail to the different subjects 
in later chapters. Or— and this was the method finally 
selected by the author — the subjects might be treated sepa- 
rately, each explained and illustrated, and a general state- 
ment of these given in the last four chapters of the text.  
-P-A-G-E-7
PREFACE vii 
The reasons for adopting this plan are two. In the first 
place, it provides for an inductive treatment of the principles 
of teaching. After the student has seen how to secure inter- 
est in spelling, writing, arithmetic, reading, etc., he is able 
to understand the abstract statement of how to do it in all 
subjects; he can make his own generalizations and apply 
them. But, in the second place, many people do not know 
how to apply principles, and seemingly can never learn. 
This type of mind seems to handle a new situation by 
reference to a principle stated abstractly but by reference 
to another concrete case. For such, the last four chapters 
are of little use. Such teachers will use only the special 
methods. Hence, these methods should be treated fully. 
The number of pages devoted to each subject is no indica- 
tion of relative importance, for much space is taken in the 
earlier chapters to explain technical terms and illustrate 
general principles. 
The order of subjects in the first fourteen chapters was 
determined according to the teaching process most clearly 
exemplified therein. Spelling was selected as the first be- 
cause it is essentially a drill subject, and hence easy to dem- 
onstrate to beginners. In this subject, drill is emphasized. 
In reading, appreciation is emphasized; in drawing, an easy 
correlation with other subjects; in music, the parallel with 
written composition; in geography, the use of the imagina- 
tion; in arithmetic, the developing method; and in civics, a 
psychological organization based upon practical problems. 
Developed in detail in one subject, the principles are then 
applied in the subjects following. 
Each subject has been approached from the functional 
point of view. 
The references for class reading are not exhaustive; only 
those books that seem sufficiently simple for inexperienced 
teachers have been cited.

  viii PREFACE 
While special attention is paid to those modifications that 
are necessary because of the lack of time in rural schools, yet 
the author believes that the text will be of value to all 
teachers, whether in rural or graded schools.

script is made to State Superintendent W. D. Ross of Kan- 
sas, formerly Inspector of Teacher Training Courses in the 
Kansas high schools; to State Superintendent W. P. Evans

Courses in the high schools of Missouri; to G. W. Reavis,

TEACHING 
THE COMMON BRANCHES 
CHAPTER I 
SPELLING 
1. Subject-Matter 
Ws shall begin our studies of teaching with a description 
of spelling. In all the studies that are to follow we must 
remember that for the most part we are concerned with 
beginning teachers and with country schools where there 
is much haste and worry. Because of this, the methods 
that we suggest must be simple and direct and such as will 
take the least time possible to carry out effectively. 
Function. The first question that we shall ask of every 
subject is: What is its use, purpose, or function? for every 
subject has a different use or function. History is used 
to tell us what was done in the past; penmanship tells us 
how to make letters according to the different forms and 
with definite standards. Botany furnishes information 
about plants, zodlogy about animals; music instructs in the 
ways of producing sounds which go together to make 
pleasing combinations. Every subject has a function of 
its own which is entirely different from that of every other 
subject. 
Spelling is not peculiar in this respect. When we ask 
spelling to state why it exists, it might, had it the power of 
speech, answer as follows: “My function is to see that 
letters have the correct order in words.” “But,” we
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 SPELLING 
remonstrate, “writing has the same function, has it not?” 
Spelling replies, “No; all that writing has to do is to 
see that the letters are made properly. It does not care 
about the order of the letters. A word might be beau- 
tifully written according to the standards of writing, 
but be quite incorrect when judged by the standards of 
spelling.” 
If this correct order were not maintained what would be 
the result? This question is answered in different ways 
at different times. If we do not spell correctly, some say, 
people will think that we are not educated and will make 
fun of us. A sign over a business college in Chicago was 
ridiculed by the local newspapers because it read as follows: 
Spelling, Arithmatic, and Writing Taught Here.” Again, 
we may be applying for a position, and the presence of a 
misspelled word may injure our chances of getting it. 
Such a case once occurred when a college graduate wrote 
at the conclusion of his application: “ Yours respectively, 
John Smith.” Needless to say he was not seriously con- 
sidered. 
These are, however, inadequate reasons for learning to 
spell correctly. The real reason for learning to spell is to 
make sure that we may be understood. In spelling we 
place the letters in certain order so that people will know 
exactly what we mean. A man wrote to an acquaintance 
to buy him a “‘heavey” horse for farm work. He was very 
angry with the horse dealer for bringing him a heavey 
horse and was convinced of his mistake only when he saw 
that he had written “heavey” for “heavy.” He had 
thereby lost $100. An automobile dealer received the 
following letter from a correspondent: 
Dear Sire: Because you send me A Paid Envellope I SEnd you 
an answer I Have No Recolection of Applying to you to Purchase 
an Automobile I Am 82 years Old and very nervous Could Not —

possibly use one and would not accempt one if you would Give it 
to me Would Not undertake to Operate One No how Have No 
no money only a Little Pension money I draw as a Wounded 
Soldier was badly wounded on the Yazoo river in 1863 could not 
Operate Car no-how Rid in one only with great ereluctance 
Please excuse me from wanting such a charge to worry out my 
life Farewell. 
Here we are inclined to think of the writer as an object 
for ridicule and we have difficulty, moreover, in knowing 
exactly what he means. We can surmise what he is trying 
to say, but he is in a dangerous position because he has to 
trust to the reader’s good humor and intuition. Every 
time anybody misspells a word he has to depend upon 
the mercy of the one who reads it. He has no right 
to be understood. Inaccurate spelling means faulty 
communication and sometimes this inaccuracy is very 
expensive. 
Summary. The function of spelling is to enable us to determine 
accurately the order of letters in words in order that we may 
communicate values in writing. The penalty for poor spelling is 
the likelihood of being misunderstood and, furthermore, of losing 
the respect of the reader. 
Qualities and Ideals. In everything that we do we have 
to maintain certain standards if the work is to be well 
done and in spelling there are three which are of first im- 
portance. Spelling must be accurate. This is its out- 
standing characteristic, but in addition to accuracy, it is 
quite important that it should be performed with speed. 
Nobody likes to spell slowly or look up words of which 
he is not sure. It is very much better to be able to 
spell the word without thinking and still have it correct. 
But since few of us are absolutely accurate and have al- 
ways the speed necessary to dash the word off without 
thinking, a third quality is necessary — and that is the 
quality of sensitiveness to mistakes. Many children and 
adults spell incorrectly because they do not know when a 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 SPELLING 
word is wrong. So far as they are concerned it seems to be 
quite correct. 
These qualities become ideals when the person tries to 
attain them. We may, therefore, say that if spelling is 
to be well learned, the children should feel strongly the 
value of the three ideals — accuracy, speed, and sensitive- 
ness to mistakes. It is one thing for the teacher to possess 
these ideals for teaching spelling but it is quite another 
matter to have the children, on their own parts, want to 
possess them. The methods of intensifying the desire of 
the children for accuracy, speed, and sensitiveness, are em- 
ployed throughout the discussion in the remainder of the 
chapter. The methods that are suggested for teaching the 
subject take into account the fact that speed, accuracy, 
and sensitiveness to mistakes are being considered. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. Based upon the foregoing 
statements we may say that the teacher has three chief 
objectives in mind in teaching spelling, meaning by ob- 
jectives aims, intentions, or purposes. (1) He will seek to 
get the children to like spelling. They must have an 
aggressive interest in it because people learn very little 
when they lack interest. They do not throw themselves 
into it with all their power. They hang back. (2) The 
teacher will try to develop accurate, speedy, and sensitive 
spelling. He will not accept imaccuracies, misspelled 
words, without protest, but will work to have the children 
spell automatically and try to make them sensitive to mis- 
takes. (3) The teacher will not be satisfied with good 
spelling in the spelling class and poor spelling in geography 
and history papers. He will judge of his success in teach- 
ing by the absence of misspelled words in letters and 
themes. This, of course, is a very much harder task for 
him than to judge spelling upon the merit of the spelling 
papers, but clearly there is no use in learning to spell 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
    SUBJECT-MATTER 5 
accurately if we do not always use the knowledge when we 
write. 
A little friend of mine was said to be the best speller 
in the county. His reputation was based upon the fact 
that he had spelled everybody down in the county spelling 
match. He wrote to me telling me the good news and in 
the letter he said, “I was nervus for a wile,” so after all he 
was not a good speller, for one may lay claim to that dis- 
tinction only when he has no errors in his written work. 
The ability to spell orally is of little value to us since, 
in speaking, we do not have to spell. We need to spell 
only when we write, and by our writing our spelling is 
judged. 
Summary. It is the business of the teacher to develop. three 
ideals. He must develop in the children a liking for spelling; he 
must intensify the ideals of accuracy, speed, and sensitiveness to 
mistakes, and he must judge of the success of his pupils by their 
ability to spell words accurately in their written work. 
The Course of Study. There are several hundred thou- 
sand words in the English language.’ So many, in fact, 
that we cannot expect children to spell all of them. So 
the important question arises — what words shall be 
studied in school? These words, when selected, form what 
we call a course of study in spelling. 
There are three sources from which to draw the spelling 
lists. The first of these is the speller, about which we shall 
have more to say in a few pages. But it always happens 
that the teacher feels the necessity of supplementing the 
spelling list by words drawn from the books that children 
use in studying reading, history, or geography. The 
pupils are constantly, in these and other subjects, meeting 
words that they have not met before, and if we wish to 
increase their vocabularies it is necessary for us to make 
them acquainted with the words by pronouncing them,
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 SPELLING 
by a discussion of the meaning, and sometimes by spelling. 
The objection to selecting such words is that it’ takes a 
good deal of time; but I found by experience in my rural 
school that the amount of time need not be very great. 
I used, for instance, to mark six to ten words in less than 
a minute by having the pupils, while I named line and 
word, put a pencil dot under each of the words that I 
wished them to learn to spell. 
The third source from which to draw spelling words is 
the actual misspelled words of the children. Their papers 
are gone over and the words most frequently missed are 
selected for spelling. Indeed, it is quite clear in my mind 
that the words which each child misspells in his written 
work are the words upon which the greatest amount of 
time should be put in spelling. They are even more im- 
portant than the words in the spelling book. We are sure, 
then, that they are words which he is going to use in writ- 
ing because he has used them, and words with which he has 
difficulty. 
There are some who think that the child should be able 
to spell every word that he reads, but this is not true. If 
we read, we do not need to be able to spell, we need only 
to recognize the word, and if we never write the word it is 
not of great importance that we be able to spell it. Recog- 
nizing words is just like recognizing people. I can easily 
recognize a friend without being able to tell the color of 
his eyes, and so on. But if I wish to paint a picture of 
him I must know all these details. So, the reader merely 
recognizes, but the speller is like the painter — he must 
know the detailed order of the letters; he does not need to 
know this order if he does not write. 
Summary. Spelling lists may be made up (1) from the spelling 
books, (2) from words actually used in reading matter in each 
subject, (3) from the actual errors of pupils made in their written 
work,
-P-A-G-E-17
SUBJECT-MATTER 7 
The Spelling Book. The old-fashioned spelling book was 
filled with words which in many cases seemed to be selected 
at random, with a tendency on the part of the authors to 
pick difficult and unusual words. The basis of selection 
was very poor and differed for each book. Recently, how- 
ever, within the past ten years, a very large amount of 
work has been done by investigators in finding out exactly 
what words children and adults use when they write, and 
upon the foundation of this work some of the newer text- 
books are built. These investigators are asking two 
questions: (1) What words are used most commonly in the 
writing of children and adults? (2) How difficult is each 
word? Rather complete answers to these questions have 
been found and textbooks are now being based upon the 
lists and studies which these men have made. 
When spellers are properly constructed it is perfectly 
clear that they are very useful. They present the common 
words ,which every child should know. The words are 
printed and can therefore be quickly assigned, which saves 
much time. Since it is necessary to have spelling drills 
the spelling book is useful, as the children cannot be ex- 
pected to pick up the spelling of words without close 
attention to them. 
Frequency of Use. You may be interested in knowing 
something about the studies that have been made to 
discover what words are most frequently used by children 
and adults in their writing. Jones, for instance, read 
fifteen million words in the themes of 1050 children, tabu- 
lated them, found how often each one occurred, and from 
these fifteen million words he selected 4532 which were 
most frequent by the standards that he set up. Other 
studies have been made of the themes of children and 
several have been made of the written material of adults. 
In all these cases we are told which are the most common
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 SPELLING 
words, and these studies are available for the use of those 
who make the textbooks and for teachers as well. The 
best known of these lists is the thousand most common 
words collected by Ayres and found in the Ayres Spelling 
Scale, which can be obtained through your superintendent 
from the Russell Sage Foundation. A copy of it is also 
found in Rapeer’s Teaching Elementary School Subjects 
which is listed in the references for class reading at the 
end of the chapter. 
Frequency of Difficulty. The list to which we have just 
referred indicates the words most frequently used: by 
children and adults in writing. In addition to this, how- 
ever, the scholars have studied which are the most difficult 
words. This sort of study is, of course, very |important, 
because we naturally wish to spend most of the dias allotted 
to teaching spelling upon the hard words, since = children 
can already spell the easy ones. 
You will be interested to know that the eva which 
Jones found to be most frequently misspelled was not 
“asafoetida” or “parallelogram,” but “which.” The next 
most commonly misspelled were “there” and “their,” and 
“separate” had fourth place on the roll of dishonor. The 
one hundred words which he found to be most commonly 
misspelled were the following, which he calls the “100 
Spelling Demons of the English Language.” The order is 
not significant after the first four words.

Not only have the scholars been able to find out what 
are the most difficult words but they have shown us how 
much more difficult one word is than another. One method 
of doing this you can try out in your own class, by using 
the following table, taken from Tidyman’s Teaching of 
Spelling. By this table we can see that the word which 
is missed by from one hundred to ninety-seven per cent of 
the pupils in the class has, for the third grade, a difficulty 
of ten, while if it is missed by from one to four per cent

of the class it has a difficulty of two. Consequently, the 
first word is five times as difficult as the second. This is 
very important because, if we ask the children to write 
the second word ten times we ought to ask them to write 
the first word fifty times. It may be said parenthetically 
that the teacher should make use of this table as a kind 
of rough rule in deciding how much time and effort to put 
upon words. 
Specific Difficulties. In studying spelling it is not only 
necessary to discover the words which are most frequently 
missed by pupils in general as found in such a list as the 
“spelling demons.” It is still more important that we 
should know the specific spelling difficulties of the class 
which we are teaching and, in addition, the peculiar diffi- 
culties of each child. If the teacher knows what are the 
mistakes common to the class he can spend more time upon 
them. If, further, he knows what mistakes are most com- 
monly made by each child, he is able to give individual 
instruction to each. It is a matter of common observation 
that each child has his own pet difficulties. 
Tt is for this reason that the children should have the 
spelling lesson dictated to them before they study it. 
When this is done the teacher can see which words the 
pupil is already able to spell and therefore does not need to 
study, and those upon which he must spend his time. 
Graded Lists. You may be interested in having me carry 
the matter further and showing how the authors decide 
what words shall be taught in each grade in the spelling 
book. In general, we place in each grade those words which 
the children most commonly use in that grade. Jones 
picked out the words which appear for the first time in 
each grade in the themes which he studied. Those which 
were used by two per cent of the pupils in that grade were 
put in his list. But it is found that some of these words 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
INTEREST IN SPELLING il 
are very difficult to spell and so it has been decided to 
select the easier words for the lower grades and run them 
up in increasing difficulty to the advanced grades. In 
general, the shorter words are placed in the lower grades. 
This is done in the newer spelling books which are scien- 
tifically constructed. 
Length of Lesson. It is not advisable to have the spelling 
lesson longer than fifteen minutes, and ten minutes is quite 
satisfactory where spelling is taught every day. There is 
some difference of opinion as to the number of words that 
can be best taught in one lesson. The general tendency, 
however, is toward a shorter list. Probably four to six 
words, common words which the children understand, are 
about right. Horn, however, advocates the giving of a 
list of twenty-five words on Monday which the children 
will clean up during the week. His plan is to dictate all 
of these words on Monday before the children have studied 
them so that they and the teacher can see the words to 
which special attention must be paid during the five days. 
Summary. In general, the course of study in spelling should be 
based upon the words most commonly used by the children in 
writing, and attention must be paid to the words with which they 
have the greatest difficulty. Class instruction is based upon the 
words most frequently misspelled in the class and individual in- 
struction is based upon the difficulties of each child. The words 
in the spellers should be graded upon the basis of use and diffi- 
culty. No lesson should be more than fifteen minutes long, and 
from four to six words may be taught in each lesson. 
2. Interest in Spelling 
Interesting the Children. One of the most difficult 
things about the teaching of spelling is to keep the children 
interested in the subject. For most children it is very dry, 
but it must be admitted that some children enjoy it deeply. 
Particularly is it not interesting to those children who have 
difficulty with it. To them it is very exasperating to have
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 SPELLING 
to decide whether the word is precede or preceed when their 
memory is not very distinct in the matter and when there 
is no reason, so far as they can see, why it should be one 
rather than the other. 
Motive. One of our major problems, then, is to get the 
pupils interested in spelling or to so adjust conditions that 
they will have a motive. To say that one is interested ina 
subject is another way of saying that he has a motive for 
the study. One may, however, have other motives than 
that of interest. For instance, one may work for a thing, 
not because he is interested but because he needs it, or 
because he is envious of people who have it or avaricious. 
So we may be understood as meaning motive in its best 
sense, and when we speak of getting children interested 
we mean about the same as giving them a motive. 
Immediate Interest. Fortunately for some pupils they 
like spelling for its own sake. When you ask them why 
they like spelling the answer is the so-called feminine one, 
“Just because.” Pupils may love a subject because of the 
infectious enthusiasm of the teacher who is himself fond 
of it, or they may be naturally attracted to it. When a 
subject is loved for its own sake it is said to be of “im- 
mediate” interest, and when this point has been reached 
the goal is attained. So now let us take up a far more 
difficult question. 
Mediate Interest. What is the teacher to do when the 
children are not interested in spelling? That is to say, if 
there is no immediate interest in the subject how can inter- 
est be put into it? Using a more technical term we may ask, 
“How can mediate interest be aroused?” If we are looking 
for a rule the answer to this is very simple, though it is 
reasonably hard to apply the principle. The abstract state- 
ment is given very well by James as follows: “Any object 
not interesting in itself may become interesting through 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
INTEREST IN SPELLING 18 
  becoming associated with an object in which an interest 
already exists.” 
This gives us a very simple plan for getting mediate 
interest in spelling. If the children are not interested in 
spelling then we must find something in which they are 
immediately interested and associate spelling with it. 
Nothing could be easier to state. Our real trouble begins 
when we try to find those things in which the children are 
already interested and with which spelling can be con- 
nected. 
Nevertheless the task is not at all impossible and there 
are two groups of method quite different in spirit which 
are used in motivating spelling, and, for that matter, prac- 
tically every other subject in the course of study. 
Appeal to Generic Values. We have a long list of in- 
terests of children which can be appealed to in any subject 
because they are common to all effort. They are called 
“generic values” or “generic interests.” Immediately we 
think of the making of grades as one of these. If the child 
wishes for any reason to make high grades, he will take an 
interest in spelling if he sees that his grade is low. Belong- 
ing to this same class are such interests as avoiding punish- 
ment, avoiding scoldings and reprimands, getting the good 
will of the teacher and his parents, and getting ahead of 
other people through a spirit of rivalry. These are examples 
of the generic interests to which teachers quite commonly 
appeal. 
One of the chief difficulties about using this method is to 
find things that are of immediate interest to individual 
children. For instance, a teacher might use shame, think- 
ing that the avoidance of shame was of immediate interest, 
but the pupil might not study any better because he, per- 
sonally, did not mind the sarcasm of the teacher. We 
might think that the twelve-year-old boy would be shamed 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 SPELLING 
by staying in after school, by sitting with the girls, or by 
being suspended, but unless these are things for which he 
cares they will furnish no motive for him to study anything 
in which he is not interested. 
Summary. In getting mediate interest in spelling one method 
is to make an appeal to certain generic values which are of imme- 
diate interest. 
Appeal to Specific Need. The foregoing type of interest 
is always at hand for the teacher to use wisely if he desires 
to do so, but since it applies to all subjects we are justified 
in asking ourselves the question, “Are there any special in- 
centives that apply to spelling alone?” 
The answer to this is quite clear. Spelling has an in- 
trinsic function, which is that of helping us to communicate 
our ideas accurately through following a proper letter order 
in words. We use spelling to communicate ideas accu- 
rately. If, then, we fail to communicate ideas accurately 
because we spell inaccurately we have a specific need for _ 
learning to spell correctly. 
If children are really interested in what they write they 
will be sorry to be misunderstood because of poor spelling. 
Of this the case of the “heavey” horse mentioned before is 
an illustration. I venture to say that the man who wrote 
the letter had a strong motive for, and felt a keen interest 
in, spelling every time he wrote a letter for a long time 
afterward. Such incidents the teacher should collect and 
keep for purposes of inspiration and for the reinforcement 
of the desire to spell correctly. 
This is the natural source back to which we go for getting 
a specific interest in spelling. If we can develop in children 
a love for writing and for being accurate and speedy in 
their spelling so as to write with greater efficiency, we are 
using the most intelligent method of developing a strong 
motive for the study of the subject. Clearly, however, if
-P-A-G-E-25
  
INTEREST IN SPELLING 15 
the child is not interested in writing well, he will not be 
greatly concerned about whether or not he spells well. 
Methods for getting children to like composition will be 
discussed in the proper chapter. 
We may use this method to intensify an interest in 
spelling by getting the children to study their own diffi- 
culties. It is quite one thing to give them a list of words 
to spell and quite another to get them to realize that with 
some of these words they have more difficulty than with 
others. The generic desires to finish a job well begun, to 
conquer stubborn difficulties, and to see improvement 
supplement the specific need for spelling. 
Summary. Another method of getting interest is to find out 
the specific use of spelling and help the children to realize and 
correct their difficulties. 
A High Degree of Skill. It is a matter of common ob- 
servation that people seldom like things which they are 
unable to do well without trying hard for a long time. 
What usually happens is that we get enough interested in 
something to start at it, but if we fail to show sufficient 
improvement to satisfy us the interest wanes. On the 
other hand there are many things that we do so well that 
we lose interest in them. But in between the very diffi- 
cult things in which we have no interest and the very easy 
things in which we have lost interest there lies a group of 
things which are neither too easy nor too hard. So, in 
spelling (as in other subjects taught in school) it has been 
discovered that as children become more skillful in the 
subject their interest increases. Consequently one way of 
developing interest is to teach the subject so well that 
proficiency is developed. Particularly useful is praise in 
this connection. Children sometimes do not know that 
they are excellent spellers or that they are improving. Their 
attention may be centered upon their mistakes, with the
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 SPELLING 
result that they become discouraged. The generous use 
of praise when effort is being put forth is absolutely es- 
sential in handling boys and girls who are trying hard to do 
their reasonable best. 
Making Difficulties Individual. Children also develop in- 
terest in something which is their very own, because owner- 
ship is one of the deepest of human instincts. It may seem 
comical to say that children can be made interested in 
spelling by having them own some difficulties, and yet it is 
demonstrably true. A boy who had no interest in spell- 
ing actually developed considerable interest in it when he 
began to keep a list of the words with which he had par- 
ticular difficulty. He was rather proud of the ownership 
of his “demons” and grew to love them so much that he 
talked about them and, interestingly enough, worked hard 
upon them to conquer them. He felt that his troubles were 
more serious than those of other pupils. He boasted that 
his seatmate missed the easy ones but that the words that 
he missed were such that only a bright youngster could 
handle them. Whatever may be the emotions that accom- 
pany the ownership of difficulties, it is nevertheless true 
that children’s interest in spelling is greatly intensified when 
they study it as their own particular problem and feel that 
they are not wasting time on words which they can already 
spell. 
Summary. To supplement the appeal to specific need, use 
should be made of the fact that up to a certain point increase of 
proficiency causes increase of interest, and of the further fact 
that pupils are most interested when they see that they are work- 
ing upon their own individual problems. 
The Project Method. So much current attention is being 
paid to what is known as the “project method” of teaching 
that its relationship to the methods developed in this text 
should be shown.
-P-A-G-E-27
  INTEREST IN SPELLING Ww 
As I understand the project, it has two characteristics. 
In the first place, in a project the child does a great deal of 
thinking in the effort to solve some large problem, and in 
the second place each problem is so staged that it can be 
worked out under natural conditions which have not been 
affected by the school. In studying agriculture by the 
project method we think immediately of a garden project. 
Tn this project the boy actually raises a garden at home 
on his father’s farm, under the conditions that prevail 
there. He prepares the soil, selects the seed, plants it, and 
does everything else that is necessary in order to grow 
vegetables, as intelligently as he can. During the whole 
process a great deal of thinking and studying is required, 
and while he is attending to his garden he studies in school 
all the facts that he can find about how to do his work well. 
In this illustration we have both characteristics. The 
work is done in its natural setting and it is carried on as a 
large problem on which the student has to do a very great © 
deal of thinking. 
When we apply ourselves to spelling and try to think 
of some large problems that the boy faces in connection 
with spelling, we immediately run upon the correction of 
his difficulties. We can make methods of learning spelling 
a project. If we say to him, “ What can you do to learn to 
spell better?” and he answers, “I ought to study more 
intelligently,” it is a project. He really has to study how 
to study well and we can help him in the following way: 
(1) We can help him to analyze his difficulties. This means 
that he will become aware of the words that cause him the 
greatest trouble and the words which he spells well. (2) 
We can help him to learn how to improve his spelling, as 
will be shown later in the chapter. (3) We can help him 
to measure his progress by having him keep track of his 
spelling errors and by giving him tests.
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 SPELLING 
When he takes the methods of improving his spelling as 
a problem, he has a real project which may prove very 
interesting to him and which will use all the intelligence of 
which he is possessed. 
The project method applied in this way has very great 
superiority over the usual procedure. Ordinarily, we 
assign a spelling lesson and direct the children to spell each 
word correctly. If the spelling lesson consists of ten 
words they have ten little tasks to perform and they do 
them rather automatically. But as soon as we set before 
the pupil the project of making himself into an excellent 
speller and invite his codperation and assistance, we may 
call forth a great amount of intelligent effort which would 
otherwise lie dormant. By the old method of assigning 
words to spell the teacher takes all the responsibility. By 
the new method of putting up to the pupil the problem of 
studying his own difficulties, the responsibility is shifted, 
in a sense, from the shoulders of the teacher to those of the 
pupils. 
It may be said parenthetically that spelling is frequently 
used in connection with other projects. For instance, the 
boy with a garden project may have to make out bills and 
reports, in the doing of which spelling is necessary, but his 
work on spelling is not, in that case, strictly a spelling 
project. 
Summary. A project may be defined as a large problem car- 
ried on under natural conditions and involving the maximum of 
intelligent thinking. One spelling project is that of discovering 
methods of study for the improvement of individual spelling. 
3. Learning to Spell 
Diagnosing. Several years ago when I was taking a 
course on methods of teaching, everybody was searching 
for a few general methods that would handle all the prob-
-P-A-G-E-29
  LEARNING TO SPELL 19 
lems of teaching. We had an ardent hope that such a 
system could be found. But more recently the point of 
view has very strikingly changed, due partly to the fact that 
we could find no general methods that would solve all prob- 
lems, and partly to the introduction of scientific methods. 
If this change could be summed up in a sentence it would 
be this: “In finding solutions to the problems of teaching 
we now use diagnosis and analysis.” By diagnosis we 
mean just what the doctor means; that is, when we have 
something wrong with us and go to the doctor, the first 
thing he does is to study us closely, take our temperature, 
our pulse, our blood pressure, and perhaps take X-ray 
pictures of us. Working from these facts he finds out 
exactly what is wrong with us, and, when he has found the 
trouble, he tells us what to do to correct it. 
Similarly, in school the careful and scientific teacher. 
studies the difficulties that the children have in learning. 
He analyzes them, makes his diagnosis, and then finds 
some way of helping them cure the difficulty. 
Let us illustrate in the case of spelling. When children 
spell incorrectly the first question that we ask is — What is 
the trouble? Then when we have found the trouble we 
try to cure it. For instance, Cornman, who has analyzed 
the mistakes made in spelling, finds the following types of 
mistakes which you can easily recognize as being common:

(3) Unclassified. Everything else — “ Soe it > 
SHANMEDO MGs: cnet or ea ce fe 064 
But we need to analyze the mistakes further before we 
can find out how to cure them. When we do this We may 
find out that frequently the mistakes are due to careless- 
ness, to wrong pronunciation, or to ignorance of the meaning 
of the word. Occasionally the error may be due to poor 
eyesight. Let us take illustrations from Cornman’s list. 
With that in hand, we can see a reason for spelling “‘ Maine” 
as “main.” The child is already familiar with the spelling 
of the word “main” before he studies geography. In the 
words “swin” and “aminal” we see slips of the pen. The 
same is true of the word “speel.” The misspellings of 
“Wednesday” and “scholar” are due to the fact that they 
are pronounced as they are spelled in the table. “Chim- 
ley” and “dest,” also, are probably misspelled for the same 
reason. 
It is, therefore, absolutely essential to good instruction 
that the teacher study the misspellings of children to dis- 
cover just why they make the mistakes they do. When this 
is done he can work more intelligently upon the methods
-P-A-G-E-31
LEARNING TO SPELL 21 
of curing the difficulties, particularly by knowing what 
to point out to the children. For instance, in curing the 
error “Wensday” it is perfectly clear that in the correct 
spelling “Wednesday” careful attention should be paid to 
the “dnes” by underlining or the use of colored crayon, or 
by explaining to them that “Wednesday ” means “‘ Woden’s 
day” and was named for the Teutonic god, Woden. In 
handling the word “chimley” it is necessary to teach the 
children that the pronunciation is not “chimley” but 
“chimney.” It is therefore quite apparent that if we are 
to use diagnosis we need to have the children spell the 
words in the spelling lesson before they study them, so that 
we can find out, and they too can see, which words they 
can spell correctly. Then when the teacher has given this 
preliminary test he analyzes the misspellings to see just 
what the difficulty is, and when he teaches the correct 
spelling’ of the words he can lay stress upon the difficult 
parts that need the most attention. 
Summary. The scientific teacher diagnoses the spelling diffi- 
culties of the children to discover the causes and in teaching he 
ates to find methods by which each specific difficulty can be 
removed. 
Types of Imagery. Before proceeding to methods of class 
instruction I shall take time to call to your attention cer- 
tain facts about the types of imagery that children possess, 
and the general laws of habit which drill lessons should 
follow in order to be effective. Mental images are of many 
kinds. We have images of taste, smell, sight, hearing, and 
touch, and motor, or kinzesthetic, images. Many of us can 
close our eyes and see quite clearly the faces of people or 
the words on the pages of some book which we have studied. 
We may also be able to remember quite clearly the smell 
of the woods on a wet fall day, the odor of a rose, or of 
freshly ground coffee. We may also be able to recall the  
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 SPELLING 
taste of quinine or a chocolate sundae. These impressions 
are all called images. 
In spelling we use some of these images. For instance, 
some people may say, “The spelling of that word does not 
sound right.” They can hear the sounds “in their heads” 
just as many people can hear tunes. Other people may 
say that spelling does not look right. They compare it with 
the memory picture stored in their minds. Again, some 
people cannot be sure of the spelling until they have spelled 
it over to themselves and they recognize the “‘feel” in their 
throats, or they write it out rapidly and allow the hand to 
have full play in the writing. That is to say, some people 
are strongly of the visual type, others are of the audile 
(hearing) type, and still others are motiles (motor type). 
Most people combine ali three types, but the visual is 
generally the strongest. That is, most people in deciding 
whether a word is right or wrong first look at it. They 
may then spell it aloud or, in very obstinate cases, write 
it out, but usually they resort to visual images first. 
This means that in spelling liberal use of all three types 
should be made. Pupils should pronounce the words 
(auditory), spell them over to themselves, either aloud 
(auditory) or under the breath (motor), write them out 
(motor), and look at them (visual). All three are effective 
and by their use each student will learn to rely upon the 
methods which for him are most efficient. 
Summary. There are several different types of imagery, used 
in varying degree by different people. Care should be taken to 
see that all types are given a chance in drill work on spelling. 
Laws of Habit. Learning to spell is simply a matter of 
habit. What is desired is the ability to write down a word 
as soon as the need occurs without thinking about how it 
should be done. For instance, as I write here I think of 
words that I wish to transcribe to paper; since I am a
-P-A-G-E-33
    
LEARNING TO SPELL 23 
fairly good speller I am able to write them down, correctly 
spelled, without thinking about them very much. If I had 
to stop to think about how each word is spelled or to look 
it up in the dictionary, I should waste much valuable time 
that I can now spend in thinking about what I am going to 
say. 
The ability to write words without having to think about 
the spelling is spoken of as the ability to spell automatically. 
To set up automatic spelling habits is the aim of all at- 
tempts to teach the subject. In forming a habit of this 
sort there are just four things to do; the statement of these 
is very simple, but unfortunately it is much harder to 
perform the task. 
Getting a Clear Picture, The first thing to do is to get 
the pupils to pay close attention to the words to be memo- 
rized. They must get a clear picture of them. The word 
should be written upon the board. The pupils should 
each pronounce the word because incorrect pronunciation 
is the cause of one-half of the cases of poor spelling. The 
syllables should be pointed out and the word should be 
spelled by syllables; the difficult parts of the word should 
be emphasized by being underlined, written in colored 
chalk, or inclosed in a circle. Diacritical marks, however, 
should not be used. To us who are grown up crit’-i-cize 
looks like criticize, or scis’ sdrs closely resembles scissors, 
but to little children there is as much difference between 
these forms as there is to you and me between a woman 
with her hat on and the same woman with her hat off. You 
or I could learn to know her with her hat off, yet we might 
be entirely unable to recognize her when we met her with 
it on. 
Attentive Repetition. The second thing that the student 
needs to do in forming spelling habits is to repeat the words 
over and over. In doing so the word may be spelled aloud,
-P-A-G-E-34
    
4 SPELLING 
written out, or spelled to one’s self; or it may be repeated 
in two of these ways. For instance, the pupil may write 
it out, look at it carefully, or spell it aloud or under his 
breath, but mere repetition amounts to little unless it is 
attentive. The boy may say that he studied his spelling 
lesson for a half-hour, when as a matter of fact he merely 
sat with the book before him for thirty minutes, and 
studied his spelling only five times, for a minute at a time, 
with five-minute periods between, during which he was 
thinking of something else. Psychology tells us that we 
memorize more easily when the periods of attention are 
short. Five minutes at night and five minutes in the 
morning will produce better results than ten minutes all 
at one time. 
Repetition is secured in some schools by reviewing the 
same words from day to day, and, after letting them rest 
for a time, reviewing them again at the end of each month 
and the end of the year. 
Spelling should, however, be studied chiefly through 
writing. It is used in writing only and habits closely con- 
nected with writing should be set up as firmly as possible. 
Part of the method of study might include the writing of 
the words in sentences. 
Automatic Control. The third important fact to bear in 
mind is that unless spelling is made automatic, all the 
labor is lost. That is to say, in the spelling of superficial as 
s-u-p-e-r-f-i-c-i-a-I the letters must follow each other with 
rapidity, and certainly without thought. It will not do 
to spell swp and then stumble over er or to spell superf and 
stumble over icial. This point is very important. If the 
child cannot learn to spell glibly at one sitting he should 
make two or three additional attempts. Speed is to be 
sought for at the expense of everything but accuracy. This 
is another reason for not having too many words in one
-P-A-G-E-35
LEARNING TO SPELL 25 
lesson; for with many words it is a physical impossibility 
to make them all automatic within the time allowed, and 
if they are not made automatic, little real good is accom- 
plished. A few words, well learned and frequently reviewed, 
make a nucleus that grows rapidly from week to week and 
from year to year. 
Satisfaction. The fourth fact to be borne in mind is that 
practice will not be continued and habits formed if the 
practice does not give satisfaction. We do not do anything 
efficiently if we do not like to do it. When we have to 
drive ourselves we slight the task. But, conversely, if we 
enjoy the practice we give all we have to it. So, in de- 
veloping habits, it is necessary to stimulate a love for the 
practice. This can be done by praising efforts, by showing 
that improvement is appearing, by contests and rivalry, by 
setting the task of topping our own records, and so forth. 
Summary. In drilling on words there are four things to ob- 
serve: first, a clear picture; second, attentive repetition; third, 
repetition enough to make the spelling automatic, and fourth, 
the resulting satisfaction. 
Methods of Teaching. The following directions are 
gathered from the book by Tidyman and the report by 
Horn which are listed at the end of the chapter, material 
which should be in the possession of all elementary school 
teachers or available to them in school libraries. The 
summary is thrown into the form of twelve statements: 
(1) Before beginning to teach the spelling of a list of 
words the teacher should dictate the words to the children 
to see what mistakes they make. He should run over the 
errors and notice the difficult parts of each word. 
(2) The word to be studied should be placed on the 
board and pronounced. It is important that the pronun- 
ciation should be accurate and the enunciation distinct. 
(3) Its meaning should be defined by being used in  
-P-A-G-E-36
  
26 SPELLING 
enough sentences and in enough discussion that all the 
children may clearly understand the meaning. It is ridic- 
ulous to have children spend time learning to spell words 
of which they do not know the meaning, since, obviously, 
if they are ignorant of what they mean they will not use 
them in writing. 
(4) The word should be written on the board in syllables, 
without diacritical marks, and hyphens should not be used 
between the syllables. 
(5) The children should pronounce the word slowly by 
syllables, with a clear visualization of each syllable. This 
step should not be hurried over, since syllabication helps 
pronunciation. When the teacher is in doubt about the 
syllabication of a word he should look it up in the dic- 
tionary. By visualization this is meant: (Let us illustrate 
from the word pre cede, which you can try for yourself.) 
You can visualize it if you look at the word, say pre and 
then pause long enough upon it while looking away, to get 
a visual picture of it in your mind, separate from the 
syllable on the board. Then when you say cede, if you 
pause, you can get the image for that syllable in a similar 
manner. 
(6) Fix the children’s attention upon the difficult parts, 
if any. What these are you can discover from the pre- 
liminary test, the results of which you have already studied. 
In precede the difficulty is probably found with cede. In 
Wednesday the trouble lies in dnes, in scholar with the h, 
and so on. In fixing attention, numerous devices can be 
used. Some of these have been mentioned, such as using 
underlining, colored chalk or ink, or light circles around 
the difficult part. Sometimes contrast with other words 
helps, as in teaching principle when the children already 
know principal. Attention may also be called occasionally 
to the rules for dropping silent letters, as in writing. The
-P-A-G-E-37
  LEARNING TO SPELL wt 
resourceful teacher can easily think for himself of simple 
devices that will make the difficult parts prominent. 
(7) Have the children look away from the word and try 
to see it while they spell it to themselves, or perhaps they 
may be told to close their eyes and try to see the word. 
After they have seen it for themselves, they may quickly 
look back at the word on the board to see whether it is 
as it looked to them when they looked away from it. This 
exercise is intended to strengthen the visual image. 
(8) Have the children, collectively and individually, pro- 
nounce the word and spell it aloud several times. 
(9) Then have them write the word out several times and 
while they write it have them pronounce and visualize it. 
The number of times the word should be written can be 
roughly determined by reference to the table given above 
on page 9. 
(10) Provide for frequent review drills on the difficult 
words. This can be done both as class and as seat work. 
Words can be reassigned and all the children told to prepare 
for the test or review, or they can be asked to review the 
class difficulties or they can be asked to study the words, 
for fun, as seatwork, without feeling that they are pre- 
paring for a class review. In addition, when each child 
gets a list of his own difficulties he may be set the task of 
reviewing his own list to see how successfully he has learned 
it. It is very important that seat study of this sort should 
be scattered at regular intervals throughout the month 
or the year. As stated above, no method is more effec- 
tive in getting the children to like spelling than to show 
them that many words which they spelled incorrectly at an 
earlier time in the year are now easy for them to spell 
correctly. 
(11) After the words have been taught and studied, they 
should be dictated to the children in the class period. The
-P-A-G-E-38

children should then be given opportunity to look them 
over and after an exchange of papers the words should be 
spelled by the teacher or by members of the class and the 
children should mark the words which are incorrect. Those 
which still give difficulty should be placed in the class 
spelling list for further review and study and each pupil 
should add his own mistakes to his own list, which he keeps 
in a book, for further study on his part. 
(12) Horn has used the following directions for the boys 
and girls in his school to teach them how to study words at 
their seats, outside of the class period: 
HOW TO LEARN TO SPELL A WORD 
1. The first step in learning to spell a word is to pronounce it 
correctly. If you do not know how to pronounce a word, 
look up the pronunciation in the dictionary. When you are 
certain that you know how the word is pronounced, pro- 
nounce it, enunciating each syllable as you say it. 
2. Close your eyes and try to recall how the word looks, syllable 
by syllable, as you pronounce it in a whisper. In pronounc- 
ing the word be sure to enunciate the syllables carefully. 
. Open your eyes to make sure that you were able to recall the 
correct spelling. 
. Look at the word again, enunciating the syllables distinctly. 
- Recall again, with closed eyes, how the word looked. 
. Check again with the correct form. This recall (as in 2 
and 5) should be repeated at least three times, and oftener 
if you have difficulty in recalling the correct form of the 
word. 
‘7. When you feel sure that you have learned the word, write 
it without looking at the book, and then check with the 
correct form. 
8. Repeat this two or more times without looking either at the 
book or at your previous attempts. 
9. If you miss the word on either of these trials, you should 
copy it in your spelling notebook, since it probably is es- 
pecially difficult for you. Doe CO 
The Use of Words. We have said on several occasions in 
this chapter that the success of a teacher in teaching spelling
-P-A-G-E-39
    
LEARNING TO SPELL 29 
is judged by the number of words which the children can 
spell correctly in their letters and themes and we repeat it 
here because of its extreme importance. I wish to present 
three things that the teacher may do to help the children 
to become careful about this matter. (1) The children 
should be taught to go over anything that they write for 
the spelling before they hand it in or send it through the 
mail. This should be insisted upon by the teacher at the 
beginning of the year and continually thereafter until each 
child has made it a matter of habit. Time should always be 
given for this, no matter how hurried the day. (2) How- 
ever, much time can be saved if the children are taught not 
to write a word down, if they are in doubt about its spelling, 
until they have checked up on it. This means that with 
older children the dictionary habit should be developed. 
Even in small dictionaries they can get a good deal of help 
and, within limits, they may ask a good speller in the class 
how the doubtful word is spelled. (3) Tidyman mentions 
an interesting method of teaching children to be sensitive 
as to correct spelling. He says that children may occa- 
sionally be required to check their own papers for correct- 
ness before handing them in. They may place the marks 
(Vv), correct; (x), incorrect; and (d), doubtful, over the 
words as they pass judgment upon them. The teacher 
may mark both the correctness of the judgment and the 
correctness of the spelling. If the children see that their 
judgment is correct it helps to make them more sure of 
themselves and if they see that their judgment is not good 
they are given an added incentive for greater attention to 
spelling. 
Standard Tests. While the number of misspelled words 
per page in the children’s writings is the final basis for deter- 
mining their efficiency in spelling it is possible to use 
standard tests or spelling lists as a partial basis for judging 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  
30 SPELLING 
of the efficiency of teaching. The best known of these 
standard tests is that of Ayres, which presents 1000 of the 
most common words arranged in columns according to 
difficulty and with standards of accomplishment for each 
grade. This test has already been referred to above. 
Such tests are of value in determining the average effi- 
ciency of classes and should be used if you wish to discover 
how well your children spell in comparison with other 
children. You can do this by selecting a list of ten or 
twenty words from the dolumn which is about medium in 
difficulty for the class which you are testing. Standard 
tests are not, however, of very great use in measuring the 
efficiency of the work that is done during the year unless 
the words that are taught are those in the lists. It can be 
seen at once that this is what might be expected because 
children might learn to spell other words well without 
improving in those which are given among the 1000 most 
common words. 
Specific Testing. Tidy man mentions three kinds of tests: 
the preliminary test, the main test, and the review test, all 
of which should be used. The preliminary test is given 
before the words have been studied. The main test should 
be given in the lesson after the words have been studied, 
and the review tests should be given at later periods. 
This is a good distinction to make in our thinking about 
testing. 
Variations in Standards. A few words may be said in con- 
clusion on the question of how well children should be 
expected to spell. We should like to have perfection in 
spelling, but that is too much to expect in the ordinary 
class. It is apparent at once through a study of the Ayres 
scale that children as a matter of fact do not spell accu- 
rately all the time and how well the average child does, is 
further clear from such a table as this; so that if our children

LEARNING TO SPELL 31 
are about the average we can derive some comfort from 
that fact. However, we know that about two per cent of 
the pupils are chronic bad spellers whose cases are almost 
hopeless. We know further that we should expect erratic 
spelling and that there are wide variations in spelling 
ability, so much so that some fourth-grade children can 
spell better than some of the eighth-grade children. We 
know also that the greatest improvement comes in the 
lower grades. Likewise girls are better spellers than boys: 
it has been found that only one-third of the boys do as well 
as one-half of the girls. Moreover, children whose parents 
were born and educated in foreign countries do not spell as 
well as children whose parents were educated in America. 
So we can say, in general, that while perfection is to be 
desired, the conscientious teacher need not be worried 
about its absence. All that is expected of him is that he 
use the greatest amount of intelligence and persistence of 
which he is capable in his efforts to make the children spell 
as well as possible. 
Summary. Standard tests should be used but the specific test- 
ing of individual pupils in the class is of major importance. Per- 
fection is to be desired but is not to be expected. 
Alternation. By alternation is meant having two grades 
study together and take the work of the one grade one year 
and the work of the other grade the second year. Spelling 
is one of the subjects which can very well be alternated. 
When a special spelling class is taught, the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades can take the same work at the same time. 
The eighth-grade pupils are not so much better than the 
sixth-grade in spelling that they cannot study together if 
care is taken in the selection of words. Spelling should also 
be given a little time in each of several other periods each 
week, and particularly.in the language work when the 
“Black List” may be worked upon.

    CHAPTER II 
HANDWRITING 
1. Subject-Matter 
As a basis for the methods of teaching penmanship the 
school teachers of the nation are very fortunate in having 
access to the work of Professor Freeman, who has gathered 
together in the form of rules all the results of the scientific 
study of penmanship. This material has been drawn 
upon heavily for the content of the chapter. Use is also 
made of the detailed study of methods of teaching pen- 
manship made by Professor Capps at the University of 
Missouri. The Capps material is as yet unpublished. 
Function. There has been a widespread idea that the 
function of subjects was to train the memory, the imagi- 
nation, or the reason. “Why study arithmetic?” some 
one asks. ‘Because it trains one to think clearly,” replies 
the teacher. ‘‘Why study history?” “To train the 
memory.” “Why study handwriting?” “To make one 
neat and accurate.” But did you ever stop to think about 
this — Did the people who invented arithmetic do it to 
get a device for training the reason? Or does the man 
who consults a history use it to train his memory? Or was 
writing invented as a means to neatness and accuracy? 
As a matter of fact, arithmetic was invented, not to train 
the powers of reasoning, but to help men to handle num- 
ber. History was invented, not to train the memory, but 
to give advice and entertainment from the experiences of 
the past, and, in like manner, the function of writing is not to 
give training in neatness but to do something else entirely,
-P-A-G-E-51
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 35 
It is true, of course, that arithmetic does give mental 
training, as do history and penmanship, but that is not 
their real or intrinsic function; it is only a by-product. It 
is not the use for which people are preserving them. It is 
only an indirect purpose about which we have talked a 
great deal in school in the past. Our reason for talking 
about this training or disciplinary function is a long story 
which we cannot tell here. 
The real or intrinsic function of penmanship is to help 
in the communication of ideas that are worth while, by 
providing a set of letters made after a conventional pattern. 
The activities which lie back of handwriting have to do 
with the desire to communicate. For communication there 
are several methods provided. We can communicate 
through oral speech, drawings, hieroglyphs, or words. But 
when we decide to use words, and attempt to give them 
definite form, we write. The function of handwriting is, 
then, to provide us with the forms of the letters in order 
that we may communicate our ideas in writing. A person 
may be a good speller because he knows the correct order 
of letters in words, but at the same time he may be a poor 
writer because he is clumsy and inaccurate in forming the 
letters. So also a child may be good in composition but 
poor in writing, and, as happens not infrequently, excellent 
writers may be poor in spelling or weak in composition. 
Clearly, we should have very little use for handwriting if 
we communicated our ideas only by talking over the 
telephone or speaking face to face, or even if we used a 
typewriter. However, everybody finds it necessary at 
one time or another to communicate his ideas by hand- 
writing because the one to be addressed is not present and 
no typewriter is at hand. 
Summary. The function of handwriting is to assist in the com- 
munication of values by providing correct forms for letters. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 HANDWRITING 
Handwriting Ideals. It has been decided by those who 
have studied good handwriting that it possesses three 
qualities. The most important of these qualities is legi- 
bility. Writing is well done only when the reader can 
easily recognize what the words are and read them rapidly. 
A writer has a social obligation; it is his duty to see that 
the reader does not have to be put to unnecessary effort 
in order to read what is written. In addition to this it is 
highly desirable that the handwriting should be beautiful, 
at least to the extent that it is neat. It is rather clear that 
flourishing handwriting is less legible, and is therefore not 
desirable. Rather the lines should be straight, the letters 
well formed, the spacing should be good, and slant should 
be uniform. From the standpoint of the penman, the 
writing should be rapid, for his life is filled so full of many 
important and interesting things to do that he should not 
have to spend more time than is absolutely necessary in 
writing. He can make this time comparatively short if he 
practices a great deal for speed. However, in seeking to 
save this time he must be particularly careful not to 
endanger the legibility of what he writes. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. The teacher has three major 
objectives in teaching handwriting. In the first place it is 
very important that he develop in the students a liking 
for handwriting. It is not enough that children should 
merely write. It is extremely important that all methods 
possible should be used (as described in the next section) 
to get them to develop pride and interest in their hand- 
writing. In the second place, the teacher should aim to 
set up as ideals in the children the attainment of the three 
qualities mentioned just above. He should use all in- 
centives and methods possible to get them to work for 
speed, for legibility, and for beauty. In the third place, 
the teacher aims for good handwriting, not merely in the
-P-A-G-E-53
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 37 
handwriting class, but in the written letters and themes of 
the pupils which are prepared outside of the formal hand- 
writing period. 
It is possible to have two standards of handwriting. A 
pupil may be jotting notes down rapidly and in such a way 
that he has neither time nor inclination to write legibly. 
He may, for instance, be getting ready to write a paper or 
he may be drafting a solution to an arithmetic problem. 
In such cases, if the writing is not permanent nor intended 
for others to see, the quality of writing does not matter 
greatly, provided the material can be read by the writer. 
But if the writing is to be permanent it must be legible. 
A month later if the pupil has occasion to use it again he 
should be able to read it without loss of effect. If it is to 
be handed to the teacher or read by other pupils it must be 
legible. Politeness demands that the reader be not taxed 
unduly and business sense requires legibility so that mis- 
takes will not occur. Any writing less than No. 9 in the 
Thorndike Scale is dangerous and should not be permitted 
except under protest. However, because of the effect of 
habits formed in note-taking upon permanent writing, 
children should be taught that even in taking notes or 
writing for themselves, they should not grow careless. 
Summary. The good teacher aims to develop a liking for hand- 
writing and to establish standards of legibility, beauty, and 
speed in all written work, but may, within limits, make a distinc- 
tion between standards for note-taking and permanent writing. 
The Elements of Handwriting. At first glance hand- 
writing seems to have to do merely with the looks of the 
writing upon the page; but if we think of it as an activity 
that is carried on by the penman, there are a number of 
other items which should be included in what we call hand- 
writing, and these we shall now mention. . In the first 
place, the position of the body is part of the process of
-P-A-G-E-54
    
38 HANDWRITING 
handwriting and upon this point we have learned a number 
of significant facts. The writer should face the desk 
squarely, because a side position results in spinal curvature 
and eye-strain. Both forearms should rest on the desk for 
approximately three-fourths of their length, to avoid spinal 
curvature. The paper should be directly in front of the 
writer. If it is at one side of the middle line the adjust- 
ment required of the two eyes is different, with resulting 
eye-strain and a twisting of the body which causes spinal 
curvature. The paper should be turned to the left (or to 
the right in the case of the left-handed writer) until the 
lower edge makes an angle of about thirty degrees with 
the edge of the desk, and the writing should slope to the 
right from the vertical by the same amount (or to the left 
in the case of the left-handed writer). The forearm should 
form a right angle with the base of the letters. The hand 
should be placed with the bottom down so that the wrist 
does not slope more than forty-five degrees from the 
horizontal. The hand should rest on the third and fourth 
fingers and not on the side. The forefinger should rest on 
the penholder nearer the penpoint than the thumb. Finally, 
the penholder should be grasped loosely. 
In the second place, the movement of the arm, hand, 
and fingers is part of the process of handwriting. Con- 
cerning the proper movements, we have scientific informa- 
tion. The writing movements should call into play a 
combination of the arm and the four fingers. The arm 
movement is more prominent in the forward progress from 
letter to letter and the finger movement in forming the 
individual letters. The writing movement, particularly 
in the early stages, should be divided into a series of units 
of movement separated by a very slight pause. It is not 
continuous and uniform in speed. The units should corre- 
spond to natural divisions in the form of the letters, which
-P-A-G-E-55
    SUBJECT-MATTER 39 
are usually made by all the upward and downward strokes. 
The result of this is that the writers who are trained to 
divide the writing into units make marked improvement. 
The downward strokes of the letters should be toward the 
body or nearly perpendicular to the edge of the desk. 
This produces a slope in the writing of about thirty de- 
grees. In right-handed writing this causes a forward slant 
and in left-handed writing a backward or backhand slant. 
If the child can readily use his right hand, he should do so. 
If he has a very strong preference for the left hand and 
finds it much more difficult to use the right hand, he 
should be allowed to use the left. 
In the third place, when we come to consider the appear- 
ance of the handwriting on the page, there are five elements 
which are to be taken into account. The spacing between 
the letters and the width of the letters should be uniform 
and in conformity with the system used. The slant should 
be uniform, that is to say, if the stems of the letters are 
extended by long lines they should be parallel. The aline- 
ment of the letters should be even: the single-spaced letters 
should, at their bottoms and tops, touch an imaginary 
straight line drawn across the page. Two-spaced letters 
should be of the same length, as should also be the loops 
of the three-spaced letters. The form of the letters should 
follow the system taught. Finally, the quality of the line 
should be uniform. This means that some parts of the 
letters should not be heavier than others. The pen should 
bear uniformly upon all parts. 
Summary. In handwriting, attention should be paid to seven 
points — position, movement, the forms of letters, spacing, slant, 
alinement, and the quality of the line. 
Handwriting Errors. Penmanship provides one of the 
clearest possible examples of the use of analysis of diffi- 
culties encountered by pupils in learning. Just as in 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    
40 HANDWRITING 
spelling we find that they have much more difficulty with 
some words than with others, so in penmanship when we 
analyze their writing, certain difficulties appear. 
It is important for the teacher to know what these diffi- 
culties are, because they are the points upon which most 
time should be spent. As a matter of fact, there are diffi- 
culties connected with each of the seven factors in hand- 
writing that were mentioned in the last paragraph. The 
position of the pupils may be wrong, and their handwriting 
movement may be incorrect. To illustrate the prevalence 
of errors in form we may cite the case of the class of forty- 
four pupils whose handwriting was diagnosed by Professor 
Capps. He found that in this class thirty-eight pupils

SUBJECT-MATTER 41 
showed faults in alinement and letter forms, while twenty- 
eight had a faulty slant, twenty-five had a poor quality of 
line, and twenty-four made errors in spacing. 
It is evident, of course, from these figures that attention 
needed to be paid to all of these in this particular class, and 
as a matter of fact, such is the case in practically all classes. 
The analysis can be carried further, however, by analyzing 
the faults in connection with each letter. For instance, 
it was found in the class just mentioned, that the above 
were the types of error in the letter “a” in the forty-four 
samples examined. 
Tt will be observed that so far as this particular class is 
concerned, the two chief faults were the looping of the down 
stroke and the leaving open of the top of the letter “a.” 
If the teacher is to approach the subject of handwriting 
in a scientific manner, it is absolutely necessary that such 
analyses of the errors of children be made. The analy- 
sis may not be carried on with scientific detail, but cer- 
tainly the most outstanding errors should be determined. 
Otherwise the teacher will not know where to place the 
emphasis. 
Writing is like keeping one’s health. Most of us know 
a few general health laws and a number of facts about 
colds, measles, etc. By using these we can keep healthy, 
for all practical purposes, without knowing any system of 
medicine or hygiene. But when ill health occurs, it is 
necessary for us to consult a doctor, who by diagnosing 
our case finds out exactly what is wrong and gives specific 
treatment for the trouble. The parallel with writing is 
close. We need to know and practice a few general facts 
about position, movement, and form, but in addition to 
that, we need to make a diagnosis of specific troubles such 
as open-mouthed “a’s,” loop-stemmed “d’s,” ete. These 
special facts deal with those personal penmanship “dis-
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 HANDWRITING 
eases” to which we are peculiarly susceptible. To these 
we need to give specific attention and with them in mind 
we can develop facility in writing a legible hand. 
Summary. The work taken up in the writing drills should be 
dependent upon what the pupils seem to need most urgently. 
The Copy-Book. Copy-books should be used as reference 
books. They show the correct form of the letters. Set 
exercises written in them are useful. In such exercises the 
bottom line should be written first and then the one above, 
so that children will not copy their own mistakes. For the 
reasons given above, copy-books should not, however, be 
the sole means of securing good writing. The best results 
are secured when the pupil’s errors are drilled upon in 
exercises prepared for that purpose. 
Copy-books present handwriting systems of which there 
are a large number, and about whose relative worth there 
has been a great deal of discussion. As a matter of fact, 
however, one system of handwriting is about as good as 
another for practical school purposes. The day for de- 
veloping expert penmen on a large scale is past. There 
was a time before the advent of typewriters when the 
copperplate hand was an important factor in business 
success. But the invention of the typewriter has changed 
this to such an extent that there are very few expert pen- 
men. Consequently the teacher has come to realize that 
children need to develop merely legible handwriting that 
can be written at ordinary speed and with reasonable neat- 
ness. She is not expected to train expert penmen who can 
produce Quality 18 in the Thorndike Scale. She aims 
rather to make reasonably fluent writers whose hand- 
writing approximates to the legibility of Quality 12 or 13 
in the scale. This can be done about as well by one of the 
current systems of handwriting as by another.

2. How to Get Interest 
Immediate Interest. The parallel between spelling and 
handwriting is close. The methods and conditions of 
securing interest are of the same type. We have, first of 
all, the possibility of finding pupils with an immediate 
interest in writing. There are a few such in every school. 
There are also many who like to write but who dislike 
special instruction in writing, and there are a number who 
do not like to write under any conditions. It is these 
latter two classes that furnish the problem of arousing 
interest, since the pupils who are naturally interested in 
writing furnish no problem of motive. 
Mediate Interest. Again referring to our parallel with 
spelling, we find that mediate interest may be secured in 
many ways. We may, for instance, make an appeal to 
generic values. We may say, “Your grade depends upon 
your handwriting. If you do not improve it you will have 
to stay in.” This is a method commonly used, and, of 
course, known to all our readers. But we may, as in 
spelling, make our approach by way of the specific function 
of the subject. In the case of penmanship the function, 
as we said above, is to produce legible characters rapidly. 
So, if the child can be shown that he is being misunderstood 
because he does not write legibly, then if he wants to be 
understood, he will be careful. If he does not care greatly 
about being understood, because he assumes that the 
reader can worry along and get the meaning, the case is 
more difficult. If, however, he gets into a natural difficulty 
because his poor handwriting is misunderstood, he is likely 
to become interested in good writing. 
You may have heard of that Chicago gentleman who 
decided to take his wife to the matinée. After getting the 
tickets he sent a messenger to the house with the message — 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  
44 HANDWRITING 
”   
“T have gotten tickets for the matinée, meet me at 
etc. When he went to meet his wife he found her there 
with eight lady friends. Drawing her aside, he inquired 
the reason for this great generosity and upon reading again 
his note he found that, instead of saying, “I have gotten 
tickets,” etc., he had really written, “I have got ten 
tickets,” etc. Doubtless in the future he was more careful 
about his penmanship. 
The more frequently it can be borne in upon the child 
that his illegible handwriting is handicapping him in telling 
what he wants to tell, the easier it will be to get him to 
work upon his writing. A teacher should have too much 
self-respect to consent to read careless handwriting that is 
hard to read. 
The Writing Hospital. A very satisfactory plan of dealing 
with interest in writing is found in what the children call 
the “writing hospital.” The idea is this: In the sixth to 
eighth grades it is felt that children write poorly either 
because they do not know how to write well or because 
they are careless. Both of these cases are taken care of by 
the hospital in the following manner: If, for any cause, 
a pupil in the class does unsatisfactory writing, he is put 
into a special writing class, while the pupils who have 
reached a satisfactory standard are not required to take 
formal writing practice. The pupil with the unsatisfactory 
writing is put into the class because something is wrong 
with his writing, and he remains there until he has im- 
proved. If his trouble is merely carelessness, a week in 
the class, during which time his more careful classmates 
are at work upon more interesting and attractive material, 
usually cures him. If his trouble is not so much careless- 
ness as inability to write correctly, special attention can 
be given to his errors and to drill upon correct forms. 
The hospital idea can be used in ungraded schools by
-P-A-G-E-61
  
HOW TO GET INTEREST 45 
having all the writing taught in a common class for the two 
upper grades; those who write legibly and with facility do 
not need special drills. Those who are erratic in their 
writing may be assigned to the writing class at any time, 
to remain there until their written work outside of the 
writing class comes up to the required standard. The test 
in each case should be based, not upon the writing done 
in the hospital, but upon the quality of the writing done 
during the day in connection with other subjects. Or, if 
the teacher feels that in the upper grades all the children 
need some drill, he may teach the good and the poor 
writers together twice a week and excuse the better writers 
for the third period, which then becomes the hospital 
class. 
Self-Analysis. One of the very best methods of getting 
interest in handwriting is to lead the children to diagnose 
their own handwriting difficulties, to work upon them, and 
to watch the improvement. This is an excellent method 
because it enlists the cotperation of the children. The 
burden of improvement is placed upon them and they are 
helped in their work because they see that this mysterious 
and seemingly impossible task of improving their hand- 
writing is simplified when they know that they have only 
a half-dozen mistakes which they need to watch carefully. 
This is very well described by Professor Capps, who studied 
with each sixth-grade pupil the errors that he made and 
wrote a list of them. For instance, in the case of Pupil 
No. 17, he found nine errors, as follows: (1) the words were 
crowded together; (2) the alinement ran downward at the 
right side; (3) the lower loops were too long and too large; 
(4) the upper loops and stems did not come up high enough; 
(5) the looped letters had an extreme slant; (6) the “t’s” 
were too tall and were not crossed horizontally; (7) the 
“*r”? was rounded; (8) the “d” was looped at the stem; and  
-P-A-G-E-62
46 HANDWRITING 
(9) the “f” had no top loop. The pupil’s attention having 
been attracted to each of these faults, he was, during a 
period of six months, given exercises to correct them. In 
addition to this, several samples of his writing were taken at 
five times during the year, and the average for the samples 
was worked out with the following results: In October he 
made an average of 8.3 on the Thorndike Scale. In No- 
vember his average was 9, while in January it was 10.3, in 
March 10.1, and in April 10.3. At the same time his speed 
increased from 79 letters a minute to 93. 
It will be noted that he reached his best point between 
October and January. His improvement was quite sig- 
nificant during these four months, for, by reference to the 
standards given later in the chapter, it will be noticed that 
in this time he made improvement equal to that which is 
ordinarily accomplished in quality in two years, and had 
much more than the required eighth-grade speed. 
Other Methods of Getting Interest. In his careful at- 
tempt to use all possible incentives to get children interested 
in handwriting, in the class just mentioned, Professor 
Capps collected seven different methods to supplement the 
self-analysis which was the basis of his course. (1) Through 
the publishers of the system which he used, he secured 
copies of the handwriting of the children of other schools 
in other cities. , These showed the pupils all the difficulties 
that other sietts were able to overcome, and after they had 
examined the material they were told to copy the hand- 
writing specimens and, if possible, to write better than 
the samples. Then when the work of copying was finished, 
the pupils exchanged papers and examined the samples of 
writing to see which was better. (2) Very important was 
the handwriting of the teacher. It is quite clear that unless 
the teacher writes a legible hand it is quite futile for him 
to try to teach children legibility. It is as foolish for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
HOW TO GET INTEREST 47 
careless teacher to scold pupils for carelessness as it is for 
a profane father to whip his boy for swearing. Carelessness 
in writing on the board can never be excused in teachers. 
(3) Displays of the ten best samples of handwriting out of 
the class of forty-four were frequently made on the bulletin 
board. (4) The reasons for good handwriting were dis- 
cussed in class. The children gave all the reasons of 
which they could think while the teacher listed them on 
the blackboard, later to be copied down by the pupils for 
use in the manual which I shall next describe. (5) Pupils’ 
manuals were made. Certain suggestions were made to 
the pupils about the advisability of making a manual of 
their own, which were enthusiastically taken up and added 
to by discussions. These suggestions had to do with their 
preparation of a design done in pen and ink, the description 
of correct position and the inclusion of a few fancy drills 
such as “watch-and-chain,” “fan,” and so on; a de- 
scription of the difficulties in making the small letters with 
directions for remedying them, similar work upon capitals 
—a monthly record of the speed and quality of the writing, 
rules about how to form habits of good handwriting, and a 
list of the values of good penmanship. (6) One of the best 
methods of developing interest was the use of competition. 
The teacher appointed captains, who selected the members 
of their teams and became responsible for them. When 
the pupils were given short sentences to write, the captains 
collected the papers from the members of the teams, and 
checked the words and letters that were most in error while 
the pupils practiced upon these. After this had been done 
for a week, the captains were asked to score the work of 
their teams upon the Thorndike Scale, used in connection 
with short dictated sentences. Then the average for each 
team was calculated after the teacher had checked the 
scores given by the captains. This method was used for 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 HANDWRITING 
a month to develop a great deal of interest. (7) Fancy ex- 
ercises can be used to good advantage in showing the 
children that there is an esthetic element in handwriting. 
By “fancy exercises” are meant those known as “fans,” 
“watches and chains,” “lamps,” “Charlie Chaplin,” and 
soon. These exercises, while often crudely done, cause a 
great deal of interest. 
Summary. In developing interest in handwriting, we can at 
once dismiss those who are naturally fond of handwriting and 
consider only those who have to be induced to like it. This can 
be done by making an appeal to the intrinsic function of hand- 
writing by showing what happens when handyriting is illegible. 
Most important of all is the method of self-analysis and diagnosis 
by which the pupil works upon his own specific difficulties. This 
is particularly valuable when, through tests at regular intervals, 
he can watch his own progress. In intensifying the interest in 
handwriting, the teacher must invariably write well on the black- 
board himself. He may also use such devices as collected samples 
of other children’s handwriting, the preparation of manuals, dis- 
plays of unusually good handwriting, frequent discussion of the 
reasons for good handwriting, fancy exercises, and team com- 
petition. 
3. How to Teach the Technique of Handwriting 
In describing methods of teaching children to write a 
good-looking, legible hand with the requisite speed, it is 
important that attention be directed to the necessity for 
the careful teaching of forms in the lower grades. It fre- 
quently happens that in the effort to get the children 
interested in writing, little instruction is given to the 
children in forming letters. I have frequently noticed 
first-grade children who seemingly have been left to their 
own devices in figuring out how the letters in their names 
are written. For instance, I saw a child who, in forming the 
letter “d,” made the stem first, added the oval next, put 
the first up stroke in as his third step, and the curve from 
the bottom of the stem as his last step. Clearly, lack of
-P-A-G-E-65
  TECHNIQUE OF HANDWRITING 49 
good teaching was evident and the child was destined to 
have a great deal of grief in overcoming these bad habits. 
In the early grades no attention should be paid to speed, 
because all later success is controlled by the ability to make 
the letters accurately. Freeman says that the speed of 
writing should be low at the beginning and showld be 
gradually increased from about thirty letters per minute 
at the end of Grade II to about seventy-three letters per 
minute at the end of Grade VIII. Young children are in- 
capable of making new movements rapidly and even the 
standards of accuracy of letter formation should not be 
too high, and should increase only gradually. 
The letters should be large at the beginning because they 
are easier to make and do not need to be so accurately 
formed as small letters, but the movement in forming the 
letter should be carefully safeguarded. The materials used 
by the primary child in writing should be such as to make 
the task as easy as possible. The first-grade child should 
write with a pencil having soft lead, on unglazed paper. 
The pencil should also be used in the second grade and pen 
and ink should not be introduced until the third grade. 
Correct position and movement should be taught early, 
and persistently followed up throughout the grades. By 
this means a child in the first grade should be expected to 
achieve legibility almost to the degree shown in Sample 
No. 9 in the Thorndike Scale. By that time the child has 
learned how to form the letters, has been taught the correct 
position, and has practiced upon the proper movement. 
In the case of individual children, considerable variation 
should be allowed from the position and movement which 
was outlined earlier in this chapter. Children differ in size, 
and the height of the desks is not always exactly adjusted. 
Diagnosis. From this time on, diagnosis and self-analysis 
can be used with increasing value. As has been stated so 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 HANDWRITING 
frequently in this chapter, the children and the teacher 
should both study the errors in order to pay particular 
attention to them. It will be necessary for the teacher 
to analyze the handwriting of the children as a class to 
find the points which the general class exercises should 
stress, and in addition to make a diagnosis of the specific 
difficulties of each child. These, then, are put before the 
children as specifications of the points to which they are 
to pay particular attention. 
Such a method of studying handwriting naturally leads 
to individual instruction. It is not enough for the teacher 
to dictate sentences which the children are to write. He 
must circulate among the children in the writing exercises 
and call attention to the mistakes which individual children 
are making. Outside of the writing class it is important 
that, from time to time, the children’s errors should be 
called to their attention. Both in the class and outside, 
the individual child can be given specific exercises to 
correct his specific faults. Nor does this take a greater 
amount of time. The teacher does not need to overburden 
himself with individual instruction, but he does need to 
have the scientific attitude and he must be alert in handling 
his class. The point of importance is not quantity of in- 
struction so much as the quality of the teaching. The 
lazy or dull teacher will not be interested in doing more 
than carrying through set assignments. The industrious 
and intelligent teacher tries to spend his time to the best 
advantage during the hours of his teaching. 
Attentive Repetition. There are two ways in which the 
child practices handwriting. One is to go through the 
exercises time after time without paying much attention 
to what he is doing. This is mere repetition and is very 
wasteful of time. In order that practice may be most 
valuable, attentive repetition is necessary. The child’s at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
TECHNIQUE OF HANDWRITING 51 
tention should, as far as possible, be kept upon what he is 
writing and upon making the forms correctly and speedily. 
For this reason it is not advisable to have a handwriting 
drill period of more than ten, or at the outside, fifteen 
minutes. Short, quick, and intense drills will actually 
accomplish more than longer periods of practice. In 
carrying on the drill exercises it has been found that count- 
ing is a useful temporary device. Particularly is it good 
when the counting is used to group the movements into 
units by the pauses between the units. The orders and 
instructions should be clear and pointed so that no doubt 
is left in the pupils’ minds as to what is to be done. All 
class mechanics should be as simple as possible with the 
object of giving the most practice in the shortest time. 
If there is ten minutes allowed for the writing drill, as little 
time as possible should be spent in getting ready the ma- 
terial and putting it away; while the drill is on, every 
minute should be utilized. 
When children work for speed they sometimes lose in 
quality. At other times the quality of handwriting can be 
improved by making a fluent penman write more slowly. 
There is a danger, in other words, of the pupil’s writing too 
rapidly; consequently speed and accuracy have to run 
hand in hand. There is no virtue in having all the pupils 
unusually fast writers. They may write too rapidly. Un- 
usual speed should always be checked up with quality. 
But, on the other hand, a poor quality of handwriting may 
be improved by an increase in speed. Every case must be 
decided upon its own merits, the desirable objective being 
that the pupil should have both high quality and great 
speed. Of the two, however, quality is the control factor 
and should never be sacrificed to fluency. When the 
student’s speed is graphed, a fall of the line may be more 
desirable than a rise.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  52 HANDWRITING 
Standards of achievement should be set up for each 
grade and these will be mentioned in the next section, 
These standards should be set before the pupil, and his 
own writing should be measured in the same terms, in 
order that he may trace his progress in relation to the 
standard. Records should also be kept and the pupil’s 
analysis of the form of his writing should be directed along 
the lines of the record, some of which are given in the next 
section of this chapter. The use of a chart to show by lines 
how he is progressing has been found to be valuable. 
Writing Projects. Handwriting is related to the project 
idea in two ways. In the first place, penmanship is used 
in connection with many other projects, as, for instance, 
in hygiene projects where the child has to do some writing. 
In this case we do not speak of it as a writing project. 
There is, however, one very definite type of writing 
project. This has already been illustrated in other terms 
in the foregoing discussion in this chapter. Bearing in 
mind the fact that the project has two general character- 
istics, namely, that the work makes the pupils think, and 
that it is carried on in its natural setting, we see at once 
that when the pupils use self-analysis and work upon the 
correction of their own mistakes in order to improve the 
quality of their work through practice, we use the project. 
The purpose of the child is to improve his handwriting, 
which we teach him to feel is worth while. He uses the 
process of reasoning by finding out what his difficulties are 
and by discovering methods of correcting them. He tries 
out the methods and watches his progress to discover 
whether the methods work or not. So, because he is 
studying under natural conditions and using his brains 
rather than just going through the motions, we feel justified 
in speaking of the method of self-analysis as a writing 
project.
-P-A-G-E-69
TECHNIQUE OF HANDWRITING 53 
Summary. In teaching handwriting, it is important that in the 
early grades more attention should be paid to accuracy in the 
formation of letters and to instruction in correct position and 
movement. We realize also that the project method, which is 
based upon self-analysis and the correction of specific mistakes, 
is quite worth while. But this must be supplemented by directed 
drill and intelligent practice carried on for short periods of time 
* go as to secure the fullest possible degree of attention on the part 
of the pupils. 
Scales. In order that children may intelligently learn 
how well they write, it is necessary that the teacher make 
a part of his regular equipment some of the handwriting 
scales which have been devised. One of these — the 
Thorndike Scale — is included in the text. Practice on 
the part of the teacher is necessary in the use of all of the 
scales, but once this has been secured, they are reasonably 
accurate means of measuring improvement. Another easily 
used scale is that known as the Ayres Scale, and a third is 
the Freeman set of scales, which measure separately the 
forms of letters, alinement, slant, spacing, and quality of 
line. These scales may be obtained through the super- 
intendent of schools, who in turn may obtain them from 
the state university or teachers’ college, and if they do not 
have them, from the following sources: 
The Thorndike Handwriting Scale, Teachers College, Columbia 
University, New York, N.Y. 
ae a Scale, The Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 
The Freeman Scales, University Press, University of Chicago, 
Chicago, Ill. 
Standards. The following approximate standards of ad- 
vancement for each grade, which are based on the median 
score for a large number of children, are presented. This 
means that the “average” or “median” of the class of a 
grade should be equal to these. It does not mean, how- 
ever, that no pupil should not be expected to do better 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  54 HANDWRITING 
than these scores, since the scores mean that one-half of 
the children upon whose performance the standard is based 
made a better score than the median and that one-half of 
them made a poorer. That is what the median means. 
It is important in using these standards to explain to care- 
less pupils who can write much better than these medians 
that they should not be satisfied with their work if they 
wish to do as well as the pupils from whom the standards 
were made. The standards are chiefly of use to the teacher 
in judging of the ability of her class as a whole rather than 
as to the ability of the individual members of the class. 
The standards, after Freeman, are as follows. This means 
that in Grade II children who have a speed of thirty letters 
a minute should possess a quality of handwriting of thirty- 
five on the Ayres Scale, of 8.5 on the Thorndike Scale, and 
of eleven on the Freeman Scale.

Records. Simple records showing the proficiency of each 
child from month to month can easily be made, and if 
these records are squared off it is possible to make a graph 
of them. This can be done for both speed and accuracy. 
For instance, a record showing speed and quality may be 
made as follows. Along the left-hand side of the speed 
record are given the number of letters per minute and along

A black line indicates the norm or standard for the grade. 
A similar chart or record may be made for one of the scales, 
where the quality can be indicated along the left-hand side 
and the time of the test placed at the top. By joining the 
points on these scales a graph is made for an individual 
pupil. It is quite useful to have the children prepare their 
own graphs. Two graphs for the sixth-grade pupil quoted 
earlier in the chapter are given as illustrations. 
Conducting a Test. We are indebted to Professor Free- 
man for the following directions for conducting a hand- 
writing test and scoring the papers. 
1. Give the pupils some preliminary practice in writing the 
words which they will write in the test so that they can write 
them freely from memory. In the second and third grades 
use some suitable rhyme, as: 
“The rain is raining all around, 
It falls on field and tree, 
It rains on the umbrellas here, 
And on the ships at sea.” 
In the fourth to the eighth grades use the names of the 
numerals (not the figures), one, two, three, etc., practicing up 
to thirty. 
2. Be provided with a stop watch, or a watch with a second hand. 
8. See that the pupils are ready with pen and ink (or pencil in 
the grades in which pens have not been used) and paper. 
4. Instruct the pupils substantially as follows: 
“ We are to have a test (or game) to see how well you can 
write. To write well means to write rapidly and also to 
make it look well. We are going to write what we have 
been practicing (make sure the pupils know what this is). 
You will start when I say ‘Begin’ and stop when I say 
‘Stop.’ Be sure to keep writing all the time till I say ‘ Stop.” 
(If this is the first test, give a trial or two in starting and 
stopping on other paper than that which is prepared for the 
test.) Remember, write well and rapidly and keep on writ- 
ing until I say ‘ Stop.’” i 
5. See that everybody is ready, start the watch, or wait till the 
second hand is at zero, and say “Begin.”
-P-A-G-E-74
  58 HANDWRITING 
6. Keep watch of the pupils and start going again any that may 
stop. 
7. Note the watch carefully and say “Stop” exactly at the end 
of two minutes. 
8. Glance about and stop any pupils that may continue. 
Scoring the Papers. The speed may be quickly and ac- 
curately scored by the following procedure: 
1. Make a scoring copy by writing out the text and placing 
above each word the number of the letters in the text up to 
the end of that word. 
2. Note the last letter the pupil has written and give him pro- 
visionally the corresponding score by referring to the scoring 
copy. 
8. Read through the pupil’s copy to see that it is correctly 
written and add or deduct any letters he has inserted or left 
out. 
4. Divide by two in order to get the score in terms of letters per 
minute. 
The form may be scored by following the directions 
which accompany the scale which is used. In general, 
some practice is needed before scoring can be done accu- 
rately. 
Summary. The teacher should make definite and constant use 
of some one of the handwriting scales. The merit of a class should 
be judged by reference to established standards and records should 
be kept with regularity. All of these should be known to the 
pupils and should be used by them. 
Alternation. The four upper grades may have a com- 
mon writing period. It may or may not be in “hospital” 
form. But in any case the errors in writing are so common 
that the exercises given to the eighth grade are just the 
same as those given to the fifth. As a matter of fact, the 
fifth-grade pupils write, on the average, a better hand than 
eighth-grade pupils. So all the upper grades may have 
the same writing periods and exercises. In the lower 
grades the work should all be incidental to the composition 
classes and to the other classes that use written work, and
-P-A-G-E-75

occasion should be taken in every class to teach correct 
form of both letters and movement. But in both upper 
and lower grades the writing battle is won or lost outside 
the special writing class, not inside.

CLASS QUESTIONS 
1. Take up two of the common systems of writing and compare in the 
following particulars: (a) slant, (6) forms of letters, (c) beauty, 
(d) position of pen, (e) position of body, and (f) kind of arm move- 
ment. 
2. If you were to change the system of penmanship in the school, would 
you make it in all the grades at once or would you spread the change 
over eight years, beginning in the first grade? 
8. Take the natural handwriting in ink of twenty-five pupils and grade 
them by the Thorndike standards. Grade them three or four times 
without letting yourself compare your gradings till afterward. How 
closely do your gradings agree in each case? 
4. As a class exercise, have other members grade to see how closely 
they agree with you. (As a matter of common practice, do stock 
judges or corn judges agree?) How would you arrive at the true 
rating of the specimens? 
5. Diagnose your own handwriting and state what you need to do to 
improve it. 
As you sit at the desk now provided for you, what is the natural 
angle for your paper to lie at? ~When writing at your table at home,

CHAPTER III 
LANGUAGE 
1. Subject-Matter 
The Function of Language. The intrinsic function of lan- 
guage, the purpose for which it was created, is to com- 
municate ideas (1) through words (2) with accuracy and 
effectiveness (3) to an audience. 
Language, in the elementary school, is, broadly speaking, 
made up of a group of subjects, including spelling, writing, 
composition, and grammar. But each of these serves only 
a secondary purpose in connection with language, for while 
they all assist in the verbal communication of ideas, at the 
same time each has a special function. Writing takes care 
of the forms of letters, spelling attends to the order of letters 
in a word, punctuation indicates breaks in the expression of 
ideas by means of periods, commas, and so on, while 
grammar deals with the relation of words in the sentence. 
Language is, therefore, a comprehensive term which in- 
cludes all these subdivisions and which serves as the 
medium through which these others may contribute to 
accurate and effective speech. 
Language is, of course, only one medium for the ex- 
pression of ideas — it uses words. But there are media 
other than words. Painting uses color and line as its 
medium, sculpture uses marble, music uses sound, and 
carpentry uses wood. Language deals only with com- 
munication of ideas through words. 
In the communication of ideas through words there is 
a difference between effectiveness and accuracy. Of two  
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 LANGUAGE 
expressions which are equally accurate, one may be very 
much more effective than the other. Two writers may be 
equally accurate in expressing the same idea, but their 
ability to state this idea in forceful form may differ widely. 
This is clearly illustrated in the sentence, “Babylon is 
fallen.” This is grammatically correct, but by a slight 
rearrangement of the words we have a very much more 
effective statement in “Fallen, fallen, is Babylon!” Lan- 
guage study is concerned, of course, with both accurate 
expression and effective expression. 
The idea that language must be effective leads us nat- 
urally to the audience. We never talk except to people. 
Speech was developed in order to permit the communication 
of ideas. If we think we have nothing of importance to 
say on a subject, we say nothing. If the audience already 
knows as much about a subject as we do and we realize 
this, we keep silent. It is impossible to develop ability in 
language without taking account of the people to whom 
we talk and for whom we write. How to make the child 
conscious of his audience, the methods of getting him to 
love to write and talk to people, are problems that will be 
taken up not only in this chapter but in several succeeding 
chapters where the personal element enters deeply into the 
teaching of a subject. 
Summary. The function of language study is to assist the pupils 
to communicate their ideas, through words, to an audience, with 
accuracy and effectiveness. 
Ideals. In the teaching of language there are a few ideals 
by which we measure effectiveness. Clearly, the student 
should be interested in, and strive to obtain, accuracy in 
the use of grammatical and rhetorical forms. There should 
also be developed in him something of feeling for beauty and 
artistic polish, within the limits of his youthful ability to 
appreciate and perform. Forcefulness of expression, in-
-P-A-G-E-79
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 63 
cluding something more than clarity, is a trait which good 
speakers and conversationalists possess. I think, also, 
that children should have the ideal of service which ex- 
presses itself in the form of a desire to be kindly and help- 
ful. So much is lost in our conversational contacts with 
people because the personal element is absent and there is 
no desire on the part of either to be of service to the other. 
Finally, the quality of getting other people’s point of view is 
of prime importance in language. So much argument is 
carried on because people do not whderstand each other’s 
point of view. Most arguments would disappear if each 
side would recognize that there must be something in the 
other person’s position or he would not hold it. Our in- 
stinctive tendency is to say that he is all wrong, utterly 
foolish, or that he cannot be telling the truth. As a matter 
of fact, people very seldom are completely wrong or foolish. 
Their point of view looks reasonable to them and perhaps 
it is just as reasonable as ours. If we can find out what the 
‘other man is driving at, and why he takes the position that 
he does, half the battle of effective English has been fought 
and won, because when we see his point of view we can fit our 
language to it so as more easily to show him how our point 
of view differs from his and in what respects it is similar. 
Summary. Certain ideals need to be developed in connection 
with language study. Some of the most important of these are 
accuracy, artistic quality and beauty, forcefulness, desire for serv- 
ice, and sensitiveness to the other person’s point of view. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. (1) One of the most im- 
portant objectives of the teacher in language work is the 
development of a love for oral and written composition. 
If the children do not like it, they will never learn very 
much. They will go through the forms and miss the sub- 
stance. They will merely joke about their mistakes and 
smile at their ineffectiveness because they have no respect  
-P-A-G-E-80
  
64 LANGUAGE 
for language. (2) In the second place, the teacher needs 
to lay stress upon the accuracy of oral and written speech. 
To this end he must know what the errors are, and the cor- 
rectives for them. He must insist upon the undeviating 
use of correct forms. (3) A third objective of the teacher 
is the development in the children of effectiveness of ex- 
pression. Enunciation, quality of voice, tone, and posture 
of the body all enter into the element of effectiveness, along 
with self-confidence and positiveness of personal conviction. 
(4) Obviously regard for artistic expression should be de- 
veloped within the limits of the children’s ability. The 
teacher certainly should require neatness, which is one of 
the most elementary of esthetic requirements. (5) One 
of the most important objectives of the teacher is the 
developing in the child of a consciousness of his audience. 
(6) The educational research of the past ten years is laying 
more and more stress upon the fact that the teacher should 
throw the burden of their improvement upon the shoulders 
of the pupils themselves. The teacher may feel that it 
is his duty to correct the English of the pupils and that he 
has a group of recalcitrant youngsters who do not wish to 
beimproved. If that is the situation itis hopeless. He can 
help them to improve only when they want to improve and 
if they want to improve themselves they will take the re- 
sponsibility for doing so. Consequently his job becomes 
that of helping them in their English by helping them to 
help themselves. 
Summary. The outstanding objectives of the teacher are these: 
To develop a love for English composition; to develop accuracy 
and effectiveness of expression; to develop regard for artistic 
form; to develop in the children the consciousness of an audience. 
In doing all of this he throws the burden of improvement upon 
the pupils.

The study of both of these lists will be very instructive 
because they show what adults feel that they need when 
they have left school and are working in a vocation. 
Diagnosis. In determining what should be included in 
the course of study in language, we necessarily fall back 
upon an analysis of the weaknesses that people show in 
defective speech. Children pick up from their parents a 
large number of ways of expressing their ideas through 
words. If this expression were completely satisfactory we 
would need to pay no attention whatever to language, for 
we attend only to the things that give us difficulty, or have, 
in the past, given us difficulty. The ordinary man knows 
very little about cytosis or the action of white blood cor- 
puscles upon germs. He does know a good deal about the 
cause of indigestion. The reason for this is that he has 
indigestion every once in a while and so needs to pay 
attention to it. 
Even so, in language there are simple elements that 
influence the effectiveness of speech to which we pay no 
attention because over them we have reasonable control. 
We single out for attention only the deficiencies. 
The result of this is shown in two forms. One is the 
error list. The other is the body of rules and directions 
for effective expression, such as rules of punctuation, capi- 
talization, and the principles of unity, coherence, etc. 
It may be claimed that in language work we should pay 
attention to something else besides mistakes. But that is 
impossible except for momentary pauses to appreciate how 
cleverly and successfully we have overcome certain de- 
ficiencies which we formerly had. The rules, directions, 
and principles of English composition were really derived 
after very excellent literature, judged on the basis of 
effectiveness, was contrasted with very ineffective liter- 
ature, and the differences were stated in the form of rules

or principles. No one ever learns an art except upon the 
basis of attention to those points at which he falls down. 
Errors. Analyses of the mistakes of oral language have 
been made in many cities, and these mistakes have proved 
to be classifiable around about thirty major items, such as 
confusion of the past tense and the perfect participle, the 
use of double negatives, etc. For the information of the 
reader, a table showing in terms of percentage the distri- 
bution of oral errors found in four cities is given on the pre- 
ceding page. 
It will be noted from this table that the most common 
type of error is the confusion of the past tense with the 
participle, as in seen, saw, did, done, ete. It will also be 
noted that the next three groups, from the standpoint of 
frequency of occurrence, include a large number of cases. 
These are: failure of the verb to agree with the subject in 
number; as, “he don’t”; double negatives, as, “I don’t 
have none”; and syntactical redundance, as, “John, he is 
going to lead.” 
The relative frequency of grammatical errors does not 
vary very widely in different localities in so far as the 
most frequent, at least, are concerned, so that what holds 
on a national scale holds very well for the individual 
school. 
Therefore the accompanying twenty-three most common 
errors made in Pittsburgh are of interest to teachers no 
matter where they teach. Out of the 25,676 errors which 
were collected, the mistakes in the following list occurred 
more than two hundred times.

It was found in Boise that 40 per cent of all language 
errors were made in verbs, that 20 per cent were errors in 
pronunciation, 17 per cent in pronouns, 12 per cent in col- 
loquial expression, 6 per cent in adverbs, and 3 per cent in 
double negatives. In Kansas City, when the oral gram- 
matical errors were classified, it was found that 24 per cent 
of all were made through the confusion of the past tense 
and the participle, that of these over 30 per cent arose from 
a confusion of seen and saw, and that the inability to use 
did and done, and come and: came ranked next in frequency. 
It was discovered also that approximately 50 per cent of 
the errors were in verbs. Double negatives accounted for 11 
per cent, 10 per cent of the errors were made in pronuncia- 
tion, and about 8 per cent in syntactical redundance. That 
is to say, if children can use verbs and pronouns accurately 
and avoid double negatives, they will avoid about three 
out of four of the grammatical errors in oral speech. 
The reader may be interested in seeing the specific verbs 
that give the greatest amount of difficulty. In Boise, out  
-P-A-G-E-86
    70 LANGUAGE 
of all the verbs collected they found see mentioned in 
17 per cent of the cases, do in 15 per cent, come in 10 per 
cent, go in 10 per cent, run in 6 per cent, sit-set in 5 
per cent, lie-lay in 4 per cent, give in 4 per cent, begin in 4 
per cent, ring in 3 per cent, write in 3 per cent, take in 
2 per cent, break in 2 per cent, and a miscellaneous group 
which accounted for the remaining 15 per cent. 
In addition to these errors in grammatical form there 
are errors in punctuation, capitalization, oral speech, and 
written form, in such matters of rhetoric as the principles 
of unity, coherence and emphasis, and in those of narration, 
description, exposition and argument. 
As a matter of fact, if we follow the rules we shall avoid 
the errors, but we cannot follow the rules as if they were 
of equal importance because some errors are more frequent 
than others and should receive more attention. Not only 
are they more frequent, but they are more difficult to 
correct and for that reason, also, they require more atten- 
tion. Which of these should receive the greatest attention 
is determined by individual class diagnosis. The teacher 
should make a speech survey so as to know the things to 
which he needs to pay the greatest amount of attention in 
the class which he is teaching. This may vary little or 
much from class to class, depending upon the class. Be- 
cause we cannot foretell what the variation will be, it is 
necessary that the preliminary survey be made as a routine 
part of the teacher’s method of instruction. 
Summary. The common errors of speech have been listed antl 
should be used as a basis for instruction. But, in addition, a 
language survey of the school should be made at the beginning of 
each year to discover the points which should receive greatest 
emphasis. 
The Course of Study. The course of study in language 
is much more definite than the course of study in arith-
-P-A-G-E-87
    
SUBJECT-MATTER 71 
metic. We have a handful of rules and principles which 
need to be taught, and a group of specific errors of speech 
which need to be directly attacked. There are approxi- 
mately sixty rules which need to be taught in the grades 
and about seventy-five incorrect language forms which 
constitute the basis for corrective work. This is all that 
has to be taught in eight years in the grades or in twelve 
years, including the high school, or in sixteen years includ- 
ing college. The facts to be taught are very simple. The 
proposition is entirely one of setting up correct habits of 
speech so strong and vital that they will dominate the in- 
correct habits which the student acquires before he comes 
to school or learns outside the schoolroom or even in the 
schoolroom itself. The course of study, then, as revealed 
in the textbooks, which seem to be so largely a hit-or-miss 
collection of lessons on literature, of plays, games, personal 
experiences, etc., is based upon this foundation which has 
just been mentioned — the 135 elements of correct speech. 
In giving the wide variety of content to language books, the 
authors are seeking to give new forms of drill and practice 
on these 135 points. The correct use of seen and saw may 
come up in a number of different lessons, such as repro- 
duction lessons, lessons based on literature or on pictures, 
and in debating or story-telling. The seeming lack of 
organization of the course of study in language is not real 
if the authors have done their duty conscientiously. 
Textbooks. The teacher, in introducing language facts, 
should not feel bound to follow the order of lessons in the 
textbook. His first duty is to make a language survey and 
learn the points which give the children trouble. He should 
decide upon the order in which he will treat these points 
and should then use the language textbook for instructional 
material. If the book has a checking list consisting of all 
the rules that have been taught, the teacher should be very
-P-A-G-E-88
    72 LANGUAGE 
familiar with it and use it constantly. If the difficulty to 
be treated is the confusion of seen and saw, the lessons in the 
book that deal with it can be used as the basis for practice. 
In general, the inexperienced teacher will follow the order 
of material in the text until he can feel his way and decide 
upon an order which is better, in the light of the needs of 
his own class. 
It is impossible for the writer of any textbook to take up 
points in the exact order that will prove the most satis- 
factory for an individual class. He has built a textbook 
to be used in all forty-eight States in the Union, and the 
best that he can do is to present some sort of organization 
which has worked in certain specific cases, but the pub- 
lishers would be foolish to claim that his order will hold for 
every class in every school. That is to say, the course of 
study in language and grammar should be psychological 
rather than logical. It is not necessary to teach points in 
logical sequence; they should be taken up at the psycho- 
logical moment when they seem to fit best into the class- 
work. 
Standards. The standard by which to judge language 
form is simple to state. A legible letter, essay, or theme, 
correctly spelled, properly punctuated, grammatically cor- 
rect, with easy flowing sentences containing as much 
brightness as may be thrown in, is sufficient for all school 
purposes. It is very evident to me that no direct attempt 
should be made to secure the polished literary form of 
great artists. It is sufficient to have school children write 
essays and themes with legibility and in conformity to the 
tules of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. A good, 
clear letter is all that is necessary. The standard for oral 
language is the same, except that in oral language no 
attention is paid to spelling and writing. 
Form in both written and oral composition is to be
-P-A-G-E-89
  SUBJECT-MATTER 73 
judged in the grades, as in life, by the work done outside 
the language class. The form of arithmetic exercises, 
physiology notes, geography and history reports, and per- 
sonal letters, determines quality. If this is poor it makes 
little difference what sort of work is done in the language 
class. 
Teachers complain of two difficulties. One group of 
teachers says that the composition work of the children is 
very slovenly. Another group says that when children 
pay too much attention to writing, spelling, etc., they 
become stilted and stiff in what they write or talk about. 
In dealing with these two criticisms a double standard 
will solve many problems. The teacher may allow two 
standards in written work. I find that most people who 
write anything important need to make at least a first draft 
and a final draft. Sometimes it is necessary to make two 
or three additional drafts in between the first and the last. 
The first draft is usually very rough. It is dashed off in the 
heat of the idea. It is not the kind of work that one would 
wish to be judged by. The final draft, if one is neat and 
considerate, looks very different. It is worked out with 
due attention to form. 
The first criticism — that the pupils’ work is slovenly — 
arises from the failure of the teacher to require a final 
draft, legible, readable, and neat in form. The teacher 
accepts the first draft and complains of slovenliness instead 
of requiring a legible draft. The second criticism — that 
the pupils are stilted and formal — arises from the failure 
of the teacher to allow the pupils time for, or to teach them 
the methods of, making a first draft. Then, clearly, when 
the pupils have to write very legibly, and in fact have to 
stop to make corrections, all the time fearing that they 
may make some mistake, they will write as stiltedly as a 
young man talks when he visits very precise people in un-
-P-A-G-E-90
  4 LANGUAGE 
usual surroundings and fears with every word he says that 
he will make some bad mistake. If the teacher will show 
the pupils how to make two drafts, allowing natural work 
in the first and requiring careful revision in the second, the 
content will be more spontaneous and at the same time the 
form will be careful and legible. 
Standard Tests. As in spelling and handwriting, so in 
language we have a number of standard tests. Efforts have 
been made to devise a scale for grading written compo- 
sitions. As you know, it is difficult to know exactly what 
grade, in terms of percentage or rank, should be given to a 
composition, so Hillegas, Willing, Ballou and others have 
worked out scales which run substantially as follows: 
They collect a large number of compositions in, let us say, 
narration, and ask a large number of judges to rank, in- 
dividually, these compositions in what each thinks is the 
order of merit, from the best to the poorest. The judgment 
of all these people is pooled and a sort of average is run 
out. Then a sample of the very best, the very poorest, and. 
of a number in between the best and poorest, selected at 
regular intervals, are drawn out and arranged in order in 
the scale. For instance, Willing has a sample that is 
worth 90, another that is worth 80, another worth 70, and 
so on down to 20. 
The idea is that a teacher may take the compositions of 
his class and, after reading each, decide which one of the 
stories in the scale it is most nearly like, with the object of 
giving it that grade. 
These composition scales are interesting to study and 
are of value to the teacher, but a great deal of work has yet 
to be done in this very difficult field before we can hope to 
have thorough-going standard scales for composition. 
I have developed some diagnostic language tests which 
were based upon the study of approximately 100,000 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
SUBJECT-MATTER 15 
errors made by children in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, 
Minnesota, Idaho, Missouri, and Texas; there are three of 
these tests, one on pronouns, one on verbs, and a mis- 
cellaneous test. The object of the tests is to find out 
whether children are able to recognize the mistakes which 
they most commonly make. These tests take the following 
form. The children are given a number of sentences and 
are told that some are correct and some are incorrect. 
They are then asked to check those that are correct and 
correct the errors in the others. While I may be accused 
of prejudice in favor of these tests because I happen to have 
made them, it seems to me that these, or others like them, 
are of very great value to teachers in making language 
surveys, because they show with great definiteness which 
of the common mistakes children fail to recognize and those 
which they handle with considerable skill. 
Tests have also been made for punctuation and for 
accuracy, in copying. Starch’s Punctuation Scale is an 
example of the former and the Boston test is an example of 
a test for the latter. In the Boston test it was found, after 
having been given to 4494 pupils in the ninth grade, that 
each pupil made an average of five and one-half errors in 
the test and that these were distributed as follows:

It will be understood that in this test the children were 
each given a printed selection containing about fifteen 
lines and were asked to copy it in handwriting. So these
-P-A-G-E-92
  16 LANGUAGE 
are the mistakes that were made by children in copying 
when they had the material to be copied right in front of 
them. It is probable that while these pupils seem to make 
a large number of mistakes they are somewhat above the 
average in accuracy in copying. 
2. Interest 
Our problem in language study is that of getting the 
children interested in language forms — grammatical facts, 
thetorical rules, and information about punctuation. 
Basis of Interest. Leading to the discussion of methods 
of doing this, there are three facts that throw much light 
upon the subject. These are the following. We show 
interest in conversation (or writing): first, when we are 
interested in the topic of conversation; second, when our 
audience is interested in it; and third, when our hearers 
do not know as much about it as we do. On the other 
hand, we are not interested in conversation if we are not 
interested in the topic, if our audience seems to be bored, 
or if those to whom we are talking know much more about 
it than we do. 
A few illustrations will make this important point clearer. 
Last summer three friends of mine went to Sedalia and 
while there heard a piece of gossip about a citizen of our 
town. 
A, When they returned, two of them rushed into my 
office on some pretext, to tell me the news. I had not 
heard it and proved an appreciative listener. Here were 
all the conditions necessary for a freely flowing tongue, 
and my friends rose to the situation. 
B. After they left, another of my friends happened in, 
and I started to tell him the story; but he was so worried 
about something else that I could not get his attention — 
my audience was not sympathetic; so I dropped the sub-
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  INTEREST 17 
ject and began to talk about another matter. I didn’t see 
any use in wasting words on him when he was not inter- 
ested. 
C. In the course of a few minutes another mutual friend 
dropped in, and I proceeded to tell him the interesting 
episode. He said, “Yes, that certainly is great; Tom just 
told me about it.” So again I dropped my story because 
I do not enjoy telling people things they already know. 
D. Now, it so happened that there was one item in the 
story that was not clear to me, and a little later, as I 
chanced to see the third of the friends who had gone to 
Sedalia, I asked him to tell me about it. His answer was 
short and to the point, “You know I haven’t any use for 
that fellow, and I didn’t pay any attention to the story.” 
So he stopped talking. 
Here in this one illustration, we have all the three factors 
of interest. 
In school language work frequently not only one but all 
of these factors are missing. The first case I shall mention 
isa very common one. ‘The fifth class has just had a lesson 
on the artist Millet, and as a composition exercise the class 
is asked to write out the substance of the lesson. It so 
happens that this lesson is not interesting to any one in the 
class. Here we have a case in which a boy writes a theme 
on a subject in which he is not interested, also writes it for 
an audience (the class, or the teacher) that is not interested 
and that already knows as much about it as he does. Out 
of school the story of Millet would not be the subject of 
the pupils’ conversation. In the schoolroom the pupils 
are compelled to write about it. It is, therefore, no wonder 
that the written work and the oral work in schools is so 
monotonously poor. The children’s hearts are not in their 
subjects. The chief reason why normal children hate 
language work is that some one of these factors of interest
-P-A-G-E-94
  73 LANGUAGE 
is absent. If they are all present, children can no more 
help growing in language than a flower with plenty of 
water, soil, and sunshine can help putting forth buds and 
leaves. 
Summary. In order to secure interest in composition work it 
is necessary that pupils have something interesting to talk about, 
and an interested audience not already possessed of as much in- 
formation on the subject under discussion as is the writer or 
speaker. 
Topics of Interest. The first important consideration is 
to get topics of interest to the pupils. There are many of 
these, but of one sort in particular I wish to speak first. 
Most language facts should be taught incidentally in the 
grades, in rural schools. Taught incidentally, the interest 
will depend upon the attractiveness of the other subjects 
and the way in which they are handled. If they are in- 
terested in history and geography, there is one of three 
factors present. Very often the other two can be handled 
by a little ingenuity on the part of the teacher. For in- 
stance, instead of asking a pupil merely to reproduce on 
paper the story of The Man Without a Country after it has 
been read, much better results will come through a slight 
recasting of the assignment to this form, perhaps: “Was the 
punishment of Nolan too hard? Why?” or, “Were the 
officers and sailors sorry for him? What makes you think 
so? Did they think his punishment was too hard? What 
makes you think so?” Here, by a slight shifting of the 
phrasing, the teacher can change a dry assignment into a 
living problem. It then fulfills all three conditions of in- 
terest — a topic of interest to the pupil, one in which he 
thinks his audience will be interested, and one in which, 
since he makes up his own mind as he goes along, he will 
feel that his audience does not know all the facts. As a 
result he feels that the questions are worth discussing. In
-P-A-G-E-95
INTEREST 73 
history and geography this same ingenuity produces slight 
changes that transform dead topics into living questions. 
It is a quality in teachers that is partly native and partly 
acquired. Newspaper men must have it, because they have 
to take dry facts and, by viewing them at a different angle, 
translate them into living news. When the reporter hands 
in a prosy story, the editor, by a slight but subtle and 
skillful touch, changes it so that it excites interest. He 
does it, not by telling an untruth about fact, but by giving 
fact an interesting turn. 
For the teacher this is most important, because in every 
subject it makes the difference between prosy and living 
recitations. There is only one way to get it, and that is 
by working for it. Directions are not availing. One has 
to work for the expression — the question and the turn 
that will do the work. 
Other Examples. Besides pleasing and vital problems, 
there are a number of topics that lend interest to language 
classes. One can, with little children, get much interest 
for some time through letter writing. There is a fas- 
cination about putting on paper ideas that another at a 
distance can read, which is particularly thrilling to young 
children. If envelopes can be made and addressed and a 
play post office established, further delight and realism 
is added to the process. With older children, as well as 
with little children, a real correspondence may be carried 
on with other rooms and schools in other parts of the 
nation. In this latter case, the pupils write about the 
striking or peculiar things in their locality to other pupils 
entirely unacquainted with these things, but who, the 
writers believe, will be interested in their descriptions. 
What may be called superlative or unusual experiences 
always possess interest for the narrator and usually for the 
audience. The time at which we were most thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-96
80 LANGUAGE 
frightened, the worst horse we ever broke, the hardest 
rabbit to trap, are things that we wish to tell about and 
that other people enjoy hearing. These experiences are 
found in the life of every boy and girl; and while he would 
not spend a second to tell about a horse in the abstract, 
he will grow eloquent in describing how he broke a horse, 
if that is unusual to his auditors, or in describing how he 
broke his hardest horse, if breaking horses is a commonplace 
with his audience. 
Autobiographies are interest-provoking. School chil- 
dren occasionally want to write their own biographies, but 
in many cases they love to write the autobiography of a pet 
dog, a knife, a postage stamp, or a pair of shoes. Innu- 
merable topics may be used; and the interest in this fanciful 
undertaking can, if not overdone, be used at least once a 
month during the eight years. 
Another fruitful source of interesting material is the fund 
of stories of strange characters and episodes of earlier times 
that are to be found in any community. There are always 
people who know many of these anecdotes, and certain 
pupils may be assigned to visit them, get some good stories 
and write them up for the school. 
Directions for playing a game or the description of a 
trip are of interest, if the game is a new one, or if the trip 
is one that the whole class has not taken. Sometimes 
when a new winter game is wanted, a competition may be 
held in which each pupil in the class describes some new 
game (if he knows one), all descriptions to be read carefully 
by the class and that one to be selected which seems most 
interesting. If the game is not clearly explained, that fact 
becomes immediately apparent to the writer. 
The upholding of one side or the other of a matter under 
class discussion furnishes the pupil with a strong motive for 
effective writing, because he is anxious to convince his 
   
-P-A-G-E-97
  INTEREST 81 
opponents. The writer is interested; he knows that the 
opposition is interested, but cannot have the facts, or it 
would not be in opposition. He sets to work enthusias- 
tically, therefore, to talk on paper. 
Imaginary stories are in many cases very interesting. 
I well remember the wonderful and weird stories that my 
chum and I, as boys of eleven, used to make up for fun, 
spending hour after hour upon the exercise. There was 
no halting in our language or our imagery. Many people 
tell me that when they were in the grades they had a desire 
to write books and stories and would frequently begin 
onthem. More children than we suspect have this same 
interest in imaginary stories. That interest should be 
utilized to its full extent. 
These are a few suggestions for teachers, and within them 
the teacher can undoubtedly find material enough to keep 
his pupils supplied for a term of years. 
Summary. Interesting topics may be secured by dressing re- 
productions in new clothes, through letter writing, through the 
suggestion of superlative and other unusual experiences, in fanci- 
ful autobiographies, in local historical episodes, through debates 
and imaginary stories. 
An Interested but Ignorant Audience. In order to be 
thoroughly interested himself, the writer has to feel that 
his audience is interested, and that he can tell the group of 
persons to whom he addresses himself some things that 
they do not already know. Missionaries are impelled by 
exactly this idea. They have something that the heathen 
do not know, and until the audience shows interest, it is 
very hard for the missionary to keep on talking and work- 
ing. When he gets an interested audience of learners, he 
preaches with more than his usual enthusiasm. 
An interested audience makes one do his very best. Any 
one can verify this. Think how eloquently you and I con-
-P-A-G-E-98
  82 LANGUAGE 
verse when some one listens with interest to our stories, 
especially about that most interesting topic — ourselves. 
To help the child feel that his audience does not know 
more than he does, it is well to have him read his com- 
position to the class so that he will feel that they are his 
audience. If he does not read to the class, he will feel that 
his teacher is his audience, and he is not likely to feel that 
he can tell the teacher much. And the teacher sometimes 
fosters this feeling in inverse proportion to the amount 
he knows. If he does not know much outside the book, 
he tends to want to make the pupils feel that they cannot 
tell him much, because he is afraid that he will be found 
out. If he knows a great deal, he is aware of the fact that 
any normal boy or girl can tell him things of which he never 
dreamed. 
There are some things, such as the principles and the 
fundamental facts of each subject, which all pupils expect 
their teacher to know, and ignorance in these matters lowers 
the teacher in their estimation. But in all the rest of 
knowledge outside the book, boys and girls not only are 
glad to tell the teacher things he does not know, but also 
admire the teacher all the more because they are able to 
give him information. 
If a boy gets into the habit of thinking about his au- 
dience, not only will he write and talk better, but he will 
search among the topics he might write and talk about to 
find those that are both interesting to him and interesting 
to his audience. This will help him to keep from being a 
bore when he grows up; for a bore is merely one who does 
not notice whether what he is talking about interests his 
audience or not, and in the absence of his observation keeps 
on talking. 
Sometimes other schools can be made the audience for 
themes as well as for letters; two teachers in neighboring
-P-A-G-E-99
  INTEREST 83 
schools can arrange to have their pupils write back and 
forth on interesting topics of practical value. Again, in- 
genuity on the part of the teachers helps wonderfully in 
setting up what we know to be ideal conditions for good 
writing and speaking. 
The audience can be used in a very definite way to show 
a pupil that he needs to correct some points, or to give him 
merited praise. After the pupil has read his paper to the 
class, the teacher can ask the class if they got the idea, or, 
if not, what seems to be the trouble. Harsh criticism should 
not be allowed, nor will it be given; for pupils, while frank, 
are good natured in this work. Nor is it a difficult thing 
to make the plan practical; a little care on the part of the 
teacher will lead them to be discriminating critics. 
Summary. Written work should be prepared to be read to the 
class, which serves as an interested and not too learned audience. 
It is not necessary that everything written be read to the class. 
It is only necessary for the writer to feel that what he is writing 
may be read to the class. 
Immediate Interest. What we have been saying in con- 
nection with an audience and a list of interesting topics is 
preparatory to the discussion of interest in language forms, 
such as punctuation, grammatical definitions, and so forth. 
In this section, our query is this: How shall we get in- 
terest in all these forms of language? And the answer, in 
outline, is the same here as elsewhere. That is, there are 
three cases. Either the pupils are interested in language 
forms, or they are not. If they are, nothing need be done; 
but if they are not, then an appeal may be made to generic 
values, or to the specific need. 
The first of these is easily disposed of. We shall suppose 
that they are not interested in such topics as punctuation, 
and therefore we must inquire into methods of securing 
interest.
-P-A-G-E-100
84 LANGUAGE 
Mediate Interest through Generic Incentives. If the pu- 
pils are not interested in language forms, we may attempt 
to create this interest by an appeal to such things as grades, 
promotion, graduation, the sense of duty, avoidance of 
punishment, and so forth. These motives, as we have said 
in the two earlier chapters in the book, are commonly used 
and clearly understood by the readers. The less worthy 
motives in the list should never be used; the more worthy 
should be used only when the method to be discussed below 
fails to work. 
Specific Needs. In earlier chapters we said that the best 
method and the hardest to handle in securing mediate in- 
terest is to inquire into the intrinsic function of the item 
to be studied, and create or find situations in line with this. 
We know that language forms are intended to help in the 
communication of valuable ideas and impressions; and if 
we wish to create a specific need for studying any particular 
form, the pupil will have to see that he has failed to convey 
his idea, and must be made sorry for his failure. 
Now this leads us to familiar ground. If we want the 
pupils to be interested in forms, punctuation, rules, and so 
forth, the best thing to do first is to let them write on in- 
teresting topics, as first outlined above. Then if they 
become aware of the fact that their audience is not under- 
standing what they are talking and writing about, they will 
be ready to remedy their defects and cure their errors. This 
brings us back to the second point — the correction of the 
errors that arise. If pupils are interested in writing com- 
positions and papers, they will be glad to correct errors, 
especially if they see clearly that the errors keep them from 
being understood. 
Errors we have discussed in each of the two preceding 
chapters. The new point we stress here is that we must 
have the children interested in the topics upon which they
-P-A-G-E-101
  INTEREST 85 
write, and we have illustrated in part what these topics 
may be. I have no fear of the ultimate writing and talking 
ability of pupils who write and talk for an interested audi- 
ence upon interesting topics, provided they have a teacher 
who has a fine sense for correctness, who uses each practical 
occasion to teach them the correct form in place of their 
errors, and who shows them the easiest way out of their 
difficulties. 
Summary. Pupils either are interested or are not interested in 
language forms. If they are not, then an appeal may be made to 
generic values, or to specific needs. In the latter case the im- 
portant thing is to have the children interested in what they write, 
and to have their errors corrected as they occur. 
Desire for Improvement. Just as in spelling and hand- 
writing, so in language, it has been found possible to 
stimulate the pupils to work upon their own errors. If they 
can measure their progress, the stimulation will be still 
more keen. This measurement of progress is not par- 
ticularly difficult, at least in some of the phases of the work. 
For instance, in punctuation, and capitalization also, it is 
easily possible to have the children write a composition of 
which the first hundred words are selected, and the number 
of errors in, say, periods, question marks, and capitals 
noted from week to week and from month to month. 
These home-made tests are very easy to make. The 
children are glad to see that they are making an improve- 
ment, if they are. In oral speech it is more difficult to 
compare the number of errors made by a pupil at one time 
with the number made at another, because he may not, 
at one time, use the same words that he uses at another, 
and so may not make the same mistakes. But even in the 
case of oral language the teacher may occasionally set 
aside a part of the school day or listen at intermission and 
actually keep tally on the number of mistakes that he has
-P-A-G-E-102
  
86° LANGUAGE 
heard during the stipulated time. Undoubtedly -the 
teacher who is anxious to record the skill of children can 
find many home-made devices for doing this, even if he is 
not in a position to obtain the standard tests. 
Mass Assault. One of the most serious difficulties that 
the teacher has to face in securing results arises from the 
fact that the school is not with the teacher in the desire for 
improvement in the use of speech. It frequently happens 
that boys who have a feeling for good speech and would like 
to use it are afraid to do so because other boys will say that 
they have “swallowed the dictionary,” which is, of course, 
one of the most heinous of small boy offenses. This means 
that in such a school what I call a “mass assault” should 
be made upon the problem of correct language. The morale 
of the whole school must be raised before anything can be 
done with individuals. This calls for real leadership on the 
part of the teacher, who can handle it through conversation, 
campaigns, and his own example. If he is a stimulating 
leader of the group he will get everybody with him; if he is 
not, his teaching of language will be merely tolerated. 
Specific directions about how to accomplish this are diffi- 
cult to give because it is a psychological matter and depends 
upon the relation of the teacher to the children. If he sets 
out with the determination to sell them the ideal of good 
speech for business, social, and artistic reasons, he will have 
to be sufficiently resourceful to find methods of convincing 
the children that what he wants is right. Certainly hemust 
be strongly interested in the proposition himself and must 
be facile in convincing his group. 
Correlation. The other subjects in the course of study 
are related to language in two ways. They provide some 
of the content for language lessons and furnish a place in 
which the language rules may be applied. 
We should certainly be familiar by this time with the
-P-A-G-E-103
METHODS OF LANGUAGE STUDY 87 
fact that a teacher’s success as an instructor in spelling, 
writing, grammar, and all forms of language is.to be judged 
by the natural everyday language of the pupils in con- 
nection with their life outside the language class. If a 
teacher tolerates bad language forms in any other class, 
that teacher is not a good language teacher. 
In the rural schools, where time is so valuable, the great 
bulk of the language work must be done incidentally in 
connection with other subjects. This is, of course, true of 
city schools as well, except that in these the teacher has 
much more time for special language classes than has the 
teacher in the country; and, consequently, since the rural 
teacher has less time for special classes, the greater part of 
the teaching of language must be incidental. 
We have spoken about the danger of using material 
taken from the other school subjects for work in the special 
language class, pointing out the likelihood of the pupils’ 
feeling that all the rest of the class know the material and 
of there being, therefore, little interest or motive for writ- 
ing. I refer to it here again to emphasize the important 
point made above; that this lack of interest may be ob- 
viated in great measure if, in the reproduction, the teacher 
arranges to have the reproduction solve some problem, or 
answer some interesting question, instead of taking the 
- form of a prosy résumé. If this is done, reproductive work 
is good; if it is not done, it is an abomination to boys and 
girls, and detrimental to language work. 
Summary. Language is essentially a subject to be taught in 
correlation with other subjects, particularly in the rural school 
where time for special classes is so short. 
3. Methods of Language Study 
In the effective study of language forms it is important 
that students should be interested and that they should 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 LANGUAGE 
feel considerable freedom in writing. The first of these 
we have discussed a great deal in the past few pages. The 
second has been partially discussed already. 
Freedom. To get pupils to feel free in their writing, three 
things are necessary. In the first place, they must have 
an opportunity to write their thoughts just as they occur 
to them without being bothered about ink spots or legi- 
bility. That is, the teacher should allow a first and second 
draft. This we have already discussed. In the second 
place, the teacher must praise good work even more than 
he censures poor work. John is not to be judged by the 
standards of Shakespeare or Emerson. He is just an average 
ten-year-old boy. Adverse criticism should be given, but 
it should not outweigh praise when effort has been put 
forth. For the boy who is praised for good work will grow 
proud of it and will take criticisms with intelligence and 
good grace. In the third place, the teacher should not 
mark every error. Judged by absolute standards a third- 
grade pupil may have twenty mistakes on a page, while 
an eighth-grade pupil has only three, notwithstanding the 
fact that the eighth-grade pupil is better able to stand up 
under twenty corrections than he was in the third grade. 
So, instead of burying the third-grade child under a mass 
of corrections, the teacher will do well to mark only those 
errors which the pupil is able to correct by the rules already 
learned in class. If one moves slowly and has patience, 
and is not too greatly concerned about temporarily passing 
over errors, he will win out in the end through careful 
attention directed to errors one at a time. 
Socialized Recitation. Into current literature has been 
introduced recently the term “the socialized recitation.” 
Much has been written upon the subject and detailed 
directions are given for carrying it on. Although when 
one reads the literature it appears to be a rather formidable 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  METHODS OF LANGUAGE STUDY 89 
method, in essence it is very simple and easy of application. 
What it means is this: In the socialized recitation the 
teacher talks the proposition over with the children and 
gets their ideas on how to carry it out. In ordinary class- 
work, on the other hand, the teacher stands in front of the 
children and tells them what to do or asks them questions 
about what they have done. In the socialized recitation 
the teacher becomes one of the group, a sort of chairman of 
the group, and talks things over with the pupils. Some- 
times the teacher formally organizes the class into com- 
mittees on a project. For instance, in a seventh-grade 
lesson on the use of the dictionary, there might be a com- 
mittee on speed, another on spelling, one to look after the 
accents, another syllabication, and so on, although or- 
ganization into committees is not necessary. The success 
of the socialized recitation depends upon this — the 
teacher gives the children an opportunity to think out 
plans for themselves as a group instead of laying down the 
law to them and telling them exactly what to do. For in- 
stance, the problem of correcting seen and saw would become 
a socialized recitation when the teacher laid before the 
children this problem: “Seen and saw give us a great deal 
of trouble. Now what had we better do about it?” This 
puts the question squarely up to the children and their 
ideas are called for. Perhaps they have a half-dozen sug- 
gestions. These are discussed and weighed and perhaps 
all the suggestions are accepted and the teacher says, 
“Now, who will look after this?” The answer to that 
question will decide the next step. In the socialized reci- 
tation the teacher puts the proposition up to the pupils and 
gets their help. In that sense he is like the chairman of a 
committee. His business is to get all the members of the 
committee to work. But while he is chairman of the com- 
mittee he is also the referee and judge.

Summary. In brief, the socialized recitation is a device used by 
the teacher for the sake of getting the children to think for them- 
selves by facing them with problems and eliciting their suggestions 
for solution. 
Drill. Naturally, drill plays a very important part in 
language work. Usually the problem is to get pupils to 
substitute good habits for bad, but in some cases the prob- 
lem is that of setting up new, good habits. 
As we have seen before, the first point necessary is to 
have a clear initial impression. The second is the securing 
of attentive repetition, the third is the continuation of this 
repetition until habit becomes automatic, and the fourth 
is to see that the children like it. When Willie Smith, who 
as yet has not studied grammar, says, “He don’t know,” 
one way to handle the case is to say at once, “Willie, you 
must say, ‘He doesn’t know.’” This Willie may do, but in 
addition it is wise to save this point for the class recitation © 
and spend enough time on the subject to make it clear. 
Several sentences may be put upon the board — thus: 
I don’t know He doesn’t know 
You don’t know They don’t know 
If the class understand grammar the teacher can talk 
about third person singular agreement, etc., but if they 
have not studied grammar the pupils may repeat these 
short sentences noticing that “He does” is always use 48 
It may be amplified by the following inductive process: 
“The boy does not go.” “The man does not want it.” 
“The girl does not like to go.” “Boys do not go.” “The 
men do not want it.” “The girls do not like to go.” These 
may be shortened into: “The boy doesn’t go.” “The ma 
doesn’t want it.” “The girl doesn’t like to go.” “Boys 
don’t go.” “The men don’t want it.” “The girls don’t 
like to go.”

METHODS OF LANGUAGE STUDY 91 
Paul and I have collected a large number which are pub- 
lished by the U. S. Bureau of Education as Bulletin No. 43, 
1923. These were collected, through the Commissioner’s 
office, from all over the United States. 
Speed exercises have also been worked out as found in 
several textbooks. Sometimes these take the form of 
alternative exercises as, ““He (don’t, doesn’t) go,” “I have 
(seen, saw) him.” Occasionally completion exercises are 
used, as when the pupils are asked to insert the right form 
seen, or saw in the following sentences: “I him yester- 
day.” “I have —— that before.” Or the true-false 
practice test may be used. In this case the children are 
told that some of the sentences are right and some are 
wrong and are asked to give the correct form. Here 
sentences would appear like this: ““We went to town,” 
“He gave it to her and I,” “He don’t look well to-day,” 
and the children would be asked to correct the incorrect 
ones. 
When such exercises are being used it is important that 
the children go over them very rapidly because automatic 
and glib use of correct forms is absolutely essential. If the 
children have to stop to think, they are inclined to become 
confused. 
Correction. In language work it is necessary that, on the 
cue hand, the pupil be sensitive to errors and that,’on the 
other, the teacher and the rest of the class should correct 
him. Just how to do this so as to keep from wounding the 
sensibilities of the child who makes a mistake is a some- 
-vhat serious question. In the first place, the idea must be 
old to the class that when corrections are made they are 
made in good faith and for the benefit of the one who is in 
error. The spirit must be right. In the second place, the 
prigs in the class should be curbed so that they will not sit 
through the recitation watching for mistakes like vultures  
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 LANGUAGE 
circling around waiting for a man to die — if such a ghoulish 
comparison may be permitted. In the third place, the 
mistakes should not be caught up, usually, until the child 
has finished what he has to say. Otherwise the thread of 
the recitation is broken, unless the error is one that has 
already been drilled upon and by an inconspicuous gesture 
on the part of the teacher the pupil can catch the slip im- 
mediately and proceed with his statement. In brief, errors 
must be called to the attention of a person if he is to correct 
them, and this must be done by himself, by his classmates, 
and by the teacher, but it must never be done in such a way 
as to hurt his feelings or disturb the recitation. 
In the last analysis the judgment of the effectiveness of 
language work is dependent upon the question, “Did I get 
my idea across in good shape?” No matter how correct 
the expression may be in form, the audience has to be taken 
into account in deciding upon the effectiveness of speech. 
If the idea did not get across, then the second question 
raised is, “Why not?” The answer to this question will 
show the points at which the delivery did not reach stand- 
ard. But if the answer is “Yes” or “Yes, in some re- 
spects,” and the question “Why?” is asked again, the 
answers indicate the point at which the standards have 
been reached with reasonable success. 
Language Projects. Language touches projects in two 
directions. Language is used in many other projects. 
Whenever children have to describe or explain or record 
anything in connection with a project in geography or 
civics or art, language becomes a part of the project. But 
in addition to this, there are such things as language proj- 
ects, and to put our fingers upon these we need only to 
look for natural situations where language would ordinarily 
be used in some other way than as a mere assignment. For 
instance, letter writing may become a project when the
-P-A-G-E-109
    METHODS OF LANGUAGE STUDY 93 
teacher says, or the pupils suggest, “Wouldn’t it be a good 
idea for us to write a letter to Tom while he is in the hos- 
pital?” This is a project because it would be the normal 
thing to do between friends in connection with letter- 
writing, outside of school. The socializing element can 
be used by the teacher’s turning back to the class and 
saying, “Well, how shall we proceed?” 
In selecting projects there are a number of devices. The 
simplest of all cases, according to Hatfield, is that in which 
the teacher calls attention to a situation which calls for 
action, such as writing a letter to Tom. Other timely oc- 
casions for letter writing and composition work may come 
to mind. Perhaps a drinking fountain is needed, or a 
larger gymnasium class. Or possibly the citizens are in- 
different about the school because they do not know what 
is going on. Again, the school team may lack support. 
Perhaps pupils will be interested in knowing a list of good 
books. Or contributions to local papers can be made. In 
addition to this, as Hatfield again points out, we can base 
projects upon the children’s natural desire “just to want 
to talk.” They may have a good joke they want to tell, 
may want to describe a beautiful scene, bring in an anec- 
dote, or even make up stories to tell. 
One of the most important projects that the children can 
work upon is that of the improvement of their own speech. 
They can devise numerous ways and means for doing this. 
They can take charge of the plans, judge of the results, and 
carry them through as described above in the paragraph on 
the socialized recitation. 
Summary. In searching for projects, the teacher will look for 
situations in which children would, outside of the fact that they 
are studying language in the language class, normally use oral or 
— language as a means of carrying out the things they want 
to do.

Alternation. If grammar is taught in the eighth grade 
only, language may alternate in the sixth and seventh 
grades, and in the fourth and fifth grades. Below the fourth 
grade, if there is any class that is called a language class, 
the differences in the development of the pupils are so 
marked that alternation is not advisable. If grammar is 
taught in the seventh and eighth grades, it is possible to 
alternate in those grades. The fifth and sixth may alter- 
nate, and possibly the third and fourth. But the best plan 
for alternation is the one first mentioned — teaching 
grammar only in the eighth grade and grouping grades four 
and five, and grades six and seven, for the purpose of 
alternating in language.

  CHAPTER IV 
GRAMMAR 
1. Subject-Matter 
The Function of Grammar. The difference between the pur- 
pose in teaching language and that in teaching grammar is 
this: In language when we correct grammatical forms we 
merely teach the correct form, while in grammar we explain 
why it is correct. It is therefore apparent that grammar 
is studied, from my point of view at least, merely as an 
adjunct to language, and that all that has been said about 
errors of language applies to grammar and need not be 
repeated. ; 
Some people become quite heated when they discuss the 
function of grammar, because there are such radical differ- 
ences of opinion upon the subject. One group of people 
says that the function of grammar is to enable one to speak 
correctly; to train boys who say “‘They ain’t” to say “They 
are not,” and to explain why the latter is correct. But 
another group asserts that grammar is studied to explain 
the structure of English. Grammar, say these advocates, 
is a science that helps us to understand the sentence, to 
know why we speak as we do; but as a science it is not 
concerned with the art of speech. For a science and an 
art differ in this, that a science helps us to understand, but 
an art is concerned with doing. The science of human 
speech explains why we speak as we do; the art of human 
speech, speaks. 
These two groups of people quarrel constantly. The 
scholarly grammarian who likes to study grammar holds
-P-A-G-E-113
  SUBJECT-MATTER 97 
that it is a science and is not concerned with making people 
speak correctly. Many teachers hold the same view and 
make no attempt to apply the rules of grammar to the 
speech of the children. 
The other group holds that a university graduate or a 
high-school graduate may be justified in studying grammar 
merely as the science of speech, because every man has a 
right to study anything he likes. But the members of this 
group say also that the only excuse for teaching grammar, 
at least in the elementary school, is the improvement of 
incorrect speech. These opponents claim that there are 
a great many things of more importance for the boy and 
the girl in the grades than a little knowledge about such a 
very abstruse and difficult subject as grammar, unless it is 
to be used in making pupils use correct English. 
I belong to this second group. For I see little use for the 
study of grammar in the grades except as an aid in correct- 
ing speech. But to make the whole position clear, let us 
approach it from another angle. 
As you remember, the function of spelling was to arrange 
letters in words. ‘The function of grammar is to explain 
the relation of words in a sentence. With the order of 
letters in words, grammar is not concerned; it investigates 
the relations of words in sentences. These relations are 
given such names as subject and predicate, noun, verb, 
phrase, ete. 
If grammar studies the relations of words in sentences, 
some boy with a dislike for the subject may ask the use of 
knowing about the relation of words in sentences. Why 
study about nouns, pronouns, predicates, and verbs? 
Two answers are usually given. One of these says, If you 
use incorrect forms, educated people will make fun of you. 
This ridicule is not always expressed by a smile or a laugh 
or by aspoken word, but it is registered inside. The person
-P-A-G-E-114
98 GRAMMAR 
who knows better and hears a mistake in grammar notices 
it even if he does not make any sign. He says to himself, 
“This person is a rather crude or careless individual.” 
Many teachers fail to get high positions because they make 
grammatical mistakes. Sometimes a teacher makes more 
mistakes than his pupils, and then the pupils make fun of 
him and he loses his influence. 
Since, however, ninety-five per cent of all children and 
teachers come from homes or communities where incorrect 
English is used, nearly every one has before him the long, 
hard task of overcoming habits set up in early life before 
he studied language and grammar in school. In fact, it is 
not an uncommon experience to hear university professors 
make mistakes in grammar, not because they do not know 
better, not because they do not try hard to speak correctly, 
but because when they were little boys they lived with 
people who spoke ungrammatically and from whom they 
learned wrong forms. Such people are exposed to the 
ridicule of those who notice the error, and the only way in 
which they can cure themselves is by eternal vigilance and 
the study of English grammar. 
The second reason for studying grammar is that we may 
know how to select the correct forms. For instance, Willie 
Roberts is in the habit of saying, “Him and me is going.” 
Teacher corrects Willie over and over, in the class, telling 
him that he should say, “He and I are going.” But Willie 
is corrected so often that after a while he reaches a condition 
in which he is unable to remember which of these expressions 
is right. Here, say the practical people, is where grammar 
helps. If the boy learns the case forms of the pronouns and 
the rule for the agreement of subject and predicate in num- 
ber, he need not depend upon a hazy memory for a correct 
form, but can work it out for himself. If he knows that the 
nominative case for him and me is he and J, it will then be 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
SUBJECT-MATTER an 
easier to remember which is correct. Herein is the essential 
reason, it seems to me, for the study of grammar in the 
grades. It shows the speaker how to select correct forms 
for himself. 
In baseball the best managers tell their players to obey 
the rules of the game on every occasion. The players may 
feel that they can break the rules of the game once in a 
while and gain by it — a player may run from first to third, 
cutting out second, and “get away with it” when the 
umpire’s back is turned. But the manager will not allow 
it because he knows that, in the long run, if one does not 
follow the rules, the game will punish him. 
» Just so in grammar. I may say, “They ain’t,” “It’s 
me,” “Him and I,” and so forth all the time and have 
people understand me; but I am breaking the rules of 
correct speech in the talking game, and every once in a 
while I am sure to be misunderstood. My percentage of 
effectiveness will not be so high as it would be if I followed 
therules. My ideas will suffer by virtue of my carelessness. 
Summary. The function of grammar is to assist in the accu- 
rate conveyance of ideas to others by giving due regard to the 
relations of words in the sentence. We use correct forms in gram- 
mar so that we may be understood and so that educated people 
cannot belittle our training. While grammar may be studied 
for itself alone in higher institutions, its only justification in the 
elementary school curriculum is as a first aid to injured speech 
and broken grammatical rules. 
Ideals. Four ideals need to be developed in connection 
with the teaching of grammar. (1) Accuracy is essential. 
If the student has the ideal of accuracy he will learn the 
rules and definitions and in parsing and analyzing he will 
get the material correct. (2) Speed is the second ideal. 
As will be pointed out elsewhere, unless children learn to 
parse words with great speed, the study of grammar is not 
of great value. If the child is going to make use of grammar

-P-A-G-E-116
  100 GRAMMAR 
at all in deciding which forms are right and which are 
wrong, he must do it almost automatically while he talks. 
(3) The student must develop a sensitiveness to incorrect 
forms. Frequently children make mistakes without know- 
ing that they are mistakes. (4) Following immediately 
upon this is the ideal of persistence in correction. Pupils 
frequently know the correct forms but grow careless or dis- 
couraged about using them constantly. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. There are four objectives 
which the teacher should have in mind in the teaching of 
grammar. (1) He must develop a liking for grammar, if it 
is to be used. (2) The teacher must see that the children 
use their grammar in the correction of mistakes. The 
definitions, of course, are learned in order to understand 
the rules. Definitions are not broken, but whenever a rule 
is broken, the children should be shown how the memory 
of the definition helps them to correct the error, or, better 
still, keeps them from making the error. Exercises should 
be given to children and their errors should be examined, 
both for the purpose of giving them facility in using gram- 
mar and as drill in correct speech. Many children can 
pass a good examination on grammar and be totally un- 
aware of the fact that it has anything to do with the 
everyday mistakes which they make. (3) The teacher 
must develop skill, both as to speed and accuracy, par- 
ticularly in parsing and analysis. (4) Finally, the suc- 
cessful teacher will see that the children use reason as well 
as memory in grammar. The inductive method, which is 
developed in the latter part of the chapter, may be used 
with excellent results in the teaching of rules and definitions. 
In parsing and analysis the problem method of attack 
should be used. 
Errors and Difficulties. When we come to a consideration 
of the errors which we use as a basis for the teaching of
-P-A-G-E-117
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 101 
grammar, we find them the same as those in language. 
Children make mistakes other than grammatical errors in 
language, but from the language errors we select those 
which break grammatical rules. The errors that have 
been discovered were discussed in the chapter on language. 
The children, however, have difficulties in the learning 
of grammar. Of these there are at least four. First, 
children may not learn grammar efficiently because they 
may be poor silent readers. They may not understand the 
vocabulary or may learn it in a very hazy and indefinite 
way. (2) They may be very slow in their parsing, analyz- 
ing, and the exercises of grammar. (3) They may not 
reason accurately. (4) They may not have any of the fore- 
going faults and still fail in the use of grammar because they 
do not apply it to ordinary speech. These errors have to 
be taken into account in the teaching of the subject. 
Standards. Two standards are set up by the two opposing 
sides in the debate over the teaching of grammar. One 
group says that a student has a good hold on grammar if he 
can analyze and parse with ability and accuracy. The 
other group says that it does not matter how well a person 
may be able to analyze and parse; he has little hold upon 
grammar if he does not speak grammatically. One party 
sets up a scientific standard, the other an artistic standard. 
Which of these two is right, and under what conditions 
one or the other may be right, matters little to the grade 
teacher. For him there is only one standard that should 
satisfy. It does not matter how well his pupils can analyze 
and parse, if they use ungrammatical language. Unless 
they speak accurately, their knowledge of grammar is just 
so much chaff. 
This is a difficult standard to attain for three reasons. 
First in importance, the pupils have heard ungrammatical 
language all their lives and have had habits firmly fixed at
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 GRAMMAR 
home and among neighbors. Second, the teacher has the 
pupils not more than six hours out of the twenty-four, and 
during that time the average boy or girl does no more talk- 
ing than he does in ten minutes outside school. So the 
teacher has very little opportunity to help him by reitera- 
tion upon the same errors over and over again, day by day, 
precept upon precept, and line upon line. In the third 
place, in many communities, if pupils should use correct 
forms they would be laughed at by the neighbors as “smart 
alecks” and would be dubbed “stuck-ups.” To bashful 
country boys and girls this is a penalty so biting that it 
takes great confidence in a teacher to overcome the handi- 
cap. 
Summary. There are two possible standards for judging the 
hold a pupil has upon grammar. One is skill in parsing and 
analyzing; the other is ability to speak grammatically outside 
the grammar class. The latter is the practical working standard 
by which a teacher may justly judge of his ability as a teacher. 
Structure. We have stated the specific function of gram- 
mar as that of assisting in the communication of valuable 
ideas by attending to the relation of words in the sentence. 
Such being its function, it is interesting to note how the 
sentence is organized to convey ideas with increasing ac- 
curacy. There are eight parts of speech, and these are 
arranged around a subject and predicate. By these few 
elements all spoken thought is expressed. No matter what 
one wishes to say, he must use some of the eight parts of 
speech. ; 
It is a remarkable fact, when one thinks of it, that little 
children express a whole sentence in one word. ‘Two-year- 
old“Mary says, “Milk,” and means, “Give me some milk 
quickly”’; or she says, “Hot,” and means, “This stove is 
hot; so I had better be careful.” All her sentences are 
single words, and yet they express ideas.
-P-A-G-E-119
  SUBJECT-MATTER 103 
Grammarians tell us that, in all probability, when people 
began to use language, hundreds of thousands of years ago, 
they used single expressions for whole sentences, just as 
children do now. They did not employ subject and predi- 
cate, noun, verb, and adverb. 
We have that same sort of sentence now in the inter- 
jection. When I hit my finger with a hammer, instead of 
using a long and accurate sentence, saying, “I have hit my 
finger with the hammer. It hurts, and I am very angry,” 
I say, “Ouch!” This expresses the idea. 
The important point is that this single expression, which 
primitive men used, cannot be very accurate. So the 
sentence grew, just as it does with children. After the 
baby says, “Hot” for a while, she may say, “Stove hot,” 
or, “Milk hot,” which is more accurate than is “‘hot” 
alone. 
As time went on, each generation tried to be more 
accurate, and so new elements were added to the sentence 
to make greater accuracy. Of these cases let me give a few 
examples. For instance, the adjective lends accuracy. 
I might say, “Buy me a hammer.” But if I may use 
adjectives, I can say, “Buy me a very small tack hammer.” 
This gives greater accuracy by making the noun more 
definite. The tenses make the verb more definite. If we 
had only one tense form we could not tell whether our 
friend has been married, was married, is married, is being 
married, will be married, or will have been married some- 
time. Little children are not able to express these fine 
shades of meaning until they have learned the tense form. 
Many grammarians have made a classification of all the 
parts of speech and all the forms that each part of speech 
undergoes in expressing exact shades of meaning. They 
differ among themselves in little details, but, in the main, 
they agree on the chief modifications.
-P-A-G-E-120
  104 GRAMMAR 
The following is a classification of the noun, which may 
be accepted for purposes of illustration: 
Classes: Common, Proper. 
Properties: Gender — Masculine, Feminine, Common, Neuter. 
Number — Singular, Plural. Case — Nominative, Objec- 
tive, Possessive. 
The important fact to remember is that each of these 
items helps to make the communication of ideas more 
accurate. Take, for instance, the two classes of noun. 
Evidently it is sometimes of advantage to be able to say, 
“John is going to the city,” rather than to say, “A man is 
going to the city.” The proper name makes for greater 
exactness by designating that particular member of the 
group who is meant. 
In like manner sex is a very important consideration in 
all life. It is fundamental, and people have to take it into 
constant consideration. It is, therefore, in the interests of 
accuracy to have separate forms for each sex. It is more 
accurate to say, “Men are hearty eaters,’ than to say, 
“Some people are hearty eaters.” Boy and girl are more 
definite than children. 'These examples are given to illus- 
trate how every form and part of speech has a different 
work to perform in helping people to be more accurate in 
what they have to say. And if one takes all the forms of 
all the parts of speech, he can show that the same principles 
hold true everywhere in grammar. 
Summary. The sentence has been developed in the history of 
mankind and is developed in the case of every child from a single 
word, which expresses an idea inaccurately, to the very compli- 
cated, but more exact form in which adults to-day use it. Every 
grammatical form which has thus been evolved has a definite work 
to perform in producing this result. 
Parsing and Analysis. Parsing and analysis are not in- 
tricate and mysterious processes. Their business is to state 
the relations that exist between words in the sentence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  SUBJECT-MATTER 105 
Analysis takes the sentence and dissects it, or breaks it 
up, into its component parts. For instance, in the sentence, 
“The King of Spain may come to America in June,” 
analysis proceeds to state subject, predicate, modifiers, etc., 
as follows: 
Kind of sentence — simple, declarative. 
Subject — King. 
Modifiers — (1) the, (2) of Spain. 
Predicate — may come. 
Modifiers — (1) to America, (2) in June. 
Here the sentence is broken up into its smaller groups, 
and the relationship of each is shown. These groups are 
sometimes phrases, as of Spain, in June, ete. They may 
be clauses, as in complex and compound sentences; and, 
of course, they may be single words, as King above. 
Parsing simply carries this process one step further. In 
an analysis we make a rough dissection, while in parsing 
we make a minute dissection showing the exact relationship 
of each word in the sentence. For instance, in parsing the 
sentence given above, we would carry it through in a 
thorough-going manner by beginning with The and taking 
up each word as we went along. 
For the one who is to parse every word, analysis is just. 
the first step in which the words are roughly sorted into 
groups ready and waiting to be sorted more carefully in the 
parsing process. 
Diagramming. In analysis and parsing, people sometimes 
use devices when the matter is to be put upon paper. When 
I was taught analysis, I used the form that I have just 
given above. Other people use other devices, and a great 
many have used and are using diagrams. 
Strong objections are urged against diagramming; but it 
is a handy device when used in moderation. It saves time. 
I shall give no advice upon the kind of diagram to use,
-P-A-G-E-122
106 GRAMMAR 
except to say, first, that it should be as simple as possible, 
and second, that it should not be used exclusively. For 
the ideal for which we should strive is to be able to analyze 
mentally as we read along. In so far as analysis is carried 
on, it may be diagrammed, or given orally, and sometimes 
it should be written out after a form similar to the one 
given in connection with the sentence above. Care should 
be taken to see that no pupil uses the diagram mechanically 
or juggles with the form without understanding the process. 
Summary. Parsing is the process by which we state the rela- 
tion between words in the sentence. Analysis is the first step 
in parsing, in which the sentence is broken up into groups of words 
preparatory to parsing. Diagramming is a device for saving time 
in analyzing and should be used, but with reasonableness and 
care. 
The Course of Study. There are two important questions 
to consider in dealing with the course of study in grammar. 
What grammar should be taught and when should it be 
taught? Opinions differ as to what amount of grammar 
to teach in the grades. One well-known writer asserts that 
it would be wiser not to teach grammar and to throw the 
whole emphasis upon language. On the other hand, many 
textbooks in grammar contain a very complete statement 
of grammatical facts and set up the ideal of teaching the 
children how to analyze any sentence and to parse any 
word in it. 
For the beginning teacher the amount of grammar to be 
taught is largely determined by what is contained in the 
textbook that he happens to use. If the text has just a 
few facts, then only a few facts are taught. If the text 
is full, a full list is taught. Teachers do not omit much, 
because they think that what is to be learned afterward 
depends upon the previous lessons and that therefore if 
anything is missed the pupils will fail to understand what 
follows. The teacher has to depend upon the text to a
-P-A-G-E-123
SUBJECT-MATTER 107 
considerable degree, but to not nearly as great an extent 
as many of them think. It is entirely practicable to omit 
many of the parts of the text in grammars which have too 
many minor facts in them. 
The first thing to do in finding out what to teach is to 
find the common errors made in the community in which 
you teach, and the second thing to do is to pick out those 
parts in the grammar which will explain how to correct 
these errors. 
Upon such a basis as this a course of study has been 
constructed which seems to hold for all parts of the country, 
so far as grammar is concerned. It is rather apparent from 
the extensive studies made that children break about the 
same rules in all parts of the country. Variations in speech 
are usually variations in idiom or pronunciation rather 
than in grammar. The following facts of grammar are 
found in this list: 
Nouns. 
Common and proper to help in capitalization. 
Singular and plural number of importance. 
Possessive case and perhaps nominative and objective for 
assistance in the study of pronouns. 
Gender, chiefly because of errors of agreement of pronouns. 
Pronouns. 
Kinds: personal, demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite and 
relative. 
Personal pronouns are very important; case, gender and 
number. 
Compound personal pronouns. 
Relative pronouns are also very important; case, gender and 
number. 
Adjectives. 
Pronominal adjectives. 
Proper adjectives for capitalization. 
Comparison of adjectives. 
Verbs. 2 
Kinds: transitive, intransitive, and copulative. 
Person and number. The latter is particularly important. 
Tense is very important.
-P-A-G-E-124
  
108 GRAMMAR 
Can and may, shall and will, lie and lay, sit and set. 
Mood is not important. 
Voice is not important. 
Adverbs. 
Comparison of adverbs. 
Distinction between adjectives and adverbs. 
Prepositions. 
Conjunctions. 
Misplaced modifiers. 
Double negatives. 
Syntactical redundance. 
Sentence structure. 
The characteristics of a sentence to the extent that the chil- 
dren know a sentence when they use it, and know how to 
punctuate it. 
Compound, complex, and simple sentences. 
Parsing and analysis. 
Those facts about each part of speech should be included 
= parsing and analysis which are included under each 
above. 
This course of study does not include many of the more 
difficult items which are usually included in a course in 
grammar. For instance, it includes no treatment of 
participles or infinitives and little of mood and voice. 
However, the supporters of this point of view hold that 
since the children do not make errors in the use of these 
elements it is unnecessary to teach them. It, moreover, 
lays more stress upon false syntax than has recently been 
the case because it implies that the children ought to work 
with the incorrect forms in order to correct them. This is 
an interesting and valuable point of view, for a fuller 
description of which the reader may consult the Sixteenth 
Yearbook. 
Summary. The course of study in grammar should be com- 
posed only of the very simplest facts, and particular attention 
should be paid to those parts of the grammar that explain how to 
correct common errors and give the reasons for the correct forms. 
When Should Grammar Be Taught. The question of the 
time to begin teaching grammar depends upon the diffi-
-P-A-G-E-125
    SUBJECT-MATTER 109 
culty: of the grammar. We teach grammar when we ex- 
plain why we use certain forms in language. Since it is 
possible to use correct forms without explaining why they 
are correct, it is possible to teach language without gram- 
mar. When the teacher says to the pupil, “Do not say, 
‘He don’t,’ but say, ‘He doesn’t,’” he is teaching lan- 
guage. But when he makes the pupil understand that he 
should not say, ““He don’t,” because the verb must agree 
with the subject in person and number, he is teaching 
grammar. Our question is, therefore, “In what grades 
shall the teacher begin to teach the terms of grammar so 
that the pupils can explain why certain forms are correct 
while certain others are incorrect?” Opinions and prac- 
tices differ. Some writers advocate the beginning of 
grammar in the fifth grade, but most writers to-day think 
that the seventh grade is best. Grammar is so difficult to 
understand that the children need maturity to comprehend 
it, and it frequently happens that where the children study 
grammar in the fifth and sixth grades they misunderstand 
it so completely that when they come to the seventh and 
eighth grades where they could understand it they are 
hopelessly confused with what they have learned so in- 
correctly and vaguely. Grammar at best is a. difficult 
subject for even the seventh- and eighth-grade children and 
it is better to have them start fresh in the seventh grade. 
However, it is quite clear to experienced teachers that a 
knowledge of some of the parts of speech such as nouns 
and pronouns can be taught in the sixth grade. 
Standard Tests. A few standard tests have been worked 
out for grammar. One of these was developed by the 
writer in conjunction with the diagnostic language tests 
which were mentioned in the last chapter. The grammar 
tests differ from the language tests in one respect. In the 
latter, children are asked to correct certain errors. In the
-P-A-G-E-126
110 GRAMMAR 
former they are asked, in addition to this, to indicate 
which of the list of rules given in the test should be used 
in explaining the correction which they made. Starch has 
a test for the recognition of parts of speech and Kirby has 
one for the application of rules. Details about obtaining 
these can be obtained in the reference to Monroe given at 
the end of the chapter. 
2. Interest 
Immediate Interest. The same classes of motives that 
work in spelling and penmanship will work likewise in 
grammar. Children may be interested in grammar just 
because they like it for its own sake as a subject to study. 
That is, they may have immediate interest in grammar. 
Or they may not like it, in which case any interest that 
they have must be mediate. In getting interest there may 
be an appeal to generic values, such as grades, approbation, 
and so forth, or to specific needs for the subject, depending 
upon its function. These possibilities we shall take up one 
after the other. 
The most striking fact about grammar is that almost 
every child dislikes it, and this is true particularly of the 
boys. It is one of the “hard” subjects for children; and 
only by the greatest effort can they be made to study it 
through an appeal to grades, force, or detention. 
, Why do we find such a deep-seated and far-reaching dis- 
like to the subject? The answer is easy. It is not because 
grammar is really uninteresting, but because the book and 
the teacher take grade children into the subject too far. 
Let me find an illustration to show how taking a person 
into a subject too far kills interest. A little boy of fourteen 
was very fond of learning about botany. He read all the 
stories about flowers and plants that he could find in the 
Youth’s Companion and used to ask his friends for more. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
INTEREST 111 
But when he studied botany in the high school, all his 
interest disappeared because they gave too many Latin 
names and talked too much about cells, cytology, and other 
little things for which he could see no use. A young friend 
of mine was very fond of dabbling with water colors till he 
had to take painting in school under a teacher who taught 
him so much about perspective and masses and details 
that he could not have any fun in painting. 
Grammar would be as well liked as any other subject if 
the pupils were not rushed into hard examples and artificial 
distinctions. Keep the boy in the simple forms and give 
him simple analysis and parsing, and he will not dislike the 
subject so much as he does now. Liking at the expense of 
too great simplicity is not to be advised; grammar should 
not be made too easy, because, if it is, the boys will not like 
it. It ought to be hard enough, but no harder; and it is 
now very hard for seventh- and eighth-grade boys. Un- 
fortunately, teachers have become so used to its difficulty 
that if they made it so simple that they were ashamed of 
its simplicity, it probably would not even then be quite 
simple enough. 
Mediate Interest. If, after every effort to make grammar 
as simple as possible, it should still remain uninteresting — 
not liked for its own sake — we have recourse in school to 
certain generic values, which we have discussed in earlier 
chapters. These incentives are the same for grammar as 
for spelling and penmanship. If Johnnie does not like 
grammar, we may say to him, “You cannot be graduated 
if you fail in grammar,” or, “You must learn this lesson, 
or—” Here we hint at some obscure punishment, which 
is all the more stimulating for being nameless. This is the 
common method of securing interest, a borrowed interest, 
in the subject; and, since it is common, it does not need to 
be discussed at length. It is sufficient to say that these
-P-A-G-E-128
112 GRAMMAR 
generic values are good things to use when everything else 
fails, but they are misused if they are used all the time. 
Creating a Specific Need for Grammar through Com- 
position. We have recourse to one other type of incentive 
in getting interest in grammar. We first find the intrinsic 
function of grammar, and then find situations in which 
something we want to do fails because grammar is not 
made to do its duty. This is just what we do in spelling 
and in writing. 
The intrinsic function of grammar is to assist in con- 
veying values by means of sentences and words. When- 
ever, because of faulty grammar, we cannot communicate 
accurately things we are anxious to communicate, we shall 
feel our inability and be willing to study grammatical 
forms. Whenever we want to tell something very much 
and get all mixed up in the telling because of poor language 
forms, we will study grammar. 
The first thing necessary, then, is for the pupils to work 
on interesting material. They must see an object in their 
language themes and history assignments; and they need, 
too, to see actual cases in which people have not understood 
them because their grammar was incorrect. 
Now, unfortunately, in school, children do not always 
feel that their themes and their oral reports are of enough 
value to make them worry any if what they write is not 
understood. And, unfortunately too, a lenient audience 
may guess at what the ungrammatical sentences mean 
and will not, therefore, make the child realize his failure 
to use correct grammatical forms. It is too bad that these 
are the conditions; but they are, and we have to meet 
them. 
In the face of this situation we ought to try to make 
language work as interesting as possible by methods such 
as were outlined in our last chapter, and should try to make 
   
-P-A-G-E-129
INTEREST 113 
not only grammar but all subjects as interesting as possible. 
Along with this, two or three devices for creating a need 
may be used. 
First, even though a teacher may be able to guess at the 
meaning of an ungrammatical sentence, as, “We-uns wants 
some chalk,” he may say, “There is no such sentence in any 
grammar. I don’t know what you mean; so you must 
speak correctly.” That is, the teacher may pretend that 
he cannot understand ungrammatical sentences. This, 
then, may become an incentive to the study of grammar; 
the teacher and the pupils study to find the rules that will 
tell what is the correct form. This has to be used with 
care and tact, so as not to offend parents in communities 
where ungrammatical language is commonly used. 
Second, errors in written work may be collected by the 
teacher and kept on file for use in making the pupils realize 
their shortcomings. For instance, just before time to take 
up the case endings of pronouns, a series of sentences may 
be put on the board as follows: Her and I, It is me, Who 
did you speak to? etc. This list may be some time in the 
assembling. But with all of it on the board at one time, 
the teacher may ask, “Is her and I correct? Is It is me 
correct?” etc. Some pupils will know; others will have 
forgotten. Then the lesson will be well introduced by the 
teacher’s explaining that to-day’s lesson gives a rule for 
deciding which form is correct, so that the class may know 
and will not have to remember mechanically. 
Some people object to putting incorrect forms on the 
board. This is wise in the language class, but there is no 
danger in the grammar class because at that time the rule 
for correcting is to be studied. 
Just as fast as we can make pupils ashamed of them- 
selves for making errors, we may hope for improvement; 
and in causing this shame, we may either get them to  
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 GRAMMAR 
realize that they cannot be understood, or we may fall back 
upon the decorative use of grammar—we may try to 
build up an ideal for correct speech as a means of marking 
us as educated people. 
In many communities it is hard to get children to realize 
that they ought to speak grammatically; and in some cases, 
as was mentioned above, any one, except the teacher, who 
speaks grammatically is considered “stuck up.” But in 
spite of these handicaps, the teacher who can himself speak 
grammatically (and I have heard in teachers’ meetings some 
of the most ungrammatical language I have ever encoun- 
tered anywhere) should strive persistently and patiently 
and enthusiastically to set up ideals for correct speech. 
This he does in language work. As a motive for grammar 
study he uses it when the pupils are looking for the rule 
that determines the correct form in any given situation. 
Summary. Pupils do not like grammar because the teacher 
goes into the subject too deeply. If immediate interest is not 
present, appeal may be made to generic values, such as grades 
and detention, or a specific need may be aroused by making the 
pupils conscious of the errors in their written and spoken langu&ge. 
Every effort should be made to utilize this last method; and when 
it fails, recourse may be had to generic values. 
Correlation. All that has been said about either the func- 
tion of grammar, or the methods of arousing a need for it, 
implies that correlation is advantageous and necessary. 
The standard by which we judge one’s hold upon grammar 
is the ability to speak grammatically in the composition, 
history, geography, and arithmetic classes. The study of 
grammar avails nothing apart from correlation with these 
subjects. Every lesson is a language lesson and, after 
grammar is studied, every lesson is a grammar lesson. 
There is a sort of correlation, however, that is disastrous. 
There are teachers who make a correlation with literature 
by having the pupils use the literature selections as gram- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  LEARNING GRAMMAR 115 
mar exercises. The most beautiful poem in the language 
becomes for these people nothing more than a series of 
grammatical forms to be parsed and analyzed. Now this 
is criminal. Only under one condition may grammar be 
correlated with literature; that is, when the meaning of 
an abstruse passage will be made clear by analysis, and 
this need does not present itself very often.

3. Learning Grammar 
Grammar consists of a series of rules and definitions. 
This makes it a good subject for the inductive method — 
a method not always used in teaching grammar. In fact, 
it is more common to use the other method. 
Telling. One of the commonest methods of teaching 
grammar is as follows: The topic is the definition of the 
adjective as a word that makes the meaning of the noun 
more exact. 
Teacher. I have put these sentences on the blackboard: 
The largest green book is on the table. 
Alfred was the greatest king of England. 
The words largest, green, greatest, are called adjectives, because 
they modify a noun, or make its meaning more exact. Now what 
part of speech is largest? 
+ Answer. An adjective. 
T. Why? A. Because it modifies the noun book. 
The other words having been taken up in the same way, 
the teacher gives new sentences containing adjectives, and 
has the pupils pick out the adjectives and parse them. 
It is to be noted here that the teacher gives the definition 
to the pupils and then drills them upon it until they have 
it fully memorized. 
The Inductive Method. There is, however, another way 
in which we may approach this subject; namely, by the 
inductive method. ‘This method has the advantage of
-P-A-G-E-132
116 GRAMMAR 
  helping the pupils to find out the rule for themselves 
instead of depending upon the teacher for it. The teacher 
does not tell the pupils, “These are adjectives because they 
modify nouns.” Instead, by means of suggestive ques- 
tions, she guides them in their thinking until they are able 
to tell her the function of the words. 
This method is called inductive, because by it a definition 
or rule is discovered by studying some particular cases to 
which the rule applies. This is the common characteristic 
of the inductive method. For instance, I wonder what the 
Japanese are like. If I use induction, I study a large 
number of Japanese men and women (particulars) and by 
comparing all these I draw the generalization, perhaps, 
that the Japanese are a courteous race. There are three 
steps — presentation of particulars, comparison, and gen- 
eralization. One always finds these three steps in induction. 
Now if we apply this to grammar, we may, in like 
manner, by presenting particular cases, draw from them 
the rules or definitions for ourselves. 
The first thing to do is to decide on the definition to be 
taught and the exact words that are to be used in it. Let 
us suppose that it is this: 
A pronoun is a-'word that stands for a noun. 
The next thing is to decide what the pupils already 
know and what they will have to be told. They do not 
know the word pronoun, but they know the meaning of all 
the rest of the definition. 
Next let us proceed to have them find this rule for them- 
selves with as little help from us as possible, remembering 
that if we use induction they must find the rule by con- 
sidering particular cases of nouns and pronouns. The 
teacher may do this by putting on the board a snenepin of 
sentences, such as these: 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  
LEARNING GRAMMAR uz 
1. Mary went home, but Mary returned later. 
2. I respect the man, but I fear the man. 
8. John priced the auto, but did not buy the auto. 
When this has been done, the lesson proceeds as follows: 
4. Teacher. Read these sentences. Do they sound right? 
What changes would you make? Answer. Change Mary to she; 
the man to him; and the auto to i. 
The teacher does this on the board by drawing a line 
through each noun and writing the pronoun above. 
'. What part of speech is Mary? A. A noun. 
Man? A. A noun. 
Auto? A. A noun. 
. What does she do? A. It stands for the noun Mary. 
What does him do? A. It stands for the noun man. 
What does it do? A. It stands for the noun auto. 
. What does each of the words she, him, anditdo? A. Each 
is a word that stands for a noun. 
The teacher then writes on the board, is a word that stands 
for a noun. MOOD NAN 
PREPS NSPS AGNES 
10. 
11. 
12. T. Such words are called pronouns. 
The teacher then writes the word pronoun on the board. 
13. T. Whatisapronoun? A. A pronoun isa word that stands 
for a noun. 
Then follows the drill. 
A word or two will suffice to explain a few points. Num- 
bers 1 to 10 all deal with presentation, or the examination 
of the three particular cases. The question in number 11 
leads the pupils to make a comparison; and the answer to 
number 11 is the generalization. Numbers 12 and 13 com- 
plete the generalization. 
Note that the only thing told the pupils by the teacher 
is the word pronoun. All the rest is worked out by the 
pupils themselves. Note also that in numbers 8, 9, and 
10 the teacher accepts answers that are almost identical in 
form with the generalization, number 11. If this is done 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 GRAMMAR 
in each case in the presentation, it makes comparison and 
generalization easier. 
The inductive method is used only where rules, defini- 
tions, or principles are to be studied, and where the teacher 
prefers to have the pupil discover these for themselves, 
rather than to tell them outright. It is used by good 
teachers frequently when there is time and the rule is not 
too difficult to discover. All young teachers should experi- 
ment with this method to see how often they can use it 
successfully. 
The Developing Method. In the lesson on the pronoun 
just given, we illustrated both the inductive method and 
the developing method. “Inductive method” is the term 
applied to the process of discovering general facts by ob- 
serving and studying particular cases. The term, developing 
method, is applied to the method of questioning by which the 
teacher, telling only as much as is thought advisable, leads 
the pupils to discover things for themselves. In theforego- 
ing lesson nothing was told except the name of the pronoun, 
which could not be drawn from the pupils by questioning. 
Good judgment has to be used in deciding what should 
be developed and what told outright. It is much better 
to develop and cover less ground than to tell and cover too 
much, because that which is developed is remembered 
longer and understood better than that which is told. 
Young teachers, instead of telling everything, should, as 
we have just said, experiment a little to see how well and 
how frequently they can develop a lesson. The rate at 
which such teachers gain skill in developing and using 
questions is surprisingly rapid. 
Summary. The inductive method should be used in grammar 
to allow pupils to discover the rules and definitions by studying 
particular cases. The teacher should use the developing method in 
order to have the pupils discover as much as possible for themselves 
without the necessity of the teacher’s telling them everything.
-P-A-G-E-135
  LEARNING GRAMMAR 119 
Drill. It is necessary to learn grammar very thoroughly. 
The reason for this may be explained by an illustration. 
For instance, I may start the sentence, “I don’t know,” 
and then stop because I wish to say either “I don’t know 
who you are talking about,” or, “I don’t know whom you 
are talking about.”’ Now, since I am anxious to finish my 
sentence at once because I am taking part in an interesting 
conversation, if grammar is to be of any use to me, I must 
make my decision as rapidly as Ican think. IfI cannot, then 
the rule is useless, for the opportunity of using it has passed. 
Consequently, the end of all parsing must be rapid oral 
parsing. Analysis is of little use to a person except as a 
means to parsing. Written analysis and written parsing 
are simply means by which to make oral parsing better. 
And just as in arithmetic or, even more than in arithmetic, 
it is necessary to make great use of rapid oral arithmetic, 
so in grammar the end of all effort is automatic parsing so 
rapid in speed that we can parse as we need to in the hurry 
and bustle of a flowing sentence. 
I am one of those who believe that all definitions in 
grammar that are worth learning are worth memorizing 
well. For we memorize things under two conditions: 
first, when the thing memorized is to be used over and over 
again; and second, when it is put into better words than 
those improvised by the user. With reference to the first, 
we have decided that we would teach in grammar only 
those things which are important; and in connection with 
the second, it is evident to one who examines these defi- 
nitions with care that they have been put into words 
carefully chosen, each word meaning something definite 
and no word superfluous, the whole idea being much more 
accurately stated by the author than it could be by an 
eighth-grade pupil. For both these reasons, therefore, it 
is wise to have definitions memorized.
-P-A-G-E-136
120 GRAMMAR 
The method of memorizing is the same as already out- 
lined. First, be sure that the pupils understand the 
definition; and second, have attentive repetition till it 
becomes automatic. 
Application. At the same time that the memorizing is 
going on, the rule or definition should be used in every 
available place. That is, it should be applied as well as 
drilled upon. The term drill means the repetition of the 
same thing over and over in exactly the same way. Appli- 
cation means the doing of a thing in different ways. Thus, 
for instance, we drill upon jumping if we stand in a spot 
and jump over and over again from the same place; but we 
apply jumping if, as we go about our business, we jump 
over a fence, across a stream, up a bank, and down a hill- 
side. These are examples of applied jumping, since the 
same thing is done in many different situations. 
In the case of grammar, we drill upon the pronoun 
when we say over and over again, “A pronoun is a word 
that stands for a noun.” We apply the definition when we 
study pronouns in many different sentences. 
In an ordinary grammar lesson, there are four different 
places in which applications may be made. 
First, as after question 13 given above, application to the 
sentences already used in the lesson from which the defini- 
tion was developed may be made as follows: 
Teacher. What part of speech is she in sentence number 1? 
Answer. A pronoun. 
T. Why? A. Because it stands for a noun. 
T. In sentence number 2, what part of speech is him? A. A 
pronoun. 
T. Why? A. Because it stands for a noun, etc. 
The reader will note that by asking the question Why? 
the teacher elicits a repetition of the definition, and drill is 
secured. The question Why? also makes the pupils think
-P-A-G-E-137
LEARNING GRAMMAR 121 
and enables the teacher to determine whether they are 
getting at the facts or are guessing. 
Second. Other simple sentences containing pronouns of 
increasing difficulty should be placed on the board, or ex- 
amples may be selected carefully from the text. The 
teacher should be careful to see that the examples given 
are not too difficult, especially at first. Such sentences 
may be chosen as: “Find John and ask him to come to me.” 
The same sort of exercise may be given as above, except 
that it may be made slightly more difficult by the teacher’s 
saying, “Are there any pronouns in the sentence?” and 
getting the answer “‘Yes”’; following this by the question, 
“What are they?” and getting from the children the 
answer “Him and me.” Above, the teacher asked the 
part of speech of the pronouns after picking them out. 
Here, the pupils both pick them out and parse them. 
As a modification of this exercise, the pupils should be 
asked to write down a number of sentences, found in read- 
ing or used by classmates, in which pronouns occur. The 
process of making up sentences is rather valueless, because 
the sentences become too formal and too much alike. 
Third. After the grammar lesson is over and all the seat 
study on the pronoun has been done, the teacher should use 
the children’s knowledge of the pronoun whenever error 
arises in their oral or written speech. Here we have the 
crucial application. All the rest of the drill and study on 
grammar is merely preparatory to this application. Gram- 
mar is merely the servant of language and is not of much 
value in the grades except as an aid to speaking correctly. 
Fourth. Occasionally in the textbooks in geography, 
history, and literature, parsing and analysis may be used 
when there is likelihood of their making the meaning 
clearer. But such applications should be made under no 
other circumstances.
-P-A-G-E-138
    122 GRAMMAR 
Summary. Each definition should be thoroughly memorized. 
Application of all rules and definitions should be sought in the 
speech of the children in all classes; and, as preparation and aid 
in this, simple exercises containing the facts defined should be 
worked over at the time the definition is learned. 
Assignments. Two plans are followed in making assign- 
ments in grammar. The teacher may assign the next 
lesson in grammar — for example, the adjective — and ex- 
pect the children to learn its definition out of the book. 
Or the teacher may lay down a rule that he will teach all 
definitions and rules in class, and will assign for home study 
exercises upon these definitions. Of these two, the latter 
is always preferable; for if the pupil learns the definition 
out of the book, he does not discover it for himself. It is 
told to him outright. 
The former method is used widely by poor teachers. 
They say, “Study the adjective for to-morrow,” and in the 
next day’s recitation they quiz the pupils to see how well 
they have learned it. The latter method, which develops 
the definition in class, requires an assignment like this: 
“(1) Memorize the definition of the adjective. (2) Parse 
all the adjectives in these sentences.” This is called a 
review assignment, while the other is called an advance 
assignment. So in grammar the assignments should al- 
ways be review and not advance assignments, because the 
pupils will understand the definitions much better if they 
are developed in class. 
Study. The study of grammar in class has been discussed. 
The inductive and developing methods should be used as 
much as possible. The seat study and the home study are 
very simple, because the teacher sets the assignment quite 
definitely when she asks the children (1) to parse the ad- 
jectives in a group of sentences that she may have written 
on the board, and (2) to select ten sentences containing 
adjectives from conversation and books, and to underline
-P-A-G-E-139
    
LEARNING GRAMMAR 123 
the adjectives. These and other assignment questions are 
quite definite, and the pupil should have no trouble in 
working with them. 
It is a good plan to allow pupils of equal ability to study 
together, provided they do not disturb the room too greatly. 
By way of objection it is claimed that this practice en- 
courages one pupil to lean upon another. This can be 
obviated, however, by making leaners work alone, or by 
setting two leaners to work together. In support of the 
plan it is urged that study is much more joyous, that good 
students stimulate each other, and that much more ground 
can thus be covered. The teacher in allowing it should use 
good judgment, and if any combination is harmful it should 
be disbanded. Good examples of pupils’ working together 
in socialized recitation may be found in Scott and in 
McGregor, references to which are made at the end of the 
chapter. 
Alternation. It seems to be practicable to alternate gram- 
mar in the seventh and eighth grades, in one year teaching 
the parts of speech and in the other analysis. However, a 
better plan is the one already suggested, to teach grammar 
only in the eighth grade, and then there will be no need for 
alternation. Otherwise, there should be a separate class 
for each grade.

CLASS QUESTIONS 
1. What difference will it make in your teaching whether you believe 
in the theory that grammar is studied merely to understand the 
sentence, or in the theory that grammar is studied to help people to 
speak correctly? 
2. Give five examples of cases in which a meaning was misunderstood 
because expressed ungrammatically. 
8. Give five examples in which, though the form was ungrammatical, 
the meaning was clear. Was the meaning just as clear to you as 
though it had been expressed grammatically? 
4. What do you think are the most effective incentives to move boys 
to study grammar? Are they the best?

details to illustrate the attitude. 
8. How can the timidity of pupils in using correct forms at home be 
overcome? 
9. Make an outline for all the parts of speech similar to the one made

CHAPTER V 
READING 
1. The Art of Reading 
Function. Reading is the fifth member of the language 
group of which the other four members are spelling, writing, 
composition, and grammar. We have seen that in carry- 
ing out the major function of communicating ideas each of 
these others plays its own specific part. In composition 
we are concerned with expressing our ideas through words 
in sentences and paragraphs. Grammar makes its con- 
tribution in revealing to us the rules according to which 
the words are accurately placed in sentences, while in spell- 
ing we are concerned with the order of letters in words and 
in penmanship with the written form of letters and words. 
All of these deal with letters and words and sentences, but 
reading starts with written or printed words and is con- 
cerned with the ideas that lie behind them. 
Reading is, of course, very important. If a man cannot 
read he is dependent for his information upon what he 
happens to learn, upon what he sees, and upon what others 
tell him. Without the ability to read he is in the hands 
of the people with whom he associates. If the people who 
are around him are ignorant, he must remain ignorant with 
them. On the other hand, if he can read he is able, through 
the medium of newspapers and-books, to gain ideas from 
all parts of the earth and from all the writing of all the 
ages. He thus becomes independent of his neighbors. 
By the simple device of putting some odd-looking signs 
upon paper it is possible to record facts and ideas so that
-P-A-G-E-143
  
  THE ART OF READING 127 
every person who knows what is meant by each of these 
signs can look at them and know exactly what the maker 
of the signs wished to say. The business of reading is to 
learn what these forms mean and with this knowledge as a 
basis to discover the ideas in the writer’s mind. And not 
only is the reader able to discover the writer’s ideas, but if 
he wishes to do so he can express these ideas to other 
people through what is known as oral reading. In this 
case he gathers the author’s meaning from the printed page 
and expresses it aloud to an audience in the exact words of 
the writer. So, reading consists of two chief divisions — 
the securing of the author’s idea, which is called silent 
reading, and the expressing of the idea in the author’s 
words, which is oral reading, as has just been said. 
Summary. The function of reading is to interpret written words 
and to express their meaning to an audience. The first phrase, 
“to interpret written words,” refers to silent reading. Both 
phrases taken together describe oral reading. 
The Reading Process. When the reading process is ana- 
lyzed it is found to consist of five divisions. First, there 
is the author’s experience. He had something to say. This 
may be very simple information, as, “I was warm yester- 
day”; it may be a command, as, “On receipt of this come 
home,” or it may be very complex and full of feeling, as, 
John’s description of the Death on the Cross. But in any 
case the author knows and feels something that he puts 
into words. 
The writer, when he is about to put his experience into 
writing organizes it according to the rules of language. 
He may throw it into the form of exposition, in which case 
he organizes his points so as to present them to the reader 
as he sees them and if he does this well his organization can 
be easily outlined. On the other hand, he may throw it 
into the form of a narrative, in which case he organizes it  
-P-A-G-E-144
128 READING 
according to the laws and rules of that part of language 
which deals with narration and has an eye to climax and 
conclusion. 
Second, we have a series of symbols in which the writer 
dresses his experience, whatever it may be. In this country 
we have inherited an alphabet consisting of twenty-six 
letters which are combined into what are called words. 
Other nations and civilizations may use other forms. For 
instance, the Chinese have a very large literature which 
can be read but they have no alphabet. The ancient 
Egyptians used hieroglyphs, but America, the European 
nations, and many other peoples utilize the alphabet which 
we use as the basis of their written language. 
The chief business of primary reading as you shall see 
later is to learn these symbols so that, having learned 
them, we may use them as tools in finding out what others 
have to say. 
Third, when the reader has mastered these symbols his 
next task is that of building up in his experience the same 
experience that the writer had when he wrote. If the 
author of the letter writes the following expression, “I was 
warm yesterday,” the reader needs to know each of these 
symbols and in addition get their meaning so that he will 
understand the experience for which the whole sentence 
stands. When Shakespeare wrote The Merchant of Venice 
he lived in his imagination the experience that he put upon 
paper, and when I read The Merchant of Venice with under- 
standing I relive the experience of Shakespeare when he 
wrote the play, as nearly as one individual can relive the 
experience of another. This, of course, is often hard to do 
because the writer may have been very emotional whereas 
the reader may be almost without emotion. The writer 
may feel like weeping or laughing as he writes while the 
reader may get the idea but miss the intensity of feeling

THE ART OF READING 129 
of either joy or sorrow, but in such cases the reading is not 
of first quality. Such a reader could never become an 
actor. 
Fourth, after the reader has learned the meaning and has 
built up in himself the experience of the writer, he utters this 
meaning aloud. This naturally involves the vocal organs 
and the whole speaking apparatus, tongue, teeth, palate, 
vocal cords, lungs, and diaphragm. A defect in any one of 
| these may upset the reading process. For instance, a cleft 
palate or diseased vocal cords or the absence of the tongue 
might destroy the possibility of intelligible speech. 
The book in my hand, typical of most books on the sub- 
ject, deals with the use of the nostrils, abdomen, and 
mouth, the active and passive chest, waist, neck and 
throat movements, with breathing and the vocal cords. 
While these overlap, they indicate the extent to which the 
expert reader needs to use the vocal organs. The ability 
to use them well is the chief characteristic that differen- 
tiates the fine reader from the amateur. 
Most people do not use their vocal organs with maximum 
effectiveness. They frequently do not breathe correctly 
and often do not articulate well. Sometimes “correct” 
reading is secured at the expense of the writer’s meaning. 
That is to say, the expert reader is frequently so trained 
that he gives more attention to his method of delivery than 
to what he is saying. However, such a fault is not a 
common one in schools, where too little rather than too 
much attention is paid to the mechanics of oral reading. 
Fifth, and finally, there is an audience to be read to. 
After the reader has secured the writer’s ideas for himself, 
he may then, in the complete act of reading, use his vocal 
apparatus in reading the written words to others. Here his 
object is to build up in the audience the experience which 
he thinks the author had. In good oral reading three  
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 READING 
people have as nearly identical experiences as possible — 
the author had the experience which he wrote down, the 
reader gets this experience as nearly identical with the 
author’s experience as is possible, and in oral reading the 
end is secured when the audience gets an experience that 
is as nearly identical with that of the author and reader as 
is possible. 
Of course the listener might read the author’s ideas for 
himself, and many prefer to do so, but there is one ad- 
vantage in listening to a good reader. He often under- 
stands better than the audience what the author means 
and feels and by the inflection of his voice is able to help 
his hearers to appreciate the author’s ideas more fully than 
would be the case if the listener merely read non-inflected 
printed words for himself. 
The complete act of reading, composed of these five 
factors, is called oral reading. Sometimes the person may 
read aloud to himself, but that is not oral reading in the 
strict sense, since there is no audience. ‘The first three 
steps constitute the act of silent reading in which the reader 
gets the idea of the writer and rebuilds in himself the expe- 
rience that was present when the material was written. 
Summary. Reading involves five factors: (1) an experience in 
the mind of the writer, which he organizes; (2) a series of words 
into which he translates the experience; (3) a reader who deciphers 
the word symbols and rebuilds in himself the experience of the 
writer; (4) vocal organs to be used by the reader who has already 
deciphered the symbols and reproduced the experience of the 
writer and (5) an audience to which the reader reads the experience 
so that the audience also may reproduce in itself the experience of 
the author. 
Qualities of Good Reading. Good reading possesses six 
qualities. (1) The reader must have a sympathetic under- 
standing of what the author writes. He must not only 
understand his ideas, but he must put himself into sympathy
-P-A-G-E-147
  
THE ART OF READING 131 
with the author and try to see the matter from his point of 
view. He must not be critical of what the author says. 
His first duty is to try by all means possible to understand 
him and his point of view. Later he may differ from the 
author and criticize his point of view, but when he does this 
he is not “reading.” He is arguing and discussing. (2) 
Reading must be carried on with the greatest possible 
speed that can be secured without detriment to under- 
standing or comprehension of what the writer is saying. 
If one reads very slowly and with great difficulty, he wastes 
time and often becomes completely discouraged so that he 
ceases to read as much as he should. (8) The reader 
should, in the process of understanding the author, recog- 
nize what the author says so as to discover his main points, 
his lines of argument, and his method of building up his 
ease. (4) After he has gotten the ideas of the author and 
has organized them as well as is necessary, he should retain 
what he has read so that when he wishes to use it at some 
later time he will find it available for use in his memory. 
If the reader does not train his memory to retain what he 
reads he gets little of permanent value out of it. If, after 
reading a book, he is unable to recall the incidents, facts, 
and major points of the author, his time has been largely 
wasted. (5) In oral reading the reader must have the 
desire to interest his audience. [If this interest is not 
present he merely “says words.” If, on the other hand, he 
wishes to interest his audience he will be careful to speak 
clearly and effectively. (6) In reading to an audience he 
should have a good control of the mechanics of oral read- 
ing. His enunciation should be distinct, and his rate of 
reading should not be too fast for the audience to grasp 
the meaning nor so slow as to permit their minds to run 
ahead of what he is saying. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. In conformity with the fore-
-P-A-G-E-148
pe er ee ee 
132 READING 
going, the teacher has clearly four objectives. In the first 
place, he will seek to develop a love of reading, both oral 
and silent. ‘The most important thing that the teacher 
can do for children during the eight years of the elementary 
school, more important than a knowledge of arithmetic, 
geography, or history, is the development of a love for 
reading. If children like to read they can, if worst comes 
to worst, gain their own knowledge of history or geography, 
while, on the other hand, if they do not like to read they 
will become really illiterate when they leave school. They 
will not gain ideas from books and newspapers but will 
fall back to the semi-primitive condition where they secure 
whatever ideas they do obtain from the people with whom 
they happen to associate. The government census shows 
that we have five per cent of illiterates, and by the term 
“illiterate” is meant people who are unable to read; but 
probably twenty per cent of the people of the nation, in 
addition to this five per cent, who cannot read at all, do not 
actually read about any of the important topics of the day. 
Many people who are not so-called illiterates never look at 
a newspaper, some merely read the local happenings and 
some glance merely at the headlines and the comic sections. 
If, however, a teacher has instilled in children while in 
school a love of reading, and facility for reading rapidly, all 
this difficulty will be cured and the illiterates will be 
confined to the census figures. 
Not only should the teacher develop a love for silent 
reading. He should train the children to enjoy reading 
"aloud to other people. If this occurs it will be a common 
spectacle to see the children in the home reading to other 
members of the family small or important items, jokes, 
interesting incidents that they run across in their reading, 
etc. There is no more powerful factor in the development 
of a pleasant spirit in the home than the sharing of the  
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE ART OF READING 133 
interesting things that one is reading with the other mem- 
bers of the family. In the second place, it is necessary for 
the children to attain a satisfactory rate of speed in reading. 
If children read slowly they will not enjoy it, for they will 
pick the line of least resistance and cease reading except 
under compulsion, which of course disappears when they 
leave school. In the third place, it is necessary for the 
teacher to develop the mechanics of silent reading such as 
comprehension of what the author says, the organization 
of the material to find its important points, and the re- 
tention of what they learn. It is quite clear, therefore, 
that silent reading is used more outside of the reading 
period than inside. When a child studies geography, his- 
tory, physiology, or any other subject, he is reading silently 
and can be taught in connection with those subjects as 
well as in the reading period, how to understand, organize, 
and retain what he reads. In the fourth place, and finally, 
it is the teacher’s duty to instruct the children in the me- 
chanics of oral reading. While it must be admitted that 
silent reading is much more important than oral reading 
because the occasions on which oral reading is used are 
very much fewer in number, yet the habit of oral reading 
is so important in developing good fellowship and intel- 
ligence that it cannot be overlooked. In developing skill 
in the mechanics of oral reading, it is of fundamental im- 
portance that the children get the idea that they are reading 
to an audience whom it is necessary for them to interest. 
With this clearly in mind, they will have a tendency to read 
intelligently and to overcome the defects in oral reading 
which will be mentioned later. 
Summary. The teacher has four objectives in the teaching of 
reading. These are: (1) the development of a love of silent and 
oral reading, (2) speed in reading, (3) comprehension, organiza- 
tion, and retention of what is read, and (4) an adequate skill in 
the mechanics of oral reading.
-P-A-G-E-150
  134 READING 
Subject-Matter. The problem of selecting subject- 
matter in reading and placing it in the proper grades is 
quite different from the problem of selecting subject- 
matter in handwriting or spelling. In handwriting there 
is no problem of selection. We teach all of the twenty-six 
letters and the punctuation marks. In spelling we know 
quite definitely the common words that children and adults 
use in writing, but the case is quite different in reading. 
There are thousands of newspapers and magazines and 
hundreds of thousands of books from which the children 
may select, but we do not have many specific studies which 
show us exactly what the children should be given to read. 
They have, of course, to read the textbooks in all the 
subjects, but outside of that we have to depend upon 
general principles rather than upon specific facts, which are, 
of course, more helpful than the general principles. 
Since we are dependent upon general principles it would 
be well to state four of them which should guide us in our 
selection of material to read. In the first place, the material 
should be interesting. Children should be “exposed to” 
a wide variety of reading, and when this is done, teachers 
soon learn which things are, in general, most interesting to 
children of certain grades and which are not. The teacher 
will further try to make the material as interesting as 
possible to them. But if he is a good teacher and still 
cannot develop interest the probabilities are that in the 
reading class the material should be left out or treated 
lightly with succeeding classes. The question of interest 
will be discussed more fully later. In the second place, 
reading should be graded on the basis of difficulty. Gen- 
erally speaking, it is unwise for children to read material 
that is beyond their abilities because it destroys interest. 
It is a mistake, of course, to choose selections which are 
too easy, because then the children have no opportunity to 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
THE ART OF READING 185 
increase their powers of reading. In each lesson there 
should be a nice balance between easy material and diffi- 
cult material. Such a balance is not preserved if in the 
fifth grade the selection is so difficult that the children do 
not know the meanings of half of the words. If we were 
to set an arbitrary standard we might say that in a reading 
lesson not more than one-half dozen quite unfamiliar words 
to a page should be present. If the teacher looks over the 
reading lessons with the class in mind he will find that he 
will often have to change the order of lessons in the reader. 
During the early part of the term he will teach the easy 
lessons and will leave the very difficult ones for the end of 
the year. In the selection of outside reading for children 
he will be very careful to give them easy reading material. 
In the third place, material should be selected on the basis 
of value. This means, briefly, that the artistic form should 
be good. It is better to have children read Treasure 
Island than “Nick” Carter because Treasure Island is 
better written. Much can be done to develop the chil- 
dren’s interest in good literature rather than uncouth and 
trashy material. Fortunately most of the material that is 
prepared for children in school readers and school books is 
reasonably good and the teacher need not be greatly con- 
cerned about the lack of value of the material which is 
easily available for the children. Jn the fourth place, the 
supply of reading material should be abundant and varied. 
Children “learn to read by reading.” It is much better to 
have a child read the basic text until he knows it and add 
to that three other books than to have him read the basic 
text three times more. This procedure is good partly be- 
cause of interest—the textbook grows monotonous—and 
partly because it gives more practice in recognition of other 
words and ideas and adds to his fund of information. The 
sources from which to obtain this material are many and
-P-A-G-E-152
    136 READING 
diverse. The school library should contain single or 
duplicate copies of a number of other readers. It should 
have a few library books selected from such reading lists 
as are found in Stone and Germane, in the references at the 
end of this chapter. Magazines may also be brought to 
the school for reading. Newspapers can be used in school 
and at home. Pamphlets, simply written, on civics and 
industrial activities can be obtained by the teacher and it 
is frequently wise to provide for the children in the upper 
grades copies of textbooks in history, physiology, etc., 
written by other authors than the writer of the basic text. 
Summary. The subject-matter for oral and silent reading 
should be selected upon the basis of interest, difficulty, and value. 
Abundant opportunity should be given for wide reading so that 
the children may gain facility in getting information from the 
printed text. 
Stages of Development. Children develop by stages, 
during which their interests and abilities are profoundly 
changed. 
That children differ from adults is a matter of common 
experience. That their interests change from year to year 
has been observed by everybody. That they study with 
the greatest success those things which are most interesting 
to them is a fundamental pedagogical doctrine. 
Because of this, attempts have been made to mark off 
the children’s interests by stages. If we could only learn 
what interests are strongest in each grade we should have 
an easy time getting the children to work hard and intel- 
ligently. We should not want to mollycoddle them, but 
we could avoid teaching things of no possible interest to 
them. But unfortunately, up to date no one has made a 
really unassailable classification. The attempts to discover 
what interests children in each grade up to adolescence 
have not been successful, and the beginning teacher can 
 
-P-A-G-E-153

do little more than follow the course of study as outlined 
by the authors of textbooks or the superintendents of in- 
struction. 
However, there has been one particular attempt at 
dividing the children’s lives into stages that should be 
described because of its historical importance. This is 
known as the recapitulation theory, which holds that 
every one from conception to maturity passes through the 
same stages as has the race from the beginning of life in 
the geological ages until now. It has been observed that 
the fetus of any animal before birth passes through the 
lower orders, in a superficial way at least. For instance, 
the human embryo in one stage before birth cannot be 
distinguished superficially from the fetus of a fish, and 
later of a dog. Man has evolved through these stages in 
millions of years and each individual child passes through 
the same stages. But a child makes the passage with ex- 
treme rapidity. Likewise, the upholders of this doctrine 
claim that just as the race passed through the tree-dwelling, 
cave-dwelling, hunting, pastoral, and agricultural stages, 
so each child after birth passes through the same stages 
except that he does it in a few years instead of a few hun- 
dred thousands of years, as has been the case with the 
race. 
The pedagogical implication of this theory is that children 
should be taught the arts of each of these stages while 
they are in them. We are told that they should hunt and 
make bows and arrows, slings and cross-bows, while in the 
hunting stage. They should be allowed to live in caves, 
work with skins, make stone implements, and experiment 
with fire in the cave-dwelling stage. Each of these stages 
should be fitted with the appropriate training. 
As a theory this will not hold with any exactness. We 
cannot see these stages in children very clearly and they
-P-A-G-E-154
    138 READING 
often skip them completely. But as a source of suggestion 
for making school work more simple and letting the children 
do primitive things it has been illuminating and useful, for 
undoubtedly we have kept children in school too close to 
books and seatwork and have not given them the oppor- 
tunity to work with a wider variety of interesting things. 
When we discuss the manual arts I shall take pleasure in 
giving many illustrations of how the appeal to the con- 
structive impulses and to the delight which children find in 
the use of primitive implements is of great value in the 
grades. Because of the fact that there is so much confusion 
about the correct view to take of the stages of childhood 
and the characteristics of each stage, the teacher has to rely 
largely upon the printed course of study in the textbooks, 
and supplement this by his own knowledge of children. 
He knows for instance that little children love simple 
stories of action, Mother Goose rhymes, and nonsense 
verses, and that later they become tired of these and 
become interested in fairy stories, but for only a few years, 
and that after this the growing boy becomes absorbed in 
the stories of adventure. Following this occurs a period 
of more earnest endeavor when the child enjoys reading the 
mature ideas of adults. In all of this there is a progressive 
advance, stage by stage, but it is quite impossible to say 
at what age, either chronologically, mentally, or physically, 
these interests appear. Therefore, I repeat, the inexpe- 
rienced teacher is wise to follow the text until he finds from 
experience that the course of study may be modified to 
advantage for the benefit of the individual class. 
Summary. The course of study in reading should follow in 
broad outline the stages of development of the children con- 
cerned. But since there is no consensus of opinion upon the time 
at which the stages occur, the inexperienced teacher has to depend 
upon the course of study that is given him and upon that ripen- 
ing judgment which comes to him from dealing with children.
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  THE ART OF READING 139 
Interest. There are three important facts to be borne in 
mind in the development of interest in reading. In the 
first place, the teacher depends more fully upon the im- 
mediate interests of children in this subject than in any 
other. It is the children’s right to expect to study what 
they like in this subject. Some of the things that they 
seem to like have just been mentioned in the illustrations 
of the different stages of development, but no complete 
classification has been made. Supplementary to the fore- 
going list of things we may mention, however, the fact that 
in the intermediate grades they are fond of stories of danger, 
of achievement against odds, and of sports. They enjoy 
the experience of hero-worship and they fortunately prefer 
material which embodies high ideals. Jn the second place, 
good teaching is an important factor in the development of 
interest. A teacher who enjoys reading himself and enjoys 
the experience of getting children to like it is more suc- 
cessful than one who is not interested in reading. Two 
young women were looking for a Christmas present for a 
third. One said to the other, “Let ’s get Mamie a book,” 
and the other replied, ““No, Mamie has a book.” Quite 
clearly Mamie would not make a good teacher of reading. 
She has no interest in the subject. But in addition, the 
teacher needs to see that the children read well, and this 
leads us to the third factor in securing interest. This is 
the factor of speed, which has been so frequently men- 
tioned. Very frequently it is observed that a child who 
will not read except as a task takes on the keenest interest 
in reading when his rate of reading has been brought up to 
the level which indicates that he is no longer having trouble 
with his reading. The methods of improving speed will be 
discussed in a later section. 
Standards. The standards of speed in silent reading can 
be quite definitely stated because they have been worked 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  
140 READING 
out with considerable care. We shall reproduce the stand- 
ard set up by Professor Gray. In the reading of simple 
material of the narrative type, adapted in content and 
vocabulary to the grades in which the tests are given, the 
children of the class should on the average reach the 
following standards: 
  
GRADES 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
  
No. of Words 
per Minute | 90 | 138 | 180 | 204 | 216 | 228 | 240   
It will be noted that the increase in the rate of speed 
grows less as the children grow older. They have attained 
nearly their maximum improvement by the end of the 
sixth grade. 
The teacher can informally test out his pupils for himself 
by selecting for the grade some short story of at least 
250 words with which the children are not familiar and 
which is about right in difficulty for the grade. The 
teacher will then, with watch in hand, have the children 
start together on signal and have them stop on signal at 
the end of a minute. When they stop they will indicate 
with some inconspicuous mark the last word that they 
read. The teacher and the children may then calculate 
the number of words covered by each pupil. This gives 
roughly the rate of reading of each, and the average for the 
class can be computed and compared with the standards. 
If one wishes to give a standard test which will compare 
exactly with the Gray standards it will be necessary to 
obtain through the superintendent copies of the Gray test 
which is described in the book by Stone included in the 
reference readings at the end of the chapter. 
Tests for comprehension have been worked out and 
among these the one most widely used is the Monroe silent 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE ART OF READING 141 
reading test. However, home-made tests can be made by 
the teacher by the use of numerous devices which will be 
described in the next section. 
The foregoing standards apply to silent reading. For 
oral reading there are no specific standards as to the proper 
rate of reading. The standard is a general one. Children 
should have the attitude that they want to read so clearly 
that the audience can understand what they say, and if 
they have this attitude the rate of reading largely takes 
care of itself. The other defects in oral reading will be 
discussed in the section on that subject. 
Testing. In testing silent reading it becomes quite clear 
that children have different rates of reading in different 
subjects. The child may read stories very rapidly while 
his skill in reading geography may be very poorly developed. 
It is important that a test for speed should also be made 
to include a test for comprehension, because children 
under the impetus of reading as much as they can, fre- 
quently read so fast that they do not understand what is 
read, and this is, of course, dangerous. 
Testing the children for both speed and comprehension i is 
absolutely essential in improving the quality and rate of 
their reading. More than that, children are able by means 
of graphs and charts and practice curves to develop a keen 
interest in improving speed and quality just as we found it 
in spelling and handwriting. Over and over again it has 
been demonstrated that the teacher can transfer from his 
shoulders to the shoulders of the children the problem of 
increasing their skill in reading, if he can show them with 
quite definite exactness where they are weak and how 
much they can improve with effort. The teacher should 
no more think of giving instruction without adequate 
means for letting the children see the rate at which they 
are overcoming their specific difficulties than of teaching
-P-A-G-E-158
    142 READING 
without a textbook. This is the outstanding contribution 
of the research work that has been done in methods of 
teaching during the past five years. 
Reading Projects. It is obvious that reading may be used 
in connection with projects in other fields which require 
reading for their performance. The boy who is growing 
corn as a project in agriculture may have to do a great deal 
of reading in order to find out. how to grow corn. But 
there may be direct projects in reading. These are of two 
kinds. The first is reading for enjoyment. Whenever a 
person picks up a magazine or a book and reads it without 
its being an assigned task, he is carrying on a simple read- 
ing project. There are, of course, thousands of these in 
the ordinary course of the year’s reading. ‘This is the 
natural condition under which reading is carried on, and 
the student will not continue the reading unless he is in- 
terested in the content. In selecting projects of this 
sort the most important consideration is to get interesting 
reading material which the children peruse because they 
like it. . 
There is another type of technical reading project in 
which the children seek to improve their ability to read 
silently or orally. When pupils, by the use of graphs and 
standards seek for greater speed, comprehension, and re-: 
tention, by putting thought on methods of improvement, 
we have a technical reading project and this is very much 
worth while. If the responsibility for the improvement of 
reading can be shared by both the teacher and the pupils 
the rate of progress will be very much more rapid and the 
results will be much more effective. 
Summary. Reading is used extensively in connection with 
many projects in other fields. We utilize reading projects when * 
the children are led to read for pleasure or when they use their’ 
own initiative in an effort to improve their technique of reading.

    SILENT READING 143 
2. Silent Reading 
Function. The objective in silent reading is to get ideas 
from the printed page and it involves the four factors of 
speed, comprehension, organization, and retention. Nat- 
urally with such an objective the problem of teaching these 
four elements arises. The query is, “How can we se- 
cure speed, organization, comprehension, and retention in 
silent reading?” Upon these points the studies of the 
past five years furnish us with some very interesting 
information. 
Diagnosis. According to the point of view which we are 
developing in this book, and which is an outcome of the 
current movements in education, our first step in improving 
the ability of children to read silently is diagnosis. When 
we have discovered the difficulties that children face in 
learning to read silently and with efficiency, we have made 
an excellent start toward the curing of the defects. It is 
at once apparent, of course, that there are many different 
kinds of silent reading, dependent upon the subjects which 
are read. Some excellent silent readers of prose have 
difficulties in reading poetry, and some quite efficient 
readers of history have great difficulty in reading arithmetic. 
The problems of silent reading are not simple and, what- 
ever they may be, they have to be determined through 
diagnosis. 
Anderson and Merton have prepared the following anal- 
ysis of the errors which children made in using two silent 
reading tests. After the tests had been given they went 
over the children’s work carefully and tried to discover 
what was the cause of the mistakes which they made. 
After I have given the list I shall make some remarks 
about the significance of the items.
-P-A-G-E-160

that in paragraph 97 4 
Inability to think logically in response 
to question 91 4 
It will be observed that one third of the mistakes were 
due to meager vocabulary. This means that the children 
did not understand the words in which the tests were ex- 
pressed. Items two and four constitute another unit 
which makes up one third of the difficulties. They are 
errors of organization and indicate that children either 
were not able to pick out the central idea or were not able 
to get details. Quite significant is the fact that fourteen 
per cent of the mistakes were due to eye difficulties. This 
does not mean that children are near-sighted or far-sighted 
or have astigmatism. They may or may not have these 
difficulties, but people with perfectly normal vision as 
judged by the visional charts sometimes read only a small 
number of letters at a time. This is very well illustrated 
by photographs which have been taken of the eye while 
reading is being carried on. To the person who has not 
studied the matter it would seem that the eye glances 
smoothly and evenly across the page but this does not 
happen. What really happens is that the eye moves
-P-A-G-E-161
  SILENT READING 145 
quickly and stands still, then moves quickly again and 
stands still. These points where the movement ceases are 
called fixation points. The slow reader takes small jumps 
and many of them. The rapid reader sees more at a time. 
For instance, a rapid fourth-grade reader described by 
Judd used four fixation points in one line, seven in another, 
and six in another, while the poor reader in the same grade 
had nine in one line, ten in another, and seventeen in 
another. As a result of this defect the student not only 
reads slowly but he may miss parts of the content of what 
he is reading. 
A number of other difficulties which caused low grades 
in the foregoing tests are the following. A student may 
read word by word instead of by thought groups. Some of 
the students use vocalization and lip movements. That is 
to say, the muscles of the throat and vocal organs silently 
form the words and in some cases the lips are actually used. 
This of course makes reading very slow and must be over- 
come. Occasionally students use their fingers to follow 
the line. 
Summary. The important point is that it is necessary for the 
teacher to see just what the cause of the difficulty is as a basis for 
methods of curing the deficiency. In general, the types of diffi- 
culty that have been mentioned here in connection with speed, 
comprehension, organization, and retention are the most serious 
difficulties in silent reading.   
Interest. When we wish to increase speed, compre- 
hension, organization, or retention in silent reading, it is 
quite important that we get the interest of the children in 
the problem. This is secured by a number of methods 
which have been mentioned and some others which are of 
importance. It is quite clear that if the children are to 
have an interest in silent reading they should be exposed to 
interesting material. It is particularly important that they
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 READING 
be given easy material for practice. It is also of very great 
importance for the teacher to have an intelligent enthu- 
siasm for improvement and, finally, an appeal may be 
made to emulation and rivalry. Certainly the individual 
child should have records made of his proficiency in silent 
reading in speed, comprehension, organization, or retention, 
or, rather, in all of them, so that he can see how rapid his 
improvement is. 
Speed. In working for speed many of the errors can be 
caught. If the child is told to read rapidly the eye move- 
ments tend to increase. Lip movements tend to cease, but 
obviously direct attention must also be paid to some of 
these deficiencies. 
The best time to have speed drill in silent reading is from 
grades three to six, because by the end of Grade VI the 
rate is rather well fixed. It is interesting to note that 
speed in reading does not necessarily lower quality. There 
is a popular fallacy abroad to the effect that slow readers 
remember better, but statistics do not bear this out. On 
the whole the people who read most rapidly retain the 
most, although it is quite clear from the records that if a 
person speeds up beyond his normal rate of reading he has 
a tendency to comprehend less, but if he extends himself 
beyond the normal for some little time, the higher standard 
becomes his normal standard and his skill in comprehension 
rises. It is also apparent that in skimming — reading very 
rapidly to get at the main points in a selection — compre- 
hension and retention are not so great as where all the 
words are read. 
There are seven methods for getting speed which are 
worthy of careful attention. (1) It is quite important that 
the children should, in working for speed, get the right 
mental set. The teacher should show them from speed 
tests which they have taken that they need to read more
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  SILENT READING 147 
rapidly, or should explain the value of rapid reading, par- 
ticularly calling attention to the fact that rapid reading 
saves time. The whole matter should be talked over with 
them as a problem. By this we mean that the children 
should have all the necessary facts laid before them, should 
be told what the difficulties are, asked what can be done to 
overcome them, and finally informed of the fact that 
records will be kept to see how much they improve in 
speed. An enthusiastic attitude toward the problem is an 
absolute essential. (2) They should be given a great deal 
of practice in rapid silent reading and when this is done 
care should be taken to test them for comprehension at the 
same time. It is particularly important to notice those 
who have jumped rapidly in speed and to ask them ques- 
tions to see that they are not merely letting their eyes 
run along without any idea of what they are reading. A 
number of these methods of testing comprehension are 
mentioned in the next section. In giving these practice 
exercises children should be told to read as rapidly as 
possible, time control should be maintained by having them 
start and stop on signal, practice should not be longer than 
two minutes at a time and might preferably be one minute 
in length. The number of words read should be recorded 
and graphs may be made. The children themselves enjoy 
keeping their own individual charts. Such a chart can be 
made by using squared paper and placing the numbers of 
words along the vertical column to the left-hand side and 
the dates along the top, as in the handwriting chart on 
pages 55, 56. However, along the top, instead of using 
months, days or weeks can be used, depending upon the 
frequency of the drills. (38) Exercises should be given to 
decrease vocalization. That is, the forming of words in the 
throat or the movement of the lips should be minimized. 
In the case of lip reading the child’s attention should be
-P-A-G-E-164
148 READING 
called to the fact and he should be instructed not to move 
his lips while he is working for speed. The fact that people 
form words in their throats should be pointed out with an 
explanation of why it is important that this should not be 
done, then the ordinary speed instruction should be given. 
That is to say, the children should be told to read as rap- 
idly as possible. (4) In all the grades, but particularly in 
the lower grades, flash cards may be used. By a flash card 
is meant a card on which is placed some printing to be 
shown quickly to the students so that they may secure 
practice in rapid recognition of what is on the card. The 
teacher holds the card before the class and quickly turns 
it down while the children are asked to tell him what is on 
the card. These flash cards may contain words or phrases 
and sentences or even paragraphs, the time being modified 
according to the length of the material and care being taken 
to make the time as short as possible. (5) Easy material 
should be used in all speed work. If we are working for 
rapidity we can get it best by having material so easy that 
all the children need is to work for speed. They ought not 
to be bothered by many words in the selection which are 
too difficult for them. ‘This easy material can sometimes 
be gotten by using the readers or the other textbooks of a 
lower grade and there is no reason why material with which 
they are familiar should not be used provided allowance is 
made in the practice records which are kept. (6) Rhyth- 
mical eye movements should be induced, and training 
should be given in such movements. (7) It is very im- 
portant to use individual records and graphs. It stimulates 
rivalry among the students and especially that most 
wholesome type of rivalry between the pupil and his own 
previous record. It enlists the interest of the class as a 
wholein the effort to develop speed and makes the pupils en- 
thusiastic about seeing the class average or median riseabove 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
  SILENT READING 149 
the record of yesterday. This enthusiasm, says O’Brien, 
spreads to all the members of the class, even to the less 
ambitious; it appeals to their pride and loyalty and creates 
an esprit de corps thatis favorable to the success of the effort. 
Several other suggestive descriptions of, and directions 
for, giving lessons in silent reading which space does not 
allow us to summarize here, are found in Stone’s book 
which is listed in the references at the end of the chapter. 
Comprehension. In developing comprehension or under- 
standing of what is read the teacher has at his disposal not 
only the reading period but also the history, geography, and 
arithmetic periods. Every subject becomes a laboratory 
in working upon comprehension. Frequently children are 
poor in arithmetic because they are not able to read the 
arithmetic problem correctly. Clearly in history and geog- 
raphy the chief purpose of the study is to have the children 
understand what they read. 
The quality of the comprehension can be improved and 
several devices have been described and may be found in 
the references at the end of the chapter. 
(1) Children’s interest in getting as much as possible out 
of material from one reading should be stimulated. It isa 
well-established fact that children will comprehend what 
is in a selection much better if they know that they are to be 
held responsible. The teacher, for instance, may say, “In 
reading this material I want you not only to read rapidly 
but I shall expect you to know what you have read.” 
When the proper attitude has been developed the teacher 
may test by asking questions. These questions may be 
given orally as they usually are in any recitation, or they 
may be written down on the blackboard or mimeographed, 
if a mimeograph machine is available. As an illustration 
of this, I quote from Stone (Silent and Oral Reading, p. 176), 
for the purpose of showing certain types of questions that
-P-A-G-E-166
150 READING 
may be easily answered in writing. The advantage of 
having the answers written down lies in the fact that the 
teacher can grade each paper and determine upon the 
record for the lesson much more accurately than if he asks 
oral questions from individuals in the class.

Assignment: First read the whole selection through rapidly. 
Then read the part indicated before the question, and write the 
answer if you can. If necessary to re-read, in order to answer the 
question, do so. After you have written your answer verify it; 
that is, re-read to see if it is correct. In case you think what you 
have written is not correct, do not erase it, but put a large ques- 
tion mark at the left-hand margin. ‘The questions should be an- 
ori in your own words, and not by copying sentences from the 
ook.

(2) In other cases children, particularly in the primary 
grades, may have written directions placed on the board for 
them to read silently and follow. Such directions might 
be, “Hold up your hands,” “fold your arms,” “jump on 
one foot,” and so on. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  
SILENT READING 151 
(8) Another very interesting type of test to give is what 
is known as a completion test. This means that sentences 
may be written on the board or mimeographed, with blanks 
to be filled in with important words in what they have 
read. For instance, in a lesson on the history of the Civil 
War some completion questions might be constructed as 
follows: “The Civil War began in the year...” “It 
ended in the year...” “... ... was President of the 
United States at that time.” 
If the teacher carefully constructs blanks so as to make 
it necessary for the children to fill in the words, he can 
quickly determine after the test is given whether they have 
comprehended what they have read. This makes a very 
interesting variation from the ordinary oral question 
method in finding out what children know about what they 
have read. 
In using the completion tests the statements may be 
placed on the blackboard and the pupils be required to 
write only the words to be substituted for the blanks. If 
there are ten questions written on the board and there is 
one blank in each sentence, for Question 1 the child will 
write on his paper “1” and after it write merely the omitted 
word. The same procedure will be followed for Questions 
Nos. 2 and 3. If there are two blanks in the sentence the 
words may be placed under each other after the number of 
the question. The papers are then scored on the basis of 
the number of words that are correct, or, in cases of doubt, 
that are synonymous. If there are ten blanks, six of 
which the child gets correct, he has a score of six or sixty 
per cent. 
(4) Another type of question with which the beginning 
teacher can experiment is what is known as the true-false 
test. In this case two statements are given, one of which 
is true and the other false. For instance, Germane and
-P-A-G-E-168
  
152 READING 
Germane give the following illustration: The teacher had 
assigned to the sixth-grade geography class the reading of 
a section on New England. She then explained that she 
would read a list of twenty statements based on the assign- 
ment and that, of these statements, some were true and 
some were false. If the pupil considered a statement to be 
true, he was to make a plus sign, while if he thought it was 
false, he would make a minus sign. The teacher read these 
at a rate of one every thirty seconds. As the teacher read 
each question she gave the number, and all that the children 
did was to write the number down on the paper and put a 
plus or minus after it. The test was scored and the results 
recorded in approximately fifteen minutes. Each pupil’s 
final score consisted of the number of correct answers minus 
the number of wrong ones; thus the pupil who answered 
eighteen out of twenty correctly and two incorrectly scored 
sixteen points, or eighty per cent. A few of the questions 
prepared by the teacher will be of interest to the reader: 
(1) The New England States comprise an area greater than 
that of the Southern States. (2) Montpelier is the capital 
of Maine. (3) Most of the rivers flow north and south. 
(4) Fishing is an important industry. (5) The largest State 
is Massachusetts. (6) New England has many thriving 
cities. (7) The surface is, for the most part, rough and 
broken. (8) Harvard University is located in New Haven. 
(5) Another type of test is the recognition test. This 
will be first illustrated and then explained. Three examples 
of the recognition test are as follows: 
Pittsburgh is in: Pennsylvania New York Ohio Mas- _ 
sachusetts. 
The largest State in the Union is: California New York 
Texas Montana. 
Henry Clay was an: inventor general statesman ex- 
plorer.
-P-A-G-E-169
SILENT READING 153 
  The object of such a test is to have the children determine 
which of the statements is most nearly correct. This test 
was used quite extensively in the tests that were given to 
the soldiers in what are known as the “Army Alpha” tests. 
The test, when prepared by the teacher, may be given 
either orally or may be written on the board and the chil- 
dren asked to write down only the correct word. It 
provides a pleasant variation which interests the students 
and like the other tests which we have mentioned takes 
very little time to score. The teacher spends more time 
upon the careful preparation of the test than he needs to 
spend upon reading the answers afterward. In fact, most 
of the scoring can be done by the children themselves. It 
also makes a very pleasant variation for the teacher from 
the usual practice of reading many long papers which 
take much of her time and which do not, on the whole, test 
more accurately than these, which are so much simpler to 
grade. However, the teacher must be cautioned against 
using any one of these forms exclusively. They constitute 
what is known as “a battery of tests” and should be used 
to supplement each other during the course of the month. 
Some can better be used for one kind of material and some 
for other types, while at still other times they are introduced 
merely for variety. 
Summary. In testing comprehension, five different forms may 
be used. These are oral or written questions, true and false tests, 
completion tests, recognition tests, and the following of directions. 
Organization. In silent reading, whether carried on in 
the reading class or in connection with the other subjects of 
study, it is not sufficient for the children merely to under- 
stand what they read. It is necessary that they organize 
it and several methods are provided for drill in organiza- 
tion. First, it is again necessary to get the children in- 
terested, for the reasons mentioned over and over again.

  154 READING 
Second, the children may be asked to prepare topical out- 
lines with which every teacher is well acquainted. Stress 
must be laid upon the fact, however, that in preparing the 
topical outlines well-organized material should be used. 
This point needs to be emphasized because of the fact that 
unfortunately some of the material in the textbooks which 
children use has been very poorly organized by the author. 
Such material should be discarded when training in or- 
ganization is given. Just as in speed we work with easy 
material, so in organization we should use only material 
whose organization can be rather easily determined. Third, 
as a variation of this procedure children may sum up para- 
graphs. Such a recitation may, according to Stone, begin 
by having all the children read the unit through rather 
rapidly to get the general theme. The children may then 
be asked to select a suitable topic for each paragraph. 
‘Thereupon the class re-reads the first paragraph slowly and 
works out a topic, and so on through the unit. Children 
are also asked to discover the sentences that are most sig- 
nificant. Reading lessons of this sort should be included 
in every term’s work in the fourth, fifth, and higher grades. 
Fourth, children may be asked to make running notes on 
the selection read. This is done from the topical outline, 
in that children make notes in each paragraph of what is 
discussed. To make this point clear, we shall quote again 
from Stone, p. 189, in which he gives an interesting illus- 
tration of what notes upon the selection How the Trolley 
Car Runs were made by a student in the class: 
4 1. Why the marble rolls and stops— two things that 
happen 
4 2. How to move cars —what electricity travels through 
— insulation — example, lightning rods—a circuit 
— free — closed 
q 3. The generator — power house — how it drives the cars 
— closed — broken circuit

4, Care in laying rails to prevent jumping of electricity 
5. The motorman’s work — speed — brakes — skidding 
wheels — sand 
6. How the car is heated — why it does not catch fire 
7. What the trolley is — how made and used 
8. How wires may be placed — underground — over- 
head — conduits 
9-11. Electric locomotives — third rail —loose wires 
— advantages of steam over electricity — storage

out rails — why the overhead trolley is preferred 
12-18. What the trolley does for the country — example, 
peach farm — speed in reaching markets — less expense 
— how it helps the steam road 
414. How the trolley helps the workman — in congested 
districts — Great Britain, Belgium, and Cleveland — 
Ancient ideas of the city and the trolley 
Fifth, still another interesting method is to have the children 
match paragraphs and paragraph headings. This may be 
carried on as group work as follows. The class is divided 
into two groups. Each group is given a short selection and 
each member of the group reads a selection and makes as 
many paragraph headings as possible in a given time. 
Each group then decides upon which is the best heading 
for each paragraph. These headings are handed over, with 
the book, to the other group for each member of the group 
to match all the headings that he can in a limited amount 
of time. Then the members of the groups agree upon the 
best matchings. The group that made the headings checks 
the matchings of the other group, and comparison is then 
made of the percentage of correct matchings made by each 
team. 
These are a few of the devices that have been worked out 
in the classroom for developing ability to recognize. Others 
may be found in the references at the end of the chapter, 
particularly in Germane and Stone. 
Retention. It is quite important that if the children are 
to get the most out of what they read, they should be able q q 
i 4 q 
q 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
156 | READING 
to retain a reasonable amount of information. One of the 
most serious criticisms brought against schools at the 
present time is the lack of definite information possessed 
by the pupil. Unless children learn facts thoroughly all 
that they learn is a jumble of hazy information or positive 
misinformation. This is regrettable and is due partly to 
the fact that memory is not infallible, but chiefly to the 
fact that school teachers do not place as much importance 
upon memory and drill as they should. We are inclined as 
a body to feel that if the children understand what they 
read we have completed our task of teaching. The criti- 
cism to which I have just referred can be removed only by 
greater attention to memorization and more intelligent use 
of the laws of memory and habit. The methods by which 
retention may be developed in the silent reading class are 
the following, based upon the Germanes’ work: (1) Get the 
interest of the pupils in the value of knowing things well. 
(2) Let the pupils know that they are to be tested on the 
material read, and do not fail to test them. (3) Give the 
oral or written test immediately after the material has been 
read. (4) Have short, brisk daily reviews of the out- 
standing facts of the previous day’s discussion or lesson. 
(5) Provide weekly and monthly reviews of the work cov- 
ered. (6) Have the pupils prepare lists of questions, the 
answers to which cover the main points in the work of the 
week or the month. (7) Let the test consist chiefly of 
these questions. Have the papers graded in class by the 
pupils and the teacher, who are also to decide upon what 
constitutes a complete answer. (8) See that the papers are 
at once returned to the pupils so as to give each a chance to 
review his own and to protest if he thinks it has been im- 
properly graded. 
Summary. In silent reading the interests of the children should 
be enlisted in speed, comprehension, organization and retention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  ORAL READING 157 
The teacher should carefully diagnose the difficulties of the in- 
dividual pupils and provide exercises which will remove their 
difficulties. Individual records should be kept and tests should 
be given from time to time so that the children can observe for 
themselves their own rate of improvement. 
3. Oral Reading 
Function. In oral reading the object of the reader is to 
convey to an audience the ideas and feelings which the 
author has expressed in the material to be read. It is based 
upon silent reading, since the reader cannot present the 
author’s ideas to the audience if he does not understand 
them and feel them himself. But it goes beyond silent 
reading in that it is concerned with the audience and with 
methods of oral expression. 
The Audience. In reading to an audience, the natural 
situation is this. The reader reads something in which he 
thinks the audience will be interested, and about which they 
do not know. For instance, we will not read the sport 
items in a newspaper to the person who is not interested in 
sport, nor will we read a joke to the serious-minded person 
who is incapable of seeing the point. Neither do we read 
to a person something that he has recently read himself. 
Usually before we read anything to any person outside of 
school we say, ““Have you read so-and-so?” and if they 
say, “Yes,” then it is quite foolish for us to read it to them. 
If, however, they say that they have not read it and if we 
think that they will be interested in it, we are properly pre- 
pared to begin the reading. 
This situation is complicated in school. Most reading 
lessons are carried on after all the pupils have read the 
lesson in the book in preparation for the recitation. In 
consequence of this we have an unnatural situation. The 
reader has neither of the two incentives to good reading that 
have just been mentioned, because the children are already
-P-A-G-E-174
  158 READING 
thoroughly acquainted with the material and there is no 
real objective in reading to them. 
However, this cannot be completely obviated in school 
because we are concerned not only with the content of what 
is read but with the forms of expression that the children 
use and the difficulties that they have in reading intelli- 
gently. Moreover, these forms of expression are so im- 
portant that they have to be drilled upon and the most 
efficient way of doing it is by having everybody read the 
same selection. 
Notwithstanding this fact, we can do much to develop 
real reading incentives. This can be done by having many 
supplementary readers and having a child or a group of 
children read one set which the other group has not read; 
then when the children of one group read they read to the 
children of the other group as an audience, and vice versa. 
Or individual children may bring in material which they 
have read and which they think will be of interest to their 
classmates, and read it to them. This material may be got 
from newspapers, magazines, and from books in the 
library. 
As a matter of fact, the teacher who wants to build up 
natural reading situations can easily invent many devices. 
The chief danger lies in the teacher’s not knowing about 
the natural reading situation and feeling that he has done 
his duty when he has had the children practice upon ma- 
terial which everybody already knows and is frequently 
quite indifferent to. 
Diagnosis. Here, as elsewhere, the scientific teacher an- 
alyzes the difficulties of the children in oral reading. He 
listens to each child, and sees what the trouble with him 
is. Sometimes the child is not conscious of any audi- 
ence and so reads too loudly or inaudibly. He may “call” 
words, he may mumble, or he may read either too 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
ORAL READING 159 
rapidly or too slowly. Moreover, he may express feeling 
poorly. 
Methods of Improvement. Several methods are mentioned 
for improving the children’s ability to read aloud. (1) 
First of all, it is necessary to get children interested in the 
audience idea and have them develop a real desire to read 
to other people. (2) As has just been stated, the class may 
be used as an audience. The reader should be expected to 
put his thought across to the audience and, on the part of 
the audience, help can be given by having them listen 
politely and requiring them to be able to give the most 
interesting point in what is read, name the characters, and 
tell at the end of the recitation which of the selections they 
like the best. The audience idea can be worked upon, 
therefore, from both ends — the reader trying to put his 
idea across to the audience and the audience trying to get 
his idea. Those of us who have read or spoken to an 
audience know how much of our enthusiasm in speaking 
or reading is determined by the interest of the audience. 
If everybody watches us as we speak we are enthusiastic. 
If they are looking out of the windows we grow discouraged. 
Children are not different from adults in this respect. (3) 
A very good method of developing oral reading is through 
dramatization. When the children take part in home-made 
plays it is surprising how natural their expression becomes. 
They cease reading and begin to talk. This is especially 
true if they do not have to memorize their words too 
exactly. (4) Another method of getting the audience idea 
across is to have children go to the public library or to the 
books in the school library to look up selections upon some 
topic. For instance, if in history the Colonial period is 
being discussed and there are four histories by different 
authors in the library, it is possible to have the children 
study the different authors and be prepared to read what 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
    160 READING 
they have to say in class upon the different points raised. 
Frequently authors differ in their statements and the 
children are very much interested in bringing in these con- 
flicting statements and reading them to the class. (5) Oc- 
casionally the procedure can be varied by having the teacher 
take a story out of a magazine and cut it up into a half- 
dozen sections. These can be pasted on separate small 
sheets of cardboard and handed to a half-dozen pupils, each 
of whom will read his own section. Finally (6) much can 
be accomplished by having the teacher himself read to the 
pupils. Example is of considerable value in teaching proper 
standards. The teacher with a fairly good voice who has 
the audience idea himself and can read naturally, ought to 
use his own oral reading as a method of developing skill in 
his pupils. 
Summary. In developing the audience idea and getting the 
children to read naturally to the audience, it is important that 
the children be interested in the problem and work upon it, that 
they use the class as an audience, and that they dramatize the 
material. Variations can be made by having topical readings 
and by using the cut-up story. The teacher should frequently 
read to the class, also. 
Reading Aloud. A few of the specific difficulties with 
which we are confronted in reading aloud may be men- 
tioned. Children frequently are unable to read aloud 
effectively because they are not conscious of the audience, 
and to cure this difficulty they should be talked to about 
what reading aloud really means. They should be made 
to realize that it is their problem to interest the audience, 
and their duty to read intelligently and pleasingly. Some- 
times their difficulty is due to shyness. They are not at 
their best when they stand on their feet and read to people. 
Frequently it is due to the fact that they have little ability 
to pronounce the words. They may halt. and stumble. 
In fact, they may have so much difficulty in recognizing
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  ORAL READING 161 
words and may have to give so much attention to word 
recognition that they forget the audience. 
Punctuation Marks. Frequently a pupil allows his voice 
to rise at a period or to drop at a question mark, and pays 
no attention to commas. The mechanical method of 
handling this is for the teacher to say, “John, you did not 
let your voice fall at that period. Read it again and see 
that it falls”; but this method is ineffective because John, 
if he is like many other children or adults, does not know 
how to make his voice rise or fall and when he tries, does 
not know whether it goes up or down. ‘The trouble with 
John’s reading is that he does not understand the sentences. 
Tf he did his voice would drop naturally without any 
attention on his part. Therefore, instead of telling John 
to obey this artificial rule, the teacher should help him to 
understand what he is reading. 
Loud Reading. Frequently as soon as a pupil begins to 
read he starts to shout. Instead of merely saying, “Do not 
read so loudly,” the teacher should go to the bottom of the 
matter. He reads loudly because he has forgotten his 
audience. Say to him, “Do not try to make the blacksmith 
in the village hear — read to me, here beside you.” Then, 
as he realizes that his audience is near his voice will fall. 
Too Low Reading. Exactly similar is the trouble with 
those pupils who read in a voice too low to be heard dis- 
tinctly. They have forgotten their audience. The rule 
for all speakers and readers to follow is to address the 
people who are farthest from them in the room. When a 
speaker does this his voice naturally begins to accommodate 
itself to the distance. Therefore if the pupil reads in tones 
too low to be pleasing and audible, the teacher may place 
himself in the distant corner of the room and have the pupil 
read to him, or may tell the pupil to read to the boy or girl 
farthest away from him.
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 READING 
Calling Words. The practice of stopping before each 
word is due in part to the practice sometimes permitted in 
primary reading where the teacher does not require the 
children to read fluently. It is partly due to the inability 
of the reader to recognize the words rapidly and in part to 
his failure to understand what he is reading. As far as 
I know the best plan to follow is to give such a reader, or 
the whole class or school, if they “call” words, drills upon 
speed in reading. They should read from books that are 
easy to understand and that contain simple words, and 
should be stimulated to read as rapidly as possible. These 
selections should be read over and over again at a high 
rate of speed, until the pupils have learned how to read 
something without calling words. The skill so obtained can 
then be carried over to the ordinary oral reading material. 
Mumbling. This defect can be helped very materially if, 
again, the reader realizes that he has an audience. When 
he selects something for the pupils to hear, something that 
he likes, something that they will like and that they do not 
know, and when he finds, by the teacher’s bringing it out 
from the class, that they do not understand, he will begin 
to think about his articulation and enunciation. People 
mumble when, from embarrassment or other causes, they 
are not trying to get other people to understand them. 
They merely talk. But when the desire to convince is 
born, the effort to cure the mumbling increases and the 
results are close to realization. 
Better Expression. One common criticism made by 
teachers after the pupil has read, and when it is his busi- 
ness to say something, is, “Yes, but see if you can put more 
expression into it,” or, “Try again and see if you can do 
better.” Two more silly criticisms cannot be found, for 
the boy cannot put more feeling into it than he feels inside 
and a command will not make him feel more. When he is 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  PRIMARY READING 168 
told to read better he has no idea how to do it. Both 
criticisms are too vague. It is better by far for the teacher, 
if he wants better expression, to go over the selection again 
with the class so that they will feel its spirit more; then, 
and only then, will the class put more expression into the 
reading of the selection. 
Personally, I am of the opinion that for grade reading 
the standard ought to be set at plain, rather than at dra- 
matic, reading. If the boy seems to understand what he 
reads and reads it intelligently, enough has been accom- 
plished. This means that in many selections with strong 
emotions, little attention would need to be paid to the 
emotional element. As a matter of fact, many selections 
studied by children express emotions so deep and complex 
that even the average adult could not feel them. 
Take such a selection as — “Is life so dear, or peace so 
sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? 
Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others 
may take but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death!” 
This feeling is so exalted and so clearly an adult emotion 
that grade children can appreciate it only superficially. 
To try to get them to read it as Edwin Booth or Richard 
Mansfield read it would make them highly artificial. We 
should be satisfied if we see that they understand a selec- 
tion and read it naturally. Any additional emotion that 
the individual reader might express I should gladly wel- 
come, but I should have him make no serious effort to 
express emotion which is not present. Let the pupil get 
into the spirit of a passage as fully as he can, with the aid 
of the teacher, and then let the emotional expression take 
care of itself. 
4. Primary Reading 
Function. The peculiar function of primary reading which 
distinguishes it from reading in general, is that it handles
-P-A-G-E-180
    164 READING 
the learning of words and word-forms. When the child 
has completed the primary grades, whatever else he has 
learned, he must have mastered the art of knowing words at 
sight and connecting them with what they stand for. When 
he enters the primary grades he has no knowledge of word 
symbols. When he leaves them he has quite considerable 
facility in the recognition of words, in eye movements, and 
in the mechanics of oral reading. 
During these grades the rate of oral and silent reading 
increases rapidly up to the intermediate grades, where the 
child begins to*approximate his maximum rate. Certain 
factors influence primary reading. Attendance is quite 
important, at least to the extent that if the student is 
absent more than two months out of the nine-month period 
in the first grade, itis extremely doubtful that he can keep 
up with his grade. The children of parents who speak 
foreign languages in the home are quite severely handi- 
capped in learning to read the English language. Students 
with low intelligence quotients may not succeed. “Intel- 
ligence quotient” is a term used to measure mental ability. 
Children’s ages are measured in two ways — mental and 
chronological. That is to say, a man thirty years of age 
may have the mind of a six-year-old boy and a child ten 
years of age measured by the calendar may be quite old 
for his years and be as bright as children usually are at the 
age of fifteen. We have methods of determining the 
mental age of children, such as the Binet-Simon tests. The 
intelligence quotient is obtained by dividing the mental age 
by the chronological age. The thirty-year-old man with the 
six-year-old mind would have an intelligence quotient of 
6/30 or .20, while the ten-year-old child with the mind of 
fifteen would have an intelligence quotient of 15/10 or 1.5. 
The normal child would have an intelligence quotient of 
“1.” Children of low intelligence quotients do not learn
-P-A-G-E-181
PRIMARY READING 165 
to read so rapidly as do those of average intelligence, or 
higher. 
Subject-Matter. Authors of primary readers have a wide 
field from which to select the material through which they 
will teach word recognition and the technique of reading. 
They usually observe three principles of selection. Clearly 
the material should be interesting to children since interest 
increases effort. Generally speaking, it is better to select 
easy rather than difficult material upon which to work and 
on the whole material which results in action is likely to 
prove to be stimulating. In brief, the content of primary 
reading should be interesting, easy, and full of action. 
Some illustrations of material of this sort may be sum- 
marized. Most of the early school readers chose common 
objects with monosyllabic names that were easy to spell, 
such as oz, cat, fan, dog, man. More recently, however, we 
find use being made of Mother Goose and other nursery 
rhymes which the children already know by heart and 
love. Being known and loved they are enjoyed when read 
in books. The plays and games of children are frequently 
used as a basis for the reading lesson. The common expe- 
riences in the environment of children, such as the circus, 
the family, games, etc., are used to good advantage. Sim- 
ilarly, plays and games have a place in primary read- 
ing. Particularly actions expressed in sentences as, “Find 
the ball,” “Hide the picture,” etc., have an important 
place. 
In some readers the subject-matter is quite inane and 
silly as viewed by the normal six-year-old child. This, 
however, is growing to be less and less true as we grow away 
from the idea that little simple words which are easy to 
spell are the easiest to learn. The size of the word has only 
a little to do with the ease of recognizing it compared with 
the interest of the word. That is to say, an interesting
-P-A-G-E-182
    166 READING 
word that is long is easier to remember than an uninteresting 
word which is short, just as a very large man who is inter- 
esting to the little child is more easily recognized than the 
quite uninteresting little baby. 
Summary. The materials of primary reading may be selected 
from a variety of sources under the principles of interest, ease, 
and action. 
Difficulties. There are several types of difficulties which 
are met in teaching primary reading. Six of these may 
be mentioned. 
(1) Children may be poor in word recognition. The 
recognition of words has some rather interesting char- 
acteristics. Recognizing words corresponds closely to the 
recognition of people. A child may know words without 
knowing the letters in them. A page of words is like a 
crowd of people. If you will forget the fact that you know 
letters and look at the words on this page you will see that 
they look different from one another. Some are long and 
some are short, some run above the line and some below. 
The word “the” which occurs frequently on the page has 
certain peculiarities which, when recognized, will enable a 
person who knows anything about letters at all to pick it 
out wherever he sees it. So with the words a and is. In 
some cases it is easier to recognize long words than short 
ones because there are more peculiarities in the word. 
Later on the child is able to recognize the difference between 
words like house and horse, which in general appearance are 
very much alike. : 
This procedure is quite closely parallel to that of recog- 
nizing people. There are large people and small people, 
blond and dark people, blue-eyed and brown-eyed people, 
boys and girls, men and women, and so on. The child is 
able to distinguish between these people and call them by 
name without being able to state what is the color of their
-P-A-G-E-183
  PRIMARY READING 167 
eyes or their size or the shape of their noses. Even though 
he does not know these details he can, from a group of 
people, pick out those whom he knows. Similarly, when 
the child is confronted with a page of reading matter he 
is able to pick out words simply because they look different 
and not because he knows just what the differences are. 
It is obvious, therefore, that children will have difficulty in 
word recognition when they are not quick at distinguishing 
between words and remembering the appearance of those 
that they have met. 
(2) Children may not have independence in working out 
new words for themselves. When a bright child has met 
one hundred words he is beginning to distinguish and can 
make a very good guess at what another word may be, but 
if he is not particularly bright he may be quite helpless in 
his guessing. In this case he has to be taught each word 
by itself and this becomes a very laborious task for the 
teacher. Methods of curing this will be taken up later 
when we discuss phonics. 
(3) A child may be very slow in his recognition and pro- 
nunciation of words. In that case he does not know them 
well enough to pronounce them rapidly. Drill upon speed 
and thoroughness of recognition are the methods used in 
handling this difficulty. 
(4) He may have poor expression due to the fact that he 
“calls” words rather than reads naturally. In reading 
“T went to the fair,” he may pause before each of the words 
when as a matter of fact he should make the statement, 
“T went to the fair” as a single unitary idea. This is partly 
taken care of by what is spoken of as the “‘look-say” 
method. A child who calls words in the first grade will, 
when this method is used, be asked to look at what is said, 
then turn from the book or the board and repeat it as if 
it were a sentence. This difficulty can be easily cured by
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 READING 
the teacher if he remembers that the sentence rather than 
the word is the unit of thought. 
(5) Children may mispronounce words. This is handled 
easily by having immediate drill upon the correct pro- 
nunciation. When the word is first taught it should be 
pronounced correctly and time should be taken to see that 
the pronunciation of each individual child is correct. 
(6) In primary reading children frequently repeat the 
words. This is due to lack of skill in recognition and can 
. be cured by attention to speed. 
The Sentence Method. Historically, three methods have 
been used in teaching primary reading. The oldest method 
was the alphabetic method. The children were taught 
their letters. The theory was that since the letters are 
the element of the word they should be taught first. How- 
ever, a fallacy was discovered in this theory. Children are 
not interested in letters as such. The letter a or m means 
nothing to them. They are not keys to action or to in- 
teresting ideas, so because of lack of interest it was found 
that the children did not learn their letters with great 
facility. 
Because of this difficulty, the word method was intro- 
duced. It was discovered that children could recognize 
the difference between “dog” and “‘cat” just as easily as 
they could learn to distinguish between “d” and “ec.” It 
was observed further, as has just been said, that people in 
recognizing words do not need to know the letters of which 
they are made, so children were taught such words as 
“candy,” “knives,” “ropes,” “balls,” “dogs,” etc., and 
were found to learn them more rapidly because the objects 
for which the words stood were much more interesting than 
the letters which occupied their attention when the alpha- 
betic method was used. 
As time went on, experienced teachers learned that chil-
-P-A-G-E-185
  PRIMARY READING 169 
dren could learn sentences just as quickly as they could 
learn words. The sentence has this very great advantage 
—it can lead the children to perform actions. When 
“Roll the ball” is placed on the board they become very 
much interested because they are able to go through the 
action of rolling the ball as a reward for reading the sen- 
tence. So, at the present time, primary teachers universally 
use a combination of the sentence and the word method. 
Some words are taught and these are thrown into sentences 
as soon as possible. Interestingly enough, the children in 
this case may learn to recognize as many as twelve hundred 
words without knowing the letters of the alphabet. How- 
ever, this does not mean that the alphabet should not be 
taught. It is necessary sometime during the first year to 
have the children recognize all the letters of the alphabet 
and it is wise for the teacher to have the children memorize 
the letters in the order in which they conventionally appear 
in the alphabet. They should be memorized glibly because 
in using the dictionary and in many other situations they 
need to know the letters in the order in which they occur. 
Some teachers find it wise to have children in the second 
and third grades and even in the first, memorize the al- 
phabet backward as well as forward — thus: zyz, wv, uts, 
rqp, onm, lkj, thg, fed, cba. 
In using these methods it is customary to begin with 
action words. A few names of common actions should be 
selected by the teacher, such as find, hunt, roll, walk, run, 
skip, etc. Then objects may be connected with these as 
“Find the ball,” “‘Find the cap,” “Find the crayon,” and 
so on. These words are written on the board and the 
children perform the indicated actions. To get speed in 
word recognition the words so taught may be placed on 
flash cards which are flashed before the children while they 
pronounce the word as quickly as they see it. Simple sen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 READING 
tences may be placed upon flash cards, also. All the 
teacher needs to do is to secure some pieces of paper about 
6 x 9 inches in size and write upon them whatever he wishes 
to drill upon. 
Children seem to turn rapidly from the script which is 
put on the blackboard to the words which are printed in 
the book so that the transition between the board work and 
the textbook work is easy. 
Phonics. As long as children are being taught individual 
words by the teacher word recognition is a fairly simple 
matter, but there soon comes a time when the teacher can- 
not teach every word and when the children, if properly 
instructed, can develop independence in “guessing” at 
words for themselves. Many bright children can soon 
learn to guess at new words from the context and eventually 
become good readers without any training on the part of 
the teacher beyond the initial teaching of words and 
sentences. For the average child, however, assistance in 
breaking words up into their elementary sounds is neces- 
sary. This is done by means of phonics. The phone is a 
letter sound rather than a letter name. If we break a 
word up into the letters of the alphabet, thus — c-a-t — 
and pronounce each of the letters slowly, we secure a com- 
pound which sounds like this —see-a-tee. This, when 
pronounced rapidly, gives us a word like “‘seeatee” which 
does not sound in the least like “cat.” When we use the 
letter sounds rather than the letter name, however, we say 
that the sound for “c” is “kuh,” for “a” is “ah,” and 
“t” is “tuh.” “Cat” then becomes “kuh-ah-tuh.” 
When this is pronounced rapidly, we at once get “cat.” 
Obviously, therefore, by learning the sounds, independence 
in recognizing words can be developed in the child. 
This is known as the phonic method. After the children 
have been taught from the board and books by the word
-P-A-G-E-187
THE STUDY OF LITERATURE 171 
  and sentence method for a few weeks, it is customary to 
begin to introduce phonics as an independent drill practiced 
for ten to fifteen minutes at a time. The words which the 
children have already learned are broken up and new words 
that they have not yet become acquainted with are given 
them to give them the opportunity of guessing at the 
correct sound. 
Primary supervisors report that there is a great danger of 
spending too much time upon phonics. They state that 
many teachers who feel that they must teach phonics every 
day have classes in which the exercises are quite deadly 
dull. Supervisors are convinced of the fact that phonics 
needs to be taught, not as a subject worth while for itself, 
but merely as an aid in recognizing words, and that no more 
attention needs to be paid to it than is necessary to have 
the children read the material in the regular reading lesson 
with skill. In phonics, as elsewhere, it is necessary to 
remember that what the children learn in school is of 
importance not so much for its own sake as for its use in 
helping them become acquainted with the fundamental 
facts of life and the tools which civilization has developed. 
Summary. In primary reading the important task is to teach 
the child how to recognize words. This is done by bringing him 
in touch with interesting and easy material, and by study of the 
difficulties which he faces. A combination of the sentence and 
word method is most satisfactory. This should be supplemented 
by an intelligent use of phonics. 
5. The Study of Literature 
In the grades, reading and literature have usually been 
considered together because reading textbooks usually con- 
sist of literary selections. Not all the history and geog- 
raphy studied from day to day is read in class, but nearly 
all literature is. 
In the reading process, literature is connected with both
-P-A-G-E-188
  172 READING 
silent and oral reading because when it is read the pupil 
has to understand it and feel its spirit. This, it seems to 
me, is the general problem of literature in the grades — how 
to understand the ideas and feel the spirit of a selection 
from literature. 
Literature differs from printed material which is not 
literature in two respects. The chief difference is the es- 
thetic element. A piece of reading may or may not be 
called literature. It is not worthy of the name of literature 
if the form of expression is not artistic or if the content is 
not beautiful. Ugly things may be described in an artistic 
manner, but ordinarily literature deals with beautiful 
rather than ugly material. Usually, also, the person who 
writes literature rather than mere reading material, ex- 
presses some feeling about the thing that he writes. A 
scientific treatise dealing with abstract subjects which the 
author writes upon in a purely impersonal way as a state- 
ment of fact, is not strictly literature. Some sort of 
personal feeling has to be expressed. This is very well 
expressed by the oft-repeated statement of the mathe- 
matician who, when he read 
“Half a league, half a league, half a league onward, 
Into the valley of death rode the six hundred,” 
remarked, “Why didn’t the fool say, ‘A league and a 
half’”? He missed entirely the feeling of the author that 
prompted him to express the tragedy of the situation 
which faced the “six hundred” in having to rush uselessly 
“into the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell.” 
Summary. Written material becomes literature when it ex- 
presses emotional ideas in beautiful form. 
Problem. One very striking fact about literature is that 
every unit, be it a stanza or a book, is solving some problem 
and answering some question that experience has put to
-P-A-G-E-189
    
THE STUDY OF LITERATURE 173 
the author. For instance, in Longfellow’s Psalm of Life 
the author is answering the question, “Is life an empty 
dream?” and he gives his arguments for and against it. 
So every poem answers or tries to answer its own question. 
This is one function, perhaps the function, of literature — 
to solve certain problems and answer certain questions. 
Although the literary selection contains an answer to a 
question, the reader may read the selection without bother- 
ing to get a definite idea of the answer but if he is properly 
guided he will try to get a clear conception of both question 
or problem and answer or solution. For instance, in the 
Psalm of Life the reader may read the poem and enjoy it, 
and when he is through say to himself, “Yes, I guess he is 
right — life is more than an empty dream,” without being 
able to give the reason for thinking so. But another more 
inquisitive reader may, in his reading, search for the 
answer. In doing so he, in effect, outlines the poem, and 
he finds that Longfellow’s answer to the question is that 
life is not an empty dream for two reasons. First, we live 
to help others, and second we must make haste to help 
them. He finds that the poem is divided into about four 
divisions — stanzas 1-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9. Each of these 
makes the answer clearer. Thefirst group states his answer 
boldly. The second shows the necessity for haste; the third 
shows howwe can help others; the fourth urges us to action. 
While the ideas are being discovered we feel the beauty 
and the emotion expressed. We do not study feeling con- 
sciously to any great extent in the grades. Feeling comes 
like the odor of the bread that we buy. When we buy 
bread we do not purchase the odor. We want something 
to eat in order to live; the odor is thrown in as an im- 
portant by-product. So, in literature we get the idea, 
and the feeling clings to it like an aroma. The one way of 
developing feeling is to have the children fully understand
-P-A-G-E-190
  174 READING 
the author and gather as much of the feeling as they can. 
If the pupil is highly emotional and sympathetic he will 
get a great deal of feeling out of it. If he is not highly 
emotional he will get much less. Moreover, if the teacher 
feels the emotion deeply the children will catch it from 
him, but if he has no feeling about it he cannot transmit 
any through himself to the children. In that case, they will 
have to get it directly from the author, if they get it at all. 
Beauty. As we have just said, literature is different from 
mere reading in that it obeys the laws of beavty. I may 
say, “When I stand on the seashore and see the waves 
breaking, I sometimes wish that I could express the thoughts 
that come to me.” This is a statement of mere fact, but 
when Tennyson says, 
Break, break, break, 
On thy cold grey stones, O Sea, 
And I would that my tongue could utter 
The thoughts that arise in me, 
he gives us literature, he adds beauty and feeling to the 
bald fact. 
The feeling of beauty is not something that can be 
commanded, it grows and develops. But the teacher can 
cultivate an appreciation for the beautiful by paying 
attention to at least two devices. In the first place, he 
can spend a good deal of time building up the mental 
pictures. For instance, in the words, “Break, break, 
break, On thy cold grey stones, O Sea,” a picture is sug- 
gested. The teacher can by illustration and conversation 
get the pupils to imagine themselves standing on the shore 
watching the waves breaking on the stones, get the sig- 
nificance of the word “grey,” make the picture clearer and 
show the significance of the word “cold.” To get the 
feeling he can talk about the different moods, he can explain 
how the mood that we are in makes things appear different.
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE STUDY OF LITERATURE 175 
He may explain how a man in a happy mood might look at 
the same scene and not see cold grey stones but perhaps 
the cheerful sparkle of the waves as they broke against the 
stones. It pays to make haste slowly in order that images 
that are not beyond the children’s comprehension may be 
built up by deliberate and daily study. The teacher needs 
to use discretion in selecting the images and literary pictures 
upon which to spend time for analysis. 
In the second place, the children can be asked two 
questions with a wide range of variations — “What do you 
like best in the selection?” and “Why?” The important 
element in appreciation is to have the children become 
conscious of the things they like. This trains the pupils 
to be young but sympathetic critics, and out of this, appre- 
ciation grows. ‘The expert critic asks himself only these 
two questions and he seeks to answer them profoundly. 
The child is put into the appreciative attitude when he 
asks himself these same questions and answers them simply 
in his own words. 
The teacher may reinforce the pupil’s likes and dislikes or 
may modify them by his own opinions, in which the pupil 
has confidence, but the teacher should not talk too much 
about beauty and feeling. ‘They grow faster when they 
are not talked about too much and when the standards are 
not set too high. 
Subject-Matter. In selecting subject-matter for literature 
study the fundamental principle of interest is the one to 
follow. Care must be taken in the preparation of text- 
books that selections which are within the comprehension 
of children and which stimulate their interest may be 
brought to their attention. The failure to follow this 
principle with intelligence is largely responsible for chil- 
dren’s dislike of literature in school and their failure to read 
it after they leave school. Many teachers feel that the
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 READING 
children should be made acquainted with the classics 
irrespective of interest. The intelligent teacher seeks to 
select from the classical writings only those which will 
interest the children when they are taught them by an 
efficient and forceful teacher. 
Some studies have been made to discover which selections 
ordinarily read by children are of greatest interest, and the 
results of the study of Uhl are given in the references at the 
end of the chapter. 
Grading. In deciding upon what literature should be 
taught in each grade we have two general principles — the 
principles of interest and difficulty. The literature studied 
should be interesting to the pupils and should not be too 
difficult in its expression. Browning would hardly be 
taught in the primary grades, partly because his subjects 
are not interesting to children in these grades but chiefly 
because his form of expression makes him difficult to under- 
stand. The beginning teacher naturally has to rely largely 
upon the textbooks with which he is provided, but as he 
grows in experience he will learn to omit or lightly pass over 
those selections in the readers which are neither interesting 
nor easy to read. 
Appreciation. In the study of literature the chief ob- 
jective of the teacher is to develop a love of literature in the 
pupil. If he can make the pupils fond of reading literature 
his work is done because after they leave school their love 
for the subject will induce them to read an increasing 
amount of classical material. 
I have already mentioned two or three methods of de- 
veloping appreciation. The problem idea should be 
developed. Children should see that the author is trying 
to answer some question. ‘Time should also be taken to 
dwell upon images that will appeal to the children. Ques- 
tions should be asked the children concerning the things
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE STUDY OF LITERATURE 177 
that they like and do not like and their reasons for likes 
and dislikes. Discussions may also be held upon these 
topics. Children may be asked whether or not they agree 
with the solution that the author has developed and may 
be asked to give their reasons. When they differ about 
what they like and do not like they may argue the matter 
out among themselves. Particularly useful in developing 
an appreciation of good literature is the practice of reading 
by the teacher who himself loves good literature. Long 
before people could read they were brought into contact 
with good literature through songs sung by minstrels and 
professional singers and through traveling readers. The 
natural vehicle of literature is the voice. It is essentially 
a matter of oral reading rather than of silent reading. 
Such being the case, the teacher who can “lend to the 
rhyme of the poet the music of his voice” has control of a 
powerful instrument for developing appreciation. 
Memorization. It is wise to have pupils memorize care- 
fully selected topics. The selection should be made with 
care because only those poems that are of interest now, 
and will be of interest in the years to come, should be 
memorized. In memorizing the “whole” method should 
be used. To illustrate what is meant by the whole method 
may we indicate the usual method of memorizing poetry. 
Suppose the selection to be memorized is the Psalm of Life. 
This consists of thirty-six lines. The common method of 
memorizing is to learn the first line first and then go on 
down, thus: 
Tell me not in mournful numbers, 
Tell me not in mournful numbers, 
Tell me not in mournful numbers, 
Life is but an empty dream, 
Life is but an empty dream, 
Tell me not in mournful numbers, 
Life is but an empty dream,
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 READING 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
And things are not what they seem. 
And things are not what they seem. 
And things are not what they seem. 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
And things are not what they seem. 
Tell me not in mournful numbers, 
Life is but an empty dream, 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
And things are not what they seem. 
In criticizing this method one important fact is to be 
borne in mind. Since memory is aided by the association 
of words, the best association would be to connect the last 
word of each line with the first word of the next line, thus 
— “numbers” should be connected with “Life,” “dream” 
with “For,” “slumbers” with “And,” and so on, but that 
is not the connection set up in this illustration. By looking 
at the foregoing repetitions you will find that the connec- 
tions of “numbers” are “numbers Tell” “numbers Tell,” 
“numbers Life” and the connections of “slumbers” are 
“slumbers For” “‘slumbers For” “slumbers And.” Psy- 
chology makes the point that the connection “numbers 
Tell” and “slumbers For” are harmful to memorization by 
setting up wrong associations, so they have suggested the 
“whole” method which safeguards the correct associa- 
tions and actually enables one to memorize more rapidly in 
the end. By the “whole” method children will read the 
thirty-six lines of the Psalm of Life over once, then they will 
read them all over again and again and again until the 
whole is memorized. If it is discovered that some parts 
cause particular difficulty special repetition of them may 
be given, but the material should be read from start to 
finish over and over again until all is learned. 
One would think, off-hand, that this method requires a  
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE STUDY OF LITERATURE 179 
greater length of time, but it actually takes less. Little 
children may fee] that they are not getting anywhere and 
may prefer the customary “part” method, yet if the 
teacher knows how to use the “whole”? method himself he 
can induce the children to use it as rapidly as they can be 
weaned from the “part” method. They will soon become 
used to the temporary discouragement that is due to the 
frequent readings which are necessary before any part 
sticks completely. 
Dramatization. Simple dramatization is an excellent 
means of teaching literature. It makes the ideas more 
clear, furnishes a good reason for reading carefully, and it 
impresses the dramatized ideas upon the memory. Children 
love to dramatize and any teacher can give instruction in 
it. The children can easily make up their own lines and 
it is better to have a simple setting and properties than 
elaborate equipment. Children in everyday dramatization 
need not, and ought not, memorize the material closely. 
They should talk it, give the sense rather than the exact 
words, though it will be found that if left to themselves 
they naturally use many of the words of the story. For 
detailed directions about how to guide children in dram- 
atization the reader is referred to the references at the end 
of the chapter. 
Summary. The teacher of literature has for his most important 
objective the development of appreciation and love for literature. 
Every selection of literature should be looked upon as solving an 
interesting problem and beauty and feeling should be developed 
as a by-product. Material should be graded according to in- 
terest and difficulty; in memorizing the whole method should 
usually be utilized, and dramatization and the oral reading of the 
teacher are of first importance in developing appreciation.

  CHAPTER VI 
DRAWING 
1. Subject-Matter 
Tux term “drawing” is used in the schools to include more 
than it strictly means. It embraces both the developing 
of the ability to portray ideas, and an appreciation of 
works of pictorial art. In some courses of study it includes 
other branches of the fine arts, such as modeling and the 
appreciation of sculpture, architecture, etc. 
The Function of Art Study. The parallel between draw- 
ing and language is very close. In drawing, as in language, 
the object is to communicate some value to other people 
who, it is expected, will be interested to some degree. 
When a stranger asks for directions we may either tell him 
in words how to proceed or we may draw a diagram. The 
designer may either describe what a costume will look like 
or he may draw a sketch. The poet and the artist, sitting 
by the river, may express the same feelings through different 
media. The poet writes a poem and the artist paints a 
picture. Speaker or artist, each has a choice of means of 
communication. In either case he communicates some- 
thing that he thinks is worth while. The essential differ- 
ence between language and drawing is merely one of the 
medium through which communication is carried on. The 
speaker uses words and the artist uses color, tone, and line. 
The words are combined into essays and novels, poems 
and plays. The colors, tones, and lines are combined into 
landscapes, portraits, and so on.  
-P-A-G-E-199
  SUBJECT-MATTER 183 
There is a further parallel between these two modes of 
expression. Both writer and artist follow rules of com- 
position. The artist makes an outline; so does the writer. 
The writer introduces detail according to rules and stand- 
ards, as does the artist. When language is on the level 
where it becomes literature, and drawing is of such quality 
as to be called art, the translation of each into experience 
is likewise parallel. The reader of literature attempts to 
relive the writer’s experience. The observer of the work 
of art tries in like manner to decipher the symbols which 
the artist has used to express his idea so that he may relive 
his experience with him. And just as each poem solves a 
problem and satisfies a need, so in like manner does a 
picture express some central idea which constitutes its 
meaning. The difference is merely one of medium. The 
process of reading a poem is essentially the same as that 
of “reading” a picture. 
Because of this close relation between language and 
literature on the one hand and drawing and _ pictorial 
art on the other, the principles that have been applied in 
the last few chapters will, in the main, apply to the teach- 
ing of drawing. What differences occur are largely 
due to the fact that we substitute color and form for 
words, 
The function of drawing then, is to communicate values 
through form and color to an interested audience. Like 
language, it is a vehicle of expression. As “literature,” it is 
a means of gaining experience through appreciation. For 
the one who draws, drawing is a means of expressing an 
idea, while for the one who views the drawing it is a means 
of gaining an idea from the artist. 
The parallel between drawing and speech is very well 
illustrated by Lukens in the following table.  
-P-A-G-E-200
184 DRAWING 
The development of drawing should show the same stages as the development of speech, suggested as follows: 
Sprecu 
1. Automatic cries and reflex 
or impulsive sounds. 
2. Imitation of sound, but 
without meaning; child 
babbles when addressed. 
8. Understands words, but does 
not speak beyond such 
words as “mama,” 
“papa,” etc. 
4. Repeats words as mere 
sounds when they are 
said to him. 
5. Uses words to express his 
thoughts. 
6. Studies grammar and 
rhetoric. 
x9 oe o or) Drawine 
. Automatic and aimless 
scribble. 
. Scribbling localizations and 
imitations of movements 
of other persons’ hands. 
8. Understands pictures, but 
does not draw beyond the 
simplest localization of 
features by scribbling. 
. Copies from others to see 
how to get effects in the 
use of lines. 
. Picture writing, illustrated 
stories, scenes, etc. 
. Studies the technique of 
drawing, perspective, pro- 
portion, shading, etc. 
Drawing is a more vivid vehicle of expression than lan- 
guage in two ways. In the first place it is more graphic; 
that is, it shows the meaning more quickly and clearly. 
The newspaper cartoon is an excellent example of this. 
For instance, in February, 1913, the world was shocked 
and impressed by the splendid heroism of Captain Scott 
and his companions at the South Pole. Many columns of 
newspaper copy were written about their actions, and the 
diary of the dead leader was published and widely read. 
But a single cartoon by McCutcheon in the Chicago Tribune 
expressed more at a glance than pages of written material. 
The artist showed a low, level, ice-covered plain, a dark 
sky, an ice-covered shaft from whose top floated the Danish 
flag, and at whose base drooped an English ensign, while 
recumbent in a position of utter weariness the bodies of 
four men made the nuclei of the little hummocks of snow 
which covered them. A reader can get nearer to the heart

of the news in less time by following the cartoons of a 
good newspaper than by reading the editorial columns. 
What holds true for cartoons is true for all art — it con- 
denses volumes into a few lines and tones. 
In the second place, drawing is a better vehicle than 
language because it is more universal. “One hundred 
people read pictures for every one who reads a book.” 
G. Stanley Hall says: 
The American child needs more, not less, pictures. How, 
e.g., Homer, not to say Virgil, the Greek dramatists, Shake- 
speare, and the great masterpieces, would be vivified by an 
abundance of even cheap reproductions of the best pictures with 
which artists have illustrated classic story! History, too, has 
been visualized, not only by portraits, but by scenes of battle, 
congresses, and other pictorial events which have idealized and 
could give great enhancement of zest to its dogged pages. Science, 
too, cannot have too many illustrations. Our geographies, es- 
pecially illustrated as they are now, need a great profusion of addi- 
tional views of mountains, valleys, shores, seas, landscapes, towns, 
streets, and everything else which can be made so vivid as almost 
to take the place of travel. The stereoscope is now so developed 
that groups of scenes and hundreds of binocular pictures of, e.g., 
Palestine, Egypt, India, the Rocky Mountains, etc., give the 
spectator an almost complete sense of being present and of actually 
gazing upon landscapes, cities, or ruins from various points of 
view which are often indicated on the map, one after another, so 
that one knows the point of the compass toward which he is 
looking, etc., until the illusion of actually seeing everything is 
almost complete, and after a careful course of such pictures he 
almost seems to himself to have visited the locality. The illu- 
sion of depth, perspective, and the isolation of indirect vision are 
the essential factors of this seeming transposition. If some time 
in the future these proxy trips should be supplemented by mov- 
ing pictures and phonographs, as they are sure to be, then the 
pupils of, e.g., the geography class will take ideal trips through 
foreign lands, see savages, jungles, industries, and all kinds of life 
without leaving the classroom. 
Summary. Drawing parallels both language and literature 
because it is both a vehicle of expression for the artist and a 
means to getting experience from the artist. In some situations 
jt is a better vehicle than language because it is easier to under- 
stand; and being easier, is more widely used. In drawing, the
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 DRAWING 
artist has an idea which he wishes to express to an audience that 
_ he believes will be interested, and as a student of pictures the 
observer attempts to relive the experience of the artist. 
Ideals. In the teaching of art, two ideals are of major 
importance. The first and most important of these is the 
appreciation of the beautiful in art. When the child has 
finished his course in drawing he should have developed a 
taste for the beauty that is found in color and line through 
some understanding of the principles of rhythm, balance, 
and harmony. In addition to this he should be possessed 
of an amateur ability to express ideas in black-and-white 
and colored drawings. He is not expected to be a finished 
artist, but he should have some simple facility to express 
his ideas without embarrassment and with pleasure. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. These two ideals constitute 
the teacher’s objectives. That is to say, it is the business 
of the teacher to develop in children a love for beautiful 
pictures and some understanding of why they are beautiful. 
It is also the duty of the teacher to develop in his pupils 
some skill in the use of the pencil and colors, both in the 
drawing of pictures and in the applications of art to home 
decoration and clothes. The child should be led to desire 
to add beauty to whatever work he does. 
The objectives to be sought for in each grade are very 
well described in some of the books referred to at the end 
of the chapter. Particular attention is called to the stand- 
ards as described by Sargent and Miller. These standards 
are worked out in suggestive detail, but are too long for 
quotation. 
Diagnosis and Correctives. As in spelling and in hand- 
writing, so in drawing it is a routine part of the teacher’s 
duties to discover the mistakes the children make in their 
drawing and present specific correctives for them. This 
is easy to do because little children love to draw and paint.
-P-A-G-E-203
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 187 
In doing this they obviously make mistakes and the teacher 
corrects these one by one. Unfortunately no lists of diffi- 
culties, such as those found in language and spelling, have 
been printed by the teachers of art, and therefore each in- 
structor has to make his own diagnosis. 
A course of study based upon diagnosis is said to have 
a psychological organization as opposed to the logical 
organization. If a course of study is organized logically 
the elements of drawing will follow one another in logical 
sequence. In that case we should probably teach lines 
first, then circles, combined with color mixing, to be followed 
by other principles and elements, so that finally having 
learned the technique the children may be able to draw 
something. ‘This corresponds in reading to teaching the 
letters first, then words, and then sentences. Upon this 
plan drawing was taught in the schools for many years. 
To-day, however, it is not organized in this way because 
that is not the way in which children learn best. They 
are not greatly interested in lines, curves, and colors. 
They are intensely interested in drawing when they can 
use it for its intrinsic purpose; they love to draw where the 
drawing expresses some idea of their own. If they are 
asked to draw a picture of what they think or know they 
draw gladly, although their lines and colors are probably 
very faulty. The drawings of children in the primary grades 
are as inartistic as their conversation is ungrammatical. 
So the method of teaching drawing exactly parallels the 
method of teaching language. The teacher lets the pupils 
draw and makes corrections as they are needed. 
There can be no logical order of presentation of drawing 
technique. The order is psychological. Facts and methods 
concerning drawing are introduced as they are needed. The 
children draw to express interesting ideas and the teacher 
corrects at the psychological moment.  
-P-A-G-E-204
188 DRAWING 
The Elements of Drawing. To express ideas through 
drawing we have certain forms, just as in language we have 
words, punctuation marks, grammatical rules, and the 
conventions of spelling. There are two fields in drawing — 
representation and design. The former deals with the 
representation of ideas already found in nature, and the 
latter is concerned with the creation of new ideas to express 
experiences not reproduced from nature. These correspond 
in a general way to the forms of language known as ex- 
position, narration, description, and argument. 
There are also three tools that are used in both rep- 
resentation and design. These are tone, color, and form. 
Color is composed of the five fundamental colors—red, 
yellow, blue, green, violet. Tone refers to lightness and 
darkness, and form is self-explanatory. That is, to express 
any idea it is necessary to use some color, to give it some 
shape, and some degree of brightness or dullness. Then, 
as said above, the foregoing are combined according to the 
laws of composition in each field. These laws are known 
as the laws of balance, rhythm, and harmony, and are dis- 
cussed in any work on art for teachers. 
Each of these rules and items is intended to make the 
technique of art better and consequently the artist who 
wishes to express his ideas faithfully on canvas must utilize 
them as the case requires, from moment to moment. Be- 
cause of this, the pupil who seeks to become an effective 
artist must be taught all these rules and items if his efforts 
are not to be in vain. The extent to which they can be 
taught in the grades is determined, in the last analysis, by 
the mental and manual maturity of the children. It is 
futile to introduce refinements of technique which the 
children cannot understand. i 
Summary. Drawing is organized in such a way that by follow- 
ing its rules the student may learn to express himself with effec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
SUBJECT-MATTER 189 
tiveness. But the degree to which this effectiveness can be given 
in the grades is dependent upon the maturity of the children. 
Illustrative Drawing. One of the most fundamental prob- 
lems in the teaching of art is the provision of ideas which 
the children may express in pictorial form. When we 
study the pictures of great artists we find that some are 
drawn, not so much for the ideas as for the technique which 
they represent. An artist may draw a picture to exemplify 
a new method of getting some effect in color. Clearly, 
such technical studies cannot be used in the grades. Again, 
when we study pictures, we find that the master has at- 
tempted to express the feelings of a mature person. Ob- 
viously children cannot appreciate these. What we have 
to find are simple ideas that are within the comprehension 
and field of interest of the children. 
For this purpose the best field is the illustration of themes, 
a field which has been very well worked out by Sargent and 
Miller. The possibilities of illustrative work are unlimited. 
As we run over their book, which is listed at the end of the 
chapter, we find that their children in the study of Indian 
life in the first grade sketched wigwams, etc., and made 
drawings of such phases of Indian life as hunting, cooking, 
and fishing. In addition they worked out designs for the 
cover of their “Indian Book.” They drew designs of 
Indian pottery and costumes. In the second grade, in con- 
nection with work upon the Arab, the children drew pictures 
of camels, palm trees, and tents, illustrations for original 
stories and covers and designs. In the third grade the 
Vikings were studied and illustrations were drawn of ships 
and dragons, weapons, shields, warriors, and landscapes, 
with even some attempts to depict the battles of the Norse- 
men. In the fourth grade they made use of Greek life, in 
the fifth of Roman, and in the sixth grade of pioneer life. 
Landscaping of an interesting sort was taught in connection 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 DRAWING 
with geography. The study of the geography of South 
America was made the basis for illustrative work. Maps 
were drawn, and a study was made of the coffee plant. 
Likewise in studying Africa drawings were made by the 
children of the houses, the animals, and the trees of the 
tropical jungles. Literature was used as the basis for 
illustrative drawing. Poems and stories were illustrated. 
The children were asked to select subjects for illustration. 
The possibilities of illustrative drawing are numberless, 
and they are such as can be used by the teacher who knows 
very little about drawing himself. Such a teacher clearly 
cannot develop his pupils into finished artists, but this 
should not prevent him from stimulating the children to 
use the pen, pencil, crayon, and even water colors as a 
medium for expression. Many children have a native 
talent for drawing which develops of its own accord with- 
out instruction, and even the children who do not have 
native talent may gain a great deal of pleasure from their 
attempts to draw, even though the results be relatively 
inartistic. 
Summary. Illustrative drawing is the best means for providing 
the children with subjects for drawing, and it can be used to ad- 
vantage by teachers who have little artistic proficiency. 
Standard Tests. Some attempt has been made to provide 
standard tests for drawing ability. One of these is the test 
by Kline and Cary which provides graded scales for testing 
ability in representation. In one scale a house is used as 
the subject, in the second a rabbit, in the third a running 
boy, while in the fourth the subject is a brush drawing of 
a tree. These scales are arranged in twenty steps. How- 
ever, so far as the inexperienced teacher is concerned, the 
standard tests are largely of academic interest. They are 
not worked out to a stage where they can be used with the 
‘ same practical efficiency as handwriting and spelling scales. 
   
-P-A-G-E-207
  
TEACHING DRAWING 191 
The Teacher Who Cannot Draw. I do not think it is wise 
for the teacher who has not studied drawing under a good 
instructor to attempt to teach it. But even though he 
cannot teach the technique of drawing, he can perform two 
very useful functions. In the first place, as has just been 
said, he can encourage the children to illustrate their ideas 
by means of the pencil. Obviously, in arithmetic the 
children can, with advantage, draw plats and diagrams 
while in literature, geography, and history, they can illus- 
trate in black and white the scenes which are presented 
through the medium of language. In the second place, he 
can perform the most important function of all in teaching 
the appreciation of art. In life outside of school there are 
a thousand people who appreciate pictures to one who is 
a skilled artist. Consequently, when children leave school 
they may get a great deal of enjoyment out of pictures even 
though they cannot draw a line. A teacher who cannot 
draw, but who knows how to study pictures, is of more use 
to society than one who can draw excellently but cannot 
develop in the children a love for good pictures. Between 
the expert teachers of art and those with absolutely no 
ability, the great majority of teachers lie. That is to say, 
there are many teachers with a love of beauty in art who 
have not received instruction in the subject. For these 
teachers, the task of developing appreciation is compara- 
tively easy, because their natural love for the subject will 
lead them to get such an understanding of the simple 
principles of balance, rhythm, and harmony, as will enable 
them to explain to the children why some pictures are good 
and others are inartistic. SS 
2. Teaching Drawing 
Motivation. As we have seen in former chapters there 
are usually three possibilities in finding the motive for  
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 DRAWING 
drawing. Young children all have an immediate interest 
in drawing. They like to use the pencil and draw the 
human form, plants, animals, and scenes. In the latter 
grades their higher standards of discrimination, which lead 
them to be somewhat ashamed of their work, cause the 
interest in drawing to weaken. But this interest can be 
kept alive through mediate interest, by having them use 
the pencil and the brush to make clear those ideas which 
they wish to express. Of course, in the drawing class it is 
always possible to appeal to such generic motives as the 
making of good grades. 
Most important of all in stimulating interest in drawing 
is the selection of interesting subjects. The interest in 
drawing is exactly parallel with the interest in language. 
In the case of language children chatter and talk with 
volubility and in drawing they scribble and draw inter- 
minably. Just as in the case of language, facility of drawing 
comes only with much practice. Children should be given 
almost unlimited opportunity. We frequently allow 
children to draw by themselves to keep them quiet, and 
consider that otherwise it is a waste of time. It is not. 
While a boy is drawing he is getting more education than 
if he were learning to spell “phthisis” if he is expressing 
what he feels and sees, and he is gaining such facility in 
doing so that if he be given practice enough with the proper 
instruction he will eventually rather turn to his pencil 
to sketch an idea than describe it in words. While in 
the primary grades children can do little but illustrate 
ideas, illustrations should not be confined to these grades 
alone. Iam a firm believer in the plan of making draw- 
ing a part of every assignment that can be illustrated in 
every grade. 
Nature also provides a great mass of interesting sub- 
jects. Children like to draw animals, they enjoy the 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  TEACHING DRAWING 193 
tracing of leaves, the massing of trees, the filling in of 
landscapes in color. Huge lists of these subjects can be 
found in any textbook on drawing. Then, too, special 
occasions provide material for drawing. Washington’s 
Birthday, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and 
May Day, all produce a strong motive, not only for drawing 
but for other forms of construction work. The decoration 
of the schoolroom is likewise interesting. In the autumn, 
leaves, trees, branches, grain, and corn may be used. In 
placing these objects around the room, upon the walls, and 
in receptacles, much good study of design and decoration 
can be accomplished. The hanging of a new picture 
becomes an occasion for the training of taste and the 
selection of blackboard drawings or stencils seem 
training in artistic standards. 
Summary. The selection of interesting topics for drawing is 
probably the most important step in gaining interest in the sub- 
ject. All interesting subjects should be canvassed by the teacher 
in making his selections and especially every opportunity for 
graphic illustration should be seized by the teacher whether he 
himself can draw or not. 
Drill. From time to time, as occasion demands, certain 
methods of the subject need to be drilled upon, and in this 
case the rules for habit formation hold good. It is neces- 
sary first of all to get a clear idea of what is to be done. 
Then the teacher should secure attentive repetition in a 
happy atmosphere and the drill should be continued until 
the action becomes automatic. 
Problems and Projects. The foregoing discussion leads 
clearly to a statement that drawing should be taught by the 
problem method, and that projects should be used wherever 
possible. Children do not learn drawing well where they 
are merely given exercises to perform. They do their best 
work when they have some ideas to express and when they
-P-A-G-E-210
194 DRAWING 
  use their thinking powers in expressing them in the most 
satisfactory manner; whether the topic is that of the illus- 
trating of such a subject as Indian life or the drawing of a 
single illustration for a passage in a poem the problem 
method is used. Drawing lends itself particularly well to 
project teaching. For instance, the problem of the deco- 
ration of the schoolroom is a project which can be worked 
out by the class as a whole. The colors to be used, the 
arrangement of the decorations around the walls, and 
numberless other details provide excellent material for 
the study of artistic form. As my mind runs over the 
possibility of the use of problems and projects I am led to 
the conclusion that in drawing, to use the words of Octavius 
Roy Cohen, “there ain’t nothing else but” problems and 
projects. Drawing provides the best possible medium 
for the exemplification of the problem method. The prob- 
lems are simple and natural and the technique of balance, 
rhythm, and harmony and the other principles of drawing 
can be brought in incidentally at the psychological moment, 
to an extent that cannot be approached in any other 
subject. 
Teaching Technique. I shall make no attempt to present 
the technique of drawing in this chapter. If the teacher 
has learned the technique under a good instructor, sug- 
gestions are unnecessary. If he has not learned the 
technique under these conditions, it is impossible within 
the limit of the space at my disposal to teach it to him. 
What I must be content with here is to present the won- 
derful opportunities that the teacher has to open up to 
the children the great field of art, in such a way that even 
under the limited possibilities of the schoolroom they may 
secure a kind of pleasure and enjoyment that money cannot 
buy and effort cannot produce. This leads naturally to a 
discussion in the next section of the study for appreciation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  STUDY FOR APPRECIATION 195 
3. Study for Appreciation 
More important than technique in drawing is artistic 
appreciation, for while, as said above, few people continue 
to draw after leaving school, and hence have little practical 
use for this ability, everybody is surrounded by pictures 
and other forms of art. Everybody may enjoy pictures. 
In the poorest hut you will find a few pictures. In the 
plains, in the mountains, in attics and basement hovels, 
the searcher will find some form of pictorial art and deco- 
ration. Yet few people know good pictures and good art. 
Upholstered monstrosities, colors that clash, cheap chromos 
and sentimental catchpennies decorate the walls of lovers 
of pictures who are not lovers of the artistic. This is the 
problem of the teacher — to lead the pupils to enjoy good 
» pictures and artistic decorations. 
Methods of Teaching Appreciation. First, if the teacher 
wishes to get pupils to appreciate good pictures, he must 
choose the pictures carefully. Not all artistic pictures are 
interesting pictures. Many people exclaim over some of 
the old masters, merely because they are told that they are 
old masters. Probably fifty per cent of all classical pictures 
have no more than historical interest, and consequently the 
teacher who surrounds his pupils with “good” pictures 
which elicit no enthusiasm from the children must not 
complain if he has given no consideration to their subjects. 
Pictures may please for two reasons. The subject may 
please, or the work may be artistic. It is, of course, easy to 
find a picture whose subject is pleasing, but whose work- 
manship is poor, just as it is easy to find a piece of artistic 
work with a very uninteresting subject. But since children | 
cannot clearly distinguish between what pleases them in 
content and what is artistic in form, it is necessary to select 
from good pictures those whose subjects are pleasing.
-P-A-G-E-212
    196 DRAWING 
This should, as far as possible, be done by the children 
themselves. Suppose, for instance, that the teacher has 
raised the money to buy a dozen of the medium-size Perry 
pictures, 6x 10 inches in size. In sending for them, the 
teacher should let the children select from the catalogue, 
for even though the catalogue pictures are small the 
children can get from them a good idea of the large ones. 
It is very surprising, when you allow children to make 
selections from a group of pictures, to find that they will 
select to a rather remarkable degree not only pictures 
which are pleasing in subject, but which at the same time 
are on the whole the best from an artistic standpoint. 
Copies of good pictures are so cheap that no school can 
be excused from having many of the best in albums and on 
the walls. It costs a little to buy good frames, but some- 
times the boys can make artistic frames in the manual 
training class, or if not, the pictures may be placed in 
albums made from old geographies, or bought for the 
purpose. The atmosphere of the schoolroom should be 
pervaded with the charm which emanates from beautiful 
prints and pictures. 
Second, when the pupil is surrounded by good pictures 
there is a likelihood of his unconsciously absorbing good 
taste in pictures, so that poor pictures come to displease. 
But it is necessary for the teacher in developing apprecia- 
tion to point out through suggestion those pictures which 
are good and those which are bad. The teacher may 
merely affirm or say, “This is a good picture” or “That is 
a bad picture” and the children will accept his idea. Chil- 
dren get their ideals very largely, but not entirely, from 
. the opinions of those in whom they have confidence. In 
the early years artistic appreciation is, to a great extent, 
built upon the opinions of others. Third, in addition, the 
children may be given problems to Solve, which will compel
-P-A-G-E-213
  STUDY FOR APPRECIATION 197 
them to distinguish between the good and the bad. Such 
problems are easy to find. For instance, the teacher may set 
the children the problem of finding for a given space such 
a picture as will produce a quiet effect. This leads the 
pupils to select the quiet rather-than the gaudy. They 
pass judgment upon all the pictures coming under their 
eyes and distinguish among them according to whether 
they are garish or quiet. At the same time the teacher 
may lead them to say and believe that the quiet effect is 
more pleasing. In the lower grades he will find that the 
children enjoy the flamboyant pictures, but by patient 
effort on the part of the teacher quieter tones can be made 
to displace in their judgment the more pronounced com- 
binations of color. Fourth, often, too, the liking for good 
pictures will be enhanced if the children are taught a story 
about the picture. To tell imaginative stories about a 
picture to little children heightens their love for it. To 
pick out interesting details in the picture also increases 
interest. The little angels in a Fra Lippo Lippi picture 
are often the first tie to bind little children to it. Fifth, 
picture study can be correlated with language and literature 
study. In this correlation the content of the picture is 
analyzed. For instance, in studying the content of Watts’s 
Sir Galahad, one composition book deals with it thus. It 
first shows the picture, then it tells the story of King 
Arthur and his Knights. It then asks for the meanings 
of the words in the story which bring out the meaning of 
the picture. For instance, courteous, vow, solemn, shrine, 
fearless, gentle, high-spirited, charger, shield, etc. Then 
follow a few questions asking to what the life of the knight 
was pledged, how he took his vow of knighthood, ete. The 
armor of the knight and the harness of the horse are care- 
fully noted. Nothing is said about balance, rhythm, and 
harmony, as might have been done in the study of the
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 DRAWING 
picture from the point of view of artistic appreciation. 
The lesson merely gets the children interested in Sir Galahad 
so that the atmosphere of this picture, which is artistically 
good, may be pleasing to them. Sizth, the discussion of a 
picture as a work of art deepens appreciation. Children 
may be asked whether they like the picture or not. If 
some of them do they can state the reasons for their liking. 
The teacher may give his opinion and when he states his 
reason may lead the children on to a fuller discussion of the 
principles of construction which were used. Children who 
do not like it may state their reasons, and the supporters 
of the picture may answer their objections if they can be 
answered. 
It is an interesting psychological fact that if we can 
commit people on any subject the mere commitment 
makes their opinions stronger. For instance, a boy who 
has been indifferent to a picture may grow to like it, and 
by liking, notice it more attentively if he can be led to say 
that it is a good picture. We are surrounded in life with 
many things which are worth while to us but which we do 
not recognize as being valuable until we are asked to make 
some decision about their value. The farmer may not 
appreciate how good his farm is until given an opportunity 
to sell it, and the boy may not appreciate a toy until asked 
to give it away. So, in the appreciation of pictures, the 
taking of a stand in favor of it and arguing for it actually 
deepens loyalty to it and appreciation of its beauties. 
Summary. In developing appreciation six points are worthy of 
mention. The teacher should select from among the many good 
pictures those which have subjects of interest to the children; he 
should use suggestion with the children; problems may be set 
which lead to the development of discrimination; interest in the 
picture is developed by the telling of stories about it; apprecia- 
tion can be taught through correlation with language and litera- 
ture; and discussions concerning the reason why pictures are good. 
or bad heightens appreciation.

Alternation. Special drawing classes may begin with the 
fifth grade in the country school, but previous to that time 
much illustrative work should be required. The fifth 
grade may alternate with the sixth, and the seventh with 
the eighth, because the children have about equal abilities 
in each case. The course will be determined in great 
measure by the needs of the class from day to day.

CHAPTER VII 
MUSIC 
1. Subject-Matter 
Tue problem of teaching music in schools which do not 
employ supervisors of music is complicated by the fact 
that there are three different types of teachers. There 
are a number of teachers who cannot sing at all, a larger 
number who can sing but have no adequate technical train- 
ing in music, and a third smaller group, who can sing and 
have had satisfactory training in singing and in teaching 
pupils to sing. It is further complicated by the fact that 
very few scientific investigations of methods of teaching 
music have been carried on. The methods of developing 
musical skill have been, to an unusual degree, left in the 
hands of music teachers who are inclined to accept systems 
of musical training rather than study the problems ob- 
jectively to discover the best methods irrespective of the 
system. However, during the past few years the super- 
visors of public school music have been developing a quite 
important body of method, but unfortunately not as much 
of this has been put into print as should have been for the 
good of the teaching profession. 
When I come to discuss methods of teaching music I am 
faced by this difficulty — if a teacher cannot sing or can 
sing but has had no training in the technique of singing, 
it is impossible to present in a chapter such as this a tech- 
nique for teaching the details of music. I have, therefore, 
decided to bear in mind chiefly those people who do not 
have technical training in music and to suggest what might 
be done in such a case for the development of the love of
-P-A-G-E-218
202 MUSIC 
  music in the children and some simple technical skill in rote 
singing. 
This will make the chapter largely one dealing with 
the point of view, and, as such, it will be of use to those 
who are untrained musically and to those who have tech- 
nical skill without a knowledge of the place, function, and 
value of music. 
Music and Reading. The most illuminating standpoint 
from which to study methods of teaching music is that of 
tracing its similarity to reading, for with one or two minor 
exceptions it is exactly similar. 
We saw in the paragraph on reading that there were 
five factors in the reading process. The writer has some- 
thing to say and he expresses this through the medium 
of words. The reader has to decipher the symbols, to use 
the vocal mechanism of oral speech so as to convey to the 
audience the ideas of the writer. Exactly similar is the 
case in music. (1) A musical composer has some feeling 
to express, some idea to present to his public. Beethoven 
sits in the moonlight and is moved to express his feelings in 
the Moonlight Sonata. Music, like literature, is used to 
express some feeling, some idea, some element of value in 
the experience of the one who writes it. (2) It is a medium 
through which the writer expresses his ideas. The musical 
composer who wishes to express ideas and feelings in music 
has two media. He may use sound alone; that is, he may 
sing his feelings or play them upon some instrument; or he 
may write symbols on paper. In either case he follows some 
very definite rules of musical composition, rules which are 
just as definite as those of English composition. If he de- 
cides to write his music he has to use a musical “alphabet” 
consisting of notes, staves, and clefs. These notes are 
arranged in groups and the groups are arranged in a way 
to express ideas, much as sentences do. 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
SUBJECT-MATTER 203 
These symbols in music are more difficult to master than 
are the verbal symbols. This is so because music adds 
pitch to the verbal element. In the verbal alphabet “b” 
is ““b” wherever it is seen and “c” is quite different in 
sound from it. “Do” as a spoken word sounds quite 
different from “re,”’ but as music it not only sounds differ- 
ent as a word — there is also a difference in pitch. “Do” 
not only sounds different from “re” as a word, but it is an 
interval in pitch lower than “‘re”’ in music. Then, too, the 
written notes do not always mean the same thing. In 
this case += one learns that the notation stands for 
a certain tone.called “‘b natural,” but by a slight 
change, a it is no longer “b natural” but 
“b flat” and is ef a half-tone lower. The task of 
mastering the symbols of music is therefore rather com- 
plicated. This is particularly true of those people who do 
not possess a fine sense for tone. They may know “do” 
from “re” as spoken but may not be able to.place “do” at 
one pitch and separate it from “re” with one interval be- 
tween. Such people are called “‘monotones.” The number 
of these who can never distinguish one tone from another 
in pitch is very small. Most so-called monotones fail to 
distinguish the pitch of notes simply because of lack of 
training. 
—The third factor, after the composer has expressed his 
ideas, is the deciphering of these symbols. The musical 
“reader”? must be able to read the symbols, interpret their 
meaning, and relive the experience of the writer so that he 
may think his thoughts, and feel his feelings after him. 
In reading music the fourth factor is the control of the 
vocal mechanism composed of such organs as the tongue, 
palate, teeth, lips, vocal cords, lungs, and diaphragm. 
In singing (and it is of this alone that I shall speak) the 
same organs are used in a slightly different way from that    
     
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 MUSIC 
used in reading, inasmuch as pitch enters into musical ex- 
pression. Finally, there is an audience which the reader 
hopes to bring into accord with his feelings and those of the 
writer. The singer tries to make his audience feel what he 
feels and what the composer felt as the singer understands 
it. 
Summary. There are three things to observe in teaching sing- 
ing. These are: (1) a set of symbols to be mastered, (2) a vocal 
mechanism to be brought under control, and (3) a musical reader 
or interpreter who will try to get at the meaning of the composer 
and will then interpret it to an audience. The same factors hold 
in the handling of instrumental music. 
The Function of Music. There is one noticeable distinc- 
tion between the function of music and the function of 
spelling, or handwriting, or reading. These are not of any 
particular use in themselves; they are tools to be used in 
doing something that we want to do. In spelling and 
handwriting the important element is the idea that we 
want to express, and these subjects are of signal importance 
to the ideas. Music, on the other hand, does not take a 
place secondary to any other subject. We do not learn 
music because we want to be better citizens or earn a living. 
We study music for its own sake. We sing because of the 
enjoyment gotten out of singing. We listen to music 
because we like to listen to it. In short, when we come 
to consider music we see a subject which is one of the 
fundamental subjects of experience. We have no reason 
for enjoying music outside of itself and enjoyment of music 
is sufficient reason for the study of it. In this respect it is 
exactly like literature. We read literature for one chief 
reason, and that is to enjoy reading literature. This en- 
joyment in both music and literature is partly intellectual, 
partly emotional, and partly esthetic, for just as we 
express ideas in zesthetic form in an emotional atmosphere, 
the composer of music expresses ideas, though less definite
-P-A-G-E-221
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 205 
ideas, in esthetic form with an emotional atmosphere. 
The participator in music gets his full reward from the 
enjoyment that he gets out of the ideas, feelings, and beauty 
which the composer felt and tried to express. 
Summary. The function of music is to provide the enjoyment 
that comes. from the expression of ideas and feelings in tones 
which obey the laws of beauty. 
Ideals. There are three ideals that are particularly im- 
portant in the study of music in the schools. The first of 
these is appreciation of the beautiful in music. It is not 
sufficient for children to be able to sing or to read notes, 
for it is possible to be able to do both of these and still 
possess a marked lack of appreciation of music. Moreover, 
it is possible for a person to possess a very keen appreciation 
of music without being able to sing or play with any tech- 
nical perfection. Where there is one person who is a good. 
technical performer, there are a thousand who belong to 
his audience. A nation may be filled with a love of music 
and have only a handful of superior artists. Yet where 
a nation is filled with lovers of music there will be thousands 
and tens of thousands of people who can sing and play a 
little and who get their musical enjoyment chiefly from 
listening and partly from amateur participation. It will 
thus be seen that even where a school does not turn out 
professional singers and instrumentalists it is possible under 
intelligent leadership to develop that appreciation of music 
which is even more important socially and nationally than 
technical skill in music. 
The second ideal is that of accuracy in the reading of 
music and in voice control in singing. If the teacher is 
trained in music and seeks to teach the children to read 
music, he must realize the importance of accuracy, at least 
in tone production. It is much worse for a child to misplace 
a tone than to mispronounce or misspell a word.  
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 MUSIC 
Closely connected with the ideal of accuracy is the ideal 
of speed. For, if the child is actually to use the reading 
of notes as a means of learning a tune, he must be able to 
read with speed as well as with appreciation. If he does 
not have this speed of reading, the problem of acquiring the 
tune through reading by himself is so discouraging that he 
does not try to do it. Unless pupils can read music almost 
as speedily as they can read words, or at least speedily 
enough so that they will not grow discouraged, there is not 
a great deal of use in trying to teach them to read at all. 
The parallel with the reading of words is close. We saw, 
in silent reading, that if the pupil did not have speed in 
reading, he would never read when he left school, but 
would depend for his ideas upon conversation with other 
people who, possibly, could read. So, if the child is unable 
to read music with speed, he will sing entirely by rote as 
he catches the tune from other people. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. The teacher has two objec- 
tives in teaching music. The first of these is the develop- 
ment of the appreciation and love for music. If children 
study music for eight years and do not enjoy it, or if they 
positively dislike it, there has unquestionably been a com- 
plete waste of the time that has been spent upon the subject 
in school. It would have been better if the subject had 
been struck out of the course of study. The methods of 
developing this appreciation will be discussed at the proper 
place in the chapter. The second objective of the teacher 
who is trained in the teaching of music is developing skill 
in singing and this skill is composed of two factors which 
we have mentioned — accuracy in reading and voice manip- 
ulation, and speed in deciphering the symbols of music. ; 
Standards. In brief, the standard by which to judge of 
the excellence of school music is exemplified in a roomful of 
children, who love to sing beautiful songs, are able to sing 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  
~~ 
SUBJECT-MATTER 207 
them with good expression and by note, and enjoy listening 
to good music. A class that enjoys listening to good music 
is scored high, a more efficient class is one that not only 
enjoys listening to music but sings by rote, loves its songs 
and sings them with expression. A class that can do 
these things and sing by note is rated still higher. A class 
that sings by note, but does not seem to enjoy it and does 
not give good expression to the songs, is not graded so high 
as one that sings sweetly and with good expression. 
Course of Study. The course of study in music consists 
of three elements. The first of these is an appreciation of 
music which increases through all the grades. It is par- 
ticularly and chiefly an attitude toward music that is built 
up by the teacher in connection with every beautiful song. 
It is in part secured by lessons which are called “apprecia- 
tion lessons,” but such lessons cannot take the place of an 
appreciative attitude toward every song that is sung. 
Indeed, appreciation lessons are frequently found to be 
very formal. The second element in the course of study 
is what is known as rote singing. This is carried on through- 
out the grades, and is used exclusively at first, just as 
conversation is used before the study of language and 
grammar begins, and just as in the case of language it is 
carried on throughout the grades. The third element of 
the course of study is note singing in which the children 
learn to decipher symbols and express them adequately. 
This naturally divides itself into the reading of notes and 
the control of the voice. 
The teacher who is not technically trained in music can 
work in the first two of these fields if he has a love for 
music himself and can express, however inadequately, his 
own appreciation, and lead the children to express and 
discuss their appreciation of the songs. He can also, if he 
cannot sing himself, select a good singer from the older 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 MUSIC 
children to lead the singing. Indeed, when there is no 
such person in the school, arrangements have been made 
by rural school teachers for the voluntary help of some 
person in the community who is very much interested in 
singing. Lack of technical training in music is no excuse for 
the teacher’s failure to get the children to love good music. 
He is handicapped, to be sure, but at least if he cannot be 
the teacher of music he can be the administrator who gets 
some one to teach it for him. 
There are a number of points that a teacher with no 
technical knowledge of music can watch. It is possible for 
him to tell whether children sing harshly or sweetly, whether 
they sing too loudly or with muffled voices; he can also tell 
whether they sing lifelessly or with enjoyment. Upon such 
points as these he can influence the rote singing of the 
children even where the instruction is poor, as when carried 
on by an older pupil. Such a teacher, obviously, cannot 
teach note singing. Yet the loss is not so great as it would 
be if the teacher made no attempt to develop a love for 
music. Good rote singing is immeasurably better than no 
singing at all. 
The details of the organization of the course of study are 
described in the references at the end of the chapter. There 
is no more unanimity concerning the content of the course 
of study in music than there is in literature. It has to 
be constructed according to principles rather than upon 
detailed studies. The same principles hold as in literature. 
The music studied should be interesting to the children at 
the ages when they study it. It should not be too difficult 
for them to comprehend and master. Moreover, it should 
be good music. The problem of the teacher becomes that 
of selecting from the best music that which is interesting 
and reasonably easy. Good music can be drawn from 
several sources. At once we think of classical music, and
-P-A-G-E-225
  SUBJECT-MATTER 209 
in it there are many very beautiful compositions which 
children may enjoy much more than ragtime or jazz. 
There are the folk songs which have stood the test of the 
ages, by people who, while not technically proficient in 
music, love it deeply. In addition there are modern songs 
and popular songs which obey the rules of musical com- 
position and good taste, just as there is a modern literature 
which is just as worthy of being read as is the literature 
written by men who have long been dead. There is no 
objection to popular music as such. It comes and goes. 
Some of it gives temporary enjoyment and some of it lives 
for years. The teacher, therefore, has a wide field from 
which to select, according to the principles of interest, 
degree of difficulty, and beauty. 
The music books adopted for the school naturally con- 
tain many good selections, but these should be studied by 
the teacher to see that the songs taught in a particular 
grade are interesting to the grade, that difficult selections 
should follow less difficult, and particularly that supple- 
mentary material be introduced from .other sources. He 
can at least have two or three sets of music books by differ- 
ent authors because these cost very little and can be used 
as a basis for note as well as rote singing. In general, of 
course, the inexperienced teacher will depend largely upon 
the textbook in music. Upon the whole, the wisdom and 
experience of the writer is greater than that of the inex- 
perienced teacher, but as time goes on, the teacher is able, 
through concrete experience, to form his opinions as to 
interest and difficulty. 
Testing. Within recent years very rapid strides have 
been made in testing the ability of pupils in music. This 
has been accomplished almost exclusively through the work 
of Professor Seashore of the University of Iowa. It is 
possible, by the use of test material arranged for use on
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 MUSIC 
phonograph disks, to test a pupil’s sense of pitch, intensity, 
time, extensity, rhythm, timbre, consonance, volume, and 
soon. This is of very great use to parents who are in doubt 
about whether to give their children a musical education 
or not, and is of value to teachers in diagnosing the diffi- 
culties of children in mastering the technique of music. 
The tests can be purchased through the Columbia 
Graphophone Company. Obviously, they will be of use 
only to teachers who are technically trained in music, but 
for such they are of very great value when used from the 
fifth grade on. I recall one case in which there were two 
daughters and a son ina family. The daughters were being 
given an intensive musical education while the boy was 
not receiving any instruction; yet the test revealed the 
fact that the boy’s musical ability was quite superior while 
that of the girls was so inferior that the excessive time 
they spent upon music was largely wasted. For the sake 
of those trained teachers who are interested in testing, it 
may be mentioned that Professor Seashore has described 
his tests and the underlying theory in his book, The Psy- 
chology of Musical Talent, published by Silver, Burdett & 
Company. 
2. Interest 
Here again the parallel between reading and music will 
furnish us with our method. The first essential in getting 
a motive for oral or silent reading is to have material that 
is of value. Likewise, the first essential in getting interest 
in music is to have songs that are interesting to children. 
Music teachers frequently do not present songs as virile 
as they should be for boys, or as grown-up ‘as the case 
demands. Very often the songs are obviously manufac- 
tured for use as class exercises and may be neither very 
good nor very interesting.
-P-A-G-E-227
  INTEREST 211 
Interest in music is immediate. The children like it for 
its own sake and all children like to sing up to the time 
when their deficiencies become apparent. The real prob- 
lem of the teacher is to maintain throughout the grades 
in the face of the difficulties of changing voices and self- 
consciousness the interest which is present in the primary 
grades, 
It is held by some teachers that interest in rote singing 
wanes unless technical instruction is given, but obviously 
this cannot be natural because most people pick up their 
music by rote. The cause is to be sought elsewhere, and 
is due to the fact that the songs which the children learn 
by rote are not sufficiently interesting nor sufficiently 
varied. The decrease of interest may be due to the singing 
of a narrow range of songs so often that they become too 
familiar and trite. 
Upon this immediate interest in music is built the interest 
in singing by note. Just as one learns to read best when 
he has an interesting content to decipher for himself, so 
the pupils learn to read music best when the content upon 
which they work is interesting. If the reward secured by 
the labor put upon reading notes is something that is very 
beautiful and new to them, or even beautiful and familiar, 
the speed at which they learn to read by note is greatly 
increased. The teacher can never wisely forget for a 
moment the fact that his main business in this subject is 
to keep the children interested. 
The audience idea can be used to stimulate interest. If 
children are allowed individually or in groups to learn good 
songs at home and bring them to school to sing to the other 
boys and girls who do not know the songs much interest is 
aroused. Or if they can learn to sing songs at school and 
sing them to an interested audience at home, interest is 
stimulated.
-P-A-G-E-228
212 MUSIC 
Summary. Interest in music is immediate; little children love 
to sing by rote and note singing is built upon this interest. The 
giving of pleasure to other people through singing heightens this 
interest, which is naturally felt. 
The Social Phase of Music. While it is true that music 
is primarily studied for its own sake, it is nevertheless 
equally true that it has a very definite influence upon people 
who live in groups. We have long known and repeated the 
epigram, “Let me make the songs of a nation and I care not 
who shall make its laws,” but we have been slow to realize 
the full significance of this statement. 
The social value of music is brought out very aptly by 
Surette, who says: 
Now, the possibilities in music to weld together socially dis- 
organized communities have never been fully realized in America. 
Were we to set about using it directly to that end we should find 
out how valuable it is in breaking down artificial barriers. By 
choral singing, people in any one locality can be brought into a 
certain sympathy with each other. Groups who attend the same 
church, the fathers and mothers of children whom the settlements 
reach — wherever there is a “neighborhood” there is a chance for 
singing. It needs only a person who believes in it and who will 
rigidly select only the best music. Any great gathering of people 
would find everybody ready to take part in choral singing. This 
would make community music a reality, and would doubtless so 
foster the love of the art as eventually to affect the whole musical 
situation. Any one who has ever had personal experience of 
bringing fine music to those who cannot afford to attend concerts 
knows that such people are as keen for the best as are those who 
can afford it.   Community leaders with a vision of the school as a social 
center place very great reliance upon music. Particularly 
in small communities musical and literary programs are 
given periodically by the school because parents are will- 
ing to come to hear their children when they would 
come for no other reason. Somewhat more difficult, but 
frequently more enjoyable, are musical plays that are 
staged by the teacher or some other musical leader in the
-P-A-G-E-229
  INTEREST 213 
community and are rendered by the children and interested 
adults. The phonograph, owned or borrowed by the school, 
with records carefully selected as to both excellence and 
interest, often used alone and sometimes in combination 
with other numbers, is a convenient aid to an enjoyable 
evening’s entertainment well advertised in advance by the 
pupils. An evening of community singing, with or without 
the addition of readings or phonograph records, has, on 
innumerable occasions, drawn a crowded house, for while 
adults enjoy listening to music they are still more interested 
in singing familiar and beloved songs under the inspiration 
of a good leader. New songs, the latest and the best, are 
quickly learned and the school which gets a reputation for 
being a place where one can learn the latest musical hits will 
not be lacking in attendance at its evening assemblies. 
Then, too, the school can easily advance from these home 
affairs to the importation of talent upon occasion. But 
always the foundation of the musical and social center is 
the active participation of the people of the community in 
their own musical enterprises. 
Music is of use not only to the community. It is in- 
dispensable to the school. A few minutes spent in song or 
in listening to enjoyable music, brightens the atmosphere, 
raises the tone of activity, cheers the discouraged, and 
quiets the unruly. Merely as an aid to discipline it is 
invaluable and as an adjunct to physical exercises it is not 
to be neglected. On the march, the lagging steps of tired 
soldiers quicken to the strains of martial music. In the 
factory the product of labor is increased, and on the ship- 
ping platform the strain of effort is lessened by rhythmic 
chants and melodies. The bickerings of individuals dis- 
appear under the influence of gentle music and the dis- 
appointed are raised to heights of optimism. Nowhere is 
there a more powerful stimulus to social cohesion and unity
-P-A-G-E-230
214 MUSIC 
than participation in familiar songs and attention to the 
rendition of beloved numbers. 
The effort to develop a love for music with its attendant 
values lays emphasis upon rote singing, for, as has been 
said, many people enjoy music who have no ability to read 
it. Children can be “told” songs just as they are told 
stories, Not to be able to read words is a calamity because 
there is so much to learn that can be found only in print, 
so inability to read musical literature narrows the musical 
experience of children. Naturally, since the number of 
musical compositions is much smaller than the amount of 
verbal literature, it is less necessary to be able to read 
music than to read words. It is desirable that children be 
able to read the notes but it is essential that they learn 
many good songs by rote. 
Summary. The essential aim of the teaching of music is de- 
velopment of the appreciation of music as literature. Possession 
of a love of music is of both individual and social value, and the 
private possession of a large body of songs and an acquaintance 
with a wide variety of musical compositions are essential to fullest 
appreciation. 
Projects. The project method is at home in music, 
for here we find the natural setting brought into the 
schoolroom. As we have said before, a project is an 
activity carried on in its natural setting, when by natu- 
ral setting we mean a setting which is not different from 
what it would be outside of school because it is handled in 
school. 
The answer to the question, “What is the natural setting 
for music?” is that we have music in its natural setting 
when we listen to it, play it, or sing it for the enjoyment 
that we get out of it. Clearly then, the pupil who reads 
music for enjoyment is carrying on a little musical project, 
or when he sings for an audience because he likes to and 
the audience wants to hear him, he is again carrying on a 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  METHODS OF TEACHING 215 
project. The characteristic of the natural setting in music 
is doing a thing because of the pleasure in it. 
This at once enables us to classify a number of musical 
activities as projects. The simplest project is one in which 
the child sings, plays, or reads music for his own enjoyment, 
but in addition to that we have such musical projects as 
community gatherings for which the children may prepare. 
To these are added entertainments for children in other 
rooms, for parents, or on Friday afternoons for themselves. 
Likewise there are out-of-door and indoor concerts to be 
given. Under more expert direction pageants may be 
staged and contests put on between schools. All of these 
are projects and have a definite place and great value in 
developing a love for music and the pleasure that comes 
from giving pleasure to others. 
3. Methods of Teaching 
Appreciation. No thoroughgoing technique for the de- 
velopment of appreciation in music has been worked out as 
yet, but there are a number of suggestions developed by 
teachers of music which have been found to be valuable in 
developing a love of music. In the first place, mere ex- 
posure to pleasing music tends to develop a love for it 
without any training’ in appreciation. If children are 
brought into contact with good music through singing or 
through the phonograph they may unconsciously become 
attached to it and even learn to recognize the difference 
between the satisfaction that they get out of jazz and the 
deeper satisfaction that comes from good music. Because 
of the fact that mere exposure may develop love for good 
music, any teacher, whether trained in music or not, should 
see to it that by voluntary subscription or by purchase by 
the school board the schoolroom is equipped with a phono- 
graph and interesting records. These records must be
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 MUSIC 
selected with extreme care, for many of them have been 
made for adults and not all of them are of interest to 
children. Moreover, they should be selected for the prim- 
ary children as well as for the older children. Some 
teachers go so far as to order a number of good records 
from the nearest dealer and allow the children to vote on 
those they like the best, with a view to returning those 
that are less well liked. No single factor will have so great 
an influence upon developing a musical America as the 
phonograph, and the school has a duty of unmistakable 
clearness in seeing that it is used to its full advantage. 
In the second place, it is pointed out by the experts in 
music in the public schools that the teacher’s own appre- 
ciation and ability to influence the pupils in their apprecia- 
tion, plays a very important part in developing the proper 
attitude. The teacher’s preferences show through his 
voice, his manner, and his remarks, and these preferences 
and judgments the children quickly absorb. Perhaps the 
teacher’s appreciation may be misplaced but probably it 
will not be. In any case, all that he needs to do is to be 
sincere in his expressions. He has a perfect right to in- 
fluence the children in music in the same way that he 
influences them in morals or mathematics. Nor should 
he lack confidence in expressing these preferences, because 
all that he needs to be saved is to be fifty-one per cent right. 
He can trust the children as they grow older to form their 
own true opinions and natural attitudes. 
In the third place, teachers quite commonly discuss what 
the children like about the selections. The teacher leads 
them to recall the part of the air that was particularly 
pleasing or to call for its rendition again on the phonograph, 
while pointing out again the particular part which he 
prefers. The teacher may also render the phrasing in 
slightly different ways to show the children the difference
-P-A-G-E-233

that the rendition makes. In other words, appreciation 
can be developed by using one’s reasoning in the study of 
music, and indeed it is held by expert critics that musical 
appreciation of the highest type is both emotional and 
intellectual. Music which appeals only to the feelings is 
called emotional. The best music appeals to both the 
head and the heart, and since this is the case, teachers are 
justified in having the children discuss music, reason about 
it, and even at times argue over it. 
In the fourth place, appreciation for music is developed 
by the securing of information about the author, the con- 
ditions under which the music was written, etc. Although 
this is carried too far by many teachers who think that 
appreciation consists merely in securing this information, 
it has a very valuable place. There are a number of great 
composers whose names should be as familiar as those of 
statesmen, warriors, and authors. They have contributed 
as much as these to the life of the nation and their names 
should be recognized and honored. 
Fifth, and finally, one of the most important ways of de- 
veloping appreciation is through mass singing, either in the 
schoolroom or in choruses or in community gatherings. 
Often this mass singing hurts the ear of the expert because 
some of the children sing markedly out of tune, but practical 
teachers who believe in community singing obviate this in 
part by having the children sing quietly rather than loudly, 
and by paying particular attention to. the discordant to 
see that they materially lower their voices. Yet it must 
not be forgotten that the boy who sings discordantly may 
be developing just as rapidly and deeply a love for music 
as his prim and precise older sister who carries the tune 
without a fault. It is not necessary for the individual to 
be able to sing accurately in order to like to sing. In 
moments of exasperation we sometimes wish that those 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
218 MUSIC 
who sing discordantly realized their difficulties and re- 
frained from singing, but since we are not concerned about 
our own feelings so much as a love for music in the in- 
dividual, this should not be a matter for deep concern. 
Summary. There are at least five ways in which an apprecia- 
tion of music can be developed. Children may be exposed to 
music, the teacher may influence them by his own love and ap- 
preciation of individual selections, discussions may he held and 
preferences stated with the reasons for them, narrative facts 
concerning the composer and the selections may be taught, and 
participation in mass singing may be carried on. 
Suggestions. In concluding the chapter, which professedly 
does not attempt to teach the technique of music teaching 
but lays emphasis upon the contribution that can be made 
by the untrained teacher to the development of a love of 
music, a few technical suggestions drawn from Earhart’s 
surveys mentioned at the end of the chapter may be pre- 
sented. (i) He is definitely of the opinion that monotones 
should not be segregated in the class. It makes them 
conspicuous and ill at ease. They should be given indi- 
vidual attention, inconspicuously, by the teacher at their 
seats. They should participate in all singing by their 
class, but they should be taught to sing softly .and with 
a low voice. (2) Supplementary books of music containing 
many good songs of easy grade, technically, should be pur- 
chased for supplementary use and this song material 
should be treated as sight-singing material, with such com- 
plementary instruction as may be necessary. (3) Pupils 
who play the piano should be sought out and requested to 
play accompaniments, marches, etc., whenever such service 
would contribute to the enjoyment of the pupils. Pupils 
who are studying musical instruments should be requested 
to play occasionally for the class and every effort should be 
made to encourage in the school large and prominent or- 
ganizations of players, of the nature of school or community 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  METHODS OF TEACHING 219 
orchestras. (4) Teachers should understand the voices of 
the boys in the seventh and eighth grades and should help 
them to transfer quickly to the lower octaves and teach 
them that they do not need to cease singing while the 
change is taking place and that it will not harm their 
voices to continue singing while their voices are changing 
provided they do not overexert them. (5) Stereotyped 
definitions that give no indication of musical power and 
afford only a memory test should be discarded and theo- 
retical knowledge of the music being sung should be limited 
to the musical capacity of the pupils. (6) Earhart is of the 
opinion that music appreciation study should not be under- 
taken as a separate type of lesson until at least the eighth 
grade has been reached. Appreciation should be an in- 
formal element in connection with every musical selection 
rather than be confined to separate periods. 
Alternation. It is suggested that all children sing to- 
gether; and that when a book is used, each fourth exercise 
be studied each year. The first, fifth, ninth, etc., the first 
year, and the second, sixth, tenth, etc., the second year. 
This will take the whole class through the book once in 
four years. And since there is much to learn in the way of 
technique and but a short time in which to learn it, the 
repetition for the second four years will probably not be 
felt to any great extent.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
1. Subject-Matter 
Introduction. By the term “industrial arts” is meant those 
arts which change raw materials into useful products. It 
refers to the arts which take cotton, wheat, iron, and 
lumber, and work them up into clothing, food, furniture, 
and utensils. These arts have had a tremendous influence 
upon the course of civilization and taken in their broadest 
applications are the foundations of the material equipment 
of life. Without their skillful application we would to-day 
be in the position of the lowest races of savages. 
The industrial arts are of great significance to education 
for two reasons. In the first place, they are of such great 
social significance that the students should study them for 
the same reason that they study history. No person can 
claim to be completely educated unless he has a considerable 
knowledge of them. In the second place, they easily 
become excellent teaching material in which the problem 
method of study is constantly used. For instance, if we 
take such an art as boat-building, we are able to set the 
problem of transportation on water before the children in 
very simple form in primitive conditions, and lead the 
children to invent a hollow log as a method of transporta-° 
tion, and then proceed step by step from that point through 
the use of oars and sails to the steam turbine with wood, 
coal, and crude oil. 
However, at the present time there is one very serious 
limitation to the teaching of the industrial arts. Teachers
-P-A-G-E-238
  222 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
do not know a very great deal about them. In general 
they do not have even a factual knowledge of the industrial 
arts and know even less about their evolution. This is due 
to the fact that the importance of the industrial arts as a 
factor in social life has not been recognized until recently 
and consequently the teacher has arrived at a point where 
he is expected to teach this subject without having gained 
adequate information either in the elementary school or 
the high school. Moreover, there are very few textbooks 
that have as yet appeared which are definitely available for 
use in the grades. Yet the literature is in itself very in- 
teresting and in some elementary schools, schools for the 
training of teachers, a considerable body of material has 
been collected and is available for teachers who are in- 
terested in broadening their knowledge of this field. Par- 
ticularly valuable is the recent book by Bonser and 
Mossman referred to at the end of the chapter, and from 
it I shall draw a considerable amount of material. 
Summary. A knowledge of the industrial arts and the methods 
used in the field is of great importance to students, but the subject 
has been so recently introduced into the schools that the average 
teacher must depend to a large extent upon his own initiative in 
working up the material in the field. 
Divisions of the Field. Following Bonser and Mossman 
the field may be broken up into six divisions. It is cus- 
tomary to speak of food, clothing, and shelter, as the three 
fundamental needs with which the industrial arts concern 
themselves, but to these are added three others. They do 
not constitute all possible fields, but together represent six 
important fields. (1) In the field of foods we are concerned 
with the study of the art of food preparation by which all 
the raw materials, such as cereals, fruit, vegetables, meats, 
etc., are prepared for human consumption. In this process 
there is the preparation of foods, their selection upon the
-P-A-G-E-239
    
SUBJECT-MATTER 223 
basis of cost and nutritive value, the proper balance of the 
diet, and the preservation of foods. (2) Under clothing are 
considered the arts of spinning, weaving, clothing selection 
and construction, by which cotton, wool, silk, and other 
raw products are changed into the materials which can be 
used for protecting and adorning the body. (3) Under 
shelter are considered the processes of manufacturing, lum- 
bering, iron, copper and glass production, and the con- 
version of raw materials into finished products which pro- 
vide shelter against the elements. (4) Utensils of the home, 
such as dishes, have played such an important part in the 
history of civilization that the knowledge of their evolution 
is of value. (5) In addition to utensils we have the tools 
and implements of the vocations, which have an interesting 
history. And finally (6) Bonser and Mossman include in 
this series of important topics the method of keeping 
records, in the form of books manufactured from paper. 
The public school teacher who wishes-to teach a course 
in the industrial arts should clearly include the first three 
of these fields in the study and may include others, de- 
pending upon the amount of time and the information 
which he is able to secure. 
Ideals. In the teaching of the industrial arts there are 
at least five ideals to which attention needs to be paid. 
(1) Children should be led to appreciate the beauty of 
manufactured materials and to seek for beauty in their 
own products. (2) The ideal of economy of effort, time, 
and money needs to be developed at the proper place since 
they will be essentially purchasers of all of these materials 
but producers of only one, the one in which the vocation of 
each lies. The factors involved in good buying need to be 
highly stressed. (3) Good judgment concerning the ex- 
penditure of money for these products needs to be developed 
as a by-product of the effort to secure economy. (4) Some  
-P-A-G-E-240
224 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
  considerable skill in technique should be developed in the 
upper grades while in the lower grades skill is not sought for 
as much as an understanding of the processes. In the 
seventh and eighth grades the students can hope to become 
somewhat skillful in the preparation of clothing and food 
and in the use of tools in the manual arts. In these grades 
the children should set reasonable skill as an ideal. They 
should be taught not merely to do the things, but to do 
them as perfectly as can reasonably be expected. (5) 
Scholarliness or the desire for a wide knowledge of the in- 
dustrial arts has an important place because of the value 
of the arts to civilization. That is to say, the children 
should be expected not only to have skill in production in 
some of the arts, but they should have an interest in learn- 
ing and remembering facts about raw materials and the 
methods used in their manufacture into the finished 
products. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. The teacher who teaches the 
industrial arts has at least five objectives to keep clearly 
in mind in the teaching of the subject. (1) Fundamentally 
it is important to give the children some conception of 
the place of industry in civilization. (2) Since most of the 
money of men and women is spent in the purchase of the 
products of the industrial arts — i.e., for food, for clothing, 
and for shelter — it is important that children should be 
trained to be thoughtful purchasers and users of these 
products. What foods to buy, what clothing to purchase, 
how to prepare foods, construct clothing, and purchase and 
maintain homes, is of the greatest social and economic 
importance. (8) In order to become thoughtful purchasers 
children need to be reasonably well informed about raw 
materials and the processes of manufacture. (4) Some 
skill in the arts should be developed, not so much for the 
purpose of teaching them how to prepare foods and make
-P-A-G-E-241
  SUBJECT-MATTER 225 
clothing, although that is important, but to give the pupils 
an appreciation of how the processes are carried on. This 
appreciation can be best given, of course, by teaching them 
to perform some of the simpler operations themselves. (5) 
It is highly essential that in all this teaching the problem 
method should be used. It is not sufficient for the children 
to be given facts about the industrial arts; little problems 
should be set for them which they should be given an 
opportunity to solve for themselves. It is because of this 
that the primitive life is of such great importance in the 
curriculum. The children are easily able to construct such 
materials and use such processes as primitive man was able 
to develop. 
The Course of Study. The course of study which is de- 
veloped in the industrial arts is dependent upon two 
factors. The time element is of importance. Obviously 
in the rural school the subject cannot be taught as inten- 
sively as in the large city system. But of greater influence 
is the knowledge of the teacher. Quite clearly the teacher 
who himself possesses little knowledge of the subject has 
to depend largely upon his textbook. If this is meager in 
content he cannot hope to go far beyond it, except as he 
ean pick up information for himself. However, in any 
case, the teacher must plan the course that he is going to 
follow and carry the plan out through the eight years of 
the elementary school. 
Activities. There are four different activities which need 
to be borne in mind in the teaching of the industrial arts. 
(1) The student is to use industrial products. (2) He pre- 
pares and constructs some of them, such as food, clothing, 
and, in the rural communities, many of the tools and 
buildings which are used on the farm. (3) He must buy 
and select the products. For instance, he buys and selects 
raw materials for food and clothing or selects the prepared
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
foods and ready-to-wear clothing. (4) He must also 
maintain and repair these if he is to live economically and 
efficiently. This is particularly true of clothing, utensils, 
tools, and implements. These four activities have to be 
borne in mind in the teaching of the industrial arts. 
The industrial arts are particularly well suited to chil- 
dren because they involve certain natural impulses of the 
children, the expression of which is of very great interest 
to them. Of these there are four. The children in the 
first place have an impulse to manipulative activity which 
leads them to love to make things. They have a wide 
curiosity which leads them to investigate. They have 
considerable interest in beauty of form and color and they 
love to observe what others are doing and to share with 
them in their activities as well as to secure approval and 
help from other people. 
However, in doing this their skill and ability develops. 
Therefore, in grading the work we need to take these 
differences in skill into account. On the physical side little 
children do not have control of the finer muscles, they 
have little strength and consequently they have to be 
given simple and crude things to make, and should not be 
held to a high degree of skill. Later in the course they 
tend to get better control of the finer muscles and a higher 
degree of skill can be required, while at the same time more 
complicated and finer work can be given them to do. On 
the mental side the smaller children are interested in 
working with simple material. They cannot carry out 
projects to any great extent nor are they able to plan so 
well as they can later. Moreover their interest in the prac- 
tical activities of the community is not so well, developed. 
Ability in manual lines grows as time goes on and work 
involving increasingly difficult manual operations can be 
introduced into the grades. Because of this physical and
-P-A-G-E-243
SUBJECT-MATTER 227 
mental growth the grading of the material must be watched 
carefully so that the younger children are not given work 
that is too difficult and uninteresting because of its diffi- 
culty. 
In the grading of material the objects worked out by 
Bonser and Mossman for each grade will be found by the 
teacher to be of great value in determining what the course 
of study should include in each grade. 
Food. (1) In the study of foods we must, as we have said, 
teach the children before they leave the eighth grade some- 
thing about the use of foods. This means particularly that 
they should be given information about the balanced diet 
and be taught the general principles of nutrition. Par- 
ticularly should they have concrete knowledge about the 
balance of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamines, etc., so 
that the family menu may not consist exclusively of starches 
or proteins. This having been taught it is very important 
that they should learn something of the calory, particularly 
in communities where adults do not perform a great deal 
of manual labor. In teaching the facts about calories 
children should be given information about the number of 
calories necessary for the efficient maintenance of life, so 
that there will be no danger of undereating or overeating 
and this information should be so given that the student 
will know approximately how many calories there are in a 
usual serving in the home, of butter, bread, meat, portions 
of pie and cake, etc. (2) Before girls have left the eighth 
grade they should have knowledge, given in the home or at 
school, concerning the preparation and purchase of the 
common foods. They should know whether it is cheaper 
to buy or preserve certain foods such as can be purchased 
in cans, and whether, if it is cheaper, it pays in terms of 
time and effort. But frequently in the cities, where the 
price of raw foods is high, it is clear that canned foods can
-P-A-G-E-244
  228 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
be bought more cheaply than they can be preserved by the 
housewife. On the farm, however, the opposite is prob- 
ably the case, but the girls should figure this out for them- 
selves in terms of actual prices obtaining in the community. 
(8) They should be taught also the principles of selection, 
as was referred to just above. The average adult house- 
keeper does not have a wide enough variety of foods. 
She is inclined to get into a rut and make the things that 
the family seems to like or what she prefers to prepare, 
without regard to the proper balance. One of the most 
important functions, perhaps the most important function 
of the foods course, is to teach wisdom in the selection of 
foods to be prepared and eaten. (4) How much skill in 
the art of preparing foods should be taught in schools is not 
an easy question to decide. In some communities the 
girls are well taught at home, and in such cases attention 
can best be given to the selection of foods. In other com- 
munities the girls are not taught to cook and prepare menus 
at home, with the result that the school has to pay con- 
siderable attention to this subject if efficiency is to be 
secured. In a sense, the objective of the school is deter- 
mined by the degree of instruction that is given at home. 
In proceeding through the grades, following Bonser and 
Mossman, we find that children in the first grade can be 
taught how foods are put away in the fall. They can be 
given information about the canning of the common foods. 
They can even make some of the jellies, cakes, and soups 
and can learn to wash the school dishes. Some attention 
can also be paid to the sources from which foods come. 
This can be done by visits to the grocery stores, by cut-out 
pictures from food advertisements, etc. In the second 
grade it is possible to continue this work and to make a 
study of how primitive peoples get their foods. In the 
third grade the study of milk seems to be satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-245
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 229 
This includes not only a study of the constituent parts of 
milk but the making of junket, cottage cheese, butter, etc. 
In primitive life work the study of the food of the Indians 
is very interesting. In the fourth grade these authors have 
children study such things as the making of raisins, dates, 
figs. They study nuts, macaroni, eggs, some starches, and 
vegetables. In the fifth grade comes the preparation of 
breads through the use of yeast, etc., as well as some in- 
formation concerning the meats. In the sixth grade the 
planning of meals is made the central topic. In the seventh 
and eighth grades this work may continue, with stress laid 
upon the preparation and selection of foods. 
It is quite apparent from the foregoing statement that 
the selection of what is to be taught is not completely 
settled. Other items might just as well be taken up if we 
are careful to bear three things in mind: (1) The materials 
studied should be those which are actually found in com- 
munity life. (2) The children will eventually have to 
prepare and select foods. (3) The teacher should work 
upon those things upon which he has the most information. 
Summary. In the study of foods it should always be borne in 
mind that the children must eventually prepare foods and in- 
formation should be given to this end about the balancing of diets, 
calories, costs, and selection of food. The amount of skill to be 
taught is dependent upon what is taught in the home and material 
for each grade should be selected upon the basis of community 
needs and the knowledge of the teacher. 
Clothing. In clothing the most important thing to teach 
is discrimination concerning the relative value of the 
factors to be sought for in the purchase and selection of 
clothing. We find that in the selection of clothing there 
are six important factors which need to be borne in mind. 
The first of these is the appearance of clothing. This in- 
volves the texture of the clothing, its quality, its color, and 
its ornamentation. The second value sought for is style.
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
Other things being equal it is better to purchase clothing 
which is in good style rather than clothing which is out of 
style. It is therefore apparent that the study of styles in 
the upper grades is a natural part of the curriculum on 
clothing. A third pair of factors is that of serviceability and 
durability. If the choice is to be made between durable 
clothing and clothing which wears out, it is better usually 
to purchase the durable clothing even if the price is higher; 
serviceability is concerned with the uses to which it can 
be put, whether it can be easily repaired, cleaned, ete. 
The fourth factor is becomingness, and a fifth factor is 
comfort. Specifically, in the selection of shoes, some 
people lay more stress upon comfort, while others consider 
style to be superior to comfort. Finally, in the selection 
of clothing sentiment often plays an important part. 
People are sometimes willing to pay more money for hand- 
made clothes than for machine-made goods which are 
equal in value. 
All of these factors the purchaser of clothing needs to 
take into account, and it is a function of the school to help 
children to be wise selectors of clothing, through a knowl- 
edge of materials so definite that as purchasers they will 
be able to make a wise selection. 
Construction of Clothing. How much the students should 
be taught concerning the construction of clothing is again 
dependent upon what they are taught at home. It has, 
however, been demonstrated that by the time girls have 
finished the eighth grade they are able to attain to con- 
siderable skill in the making of hats and some of the simpler 
garments. There is no reason why all girls should have to 
depend upon milliners for their hats. Many girls have 
much better taste than the average milliner and all that 
they need to make their own hats is to know a few tricks 
in hat-making. If the girl knows these she is able to have 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
SUBJECT-MATTER : 231 
four hats a year where now, because of expense, she may 
have only one. 
The teacher must be careful not to give the girls merely 
some trifling sewing exercises, but tasks about which they 
are actually thinking outside of school. To practice over- 
casting, buttonhole-making and all the other processes in 
class and pay no attention to making hats, dresses, etc., is 
a waste of interest, if not a distinct waste of time. 
Three points are of importance. The first is that there 
should be much home work in the sewing classes; in fact 
the work in school should be in large part a stimulus to the 
sewing work at home. In many country districts great 
interest has been aroused in sewing, even when not taught 
as a part of the regular work; occasionally some time is 
taken for sewing outside of school, and occasionally no 
time is given to it by the teacher except in getting up con- 
tests. The second point is that the boys and girls should 
be made acquainted with the great sewing industries which 
employ hundreds and thousands of men and women, boys 
and girls. Not only should they be introduced to the 
process of sewing or weaving by machines so that they can 
understand how a great plant is organized, but they should 
be taught about the social conditions and the wages of 
these workers. The teacher’s obligation has not ceased 
when she has taught a girl how to make a buttonhole. 
The third point is that boys should learn the elements of 
sewing sufficiently to cover balls, make marble or nut bags, 
sew on buttons, and darn ordinary rents. 
There is no reason why a male teacher should not be able 
to teach sewing to girls. Hundreds of men make their 
livelihood by sewing, but in case the male teacher has not 
learned or is unwilling to learn to teach sewing it is his 
duty as part of his job to see that clothing construction and 
selection is taught by some one who is able to do it properly.
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
Some male teachers derive a good deal of fun from teaching 
the simple sewing in the lower grades and use an experienced 
helper in the upper grades. 
Maintenance and Repair. Quite important in clothing 
is the teaching of darning, mending, cleaning, and the care 
of clothing. Some teachers who do not have the knowledge 
and skill necessary to teach the construction of new gar- 
ments have been of great service to their children in teaching 
them how to perform the operations involved in mainte- 
nance and repair. Skill in darning holes in stockings, or 
rents in clothing, or eliminating spots from clothing is an 
important factor in maintaining a good appearance upon a 
small budget. 
In passing through the grades the work can very well be 
begun with the preparation of doll clothing and proceed 
through a study of the raw materials of cotton goods, linens, 
woolens, and silk to work upon the making of fibers, 
knitting, and weaving. In the study of weaving the 
material is quite extensive because for several years a great 
deal of attention has been paid to this subject in the schools 
and wide studies have been made of primitive weaving. 
In the later grades the study of the textile industries can be 
undertaken to give the children an idea of the great mills 
which provide their clothing materials and the lives of the 
workers who spend their time in providing for their comfort. 
Summary. In all teaching of clothing it is necessary to re- 
member that the most important function of the course is to 
teach the children how to purchase clothing wisely, with due re- 
gard to durability, style, or becomingness. Within limits it is 
possible to teach them how to construct clothing, while to a much 
greater extent it is possible to teach them how to maintain their 
wearing apparel. 
Shelter. There is a wide difference between the course 
that should be given in shelter to the children of the large 
cities and the rural districts. In the former the adults of
-P-A-G-E-249
  SUBJECT-MATTER 233 
the city do very little constructing of buildings, while in 
the latter they do a great deal. Consequently, a part 
of the course in the industrial arts in the city schools lays 
less stress upon skill than it should in rural schools and 
small-town districts. Of the rural districts I wish to speak 
more particularly. Here again, as in clothing and foods, 
the important thing to teach, aside from skill, is the proper 
selection of building materials and the construction of 
out-buildings and possibly barns and houses. The farmer 
and the small-town man have to learn how to plan and 
construct such buildings when it does not pay them to 
employ a carpenter or builder. And even when they 
employ a carpenter they frequently need to give him 
rather definite directions about what they want to build 
and have enough knowledge to supervise his work and see 
that they are getting what they pay for. 
In constructing buildings they need to have a knowledge 
of raw materials. This requires information concerning 
the different kinds of lumber, roofing, cement, stone, brick, 
etc. Of still more importance are the items of maintenance 
and repair. In fact, it is possible to construct a course in 
manual training upon this basis. Fuller, for instance, 
made a careful study of all the repairing that is done by 
men and women around the home, and he finds that the 
most commonly performed repair jobs are the following: 
painting, furniture repair, screen repair, putting handles in 
tools, and sharpening tools. It is quite apparent from this 
that if the teacher will study the community and discover 
what things adults must frequently repair, he can build his 
course upon this information. For while painting is not 
usually included in the ordinary course in manual training 
and carpentry, it is the repair activity most frequently 
carried on and should therefore be taught in the schools of | 
the community.
-P-A-G-E-250
234 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
Girls as well as boys can be taught many of these repair 
operations. There is no reason why they cannot paint as 
well as boys, even though they may not be able to con- 
struct buildings. Moreover, a source of irritation in the 
country home is removed if the wife or daughters do not 
need to depend upon the men of the family for the sharpen- 
ing of knives, the repair of other tools that have to be used 
by women, etc. 
It is quite apparent from the foregoing that the school 
laboratory should contain not merely a few hammers and 
saws, but a great deal of data upon costs and uses of ma- 
terials. This material can be obtained in part from govern- 
ment and state bulletins and in part from figures obtained 
from the local dealers. Merely to teach the boys how to 
make things with the manual training tools is a futile 
method of handling the problem of the use of materials in 
constructing buildings and other permanent farm and home 
equipment. 
In carrying the subject through the grades it is possible 
to begin in the lower grades with the construction of the 
doll house and carry on up through a study of the habita- 
tions of men from primitive times to the present. Attention 
should be paid to the great architectural works of art and 
to the modifications that are made in the construction of 
houses to meet differences in climate. In the seventh and 
eighth grades maintenance and repair can very well be 
made the center of the course and this can be supplemented 
by a study of the construction of different kinds of build- 
ings. In the rural schools relatively less attention will be 
paid to the construction of furniture, but many simple 
conveniences for the home can be made. 
Summary. In teaching the part of the course in industrial arts 
which deals with shelter the central idea is to give the children 
by the end of the eighth grade as much knowledge as possible of  
-P-A-G-E-251
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 235 
the facts, and as much skill as possible in the technique, of con- 
structing, maintaining, and repairing houses, barns, and out- 
buildings. Of these three objectives maintenance and repair are 
of more importance than construction, and in construction skill 
is of less importance than a knowledge of the factors which enter 
into the wise planning of a building and the selection of proper 
materials. 
Projects. Owing to lack of space it is not possible to 
describe the other three centers of interest in industrial arts, 
and for further information upon these the reader is referred. 
to Bonser and Mossman. 
The industrial arts are the home of the project method, 
for here it is possible to secure problems in their natural 
setting and to carry them out in the school under natural 
conditions as they occur at home. A great deal of help is 
available for the rural teacher in the field of industrial arts 
because the Federal government, through the Smith- 
Hughes courses and through the Department of Agriculture 
has been working upon these problems for many years. 
In every State in the Union there are county agents, both 
men and women, who organize the children of the school 
and the adults of the community into clubs and community 
undertakings of the most practical sort. Moreover, vol- 
uminous printed material is available for the use of every 
country school teacher and can be obtained through the 
county agent, the county superintendent of schools, the 
nearest normal school and state university, or from the state 
department of public instruction. The difficulty of the 
teacher in this field is not so much to find material as it is 
to select the proper projects. 
If, however, there is a county agent in the county in 
which the school is situated, it is the duty of the teacher to 
codperate fully with him in his projects and in return to 
secure from him all the assistance that he is able to give. 
It is the duty of the teacher to do this because his main
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
business in teaching school is to fit his children to become 
efficient citizens in the community, and for this there is no 
better method than to codperate closely with the county 
agent in his work. Unfortunately in some schools the 
teacher lacks the spirit of codperation or fails to understand 
the significance of his contribution to the work. In other 
cases the county agent has so small a conception of the 
uses he can make of the school in his work, that the school 
work and the community projects are run independently of 
each other. This is unfortunate but can be easily remedied 
if the county agent and the teacher have the proper codp- 
erative attitude toward each other. | 
2. Interest 
The problem of getting interest in the industrial arts in 
the lower grades is a very simple one to solve. The children 
like to work with their hands. The interest is immediate, 
so consequently the chief business of the teacher is to keep 
them interested by having them work upon interesting and 
useful material and by introducing basic and theoretical 
knowledge only where its value can be seen by the pupil. 
This interest may be heightened by the use of projects 
and problems, for the children are not merely told to do 
things but are given an opportunity to see how they should 
be performed. 
The Personality of the Teacher. In developing interest in 
the work in industrial arts as in all other subjects no element 
is of more importance than the personality of the teacher. 
Conspicuous among the traits which he needs to develop is 
an enthusiasm for the work. If the teacher is himself in- 
terested in it and endeavors to bring out all the interesting 
points upon which he can lay his hands, the enthusiasm 
becomes infectious. This leads us to the second and third 
trait. The teacher must combine with enthusiasm the
-P-A-G-E-253
INTEREST 237 
ability to lead children to study enthusiastically. He must 
have an enthusiastic attitude when he teaches and he must 
be able to show the children the value of what they are 
doing. He must also have considerable resourcefulness in 
meeting new situations. The course is relatively unor- 
ganized at present and he must therefore think up for 
himself ways of making the work attractive. This re- 
sourcefulness is partly based upon knowledge of what to 
do and this can be obtained by reading widely in the 
materials of the industrial arts. To aid him in doing this 
a wide variety of material is available and he should hold 
it to be part of his duty to spend some of his own money 
if he cannot obtain money from his school trustees for 
securing the proper material for the school laboratory. 
Fortunately, much of the material can be obtained at 
small cost in the Federal government bulletins. 
Illustrative Handwork. It is possible to get the children 
interested in the industrial arts by using them as a means 
of illustrating work done in other subjects. Scissors may 
be used on old magazines to cut out familiar words, sand- 
table construction may be utilized to represent scenes and 
events. Clay modeling can be used with excellent results 
in illustrating stories. Miss Dobbs has very well illustrated 
many uses to which handwork may be put. Running 
through her material we find a sand-table reproduction of 
gold mining in California, of Robinson Crusoe, of primitive 
homes in the Philippines, and of a cliff dweller. Following 
this there are many illustrations of the use of posters to 
supplement the study of the Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the 
Beanstalk, Cuba, events in history, views of a Norman 
Castle, the story of Daniel Boone, the evolution of travel 
by land, and statistical posters in geography. 
The number of uses of handwork as an illustrative 
medium is so enormous that selection is difficult to make.

chapter. 
3. Methods of Teaching 
Busy-Work. We can, perhaps, best describe the methods 
of teaching the industrial arts by contrasting the proper 
method with the term “busy-work.” In every rural 
school the problem of keeping the children busy at their 
seats while the other classes are reciting is difficult from 
the point of view of discipline. Consequently teachers 
quickly seize upon any sort of work which will take time to 
perform, and in such work those tasks which involve the 
use of the hands are most time-consuming. As a result 
of this attitude we have what is known as “‘busy-work,” 
where by the term we mean work which is invented pri- 
marily for the purpose of keeping the children occupied. 
This is not the right attitude to adopt in approaching the 
industrial arts. It is essentially mechanical. It is arti- 
ficial because the industrial arts were not developed to keep 
people busy. They have evolved because they are useful 
and the teacher must always bear this in mind in teaching 
the subject, for while it is true that handwork does keep 
the children busy the motive for teaching it is educative and 
not mechanical. 
The Problem Method. Here the work which the children 
do should be done only to solve problems. In using the 
doll house in the primary grades as a center of industrial 
work the object is not to tell them to make things, but to 
use the doll house as a problem, which involves a great deal 
of thought. In building the house they study the con- 
struction of the house, its rooms, doors, windows, stair- 
ways, etc., all in relation to the central problem. Then 
when the house has been planned the problems of how to 
build it arise, and in the solution of these the children par- 
ticipate by discussion. When they have, with the teacher’s
-P-A-G-E-255
METHODS OF TEACHING 239 
aid, found ways of solving their problems they proceed in 
class and at their seats to carry out solutions through the 
medium of cardboard, and the other materials used. By 
this means they not only use their hands but they use their 
minds as well, with the result that their interest is main- 
tained, their ability to think is developed, and their knowl- 
edge of the usefulness of what they are doing is deepened 
and broadened. 
The steps involved in the solution of the problem are 
important. In the first place it is very important that the 
children see the setting of the problem and get it clearly 
defined. For instance, in the building of a hen-house they 
need to know the purpose and use of the hen-house and to 
determine exactly what sort of hen-house they will build. 
Then when they have done this they think over and collect 
suggestions about how to build it, and when they have 
collected all these suggestions they select one of them and 
proceed to build. When it is finished they look it over to 
see whether or not they have built it so properly as to 
perform the purpose which they set up at the beginning. 
Dewey has defined these five steps as follows: (1) There 
is a felt need. This means that the child realizes that 
there is a need for doing something. (2) This need is 
defined in such a manner that he knows exactly what is 
needed. (3) He collects suggestions about the different 
methods of meeting this need or of solving the problem. 
(4) He elaborates these suggestions or thinks them over to 
see which will work and which will not, and tries out the 
one that he thinks will work. (5) He verifies this after he 
has completed it by seeing whether or not it is what is 
needed to meet the needs with which he started out. 
The teacher who tells the child exactly what to do does 
not give him an opportunity to reason. The child does not 
define his problem nor does he have an opportunity to  
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
think about how to solve it; he is merely told to do some- 
thing. By such a mechanical method he becomes a follower 
and not a leader. He is not trained to think for himself and 
so has to depend upon somebody else for directions. 
Such a process of reasoning involves a great deal of time 
and it is much easier for the teacher to tell the child exactly 
what to do, while the work can be turned out much more 
rapidly. But in teaching we are concerned both with the 
product that is turned out and with the child who produces 
it. So, often, when it seems that the work is moving slowly 
because the children are doing it, time is really saved 
because of the fact that by doing it they are getting a better 
education than if they merely followed orders. 
Summary. All hand and head work connected with the indus- 
trial arts should be taught by the problem method. It should not 
be given merely to provide busy-work. In using the problem 
method we must see that the children get a chance to define their 
problems and think and plan methods of solving them as well as 
to carry on the necessary handwork. 
Projects. The problem method by which children reason 
things out for themselves is the center of the project. 
Those problems which the child meets outside of school in 
their natural setting are projects. That is to say, the 
project is merely one kind of problem and therefore the 
problem method is used in projects. 
As has been said in the preceding section, a great deal of 
help is given the teacher in the field of the industrial arts 
in rural schools because of the activities of the Federal 
government. But the teacher may organize projects other 
than those used by the Federal agents. What the projects 
are depends upon the community, but the method of selec- 
tion is simple. The teacher selects valuable projects which 
ean be handled in school and builds his instruction upon 
the basis of these.
-P-A-G-E-257
  METHODS OF TEACHING 241 
Tests. No simple tests of a practical sort have been 
worked out, as in many of the other subjects, partly be- 
cause the curriculum has not been standardized in this 
field and partly because the technique of testing is quite 
difficult. 
Alternation. Sewing is an upper-grade subject because 
the needle is too fine an instrument for the primary children. 
Woodwork and cooking are likewise advanced subjects, 
depending upon age rather than grade. The hammer and 
saw in building construction can be used to advantage in 
the seventh and eighth grades. In all of these subjects the 
seventh- and eighth-grade children can work together upon 
a two-year program. The present seventh grade can 
work with the eighth grade, which has already had the 
first half of the program and the next year the seventh 
grade, which will then have become the eighth grade can 
cover the first half of the work which they missed as a 
seventh grade. In the lower grades the first-grade children 
will probably have to work by themselves because of their 
very great immaturity, but the work of the second and 
third grades can be alternated, while probably the work of 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades can be based by alterna- 
tion upon a three-year program. In case it is found that 
the first- and second-grade work can alternate upon a two- 
year program, then the third and fourth, and fifth and ' 
sixth, can alternate upon a two-year program. 
Summary. In conclusion it may be said that in the work of 
industrial arts the chief problem is the securing of the proper 
materials for carrying on the work, and this problem is made 
more difficult because teachers have not been adequately pre- 
pared in the subject.- But the resourceful teacher can pick up 
a great deal for himself. The problem of interest is not a diffi- 
cult one because’the industrial arts lie so close to the natural im- 
pulses of the children. In presenting the material the teacher 
must be careful to make it constructive by utilizing the problem 
idea, and must avoid with great care the natural tendency to do
-P-A-G-E-258
  22 THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
all the work himself and allow the pupils to follow directions. 
Finally, the teacher should use every possible opportunity to tie 
up the work of the school with the governmental agencies which 
may be operating in the community.

CHAPTER IX 
GEOGRAPHY 
, 1. Subject-Matter 
Function. Geography is the subject in which we study our 
relationship to what is known as our physical environ- 
ment. Originally geography dealt entirely with place. In 
its simplest form geography is concerned with place. 
Broadly speaking, it tells us where things are. In its later 
form it tells us why things are as they are in terms of phys- 
ical environment, such as topography, climate, etc. A 
few illustrations will make these ideas clear. Man has 
always had certain things that he considered to be of value 
and their location of use to him. There is a kind of geog- 
raphy of the house, for instance. We may imagine that 
the housewife is interested in the ice-box, some old pictures, 
a needle, and the broom. In such a case it is very im- 
portant to her to know where these things are, that the 
ice-box is in the basement, the old pictures in the attic, the 
needle in the sewing-room, and the broom in the kitchen. 
A knowledge of place helps her to get control of, or handle, 
these things effectively. Outside of the house it is of 
interest for the husband to know that he can get better 
merchandise in New York, that he can find a book in the 
public library, or that a customer lives at the corner of 
Forbes and Murray. In short, the place idea is connected 
with everything that we do and it is necessary for us to 
have some idea of location if we are to be effective in our 
work. This is quite clearly brought out in ancient geog- 
raphy in which we find, for instance, that a great deal of
-P-A-G-E-261
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 245 
attention is paid to religious geography, or the location of 
religious objects. We see at once in such geography that 
because the people of those days traveled mostly on re- 
ligious errands it was necessary for them to have a knowl- 
edge of places where they would naturally go upon such 
journeys. 
However, as people studied the earth more carefully they 
soon began. to learn that physical environment had a very 
great effect upon the things which men wished to do. They 
found, for instance, not only that wheat grew well in the 
North Central states, and that it did not grow in the 
Amazon Valley, which were matters of place alone, but 
that there were certain reasons for wheat growing in one 
place and not growing well in the other. As they studied 
into the reasons they found that climate had a great effect 
upon the wheat. They discovered also that the nature of 
the soil and the topography of the country had to be taken 
into account. 
So geography has come to include more than location and 
endeavors now to discover the reasons in terms of the 
physical environment. Consequently in the study of 
geography the teacher has two types of things to do. He 
must teach the location of important places and he must 
give the reasons for differences which are due to the physical 
environment. The first of these is known as place geog- 
raphy and the second is sometimes described as rational 
geography. In place geography are taught the continents, 
oceans, important rivers, mountains, cities, and countries 
of the world. In rational geography is explained why New 
York City is larger than Kalamazoo, Michigan, why rice 
can be grown in China, oranges in Florida, and cotton in 
Texas. 
Place geography gives us some control of values, but 
rational geography increases this control. Placegeography
-P-A-G-E-262
    246 GEOGRAPHY 
states that tea grows in China, but rational geography 
describes the conditions of climate and surface which pre- 
vail in China where tea is grown, and when these are known 
it becomes possible for the Agriculture Department at 
Washington to seek for a place in the United States with 
the same physical conditions and to expect that if these can 
be found, tea can be grown there equally well. Asa matter 
of fact, the Department of Agriculture has scouts all over 
the world studying the conditions under which plants are 
grown, with a view to introducing into the United States 
those plants which have been grown successfully under 
conditions similar to those which prevail in different regions 
of our nation. 
Summary. The function of place geography is to tell us where 
we can find things in which we are interested, and the function of 
rational geography is to explain in terms of climate and physiog- 
raphy why we find them in those places. 
Structure. The content of geography may be discovered 
by an analysis of values and of places. If we analyze values 
we find a large variety of things in which people are in- 
terested. There are, for instance, the industries. These 
are in part controlled by the facts of geography. For 
instance, climate has much to do with the industry of agri- 
culture and physiography has a great influence upon manu- 
facturing, because much of its success depends upon 
distance from markets, from the source of raw material, 
etc. Then there are political values, which may be con- 
trolled by climate and physiography. Particularly strong 
is the influence of physiography upon politics, for national 
boundaries are often determined by mountain ranges, 
oceans, etc. We have the biological values, also; for 
instance, a very interesting field of investigation is that 
which devotes itself to discovering to what extent the 
nature of plants and animals is dependent upon character 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
    
SUBJECT-MATTER 247 
and physiography. To these may be added a great number 
of values which geography helps us to understand and 
control. 
When we analyze the place idea we discover two main 
divisions — climate and physiography. These two great 
divisions are subdivided — climate is composed of the 
three ingredients of temperature, moisture, and winds, 
while physiography is variously divided into oceans, rock 
formations, erosions, soils, and other factors which may be 
found in physical geography textbooks. 
We get, then, our organization of geography first by 
classifying values, or things of interest, and second by 
showing what effect the different physiographical and 
climatic elements have upon these. 
What is known as physical geography is what is called 
the place element, i.e., the element of climate and physi- 
ography. To study geography, however, we have to relate 
this physical geography to things of value, such as plants, 
animals, industries, etc., to show where they are and why 
they are there. The basic reason for the study of the 
surface of the earth, capes, bays, rivers, mountains, etc., 
is to prepare the pupils to use their knowledge in under- 
standing the things which they think, from time to time, 
are worth while. 
Summary. Geography is organized on the one side by classify- 
ing values and on the other by analyzing physical geography into 
its elements. These are brought together by showing how the 
values are related to climate and physiography. 
Ideals. In the study of geography four ideals are of im- 
portance. First may be mentioned the ideal of developing 
a good memory. If geography is to be of permanent value 
it is essential that the student should have a permanent 
body of geographical facts. He cannot always be running to 
a book to find out where important places are and if he does 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 GEOGRAPHY 
not remember his ideas are hazy and his actions ineffective. 
The second ideal is that of good judgment. This is par- 
ticularly useful in helping him to claim an intelligent under- 
standing of the influence of geographical conditions. Third, 
we should seek to develop a keen and discriminating visual 
tmagination. He will be greatly helped in his geography 
work if he realizes that geography is not so much a collection 
of names as it is a collection of pictures of the world. He 
should be able to visualize mountains, capes, cities, and 
continents. Fourth, broad-mindedness is of importance as. 
an ideal because it helps him to have a sympathetic under- 
standing of the nations of the world. Geography will teach 
him that where nations are different there are physio- 
graphical differences which are the causes in many cases. 
He will realize that when people of other parts of the world 
differ from him it is not necessarily because they are in- 
- ferior. Probably under the same conditions he would 
himself not be greatly different from them. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. In teaching geography the 
teacher has three chief objectives. The first of these is to 
so teach the child that he will have a love for geography. 
The second objective is the memorization of important 
places. This is particularly significant at the present time 
because the emphasis upon rational geography has been 
accompanied by a corresponding lack of emphasis upon 
the use of the memory. It is absolutely essential that the 
child should memorize the important facts of place geog- 
raphy so thoroughly and automatically that he will never 
forget them. Care should be taken of course in deciding 
what should be memorized, but once these things have been 
decided upon drill should be carried on to the point where 
lists are memorized automatically. The third objective 
of the teacher is to give an understanding of the effect of 
geography upon places, industries, commerce, etc. When 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  SUBJECT-MATTER 249 
the children have finished the course they should have some 
intelligent understanding of the influence of geography 
upon the major activities of society. 
Course of Study. From the foregoing facts these two 
things are evident. First, much of the material found in 
school geographies is not geography at all. Descriptions 
of governments, customs, races, arid industries do not 
belong-to geography as here defined because they are not 
studied in relation to climate and physiography. 
However, since this information is interesting and valu- 
able it might as well be taught in geography as elsewhere. 
The customs of the Chinese are of importance to us and 
since we have no subject called anthropology in school 
wherein these facts may be studied, geography is as good a 
heading to teach them under as any others. However, as 
Hall says, “Through it the American who leaves school at 
the sixth grade gets his first and almost only peep at the 
wide world in which he lives. It is his elementalized 
university course, in which all is reduced to the lowest and 
simplest terms. It is introductory to almost everything 
else, or can be made so.” 
The second fact is that to make up a course of study one 
must select, since there is by far too much material to 
teach. To select_one has first to decide upon the most 
important things to teach. In planning a course of study 
one has to arrange this material according to the needs and. 
interests of the pupils from day to day and from grade to 
grade. When one has selected the most important material 
and has arranged it according to the stage of development 
of the children, he has prepared his course of study. 
Textbook makers and authors have already done this. 
How well it has been done is not so certain, since we do not 
have a unanimous opinion as to the most important topics 
to teach, nor anything like a unanimous opinion about the
-P-A-G-E-266
  250 GEOGRAPHY 
order and arrangement of the subject-matter according to 
the nature of the pupil. For instance, in one geography 
twenty-five pages are devoted to Africa and twenty-six to 
South America, yet the commerce with, and the general 
news from, South America is twice as great as that from 
Africa. Canada in the same text has thirteen pages de- 
voted to it, but the commerce of Canada is more than that 
of South America and Africa combined. « 
Questions of place and a thousand other criticisms arise 
in connection with geography texts and material. But 
this fact cannot be gainsaid — that the American geog- 
raphy, with whatever faults it has, is the finest and best 
illustrated geography textbook in the world. It is suffi- 
ciently good for the teacher to follow whatever text he may 
use with as much closeness as he follows any textbook, 
remembering that he has to deviate here and there when in 
his judgment the needs of his pupils seem to call for a 
departure from the book. 
Summary. The course of study is made up by picking out the 
important facts in geography and arranging them by grades to 
suit the interests and needs of the children. In this there is a great 
difference of opinion, but the teacher without a large amount of 
geography training should follow fairly closely whatever text may 
have been adopted for his school. 
Supplementary Material. One of the chief difficulties of 
the geography textbook is too great compactness. Due to 
the limitations of price, geography textbooks contain the 
information so compactly that children do not get clear 
pictures of what is being taught to them. Consequently 
it is necessary to supplement geography textbooks by a 
wide variety of reading. This material is partly found in 
what are known as geography readers, but is chiefly gained 
from other sources. The newspapers and magazines can 
be gleaned for stories about other countries. Illustrated 
magazines are particularly satisfactory for this purpose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
_SUBJECT-MATTER 251 
Geography scrapbooks are made by teachers to be studied 
by the pupils at their seats. Frequently the children them- 
selves collect this material for the teacher. Stereopticon 
photographs are used to good advantage. 
The sources of the material are numerous and the teacher 
must have a clear realization of the fact that the geography 
textbook must be supplemented from other sources that 
are at his command. 
Home Geography. Home geography is the only sort of 
geography that people have who do not read books or 
travel, but so far as making a living is concerned it is not 
absolutely essential that any one know any geography 
outside of that which he wishes to use. If, however, he 
reads the papers or travels it is almost necessary for him to 
have his geography very considerably enlarged. 
One does not need a book or a school to teach him his 
home geography because he can pick it up for himself as he 
needs it. For this reason, when home geography is taught 
in school it has two purposes. It is intended principally to 
get the pupil ready for world geography. This it does by 
teaching children the meaning of geographical terms and 
definitions by illustrations taken from their own com- 
munity. Then when these terms are thus made clear they 
can be used in world geography. For instance, children 
will have to use terms like “river bed,” “delta,” “canyon,” 
and so on, and these will mean little unless illustrated in the 
topography surrounding the school. If children are taught 
what a river basin is in connection with the local creek, an 
island in the same creek, or a delta at its mouth, they would. 
understand these terms when they met them in world 
geography, but they cannot understand them clearly with- 
out this foundation. It is also of use in bringing into the 
classroom materials and processes which are part of the 
ordinary environment of the child. If, later on, in rational 
bh
-P-A-G-E-268
  
252 GEOGRAPHY 
geography, the sources of the raw materials for food, 
clothing, and shelter are to be taken up and explained in 
terms of climate and topography, it is important that the 
children study these in the classroom as examples of things 
that are of interest in the local community. Then later, 
when the student takes up the study of distant parts of the 
world where these things come from he will have a knowl- 
edge of the articles which are to be studied. 
Home geography therefore involves among other things 
a good deal of excursion work. This means that the teacher 
will take the pupils, as a part of the school procedure, out 
into the community around the school to study the topog- 
raphy of the country. Objections are frequently raised to 
these excursions on the part of the parents at first, but 
when it becomes a recognized part of school procedure these 
objections disappear. In taking such trips the teacher 
must prepare for the trip as carefully as he prepares for any 
other lesson. He must know exactly what he is going to 
see, the children must be in the student attitude and be 
prepared to take notes and get educational training out of 
the excursion. In brief, the teacher merely shifts the place 
where the class is taught from the classroom to the part of 
the community where they can see what is to be taught. 
McMurry says there are seven principal topics which 
should be studied in home geography. These are: (1) food 
products and the occupations related to them; (2) building 
materials and the related trades; (3) clothing, the materials 
used, and the process of its manufacture; (4) local com- 
merce, including roads, bridges, and railroads; (5) local 
surface features inclucing streams, hills, woods, etc.; (6) 
town and city goverument, including the courthouse, the 
city hall, the citv council, ete.; (7) climate and seasons, in- 
cluding the sun, winds, storms, and heat. 
It is not difficult to organize this work. One can begin 
4
-P-A-G-E-269
SUBJECT-MATTER 253 
almost anywhere and take up material in almost any order. 
The order, however, depends largely upon what text is 
used and upon what seems to be the next thing to take up. 
The children not having gone far enough into geography, 
there is no necessity for a logical arrangement; a psycho- 
logical organization is better. When the terms and ideas 
of geography are studied in this irregular order, one thing 
alone is needful. They must be made to stick reasonably 
well in the minds of the pupils in order to form a working 
vocabulary. 
Summary. The function of home geography in the schools is 
to give the pupils a working vocabulary and a working knowledge 
in preparation for world geography. 
Standard Tests. Some few standard tests have been 
made. Notable among these is the Hahn-Lackey geog- 
raphy scale which includes about an equal number of 
memory and thought questions. However, the standard 
tests in geography have not been developed as fully as in 
some other subjects and are still in the experimental stage. 
Home-Made Tests. There are five types of questions 
which are useful in testing and these can be introduced as 
variations from the usual geography examination. Quoting 
from Branom, these are as follows: (1) Informational — 
(in map geography this can be varied by giving the students 
outline maps and asking them to look places up on the 
maps) — “Where is New York City?” “Where is Poland?” 
(2) Interpretive — “Why is there a semi-arid region east 
of the Rocky Mountains?” “Why is the Amazon basin 
sparsely populated?” (3) Statements to be filled in— 
“The two chief rivers of Italy are the ..... and the 
Pst ” (4) Statements to be answered “yes” if entirely 
correct and “no” if partly wrong — “Chicago, located 
near the south end of Lake Michigan, is the largest city in 
the United States.” “The United States imports large
-P-A-G-E-270
    254 GEOGRAPHY 
quantities of raw sugar.” (5) A meaningful statement to 
be made for a word or expression given — “Vesuvius... 
Vienna... rubber...” (Such a statement might be: 
“Rubber is imported from the Philippines.”) (6) Varying 
degrees of definiteness — “Tell why New York City has 
grown so rapidly.” (The pupil is left to make a brief or 
elaborate statement, as he desires.) “Name five reasons 
why New York City has grown so rapidly.” (The pupil 
is here definitely limited.) “Name all the reasons you can 
think of why New York City has grown so rapidly.” (An 
attempt is here made to get the pupil to exhaust his in- 
formation relative to the question.) (7) Questions asked 
by pupils — The pupils are asked to make a list of infor- 
mational and interpretive questions bearing upon such a 
country as Japan. 
Particular attention is called to the type of test made 
by Branom and Reavis, which applies to any country. It 
is too long to quote but will be found in the reference cited 
at the end of the chapter. 
2. Interest 
The specific appeal in geography may come from two 
sources — from an immediate interest in geography or from 
the selection of highly interesting values. The former re- 
quires no discussion, because if it is there, we have nothing 
further to do about it. But if not, then the method of 
getting interest in geography is to connect it with values 
which have to be placed and explained. 
These values are of three or four sorts. First of all, 
there is the appeal to the romantic element in pupils, which 
no other subject can satisfy so well. The arctic circle, from 
which come back tales of heroism and adventure, upon 
maps on which the little stars mark the northward advance 
of discoverers, is filled with a romance that feeds fat the
-P-A-G-E-271
INTEREST 255: 
jdealism of childhood. At the time when this is studied, 
columns of supplementary and library reading should be 
fed them as fast as they can masticate it. The bizarre 
effects of foreign dress and costumes, the beauty of moun- 
tain scenery, the breath-catching jeopardy of glacial cre- 
vasses, the luxuriance of the tropics and the date palms of 
the desert awaken such longings and psychic reverberations 
in the growing boy as will perhaps never be awakened by 
any other means or at any other time. It is this romantic 
love for adventure that makes travel interesting to so many 
people and sends hardy souls into unexplored dangers. 
Geographical readers, simple books of travel and discovery 
are indispensable. 
A good course of geography in the fifth grade can be 
taught through books of travel if, as the pupils read them, 
they study the map with the guidance and patience of the 
teacher to aid and steady them. The course will lack 
system, to be sure; but geography, at best, cannot be very 
systematic, and there is less necessity for system in geog- 
raphy in the fifth grade than in many other places. 
This interest takes on other attractive forms, such as 
that of taking imaginary trips during imaginary vacations. 
Classes have worked up a very considerable enthusiasm 
for a number of things, such as time-tables, railway fares, 
cities, kinds of cattle, climate, etc., by taking an imaginary 
trip in the winter to Texas to buy cattle. So, also, a trip 
of like reality can with profit be made to Colorado or 
British Columbia, for which many dozens of pictures 
showing the grandeur and sublimity of the Rockies have 
been collected by a class. 
In like manner, interest may be stimulated by having a 
class correspond with a class of equal age in a far distant 
locality amid different scenery. Here, again, romance taps 
reservoirs of interest, as is shown by the flood of pictures
-P-A-G-E-272
256 GEOGRAPHY 
and descriptions that pass back and forth between such 
groups. 
In addition to the appeal to romance, there is a practical 
appeal. That is, pupils need the geography in other ma- 
terial activities which they are carrying on. For instance, 
in stamp collecting, a boy is led far afield as soon as he 
begins to gather the stamps of any foreign country. Nor 
can the collector hope to carry on his work intelligently 
without getting a fairly good hold upon the location of 
countries. 
As in history, school work can be carried on so that 
children have to study geography in order to understand 
what they read. One may study the Civil War in many 
ways; but if the student tries to see why the campaigns 
were planned and waged as they were, he must fall back 
upon his geography. He will find that facts of geography, 
and not morals, made the Southern States slaveholders, 
and the Northern States abolitionists; that geographical 
conditions, not nerves, gave birth to the Populists. Geog- 
raphy explains the particular routes that westward immi- 
gration took. Climate makes the South different from 
the North to this day, in temperament, habits, and in- 
dustries; and geography explains how. So not only may 
the teacher so teach history that geography may be learned; 
but unless history is taught through geography, it will not 
be learned as it ought to be. 
Besides the appeal to romance and to the practical 
problems in the lives of the pupils, an appeal can always 
be made to curiosity about common and important in- 
dustries and products. For instance, the history of com- 
mercial products is a matter of interest to children. One 
teacher saw a load of hides hauled across the city, and 
made that rather pane sight the beginning of a series of 
geography lessons. 
  |  
-P-A-G-E-273
INTEREST 257 
She inaugurated the series by the question, “Where do 
those hides come from?” The answer led to the station, 
to the stockyards at Kansas City, and from there to Wyo- 
ming. Before they were through, they knew where the 
grazing lands were, why they were grazing lands, how the 
cattle were raised and cared for by ranchers and cowboys, 
how rounded up and shipped, and how slaughtered and 
finally disposed of. This load of hides was carried on to 
the shoe shop and was not left until the resulting shoes were 
on the feet of some boy or girl. 
Similar series may be introduced by other stimulating 
questions, such as, “‘How do we get raisins?” or, “Where 
is rice produced?” or, “‘Where does silk come from?” Such 
questions are easy to select and not infrequently easy to 
develop into a well-rounded geographical topic. In fact, 
many wholesale houses distribute literature and studies of 
the process of manufacture, for the use of teachers and 
children in school. 
Summary. In getting an interest in geography, appeal may 
be made to romance and adventure, to interest in practical activi- 
ties in which the children are engaged, and to curiosity as to the 
origin and history of common and important articles of commerce. 
Geography is capable of being made a very interesting subject, if 
an alert teacher has charge of the class. 
Correlation. Geography is related to almost every sub- 
ject in the world, for the all-sufficient reason that almost 
everything in the world is more or less dependent upon 
climate or the physical condition of the earth. History we 
have seen to be dependent upon geography, which is called 
“the eye of history.” Botany, likewise, is dependent upon 
climate and soil, since the form of a plant is determined 
very largely by its environment. Modes of dressing, with 
all the industries dependent upon the need for clothing, vary 
with the climate. And architecture, from the igloo of the 
Eskimo to the palm hut of the South Sea Islander, is 
~
-P-A-G-E-274
  258 GEOGRAPHY 
dependent almost entirely upon the physical conditions of 
the locality. 
So geography is easily in place in almost every subject 
of the course of study, and the connections should be made 
wherever and whenever possible. Particularly should it 
be used in connection with language, literature, drawing, 
history, nature study, and agriculture. 
But in another sense many subjects are correlated with 
geography as an aid to it. Arithmetic, for instance, is con- 
stantly needed in geography. So, also, are art and pictures. 
Reading, of course, is needed at every turn. The manual 
arts, particularly painting, sand-table work, and other 
forms of representation, help to illuminate geography and 
make it intelligible. In short, to a very considerable extent 
all subjects are needed to make clear the relation between 
the things we value and the places where we can findthem. 
3. Teaching Geography 
Problems and Projects. The most outstanding difference 
between the teaching of geography a few years ago and at 
present is connected with the development of the problem 
method of attack. Whereas formerly we were concerned 
in teaching with the memorization of facts, the present 
tendency is not only to teach facts thoroughly, but to give 
the children interesting problems to work out in connection 
with these facts. A few illustrations selected at random 
are the following. Instead of merely teaching facts about 
Palestine, the question is raised: “Can Palestine again 
become the land ‘flowing with milk and honey’?” Teach- 
ing the geography of middle Europe, such a question as the 
following can be introduced: “Has Poland a better oppor- 
tunity than Czecho-Slovakia for national development?” 
In teaching the geography of China the question may be 
“
-P-A-G-E-275
  TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 259 
raised: “Account for the dominating influence of the inland 
state of China.” The most suggestive book for teachers in 
handling the project method in geography is that written 
by Smith and cited at the end of the chapter. This con- 
tains three hundred pages of illustrations of how to use the 
problem method. As an illustration of the study of prob- 
lems arising in connection with the study of climate, the 
following are selected from a list of thirty: 
(1) Why is the atmosphere more dense at sea level than at 
high altitudes? (2) Why is a cloudy night in autumn usually 
warmer than a clear night? (3) Why will a sheet of paper over a 
flower bed save it from frost? (4) Why is mercury used in a 
barometer? (5) Why does the mercury rise and fall? (6) Why 
does the mercury in the barometer stand higher at sea level than 
on a mountain side? > * f 
Other types of problems can be selected at random as 
follows: 
Why are so many meat-packing centers in, or near, the Middle 
West? Why is dry-land farming necessary in the High Plains 
section? Why is forest conservation a national necessity? What 
caused the people in New England to settle in small towns while 
in Virginia they scattered over large plantations? What indus- 
tries can one find in the city of Philadelphia? Why do so many 
people live in the North Atlantic states? In what ways is Argen- 
tina a rival of the United States? What are the advantages of 
the position of Buenos Aires? Have the plains of Russia been an 
advantage or a disadvantage to her development? Why is Lisbon 
colder in summer than Pekin? Of what advantage is the Suez 
Canal to the commerce of the world? Why does the finest wool 
in the world come from Australia? What conditions have made 
Italy a great rice-growing country? Why should people make 
their homes in Iceland? 
A glance at these questions shows the tremendous 
amount of interesting material for problems in the study 
of geography. The limitations of the use of the method 
are two. First, the amount of knowledge that the teacher 
possesses, and second, the amount of supplementary read- 
ing material that is available in the school. Yet even where
-P-A-G-E-276
  260 GEOGRAPHY 
the teacher does not have an unusual fund of knowledge he 
can, if he is alert, find in geography many questions for 
which he knows the answer and if he is alert, he will use 
these wherever he can. Moreover, a great many problems 
can be made up from the text, where only one text is avail- 
able. A compilation of lists of problems is perhaps less 
dependent upon the knowledge of the teacher than upon 
his interest in making them up from the material at hand. 
Summary. Ability to answer important and interesting ques- 
tions intelligently in terms of geography is of first importance in 
the teaching of the subject. To this end the teacher should, 
wherever possible, assign problems which involve interpretation 
of geographical facts. These problems are easy to discover by the 
teacher who is interested in finding them. 
Drill. The first thing necessary for the wise use of memo- 
rizing in geography is the determination of the important 
items to memorize. 
4. Methods of Study 
Once the teacher has decided upon the important items 
he should, in my opinion, insist upon their memorization. 
I am sufficiently old fashioned to believe that the important 
capes of North America on the east and west coasts, to- 
gether with the rivers, bays, and islands, should be mem- 
orized until they can be repeated with the glibness of 
“Old Mother Hubbard.” The American boy, in like 
manner, should memorize the rivers of the United States 
in order, the states and their capitals, according to plan. 
In fact, he should memorize everything that is of enough 
importance to justify it. It often stands one in good 
stead to be able to repeat without thinking: “Maine, 
Augusta; New Hampshire, Concord; Vermont, Mont- 
pelier,” etc. In geography, whatever is worth doing, is 
worth doing well; whatever is worth memorizing, is worth
-P-A-G-E-277
  
METHODS OF STUDY 261 
memorizing well; and whatever is going to be used a great 
deal should be set aside for memorizing. 
Textbook Study. Geography is essentially a textbook 
subject and needs to be studied with that in mind. In 
studying about any country, or state, or province, there is 
one thing necessary at the beginning. The teacher must 
decide what are the important things to be studied. For 
instance, in the Tarr and McMurry geography, which 
I have before me, there is given a description of Egypt 
(Book II, Part II, pp. 378-81). In taking up this subject, 
the first thing to do is to decide what topics are worth con- 
sidering. I should say that they are: (1) the Nile, (2) agri- 
culture, (3) history, (4) present status, (5) the Suez Canal, 
(6) the two great cities. Others might not agree with this 
list, but if I were teaching the geography of Egypt, these 
are the points I should feel an American child ought to 
know about Egypt. 
The next thing in preparation for study is to tell the 
pupils what these points are, and have them pay partic- 
ular attention to them. In this lesson, I should set some 
questions about Egypt for them to study: 
. What is the effect of the Nile upon Egypt? 
. What crops are raised in Egypt that might compete with 
American crops? Do they? 
. How is Egypt governed now? 
. Compare the Suez Canal with the Panama Canal. 
. Why is Egypt not now so great as it once was? 
. For what are its two chief cities important? 
. Draw an outline map locating the chief features. N ATED 
Ore 
OO 
we 
Three things should be noted about these questions. 
First, they do not permit parrot answers. They require 
thought. For instance, Number 2 might have been, What 
crops do they raise in Egypt? But by giving it a little 
turn one gets the same items, but from a novel point, 
because Egypt is looked at in relation to American mar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 GEOGRAPHY 
kets. The second point is that, when they are answered, 
the pupil has sifted from the whole lesson those points 
that ought to be memorized. By throwing the information 
into the form of answers to questions a better hold is 
secured than would be if the teacher had said, “Read up 
on the Nile, agriculture, history, present status, and im- 
portant cities of Egypt.” Moreover, when the question is 
thrown into such a form that it will not permit of a merely 
memorized answer, it contains for the student a challenge 
that is decidedly stimulating to thought. 
The third point worthy of note is that these questions 
admit of reference reading in other geographies and geo- 
graphical readers if they are available, as they ought to be. 
For as fast as possible, pupils should be led to read in 
several books and to cull from each anything that will 
answer their problems. 
Summary. In setting assignments in geography, the first thing 
is to decide what are the points that are worth remembering about 
acountry. The second thing is to call attention to these points 
by asking an assignment question about each one, so that when 
the pupil is getting the answer to the question he is learning the 
selected facts. 
Imagination. Geography, history, and literature are sub- 
jects that, of all school subjects, depend to the greatest 
extent upon imagination. For this activity of the mind. 
is the one by which we build up a picture of things that 
are not present to the senses. If the word Egypt brings 
to my mind’s eye a picture of pyramids, sand-swept plains, 
the winding Nile, and the delta at its mouth, it can do so 
only if the imagination helps. In the chapter on spelling 
we mentioned several different types of imagery that are 
at hand for us to use, and showed how in some people 
one type and in other people another type predominates. 
In this chapter, however, we wish to lay stress upon two
-P-A-G-E-279
  METHODS OF STUDY 263 
other factors, which have to do with the process by which 
we call up, or build up, pictures of things. 
The first fact of importance is that every image is the 
product of past experience. When I am asked to imagine 
a rose as large as a cart wheel, I may never have seen that 
sort of rose, but if I have seen a rose and a cart wheel, I 
can then imagine a rose as large as one. But if I have 
never seen a rose or a cart wheel, I cannot get the mental 
picture of a rose as big as a cart wheel. If a fanciful 
novelist draws a picture for us of the inhabitants of the 
moon or of Mars, he picks up a number of characteristics 
with which people are acquainted and puts them together 
in an odd way; but he cannot build up a picture whose 
ingredients are not in past experience. 
This shows us that all world geography is dependent 
upon the past experience of pupils and, particularly, upon 
home geography. For instance, the following sentence 
can be understood and a clear picture formed only when 
the pupils understand the words and terms: “These moun- 
tains form a circle enclosing a broad level area called the 
Hungarian plain, through which the Danube flows.” Un- 
less the children have a mental picture of a circle and level 
plain, they would hardly be able to get any idea of the 
topography of Austria-Hungary. 
These pictures and definitions of terms in geography it 
is the business of the teacher to develop from the practical 
experience of the pupils. If the teacher wished the children 
to build up a picture of the Hungarian plain, and if the 
pupils did not get it by reading, he should refer them to a 
similar location in their neighborhood if such a one could 
be pointed out: a level area surrounded by a circle of hills 
with a stream running through. If such a landscape 
did not exist in the neighborhood, an image of a circle, of 
a level plain, of encircling hills, and of a stream running 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  264 GEOGRAPHY 
through, should be called up one at a time and put together 
upon the request, “Imagine what this looks like: a great 
level plain surrounded by a circle of mountains, with the 
great Danube running through it.” 
In every case the children must start from their own im- 
mediate experience, if they are to get any clear idea of 
what they read. The second important fact to be borne 
in mind in the teaching of geography is that the geography 
pictures, or images, must be made very concrete. What 
I mean may be made clearer by a contrast. 
One may teach the sentence, “The northern and western 
half of the Chinese Empire is a region of plateaus, in some 
places as high as most mountains, and crossed by many 
mountain ranges,” in two ways. It may be hurried over 
and tested by one or more questions that require only 
a memory of the words to answer. The following is such 
a question: “Describe the surface of the northern and 
western parts of the empire.” Obviously, this could be 
answered by the words, “It is a region of high plateaus 
crossed by mountain ranges.” But there is no certainty 
that they have any picture of that portion of the empire. 
It may also be taught more slowly and with assistance, 
so that they can see a high plateau, as high as some moun- 
tains, and crossed by mountain ranges still higher. And 
if this is an important fact, it ought to be taught slowly 
and vividly. 
How to get Concrete Images. A very important question 
follows from the foregoing: How can such vivid pictures 
be built up? To this psychology has one general reply. 
They must be built up out of past experience. And it has, 
also, a number of detailed aids in reorganizing. 
Pictures. One of the greatest aids in teaching geography 
images is pictures. Not everything can be pictured, and 
even when it can be, there is a limit in volume. But as far

as possible, everything described in geography should have 
a picture, if one is obtainable. Geographies by different 
writers should be on the library shelves. Children should 
be encouraged to clip geography pictures from papers and 
magazines at home. School scrapbooks classified by con- 
tinents, and in the case of Europe and North America by 
countries, should be filled and added to from year to year. 
If money is available, stereoscopes which add the third 
dimension of depth should be at the disposal of the pupils. 
These pictures, both in books and out, should be handy, so 
that the pupils may look at them whenever they have spare 
time. : 
Maps. Maps help to make conceptions in world geog- 
raphy clear and definite. Flat maps cannot be accurate, 
because the earth which they represent is round, but they 
are accurate enough for children. They should be used ex- 
tensively, and the pupils should draw maps for themselves. 
Many teachers compel children to spend a world of 
time upon the technical details of maps, and most of this 
time is wasted. Ninety-nine per cent of all maps drawn 
should be sketched. They are not intended to be pretty, 
but to show in an offhand way the shape of the country 
and the physical features concerned. It is better to sketch 
a map ten times in twenty minutes than to spend twenty 
minutes on one copy. The maps should not be slovenly, 
but time should not be wasted over them. A detailed 
and precise map may be allowed once in a while, just as 
a sort of flourish when all the study is over, but the flourish 
should not become a constant habit. The teacher gets a 
much better idea of a pupil’s hold upon map drawing from 
a few of his sketches than from one of his masterpieces. 
Type Studies. A type study is a detailed study of a great 
geographical fact. Such facts are deserts, trade centers, 
river systems, etc. A great saving of time and clearness
-P-A-G-E-282
    266 GEOGRAPHY 
of understanding results from such a study. For if, as 
McMurry shows, a study of the great basin of Utah and 
Nevada as a type of desert is made, the children learn a 
desert very clearly; and when the Sahara Desert, the 
Desert of Gobi, or the Australian Desert is studied, less 
time has to be spent upon each, because the children 
already know pretty well what a desert is. 
In handling type studies, the important points are to 
decide what shall be the type studies for the year in each 
class, and to collect all maps, descriptions, pictures, and 
easy reading material upon these types. One may, how- 
ever, select the types for study after he finds out those upon 
which most material is available. But in each case, every 
effort should be made to make the study as concrete as 
possible. 
This concreteness may be secured at the expense of 
breadth of ground covered; for it pays better to cover 
a little and do it well, than to hurry over it all and make 
none of it clear. I should be better satisfied to leave out 
half the material in a geography text if I were sure that, 
as a result, what was studied was well learned. 
Summary. Concrete ideas of world geography may be built up 
in imagination by careful attention to the content of pupils’ 
minds, by the use of pictures and maps, and by a leisurely pas- 
sage through the subject, taking time enough to have the pupils 
see vividly and understand clearly as they go along. For this 
work, type studies are useful because they enable the teacher to 
go into detail here and there. 
Rational Geography. In studying that kind of geog- 
raphy which seeks to explain why things are where they 
are, we make use of deduction. 
In the chapter on grammar we showed how definitions 
and rules are, or may be, built up by the inductive process 
through an examination of particular cases. The same 
method may be used to build up principles in geography,
-P-A-G-E-283
  METHODS OF STUDY 267 
such as definitions of geographical terms and the estab- 
lishment of geographical principles. The terms, cape, bay, 
island, or desert belong to the first; the relation of climate 
to altitude, to latitude, and to the proximity of large bodies 
of water are examples of the latter. 
However these principles may be learned, they are of 
use as soon as we begin answering the question Why? 
Suppose I ask why Winnipeg is so much colder than Van- 
couver in winter, or Minneapolis than Seattle. We have 
to go back to a number of principles to answer the question. 
One principle would be that the farther from the equator 
one goes, the colder grows the temperature. But since 
Minneapolis and Seattle are on the same parallel, they 
ought by this principle to have the same temperature. 
However, there is another principle to the effect that the 
proximity of a large body of water tends to keep the tem- 
perature higher in winter and lower in summer. This 
principle gives the clue to the answer to the question. 
In all explanation in geography by deduction, there are 
just three factors that enter in: (1) There is a particular 
fact to be explained, or discovered; (2) there are some 
general principles of geography; and (3) these have to be 
brought together by what is called inference. In induction 
there were three steps: the examination of particulars, the 
comparison, and the statement of the generalization. In 
deduction we begin with the generalization. We do not 
need to discover the generalization — we have it; and by 
inference we connect it with particular cases. In the 
illustration just above, we start with a number of general 
principles about climate; and we have, also, the particular 
climates of Minneapolis and Seattle. Our business in de- 
duction here is to find which of our stock of principles of 
climate fit these particular cases. This selection, or finding, 
is called inference. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  268 GEOGRAPHY 
So, also, I may have to hunt for some particular cases 
because they are not given to begin with. For instance, 
I may be an invalid whom the doctor advises to go to a 
region of rare atmosphere and warm days. I do not know 
of such a place, but I know two or three geographical 
principles. These are that rare temperature is found at a 
high altitude, but a high altitude is cold. However, the 
nearer one approaches to the equator, the warmer it is. 
So I set out, in imagination, to find a place in the mountains 
rather far south. I have found the characteristics of this 
place by inference. 
In the upper grades rational geography can be used to 
excellent advantage. The whole tendency in teaching 
geography is to take the material as it is found, but the 
greatest fun comes from setting and solving problems whose 
solutions involve a knowledge of the principles of geog- 
raphy. Textbooks offer work of this kind, but the teacher 
should set as his ideal the asking of such questions wherever 
within the pupils’ powers to answer. 
Summary. Deduction is a process of thinking by which we 
apply rules and principles to the explanation or discovery of 
particular cases in which we are interested. It should be used 
in geography in the form of what is called rational geography 
wherever and whenever the teacher thinks the principles are in 
the possession of the pupils. 
Outlines. It is wise to have an outline with which to 
begin the study of the physiography of a continent. What 
this outline shall be is a matter of your own judgment. 
With this point understood, the following is suggested for 
each continent: 
1. Countries and capitals 6. Islands 
2. Mountains 7. Peninsulas and isthmuses 
8. Rivers 8. Lakes and seas 
4, Gulfs and bays 9. Area (in comparison with 
5. Capes other units)
-P-A-G-E-285
METHODS OF STUDY 269 
In no case should any geographical name be listed under 
these unless it is of prime historical or commercial im- 
portance. Once the lists have been prepared, I am firmly 
of the opinion that each list should be memorized until the 
series has become second nature or, as the psychologist 
would say, until it has become automatic. 
Attention should be called to the outline by Branom 
referred to above, and included in the references at the end 
of the chapter. In this outline, which can be used for any 
country, but which is too long for quotation in full, the 
following are a few of the items: (1) Give the direction of 
this country from your home city. (2) Give in square 
miles the approximate area of the United States, and state 
whether this country is larger, smaller, or approximately 
the same. (3) Indicate an important highland in this 
country. (4) Is the prevailing rainfall heavy (above fifty 
inches), moderate (twenty to fifty inches), light (less than 
twenty inches)? 
The Socialized Recitation. Branom gives a very good 
description of the use of the socialized recitation in geog- 
raphy where the class works either as a unit or where 
certain members of the class work together as a unit. It 
is, of course, customary to let each child study geography 
by himself, but the children can also work together in 
groups if the work is properly handled. The idea is to 
subdivide the work of the class so that certain individuals 
will feel responsible for certain sections of the problem. 
When a problem is set, such as: Account for the importance 
of manufacturing in the New England States — the 
teacher plans the work with the pupils. Leaders may be 
selected or lists or topics may be listed on the board and 
the children allowed to volunteer to take care of one or 
another of them. Then, when the class recitation occurs 
each individual or group will have looked up his own ques- 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 GEOGRAPHY 
tion or group of questions and will be prepared to answer 
it. The advantages of this group work lie chiefly in the 
training that it gives the children in working together. 
In this sense it becomes training in civics as well as geog- 
raphy. ‘The difficulties are not serious; the teacher must 
guard against a few children monopolizing the leadership 
and must be careful to divide and classify things to be 
taught into two divisions — that work which every child 
must learn for himself, and that other material upon which 
a report is sufficient. Therefore, the group work must be 
introduced with great care and must be thoroughly or- 
ganized by the teacher before it is undertaken. While the 
socialized recitation is a very fine method of teaching, it is 
difficult to administer, and the teacher should turn toward 
complete socialization of recitations slowly through the 
use of individual assignments first. From this he can ad- 
vance to the selection of people to work together on prob- 
lems, and then finally to the place where the pupils may 
select their own leaders and handle the problem for them- 
selves through class discussion. Through the socialized 
recitation the teacher can throw the responsibility of study 
upon the children. Yet he himself has to be the center of 
the group while remaining in the background to see that 
the children are working effectively. It is really easier 
for the teacher to use the ordinary class recitation methods 
than to use the socialized recitation, but the advantages 
that are derived from the fact that the children feel that 
they are doing the work themselves are so great that the 
socialized recitation method of conducting classes should 
be used wherever practicable. 
Alternation. It is usually found advisable to teach home 
geography in the third and fourth grades together. After 
this the fifth and sixth grades may alternate, and the 
seventh and eighth grades as well. This is easily possible

in geography, because there is no close logical relationship 
between the series of topics. There is no reason why 
Europe should be studied either before or after Asia, since 
an understanding of one is in no way dependent upon a 
preliminary knowledge of the other.

  CHAPTER X 
HISTORY 
1. Subject-Matter 
Function. The function that history serves is twofold. It 
provides a pleasant occupation for a large number of 
people, who, for a part of their time, or for all of it, study 
it just because they like to know about what happened in 
the past. They are very well described by the poet Southey 
in these words: 
My thoughts are with the Dead; with them 
T live in long past years; 
Their virtues love, their faults condemn, 
Partake their hopes and fears. 
These people study history for its own sake. To them 
it makes no difference whether history has any practical 
use or not. And, of course, if they want to study about 
the past, they have a perfect right to do so. 
History may, however; be studied for its intrinsic value 
by people who are not very much interested in the past. 
These students study history to find methods for solving 
their own problems. For instance, a teacher may not care a 
great deal about the history of George Washington except as 
it helps her to get her children to tell the truth. Willie may 
object to telling the truth because he is afraid of a whipping. 
History will help by saying, “Here is a story of a great man 
who had a chance to tell a lie, and this is what he did.” 
Or, a boy grows discouraged about securing an education. 
History again furnishes an example in the story of the early 
struggles of Abraham Lincoln. Outof school, asinnerisafraid 
that he has “sinned away his day of grace.”” But history 
helps him by furnishing the story of the thief on the cross.
-P-A-G-E-290
274 HISTORY 
The foregoing are moral problems. But history aids 
in handling many other types of situations. Why is the 
South Democratic in politics? What should be our at- 
titude toward the Philippines? Should the Federal 
Government of the United States conserve the forest 
wealth of the nation? History shows causes, precedents, 
results — provides us with data upon which to work in 
answering this question. There is hardly a problem or 
question raised to-day which does not have light thrown 
upon it from a study of history. 
Summary. The function of history is to give us accurate in- 
formation about the past. It helps us to solve our problems by 
telling us how other people have solved these same problems when 
they were confronted with them. We will get the greatest amount 
of value from history when we make it as real and concrete as we 
can, when as nearly as possible we can relive the situations in 
which past peoples met these problems. 
Patriotism. It is sometimes said that history develops 
patriotism. This it does by showing how many men and 
women in the past, when met by great crises, have, in 
attempting to solve the problems that confronted their 
countrymen, given themselves wholly and unselfishly, even 
sometimes at the cost of their lives. The spectacle of men 
so acting comes to the present generation as an answer to 
their questions about sacrificing self to country. Many 
a man when brought face to face with an issue that permits 
of an easy path to self-aggrandizement or a difficult path to 
unselfish devotion to his country, has been influenced by 
the way in which some dead hero acted in a similar situa- 
tion, And all citizens, whether brought actually face to 
face with such a situation or not, when they think what 
they might do if their country should make such a demand 
on them, are influenced to act in imagination in favor of 
their country. Such an attitude we call patriotism. 
Ideals. There are three ideals which should be developed
-P-A-G-E-291
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 25 
in connection with the teaching of history. The first is 
that of broad-mindedness. In studying the problems that 
have confronted the people of the past, particularly the 
people of our own nation, and the controversies between 
our nation and others, the pupils should develop the point 
of view that there are always two sides to every question 
and that the actions of our ancestors were not always ab- 
solutely right while their opponents were absolutely wrong. 
The children in the North in the controversy over States’ 
rights at the time of the Civil War should see that the people 
of the South were not villains and traitors, but that they 
were fighting for what they considered to be the right. 
Also, the children of the South should see that in the same 
controversy the people of the North won not merely be- 
cause they had more money but because there was some- 
thing in their point of view. \'The greatest defect in teaching 
the history of a country is the tendency to develop only 
one side of a question. ‘The second ideal arises from this, 
and may be called a rational love of country. Blind and 
irrational love of country is dangerous. We despise the 
carping critic. When criticism is offered it should be con- 
structive criticism and the whole force of the nation, stimu- 
lated by love of country, should be turned toward the im- 
provement of what we believe to be a wonderful country 
in which to live. The pupil should feel that his country 
tries to do what is right and in the main has succeeded in 
improving conditions and making it a better place in which 
to live. \/The third ideal is that of developing an accurate 
memory for important and significant facts concerning 
the past, and this should be brought clearly to the attention 
of the pupil. He should make it his duty not merely to 
read the history of his country but to remember it so well 
that he can tell its stories with great detail and quote his 
facts with accuracy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 HISTORY 
The Teacher’s Objectives. There are three important 
objectives to be sought by the teacher in teaching history. 
(1) It is the duty of the teacher to see that children love the 
history of the United States. The pupils should approach 
it with pleasure, to the point where they read history for 
recreation. (2) When children have covered the course in 
history they should have memorized in greater or less detail 
the facts about important people, dates, and events. (8) 
In the upper grades and in the lower to as great an extent 
as possible, the teacher should see that the children use 
their reason and judgment. ‘The approach should be 
through the problem method. This means that the children 
should not merely memorize the facts of history; rather 
they should see history as the record of a series of problems 
which confronted people in each age and upon the solution 
of which a reasonable amount of judgment and thought 
were expended. “‘ Christopher Columbus discovered Amer- 
ica in 1492” is a fact, but a problem lies behind it — How 
could the people of Europe in the latter half of the fifteenth 
century bring the luxuries of India to their homes without 
having to pay toll to the Turks? From the point of view 
of the problem we get not only the fact that Columbus 
discovered America but we gather together a number of 
interesting attempts to solve this problem, one of which 
was Columbus’ solution to the problem — that to go to 
the East we should start toward the West. 
The Course of Study. The Committee of Eight published 
in 1909 a widely read report dealing with history in the 
elementary grades. Their outline runs as follows: 
First grade. Indian life. Stories connected with Thanksgiving 
Day and Washington’s Birthday. Stories connected with 
local events. 
Second grade. Indian life. Thanksgiving Day. Washington’s 
Birthday. Local events. Memorial Day.

SUBJECT-MATTER 277 
Third grade. Heroes of other times: Joseph, Moses, David, 
Ulysses, and so on to Columbus. The Indians. Independence 
Day. 
Fourth grade. Historical scenes and persons in American history, 
colonial period. 
Fifth grade. Historical scenes and persons in American history 
continued. Great industries of the present. 
Sixth grade. European background of American history. Selected 
topics from Greek, Roman, and European history to the end of 
Raleigh’s colonial enterprises in America. 
Seventh grade. American history to the close of the Revolution. 
European background continued. 
Eighth grade. American history since the Revolution. Great 
events in European history. 
C. A. McMurry in his Special Method in History works 
out the following courses of study: 
Grade II. Christmas and Thanksgiving celebrations. Wash- 
ington’s Birthday, local history, Indian life and relics, the different 
nationalities in the community, and where they came from. 
Grade IV. Discoveries and explorers: Pioneers of the local 
state, Henry Hudson, the earliest Dutch settlers, Champlain, the 
Five Nations, La Salle; with some optional topics. 
Grade V. European explorers in America, and Western stories; 
European history: Spanish and Portuguese stories, stories of 
England and Scotland. 
Grade VI. European history, including Persian Wars, Darius 
and Xerxes, the battle of Salamis, the Punic Wars, the Scipios; 
Colonial history in America, including Virginia, New York, Penn- 
sylvania, and Massachusetts. 
Grade VII. The Reformation in Germany and Europe, the 
Puritan revolution in England, Louis XIV and the French mon- 
archy; American history, including the period from the beginning 
of the Revolution to the ratification of the Constitution. 
Grade VIII. European history (a few selected topics); Ameri- 
can history from the ratification of the Constitution to the present 
time. 
While the Committee of Eight has presented the material 
in the form which is given above, many experiments are 
being carried on at the present time to discover other 
methods of organizing history. Through all these studies 
an attempt is being made to find out which are the most
-P-A-G-E-294
    278 HISTORY 
important problems of the present day upon which history 
can throw light. It is found, for instance, in the news- 
papers that the greatest amount of space is given to taxa- 
tion, foreign relations, suffrage, monopoly in legislation, 
public service commissions, liquor and prohibition. If we 
use material so derived as a basis for our course of study 
of history in the upper grades and in the high school it is 
apparent that we shall take the problem of taxation, for 
instance, and carry it through from the beginning of 
American history to see how it has been handled by people 
at different periods. 
Some of these studies are very interesting; for instance, 
Horn of the University of Iowa uses the history of med- 
icine or the story of the improvement of health conditions 
and the use of medicines as a basis for one part of the history 
course. He raises such problems as the following: What are 
some of the things that have made us realize the im- 
portance of understanding how our health and the health 
of others may improve? This leads to the study of the 
rejections from the Army and Navy, of the present death- 
rate and loss to production through illness. Then he 
proceeds to consider the lines along which progress has 
been made. The following are a few of the problems set 
for the children. Why is there so much less use of super- 
stitious practices now than formerly in treating illness? 
What improvements have been made in the methods of 
discovering the causes of diseases and the means of cure? 
What are the communicable diseases about which we 
have learned the most? What have we learned about 
them? What improvements have been made in the train- 
ing of physicians and nurses? To what extent is atten- 
tion paid to sanitation, bad health conditions, etc.? 
It must be recognized, of course, that in the last analysis 
inexperienced teachers must depend primarily upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
SUBJECT-MATTER 279 
textbook, but it is very interesting to them to know that 
many people are getting together material which will 
appear in textbooks for their use. Just as in spelling, for 
instance, the investigators have been trying to find exactly 
the right words to teach the children, so in history studies 
are being made to make new textbooks available for the 
use of teachers. 
A word should be said about the place of biography in 
history. In the third, fourth, and fifth grades children are 
interested in little else but biography, but in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades they are old enough to under- 
stand the development of the political organization of their 
nation. The biographical element should never be lost 
sight of in the grades, however. The reason for this lies 
partly in the fact that children like biography, but a more 
important reason is that facts and principles can be carried 
best in stories. Thus any one will recognize that the sermon 
whose points are illustrated with stories is better under- 
stood than one without stories. The Master Teacher’s 
success as a teacher was partly due to the fact that he 
always illustrated his principles with parables. Many 
thousand volumes of the most scholarly kind have been 
written to explain what He meant, but His own simple 
illustrations in four short gospels have made more people 
better understand what He wanted to teach than all these 
thousands of difficult explanations have been able to do. 
So, in history, the facts and lessons contained therein are 
best understood and remain the longest in memory when 
they are associated with the lives that lived them. 
Continuity in History. In any field of history, such as 
American history, the people have had some problems that 
have been with them constantly. For instance, one prob- 
Jem that has confronted the Ameri¢an people is that of 
organizing the separate states with their different interests
-P-A-G-E-296
  280 HISTORY 
and pasts into one united country. In Colonial history we 
study each State to see how each one grew up independent 
from the others, with its own government, laws, and ideals. 
In this period, while they were separate, they attempted 
from time to time to unite, whenever they were confronted 
by big problems, such as opposing the concerted attacks of 
Indians or the encroachment of the French. They met 
from time to time and framed plans of union, such as 
Franklin’s. In the Revolutionary period we see how they 
did get together to withstand England, and how, after the 
war was over, they tried for a number of years to frame a 
constitution that would give the States as much independ- 
ence as they could keep while at the same time forming a 
real union. ‘Then, after the Revolutionary period, we 
find this question coming up again and again. Finally, 
at the time of the Civil War an actual rebellion took place, 
in which some of the States fought to become independent, 
while others fought to keep the Union intact. _ Even to-day, 
the present administration is face to face with the question 
of whether or not the States shall conserve the forests 
and national lands, or whether the National Government 
shall do so; and some writers claim that the differences of 
opinion are serious enough to split the Democratic Party. 
Rational History. This sort of history which seeks to 
show how a continuous problem runs through the subject, 
and endeavors to explain it by cause and effect, is called 
rational history. The other sort of history study may be 
called factual, because all it seeks to do is to teach facts. 
In studying rational history, it is necessary to understand 
not only that certain facts occurred, but just why they 
happened as they did. A factual study of the Civil War 
would deal merely with the facts. It would state that war 
began in such and such a year, that the Federal leaders took 
such and such measures, and that the Confederate generals
-P-A-G-E-297
  SUBJECT-MATTER 281 
did thus and so. If the war were studied rationally there 
would, in addition to this, be an attempt to explain why 
war was declared, what led the Federals to do this, and the 
Confederates to do that. 
The most important question for teachers in all of this 
work is the amount of this reasoning from cause to effect 
that pupils in the grades are able to accomplish. The 
answer, in brief, as I see it, an answer based on empirical 
grounds, is this: Children in the seventh and eighth grades. 
can do a great deal of this reasoning if the teacher will help 
them, but below that grade there is not much use in laying 
stress upon the connection of events in history. 
Rural School History. It is probably not wise for rural 
schools to attempt to teach history to any extent in sepa- 
rate classes before the seventh grade. American history 
studied out of the ordinary text should begin there. 
This does not mean that history will not be taught below 
these grades. One cannot help teaching history to children 
who read widely; for school readers have much historical 
matter in them. Supplementary readers should be partly 
historical. Special occasions, as national holidays, have 
historical settings; and many of the best story-books for 
children are founded upon historical events. 
But in the seventh and eighth grades some attempt 
should be made to systematize American history. This 
will lead back at certain points into English history, but 
no systematic English history should be attempted. 
Summary. The course of study should have a strong bio- 
graphical element. The reading material in all grades should 
and does contain much historical matter. But systematic his- 
tory should, in rural schools, begin not before the seventh grade 
and then consist of American history only. In these grades 
attempts should be made to teach it rationally. 
Standards. When pupils have finished the eighth grade 
how much history should they know? In answering this
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 HISTORY 
question we must define what we mean by the word 
“know.” One may have a great mass of facts and ideals 
which are a part of his make-up, which he cannot organize 
and state, or he may have facts that he remembers defi- 
nitely. Looking at the question from the first standpoint 
I should say that the pupil should read as widely as he 
possibly can — not to remember all but to absorb. On 
the other hand, the actual facts to-be drilled upon need not 
be many. With reference to the question of what dates 
should be memorized, Wooters obtained the following by 
a questionnaire sent to experts in history as the twenty 
most important to learn: 1492, 1607, 1620, 1765, 1775, 
1776, 1781, 1783, 1787, 1789, 1803, 1812, 1820, 1823, 1846, 
1850, 1854, 1861, 1863, 1865. To these may be added other 
dates which would be included in a list of more than twenty 
and brought up to the year 1924. Dates are merely hooks 
upon which facts can be hung, or, viewed in another light, 
they are milestones by which to determine the relative 
location of events. No list of significant facts to be re- 
membered has been compiled. The teacher has to select 
these facts for himself. When he has done this he is able 
to show the children exactly what facts should be known 
so well that they are not likely to be forgotten. 
In history some standard tests have been worked out, 
and these tests are of two sorts — those which test for facts 
and those which test for interpretation. The tests are still 
in the experimental stage, but the teacher can work upon 
home-made tests for himself, using the methods which 
have been described in geography and reading. Among 
the standard tests are such as the following. McCollum 
has prepared a test in United States history in which he 
tests a knowledge of dates, men, events, historical terms, 
political parties, divisions of the United States, and map 
study. Under dates he says: “The following is a list of
-P-A-G-E-299
  
INTEREST 283, 
dates, opposite which you should write some great event 
that happened on that date: 1861, 1789,” etc. Under men, 
he says: “‘(a) This is a list of men. In just a sentence tell 
who each was or what great thing he did: (b) Number the 
men in chronological order: John Burgoyne, Alexander 
Hamilton, Jefferson Davis,” ete. 
Starch uses the completion test as “... discovered 
America in 1492.” “John Cabot exploring for the..... 
in 1497... landedonthe ... coast and claimed the coun- 
tirydori8ii ” “New Hampshire was founded in .... . 
The recognition test is used by Davis as follows: “The 
Mayflower was a hotel, plant, queen, ship.” “Miles 
Standish led in fighting the Dutch, Indians, Puritans, 
Swedes.” 
The foregoing scales or tests deal with facts. The 
Pressey tests in historical judgment seek to test the pupil’s 
ability to read historical material intelligently, to determine 
his knowledge of time-sequence, to estimate the importance 
of events, and to see cause-and-effect relationships. 
The teacher can develop home-made tests by using the 
devices found in these tests and those in other fields. The 
completion test, the recognition test, the true-false test, 
and other devices give variety to testing which is greatly 
appreciated by the children and saves the time of the 
teacher in grading papers. “ 
2. Interest 
Immediate Interest. There is no such thing as imme- 
diate interest in history in the grades. If there were, the 
pupils would read any historical story with interest. There 
are only certain kinds of facts in which they are interested. 
Mediate Interest. Children are fond of adventure, of 
dramatic stories, and of biography with action in it. To 
make history interesting to children, it has to feed these
-P-A-G-E-300
  284 HISTORY 
interests. To make children like history, it has to be the 
kind they like. This is the case of the problem of getting 
interest. 
One thing in which children are interested is special 
days, and these may be made a fine basis for much reading. 
Thanksgiving Day easily becomes the center of extensive 
work in Colonial history. 
Local characters are frequently interesting because they 
are local. Daniel Boone can be made interesting to all 
children, but particularly to the children of Boone and 
Callaway Counties, Missouri, because some of his de- 
scendants live in these counties at this day. Then, too, 
stories of pioneers and the olden days in any locality have 
a fascination for children which will, in the higher grades, 
make them seek interviews and write stories for the rest 
of the class to hear. In fact, so strong is this, that in some 
country schools clever teachers with a love of history have 
organized: little historical societies with the children as 
members, and these have collected relics of bygone days, 
such as books, candlesticks, guns, knives, and so forth, and 
have furnished a small museum in the school or in some 
other public place. But chief of all, the result has been 
that they have thereby developed a love of the past and a 
cherishing regard for the monuments that exist in the com- 
munities in which they live. 
If I were an historian and wanted to write a text on 
American history which would make the children love the 
subject, I should make it one thousand pages long instead 
of three hundred. Instead of packing it with facts, I 
should select just a few great movements and events, and 
I should write all the interesting stories centering about 
them that I could find. Our histories are too small. For 
instance, an elementary history in front of me has three 
hundred and fifty pages. ‘The children spend nine
-P-A-G-E-301
  
  INTEREST 285 
months on this, which is at the rate of two pages a 
day. And all the material on these pages is packed and 
condensed till there is no fun left in it. The teacher who 
uses such a book should see that there are at hand for 
outside reading some other histories and, if possible, his- 
torical novels, which can be understood by the children; 
source books prepared especially for young students; and 
supplementary readers. To make history interesting it 
must not be concentrated history. There must be plenty 
of interesting detail. Condensed history is like hard-tack. 
It is probably nourishing, but very hard to masticate. 
Summary. The secret of getting children interested in history 
is to make it biographical; center it around the interests of the 
children; and, particularly, put in plenty of stories and anecdotes 
that fill it in and give it body without making it more complicated. 
A teacher with a thin history book must supplement the text by 
outside readings of a simple sort. 
Correlation. Any one who has read the foregoing pages 
will see that history is easily correlated with many other 
subjects. These may be summarized briefly. 
History works well with drawing, because the latter can 
be used as an illustrative medium. Many events can be 
portrayed; and a boy ought always, if he has gotten the 
content of what he writes, be allowed some little time for 
embellishment by pictures. 
History and reading are also closely related, because, 
since one needs to read in order to master history, he can 
get practice in reading by reading history. If the basic 
reader in a school does not have plenty of historical material 
in it, a few historical supplementary readers should be pur- 
chased for the children. 
Literature is correlated with history in two ways. 
Poems and speeches can be used to clarify historical events 
and make them interesting. The poetry that was written 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  | 
286 HISTORY 
at the time of the Civil War and just prior to it, makes 
clear the intensity of the feelings during that national 
crisis. History also clarifies poetry. Without the histor- 
ical setting of the “Star-Spangled Banner,” that song loses 
half its value. 
Geography, in particular, is correlated with history. 
Climate and physiography play such a tremendous part in 
all the affairs of men that they must, of course, leave their 
influence in a marked degree upon history. Climate affects 
health and bodily vigor. Climate, together with soil, as we 
said before, made the Southern people slaveholders. The 
mineral production of California made history. Streams 
of water with force and fall turn machinery and determine 
a nation’s characteristics. Waterways facilitate commu- 
nication and promote unity. Mountains affect inter- 
communication and tend to produce isolation. Mountains, 
too, promote freedom and love of independence. 
Military campaigns are based upon geography. Here 
is a pass, there a point that commands highways of com- 
munication. These are strategic points which have to be 
taken, and history is made around them. 
To make some of these connections between history and 
geography is one of the interesting tasks of rational history. 
The geographical explanation of historical facts is fas- 
cinating whenever it is followed with perseverance. 
3. Methods of Study 
Problems. The most important point in teaching sys- 
tematic history in the seventh and eighth grades is that 
each event in history is due to some defect in what has been 
done previously. When this deficiency is felt, a problem 
arises, and some events are carried through by the nation 
to solve this problem. ‘Then, in return, this solution has 
certain results which often in their turn have defects in
-P-A-G-E-303
  METHODS OF STUDY 287 
them and lead to new events which would seek to correct 
these defects. This statement can best be made clear 
by an illustration taken from an elementary school text- 
book in history. On pages 275-277 occur the following 
sections: 
261. The first steam railways. In 1807 Fulton had proved 
that boats could be propelled by steam. Later it was asked 
whether “steam wagons” were possible, for use on land. George 
Stephenson, an English engineer, said that they surely were possi- 
ble, and in 1825 he demonstrated this by opening the first steam 
railway in England. A year later, John Stevens built the first 
steam locomotive in America, and operated it on a little experi- 
mental railway at Hoboken, New Jersey. But for three or four 
years little more was heard of this new invention. 
Between 1828 and 1830 the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, 
which had wooden rails with a flat strip of iron on top, was built 
for a distance of sixty miles out of Baltimore; its destination was 
the Ohio River. At first the cars were drawn by horses, although 
unsuccessful experiments had been made with sails. In August, 
1830, a small engine, called “Tom Thumb,” built by Peter Cooper, 
of New York, made its first trip over thirteen miles of this road. 
The “Tom Thumb” could follow sharp curves and climb steep 
grades, whereas the English railways were quite straight and 
almost level; and it could go much faster than any of the English- 
built engines. It was, therefore, better adapted to the conditions 
that existed in this country. Progress had been slow, but it had 
been sure; and inventors were much encouraged over it. By the 
end of 1831 several American railways, which before this had 
been using horses, were experimenting with steam locomotives. . . . 
262. The crudeness of early railways. In the early years of 
the railways, however, their methods and equipment were very 
crude, compared with what we are used to. For instance, it was 
not at first thought to be possible to cross the Alleghany Moun- 
tains with steam locomotives. For a long time “portage” cars 
were hauled up or let down over the steepest parts by stationary 
engines. This system lasted until about ten years before the 
Civil War. The passenger who in those days wished to go farther 
west than Pittsburg, must, as in the time of the National Road, 
proceed by steamboat down the Ohio River.

    288 HISTORY 
For many years nearly every little stretch of railroad was built 
and owned by a separate company. ‘The rules and gauges — 
that is, the distances between the rails — of these various lines 
often differed greatly from one another, and there had to be fre- 
quent transfers of “through” passengers and freight. But little 
by little the “roads of steel” were combined into the great “‘sys- 
tems” that now cross our entire continent in every direction, and 
Biers what is on the whole the best railroad service in the 
world. 
Turning over to pages 415-420 we find the following: 
369. Development of the country, 1861-1877. In spite of the 
loss and suffering caused by the Civil War, the United States kept 
on growing during the Administrations of Lincoln, Johnson, and 
Grant. Population increased as follows:

There was an increase in wealth, too; and the progress in com- 
munication and inventions improved the opportunity in life for 
every one. In particular (1) a great mineral empire was de- 
veloped in the West; (2) the Union Pacific Railroad was built 
across the Western Plains to the Pacific Ocean; (3) a new generous 
policy was adopted, of giving free farms or homesteads to citizens 
who wanted them; (4) many factories were established, and their 
employees became a new industrial class; (5) there was a new in- 
terest in education; and (6) the United States in 1876 celebrated 
the one hundredth anniversary of independence. Each of these 
requires separate treatment. 
370. The mineral empire. When gold was found in Cali- 
fornia in 1848 (see par. 291), the rush of miners was so great that 
a new State was formed and admitted in a few months. Many 
of the gold-seekers, unsuccessful in California, kept on hoping to 
find wealth somewhere in the mountains; and some of them, in 
1858, discovered it just east of California, in what was Utah 
Territory, and also in Kansas Territory, a little northeast of 
Pike’s Peak. This country, extending from Kansas to California, 
was called the Great American Desert, and was believed to be too 
dry and mountainous for use. The new gold discoveries led to 
the growth of towns and mining camps, and to a demand for more 
Territories. Colorado, Nevada, and Dakota were created by 
Congress in 1861. The finding of gold and silver continued, and 
the area of the “mineral empire” was extended over all the moun- 
tain country. Other new Territories followed: Arizona and
-P-A-G-E-305
METHODS OF STUDY 289 
Idaho (1863), Montana (1864), and Wyoming (1868). During 
the Civil War, and the years after it, the mining camps were 
filled with bustling, speculative life, and the seven young Terri- 
tories advanced toward statehood. Only Nevada (1864), Ne- 
braska (1867), and Colorado (1876) were admitted during this 
period; but all the diggings helped to turn American attention to 
the Far West. 
371. First railroad to the Pacific. The Civil War and the 
mining Territories together made a Pacific Railroad necessary, 
and possible. ‘The former called attention to the great distance 
between the States and California, and the slender physical bond 
that held East and Far West together. There had been an over- 
land stage to California, and the pony express; but now the people 
demanded a railroad, with its quicker service. The mining camps 
made this demand more imperative.. Their inhabitants wanted 
mails and protection: Congress made the building of such a 
railroad possible by giving land and lending money to the Union 
Pacific and Central Pacific Railroad Companies. It gave them 
ten sections from the public domain for every mile of track they 
built, and lent them sixteen thousand dollars worth of Govern- 
ment bonds per mile. 
The new transcontinental railroad followed closely the line of 
the old wagon-road from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Sacramento, 
California. It was finished in 1869, at a point near Ogden, Utah, 
where the two construction parties met, and there, in the presence 
of many spectators, completed their tracks by the driving of a 
golden spike. 
East and West were now more effectively united than ever 
before. The most immediate result was to hasten the settlement 
of the Pacific Coast, and of the broad plains lying to the east of 
the Rocky Mountains. Pioneers, from the Atlantic Coast, or the 
Middle West, with their families, farm utensils, and live stock, 
might now reach the Far West in a week or so, whereas their 
fathers and grandfathers had taken weeks or months to travel to 
the Old Northwest or to the cotton country of the Southwest. 
Tens of thousands of earnest, hard-working men and women now 
poured into the country beyond the Missouri River, and divided 
it into farms. Frontier hamlets, such as Omaha, Kansas City, 
and Denver, grew into flourishing cities with almost the speed of 
mushrooms. County seats, schools, and churches appeared 
where only a few years before were Indian camps, villages of 
prairie dogs, and roving herds of buffalo and antelope. Within a 
single generation, or about thirty years, a large part of the once- 
dreaded American Desert was transformed into a land of peace, 
industry, and plenty.
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 HISTORY 
And further over, on pages 482 and 483, we read: 
423. The Panama Canal. Ever since the Spaniards discovered 
the Isthmus of Panama there has been more or less talk of cut- 
ting a canal through it, so that ocean-going vessels might easily 
pass to and fro between the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, 
not until 1881 was such a project actually started. In that year 
a French Panama Canal Company commenced operations; but 
after eight years they abandoned the task. 
For several years nothing further was done about the matter. 
‘The United States then made her first move. A few months after 
Theodore Roosevelt became President (in 1901), our Govern- 
ment signed a canal treaty with Great Britain. It was agreed 
between the two nations that the United States should dig this 
canal. When completed, it was to be our property and under our 
control; but it must be open to “vessels of commerce and of war 
of all nations . . . on terms of entire equality.” Therefore, we 
bought the rights and property of the French company for 
$40,000,000, and are now, as rapidly as possible, completing the 
canal which they had begun. 
Now that this work is finished, merchant and war vessels of 
the largest size, belonging to every nation of the world, may 
readily pass from one ocean to the other, and thus save the long 
and often perilous journey around South America. By this 
means our eastern and western coasts will be brought much 
nearer together than before; and the farmers and manufacturers 
of the great Mississippi Valley may then ship their goods direct to 
every port on the Pacific. 
Remarks. Let us return to our first paragraph and 
explain it. Prior to the introduction of railroads people 
were compelled to get along with water transportation, 
stage, etc., and had done so for generations. Then they 
began to recognize that this was a very slow method and 
looked around for a new one. This was their problem — 
to get more rapid means of transportation. The solution 
of this problem was found in England where a steam rail- 
road had been constructed. This idea was brought across 
the Atlantic and tried at Hoboken, New Jersey; and from 
Norz. The distance across the Isthmus, from ocean to ocean, at the site of the 
canal, is but forty and one half miles. In 1903 the United States acquired from the 
Republic of Panama a wide strip of land on either side of the canal, called the Canal 
Zone, which is governed by a commission appointed by the President.
-P-A-G-E-307
  
METHODS OF STUDY 291 
that point it spread rapidly all over the country. How 
did this solution work? Certain good results followed as 
mentioned in the text. 
These conditions lasted for a half-century or more and 
became old conditions, but the people began to see the 
defects of even railway transportation after a while. It 
did, to be sure, cheapen transportation, where water 
carriage was not possible, since it displaced expensive trans- 
portation by means of horses. But it was much more 
expensive than water transportation. So a new problem 
arose — that of improving the waterways. One attempt 
at solution is the Panama Canal. There were, at first, 
several defects in the plan. In the first place, the United 
States did not own the Isthmus of Panama; England had 
maritime rights there, and the French had some equity in an 
old canal. This gave rise to a number of problems which 
were solved in the following series: (1) A treaty with 
England satisfied English claims. (2) The United States 
secured from the Republic of Panama control of the Canal 
Zone. (8) Thereafter they purchased the French equity 
in the old canal. 
What the results of the Panama Canal, as a means of 
cheapening transportation, will be, is not yet known, be- 
cause it has not yet become history; nor do we yet know 
its defects. ‘That there will be some, giving rise to new 
problems and new solutions, is certain, unless history fails 
to repeat itself. 
Method of Handling Events. The usual plan of studying 
an event is to note its cause, describe the event, and list 
its results. A better method is to handle the event as the 
solution of a problem, and to have the six following topics 
under which to discuss it: (1) Old conditions; (2) Defects 
(giving rise to a problem); (3) Problem (to cure defects); 
(4) The event (the attempt at a solution); (5) The suc-
-P-A-G-E-308
  292 HISTORY 
cess of the solution; and (6) The defects of the solution 
itself. 
The first selection quoted would then be outlined as 
follows: 
Event: Introduction of Railroads 
(1) Old conditions — Water transportation and horse power. 
(2) Defects — Slowness and limitations. 
(3) Problem — Improvement of transportation. 
(4) Event — Introduction of railroad, then used in England. 
(5) Favorable results — (depicted in the quotation). 
(6) Defects — Greater expense compared with water trans- 
portation. 
The second quotation may be continued as a part of the 
foregoing beginning with (3): 
Problem — Cheapening of transportation. 
Event — Construction of Panama Canal. 
1. Treaty with England. 
2. Treaty with Panama. 
8. Purchase of French equity. 
Favorable results — (not yet known). 
Defects — (not yet known). 
The particular topics selected are not fitted to this scheme 
in any peculiar way. Any event can be handled in the 
same manner if desired. 
Summary. Events in history are merely solutions of problems. 
These problems arose because people were dissatisfied with their 
conditions and tried to improve them. Each event, then, may 
be studied under the six headings given several times in this 
section. 
Dates. Not many dates should be required of the pupils. 
The important ones have been mentioned above. In these 
particular lessons the following dates are given in the 
quotations: 
1826, Introduction of the steam railroad in the United States. 
1901, Canal treaty with England. 
1903, Treaty with Panama. 
The children may be expected to know these dates on
-P-A-G-E-309
METHODS OF STUDY 293 
the day of recitation, unless there are too many to learn. 
This the teacher should decide upon, and advise the children 
which to remember. Perhaps these can be condensed to 
two: 1826 and 1903. But in a later review none of these 
ought to be required of the pupils, because none are of 
first importance. It is sufficient to remember that railways 
were introduced early in the nineteenth century, and that 
the Panama Canal was begun about 1900. 
Summary. Only a few important dates should be memorized. 
Assignments. Country children have to study their 
lessons without having much time spent upon the assign- 
ment in class. The teacher, crowded for time, cannot read 
the lessons over with them in class before they study them. 
But the teacher can help them by giving them assignment 
problems to study. These may follow the scheme presented 
above. That is, the children may be expected to study 
each event under the six headings given above. They may 
read each topic and look for the old conditions, the defects, 
what happened, and its success, etc. This makes a very 
good sort of assignment and has the advantage of being 
used over and over again, so that the children do not need 
to have it written out for them each day. 
Drill. One particular thing needs to be drilled on in every 
lesson. That is not dates, but names; for one great reason 
for the failure to retain history is the failure to remember 
names. Teachers often allow a child in a recitation to 
speak of “that fellow back there” or “some man whose 
name I can’t remember,” and children often take a sort of 
pride in confessing this ignorance. It is often a current 
joke to pretend that they cannot pronounce the names; 
but if a boy cannot remember a name any further than to 
say, “that fellow back there,’ he is going to remember 
little of what happened. It should, therefore, be expected
-P-A-G-E-310
294 HISTORY 
of all pupils that they pronounce all important names cor- 
rectly and without hesitation. A teacher who does not 
require it is too lax in his requirements. Such a standard 
set up early in the year and adhered to works rapidly in 
bringing the children up to the requirements; for if they see 
that they are expected to master the names they will 
comply. 
Pupils should be required to know important facts in 
any lesson on the day for which it is assigned. The im- 
portant facts are those that are closely connected with the 
problems studied. For instance, they ought to know the 
causes of the Indian Wars, the main events in them, and 
the good and bad results, but minor details should not be 
required of them. They should drill upon these enough to 
remember them in class. © In reviews at the end of a history 
period, these facts should be in mind. When a review of 
several periods is to be made, perhaps only the events and 
their results on the history of the country need be remem- 
bered. As the period reviewed becomes longer and longer, 
the less important facts need not be required of the pupils. 
When a bird’s-eye view of American history is taken, only 
the great facts should be reviewed. But there are facts that 
should be drilled upon till they can never beforgotten. What 
these facts are every teacher must decide for himself, for no- 
body has worked them out well enough to suit every one. 
Summary. The recalling of events to be remembered for all 
time should be made automatic. The important facts for each 
day’s recitation should be required, but all the facts to be re- 
. membered to-day need not be required of the pupils at the end 
of the year. There is one standard for recitation and another for 
reviews. Names in particular should be drilled upon till pro- 
nounced with correctness and facility. 
Realness in History. We have said repeatedly that the 
more vivid and concrete history is made, the better for 
both interest and understanding.  
-P-A-G-E-311
  METHODS OF STUDY 295 
Several things, as we saw in geography, assist children 
in getting clear images of what is not present. For in- 
stance, in the transportation quotations, anecdotes showing 
how long it took people to travel from one place to another, 
how much it cost, and the difficulties in the way of all 
travel, will assist in making the children see the vitality of 
the people’s interest in railroads. These stories are not 
contained in the history lesson quoted and need to be 
collected, if possible, by the teacher. However, it can be 
best done by the author, which brings us back to my earlier 
statement, that the textbooks in history should contain a 
thousand pages instead of three hundred, and should not, 
even then, take up so many topics that full treatment may 
not be given to those selected. 
To aid the teacher in getting this material, reference 
books and historical stories should be placed in the library. 
Such lists are given in books referred to at the end of the 
chapter. 
Then, too, pictures are an aid to a more vivid description 
of events. Pictures of forms of early transportation, by 
stage, by horseback, by wagon,-and by steamboat, and of the 
early railroad trains, all lend interest; and later, pictures of 
the Panama Canal and an intimate study of its construction. 
Maps, too, lend their aid. A map showing transpor- 
tation routes both by rail and by proposed ocean way, is 
essential in the topics studied. 
Relics, costumes, models, and sand-table representations 
are other means of getting clearness in these subjects. 
Summary. The best way to get vividness in history study is 
by means of detailed stories and anecdotes which make the situa- 
tion concrete. Maps, pictures, and other forms of representation 
assist. The aim is to get the boy to see that history is merely 
his-story — a story into which he can throw himself with dramatic 
intensity, living over again the scenes as they were once lived by 
people of the past. 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
    296 HISTORY 
Current Events. It must be continually borne in the 
mind of the teacher that while history is interesting just to 
read for its own sake its chief value is found in showing how 
people in the past have solved the problems which confront 
us to-day. This being the case, current events, which is a 
name for problems which we are interested in to-day, are 
the most important items in history. Therefore, the 
teacher and the children must be readers of the newspapers 
in order to relate history to present problems. Most books 
on history carry events up to ten years ago and do not, and 
cannot, show how it is related to the problems of the present 
year. This task has to be performed by the teacher who, 
in teaching any event in the past, tries to show what it 
means in American life of the present year. 
History Notebooks. Notebooks in the hands of some 
teachers have done more to kill interest in history than 
any other single factor. There are some teachers who use 
history note-writing as their only kind of “busy work” to 
keep their pupils from getting into mischief. Such action 
is criminal. If notebooks are used in history, the contents 
should never consist of more than mere outlines. For if 
these books are to be used to recall facts, it is evident that 
the details can be secured from the text, and the outlines 
are all that need to be remembered. 
Some outline notebooks have many good points, such 
as those in which there are blank maps to be filled in, 
but not much of the space intended for writing should be 
used. 
Summary. Since notebooks are of use only for remembering 
important points, notes should be notes, and not treatises. 
Written Work. Most of the work done in history should 
be oral. Some writing is of use in fixing points in memory, 
but not much should be required, because, like excessive 
notebook work, it deadens interest. It is better to allow 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
METHODS OF STUDY 297 
a boy to devote the time that would otherwise be used in 
writing too much, to reading widely. For, undoubtedly, 
he absorbs much from reading history books, even if he 
cannot remember much of it in sufficiently definite form to 
state in words. 
Topical Questions. As in other subjects, so in history, 
questions should as far as practicable be topical. Let me 
illustrate from the paragraphs quoted upon the Isthmian 
Canal. The following questions might be asked: (1) Why 
did the people of the United States want a canal? (2) 
What was their first move? (3) What did the treaty 
say? (4) What happened next? (5) What is the Canal 
Zone? 
Here are five questions which might be shortened to two. 
(1) Why did the United States want to build the Panama 
Canal? (2) What were the events that happened before 
everything was finally ready to begin? 
A moment’s consideration will show that the second two 
questions will produce much better thinking and will give 
better ability in talking correctly than will the first five. 
In the first group the teacher does all the work. In the 
second two, the pupil does somewhat more nearly his share.

CHAPTER XI 
CIVICS 
1, Subject-Matter 
The Function of Civics. In no elementary-school subject 
has the change in content and function been so great 
within the past ten years as in the subject of Civics. The 
current textbooks on civics of ten years ago consisted of 
a description of local, state, and national governmental 
machinery, and the function of civics teaching at that time 
was to enable students to get an intelligent view of this 
machinery. The newer textbooks which have just begun 
to appear take a much wider view of the function of civics. 
They are built on the assumption that the function of 
civics is twofold. First, it should give the pupil an under- 
standing of the problems which he, as a citizen, will have to 
face. Second, it seeks to teach him how to participate in 
solving civic and social problems. 
The contrast can be very well illustrated by chapter 
headings of the old and new type of civic textbook. The 
older type of book had three main divisions into federal, 
state, and local government, and under federal government 
the legislative, executive, and judicial functions. This ran 
on down through the state organization to the city and 
municipal organizations, with descriptions of the offices, 
methods of voting, etc. The newer books have titles such 
as Problems of American Democracy, Community Life 
and Civic Problems, and their chapter headings run some- 
what as follows: The Family, The School, The Church, 
Health, The Police Force, Fire Protection and Prevention,
-P-A-G-E-316
  300 CIVICS 
Irrigation, Civic Beauty, Defectives, Criminals, Problems 
of Labor and Capital, and include also local, state, and 
national governments. 
Summary. The function of civics as it is now understood is to 
give the students an understanding of the problems which they 
will meet as citizens, to present them with the different types of 
solutions, and to induce them to participate as responsible citizens 
in the movements of the times to make conditions better. 
Ideals. Three ideals are of importance in civic efficiency. 
(1) The student should develop the ideal of open-minded- 
ness. He should appreciate the fact that there are two 
sides to any question, he should be able to sympathize with 
the other man’s point of view even though he feels that that 
point of view is wrong, and he should make his own de- 
cisions after having looked at the subject in a broad-minded 
way. (2) Scholarliness is important in handling civic 
problems. ‘The citizen needs to be a master of facts and 
base his conclusions upon fact rather than upon snap 
judgments and indefinite and inaccurate information. (3) 
The ideal of participation in civic life must be developed. 
It is not enough for the citizen to understand the problems 
and be open-minded. He must go to the polls, join or- 
ganizations, and throw himself into the actual work of 
making his community and nation a better place in which 
to live. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. (1) The teacher should him- 
self take an interested part in the civic life of the community. 
(2) He should give the children practice, in school and out, 
through the socialized recitation, clubs, organizations, etc., 
in carrying out the ideas which the student believes to be 
worth while. (8) The teacher should see to it that the 
pupils have a sound knowledge of the facts which are 
pertinent to the proper handling of civic problems. (4) 
He should teach the children to think about these problems
-P-A-G-E-317
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 301 
and not to depend upon partisan prejudices and community 
conditions. The development of the ideal of open-minded- 
ness in the pupils is one of the important objectives of the 
teacher. 
The Content of the Course. The inexperienced teacher 
must, in the last analysis, follow the adopted textbook 
rather closely, and at the present time two types of text- 
books are commonly used in the school. These are referred 
to above. ‘There is the old type which deals only with 
governmental machinery and the new type which takes a 
broader view of the subject. The content of the newer 
texts has already been referred to and their richness, in 
comparison with the old type, is apparent from a reading of 
the chapter headings that have been quoted. 
The type of material taken up in these topics may be 
illustrated from one of the textbooks in its handling of the 
chapter on the school. This deals with the methods of 
learning and contains some discussion of instincts and 
their control, the importance of youth, the development 
of the American school, and recent educational progress, 
methods of controlling the school through taxes and school 
boards, the problem of school attendance, the reasons why 
people go to school, the money value of education, and how 
to get the most out of school. 
While I have not made a practice of listing textbooks in 
connection with methods of teaching as presented in this 
text, I depart from this practice to mention three of the 
newer types of books for the information of teachers who 
have to teach the old type of governmental civics and who 
may be interested in looking over some of the newer books. 
These books are selected at random and I mention them 
without making any reference to the relative importance of 
any particular book. The three books which I have before 
me are Burch and Patterson’s Problems of American De-
-P-A-G-E-318
  302 CIVICS 
mocracy, published by Macmillan, Hill’s Community Life and 
Civic Problems, published by Ginn & Co., and Hughes’s 
Problems of American Democracy, published by Allyn & 
Bacon. 
Materials for the Course. The teacher of civics does not 
need to, and should not, depend upon the basic text. There 
is so much material to be found in books and current mag- 
azines and newspapers that no teacher can present valid 
excuses for not having a very rich course in the subject. 
The children love to collect information which bears upon 
the topics under discussion in the school, so that through 
the combined efforts of teacher and pupils the course can 
be made very valuable. Nor is the teacher confined to 
books, for within the community itself there is a great deal 
of information to be obtained through interviews. ‘The 
school trustees, the county representative, the county 
judge, the county officers, the minister, and other leaders 
in the community have information which they are glad 
- to give to the children when they come to them for material 
for school use. These interviews are worth while not only 
because of the information collected but particularly be- 
cause they help the children to get into the current of com- 
munity life and begin early to get an adult attitude toward 
the problems which concern their fathers and mothers. 
Problems and Projects. Civics is best taught by the 
problem method, and projects can be entered into from 
time to time. 
A recent book of great interest to rural school teachers is 
by Collings, and is entitled An Experiment with a Project 
Curriculum. It contains much that has a vital connection 
with civics. While this book is of particular significance 
to teachers of rural schools because it shows how the 
country school can be organized upon a project basis, it is 
at the same time suggestive to all teachers whether they
-P-A-G-E-319
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 303 
are able to follow up his plans completely or not. A few of 
the projects selected at random are the following. Ata 
time when a well-known criminal was being tried the stu- 
dents followed this trial through quite carefully in order to 
see how court machinery works. They studied the League 
of Nations, which at that time was a current interest, and 
a community meeting was held under the auspices of the 
school, at which both sides presented their case. The fol- 
lowing list of problems, growing out of the community inter- 
ests, is very suggestive for teachers in other communities. 
. How our school election is conducted. 
. How our taxes are collected at Pineville. 
. How our road boss is appointed. 
. What our taxes are used for at Pineville. 
How Mr. Smith cares for the prisoners in the county jail. 
Why the county Republican Committee believed that they 
should be elected at a crossroads political meeting. 
. What our county officers do at Pineville. 
. How sick people are cared for in the Pineville hospital. 
. How the MacDonald county bank handles our money. 
. How the people of our community vote at the general 
November election at the Bethpage polling. SONI AMewWOe a 
The titles of the foregoing problems will undoubtedly 
appeal to the readers, as they do to me, because the problems 
are concrete and practical. They have a kind of interest 
which is very appealing to children because through them 
they are introduced into the adult life of the community, 
which, up to this time, has been mysterious to them and 
whose study now brings a glow of satisfaction from their 
feeling that they are practically old enough to get insight 
into them. Moreover, such problems are not difficult to 
find. Any alert teacher can select double the number that 
he is able to handle during the course of the year. 
Grading Material. With this larger view of civics ac- 
cepted, it is apparent that the children can begin to study 
civics in the very early grades in an incidental way. For
-P-A-G-E-320
  804 CIVICS 
instance, they learn a.good deal about governmental ma- 
chinery in history. They are brought into contact with 
problems of health through hygiene, which is studied in 
the lower grades. They pick up a good deal of information 
about the school. They know much about recreation and 
have some notion of civic duty. Afterwards the systematic 
study of civics had best begin in the seventh and eighth 
grades at a time when the children are beginning to attain 
the maturity which is necessary for an understanding of the 
underlying principles and causes which operate in com- 
munity life and the machinery by which civic life is regu- 
lated. 
2. Interest 
The methods of developing interest in the textbook on 
civics are the same as those used in other textbook subjects, 
but in addition to this the teacher who uses the problem 
method of attacking civics is able to fall back upon a whole 
set of interests which are not available for some other 
subjects. This is the interest in the social life of the com- 
munity. When such problems as those listed above, from 
Collings, are presented to the children the appeal is im- 
mediate. They want to know about these things because 
they have always wondered about them, and this interest 
can be maintained at a high level if the teacher is careful 
not to make the teaching too bookish. By this I do not 
mean that the children should not read books, magazine 
articles, newspapers, etc.; I rather mean that as they read 
them they should keep in mind the fact that they are col- 
lecting information for such problems as these. As a 
matter of fact the problem method of teaching invariably 
causes the children to read very much more material than 
they would use if it were assigned to them and to read it 
with greater interest and more intelligence,
-P-A-G-E-321
  METHODS OF STUDY 305 
Then, too, the teacher can rely upon interest in making 
excursions and seeking interviews with the people of the 
community. The adults are always glad to talk to school 
children on such problems, and the children feel a great 
deal of immature importance in visiting a man or woman 
for the sake of getting information for the school. Further- 
more, the children like to be in on the planning of little 
projects which they are able to carry through. Sometimes 
they put on campaigns for school ‘betterment, such as a 
new fence, a better school library, or a phonograph. Such 
campaigns develop leadership on the one hand and the 
ability to work in organized groups on the other, for in 
every group somebody naturally becomes a leader and un- 
suspected abilities are discovered. ‘Teamwork in organized 
groups in school is an excellent field for practice which will 
be useful in adult life. One of the greatest difficulties of 
the farmer is that he is an individualist and does not take 
readily to working in organizations. This can be overcome 
if he is caught young and trained in working with other 
people. 
Summary. Interest in civics is easy to secure for three reasons 
— first, the children are interested in learning the mysteries of 
adult civic life; second, excursions and interviews stimulate in- 
terest; and, third, projects and campaigns directed toward the 
improvement of specific conditions are fascinating to children. 
3. Methods of Study 
Socialized Activities. The teacher who is interested in 
developing the ideal of participation in civic enterprises can 
give a great deal of practice to the children in school if he 
utilizes the possibilities for group organization. Cus- 
tomarily children study their lessons separately and are 
individually responsible for their work to the teacher. 
Thirty children in the school are thirty units, each re- 
sponsible for his own work.
-P-A-G-E-322
306 CIVICS 
But it has been demonstrated by many teachers that it 
is possible to have them work in groups. Sometimes this 
takes the form of a socialized recitation where, first, each 
individual is responsible for a particular part of the lesson 
for which the others are not responsible, as in collateral 
reading. Second, groups of two or three children may work 
together and report upon a specific part of the assigned 
lesson. ‘Third, the class as a whole may be organized. 
Sometimes the teacher appoints a chairman, or has a 
leader appointed, with committees and subcommittees, 
and sometimes the teacher becomes the chairman who 
directs the work while seeking the advice of the children 
about how best to carry it on. In addition to using the 
socialized recitation, clubs are organized for one purpose 
or another. There may be good language clubs, music 
clubs, health clubs, or any one of a number. From the 
point of view of civics it is important that one such club, 
at least, should be developed in each school, where parlia- 
mentary law is taught. A chairman, secretary, treasurer, 
and committees should be appointed, and the meetings 
should be conducted strictly according to the established 
rules of law and order. Moreover, the teacher should see 
that the clubs actually work. This means that they should 
set up certain objectives and the chairman should see that. 
what they attempt to do is actually accomplished. 
It is probably safe to say that while the most important 
subject in the course of study is reading, civics belongs to 
the second group, in which also belong music, literature, 
art, and history. I place very great importance upon 
civic club work and my reason for doing so is that the 
handling of social and civic problems in a community 
through organized activity is extremely important in im- 
proving living conditions and in enriching the lives of the 
people of a community. If we can make an intelligent

METHODS OF STUDY 307 
community that is working for social betterment all things 
else will follow. 
Textbook Study. In view of the fact that most rural 
school teachers are still confronted with the problem of 
- teaching the older type of civics, I think it wise to discuss 
methods of handling such a book, for it is perfectly clear 
that if the teacher can adopt the problem attitude toward 
the teaching of civics he will be able to develop a very 
useful and interesting course for his children. The re- 
mainder of the chapter, therefore, will be devoted to the 
study of methods of using the older type of book. 
Governmental Machinery. There are three classes of 
governmental machinery: local, state, and national. Each 
of these performs different duties, and a citizen has some 
participation in each. For instance, he votes for people 
to represent him in Congress, in the state legislature, 
and in the local offices. He may also pay taxes to sup- 
port local, state, and national institutions. In the first 
two cases, the tax is a direct tax; in the third, the taxes are 
indirect. 
It is not necessary to give the details of the machinery 
of government here, since they can be found in every text- 
book on civics. But, as our purpose in this chapter is to 
deal with problems in the teaching of the subject, we shall 
lay emphasis upon a few pedagogical points. 
National Government. Civics is frequently studied in 
connection with history, and with good results; for in 
history we see the growth of the institutions and agencies 
that govern the nation, and the causes that have made 
them as they are, and we realize that even though they may 
not suit every one, they are in the main the best for the 
whole nation. 
However, the machinery of which we get the best view 
in the study of American history, in the schools, is the  
-P-A-G-E-324
  308 CIVICS 
National Government. We see how the constitution was 
framed, we study its clauses, we get’ an understanding of the 
powers and duties of Congress, of the federal judiciary, and 
of the President. Less attention can be paid to state 
government and still less to the local government, because 
the history studied is a national history, and only in- 
cidentally a state or local history. 
The best place, then, to study national government is 
in correlation with history, because it shows the develop- 
ment, and growth, and general fairness of the national 
constitution and laws. 
When governmental functions are studied in history, 
however, care should be taken that the pupils are not left 
with a purely abstract hold upon them. They should know 
who the leading officers are, such as their congressman, 
state senators, the President, etc. They should be ac- 
quainted with methods of election, the story of the attempts 
to pass amendments to the constitution, and such other 
facts as those interested in voting need to know to exercise 
intelligent suffrage and citizenship. 
Local Government. But it must be acknowledged by. 
everybody that the average citizen is touched much more 
closely by local government than by state government, and 
more closely by state government than by national govern- 
ment. And it is here that civics studied merely in relation 
to history has its great weakness. The government that 
touches the pupil least is given the most attention, and that 
which is closest to him is studied least. 
- Points of Emphasis. Because of this weakness, there 
should be considerable study of local and state government 
apart from history. This may seem difficult in an over- 
crowded program; but, if necessary, one history period a 
week may be set aside for this purpose. Or, at certain’ 
times in the year — for instance, when school, local, and
-P-A-G-E-325
  METHODS OF STUDY 309 
state elections occur — several history hours may be set 
aside for the study of civics. 
Systematic Study. In such periods a systematic course 
in civics may be studied. The local officers of the county, 
village, and school district in which the pupils live may 
each be examined from day to day and an effort be made 
to establish a systematic understanding of the whole 
system. And the same thing may be done for state govern- 
ment. 
Civics has, unfortunately, the same difficulty to contend 
with that any systematic study has. It may not get into 
close contact with the pupils’ lives. When they get 
through, they may not know what to do in concrete cases 
with which they are confronted from day to day. 
Concrete Problems. So instead of a systematic study, 
the following plan may be substituted: Begin with some 
concrete problems that may face the pupils, and study 
governmental machinery to see how it is handled. A num- 
ber of illustrations will make this clear, and show how 
easy the method is in application. The only requirement 
is that some governmental problems that are interesting to 
the pupils shall be selected. 
School Taxes. A teacher is safe in beginning the study of 
one branch of government with the school tax. The tax 
is a sure point of interest, because all know the reluctance 
with which people, and especially farmers, pay taxes; and 
their sons and daughters have enough acquaintance with 
this to make them likewise interested. The school they 
are well acquainted with, and so the combination of school 
and taxes is interesting. 
No one set of problems is the best. A teacher may make 
up any list that he prefers. The following is a series that 
is intended to be merely suggestive and to apply particularly 
to Missouri. The questions might be:
-P-A-G-E-326
310 
(1) 
(2) 
(8) 
4) 
  CIVICS 
How much money did it take to run this school dis- 
trict last year? This necessitates getting the in- 
formation from the district clerk, and the class thus 
meets its first official. 
Where does this money come from? This leads toa 
consideration of the sources. These are: 
(a) Local levy. 
(6) State apportionment. 
(c) County tax. 
(d) Tuition. 
If (b) is taken up, this question may be asked: 
How is the apportionment made? This gives a fine 
opportunity in Missouri to show what happens if a 
child misses school for a day, and will give, also, a 
chance to see where the state revenue that is appor- 
tioned comes from. 
If (a) is taken up, many questions arise, such as 
Who determines the levy? What is the limit of 
levy? Suppose you ran a nine-months school, how 
much would the levy have to be increased? Or, If 
you build a new building at a cost of $800, what 
might the levy be? How does your present levy 
compare with the levies in the nearest towns? 
These questions lead back to assessed valuation and the 
study of the assessor as a public officer. 
When you pay your taxes, to whom are they paid? 
This gives an introduction to the collector. 
Many other problems of a like sort can easily be arranged 
by the teacher, and may be pushed as far as desired. 
‘Their advantage is that when the pupils have finished such 
a study, they know many points of government that they 
will have to deal with every day. 
When annual school meetings occur, they should be used 
by the teacher as the basis for a study of questions of
-P-A-G-E-327
  
METHODS OF STUDY 811 
organization; and eighth-grade pupils should be encouraged 
to attend such meetings. 
Miscellaneous County Officers. A few questions will show 
the concrete method of approaching the subject of county 
officers. 
(1) The Recorder. If you wanted to buy a piece of land, 
but were not sure that the title was clear, how would 
you find out about it? If one wishes to be married, 
to whom will he go to get a license? 
(2) The County Court. Who fixes the county tax levy? 
If you did some work for the county, to whom would 
you present your bill? Who looks after the county 
poor farm? If you wanted to open a new road, to 
whom would you apply for permission? Then, a 
study of the method of appointing the county court 
could be made. 
(8) Coroner. If some person were found dead on the 
road, who would be notified? 
(4) One question may bring in several officers; as, if 
a man is suspected of murder, who handles the case? 
These officers would include the sheriff, the prose- 
cuting attorney, etc. 
(5) Surveyor. If you have a dispute with a neighbor about 
a line fence, what officer can settle it for you? 
As said above, these are only a very few suggestive ques- 
tions. But they illustrate a method that works very well in 
practice both for local government, as has been illustrated 
here, and for state government as well. However, if I had 
forty lessons to spend on civics in a year, I should spend 
at least thirty on local government, and not more than ten 
on state government. 
Use of Books. Such a course as outlined would not follow 
any text, but it would need several books easy to secure. 
One of these would be the adopted textbook. To this
-P-A-G-E-328
312 CIVICS 
should be added a few other single copies of other texts on 
civics for the library. Several copies of the school law 
should be available. (State Statutes are probably too 
cumbersome for use and too hard in many cases.) With 
these books available, that teacher who has never tried 
the plan will be surprised to see the amount eighth-grade 
boys and girls can dig out of a school law for themselves, 
if the teacher will show them how to use the index and 
direct them in their searching. It is, of course, a well- 
known fact that country pupils can do more for themselves 
than city pupils. The reason is that they have to, because 
they are not able to summon the teacher to their assistance 
whenever they feel that they need help. 
How can a List of Problems be secured? The way in 
which I secured these problems to-day was to take a book 
on civics, look up all the officers and see what the duties of 
_each were. Then I asked some simple questions that 
would illustrate how these officers came in contact with the 
pupils. For instance, I found in the text that “the recorder 
of deeds keeps a record of all deeds, mortgages, and other 
documents having to do with the title or ownership of 
property. . . . It is also his duty to issue and keep a record 
of all marriage licenses.” Other questions than those I 
asked might have been selected, but I selected these as an 
introduction, chiefly because they are of general interest 
and are pretty sure to appeal to boys and girls. 
The plan of making questions is, therefore, very simple.

CHAPTER XII 
ARITHMETIC 
1. Subject-Matter 
Function. We have seen in each chapter that each subject 
taught in school has a specific function to perform and one 
which no other subject can fulfill. In this chapter we shall 
see that arithmetic is no exception to this rule. For, while 
geography assists us by taking care of our knowledge of 
climate and physiography, while spelling looks after the 
order of letters in words, and while history records and or- 
ganizes the past for us, arithmetic offers its share of assist- 
ance by handling number or quantity for us. Whenever 
we have to decide questions concerning how many or how 
much we go to arithmetic. 
This, of course, is very important because we do all our 
buying and selling by quantity. When we build a house 
we need to know how much material and how many dollars 
it will take. We use number to arrange the school program 
for a day, so many minutes for recitation, so many for 
study, etc. The housewife has to deal with quantities in 
the kitchen, dining-room, and living-room. Everybody, 
every day, makes use of arithmetic every hour of the day. 
Number has been such a fascinating subject since it was 
first studied centuries ago that in every age there have been 
many brilliant men studying it, who have laid down a 
great body of rules and principles that help to explain and 
control number. 
Until a few years ago all teachers of arithmetic laid great 
stress upon the use of arithmetic as an excellent means of 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  
SUBJECT-MATTER 315 
training one to think accurately. They claimed that if a 
child learned to think accurately in arithmetic he would 
be greatly benefited in his thinking in every other subject 
and in life. But many recent experiments have shown that 
while the study of arithmetic may make pupils think more 
accurately in arithmetic it does not have a very great effect 
upon their thinking in other fields. For instance, an ex- 
pert mathematician may be quite illogical in politics or 
may not think at all clearly when he tries to trade a horse. 
So it is better for teachers when trying to explain the value 
of arithmetic to lay but little stress upon this point and to 
deal only with its intrinsic function. 
Summary. The function of arithmetic is to enable people to 
handle number so that they may do the things they like to do | 
which depend upon knowledge of number for their accomplish- 
ment. The indirect functions are not of importance outside of 
the subject. 
Ideals. In the teaching of arithmetic there are three out- 
standing ideals which need to be developed. (1) The most 
important of these is accuracy. When people are engaged. 
upon some important problem in which arithmetic is in- 
volved, it is often disastrous to make mistakes in com- 
putation. (2) But it is found that accuracy runs very 
closely parallel with speed, which is the second ideal. In 
general, the rapid computer in arithmetic is the most accu- 
rate, when he has developed a natural rate of speed and 
maintains it, rather than seeking to perform speed stunts. 
(3) Along with these two fundamental ideals of accuracy 
and speed, is included the ideal of ability to reason. 
That is to say, children should seek in performing their 
arithmetic to think things out rather than to memorize 
them mechanically. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. Five objectives may be se- 
lected for the teacher to seek to accomplish. (1) The 
JF3B 
es < ‘
-P-A-G-E-332
316 ARITHMETIC 
first of these to be mentioned is to develop a liking for 
arithmetic. The reason for this is the often repeated one 
in each chapter. If children do not like arithmetic they 
will neither learn it nor use it. The second, third, and 
fourth objectives may be listed together as the develop- 
ment of speed, accuracy, and the ability to reason. The 
development of these ideals becomes, in arithmetic, very 
distinctly an objective for the teacher. The fifth objective 
is the furnishing of practical problems. Arithmetic, as a 
textbook subject, is of little value in comparison with its 
use to the pupil in his everyday life. But it has been found 
that if the teacher teaches only the textbook problems 
the children have great difficulty in seeing how those 
problems apply in their practical out-of-school life. So, 
because they face this difficulty, it is necessary for the 
teacher to collect from every source that he can, the actual 
problems that are used by children and their fathers and 
mothers in ordinary life outside of school. 
The Course of Study. There has been a great deal of 
discussion for many years about what should be included 
in the course of study in arithmetic. Continuous criticism 
is made of the textbooks on the grounds that many processes 
no longer used by people are included, through the in- 
fluence of tradition, and that the problems used as exercises 
are not real problems. 
To determine just what arithmetic is needed in order to 
handle practical affairs is difficult, but several attempts 
have been made. The most thorough of these attempts 
has been that of G. M. Wilson, who collected nearly fifteen 
thousand problems from about four thousand people who 
were parents of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade children 
in country, small town, and city schools. He classified 
these problems and found that nearly ten thousand prob- 
lems involved buying, fifteen hundred selling, and fifteen  
-P-A-G-E-333
  SUBJECT-MATTER 317 
hundred involved money where there was neither buying 
nor selling. The problems involving money took in eighty- 
three per cent of all the problems. He found by 
another classification that the problems on labor and 
wages constituted forty-five per cent of all the problems, 
interest eleven per cent, rent six per cent, insurance four 
per cent. Then he studied the arithmetical processes 
needed in handling each problem and discovered roughly 
that for sixty-nine cases of multiplication there were 
forty-four of addition, twenty-eight of subtraction, twenty- 
four of division, twenty of fractions, twelve of accounts, 
and four of percentage. A number of conclusions were 
drawn from the study which will not be given here ex- 
cept to indicate some of the things which these people 
did not use at all. The omitted items include the Greatest 
Common Denominator and the Least Common Multiple; 
long confusing problems in common fractions; complex 
and compound fractions; reduction of denominate num- 
bers; longitude and time; cases two and three in percent- 
age; compound interest; exchange; true discount; most 
of mensuration; cube root, and the metric system. 
These conclusions are not general. They are merely 
based upon the arithmetic needed in the fifteen thousand 
problems which he collected, but they are of value to the 
teacher in giving some idea of the items in the textbook for 
which the ordinary child will probably not have very 
much use. If the child goes on to high school the situa- 
tion is somewhat different. The material is presented 
merely as a matter of interest without recommendation on 
my part. 
Thorndike has summarized the knowledge which he be- 
lieves children should possess as follows: (1) A working 
knowledge of the meanings of numbers. (2) A working 
knowledge of the system of decimal notation. (3) A
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 ARITHMETIC 
working knowledge of the meanings of addition, subtrac- 
tion, multiplication, and division. (4) A working knowledge 
of the nature and relations of certain common measures. 
(5) Working ability to add, subtract, multiply, divide, with 
integers, common and decimal fractions, and denominate 
numbers, all being real, positive numbers. (6) Working 
knowledge of words, symbols, diagrams, and the like as 
required by life’s simplest arithmetical demands or by 
economical preparation therefor. (7) The ability to apply 
all the above, including the ability to solve problems 
concerning the areas of rectangles, volume of rectangular 
solids, percentage, interest, and certain other common 
occurrences in household, factory, and business life. 
Summary. The course of study in arithmetic should be con- 
fined to the arithmetical processes which are necessary skillfully 
to work out life’s common arithmetical calculations. 
When to Teach Arithmetic. There is a growing tendency 
to delay the teaching of arithmetic as a separate subject. 
Systematic arithmetic is so difficult for little children that 
if they are allowed to wait until they are more mature they 
will learn it more rapidly and understand it better. The 
time that is ordinarily devoted to arithmetic in the first 
grade can be better spent upon handicrafts work, in playing 
games, and in reading. Indeed, while they are doing these 
things they are picking up incidentally and naturally a 
good deal of arithmetic which, because it is learned natu- 
rally, is understood by them. 
All schools used to start systematic arithmetic in the 
first grade. More recently many schools leave it to the 
second grade and a few do not begin it until the third grade. 
Some authorities advise postponing it until the fourth grade. 
In ny opinion, arithmetic can be safely left until the fourth 
grade when textbooks are prepared with the intention of 
teaching it from that point on through the eighth grade.
-P-A-G-E-335
  SUBJECT-MATTER 319 
Difficulties. Any consideration of the course of study in 
arithmetic must take into account the difficulty of per- 
forming arithmetical operations. It is perfectly clear that 
not all parts of arithmetic are equally difficult. For in- 
stance, in addition it is much easier to learn 5 + 5 than 
8+5. Asa matter of fact, it has been discovered that the 
most difficult addition combinations to learn are those in 
the center of the table, as 7+ 5, 7+ 4, 8+ 5, 8+ 3, 
9+.5, etc. It has been demonstrated that pupils who can 
add 8 + 5 sometimes have difficulty in adding 5 + 8. 
A great deal of work has been done in studying the rela- 
tive difficulty of arithmetical facts. It has been discovered 
that most errors belong to recurring types. For example, 
sixty per cent of the errors made by eighth-grade pupils in 
working tests on addition of fractions were due to the addi- 
tion of the numerators for a new numerator and also the 
adding of the denominators for the new denominator, as, ~ 
for example, 3/5-+1/5 = 4/10. It is apparent from 
the foregoing facts that efficient teachers of arithmetic 
must diagnose with definiteness the difficulties of their 
pupils if they are going to develop efficiency without 
waste. When children make mistakes the first duty of 
the teacher is to find out the cause and seek to cure it 
rather than merely to mark the exercise wrong and ask 
that it be done over. This is particularly true because 
many children have individual difficulties of their own 
which other pupils do not possess. This diagnosis can be 
made through standard tests which will be mentioned later, 
but it can also be made in connection with the ordinary 
exercises which are given for practice. If children are 
given a test in fractions the teacher should pay more atten- 
tion to the mistakes than to the correct results. A short 
study of the mistakes will be very illuminating to the teacher 
and will naturally show him what to do in order to make the
-P-A-G-E-336
Ae ee gp ee 
320 ARITHMETIC 
work efficient. When, for instance, the teacher has seen 
that some of his pupils add the numerators for the new 
numerator and the denominators for the new denominator 
in fractions, he has a very specific difficulty to cure. He 
has to invent some method of showing the students ex- 
actly how addition of fractions is carried on. He will see 
also that his teaching up to date has not been particularly 
effective in that particular respect. 
Standard Tests. Two types of standard tests in arith- 
metic have been worked out for teachers — tests of reason- 
ing and tests of ability to use the fundamental operations. 
Tests of reasoning have been made by Stone, by Curtis, 
by Monroe, and by others. Tests upon the fundamental 
operations have been made by Curtis, Woody, and others. 
Of these the ones which are most widely used are the 
Curtis and Monroe tests. A description of the tests will 
be found in the Monroe reference at the end of the chapter, 
in Measuring the Results of Teaching. 
Ability on the part of the pupils to use the fundamental 
operations is not a complete test of the teacher’s ability 
to teach arithmetic, nor does ability to perform these 
operations guarantee skill in reasoning. But it cannot be 
denied that inability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide 
with skill will permanently handicap a student in efforts to 
work problems involving other operations. Viewed from 
. this angle, skill in performing the fundamental operations 
is very important. 
2. Interest 
Immediate Interest. As in the other subjects treated, 
so in arithmetic there are pupils who enjoy the work for its 
own sake and who derive pleasure from working arithmetic 
problems. From the studies that have been made it is 
quite interesting to note the number of pupils who prefer 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  INTEREST 321 
arithmetic to any other subject. For instance, in a com- 
parison of arithmetic and history, 327 liked arithmetic 
greatly while 96 greatly disliked it, as against 164 who liked 
history greatly and 113 who greatly disliked it. To such 
pupils the subject is said to have immediate interest. 
In order to intensify children’s liking for arithmetic it is 
important that the work should be gone over carefully 
and slowly. It should be simple enough to keep the pupils 
from growing discouraged and sufficient drive should be 
put into the teaching to have the children see that they 
are making actual improvement. 
Specific Function. Both for the pupils who do not like 
arithmetic and for those who do it is important that they 
be introduced to it through its use, and that once intro- 
duced the idea of usefulness in practical life be kept con- 
stantly before them. It is normally introduced in the 
early grades in connection with plays, games, and handi- 
crafts, where a knowledge of arithmetic is necessary in the 
carrying out of activities of one sort and another. Its 
usefulness is developed in application to all sorts of prac- 
tical problems which are collected by the teacher from the 
textbook and other sources. 
Handicrafts. Boys who like to work with tools find that 
they cannot get very far in making things without measur- 
ing and computing. Primary children in paper cutting 
and all forms of handwork also need to count and measure. 
Cases of the use of multiplication, division, addition and 
subtraction, and even fractions, arise in the course of a 
year in the lower grades and somewhat more complicated 
processes occur in the upper grades. 
When such operations occur in work which is enjoyed 
by the pupils they perform them with interest and some- 
times without even thinking or knowing that they are 
using arithmetic. It frequently happens in the higher 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
322 ARITHMETIC 
grades that boys who have never liked arithmetic begin to 
take an interest in it and show marked proficiency when they 
have found it of use at some time in manual training or 
agriculture. 
Games. It is a well-known fact that such a game as 
dominoes gives pupils marked ability in addition and sub- 
traction. This game played with little cards which have 
the domino marks on them may safely be played by two 
children in school on the top of a table or desk unless cer- 
tain benighted parents object too strenuously. Other 
simple games such as “odd or even,” “ hully gully hand- 
ful,” “bean bag,” and “ring toss,” come quickly to mind 
as games that are played during school hours in many 
schools. To these may be added a number of games that 
are played out of school, games which the teacher may 
teach the children with the idea in the back of his head 
that they will get training in arithmetic. These include 
crokinole, flinch, marbles, numerical modifications of 
“Simon Says Thumbs Up” and so on. Such games have, 
of course, many other values in education, but we discuss 
them here only in relation to arithmetic. A selected list of 
number games is appended in the references at the end of 
the chapter. 
Practical Problems. Interest attaches itself to arith- 
metic when problems taken from the life of the pupils at 
home are chosen. Agriculture in the country offers hun- 
dreds of these problems for rural schools. Measuring 
land, stacks of hay, and bins of wheat, estimating the cost 
of lumber for a barn, the percentage of gain in crops due 
to spraying, the rations for cattle and horses, and the profits 
in wheat raising are a few examples which show the richness 
of this source of interest. 
Children may be asked to collect such problems from their 
parents as Wilson did in collecting the fifteen thousand 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
INTEREST 323 
arithmetic problems mentioned before. In collecting these 
problems the grammar-grade children may be asked to 
have their fathers and mothers keep mental track of ques- 
tions in arithmetic that may come up and the children will 
write them down to bring to school. Arithmetic texts are 
including more and more of these practical problems every 
year, but the alert teacher does not need to depend upon 
the texts. He can make up problems for himself, and he 
ought to do so if he wishes his work to be efficient. 
The use of such problems will undermine the criticism of 
business men and others that when children get through 
school they may know some arithmetic but they are un- 
able to use it in ordinary, practical life situations. 
Other Sources. Thorndike shows that through the in- 
terest in physical action arithmetic may be taught by 
having the children march in files of two, three, four, and 
so on; by raising the arms once, twice, etc.; by showing a 
foot and yard and inch with the hands; by making pictures 
of fractional parts; by cutting strips of paper; by folding 
paper, and so on. He also mentions the use of tricks and 
magic as an occasional source of interest. For instance, 
children may dictate to the teacher three numbers for 
addition, such as 357, 682, and 793. These the teacher 
will place on the board and to them add 642, 317, and 206. 
Then the teacher can immediately say to the children 
“The sum of these six numbers is 2997.” This will make 
the children think that the teacher is a wizard, but as a 
matter of fact he is not, for if you will notice the first term 
of the first number in each of the two sets — 357-642 — 
you will see that their sum is 999. So for the other two 
pairs, and all the teacher has to do is multiply 999 by three 
in order to get 2997. Or he can do it much more quickly 
by saying that the sum of the numbers is 3000 minus 
three.
-P-A-G-E-340
824 ARITHMETIC 
When I taught in the country school I used a similar 
device where I gave the children five or more figures to add. 
If I had used only three the children might have found out 
the trick. Let us take, for example, 812, 743, 315, 188, 
and 257. I knew at once that the sum of these was 2315. 
It will be noticed that it corresponds to the third number 
with a two in front of it. The trick is very simple. The 
idea is to put down three numbers selected at random and 
then below two more, such that, in this case, the first and 
fourth numbers equal 1000, and the second and fifth also 
equal 1000. This plan saves the teacher a great deal of 
work in addition and during the two years that I used it the 
children did not discover the trick. 
Summary. Immediate interest in arithmetic may be present. 
If not, an appeal can be made to other interests and particularly 
through the intrinsic function of arithmetic in its use in hand- 
icrafts, plays and games, and practical problems, all admin- 
istered in such a way as to give arithmetical practice and 
intelligence. 
Records of Improvement. The children’s knowledge of 
previous performance is a. powerful factor in contributing 
to their improvement in arithmetic. When children see 
that they can do arithmetic more rapidly and more accu- 
rately to-day than they could a week ago, they are given a 
strong stimulus for additional work. In this respect they 
are following the natural laws of the human mind. Every 
person has a tendency to become interested in the thing in 
which he sees he is becoming more and more efficient. 
To help the children to see that they are improving, the 
teacher needs to use tests. The standard tests may be used, 
but even where they are not used the teacher may make up 
tests which are not too difficult and give them at intervals 
of a week or so, or the same test may be repeated at in- 
tervals so far apart that the children will not remember it. 
In such a case the comparison is not absolutely scientific,
-P-A-G-E-341
THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 325 
but it is sufficiently accurate to be justified for practical 
purposes. In all such tests the children should be ex- 
amined for both speed and accuracy. It is highly desirable 
that the teacher should use the standard tests as a part of 
his equipment, and obviously when the tests, either stand- 
ard or home-made, are given, the children’s progress should 
be recorded and the records made accessible to them. 
Projects. Arithmetic is concerned with projects in three 
ways. (1) It may be used in other projects which involve 
quantity. In such a case we do not have an arithmetic 
project; we use arithmetic in connection with projects. 
(2) Improvement in arithmetic may be made a project. 
That is to say, the problem of increasing their skill in the 
handling of the fundamental operations, fractions, etc., 
is put up to the children. They talk this over with the- 
teacher, discuss directions, keep records, study the im- 
provement, and lack of improvement, devise new methods 
of study, allow themselves to be tested again, and so on. 
(3) There are a number of projects in arithmetic given in 
Projects for the Elementary Grades, by C. H. Elliot and 
Chas. S. Crow, and in Projects for Grades IV, V, and VI, 
by the same authors, also in Major Projects in the Ele- 
mentary School, by Flora C. Fox, Federal Board of Educa- 
tion Bulletin No. 36. 
3. The Study of Arithmetic 
Ten Causes of Waste. Klapper has made a very in- 
teresting analysis of the causes of waste in the recitation. 
These are summarized as follows: (1) Time is often lost 
because of the inefficient class management. A consider- 
able portion of the recitation is taken up by distributing 
material, ruling papers, and preparing headings. Teachers 
often force children to sit idly by as they draw elaborate 
diagrams or write lists of figures on the blackboard. (2) 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
    326 ARITHMETIC 
The dictation of problems with unnecessary phrases is 
another practice that makes for waste in the recitation. 
(3) Time is often lavishly spent in working out examples 
containing wrong numbers and difficult combinations. 
(4) Time is wasted for some pupils because the work is not 
apportioned according to ability. To assign a set number 
of examples and hold all children responsible for the solu- 
tion of the same number of problems involves waste for 
the abler children. (5) A recitation without purpose or 
aim is a means of dissipating energy and wasting time. 
(6) Over-drill undoubtedly wastes as much time and pro- 
duces as much inefficiency as insufficient drill. (7) In- 
definiteness of assignment is a serious cause of time waste. 
(8) The attention of the entire class need not be directed 
to explanations needed by a minority of the class. (9) 
Failure to use short cuts means needless expenditure of 
time. For instance, instead of asking for the area to be 
paved if a space measures 54 ft. by 129 ft., the numbers 
should be changed to 54 ft. by 125 ft., so that the child 
may add three ciphers and divide by 8. (10) Another 
cause of waste in the recitation is the assignment of prob- 
lems that are outside the scope of practical business and 
home usage. 
The methods which Klapper suggests for eliminating this 
waste are given in his book which is listed at the end of the 
chapter. 
The Complexity of Simple Operations. We have a deep- 
grounded feeling that arithmetic is simple. But this feel- 
ing is erroneous. For instance, in such a supposedly 
simple thing as ordinary column addition Thorndike shows 
that there are seven different abilities that are needed in 
adding. These run as follows: (1) Learning to keep one’s 
place in the column as one adds. (2) Learning to keep in 
mind the result of each addition until the next number is
-P-A-G-E-343
THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 827 
added to it. (3) Learning to add a seen to a thought-of 
number. For instance, if the child has already added 
5 and 7 as he runs up the column he will have to carry 12 
in his mind (a thought-of number) while he adds the next 
figure, 6, a seen number, to it. (4) Learning to neglect an 
empty space in the columns. (5) Learning to neglect the 
zeros in the column. (6) The application of the combina- 
tions to the higher decades. For instance, a child may 
know that 8 plus 7 make 15, but may have considerable 
difficulty in knowing that 38 plus 7 make 45. (7) Learn- 
ing to write the figures signifying units rather than the 
total sum of the column. That is, if the first column totals 
45, his tendency is to write 45 at the bottom, when as a 
matter of fact he needs to put down the 5 and carry the 4. 
The significance of this analysis is quite clear. Every 
operation in arithmetic is constituted of many separate 
steps, and each step, except with very gifted children, has 
to be given individual attention. Arithmetic is made up 
of a great mass of specific elements, each of which has to 
be taught separately. Therefore, the successful teacher 
has to analyze the operations, see what the steps are, and 
teach them all. Some will be found to be more difficult 
than others, and these need to have special attention paid 
to them. 
Teaching the Processes. There are three facts of im- 
portance in teaching the processes of arithmetic. The first 
fact is that when children begin to study arithmetic they 
know a great deal about it in a concrete form but they 
have to learn to use symbols. For instance, if the pupil 
is given one apple and then another and asked how many 
he then has, he will probably be able to state that he has 
two; but for this he has to learn the symbols that express 
the abstract relationship involved — that is 1 + 1 = 2. 
To learn to think by symbols instead of by objects is a
-P-A-G-E-344
328 ARITHMETIC 
very long step for children to take. Therefore we begin 
the teaching of numbers by the use of objects, and objects 
should be used until the pupils can get along without 
them. Of course, an effort should be made to get them to 
do this as soon as possible, but they must not be hurried. 
Whenever a new process is to be taught, objects, diagrams, 
etc., that will make it easier to understand, should be used 
until the new work is mastered. Often a diagram will help 
an eighth-grade pupil to understand a problem, when, for 
a long time, he has been able to perform addition and multi- 
plication without objects. 
The second fact in teaching the processes is that where 
the process is too hard for the pupils to understand, but 
not too difficult for them to use, it should be given to them 
without explanation. If square root is taught in the eighth 
grade it is unwise to explain why we double the quotient 
and multiply by the new quotient, because that cannot be 
understood until the pupils have some knowledge of algebra. 
On the other hand, if the pupil can be easily taught the 
reason for the process it should not be taught to him 
mechanically. For instance, we may tell a pupil in teach- 
ing carrying in addition to put down the right-hand digit 
in the sum and carry the other digits to the next column to 
the left. But it is so easy to teach him the reasons for 
carrying, through the use of bundles of splints, that it is 
criminal not to do so. The third fact is that in teaching 
rules and principles, induction may frequently be used to 
good advantage. For instance in such a lesson as the addi- 
tion of fractions, after the children have learned to add 
fractions with the same denominators and are to be taught 
to add fractions with unlike denominators, the teacher, 
instead of telling the pupils how to do it might begin the 
lesson by giving them a few drills on 1/3 + 2/3, 3/4 + 2/4, 
etc. Then 1/3 + 1/5 may be put on the board and the
-P-A-G-E-345
THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 329 
children asked to add them. Since they cannot, the 
teacher may then say, “I shall put three problems on the 
board to show you how it is done, and you may work out 
the rule for me.” 
54+3   
1/3 +1/5 = 5/15 +3/15 = = 8/15 
1/4 + 1/3 = 3/12 + 4/12 = = 7/12 
1/5 + 1/6 = 6/30 + 5/30 = — = 11/30 
This presents three particular cases which the pupils 
compare. From the comparison they reach a generaliza- 
tion about what is done in all the cases. After they have 
discovered how it is done, the teacher may take up the 
reason underlying the process in order to insure the pupils’ 
getting something more than a mere mechanical knowledge 
of the rule. The inductive method can be used in very 
many cases in arithmetic; and when it is used the pupils 
take much more interest in the process than if they are 
merely told how the work is performed. 
Solving Problems. The form that this analysis takes is 
based upon psychology; that is, upon the way the mind 
acts in solving problems. A very simple statement of the 
mental actions involved in solving problems will make this 
clear. 
I remember that once I was given this problem to solve: 
A man sends $30,037.50 to a commission merchant to invest in 
wheat at 1/8 per cent commission. How many dollars’ worth of 
wheat is bought? 
I figured as follows: 
If the rate of commission is 1/8 per cent, then the amount of 
commission is 1/800 X $30,037.50, or $37. 54, and the amount 
invested is $29,999.96.
-P-A-G-E-346
330 ARITHMETIC 
But, on second thought, I found that, if this were in- 
vested at 1/8 per cent commission, the amount would be 
$37.49, which did not agree with the commission as worked 
out on the other basis. So I figured again, and after one 
or two other trials arrived at the idea that to invest $100 it 
was necessary to send $100.125, and hence the amount to 
be invested would be 
100 
100.125 
Then I checked up and found that $30,000 invested at 1/8 
per cent was $37.50. So I concluded that this answer was 
correct. 
Finally, when I knew it was correct, I wrote out a solu- 
tion in good form for the teacher as follows: 
$100.125 must be sent in order to invest $100. 
$30,037.50 must be sent in order to invest 
100 700.195 * $30,037.50 = $30,000. 
-". $30,000 must be invested. 
Check. $30,000 at 1/8 per cent commission = $30,000 X .125 = 
$37.50 
Amount sent = $30,037.50. Correct. X $30,037.50, or $30,000, making $37.50 
If we analyze what was done, we find the following 
factors: 
(1) I had to know what was to be found. In this case 
the amount invested. 
(2) I needed to know what data were given. These were 
$30,037.50 sent, commission 1/8 per cent. 
(3) I tried two plans of solution before I found the right 
one. 
(4) I checked to see if I was right after trying each plan. 
(5) I wrote out a systematic statement. 
This is what we always do when we have to work hard 
problems. Logic applies some technical terms to these
-P-A-G-E-347
THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 331 
factors which it is well for us to know. The logician would 
say that in solving a problem we need first, to define our 
problem; second, to find out the data; that is, what is 
given; third, to make several hypotheses (or guesses); 
fourth, to verify the hypotheses; and, fifth, to make a logical 
organization. 
For our purposes in arithmetic, more familiar terms may 
be used. And we may say that what we have to do are the 
following: 
(1) State what is to be found. 
(2) State what is given. 
(3) Work out a solution. 
(4) Check. 
(5) Make a systematic statement. 
These five steps will take care of the analysis of any 
problem. Take, for instance, a problem like this: 
If milk is 28 per cent cream, and the cream is 35 per cent butter 
fat, and the butter fat will make 14 times its own weight in butter, 
how many pounds of butter can you get from 100 lbs. of milk? 
If we analyze it, we may make the statement as follows: 
(1) To find: Amount of butter from 100 Ibs. of milk. 
(2) Given: Milk is 28 per cent cream, cream is 35 per 
cent butter fat, 1 lb. butter fat makes 1} Ibs. butter. 
Given also: 100 lbs. milk. 
(3) Working out a solution. 
(4) Check. 
(5) Systematic statement: 
100 Ibs. milk = .28 X 100 Ibs. cream = 28 lbs. 
28 Ibs. cream = .35 X 28 lbs. butter fat = 9.8 Ibs. 
9.8 Ibs. butter fat = 9.8 x 9/8 lb. butter = 11.025 lbs. butter. 
Check: 11.025 x 8/9 X 100/35 X 100/28 = 100. 
In connection with this I wish to make a few remarks. 
First. The statement that pupils make of a solution 
should be written neatly enough to be easily read. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
332 ARITHMETIC 
teacher and pupils should decide on what they think are 
the best forms for statements, and the pupils should there- 
after adhere pretty closely to these. But — and this is 
very important —a pupil should not be scored heavily if 
he is not successful in making a statement, provided he gets 
the answer. Many teachers lay so much stress on state- 
ments that children come to hate arithmetic. The answer 
is the important thing in ninety-nine cases out of a hun- 
dred; the other case is the occasional chance that a pupil 
has hit upon the answer by accident and does not under- 
stand how he found it. Statements should be insisted 
upon, I think, only in seat work, and in other cases where 
the teacher is in doubt about the pupil’s ability to solve 
the problem. 
There is no best statement. Any one of a number will 
do, and children coming from other schools may have 
different ways of expressing their solutions. At such times 
the teacher should go slowly and patiently in teaching 
them the forms current in their new surroundings. State- 
ments should not be cumbersome. Each step in the solu- 
tion of a problem should be as brief as possible, and I 
should be willing to accept the following statement for the 
milk problem as correct and sufficient: 
100 _X .35_X 28 X 9 _ 44.095 Ibs. 
8 
It shows the teacher that the pupil knew what to do and 
did it. : 
Second. The directions for solving a problem need not 
be written out by the pupils in every problem. It is cum- 
bersome, but pupils should probably be taught to follow 
that plan. That is, they should be taught, first, to look 
for what is to be found; second, to find the data, ete. When 
these directions about solutions are being taught, they 
   
-P-A-G-E-349
THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 333 
should, occasionally, be written in order to help the memory 
until they can be repeated by heart; but after that it is 
sufficient if the pupils are able to give a statement of the 
steps from memory when called for. 
Third. The third step, that of guessing, is a good thing 
for the pupils. (By guessing is meant an intelligent guess, 
not a wild guess.) They should not be shown at once how 
to get the right solution; but, rather, they should be given 
time to work the problem for themselves. However, chil- 
dren in country schools have to do more of their work for 
themselves than do children in city schools where the 
teacher has more time to spend on them. That fact ex- 
plains why country pupils who are good students are more 
independent in their thinking, and more self-reliant than 
are city school children. They are compelled to work 
things out for themselves, trying over and over again till 
they get the right solution. 
Summary. There are five steps in solving a problem in arith- 
metic. These are: (1) determining what is to be found; (2) stating 
what is given; (3) working out a solution; (4) checking; and (5) 
making a final statement. The statement is not always essential 
and should not be allowed to kill interest.) The pupils should be 
given a chance to work a problem for themselves before being 
shown how; and, in working their problems, they should use a 
systematic procedure, such as the five steps above, because that 
has been found to be the natural way for the mind to act when 
working most effectively. 
Thorndike, in the reference listed at the end of the 
chapter, gives a number of illustrated lessons in the use 
of inductive and deductive reasoning, from which I shall 
quote one on short multiplication without carrying. 
InvuctiveE ExpLaNATION 
1. The children of the third grade are to have a picnic. 32 are 
going. How many sandwiches will they need if each of the 
82 children has four sandwiches?

Here is a quick way to find out: 
82 Think “4 x 2,” write 8 under the 2 in the ones column. 
4 Think ‘4 x 8,” write 12 under the 3 in the tens column. 
2. How many bananas will they need if each of the 32 children 
has two bananas? 
82 X 2 or 2 X 32 will give the answer. 
8. How many little cakes will they need if each child has three 
cakes? 
82 X 83 or 8 X 32 will give the answer.

Summary. In teaching the processes, three things need to be 
borne in mind. These are: (1) Pupils have to learn (slowly) how 
to use symbols instead of objects; (2) in teaching the processes 
the reasons for them may be given where they are not difficult, 
but the teacher should not hesitate to teach the process mechani- 
cally when the explanation is too difficult; (3) the inductive method 
should be used as much as practicable. 
Points to Stress. Thorndike has mentioned a list of 
difficult points which the teacher is inclined to neglect, but 
which should, as a matter of fact, be strongly emphasized. 
(1) Numbers should be taught not only in connection with 
objects but in connection with length, volume, and weight. 
He says that lines should be labeled “‘1 foot,” “2 feet,” 
“1 inch,” “2 inches,” and so on; that weights should be 
lifted and called “1 pound,” “2 pounds,” and so on, and 
that things should be measured in glassfuls, handfuls, 
pints, and so on. Numbers should not all be taught in 
connection with separate objects like apples, blocks, and 
so on. 
(2) Additions in the higher decades should be empha-  
-P-A-G-E-351
  THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 335 
sized. Stress should not be laid merely upon 6 + 7 = 13, 
but on 16 + 7, 26 + 7, etc. 
(3) With reference to uneven divisions, the quotients 
with remainders for the divisions of every number to 
19 by 2, 29 by 3, every number to 39 X 4, and so on, should 
be taught as well as the even divisions. He suggests a 
table like this: 
10 = - 28 
10=.... 8sand. rem. 
10 = 4s and rem, 
10'S) 5 2. abs * KK 
ee ee 
Soe ge 
80°] 2). 8s and..:. : rem, 
(4) The equation form should be stressed. This is done 
to get the pupils familiar with the equation long before 
they reach algebra. Children may be asked to write the 
missing numbers: 
Gp Sie ss Spee ag 
+. eS = 1d - sae = BEES 
(5) Addition and subtraction facts in the case of frac- 
tions should not be overlooked. Children should get into 
the habit of seeing halves and thirds in terms of sixths, 
thirds and fourths in terms of twelfths, and fourths and 
eighths in terms of eights, and so on. 
(6) Certain protective habits should be built up. In 
multiplying and dividing with fractions children should be 
taught clearly so that they will remember in connection 
with multiplying by a fraction the following three facts: 
(1) When you multiply a number by anything more than 
“1” the result is larger than the number. (2) When you 
multiply a number by “1” the result is the same as the 
number. (3) When you multiply a number by anything
-P-A-G-E-352
    336 ARITHMETIC 
less than “1” the result is always smaller than the number. 
In dividing by a fraction children should learn the rules by 
drill, and have them exemplified in practice, that when 
you divide a number by anything more than “1” the result 
is smaller than the number; when you divide a number by 
“1” the result is the same as the number; and when you 
divide a number by anything less than “1” the result is 
larger than the number. 
(7) That “per cent of” means “hundredths times,” 
should be stressed. In case of percentage examples like the 
following should be given: 
5 per cent of = .05 times 
20 per cent of = .20 times 
6 per cent of = .06 times 
25 per cent of = .25 X 
12 per cent of = .12 X 
8 per cent of = .03 X 
(8) Habits of verifying results should be formed. Chil- 
dren should make it a matter of routine, carried on with 
every problem, to check the answer by going over it again, 
or by some other way before they leave it as finished. 
Drill. To work problems is the final goal of arithmetic. 
But no pupil will have much success or happiness in this 
task unless he knows the fundamental operations so well 
that he can perform them rapidly and accurately. If, in 
the problem above he makes mistakes in multiplying 
.35 by 28, and finds everything coming out wrong, he will 
grow discouraged and distrustful of himself. To get accu- 
racy and rapidity we need drill. As we have seen, what is 
needed is (1) a clear initial understanding. The pupils 
must know the facts of addition, subtraction, and so on, to 
begin with. Care must be taken to see that each is taught 
clearly, then (2) follows attentive repetition (3) carried on 
in a happy mood. Children must have exercises of various
-P-A-G-E-353
  THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 337 
sorts that develop speed and accuracy. Every time the 
teacher finds the pupils making errors in their problems he 
should make occasion to point out the fact and introduce 
drill. 
Practice drill periods should be from ten to fifteen minutes 
long. The pupils should, according to Monroe, work for 
speed rather than accuracy, because he states that accu- 
racy tends to follow along with speed. Drill work is most 
successful when carried on under pressure. Children should 
try to solve as many problems as possible in a certain time. 
In oral work the teacher gives the problems as rapidly as 
practicable; multiplication tables may be taught in a bunch 
rather than spread over two or three years, but care must 
be taken to see that the pressure is not too great for the 
class. 
One of the best means of drill is mental arithmetic. 
Five minutes spent upon oral arithmetic at the beginning 
of a period is an excellent tonic, and actually saves time 
during the rest of the recitation. Mental drill should be 
conducted slowly enough so that at least three fourths of 
the pupils can give the correct answer. Speed should, 
however, be increased as the class improves and occa- 
‘ sional bursts of speed should be indulged in for the sake 
of the brightest pupils. One of the best means for stimu- 
lating the pupils’ interest in drill is to give them tests for 
speed, such as the Courtis tests or home-made tests. The 
results, as has been said before, should be recorded and 
graphed so that the pupil may be able to see that on March 
seventh he had a score of 64 in speed and on April first 
had a score of 67. When he sees this he will try to beat his 
record by April fifteenth. 
Then there are many devices to be used in class, such as 
memorizing tables, multiplying the numbers on the dial of 
a clock by various multipliers, and soon. These and others
-P-A-G-E-354
    338 ARITHMETIC 
of a similar sort are mentioned in references at the end of 
the chapter. 
Emphasis must be laid upon the fact that drill work 
must be snappy and speedy. Some teachers cannot be 
good teachers of arithmetic because they have none of that 
good old household remedy “ginger” in their make-up. 
A class will be just as spirited as the teacher and no more. 
If the football coach does not put snap into the team he is 
beaten and he may lose his job, but if the teacher does not 
put snap into his arithmetic no one knows about it. He 
is able to cover up his slovenliness. It would be better for 
him if he were in the limelight as is the football coach. 
Emphasis must also be laid upon the fact that drill in 
arithmetic is useless unless it is carried beyond the point 
where the child can perform the operations of arithmetic 
automatically. A little drill is of no use. It must go all 
the way or be futile. When a boy has learned his opera- 
tions so well that he can add a column of figures correctly 
while thinking about a piece of watermelon he has reached 
perfection —for he has reached the goal of all habit — to 
perform an action while thinking about something else. 
Summary. Drill is of prime importance in arithmetic. After 
an operation is understood it should receive snappy drill at fre- 
quent intervals until it becomes automatic. 
Practice Tests. Several sets of practice tests have been 
devised for drill in the fundamental operations. These 
agree in giving sets of exercises which involve all the com- 
binations in each of the four fundamental operations and 
require the students to get each exercise correct within a 
given standard of time before going on with the next ex- 
ercise. The results of this work, especially in Grades IV, 
V, and VI, are quite striking. For instance, in Boston, 
Ballou found that by using the Courtis Practice Tests for 
a year and a half in thirty-five school districts, the fourth
-P-A-G-E-355
  THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 339 
grade grew as much in speed as was ordinarily accom- 
plished in two years, and in accuracy as much as in four 
years. Melcher in Kansas City found that with twenty- 
two days’ work with failing pupils in the summer, using the 
Courtis tests each day, there was an increase of from one 
half to two years in skill. 
The Courtis Practice Tests may be obtained from i 
World Book Co., Yonkers, New York. The Studebaker 
Practice Tests may be obtained from Scott, Foresman & 
Co., Chicago. The Studebaker tests have an edition pre- 
pared for rural schools. 
Application. To work life problems is, as we have said, 
the goal of arithmetic instruction. These problems may 
come from three sources— the teacher, the~ textbook, 
and the pupils. The problems should be practical. There 
is no use in teaching processes that do not have practical 
applications. So, if the text used in the schools does not 
contain many practical problems the teacher must secure 
other texts which have them and in addition make up 
problems of his own. Criticism is constantly made that 
pupils may know arithmetic, but that they are unable to 
cast up an account, to write a receipt, draw a note, write 
a check, compute interest, measure a field and tell how 
many acres are in it, estimate the amount of money neces- 
sary to build a henhouse, or determine the number of 
bushels in a bin or corncrib; nor can we deny the accusation. 
To cure this defect the teacher should study the home 
life of the pupils, and make a list of the things in connec- 
tion with which their fathers and mothers use arithmetic 
in their everyday lives. This list should be kept on file 
and from time to time as the occasion arises in school, these 
items should be introduced as practical applications of 
what is being taught in the arithmetic class. 
Pupils should be encouraged to bring in practical
-P-A-G-E-356
  340 ARITHMETIC 
problems for the class to work upon. What is more in- 
teresting than for John, when his father is going to build 
a cattle shed, to get the dimensions, etc., from him and 
have the class work out the cost of the lumber. John may 
not bring all the data to school the first time he tries, but 
when he finds that the class cannot work his problem be- 
cause he has forgotten something, he will receive a valuable 
lesson in carefulness and will take pains to get the proper 
statements the next time. If none of the pupils of their 
own initiative bring problems, the teacher, when he hears 
of the construction of a building or the selling of cattle, as 
he will in a country community, should embrace this op- 
portunity of getting life materials for arithmetic and ask 
some boy or girl to get the data for him. 
Summary. To solve problems, and especially practical problems 
is the final goal of all arithmetic study. The teacher, therefore, 
should see that the pupils are given this type of problem and 
should avoid the unreal and imaginary problems which are fre- 
quently constructed by textbook writers for the sole purpose of 
giving exercises in arithmetical operations. Pupils likewise 
should be encouraged to bring practical problems to the school. 
Tables. The critical point in the mastery of the four 
fundamental operations — addition, subtraction, multi- 
plication, and division —is the learning of the tables. 
For, although a pupil may be able to recite the tables 
glibly and still make many errors in carrying on the opera- 
tions in problems and exercises, he wastes time and loses 
accuracy if he does not know them glibly. 
The chief advantages of knowing the tables automatically 
are two. In the first place the tables give a rhythmical 
drill. There is such a fascinating swing to them that chil- 
dren who are learning them often repeat them for the fun 
of the jingle, just as they repeat nursery rhymes for the 
rhythm. Yet from this singsong repetition there is much 
good; for the child is saying over and over to himself
-P-A-G-E-357
  THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC 341 
6 X 7 = 42, all the time fixing the facts and working 
toward that goal which is attained when 6 X 7 automati- 
cally suggests 42. The second advantage of well-memorized 
tables is the hold it gives on individual facts. For instance, 
Willie may have trouble in remembering whether 8 X 7 = 
54 or 56. But he always remembers, let us say,8 X 5 = 40. 
So by starting at 8 X 5 = 40, he can get into swing of the 
table; and when he gets to 8 X 7 he at once remembers 
that, of course, it is 56. 
Eight seconds is a reasonable time to take in repeating 
a table. This requires that they should be memorized 
until the pupils are able to repeat them without halting. 
It takes just a little more practice to raise halting tables 
to glib tables, but that little makes or mars their useful- 
ness, for halting tables are of no more use than no tables. 
. Tables should be memorized in three ways: forward, 
backward, and by “skips.” The first and second can be 
done by the pupil himself. By skipping is meant taking 
the facts out of their order in the tables; for instance, 
instead of saying, 8 X 1 = 8, 8 X 2 = 16, etc., the order 
may run:8 X5=?8X9=?8X2=?Petc. This comes 
in exercises such as 8467 X 8 or in special drill exercises 
given by the teacher as in the clock-face exercise. The 
aim of the drill upon tables is to make the pupil proficient 
in skipping; because in problems, only once in a great while 
do we get a problem as nearly like the table as 1234 X 8. 
_ Summary. Tables should be memorized thoroughly backward, 
forward,and by skipping. They should be learned for all the 
operations, because they provide rhythmical drill and assist the 
pupil when he forgets individual facts. But to be of any use they 
should be memorized so thoroughly that they can be recited with- 
out halting and with the glibness of “eenie — meenie — minie 
— mo.” 
Assignments. Assignments are easier to make in arith- 
metic than in history or literature. For, as we saw in
-P-A-G-E-358
  842 ARITHMETIC 
those subjects, the teacher often has to make out assign- 
ment problems, but in arithmetic the problems are already 
made out. 
But this one fact must be emphasized. Children should 
not be expected to learn new operations from the text- 
book. These should always be developed in class. A 
teacher may, for instance, give as an assignment a chapter 
on addition of fractions which has not been studied before, 
and expect the children not only to add fractions, but to 
learn the operations for themselves. This is wrong. Ad- 
dition of fractions should be assigned after it has been 
learned in class. 
In history the new assignment cannot always be read 
in class, and pupils may work upon it for themselves in 
preparation for the next recitation. But history is easy, 
while arithmetic is hard; so the teacher must help the 
pupils to understand the arithmetic by taking it up in the 
recitation period before they work any problems in it by . 
themselves. Klapper presents eight excellent rules for 
the guidance of teachers in the assignment of home work 
in arithmetic. (1) He says that the home work must be 
supplementary to the school work and the application of 
what is taught in school. (2) It must also be assigned with 
careful attention to time. Children should not be given 
lessons that are too long. (3) Home work must be as- 
signed with careful attention to the difficulties involved. 
Very difficult material should be taught in school rather 
than studied at home. (4) Home work must be corrected 
in class by the teacher or by the pupils. Uncorrected home 
work will not be done. (5) Home work should be kept in 
notebooks. The aim is to have an accumulative result 
which will show the pupil at a glance his proficiency from 
day to day. (6) The pupil must be assured of a favorable

teacher sometimes will have to educate the parents on this 
matter. The average mother is glad to help if she knows 
what todo. (7) All pupils should not have the same home 
work assigned. Some children are not in need of so much 
drill as others. In other cases bright children can be given 
more home work than the slow. (8) Not all home work 
need be written. For instance, if tables are assigned for 
home study it is not necessary to require all the children to 
write these tables a certain number of times.

CHAPTER XIII 
HEALTH EDUCATION 
1. Subject-Matter 
Function. Health education as studied in the grades con- 
sists of anatomy, physiology, hygiene, and physical exer- 
cise. By anatomy is meant the structure of the organs of 
the body; by physiology is meant the function of the organs, 
and by hygiene is meant their care. For instance, in the 
study of the teeth, there are three things to be considered : 
the structure of the teeth — root, neck, and crown; den- 
tine, cement, enamel, and pulp (anatomy); the function of 
the teeth — mastication (physiology); and methods of pre- 
venting decay (hygiene). When I was a boy school phys- 
iology consisted chiefly of anatomy; that is, of the study of 
the different parts of the body. We learned the names of 
all the bones, of the structure of the heart, lungs, digestive 
organs, ete. Only slight attention was paid to the func- 
tion of these organs. We did learn that the function of the 
heart was to pump blood through the system and the func- 
tion of the lungs was to remove impurities from the blood 
and purify it with oxygen, but comparatively little time 
was spent on this. The evil effects of alcohol, however, 
were graphically depicted. 
To-day the emphasis is wisely changed. The most im- 
portant function of the study of physiology in the grades 
is to teach us how to take care of the body. If rules of 
hygiene are learned so thoroughly that they will be applied 
in practice, we may consider the subject to be well taught. 
No matter how much anatomy or physiology is studied in
-P-A-G-E-362
346 HEALTH EDUCATION 
school it is of little worth if resulting from this study there 
does not follow the practice of the rules of hygiene. It is 
interesting to know how teeth perform their functions and 
what constitute the different parts of a tooth, but this is 
not of sufficient importance to be taught unless it forms a 
basis for rules about cleaning and caring for the teeth, and 
the forming of habits to carry the rules. 
We study anatomy to explain the rules of hygiene. For 
instance, one rule of hygiene is “Clean the teeth.” This 
rule may be followed by the children without question, 
merely because parents and teachers insist upon it, but 
children are more likely to follow the rule if they know why 
they ought to clean their teeth. This anatomy explains in 
part as follows. The crown of the teeth is composed of 
three layers — enamel, dentine, and pulp. In the pulp is 
situated the nerve. In the mouth are bacteria which, 
unless removed, will eat through the enamel and dentine, 
thus exposing the pulp and nerve. Therefore the teeth 
should be cleaned after each meal to get rid of decayable 
food which harbors these bacteria. 
It follows from this that no more anatomy should be 
taught than suffices to explain the rules of hygiene. The 
human body is an organism so complex that its structure 
is not fully understood even by doctors, and in school 
physiology much more is frequently presented than can be 
understood by the children. If, therefore, we teach only 
enough to give the reasons for rules of hygiene we may 
safely and wisely omit some material which is now given in 
most school physiologies. 
Summary. In the study of health education in the grades the 
end to be attained is a knowledge of, and practice in, the rules of 
hygiene. The study of the anatomy of the body should be made 
in sufficient detail to explain these rules, if they are easily ex- 
plainable and no parts of the body whose connections with these 
rules cannot be seen by the pupils need be studied.
-P-A-G-E-363
  SUBJECT-MATTER 347 
Rural Health. It has long been a popular tradition that 
health conditions are better in the country than in the city, 
but within recent years this has been proved to be a fallacy. 
For instance, the death rate of New York City is lower 
than that of the state of New York outside of New York 
City, and the statistics of the first draft showed no su- 
periority on the part of the men from rural communities. 
When we stop to consider the matter we can easily see that 
though rural people have plenty of fresh air and exercise 
they have certain handicaps. Housing conditions are fre- 
quently bad. Rural people are not so well acquainted 
with the rules of hygiene as city people. The rural school- 
houses are often in deplorable condition, while in the city 
schools the health is unusually well taken care of. The 
most serious of these defects is the lack of knowledge of 
hygiene, coupled with the difficulty of securing medical 
attention. Fortunately the rural schools are in a position 
to remedy this defect by methods to be described in the 
succeeding pages. 
Ideals. Three ideals are of importance in the giving of 
health education. The first of these is the ideal of health- 
fulness. Children should be interested in health and should 
be in love with healthfulness as something to be worked 
for. The second ideal is persistence in the care of health. 
It is not sufficient for the children to have information. 
They need to apply the rules of hygiene persistently, not only 
when they are sick but as a preventive when they are well. 
Third, is the wnderstanding of the human body as it bears 
upon preservation of health. They should set up as their 
aim the gaining of concrete and definite knowledge about 
the structure of the body and the function of its organs. 
This is much more important than spelling or handwriting. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. There are four objectives 
which a teacher should bear in mind in the teaching of
-P-A-G-E-364
348 HEALTH EDUCATION 
healthfulness. The first objective is to develop in the chil- 
dren a love for the care of health, including play; the second 
thing that should result from the study of health for four 
years is proper health habits. The children should have 
habits which do not lapse. They should clean the teeth 
every day. They should never allow flies to enter the 
house. They should always sterilize the milk cans, ete. 
Third, besides having regular habits where it is necessary 
to form these, they should learn how to apply the informa- 
tion about hygiene to the control of diseases. Not only 
should they know that colds are infectious, but they should 
apply this knowledge by avoiding contact with other 
people if they have acold. In the fourth place, the graduate 
of the eighth grade should have enough knowledge of the 
physiology and anatomy of his body to understand why 
the rules of hygiene are effective. With a love for good 
health, an understanding of the physiology and hygiene 
involved, and a direct application of this in the form of 
good health habits and control of disease, the school will 
have performed a task of inestimable value for its graduates 
and the community. i 
Diagnosis. It will be remembered that in the chapter on 
spelling we were able to present lists of the most common 
spelling difficulties and stress was laid upon the fact that 
in teaching spelling it was necessary to diagnose the diffi- 
culties in order to find out exactly what should be taught. 
The same procedure holds true in all subjects of the cur- 
riculum, and in none more than in health education. 
While the diagnosis of diseases is a matter for the doctor, 
it is nevertheless possible for the teacher to discern much 
about the physical difficulties of the children. Any teacher 
knows the most common and easily communicable diseases 
and is able to give standard tests for eyesight and hearing, 
but in addition to this it is possible for the teacher to make
-P-A-G-E-365
  SUBJECT-MATTER 349 
a health survey of each school child. Hoag has a card, 
containing twenty-five questions, which when answered by 
the child will give the teacher a good deal of information 
about him. This will be found in the book by Andress 
listed at the end of the chapter. After doing this or with- 
out doing it, the teacher can detect the presence of com- 
municable diseases in the schoolroom and can learn from 
the children, the doctor, and the nurse the other sorts of 
infectious diseases in the neighborhood. When these 
diseases occur they can be made the subject of study in 
the school. A very good illustration of such a study is 
given by Collings. The teacher in the rural school heard 
of the occurrence of a case of typhoid in one of the homes of 
the community and used it as the topic for a series of lessons 
on the causes of typhoid, with the result in this case that 
the children prepared a report for the owner of the house 
who, interestingly enough, followed their suggestions. 
Securing occasions for the teaching of hygiene is not a 
matter of finding the occasions; rather is it a matter of 
selecting from so many that the full time of the school 
might be spent in teaching physiology and hygiene 
alone. 
Course of Study. The facts of health education may be 
taught both incidentally and systematically. Clearly they 
can be taught incidentally every day in the year in con- 
nection with schoolroom ventilation, eyesight, and many 
other opportunities for giving personal advice that come 
up daily in the school. When colds occur methods of cure 
should be discussed with all the school. Measles, whooping 
cough and mumps, as they annually recur, should likewise 
be the basis for instruction upon the facts secured from the 
doctor or from reliable books. 
In addition, in the seventh and eighth grades, the sub- 
ject should be taught systematically and should alternate
-P-A-G-E-366
z ? 
350 HEALTH EDUCATION 
by years. In this systematic study the adopted text and 
supplementary books and bulletins should be used by both 
the teacher and the pupils and at every point the topics 
should be closely and interestingly connected with vital 
needs in the pupils’ experience. 
What should be taught throughout the grades is difficult 
to state with definiteness because much of the content de- 
pends upon the health needs of the community. Andress 
gives twenty-five desirable health habits which should be 
taught and twenty-nine others that should be discouraged. 
These run as follows: 
Desirable health habits. (1) Cleanliness of body, especially of 
the hands, and cleanliness in the schoolhouse and on the school 
grounds; (2) cleaning the teeth; (3) ventilating the schoolroom; 
(4) correct sitting and standing postures; (5) proper breathing; 
(6) cleaning shoes before entering the schoolroom; (7) correct use 
of the voice; (8) right use of the eyes; (9) care of hair and nails; 
(10) use of individual drinking-cups, pencils, and other materials; 
(11) dusting school furniture; (12) proper cleaning of blackboards; 
(18) use of the handkerchief; (14) proper mastication of food; 
(15) eating only enough to satisfy the appetite; (16) cheerfulness 
at mealtime; (17) movement of the bowels once a day; (18) wash- 
ing hands after going to the toilet; (19) exercise in the open air 
daily; (20) self-control; (21) sufficient sleep; (22) bandaging for 
ordinary emergencies; (23) properly cooking a few ordinary foods; 
(24) care in crossing the street in front of teams and automobiles; 
(25) care of milk and other foods. 
Bad habits to be discouraged. (1) Putting anything into the 
mouth except food; (2) expectorating on the floor or sidewalk; 
(8) biting nails; (4) thumb-sucking; (5) “swapping” gum, food, 
etc.; (6) coughing in another’s face; (7) kissing on the lips; (8) car- 
rying soiled handkerchiefs; (9) picking the nose; (10) rubbing the 
eyes; (11) reading in a dim light; (12) putting foreign bodies in the 
ear; (18) cracking nuts with the teeth; (14) licking the fingers in 
turning the pages of a book; (15) overeating; (16) eating when 
tired; (17) using another person’s brush, comb, towel, or drinking- 
cup; (18) wearing wet clothing; (19) bandaging a cut with a soiled 
rag; (20) wearing shoes that are ill-fitting; (21) negligence in 
bathing regularly; (22) not exercising daily in the open air; 
(23) neglecting a daily evacuation of the bowels; (24) not wash- 
ing hands after going to toilet; (25) drinking an insufficient amount
-P-A-G-E-367
INTEREST Ee 351 ad 
of water; (26) grouchiness; (27) insufficient amount of sleep; 
(28) bad sitting and standing postures; (29) eating too fast. 
He also quotes from Dr. Fisher fifteen rules of health 
which, if properly observed, will, in the opinion of Dr. 
Fisher, make for health and long life. 
Air: 
1. Have fresh air where you live and work. 
2. Wear light, loose clothes. 
3. Spend part of your time in the open air. 
4. Have lots of fresh air where you sleep. 
5. Breathe deeply. 
Food: 
6. Avoid eating too much. 
7. Do not eat much meat and eggs. 
8., Eat various kinds of food. 
9. Eat slowly. 
Habits: 
10. Have your bowels move every day. 
11. Stand, sit, and walk erect. 
12. Avoid poisonous drugs. 
13. Keep away from catching diseases. 
Activity: 
14. Work hard, but play and rest too. 
15. Be cheerful and learn not to worry. 
The foregoing are important health habits and to these 
is added in the course of study the material in the text- 
book and such other information as is necessary to contro 
the diseases of the community and the health of the in- 
dividual. 
2. Interest 
It is a quite interesting fact that the desire to preserve 
one’s health is not a strong motive with children. Such 
an incentive does not begin to appear until one begins to 
grow older and has had some sickness or has reached middle 
life and begins to see that it is necessary for him to take 
better care of his body. But to children, with their abound- 
ing vitality, immediate interest in health is not particu-, 
larly keen.
-P-A-G-E-368
352 HEALTH EDUCATION 
Consequently we have to look for certain types of mediate 
interest, and of these there are several. First among these 
are such generic incentives as a desire to be thought well of 
by the teacher. In addition to this, marks may be given 
for health practice as in other subjects. If grades are used, 
it is particularly important that the children be given 
grades for the forming of hygiene habits such as cleaning 
the teeth, keeping a correct posture, etc. Competition is 
frequently a strong incentive. The class may be divided 
into clubs or groups who compete with each other. Groups 
such as Yale and Harvard, or Chicago and Michigan, which 
compete with each other may be made up. National or- 
ganizations, such as the Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, 
who give badges, have had a tremendous influence upon the 
building up of right habits. The desire to be strong some- 
times keeps young boys from forming the cigarette habit. 
The codperation of parents has an important place in 
the developing of interest. Many of the health habits 
such as correct posture and care of the eyes are matters 
which must be practiced at home as well as in school. So 
much is this the case that the codperation of parents is 
absolutely essential for the formation of correct habits 
while at the same time it helps to keep the children in- 
terested in their work. 
Particularly important is the keeipiis of records. The 
teacher can make a record of the sitting posture, in the 
schoolroom for instance, just as well as he can give grades 
for history and geography. In this matter the good faithand 
sportsmanship of the student is a factor. He can easily 
misstate the facts, but when the matter is put before him as 
a gentleman there is usually little difficulty in this respect. 
It will thus be seen that interest in correct habits is 
difficult to obtain and all sorts of incentives must be ap- 
pealed to if they are to be formed.
-P-A-G-E-369
METHODS OF TEACHING 353 
3. Methods of Teaching 
Obviously the content of the course of study deals with 
two things of prime importance. One of these is devoted 
to the facts which it is necessary to learn and the other to 
the habits which it is necessary to set up. 
Drill. That the habit is a difficult thing to form is shown 
clearly in the following quotation from Andress, who gives 
the diary of a pupil who spent twenty-five days in building 
up the habit of learning to brush her teeth five times a 
day. Brushing the teeth five times a day is a heroic task, 
but this is how it was accomplished: 
On November 20, 1916, I decided to form the habit of brushing 
my teeth five times per day. I selected this habit because of the 
serious condition of my teeth. I decided to carry on the operation 
as follows: 
1. Before breakfast. 
2. After breakfast. 
8. After lunch. 
4. After dinner. 
5. Before going to bed. 
I began my practice November 21, 1916. 
Nov. 21. I carried out my practice very successfully, not hav- 
ing one error. This was probably due to the fact that the habit 
was fresh in memory. 
Nov. 22. I had two errors due to forgetfulness. 
Nov. 23. There were four errors. Practice was omitted every 
time except in the morning. It seemed as if I was slowly climb- 
ing the ladder of errors instead of successes. 
Nov. 24. I determined on this day to omit no practice, but 
contrary to my ‘determination I discovered at the close of the 
day I had made one error. This was due to the fact that I had 
attended a theater party and was very tired when I returned. 
Nov. 25. To my regret, on Nov. 25 I omitted the practice en- 
tirely. I arose at a Jate hour in the morning, and in my hurry I 
forgot the habit, but why I neglected it the rest of the day I am 
unable to explain. 
Noy. 26.. I found it was very hard to return again to the habit, 
and it was at this time I realized the value of the caution, “Allow 
no exceptions to occur.” I struggled through the day with four 
errors. 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
354 HEALTH EDUCATION 
Nov. 27. This day I gradually climbed the ladder to success. 
There was only one error. 
Nov. 28. This was certainly a banner day for me — no errors. 
Noy. 29. As good as my record was for the previous day, my 
record to-day was bad, for I neglected all practice. 
Nov. 30. It seemed as if the Thanksgiving spirit had banished 
all idea of practice, for I had five more errors to add to my list. 
Dec. 1. I returned from vacation with a renewed determina- 
tion to practice faithfully; nevertheless I had three more errors at 
the close of the day. 
Dec. 2. Two errors — after lunch and dinner. 
Dec. 3. I was ill on this day and practiced the habit only once. 
Dec. 4. Two errors. 
Dee. 5. Only one error, but it seemed as if I could never again 
reach the point of zero. 
Dec. 6. My desire was gratified. No errors. 
Dec. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 14. On these days I practiced five 
times per day. I presume the habit is formed. It took three and 
a half weeks. 
In the formation of habits an important essential is the 
securing of happiness. The chief trouble with those who 
do not get sufficient’ physical exercise is the fact that they 
do not like it. If they actually enjoyed the sensations that 
accompany a walk, or the feeling of exhilaration at taking 
their “daily dozen,” they would look forward to doing 
them instead of making excuses for not taking the exer- 
cises or willfully neglecting to do them. ‘This fact has not 
been fully recognized by those who try to set up new habits. 
Any habit which has to work against the interest and pleas- 
ure of the performer is doomed to failure. Consequently 
the teacher must help the children to feel elation and en- 
thusiasm in the formation of their habits: The second 
important fact is that they must have a clear idea of what 
is to be done and they should be taught exactly how to 
perform the operations. If they are to take the correct 
standing posture the teacher must see that it is correct. 
Then they must repeat the action until it has become 
automatic. These simple rules for habit formation are
-P-A-G-E-371
METHODS OF TEACHING 355 
easy to state but difficult to carry out, and the teacher 
must introduce all the incentives which we have mentioned 
and others which he can invent to keep the habit in opera- 
tion. 
The foregoing remarks have dealt with the setting up of 
health habits. A word or two is necessary upon the memo- 
rizing of terms. When the teacher has decided what parts 
of human anatomy he will teach the words should be 
memorized by the pupils. If, for instance, heart, arteries, 
veins, ventricle, and auricle are to be taught, they should 
be drilled upon thoroughly. The pupils should be expected 
to be able both to spell and pronounce them glibly. The 
rules for this have been discussed over and over again. 
Particularly should there be attentive repetition until the 
terms have become automatic. If the pupils learn the 
words thoroughly they will be able to read health bulletins 
with intelligence all their lives (and it is becoming more 
and more necessary for people to be able to do this) but 
if the terms used are a jumble of indefiniteness to them 
they will form a distaste for all reading material upon the 
subject. 
Clearness. A little boy on an examination was asked to 
name the parts of the body, whereupon he delivered him- 
self of this astounding statement: ‘The human body con- 
sists of the head, chest, and stomach. The head contains 
the brains, if any. The chest holds the lungs, liver, and 
lights. The stomach consists of the bowels — a, e, i, 0, u, 
and sometimes w and y.” Andress quotes some students 
as giving the following answers on an examination: “The 
diaphragm is another word for backbone.” “The pericar- 
dium is something that will put you to sleep.” Another 
eighth-grade pupil varies the meaning of “diaphragm” by 
stating that it is very delicate and that it is located in the 
head. He is matched by a second who says that the bones 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  356 HEALTH EDUCATION 
are made up of hard mucous membrane, while a third adds 
that the nervous system is a kind of tube “where the blood 
vessels are in.” 
Clearly such students are the victims of poor teaching, 
for the teacher has evidently not made a successful attempt 
to give them a clear picture of the anatomy of the human 
body. This is not a difficult thing to do if the teacher uses 
pictures, and especially if he spends time enough upon the 
“geography” of the organs to enable the pupils to locate 
the different organs and parts of organs. Some schools 
have models of the human body, though these are expen- 
sive. Others have colored physiology charts. Other 
teachers, where the plan is practicable, secure the organs 
of pigs, chickens, and beeves. All of this illustrative 
material is good and should be used as far as possible, but 
even with nothing but the pictures in the text the teacher 
can teach the anatomy of the body if he will treat it as a 
geography lesson and have the organs and parts of organs 
located and drilled upon. Something is gained if the chil- 
dren are able to locate by pointing with their fingers such 
important organs as the heart, the liver, the appendix, or 
the brain. 
The Use of the Text. In teaching physiology from a text- 
book much the same plan may be used as was used in 
civics. That is, questions that lie close to the interests of 
the pupils should be raised, to be answered by the text or 
by supplementary reading. In listing these questions the 
teacher should select those which he thinks will be of in- 
terest to the pupils. For instance, the textbook before 
me, which I have studied for a short time, has suggested 
a number of questions. I am not sure, of course, that they 
are of interest to every member of any particular class. 
This is a matter which would have to be determined by the 
actual presentation to the class. But as I remember my-
-P-A-G-E-373
  METHODS OF TEACHING 357 
self as a boy it seems to me that they would have been 
interesting. 
This chapter that I have used is entitled, “The Circula- 
tory System.” The questions that follow are not arranged 
in logical order, but are given in the order in which they 
occurred to me. 
The first question I think of is, “What makes a wound 
fester?” This gives a chance to teach white blood cor- 
puscles and washing the wound with some antiseptic. 
When I was a boy we thought that the wound festered be- 
cause the blood was bad.  Lister’s discovery that if a 
wound was cleaned with an antiseptic there was no danger 
of festering had not reached us. Other questions follow 
without comment. Why is it that sometimes when you 
cut yourself blood squirts out while at other times it oozes? 
This brings up the question of arteries and veins. What 
color is pure blood? Impure blood? What sort of liquid 
isinablister? Why isa drinker’s face red? What happens 
in the body when people blush? Where is your heart? 
How does the heart do its work? Why do we stick pigs in 
the neck? How can we stop nose-bleed? What is there 
in the blood that makes it clot? If a friend had a very 
severe wound in the arm or leg how would you stop him 
from bleeding to death? How does what you eat get into 
the blood? How fast does the pulse beat? What makes 
it beat? 
The foregoing are only a few of the possible questions 
on this chapter. Others will occur to any one who works 
upon it. Children themselves ask the questions which, if 
jotted down, will do for other classes in the following years. 
To teach this subject successfully the teacher must have 
a number of supplementary physiologies and bulletins 
collected from the sources mentioned above. This is 
necessary because very few books on the subject lay suffi-
-P-A-G-E-374
358 HEALTH EDUCATION 
cient stress upon hygiene and sanitation. The majority of 
the country schools now use texts that emphasize anatomy 
and physiology and only incidentally deal with hygiene 
and sanitation. Even where the text does not deal pri- 
marily with hygiene it is a good thing to have several of 
them on hand; boys and girls like to read about physiology 
and hygiene if they can find it simply written and well 
illustrated. 
It may be necessary in the case of some of the adopted 
physiologies for the teacher to make certain that some 
consideration is given to bacteriology and sanitation in the 
course. The readers of newspapers to-day know a great 
deal about bacteriology but the lack of knowledge upon 
the subject on the part of pupils in many communities is 
surprising and tragic. Many people take germs with a 
laugh, but fortunately information upon the subject is 
offered free by boards of health, by state universities, and 
by medical societies. It can be made easily available to 
any teacher who will consult the nurse or doctor or will 
write to the state university. There is no defense for the 
teacher who is not sufficiently interested to gather it. 
There are many people and organizations who are not only 
able but anxious to provide such literature. 
Physical Exercises. For children in the rural schools 
physical exercise is not a serious problem. They get a good 
deal of it. Occasionally, however, even in the country, 
there are boys and girls who do not get sufficient exercise, 
and the teacher should see that they do. Particularly is 
this true in poorly ventilated schoolhouses where the six 
school hours are a serious handicap to health. Teachers 
in such buildings should not only see that the ventilation is 
as good as possible but they should stop in the middle of the 
periods before and after recess, raise the windows high, even 
in winter, and put the pupils through a series of exercises

which will expand the chest and particularly stretch the 
muscles of the trunk. Setting-up exercises are also of impor- 
tance because the work of the farm develops muscles which 
tend to keep the shoulders from being straight and erect. 
Play. Country children even more than city children 
need to have an opportunity to play. The city children 
frequently do not have the space, but the country children 
do not live close enough together to congregate in groups 
sufficiently large to play and very often the variety of 
games that they can play is very narrow. Moreover, 
country children have so many duties to perform around 
the home that they do not have a great deal of time. to 
play. Yet the pleasure that comes from playing is so 
deep and the importance of play is so great in the develop- 
ment of children that the teacher should give careful at- 
tention to the matter to see that a variety of games are 
provided. Descriptions of these games can be found in 
such a book as that of Andress, but even where books are 
not available the teacher can collect from other communi- 
ties and schools the games which are particularly popular 
with the children and introduce them to his group. More- 
over, he should seize the opportunity of participating in 
the games with the children wherever possible. It gives 
a kind of contact with the children that reflects upon their 
conduct in the schoolroom and increases their respect and 
admiration for him. 
Projects. The methods that are described in Collings are 
illustrations of the project method. When Collings’ 
teacher sought to help the farmer whose child had developed 
typhoid his pupils were working upon a project. Develop- 
ing a correct sitting posture, cleaning the teeth, preventing 
colds and controlling measles are all examples of the project. 
Numerous other projects come to mind, such as extermina- 
tion of flies, the screening of schoolhouse windows, getting

rid of rats, sleeping with the windows open, keeping the 
hands clean, and cleaning up the barnyard. These are a 
few of the simple projects that come quickly to mind, 
They are projects because they involve planning and 
thought and occur in their natural setting. They are not 
manufactured as a school exercise, but are actual problems 
which arise outside of school, and which, when introduced 
into school, do not change in character. The function of 
the school in connection with the project is well illustrated 
in these cases. The school helps the children to solve the 
problems in a way that they could not be solved by the 
children without the help of the school.

CHAPTER XIV 
AGRICULTURE 
1. Subject-Matter 
Function. The subject of elementary agriculture as taught 
in rural schools consists usually of agronomy, animal hus- 
bandry, horticulture, farm management, and roads. Ag- 
ronomy is the subject whose function is the investigation of 
soils and crops; animal husbandry is concerned with the 
breeding, judging, and care of animals; horticulture is con- 
cerned with plants, trees, and vegetables; in farm manage- 
ment the most economical and efficient methods of han- 
dling crop production and marketing are considered; and 
roads deals with the question its name signifies. 
Ideals. In the study of agriculture four ideals may be de- 
veloped. (1) The study of the subject should heighten 
the appreciation of agriculture and the love of farm life. 
To know that scientists are working upon the subject shows 
that it is of some worth. To learn new ways of doing 
things, which appeal to common sense as being practical, 
increases interest. And the mastery of these methods 
produces that efficiency and financial gain which makes 
living on the farm attractive. Such an appreciation of 
agriculture keeps boys and girls on the farm and tends to 
decrease the movement from the country to the city. The 
advantages of country life have been painted in glowing 
colors, but so long as roads are poor, labor unintelligent, 
and drudgery ever-present, these pictures will have no 
weight with the boys and girls who keenly feel the defects 
of country life. The farmer always has to work hard, but 
   
-P-A-G-E-378
362 AGRICULTURE 
if he sees that he can have full scope for the use of his 
brains he will be much better satisfied. (2) The second 
ideal that can be developed is scholarliness. The children 
should be stimulated to become students of farm problems 
and store away in their minds a mass of definite information 
concerning agricultural methods and rural life. (8) The 
ideal of thinking things through for themselves should also 
be developed in the students. This can be done chiefly by 
recourse to the problem and project method of teaching. 
(4) The ideal of developing skill in the use of the informa- 
tion they gain should be worked upon. They should be 
taught to realize that knowing agricultural facts is not 
sufficient — that success is dependent upon ability to run 
a farm successfully. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. In teaching agriculture there 
are three important objectives for the teacher. (1) It is 
a teacher’s business to develop in the pupils a love for farm 
life and for the subject of agriculture. (2) When the chil- 
dren have left the eighth grade they should have been 
taught as many of the important principles of agriculture 
as eighth-grade children can understand. (3) It is the 
business of the teacher to see that the children actually 
apply the knowledge which they have gained to the carry- 
ing out of school projects on the farm and the solving of 
their other problems which the school has not set. 
Course of Study. In the grades the course of study in 
agriculture is not, and cannot be, entirely systematic. 
Here, if anywhere, the local needs determine what parts of 
the limitless field of agriculture should be studied. In the 
corn belt one set of problems will be emphasized, in the 
wheat belt another, and in the cotton belt a third. In one 
locality poultry is the important subject while in another 
cattle, and in still another fruit growing. 
It has been the history of every subject taught in the
-P-A-G-E-379
SUBJECT-MATTER 363 
grades that when first used it is practical, but before long 
it becomes systematized. When it reaches this point the 
life has probably been pressed out of it. But a new day 
has brought hope for agriculture, for everywhere educators 
are now, as never before, laying stress upon the necessity 
for making grade subjects practical. It is therefore hoped 
that this greatest of rural school subjects will be saved from 
the fossilization which its predecessors have undergone. 
To accomplish this the teacher should use the textbook 
only as a means to the solution of problems. It should not 
decide for the teacher all the topics to be studied, nor the 
amount of time to be spent on each. The writer of any 
given textbook lived in one locality and, consciously or 
unconsciously, constructed his text for that locality. Yet 
some class in a school a thousand miles away and living in 
a locality where topics other than those emphasized in the 
book are of greater importance, may have to use his test. 
In such a case it is quite absurd to allow the text to deter- 
mine the order of topics or the time that is spent upon each. 
_The wise teacher will diagnose his community to find 
out the chief local crops and the most pressing agricultural 
needs. Having decided which of these are of most im- 
portance he will map out a two-year course of topics for 
the seventh and eighth grades. Then he will see that the 
books in the library, the text, and the bulletins from the 
Department of Agriculture at Washington and from 
the local agricultural college are used to discover what 
they have to say on these subjects. These materials 
should be put at the disposal of the pupils, who will read 
them in the handling of their topics. 
The distinctive course in agriculture should be given in 
the seventh and eighth grades. It will be easy for work in 
these grades to alternate because agriculture is not a 
systematic subject like grammar, and the work of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  364 AGRICULTURE 
seventh grade is not necessary as a preparation for the 
work in the eighth grade. 
In handling problems by this method the teacher must 
bear in mind that certain principles of scientific agriculture 
should be learned by the pupils. According to Nolan 
these consist of facts relatitig to permanent soil fertility, 
principles and facts concerning the life histories of benefi- 
cial and injurious insects, stages of fungus diseases, and 
principles and methods of plant and animal breeding. 
The teacher can check the facts taught in the textbook 
against these and supplement the text with other principles 
which may not be included in it. 
Summary. Topics in the course of study should be practical. 
Agriculture must not be made a mere book subject. It cannot 
be taught without supplementary books and bulletins and when 
the pupils have finished the course they should have a knowledge 
of the important principles of scientific agriculture. 
Nature Study. During the first six grades instruction 
may be given in that form of nature study which prepares 
for the study of agriculture and develops appreciation of 
rural nature. To quote Nolan: 
There are six facts to be borne in mind in the selection of nature 
study material to be used in rural schools. (1) Nature study is 
a direct observation study of the common things and processes 
of nature from the standpoint of our human interest in nature as 
it touches our daily life directly. (2) Nature study should be 
differentiated from technical science both in subject-matter and 
in method. It may contribute to the further study of the science 
but it should not be technical, even though it be reduced to words 
of one syllable. (3) The aims of nature study are (a) to give ~ 
general acquaintance with, and interest in, the common things 
and processes of nature; (b) to give training in accurate observa- 
tion as a means of gaining knowledge directly from nature; (¢) to 
give pupils useful knowledge concerning natural objects and 
processes as they directly affect human life interest. (4) The 
methods of all nature study should be observational. The teacher 
and pupils must here escape from textbooks and walls. Nature 
study and agriculture are live subjects and so are out-of-doors.
-P-A-G-E-381
SUBJECT-MATTER 365 
The pupils must see real things and see them themselves. (5) The 
materials to be studied must be the most common and the most 
interesting from the standpoint of everyday life. (6) Nature 
study must be for the child and not for the adult. We must 
recognize the principles of child study in all nature study work. 
The primary pupils ask, ““What is it?” The intermediate pupils 
ask, “How?” and the upper-grade pupils ask, ““Why?” in the 
presence of natural phenomena, and the school, through nature 
study, should answer these questions for the child. 
For a detailed statement of the course in nature study 
based upon these facts the reader is referred to the Nolan 
reference at the end of the chapter. 
The Project. Agriculture is the home of the project 
method. It was worked out in this field in some detail 
before it was adopted by teachers of other subjects. The 
state of Massachusetts was the first to develop the so-called 
“home project.” In its schools the pupils undertook 
some project, such as poultry raising, at home for a whole 
year. They were then given for this project, a number of 
hens, chicks, and eggs, and it became their business to care 
for these and handle them as a business proposition. Then 
the school work in agriculture for that year centered partic- 
ularly around poultry. In other years other projects were 
carried through. The instructor was hired for the year 
and visited the home projects during the summer months. 
There is no longer any question about the value of projects 
in agriculture. They vitalize the work to a remarkable 
degree. Projects produce a deeper interest in school work 
than the ordinary textbook school work. They auto- 
matically make the pupils apply the information given in 
textbooks and they develop skill in performing farm prac- 
tices. The boy may study about insects and insecticides 
in the textbook and learn little from the study, but if he 
has failed to use this knowledge in growing potatoes and 
finds that his crop has been reduced by twenty-five per 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
366 AGRICULTURE 
cent because he failed to sterilize them, he will never forget 
that portion of the agriculture textbook again. The 
methods of using the home project will be described at a 
later point in the chapter. 
2. Interest 
Immediate Interest. As in all other subjects, so in agri- 
culture there may be either immediate interest in the sub- 
ject or no interest. In this subject, however, the interest 
is essentially immediate for country pupils because it is 
for them a bread-and-butter subject. 
The great problem is to sustain interest. To do this it 
is necessary not only to pick out interesting topics but to 
select the most interesting. It is necessary also that care 
be taken to select easy reading matter and to make diffi- 
cult bulletins easier to study through judicious selection of 
the material to be read. If care is taken to make all the 
work and all the reading practical and fairly easy the in- 
terest will be sustained. The reading material must not, 
however, be too easy, because boys and girls do not like to 
read material that seems childish. When it is just hard 
enough to make them exert themselves in a vigorous and 
healthy manner it will be most effective. 
Agriculture Clubs. Many schools and school officials use 
the club plan of work. This is becoming increasingly easy 
in the country because of the presence of county agents 
whose business it is to organize community clubs for chil- 
dren as well as adults. Frequently the county agent does 
not get from teachers the codperation that is essential to 
his work. Sometimes this is his fault and sometimes the 
trouble lies with the teacher who, through indifference or 
hostility, neither makes advances nor codperates when 
assistance is asked for. But whether the teacher works 
with the county agent or not there is much that he can do  
-P-A-G-E-383
  
  INTEREST 367 
in getting his students to carry on club work in one or 
more groups. Participation in agricultural exhibits and 
contests set for school children in the community or county 
is highly desirable. In brief, it may be said that every 
method for stimulating interest by an appeal to the social 
instincts of children should be used. 
Besides the appeal to group work and participation in 
contests, there is another interest that should be utilized. 
This is the economic interest. If the children can be put 
upon projects which will earn them money, interest will be 
sustained. Sometimes the children have interest in saving 
money for their parents by canning, growing vegetables, 
etc., but this does not always appeal as strongly as do 
projects by which they can make money for themselves to 
be spent as they may wish. This method of appealing to 
the students is frequently an easy one to arrange for by 
the teacher who recognizes its value. Sometimes the ar- 
rangements may be made with the parents, to whom this 
method of securing interest may not have occurred. At 
other times it is sufficient to mention it to the children. 
The farmer’s children have many more opportunities of 
earning money than have city children, and this incentive 
should be used quite frequently. 
The notion that it is wrong to have children work for 
money is old-fashioned. It would be dangerous if they 
never did anything unless they were paid for it, but they 
have to do so many things without pay through love of 
parents, the desire to help, etc., that no harm can come 
from giving them two or three things during the year out 
of which they can make money for themselves. 
Another means of creating interest in agriculture is found 
in its correlation with the other subjects of the course of 
study. The first to come to mind is arithmetic. In the 
chapter on arithmetic we showed how arithmetic would be
-P-A-G-E-384
    368 AGRICULTURE 
benefited through the use of practical problems around 
the farm and home. Conversely, these problems increase 
interest in the farm and home because the everyday project 
is seen in a new light when it is made the subject of study 
in school. Language, also, may wisely make use of the 
topics of everyday farm life and the value of these topics 
be thereby increased. Poetry may be used to good ad- 
vantage. There are found in every set of readers a few 
classics that deal with farm life, such as “The Barefoot 
Boy,” or “Pictures of Memory,” but it still remains for 
some one to compile a supplementary reader, rich and in- 
teresting, which contains nothing but poems about farm 
life and the value of agriculture. Perhaps no subject has 
received more attention from poets from the days of Horace 
and Virgil until now, but the farm boy sees few of such 
poems. This is true in spite of the fact that the knowledge 
of this poetry should be second only to the study of agri- 
culture and community civics in developing a deep and 
rich appreciation of farm life. Other subjects, likewise, may 
be correlated with agriculture to the mutual benefit of both. 
Summary. In developing an interest in the study of agricul- 
ture considerable reliance can be placed upon immediate interest. 
But to sustain this interest the children should be given easy 
reading material. ‘They should have the full stimulus arising 
from social organization and competition, they should be per- 
mitted to earn money for themselves, and the subject should be 
correlated with other branches of the course of study. 
3. Methods of Teaching 
Projects. In developing the home project in agriculture 
four steps are necessary as indicated in some of the refer- 
ences given at the end of the chapter. (1) Plans for the 
project must be made. (2) A calendar of monthly occu- 
pations for all field and indoor work, notebook and record 
work, reading and study, for each month of the year should
-P-A-G-E-385
  METHODS OF TEACHING 369 
be prepared. (3) The study of the technical subject- 
matter should parallel, in so far as possible, the home work, 
and should include all closely related topics. (4) Simple 
laboratory work should be correlated with the project work 
in seasonal sequence. 
A detailed list of projects will be found in several of the 
references at the end of this chapter. These will be sug- 
gestive, but the teacher must, in selecting from them or in 
selecting other projects, bear in mind that activities of 
superior interest to the particular community in which he 
is teaching must be chosen. 
Problem Solving. In the study of agriculture through 
the project, or outside of it, we have a parallel with the 
methods described in teaching arithmetic. First, a good 
practical problem is set. For instance, this may be the 
picking out of ten good ears of corn. The children go te 
the corn pile or bin and experiment. The data that they 
use is their knowledge of what constitutes a good ear. 
They form hypotheses; that is, in this case, they examine 
one ear after another and finally select ten. These are 
checked up by the teacher, or some other corn judge, to 
see whether or not the selection is correct. Or the problem 
may be that of preparing a piece of ground for wheat. The 
data are the things the pupils know about the topic, and 
the material found in books and pamphlets. They think 
it over, discuss it, make suggestions, and finally arrive at 
a solution. To check, they have to wait until the wheat is 
grown; and, after all other factors are taken into account, 
they are able to see that the yield is better because of the 
preparation decided upon. 
Collecting Data. The hardest problem in agriculture is 
giving the pupils data upon which to work. For instance, 
in the selection of ten good ears of corn the data are the 
things they know about good corn. This they have to
-P-A-G-E-386
370 AGRICULTURE 
learn from the study of agriculture. Or, in our second ex- 
ample, the data are the facts about a good seed bed as they 
are given in bulletins and books. This has to be sought 
for with great care and memorized with exactness. 
The best way of teaching these data is to take up problems 
first and teach a few data at a time. For instance, in corn 
judging, it is not wise to teach all the factors in a good ear 
at first, and then judge. Much better results will be gained 
by the teacher if he gives the pupils two ears, one of which 
has good kernels and the other poor, and then asks which 
has the better kernels. When they make their guess, the 
kernel factor may be studied until they know the difference 
between a good kernel and a poor one. Then they may 
test this out by ranking ears by kernels and by nothing 
else. Then when this has been mastered, two ears, one 
having a good tip, the other a poor one, may be given to 
the pupils; and they may be asked to select the better tip, 
with reasons for their choice. This will lead to an explana- 
tion of the characteristics of a good tip. Then they may 
grade a group of ears by tips alone. 
In this way all the points of a good ear may be studied 
one by one, and after all are studied, the pupils may be 
put upon the problem of selecting good ears by the score 
card, including all the points. 
In this way the data — or, rather, the facts that govern 
them — may be picked up one by one and used in testing 
until they are remembered, before giving other data. This 
method avoids the waste of pouring in a mass of facts 
before they are used or have a chance to be remembered. 
Summary. In gathering facts they should be taught little by 
little, as the solution to little problems. In this way they will be 
remembered more exactly. 
Intelligent Guessing. If pupils are allowed to work 
things out for themselves there is a gain both in interest
-P-A-G-E-387
  METHODS OF TEACHING 371 
and in understanding. For instance, if the teacher says 
the characteristics of the tip of an ear of corn are such and 
such, the result is not nearly so beneficial as when he says, 
“Which of these two ears has the better tip?” The latter 
method is better because the pupils then begin to think. 
This thinking may lead them to work out the characteristics 
of a good tip for themselves, or, if not, when the charac- 
teristics of the tips are given, their minds will be active 
and ready to take hold of the facts. 
Nothing has a more deadening effect upon interest than 
to have everything told to one. Even if the pupils spend 
much time in guessing intelligently, no time is lost, for 
what they get they get well. Whenever a boy is given an 
interesting task of his own, no matter what, and is allowed 
to put his own initiative into it, he may make mistakes, but 
he is gaining experience in the best school of experience in 
the world — the school of practical initiative. If a teacher 
does not tell too much and allows the children to get a few 
things for themselves, teaching will be full of fun for him 
and drudgery will fly away, for the strain of teaching comes 
from the daily lift of a burden of childish apathy. Give 
the pupil a chance to make intelligent guesses, and he will , 
accept the chance to gain intelligent judgment. ’ 
Summary. To guess intelligently is the highest type of think- ' 
ing, and should be utilized to the full extent. 
Field Work. Methods of teaching agriculture lead in- 
evitably to field work. Part of the teaching has to be done 
through trips to the farm where the material for instruc- 
tion can be found in its natural setting. In the Storm and 
Davis reference at the end of the chapter many detailed 
suggestions will be found for observation work in connec- 
tion with field crops, animal husbandry, dairying, poultry 
husbandry, and horticulture. By way of illustration a
-P-A-G-E-388
372 AGRICULTURE 
few of those connected with field-crop work may be men- 
tioned. Pupils should know the kind of weather when 
the pollen of corn is scattering and see that the silks of the 
corn are dry, or in condition to receive the pollen. They 
should observe the time of the germination of any field 
crop after the day of planting, and make memoranda of the 
moisture conditions of the soil at the time. They should 
also know how long after blossoming small corn requires 
for the maturity of the crop. They should observe how 
long a field of corn planted for roasting ears remains in 
marketable condition and how soon after blossoming an 
early crop of Irish potatoes may be harvested. These 
suggest to our minds the enormous number of farm ques- 
tions upon which accurate data may be collected, and con- 
versely show how futile is a course in agriculture which is 
confined entirely to a study of the book. 
Drill. The same rules for drill apply here as have been 
described throughout the textbook. Whatever is drilled 
upon should first be clearly understood and then repeated 
attentively until it becomes automatic. In agriculture care 
must be taken to have all the work clearly understood and 
to have those things which the pupils will use when they 
grow up selected for drill. Particularly such items as 
tables of constituents of rations and the points in judging 
cereals and animals should be memorized thoroughly. 
Illustrative Material. Large numbers of farm bulletins 
published by the Department of Agriculture at Washing- 
ton, the various state agricultural colleges, and many com- 
mercial institutions should be collected and catalogued. A 
plan for cataloguing is given by Nolan in the reference cited 
at the end of the chapter. 
When this has been accomplished, only a small portion 
of the illustrative material that is available has been col- 
lected. For instance, no recitation in agronomy should
-P-A-G-E-389
METHODS OF TEACHING 373 
be conducted without considerable illustrative material. 
If the lesson is one in connection with corn, there should be 
collected corn of all types, on the cob and in bottles. Corn 
products such as sugar, syrup, starch, breakfast foods, etc., 
stalks of corn, tassels, and silk should be used for illustra- 
tion. Corn tillage implements should be available. Fer- 
tilizers and lime should be shown, together with samples of 
bad weeds. 
The students should form the habit of collecting the illus- 
trative material for use in the classes and then of assembling 
it for use in recitation. 
To material of this sort may be added pictures, suitably 
mounted on tough bookcover paper, gray in color, and col- 
lected from various sources such as catalogues, agricultural 
journals, machinery companies, fertilizer companies, seed. 
houses, and manufacturers. Local subjects may be photo- 
graphed. These may sometimes be made into lantern 
slides. In more ambitious communities local films may 
be made or used when obtainable from the county agent or 
the state agricultural college or manufacturers of farm 
equipment. 
Summary. To make the teaching of agriculture vivid, illus- 
trative material should be drawn from every possible source, in- 
cluding farm products, bulletins, and pictures. 
The School Laboratory. In the seventh and eighth 
grades some simple school laboratory exercises may be 
carried on. The object is to transfer to the schoolroom 
some of the study which cannot be so well carried on by 
observation on the farm. For instance, in the germina- 
tion of seeds, it is possible through the use of soil and seeds 
in a common window-box for the children to watch from 
day to day, in great detail, the processes to which they 
may never have paid attention in the fields at home. 
Laboratory work can easily demand very expensive equip-

ment, but this is out of the question in the elementary 
school. Yet it is surprising how much work of this sort 
can be done with simple home-made equipment if the teacher 
is looking for opportunities. 
Nature Study. Nolan gives a number of illustrative 
lessons to be used in the teaching of nature study. His 
problem in teaching the facts about the common objects 
of nature is to secure educative problems and set useful 
exercises. One such lesson is presented as an illustration 
of the type of questions and exercises that should be used. 
This is a lesson on the robin, and indicates what the chil- 
dren can be asked to do in order to increase their knowledge 
of and appreciation of this delightful member of the bird 
family.

  CHAPTER XV 
SUMMARY OF METHODS 
Contrary to the usual practice in textbooks of this sort we 
have deliberately left until the end a general statement of 
methods of teaching. It is much easier to understand a 
general method when it is applied to specific cases than it is 
to understand an abstract statement of the method with- 
out applications. Our plan has been to make the applica- 
tions first in connection with the different subjects, and 
then give the methods together in systematic form as a 
summary and review. 
The important part of this summarizing chapter is nct , 
the statement in the body of the chapter. The questions 
at the end which assist you in going over the preceding 
chapters and systematizing them are of more importance. 
The topical index at the end of the book will be found help- 
ful in finding page references. 
The Function of Teaching. The aim that the school as 
a social agency has in view has been stated in various ways. | 
The particular statement underlying our discussions is 
this: The function of teaching is to assist pupils to appre- 4 
ciate and control the values of life. This means that the 
schools seek to help pupils to do what they want to do. 
If they want to learn to write the school should teach them 
how. If they wish to learn to read, they should be assisted i 
to the control and mastery of reading. But in addition, — 
the school has to teach them to appreciate what is worth 
doing. Children often do not want to do quite important:
-P-A-G-E-393
SUMMARY OF METHODS 377 
things and they have to be directed in this matter. So 
children should be assisted in school not only to do what 
they want to do, but also to want to do what is best for 
them to do. 
The Function of Subject-Matter. The subjects taught 
in school, each in its own way, help the pupils to get control 
of values. Each has a different function to perform. For 
instance, spelling assists in the communication of ideas by 
presenting the order of letters in words. Writing also 
assists in communication, but its function differs from 
spelling in that it advises about the form of letters. Arith- 
metic gives control of those values in which number is 
used. In short, the intrinsic function of each subject is to 
assist pupils to control specifically different values. 
Other functions of subject-matter are often given. We 
are told that study in school strengthens the memory, the 
imagination, and the reasoning powers. Moreover, some 
subjects are studied as a preparation for the pursuit of 
other subjects. For example, we study algebra to get 
ready for college mathematics. Then, some subjects are 
studied because ignorance of them will make people criti- 
cize us. If, for instance, we speak ungrammatically, edu- 
cated people may make fun of us. 
These reasons for the study of a subject in school are 
called the indirect functions or uses to which-the studies 
are put. They are not the intrinsic functions for, which 
the subjects were organized. That is, when arithmetic 
was begun by people ages ago, the arithmeticians did not 
say, “What we must find is some means for training the 
memory.” Rather they said, “We want to find a means for 
handling number,” but we found that when numbers were 
handled systematically and persistently the memory was 
strengthened, so we speak of such results of study as indirect. 
There are three classes of indirect function. We speak
-P-A-G-E-394
378 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
of the first as the training and discipline of the mind. The 
second is called a preparatory function, when we find that 
by studying one subject we get ready for studying another 
more advanced. The third is known as the decorative 
function, when a knowledge of a subject leads people to 
feel that we are well educated. 
The important point to be made in connection with all 
this is that if we find no reason for studying any subject 
except these indirect results, it is better not to study it. 
We must pay attention to the intrinsic function, for each 
subject is a tool fitted for its own particular work, and this 
intrinsic and peculiar function we ought to keep in mind. 
Summary. The intrinsic function of subject-matter is to assist 
pupils to understand and control things worth while. Each sub- 
ject is fitted to perform a special bit of work. Certain indirect 
results come from the study of subjects, and these are classified 
as disciplinary, preparatory, and decorative. 
The Structure of Subject-Matter. Whenever man makes 
anything he first of all has its function in mind. It has 
some purpose. Then in making it he tries to organize it 
in such a way that it will carry out its function most effi- 
ciently, and if he makes it well, every part will be related 
to this function. For instance, the watch is made in order 
to show correct time, and every wheel, pivot, or mark on 
the face has something to do with this function. Each 
has a reason for being there. So, therefore, everything 
that is made by man has both a function and a structure. 
The elements of the structure are all necessary for the 
carrying out of the function, if the thing is well constructed. 
This holds true for each subject taught in the curriculum. 
It has its main divisions and its subordinate divisions. 
History is divided into ancient, medieval, modern, Eng- 
lish, and American divisions. American history may again 
be divided into the Colonial Period, the Revolutionary
-P-A-G-E-395

\ 
SUMMARY OF METHODS 379 
Period, the Period of the Constitution, and so on. More- 
over, each of these may again be divided and subdivided. 
Each item of history or of any other subject, down to the 
most minute detail, is included in it in order to carry out 
the main function or purpose which is set for the subject. 
If any subject is well constructed it has one chief char- 
acteristic. It contains nothing that is irrelevant to the 
function. Since an outline is a statement of the main 
points in a structure, each point in the outline should be 
relevant to the subject and should bear upon the central 
topic or function. 
Summary. Each unit of subject-matter is organized to carry 
out a function, and it is characteristic of the good structure that 
i there be present in it nothing irrelevant. 
Ideals. Ideals are qualities of personality and character 
which are made the objects of desire and effort. These 
ideals are of use in life as standards according to which we 
perform activities and solve problems and satisfy needs. 
The person who sets up accuracy as an ideal will try to do 
everything that he does in an accurate way. When he de- 
sires to be open-minded he will study the problems of his- 
tory, geography, and civics in a way that is different from 
that of one who is prejudiced. 
Ideals are of much more importance than information. 
If, for instance, we had to choose between making children 
honest and teaching them arithmetic there is no question 
in the mind of any thoughtful person that ability to be 
honest would be chosen in preference to a knowledge of 
multiplication. But fortunately, no such choice needs to 
be made. We can teach ideals and give information at 
the same time. Moreover, we can teach the ideals through 
the subjects. It is possible to set up the ideals of accuracy, 
neatness, and speed in connection with the teaching of 
handwriting, for instance.
-P-A-G-E-396
380 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
The schools have not given the teaching of ideals the place 
that the subject should occupy in the classroom. We have 
been inclined to allow them to take care of themselves or to 
teach them quite incidentally, and we all know that, as some 
one has said, “Incidental teaching is accidental teaching.” 
In connection with each of the subjects we have in this 
book set up a few ideals which are particularly important. 
The lists are not complete. They are merely suggestive. 
If, when a child finished school, he had no ideals except 
the total number of those mentioned in the chapter, he 
would be lacking in some very important ones. But if the 
reader will make a list of those that are mentioned he will 
find that we have covered a rather wide range and all that 
is necessary to do is to see that in school discipline and or- 
ganization and in the life of children outside of school the 
other fundamental ideals are emphasized. Unfortunately 
no such list has ever been scientifically prepared, so the 
teacher is left to his own initiative in selecting the supple- 
mentary ideals which he believes to be of importance. 
The Teacher’s Objectives. In connection with every 
subject it is necessary for the teacher to decide just what 
he expects the children to have gotten out of the subject 
when it is completed. This needs to be done in considerable 
detail for each grade if the teacher is to be able to work 
efficiently. It is not enough to say that so many pages of 
the book will be covered, for after all we teach books only 
as a means for educating the children, and we need to think, 
not of what is in the book, but of what children are sup- 
posed to get out of the study of the subject. 
The objectives which to me appear to be important are 
listed in connection with each subject and in many cases 
the details of the objectives which could not be included 
for lack of space are found in the references cited at the 
end of each chapter. “ 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
SUMMARY OF METHODS 381 
The Course of Study. It is impossible to teach children 
all that has been discovered in each subject. Moreover, 
the graduates of the elementary school would have no use 
for all of it. They cannot understand it all nor do they 
have time to learn it all. 
We have, therefore, to make a selection of what we wish 
to teach. This selection is a very hard task and is a 
problem upon which there is great difference of opin- 
ion. Some people will include drawing, music, and the 
industrial arts in the course of study, while others may 
decline to admit the need of them. Some people believe 
that ancient history should be taught while others scorn 
the subject. 
In spite of the fact that we may differ in the details of 
selection the principle by which to select is very easily 
stated. It is this: Pick out the subjects that are most im- 
portant for the children in the community in which they 
live and teach them what they need of these from day to 
day. There may be differences of opinion about what is 
most important and what isnot. We are, however, making 
great strides toward this ideal in several of the subjects. 
Particularly in spelling, investigators have given us a spell- 
ing list concerning which there can be only slight differ- 
ences of opinion, and what has been done in spelling can 
be done equally well for some other formal subjects and 
reasonably well for all of the subjects. 
In the mean time, we have to place our chief reliance upon 
the progressive textbook, where the authors use the latest 
scientific information that is available, but the decisions 
of the author must be passed upon by the teacher in the 
light of his own experience with children and with different 
communities. The inexperienced teacher naturally has to 
rely largely upon the textbook and the opinions of those 
teachers under whom he has received his pedagogical train-
-P-A-G-E-398
  382 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
ing. So, at the present time, the thoughtful teacher and 
the scientifically trained writer of texts must each decide 
upon what he thinks are the most important things for the 
children to study. 
When the subject-matter has thus been selected upon 
the basis of importance, the material has to be arranged 
according to the level of interest and abilities of the chil- 
dren. For instance, young children cannot study exactly 
the same subject-matter that high school students study. 
The children differ from grade to grade. Therefore, after 
we have decided upon what should be taught it is necessary 
to apportion it among the grades according to the interest 
and abilities of the children in each grade. Unfortunately, 
this has not been done with any great degree of success 
as yet, with the result that we find that many things are 
supposed to be taught to children at a time when even the 
best teachers cannot get them interested in them. 
The young teacher has, of course, to follow the course of 
study and the textbook rather closely because as yet he 
does not know children very well. But he should train 
himself to watch for lack of interest and decide whether it 
is due to poor teaching, to the fault of the individual pupil, 
or to the selection of topics that cannot be made interest- 
ing. In the last case such topics should be omitted. 
Summary. In making a course of study the most important 
subjects for pupils should be selected, and these should be appor- 
tioned to the different grades according to the needs and abilities 
of the pupils. 
Diagnosis. During the past ten years we have begun to 
elaborate a technique for the diagnosis of difficulties. 
Formerly teachers of education placed reliance upon gen- 
eral methods of instruction, but now we realize that it is 
impossible at present, if ever, to develop a system of general 
methods which will be completely successful in teaching.
-P-A-G-E-399
SUMMARY OF METHODS 383 
Rather, we have turned to the point of view that in teach- 
ing we need to find out what are the difficulties that the 
children encounter and correct these one by one. If you 
will recall the discussion of this question in the chapter on 
spelling, it is clear that we can find out two types of things. 
First, we can discover what are the most difficult words 
to spell, as well as the peculiar difficulties children have in 
learning to spell. There are, thus, two types of difficulty 
which need to be known — first the difficulties of subject- 
matter, and second the difficulties of the children in its 
mastery. As an illustration of the first type of difficulty 
in spelling we have the Hundred Spelling Demons, while 
as an illustration of the second we have the analysis of 
reasons for children not spelling correctly. 
This method of diagnosis, which has been worked out to 
a less complete degree in arithmetic and silent reading, is 
capable of extension to all the subjects of the curriculum, 
and eventually we hope to be able to put before the begin- 
ning teacher such an analysis for all subjects. But in 
the mean time the teacher can study his own pupils and 
discover in a more or less complete way the difficulties 
which he must use as a basis for correction. Every teacher 
must be a diagnostician and must adopt the scientific 
attitude in the study of his pupils and the technique of 
teaching. 
Interest. The human mind is so organized that it works 
best and most successfully upon those things in which it is 
interested. Interest is the channel through which energy 
flows, and if there is no interest in a subject, no energy will 
be directed toward it. 
The school labors under unusually hard conditions. 
When the children enter they have no interests which are 
connected with the work in school. They may not like 
arithmetic or geography or history and when they do not
-P-A-G-E-400
  384 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
like them it means that these subjects are not tied up in 
any way with the system of interests according to which 
their little lives are directed. Therefore the problem of 
interest is a vital one for the teacher. Society has decided 
that the subjects which are taught in school are more 
or less necessary as a preparation for living. The chil- 
dren are not greatly interested in preparation for living; 
they live in the present, and it thus becomes the duty 
of the teacher by some means to connect these socially 
important subjects with the children’s present system of 
interests. 
Immediate Interest. Fortunately, we find that in some 
eases children have a natural liking for certain subjects. 
As soon as they begin to study them the interest appears 
and, under proper conditions, it may be sustained to the 
end. When children are interested in this way we say 
that the interest is immediate, and by this we mean that 
children like the subject merely because they like it. 
Mediate Interest. Fortunately for us, it is possible to 
develop interest in a subject which is not immediately in- 
teresting. Children can be made to widen their interests. 
When we have an interest in something, not for its own 
sake but because it is useful in carrying out something 
which is of immediate interest, we say that the interest is 
mediate, that is, it is a mediate or second-level interest. 
Mediate interest can be developed in several ways. The 
general principle may easily be stated as follows: Mediate 
interest can be developed in an object by connecting it 
with an immediate interest. The different types of con- 
nection are the folloWing. In the first place, we have a 
great mass of general social interests. The children like 
to please their parents, to secure the approbation of the 
teacher, to stand well in their classes, and to work together 
in groups. In line with this, children frequently develop
-P-A-G-E-401
  SUMMARY OF METHODS 385 
an interest in a subject like arithmetic, which has no im- 
mediate interest, by recourse to the desire for good grades 
to please the parent and the teacher, by the fact that all 
their friends like the subject, by putting them on projects, 
etc. In the second place, children dislike personal discom- 
fort. They do not like to receive corporal punishment, to 
stay in after school, or to be demoted. So it is possible, in 
line with this fact, to use these incentives to develop an 
interest in such a subject as history, for instance. In the 
third place, emotion has a great deal to do with developing 
an interest in asubject. If the teacher has the enthusiasm 
which is highly infectious or has the magnetic personality 
which holds children to him, and if he is deeply in love with 
school learning, he is able to lead the children to like the 
school. When the children have the confidence in him 
which is born of these qualities of leadership, the mere fact 
that he believes the subjects are worth while clothes them 
with an importance which they would not otherwise 
possess. 
All these methods are said to be generic, because they 
apply equally well to all subjects. These generic values 
or incentives constitute a great group of factors in develop- 
ing interest. Some of them are less valuable than others, 
and produce comparatively worthless forms of interest. 
Specifically, we cannot regard highly that interest in arith- 
metic which arises from the fear of corporal ,punishment, 
even though the mediate interest so developed may be 
sufficient to lead the child to become somewhat proficient 
in arithmetic. Yet, on the other hand, others of these in- 
centives are permanent and fundamefital. We cannot get 
away from the fact that human beings, both as children 
and adults, are deeply concerned with the approbation of 
their associates and are strongly influenced by the attitude 
of other people. Such being the case, there is every reason
-P-A-G-E-402
  386 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
why these principles should be used as a method of stimu- 
lating interest in whatever the person does. 
Intrinsic Functions. In addition to these methods of 
developing mediate interest, there is another which is the 
most valuable and which is an outgrowth of the intrinsic 
function of subject-matter. Stated briefly it is as follows: 
An uninteresting object becomes interesting when it is of 
use in doing something which is interesting. This means 
that we can develop a great amount of interest through the 
intrinsic function of subjects and parts of subjects. For 
instance, interest in arithmetic may be developed by tying 
it up with other interesting activities in which it becomes 
necessary to handle numbers. We find children in the 
lower grades learning a great deal of arithmetic rapidly 
and efficiently by the playing of games which involve 
number. When children are playing a game in which 
they become deeply interested, and it becomes necessary 
to count and add in order that the game may proceed with 
speed they will naturally perform the necessary arithmetical 
operations. I have seen little children whose scores in a 
tossing game were placed upon the board dance up and 
down with excitement as some child totaled the columns 
to see who had won. Thousands of such uses of arithmetic 
occur in school. Similarly, an interest in legibility in 
handwriting may be developed through the desire of the 
children to communicate certain ideas, which are very 
important, to them, to other people in writing. And like- 
wise an interest in agriculture can be developed if the boy 
wishes to\grow as good a vegetable garden as possible in 
order to make money or help his mother. 
In using the intrinsic and peculiar function of subjects 
as leads in discovering connections with interesting things, 
all that is}necessary is for the teacher to ask himself, “In 
connectiog with what things the children like to do is this 
     
-P-A-G-E-403
    SUMMARY OF METHODS 387 
subject useful?” and then with alertness and resourceful- 
ness discover such situations and place the children in 
them. 
Summary. While generic incentives are of great value, the in- 
telligent and efficient teacher will place his greatest reliance upon 
connections of subjects and parts of subjects with interesting 
situations through the intrinsic function of the subject. 
Difficulties and Problems. In following out this line of 
thought, we naturally arrive at problems and difficulties. 
The mind of children and adults spends most of its time 
upon the solution of problems and the removal of difficul- 
ties. Problems arise in this way. A child starts to do 
something that he is interested in and finds that he cannot 
do it. Then the problem naturally arises of how to do this 
thing because he is essentially interested in doing it. 
Problems thus arise when difficulties are encountered, but 
in school these problems may be of two sorts. They may 
be connected with something in which the child is interested 
or they may not. The problem of how to keep the hands 
clean is quite important to one who is interested in hy- 
giene or social approval, but if the boy is interested in 
neither, it will not be a real problem to him. It will be a 
problem to his teacher and his mother. Consequently, if 
we wish to have children work upon problems we must be 
sure that they are connected with something which is of 
interest. 
When, however, the problem is interesting, the process 
of reasoning enters, and when the process of reasoning 
enters we have reached a very significant point in educa- 
tion, for one of the chief objectives of the school is to teach 
children to reason well in whatever they do. 
Reasoning consists of five steps. In the first place, the 
child must feel a need, which is not very clearly defined. 
In the second, he proceeds to define this need and put it in
-P-A-G-E-404
  388 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
the form of a problem. Third, he thinks of different ways 
of solving the problem. Fourth, he thinks these ways 
through until he finds a solution that seems to be satis- 
factory, and fifth, he verifies this solution to see if it works. 
For instance, the children may want to do something for 
Thanksgiving, but they do not know exactly what. Then 
they decide that they will give a Thanksgiving program 
and the problem becomes that of deciding what this program 
shall be. Many suggestions are made, and these are talked 
over with the result that the program is finally decided 
upon. Then the program is given, and if it is successful 
with the audience they are satisfied with the solution they 
got. 
In some cases these steps are not all present. For in- 
stance, the teacher may assign certain problems in arith- 
metic and the children may be interested in working out a 
solution. In this case, we start with the second step — 
the defined problem. Then the children study this problem 
and think of different ways of doing it. They discuss or 
think over the possibility of using the one solution or the 
other and finally work the problem through. Then they 
check the problem to see if it is correct. 
These five steps may be summarized as (1) the felt need; 
(2) the defined problem; (3) suggestions for solution; 
(4) elaboration of these suggestions; (5) verification. 
Induction. In certain cases the problem may be that of 
finding general principles. For instance, we may wish to 
discover a rule in grammar or in arithmetic. In either of 
these cases the teacher may state the rule, but it can be 
made a problem for the children in which they discover 
their own rule for themselves. Tlustrations of this may 
be found in the chapter on grammar. Here the problem 
steps are modified as follows. In framing the rule they 
must first study some of the cases, then they must com-
-P-A-G-E-405
  SUMMARY OF METHODS 389 
pare these to see the respects in which they are alike, and 
third they may form the general rule. A particular case 
of this is found in the Herbartian Five Formal Steps. 
These steps are called: preparation, presentation, com- 
parison, generalization, and application. In the first step 
— preparation — the problem to be solved is stated. In 
the second — presentation — the particular cases are pre- 
sented and studied; in the third — comparison — these 
particular cases are compared; in the fourth — generaliza- 
tion — the rule, principle, definition or law is stated, and 
in the fifth — application — the generalization is drilled 
upon and used in solving other problems. It will be noticed 
that in the second, third, and fourth steps we have the 
three steps involved in induction. The Five Formal 
Steps are useful whenever the problem is that of forming 
rules or making definitions. 
Deduction. The problem may take still another form. 
There are times when we can solve a problem by using 
rules which we already know. For instance, I wonder 
whether or not the low standing of a pupil is due to defec- 
tive eyesight. I already know the general principle that 
if boys’ eyes are good they can read letters of a certain size 
at twenty feet. I find that this boy cannot do so, there- 
fore I decide that his eyes are bad. Here I have used a 
general rule to handle a particular case. 
In induction we have seen that we examine particular 
cases in order to find a general rule. That is how the rule 
about reading letters at a certain distance was worked out; 
many eyes were tested and the results compared. But in 
deduction, in the illustration above, I already have a rule, 
and I apply it to the case of the particular boy whom I had 
not examined before. Deduction involves three steps: 
First I know many general rules; second, I am confronted 
with a particular case, and third, I try to find the rule that
-P-A-G-E-406
  390 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
will fit the case or try to find a particular case that will fit 
the rule. 
Deduction is used in every subject. It will be remem- 
bered that it was developed in the chapter on geography. 
In arithmetic little time is taken in learning rules and 
processes, but most of the pupils’ time is spent in solving 
problems by the application of known rules. In grammar 
the learning of definitions is a matter of induction, for all 
parsing and analysis involves the use of definitions or rules 
in handling particular cases. In drawing, history, read- 
ing, and music deduction is also frequently used. 
Summary. In problem solving there are five steps. First, a 
felt need; second, a defined problem; third, suggestions for solu- 
tion; fourth, elaboration of suggestions; fifth, verification. Two 
special forms of problem solving occur. In induction the problem 
is that of discovering a rule, and the steps are (1) the study of par- 
ticular cases; (2) their comparison; (3) generalization and (4) veri- 
fication of the generalization. The special form of induction is 
known as the Herbartian Five Formal Steps. They are (1) prepa- 
ration (2) presentation (3) comparison (4) generalization (5) ap- 
plication. In deduction the problem takes another form. Here 
we wish. to apply generalizations already known. .The factors are 
(1) general principles (2) particular cases (8) deduction. 
Projects. The problem assumes another form in the 
project. When a problem is rather large, and is carried on 
in its natural setting, we call it a project. By natural 
setting we mean a setting which is found outside of school 
or is not modified greatly by being introduced into school. 
We thus have home projects and school projects. When 
we are looking for projects we ask ourselves the question: 
“What are some of the things which children naturally do 
or are expected to do outside of school and in school which 
involve a good deal of thinking, and which are not too 
difficult for them to carry out nor yet so simple as to destroy 
interest?”? Many examples of these are found throughout 
the text.
-P-A-G-E-407
  SUMMARY OF METHODS 391 
Children are not always interested in projects but when 
they are the interest is likely to be very deep because they 
have a chance to think, and they are working upon things 
which are very much worth while for many reasons other 
than the desire to do well in school. 
Not all material in school, however, can be taught by the 
project method. It is not practical for the teacher to or- 
ganize the curriculum completely upon a project basis. 
There are times when it is necessary to give drill upon in- 
formation which is going to be primarily valuable, but 
which the children cannot completely memorize in carry- 
ing out projects, and it is quite important, in the upper 
grades especially, that the systematic study of a subject 
should be given. For instance, it is difficult to teach 
grammar entirely by the project method. If we use this 
method in teaching grammar we should begin with the 
children’s mistakes in speech and teach them grammar to 
explain why the correct forms are correct. For instance, 
we might use the project method by having the children 
correct the mistake of “He don’t” for “He doesn’t.” 
This involves the rule that the verb must agree with its 
subject in person and number, but in order to understand 
this rule the children must know verbs, nouns, pronouns, 
subject and predicate, and person and number in nouns 
and verbs. In such a case it becomes absolutely neces- 
sary to teach grammar systematically by beginning with 
definitions and developing rules. Then when these 
have been learned systematically the project method may 
begin. 
Yet the project is of such great importance because it 
develops interest and uses reason and thinking, that it 
should be used as much as possible by teachers. 
Tests. If teaching is to be efficient the results of teach- 
ing must be tested. Tests have two values — the teacher

  392 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
may use them to see how successful the work of the chil- 
dren has been, or to find out where more work needs to be 
done. They have an evaluation function and a diagnostic 
function. 
During the past ten years rapid strides have been made 
in the developing of standard tests, and the technique de- 
veloped in the standard tests can also be used by teachers 
in what we have called “home-made” tests. These tests 
are worked out more fully in some subjects than in others, 
as indicated from chapter to chapter. The resourceful 
teacher will make as complete use as possible of scientifi- 
cally and carefully prepared tests to supplement the con- 
ventional testing to which he has become accustomed in 
his own school life. 
Telling vs. Development. The teacher may either tell 
the children everything or help them to think it out for 
themselves. When the children think things out for them- 
selves we say that the subject is developed rather than 
told. Developing a subject is of great help to children 
because they understand it better when they learn it and 
retain it more exactly and permanently. The develop- 
ment method should be used wherever advisable, but it is 
not advisable to use it where the thing to be learned is too 
difficult to understand. In that case, if the pupils need to 
use it, but cannot understand how it is arrived at, it should 
be told to them. For instance, if it is necessary to teach 
square root to an eighth-grade class, it is wise to show them 
how to work square root without explanation, since the 
theory is too difficult for them to understand. 
Questioning. The most important tool used in the de- 
velopment method is the question. To question well is a 
high achievement of the teacher. There are two types of 
question — the test question and the developing question, 
The purpose of the former is to find out how much children
-P-A-G-E-409
SUMMARY OF METHODS 393 
know while the purpose of the latter is to help them to do 
their own thinking. 
Test questions should lead to topical answers. In test- 
ing pupils the teacher should usually not ask a large number 
of little questions, but a smaller number of questions re- 
quiring more extensive answers. They should not exer- 
cise memory but should make the children think. In the 
questions at the end of each chapter, I have used very few 
purely memory questions but have tried to ask questions 
which will show whether or not the students understood the 
content of the chapter, while at the same time making 
them apply their knowledge in a new way. These are 
known as “thought questions.” 
In using developing questions the teacher gives hints to 
help the children. Illustrations of these may be found 
scattered through the text. 
A few devices are of use in asking questions of the class. 
It is better not to ask questions in rotation because chil-—~ 
dren will then know when their turn will come and will 
loaf in the mean time. It is better to say, “What is a noun 
— John?” than, “John, what is a noun?” for in the latter 
case the rest of the class are apt to leave the question to 
John to answer. Questions beginning with “What about” 
are poor. Generally speaking, questions answered by 
“yes” or “no” are not good because the answer is usually 
given away in the question. Leading questions from which 
the pupil may guess the answer are ineffective. For in- 
stance, the question, “Washington was the first president 
of the United States, was he not?” is poor. It is better to 
say, “Who was the first president of the United States?” 
Answers. Children should not be allowed to answer in 
concert, because the teacher cannot tell who is thinking or 
who is inattentive. Occasionally in drill work they may 
be allowed to answer in chorus, but only occasionally.
-P-A-G-E-410
394 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
Answers that are complete sentences should not always be 
insisted upon because they retard class progress and are 
not necessary. When the pupil’s answer is obscure he may 
be asked to repeat, giving a full sentence, but usually an 
incomplete sentence is satisfactory. The teacher should 
be careful not to repeat the pupil’s answers. This grows 
into a bad habit with some teachers. If the class cannot 
hear the pupil’s answer, he should be asked to repeat it and 
speak more distinctly. Correct English should be insisted 
upon in all answers where language points have been cov- 
ered up to that point by the class. 
Drill. When anything has to be used frequently it pays 
to memorize or habituate it so well that it will not be nec- 
essary to think about it whenever we want to use it. This 
can be done by drill. We have mentioned the steps in 
drill many times, but it will do no harm to summarize them 
here. The first thing that is necessary is to understand the 
item that is to be drilled upon. Psychology says that there 
must be a clear initial impression. The second thing that 
must be done is to have attentive repetition. It is not 
sufficient to repeat. When the repetition occurs the at- 
tention should be fixed firmly upon it. It pays, moreover, 
to repeat it for a short time at frequent intervals rather 
than for a long time, but infrequently, because the atten- 
tion tires easily. The third thing is to see that the item 
drilled upon is repeated until it becomes automatic. If 
one ceases the repetition before it reaches the point where 
one does not have to think about it, the labor is largely 
wasted. Fourth, the drill should be pleasant. It is almost 
impossible to form a habit if pleasure is not present, while 
it is relatively easy to form the habit if the person forming 
it enjoys the process. 
Socialization. One of the most interesting topics that 
has been developed during the past ten years is the socialized
-P-A-G-E-411
SUMMARY OF METHODS 395 
recitation. In my first edition I had trouble in finding 
many illustrations of the use of this method, but since that 
time the literature has become quite extensive. The point 
that is being sought after in work upon the socialized recita- 
tion is this— study is both an individual and a social 
matter. In the last analysis each child should be held 
responsible for a certain minimum number of facts, but 
in learning these it often happens that the children can 
learn more quickly and more effectively if they work in 
groups, particularly upon problems and projects. But 
even more important than this is the idea that the socialized 
recitation gives the children practice in working in groups, 
which is of use to them all through their lives. They have 
to work with people rather than work alone if they are 
going to be effective, and so it becomes the business of the 
school to teach them how to work together rather than 
alone. This practice can be efficiently given through 
group work. Sometimes the organization of group work 
is very elaborate and in some schools it is quite natural 
and simple. Perhaps the best guiding principle is this: 
The teacher should endeavor to teach the children the ideals 
of service and the technique of teamwork. 
Methods of Study. In rural schools, particularly, the 
pupils spend, necessarily, a great deal more time on study 
outside of the class than in the class. They receive less 
assistance from the teacher and must in consequence do 
more independent work for themselves. This, in many 
respects, is an advantage, but unless the children learn 
how to study there is a frightful waste of time. Learning 
to study can be taught only in class, because the teacher is 
busy with other classes and has little time for supervised 
study. ; 
In teaching the children how to study, care must be 
taken to set the right sort of assignment. The most diffi-
-P-A-G-E-412
  396 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
cult kind of assignment for pupils is the one most frequently 
used: Take the next four pages. This is the hardest be- 
cause the children have to find out not only what problems 
the text is attempting to solve but in addition what the 
solution is. And to many children who are given this sort 
of assignment the idea never occurs that the text is solving 
any problems. They merely memorize a mass of facts. 
This situation can be improved by the teacher if, in such 
subjects as literature, history, or geography, a few ques- 
tions (informational and thought), the answers to which 
may be found in the assigned lessons, are placed on 
the board. Sometimes such questions may be set so that 
the pupils will have to consult two or three textbooks in the 
library in order to form their answers. When assignments 
are made in more than one text rather definite page refer- 
ences in each case should be given, even though it is sur- 
prising how much pupils who are trained to do it can pick 
out of a number of books without much assistance. 
It is necessary in teaching children to study to diagnose 
each student’s difficulties. Sometimes the chief difficulty 
is lack of mental ability, but most frequently the difficul- 
ties are more specific. They may lack confidence in them- 
selves, they may not know how to memorize. They may 
not be able to pick out the important points to be learned 
in the text. They may not be able to read well. Every 
pupil who has trouble in studying his assignments should 
be diagnosed by the teacher to find out exactly what is 
wrong in order that the difficulties may be removed. 
Study lessons should be assigned so as to require a mini- 
mum of written work by the pupil. Nothing is more dead- 
ening than assignments which require constant writing. 
Outlines of lessons may be written, but greater detail 
should be required only where there is a very good and 
sufficient reason for it.
-P-A-G-E-413
SUMMARY OF METHODS 897 
In making difficult assignments it will often pay the 
teacher to take part of the time of recitation to talk over 
the lesson with the pupils and make the assignment clear, 
for while this takes some time from the short recitation, it 
must be remembered that the pupils are preparing for a 
long period of study to be used to the best advantage. 
Appreciation. In the foregoing pages of this chapter we 
have been considering methods by which the children may 
become more productive in their work. But life consists 
not only of work but of enjoyment of the work of ourselves 
and other people. This is known as appreciation. By 
appreciating our own work we mean stopping to enjoy what 
we have done. This is the fundamental reward that we 
get from effort. We work for a while and our payment is 
the pleasure that comes from the contemplation of results. 
It is very important, therefore, that appreciation of work 
accomplished should be deep. This is obtained partly 
from the teacher through ‘sincere, though sometimes ex- 
aggerated praise, and sometimes from the feeling of self- 
satisfaction. The Puritans have handed down to us the 
tradition that we should never be satisfied with ourselves, 
but a more rational view of life leads us to the position that 
it is not a weakness to praise ourselves to ourselves, and 
to seek for happiness in the things that we do. Possibly 
people who praise themselves too much may become con- 
ceited, but that can be easily taken care of by teaching 
children that courtesy and good manners demand that we 
should not talk about ourselves too much. This is a quite 
different thing from healthy enjoyment of what we are 
able to accomplish. 
In addition to this we can appreciate the work of other 
people and, particularly in school work, learn to appre- 
ciate music, literature, and art. For, as has been pointed 
out again and again, while one pupil may be able to produce
-P-A-G-E-414
398 SUMMARY OF METHODS 
good literature, music, or other forms of art, a thousand 
pupils can appreciate what others have produced. 
In the developing of this fundamental attitude of appre- 
ciation several methods have been outlined throughout the 
text. These may be summarized as follows: (1) Children 
should be made acquainted with beautiful examples of 
music, literature, painting, and sculpture. They absorb a 
good deal from its silent contemplation. (2) The teacher 
may, through suggestion, lead the children to notice and 
cultivate the beautiful while they develop a distaste for 
the ugly and cheap. (3) Problems may be set which re- 
quire the pupils to discriminate between the good and bad 
in order to solve them. (4) Discussions of reasons for 
liking and disliking pictures, poems, and music, lead the 
children to a deeper appreciation of the beautiful and (5) 
some slight training to write poetry, sing, play, and draw, 
helps to develop a deeper understanding of the beauty of 
the works which other people have created for our pleasure 
and improvement.

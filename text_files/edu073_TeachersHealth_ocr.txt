  PREFACE 
Tue importance of the subject to which the reader 
is introduced in this little volume is attested by 
the following bit of testimony from one of our 
most experienced school physicians: “In my 
experience as Medical Director of Schools,” the 
statement runs, “I have time and again observed 
teachers afflicted with tuberculosis, asthma, deaf- 
ness, defective vision, neurasthenia, malnutrition, 
anzemia, heart disease, or other disorders.” 
Similar warnings have been sounded in the last 
two decades from almost every part of the civi- 
lized world. Medical inspection of schools, which 
everywhere was instituted solely for the benefit 
of the pupil, is rapidly growing to include in its 
scope the medical examination and supervision 
of teachers as well. The latter was the inevit- 
able corollary of the former, for the health of the 
school-child is intricately related to that of the 
teacher.

PREFACE 
The purpose of this book is to summarize and 
interpret the most important investigations which 
bear upon the hygiene of the teaching profession. 
It is hoped that the findings of the brief survey 
will (1) make some contribution toward the con- 
servation of the teacher’s health by pointing out 
some of the sources of danger and by sugges- 
tions for a better personal hygiene; (2) that it will 
awaken those charged with the administration 
of our schools to the need for further investiga- 
tions and to the desirability of adopting some 
concerted plan of action designed to ameliorate 
the present rather unsatisfactory hygienic status 
of the profession.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
THERE are many factors in school efficiency 
about which we know little; the health of the 
teacher is one. For a long time many citizens 
have looked upon the teacher’s work as a sine- 
cure ; for an equally long time the teachers have 
contended that it is a life of strain and exhaus- 
tion. The value of direct experience as testimony 
should certainly carry some weight; but even 
more valuable is a presentation of the available 
scientific evidence, which Professor Terman pre- 
sents in this monograph, along with his critical 
interpretations. But one conclusion from this 
study seems possible and that is, that neither the 
profession nor the public has been sufficiently 
aware of the morbidity existing among teachers 
as a class. In consequence they both have been 
inadequately vigorous in guaranteeing that health 
of mind and body which is essential to high ef- 
fectiveness in teaching. 
Vigorous practical measures ought to be the

product of definite knowledge, and such knowl- 
edge as we have suggests that we should pursue 
six distinct policies : — 
fz) The establishment of an efficient health 
examination of candidates for entrance into pro- 
fessional training or practice. 
(2) The provision of an adequate training in 
hygiene and sanitation for all teachers. 
(3) The adoption of measures that will guar- 
antee a distribution of teachers among lines 
of work that are most congenial to personal 
temperament, training, and taste, and therefore 
less injurious to physical and mental health. 
(4) The improvement of the physical condi- 
tions of classroom life so as to approximate the 
best standards of hygiene and sanitation. 
(5) The betterment of the methods of school 
supervision and administration so that the de- 
mands of a constantly evolving school system 
shall be transmitted to the teacher with due re- 
gard to the personal equation in effective work- 
manship. 
(6) The fostering of an intelligent apprecia- 
tion on the part of the public that teachers, just

because they are in a business that is exhaust- 
ing, are entitled to a normal, restful, and recrea- 
tive personal and social life. 
It is unnecessary to argue the importance of 
all these purposes ; for the most part they ex- 
press obvious needs. It would not be necessary 
to mention them were it not for our persistent 
violation of the standards they imply. Teachers 
with communicable diseases still expose children 
to the danger of infection, and persons, too weak 
for manual labor or commercial occupations, turn 
to teaching under the delusion that they are 
equal to its demands upon their physical re- 
sources. Training schools for teachers are still 
so scornfully superior in their intellectual and 
spiritual pretensions that they fail to give their 
student-teachers a real and practicable command 
of the fundamental principles of hygiene and 
sanitation. Again, the sanitary arrangements of 
many schoolrooms, as regards heating, lighting, 
and ventilation, are far from satisfactory; this, 
too, in spite of much recent progress in our 
knowledge of what ought to be. 
It is useful, therefore, to urge the value for 
xi

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
teachers of sound physical health and wholesome 
mental attitudes. Modern teaching is not a for- 
mal and mechanical procedure, exclusively con- 
ducted through memory and habit, the twin 
economizers of human energy. It is a highly 
versatile occupation calling for alertness, tact, 
patience, persistence, judgment, and the other 
resources utilized in meeting novel situations. 
The constant solving of novel situations is pre- 
cisely the kind of activity which leads to much 
wear and tear. Physical weaklings and tired 
people are poorly fitted to represent civilization 
on the frontier of childhood where conflicts 
with law, order, and intelligence, or emergen- 
cies involving the physical safety and the men- 
tal potentialities of children, are continually 
arising. The positive value of rugged health, 
with adequate reserve energy, is not to be un- 
derestimated in a scheme of work calling for the 
degree of self-restraint and continual personal 
readjustment required in being a foster parent 
and intellectual leader to the children of forty or 
more different families. 
It is most important in this connection to em-

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
phasize the mental health of the teacher, that 
wholesome functioning of a truly social person- 
ality in the presence of impressionable youth. 
The chief conscious purpose of school life may 
be the transmission of knowledge, but it is more 
than likely that the outcome of greatest value is 
found in the wisdom garnered in the classroom 
as a by-product. And wisdom, as we have often 
been told, is more than truth; it is truth evalu- 
ated for the practical purposes of life with all its 
varying circumstances. It is just here that the 
wholesomeness or the unwholesomeness of the 
teacher’s personality enters into the efficiency of 
the school. If the teacher’s conscious pedagog- 
ical method transmits truth, it is the unconscious 
influence of his personality that gives it that 
bias of meaning which the fact will forever 
after have for the pupil. The teacher whose 
habitual mental reactions are filled with the com- 
mon sense of a world-old wisdom, true to the 
better order of things outside the school, is the 
teacher with mental health. No other teacher 
will do. The merely school-made or book-made 
instructor will be an academician, a bookworm,

accessories of a dominant interest in human life

THE PROBLEM 
In order to maintain a reasonable standard of 
health among the eighty thousand soldiers and 
sailors in its employ, our National Government 
expends annually large sums of money in pay- 
ment for expert medical and surgical attendance 
and in the prosecution of scientific researches 
bearing on military hygiene. Whether the con- 
tribution of armies and navies to the welfare of 
the world is sufficient to justify their support is, 
however, a question about which exists much 
difference of opinion. 
In the United States there are about one-half 
million public-school teachers whose combined 
efforts are molding the intellect and character of 
nearly twenty million children. These teachers 
are official bearers of the torch of civilization to 
the generations which are to follow. No one 
I
-P-A-G-E-18
    THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
doubts the value of their social contribution, or 
that the school is the most far-reaching and fun- 
damental of our public institutions. Concerning 
the health conditions obtaining among these half- 
million teachers we know, however, extremely 
little beyond what common observation teaches 
us. So far as can be learned, not a dollar of pub- 
lic money has ever been expended in the United 
States even to investigate the hygiene of school- 
teaching, to say nothing of expenditures for 
remedial measures. 
Regarding the mortality rate of teachers, in 
comparison with that of other professional work- 
ers, our knowledge is far from satisfactory ; still 
less do we know about the relative responsibility 
of the various diseases. We do not know how 
many of our teachers are partially incapacitated 
by affections of the heart, lungs, throat, diges- 
tive organs, or the nervous system. We have not 
ascertained the safe limits as to size of classes, 
number of hours of teaching duties per week, 
years of service, etc., nor have we much definite 
information relating in any way to this public- 
service profession. 
2
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE PROBLEM 
' The soldier is not accepted until he has been 
given a thorough physical examination and has 
been put through a searching inquiry as to his 
antecedents ; but the mentors of our children, as 
far as their health is concerned, are accepted 
upon the sublimest faith. We do not inquire how 
many of them are diseased on entering the pro- 
fession, how many have been subjected to over- 
strain in their professional preparation, nor how 
long the average teacher serves before health be- 
gins to deteriorate. On the other hand, the army 
statistician could doubtless inform us fairly accu- 
rately upon all matters of corresponding import 
for military affairs, including even the hygiene 
and service life of the army mule. 
The little positive knowledge we have regard- 
ing the hygiene of teaching is not especially 
reassuring. As will be shown later in detail, in- 
vestigations indicate that the teacher becomes 
superannuated at a decidedly earlier age than the 
lawyer, physician, state official, or man of busi- 
ness. Evidence will also be adduced which seems 
to warrant the belief that between a quarter and 
a half-million of our school-children are being 
J

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
daily instructed by teachers who are already 
caught in the grip of the great White Plague. It 
hardly needs to be affirmed that to permit the 
presence of a tuberculous teacher in the school- - 
room is a species of neglect which constitutes a . 
terrible menace. It will also be shown that teach- 
ers are especially subject to pathological mental 
fatigue and that probably more than a million 
of our school-children are taught by persons 
who are neurasthenic or otherwise nervously un- 
strung. 
Such figures must of course be understood as 
little more than guesses, based, as they are, upon 
fragmentary or otherwise unsatisfactory data. 
Whatever the facts, however, they should be 
thoroughly explored. There is no other occupa- 
tion or profession, the hygiene of which is so 
vitally important to the public welfare. Teaching 
at present is the chief profession open to women, 
Our women teachers equal in number the com- 
bined Federal armies of the Civil War. Apart 
from humanitarian considerations, they are a na- 
tional asset far too valuable to justify our apa- 
thetic disregard of the hygienic conditions which 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PROBLEM 
surround them, For the sake of the children, as 
well, it is a matter of the greatest consequence 
that teachers be kept at the highest possible 
level of physical, mental, and moral efficiency. 
The teacher who harbors tuberculosis and the 
teacher who dwells always in the abysses of de- 
spair and gloom or tingles with nervous hyper- 
sensitiveness are dangerous in almost equal de- 
gree. 
In proportion as society recognizes its obliga- 
tions to the teaching profession by the excellent 
practice of granting retiring allowances and sick- 
benefits the investigation of mortality and mor- 
bidity among teachers will become a recognized 
necessity. For this purpose we shall have to go 
far beyond the data usually collected for census 
purposes. Such investigation must seek to estab- 
lish a reliable body of facts on at least the fol- 
lowing points :— 
(1) The physical equipment of those entering 
the profession. Is it true, as some authorities 
maintain, that adverse selection is at work favor- 
ing the entrance into the profession of persons 
who are not sufficiently rugged to measure up to 
5  
-P-A-G-E-22
    THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
the demands of other, supposedly more arduous, 
pursuits? Is it true, as others believe, that can- 
didates for teaching are injured by overwork and 
bad hygiene during the period of their professional 
training ? 
(2) The hygienic aspects of the teacher's work 
ttself, and of the conditions under which the work 
ts done. This will include such topics as the size 
of class, the apportionment of work over the 
school-year and school-day, the length of vaca- 
tions; the influence on health of salary, tenure, 
and different methods of supervision; special 
disease tendencies, together with the underlying 
reasons therefor; and, finally, the mental and 
moral hygiene of the teacher’s work, 
In the light of such investigations teachers will 
need to be instructed not only in the general laws 
of hygiene, but especially in those aspects of per- 
sonal hygiene which pertain to their particular 
habits of living and working. The desirability of 
interesting teachers themselves in the sources of 
their ill health and in the means of its prevention 
cannot be too strongly emphasized, and in fact 
is the main justification for the present volume. 
6
-P-A-G-E-23
  
THE PROBLEM 
Special attention is called to the fact that most 
of the evils herein recounted are remediable. Had 
such not been the case the writer would not have 
risked the danger of disheartening the teacher by 
directing her attention to them. It is conceivable 
that further inquiry into the hygiene of teaching 
will appreciably affect our methods of instruction, 
our prevailing types of school architecture, and 
even assist in the accomplishment of special ed- 
ucational legislation designed to conserve the 
health of our largest and most important body of 
public servants.

MORTALITY RATE AND PHYSICAL MORBIDITY 
Tue health of teachers is a subject regarding 
which so many unsupportable assertions have 
been made that it seems advisable, even at the 
risk of taxing the reader’s patience, to set forth 
in some detail the results of the most important 
investigations which have served as the basis for 
this volume.! 
In his 1896 Report to the Board of Education, 
Superintendent T. M. Balliet, of Springfield, 
Massachusetts, summarized 159 replies to a 
“health questionnaire” which he had submitted to 
theteachers of that city. Of these, 84 percent test- 
ified that in their opinion the teacher of average 
physical constitution suffers distinct impairment 
of health within five to ten years after beginning 
service. Fifty per cent placed it under seven 
years, while only 7 per cent of the estimates ex-

ceeded ten years. The replies emphasized so uni- 
formly the intense physical strain involved in 
teaching that Superintendent Balliet was led to 
recommend the adoption of the sabbatical year. 
In 1904, Dr. W. H. Burnham (7), secured 500 
replies from teachers in two New England and 
one Middle West City in reply to the following 
question : “ What conditions in the schoolhouse or 
its surroundings and in school-instruction have 
you found injurious to your health?” Although 
the cities concerned are known to have among 
the best schools in the country, 37.4 per cent of 
the teachers stated that their health had been in- 
jured in greater or less degree by the conditions 
they had encountered in them; 10.8 per cent 
mentioned ventilation ; 9.6 per cent, bad light ; 
7.4 per cent, nervous strain ; 4 per cent, standing; 
2.8 per cent, outside noises ; 2.6 per cent, over- 
crowded classes ; 2 per cent, chalk dust; 1.4 per 
cent, too long periods of unbroken work. Of fifty- 
five teachers in Indiana rural schools who were 
asked to reply to this question, 80 per cent named 
school conditions which they believed had been 
detrimental to their health. Among both city and

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
rural teachers the illnesses most frequently men- 
tioned were indigestion, headaches, nervousness, 
constipation, irregular heart action, bronchitis, and t ie 
European investigations are more extensive, 
though still far from satisfactory. Dr. Sigel, in 
1895, examined all the teachers in Leipzig and 
found that 42.8 per cent were suffering from 
definite diseases, mostly affections of the lungs, 
heart, throat or nervous system (6). The German 
statistics of Karup and Gollmer had already 
shown a large amount of nervous, throat, and 
chest disease, and that rural teachers made the 
most unfavorable showing, presumably because 
of larger classes, heavier duties, and worse hygi- 
enic conditions (19, p. 330). Their investiga- 
tion embraces 12,381 teachers of all grades and 
classes, and in spite of a rather unfavorable show- 
ing for tuberculosis and nervous diseases, they 
found a total mortality rate for male teachers 
which compared favorably with that for males in 
all other occupations. Likewise Dr. Catherine 
Van Tussenbroek (19), reviewing all the avail- 
able data up to 1904, concludes that for male 
10
-P-A-G-E-27
PHYSICAL MORBIDITY 
teachers! in all European countries the mor- 
tality rate is probably below the average for the 
general population, though, as will be shown 
further on, the mortality from tuberculosis is 
excessive at certain age periods. 
It cannot be too strongly urged, however, that 
the significance of mortality tables, even in those 
rare cases when they can be accepted as repre- 
senting truly the facts, is not always as clear 
as could be desired. An apparently satisfactory 
showing may not be so satisfactory when it is 
analyzed. The fact is, as was long ago empha- 
sized by Arlidge (2), that teachers as a rule be- 
long to a rigidly selected class, both physically 
and morally, and ought, therefore, to show a very 
much lower mortality rate than the average for 
“males in other occupations.” The latter group 
includes the saloon-keepers, the drunkards, the 
stonecutters, the factory workers, the paupers, 
the criminals, besides all of that large class of 
persons who are ignorant alike of the causes of 
1 Unfortunately all of the important European investiga- 
tions concern male teachers only. The health conditions ob- 
taining among female teachers are still, for the most part, 
terra incognita. 
II 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
disease and of the simple laws of personal hy- 
giene. Allowance made for this, Arlidge believes 
that teaching cannot be regarded as a healthful 
occupation. Among other conditions unfavor- 
able to the teacher’s health he mentions the 
strain of school discipline, the lack of variety 
in the work, confinement indoors, an excessive 
amount of standing and an overstrenuous train- 
ing in preparation for the profession. 
After all, mortality tables are by no means.the 
final authority. Arelatively low general mortality 
is entirely compatible with a relatively high mo 
  bidity, and just this appears_to characterize the 
teaching profession. , For most diseases, excepting — 
tuberculosis, teaching is accredited with a mor- 
tality rate not above the average for the general 
population. At the same time teachers suffer with 
undue frequency from a number of complaints 
which do not appreciably affect longevity, but 
which are destructive to efficiency and to the joy 
of living. 
The most important data available on this as- 
pect of the subject are the official records, kept 
by various governments and provident societies,

The above figures are about the same as for 
previous years, except for the steady and rather 
heavy increase in influenza and chest complaints. 
Todd, to whom we are indebted for this informa- 
tion (20), concludes that. teaching. produces an_ 
excessive amount of physical morbidity. Teach- 
13       
-P-A-G-E-30
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
ers, he says, are overinspected and overworked 
in the effort to secure “ unnatural paper results.” 
In spite of the fact that the profession in England 
is safeguarded by three different medical examin- 
ations before employment begins, the mental 
strain overcomes large numbers. This is espe 
cially the case with women teachers. Without 
trying to place the blame very definitely, Todd 
emphasizes the evils of overcrowded classes, the 
unhygienic conditions of the schoolroom, and, 
most of all, the nervous strain of the work itself. 
This opinion is justified by the records of retire- 
ments under the Teachers’ Superannuation Act 
of England since 1899. The latter credits almost 
exactly one third of the breakdowns to “neuras- 
thenia,” “nervous prostration,” “nervous de- 
bility,” etc. 
Similar records for the city of Amsterdam 
(19, p. 350) show that 24.7 per cent of the 1203 
male teachers missed duty from illness during 
the year 1903, and 34.2 per cent of the gog female 
teachers. The proportion was about the same for 
the secondary as for the elementary teachers. 
Seventy-nine per cent of the illnesses lasted two 
14
-P-A-G-E-31
  PHYSICAL MORBIDITY 
weeks or less, 8.5 per cent between two and four 
weeks, and the remaining 12.5 per cent over four 
weeks. The causes of the absences were distrib- 
uted as follows : Nervous affections, 34 per cent ; 
throat and lungs, 16.5 per cent ; acute contagious 
illness, 6.5 per cent; all other causes, 43 per 
cent. 
The most valuable report yet made of teacher 
morbidity is the recent one by Dr. Stéenhoff for 
all the elementary and infant-school teachers of 
Sweden (18). In case of illness lasting one month 
or longer, Swedish teachers are entitled to special 
benefit payments, which are made upon the pre- 
sentation of medical certificates stating the ne- 
cessity for leave of absence and the nature of 
the illness responsible for it. Stéenhoff’s report 
is based upon a study of all such certificates 
issued between 1906 and 1909. The two follow- 
ing tables, which summarize his chief conclu- 
sions, represent by far the most important data 
thus far available on the hygiene of the teaching 
profession: —

  We are also informed that 2.5 per cent of the 
active teaching staff of Sweden are sufferers from 
neurasthenia of a “ pronounced mental type,” and 
that nervous disease causes 50 per cent of the 
absences lasting two years or over. The Swedish 
Tuberculosis Committee had already reported 
(1906) that 1.17 per cent of the Swedish female 
teachers zz active service, were sufferers from 
tuberculosis. It is interesting to note that except 
for the greater liability of women to anzemia and 
16
-P-A-G-E-33
  PHYSICAL MORBIDITY ' $ 
“general debility,” there are only minor sex 
differences in physical morbidity for Swedish 
teachers. At least, we can say that, of absences 
lasting one month or longer, very few are due to 
disabilities peculiar to women. 
Stéenhoff blames the following causes for the 
alarming extent of teacher morbidity in Sweden : 
(1) Poor physical endowment; (2) overstrain dur- 
ing professional preparation ; (3) bad hygienic 
conditions of schools ; (4) insufficiency of salary ; 
and (5) the indifference of teachers to the re- 
quirements of personal hygiene. Herecommends, 
accordingly, that education be given a physio- 
logical and hygienic foundation ; that candidates 
for teaching be selected more carefully; that 
school environment be made hygienic ; that sal- 
aries be increased ; that teachers should be thor- 
oughly instructed in the laws of personal hygiene; 
and that the teaching staff be represented in all 
school councils. 
If further evidence is required to demonstrate 
that teaching is not a profession suited to weak- 
lings, it can be had in the well-established fact 
that the teachers as a class become prematurely

superannuated. Before reaching that age at which 
the physician, lawyer, business man, or politician 
is at his zenith of influence, teachers who have 
not already discovered their distaste or unfitness 
for the profession and deserted it find them- 
selves looked upon as undesirables. The teacher 
may hold a position for several years after 45, 
but if at this time in life the old position is lost, 
a new one is not easily obtained ; she is looked 
upon as passée, and is always at a disadvantage 
in competition with the hopeful and enthusiastic 
girl of 20 or 22 years, newly graduated from the 
normal school. 
It is not uncommon for the city school depart- 
ments to refuse, by rule, even to consider the 
application of a candidate above the age of 45 
years, however successfully the applicant may 
have served in other positions. Unless such rules 
can be shown to rest purely upon prejudice or 
ignorance, they must be accepted as proof that 
the work of the teacher is sadly unhygienic. 
The average age for retirement on pension in 
England is 53 years for male teachers and 51 
for female (20). In Saxony, for male teachers, it 
18

is 49.1 years, and in Hesse and Bayern, 51! 
Summing up the situation for the Germ 
ondary teacher, Schroeder states that on the 
average he completes his preparation for a posi- 
tion at the age of 30 years, secures a position at 
the average age of 36, and dies or becomes su- 
perannuated before 57 (6). Only 1.8 per cent of 
the German secondary teachers in active service     Ce 
are above 65 years of age, while the proportion 
of judges is about 6 per cent. University profes- 
sors reach superannuation later than any other 
class of teachers, but even these are usually re- 
tired, under the provisions of the Carnegie Foun- 
dation, at the age of 65 years, the age when 
lawyers are commanding their highest fees and 
statesmen are making world history. 
This may help to explain why the ranks of 
teachers have to be recruited so preponderantly 
from the children of parents who have not taught. 
Parents who have spent a lifetime in the profes- 
sion are less likely than others to encourage their 
children to enter it. Schroeder showed that in 
Germany, from 1894 to 1896, 48.5 per cent of 
the lawyers were following the profession to

holds for America, though the difference may 
not be as great as in European countries, for the     
   
   
reason that with us teaching is used more often 
as a stepping-stone to other professions.

TUBERCULOSIS AND THE TEACHER 
THE excessive mortality of teachers from tuber- 
culosis and other respiratory affections appears 
to be reliably established. According to Goldhahn 
(6), this excess for the teachers of Saxony, as 
compared with the general male population, was 
approximately 60 per cent for the years 20 to 29 
and 23 per cent between 30 and 39. In the Neth- 
erlands for the years 1891 to 1895, Van Tussen- 
broek (19) finds the teacher’s mortality from tu- 
berculosis alarmingly high between the ages 25 
to 35 years, at which period it exceeded the rate 
for physicians by about 30 per cent and that for 
lawyers by over 60 per cent. For Switzerland * 
the same author finds the tuberculosis mortality 
among teachers 10 per cent higher than for the 
general population between 20 and 29 years, 
about the same from 30 to 39, but 30 per cent 
higher from 40 to 49. 
These facts become very significant when we

the selected nature of the material of 
e teaching body is composed. It would 
  ‘seem hat the strenuous training which always 
precedes the certification in European countries 
ought to eliminate in advance all candidates of 
low physical resistance. The fact that teachers 
reach their maximum mortality rate from tuber- 
culosis at least ten or fifteen years later in life 
than the general population is also highly signifi- 
cant and supports the assumption that on the 
average those who qualify for the profession 
possess more than average resistance to the dis- 
ease, and that their excess rate from tuberculosis 
between 40 and 49 years cannot be accounted 
for except on the hypothesis that it is caused by 
the peculiar nature of the teacher’s work and 
surroundings. 
A few years ago sensational statements were 
published in the newspapers of France purporting 
to show an astonishing amount of tuberculosis 
among elementary teachers in certain cities and 
districts of that country. These estimates varied 
from 20 to 33 per cent. Dr. Louis Gourichon, 
former President of the French Society of School

the prevalence of tuberculosis among th 
of Paris and the;Department of the Sei 
was undertaken forthe purpose of exposing the in- 
accuracy of such charges (8). It was found that in 
1906, of 3187 teachers in this Department, 670, or 
21 per cent, had consulted a physician for,respir- 
atory complaints. Of the latter, however, only 
about 5 per cent were found to be actually tuber- 
culous. This is almost exactly 1 per cent of the 
entire number of teachers. In 1907, according to 
the official records, almost 1 per cent of the teach- 
ers of Paris were absent from duty because of 
tuberculosis. Making what he believes to be reas- 
onable allowance for the presence at duty of a 
certain number with the disease, Dr. Gourichon 
estimates that certainly not more than 3 per cent 
of the elementary teachers of Paris are infected 
with tuberculosis. It is of course impossible to 
accept such a finding as any real vindication of 
the hygienic conditions of the profession. 
Such statistics as are available for the United 
States and Canada are even more disconcerting.

CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS 
AMONG TEACHERS 
The teacher’s excessive liability to tuberculosis 
should hardly occasion surprise, considering the 
conditions of the average school environment. 
For six to eight hours each day the teacher 
breathes an atmosphere heavily laden with irri- 
tating particles of matter, the mineral dust of 
chalk and soil, lint from the clothing of forty or 
fifty children, millions of particles of cast-off cu- 
ticle from their bodies, and foul bits of epithelial 
tissue from their respiratory passages. Tests have 
26  
-P-A-G-E-43
    
TUBERCULOSIS AND THE TEACHER 
shown that dust particles in the average school- 
room are more than a hundred times as numerous 
as in ordinary outdoor air. The number increases 
tremendously as the school-day advances. It is 
multiplied many times by a ten-minute lesson in 
calisthenics or by the children marching and 
playing in the school-room. The ventilating sys- 
tem, instead of diluting the dust by the addition 
of pure fresh air, not infrequently furnishes a 
supply of air which is already polluted. About 12 
per cent of the schoolrooms in 758 leading cities 
are not swept oftener than once in three days. 
The floors of fewer than one third of them are 
washed as often as once in three months, while 
in about six per cent of them this operation is 
wholly unknown.! The murderous feather duster 
is being gradually driven from the city school, 
but in the smaller towns and rural districts it is 
hardly yet regarded with serious suspicion. If we 
would rescue school-teaching from the list of 
dangerous occupations, it will be necessary to es- 
tablish certain standards of school sanitation, such

the Health of School-Children. Annals Am. Acad. Polit. and

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
as daily sweeping, weekly washing of floors, the 
use of dustless floor dressings, oil brushes, damp- 
ened cloths for dusting, sanitary cloak-rooms, 
screened intakes, etc. 
But the school dust, irritating as it is to the 
delicate passages of the nose, throat, and lungs, 
is probably less injurious than the high tempera- 
ture and the abnormally low humidity and the 
stagnation of the average school atmosphere. 
When outside air of 30° or 40° and of ordinary 
humidity is heated to 70° or 75°, its capacity for 
water vapor is enormously increased. Such air is 
ravenously water-hungry. In fact, tests with the 
hygrometer usually reveal a relative humidity in 
schoolroom air of 25 to 30 per cent. It is drier, 
therefore, than the winds of the Sahara Desert. 
It licks up every available atom of moisture from 
every source, — from the furniture, which 
promptly falls to pieces, and from the skin and 
respiratory passages of the persons unfortunate 
enough to have to breathe it. The nasal passages, 
one function of which is to moisten the air before it 
reaches the lungs and thus to facilitate osmosis, 
are overworked. The lining of nose, throat, and 
28

TUBERCULOSIS AND THE TEACHER 
Jungs becomes parched and irritated, producing 
chroni al and bronchial catarrh. 
Agai hat is stagnant, overheated, and of 
low humidity paralyzes the body’s heat-regulating 
mechanism and predisposes one to colds and to 
influenza. Vaso-motor control of the circulatory 
system and the central control of heat production 
demand for their normal functioning the stimu- 
lus of cool, fairly humid atr, in motion. It is the 
lack of one or more of these qualities that contri- 
butes most to the unhealthfulness of schoolroom 
air, not the accumulation of carbon dioxide as 
was once believed. 
The only way to maintain the teacher’s power 
of physical resistance at the normal level is to 
supply her workshop with an abundance of fresh 
air which has not been overheated and robbed 
of its humidity. There are systems of heating 
and ventilating apparatus which will accomplish 
this result, but most of those in actual use fall 
lamentably short of this ideal.? The absence of a

satisfactory method of artificial, véritilation can 
be largely atoned for by the ‘proper’ ’ f win- 
dows and doors. These sHouldsbe.o ned wide, 
for a few minutes at least, every ‘fot of the day. 
The common practice of sweeping and dusting 
with windows closed ought not to be tolerated. 
It is often necessary for the teacher to use every 
argumentative resource in educating the school 
board and school janitors toa proper understand- 
ing of the importance of ventilation and the care 
of the school-building. The teacher should re- 
member that in asserting her rights in such mat- 
ters she is protecting not only her own health, 
but that of her pupils as well. 
For the sake of teachers hardly less than that 
of pupils, open-air schools should be multiplied. 
The latter have been shown to have a remarka- 
ble effect in increasing the percentage of haeemo- 
globin andthe number of red corpuscles in the 
child’s blood, and would certainly do as much for 
the anzemic teacher. In making such blood tests 
the school physician would do well, in many cases 
at least, to include the teacher in his exami- 
nations.

  TUBERCULOSIS AND THE TEACHER 
Fin acher herself has a very positive 
part would escape the danger 
inci nd sedentary life. If she 
reckl s, if she does not look care- 
fully to her diet and her sleep, if she does not 
spend one or two hours every day in wholesome 
exercise out of doors, then she cannot justly 
blame the school for any form of ill health to 
which she may fall a victim. 
At the same time, the state cannot evade its 
share of the responsibility. Fortunately, economy 
and safety lie in the same direction. To employ 
a sickly, anaemic teacher is both a poor form of 
charity anda doubtful favor to the one employed. 
State legislation will have to be invoked for the 
protection of all parties concerned. Denmark’s 
Tuberculosis Act of 1905 is a praiseworthy ex- 
ample of this kind of legislation. It requires all 
candidates for the teaching profession, to take a 
special examination for tuberculosis before em- 
ployment begins and an additional examination 
at each reappointment. Teachers in service who 
contract the disease are retired on a liberal pen- 
sion or given a long leave of absence on part pay

It is well to emphasize t! sory 
medical inspection of teachers here advocated 
does not have as its aim the heartless elimina- 
tion from the profession of all who are physically 
below normal. While occasionally preventing an 
unfit candidate from entering the profession, such 
a system will, by the timely discovery of incipi- 
ent disease, and by personal instruction as to the 
care of the health, contribute in a positive way 
to the conservation of the teaching force.

Tue neurasthenic teacher is a familiar picture to 
us all: the drawn face and knitted brow; the 
“bottled lightning ” features; the loud, rasping 
voice, querulous or gushing instability, et cetera. 
These are the exterior decorations. Search deeper 
and we uncover some or all of the traditional 
mental furnishings of the neurasthenic house- 
hold, — nervous headaches, disturbed sleep, func- 
tional irregularity of the heart, anxiety states, 
hypersensitiveness, fixed ideas, and the feelings 
of lamentable insufficiency. 
As to the teacher’s excessive liability to abnor- 
mal states of mental exhaustion there seems to 
be absolute unanimity of opinion among all who 
have really investigated the question, though the 
actual proportion of nervous wrecks in our teach- 
ing force cannot, of course, be stated. Consider-

which the disease may exist, perhaps figures, after

ference upon the large numbe 
which have come to him as a result of lectures 
delivered before teachers on this subject, the 
writer believes that not even school superinten- 
dents and boards of education realize the terrible 
strain under which teachers occasionally work. 
From the average citizen, who as a matter of 
course looks with undisguised envy upon the 
six-hour day, the free Saturday, and the long 
surnmer vacation of the “ fortunate teacher,” no 
sympathy need be expected. 
Of 116 English teachers who replied to a ques- 
tionnaire of Francis Galton, 23 had suffered a 
nervous breakdown, from the effects of which 21 
thought they would never recover. Similar evi- 
dence from the questionnaires of Balliet and 
Burnham has already been cited. Medical writers 
on neurasthenia have long recognized the teacher 
as among the most frequent victims of the dis- 
ease} 
* See, for example, the German texts by Biswanger, Die

The most suggestive study in this connection 
is that alph Wichmann, who has given 
us an a ! complete analysis of 305 replies 
toa questionnaire which he submitted to German 
teachers (21). The questionnaire asked for infor- 
mation regarding heredity, health at all periods 
of life (particularly during the period of state 
examinations preparatory to entering the profes- 
sion), size of classes, amount of private instruc- 
tion carried on, extent of fatigue suffered, ner- 
vous symptoms, heart, lung, throat, and other 
diseases. Of the 305 men who replied, only 46, 
or 15 per cent, were entirely well. The 85 per 
cent who were ill mentioned the following dis- 
eases, presented here in the order of their fre- 
quency :— Nervous troubles, 78 per cent; ear, 
nose, and throat, 23 per cent ; chronic lung dis- 
ease, 7 per cent ; infectious diseases, 27 per cent ; 
digestive troubles, 14 per cent; organic heart 
disease, 3 per cent ; miscellaneous, 9 per cent.

degree of neurasthenia suffered f the fol- 
lowing nervous symptoms: mi iety and 
worry, 45 per cent; obsessions, deas, 35 
per cent ; headaches, 71 per cent; ‘heart palpita- 
tion, 58 per cent; from a@// the above nervous 
symptoms, 17 per cent. 
Wichmann’s results are extremely suggestive 
and present many striking descriptions of indi- 
vidual cases of overstrain, but they will be mis- 
leading unless the reader bears in mind that in 
all probability the figures do not represent aver 
age conditions in the profession. The teachers 
answering his questionnaire were only a fraction 
of the number to whom it was sent, and we have 
no means of ascertaining the health conditions 
of those who did not reply. Those who did take 
the trouble to do so probably included a dispro- 
portionate number of sufferers. 
It is at least comforting to know that actual 
insanity is little if any more prevalent among 
teachers than among other classes of people. 
Van Tussenbroek, after patiently ransacking all 
available lunacy statistics from the public and 
private hospitals of Germany, Switzerland, and 
36
-P-A-G-E-53
    THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
Holland, has come definitely to the conclusion 
that teachingsdoes not especially predispose to 
insanity, stilere is but slight and scattering 
evidence to dispute this. Likewise the suicide 
rate of teachers is not above the normal for the 
population in general. The teacher escapes these 
extreme evils to fall prey to a chronic state of 
nervous exhaustion which in its pathological na- 
ture is not immediately related to any of the 
neuroses of insanity. 
CAUSES AND PREVENTION 
The assumption sometimes made that teachers 
are more than ordinarily predisposed to the neu- 
roses by fault of hereditary endowment seems 
hardly justified by the known facts. Our teach- 
ers come mostly from the healthy middle classes 
which have escaped both the degenerating effects 
of luxury and the dwarfing influences of extreme 
poverty. From the tabulated replies given in 
answer to his question regarding hereditary an-

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
tecedents, Wichmann concludes. that in at least 
76 per cent of his neurasthenics a“ could be 
no question of hereditary predisposition. Instead, 
he traces the eis, chiefly to the follow- 
ing three factors : (1) The nervous strain incident 
to the state examinations for certification. )These 
in Germany extend over several months and are 
very difficult. Seventeen per cent date the be- 
ginning of their nervous symptoms at the exam- 
ination period. (2) Private instruction outside of 
school hours, which seemed to be a factor with 
fifty per cent of the cases. German teachers, like 
our own, are poorly paid, and much more gener- 
ally than our own resort to private instruction to 
help piece out a comfortable living. Often the 
" private instruction amounts to fifteen or twenty 
hours per week, (3) Overcrowded classes. Eighty 
per cent of Wichmann’s patients were teaching 
classes of more than sixty pupils. Balliet’s re- 
turns testified in similar strain to the fatiguing 
effects of the overcrowded class. It appears that 
as the number of pupils in a room passes beyond 
acertain point the strain upon the teacher in- 
creases somewhat in the manner of a geometric 
38
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
ratio. Both the hygienic and pedagogical safety 
limit lies probably not far above thirty pupils per 
teacher. te 
Wichmann’s inventory of causes is by no 
means complete. Perhaps there is no one provi- 
sion which would lighten the burden of teachers 
more than a thoroughgoing system of segregation 
of exceptional children. The presence of two or 
three incorrigibles in a class of forty normal 
children easily doubles the strain on the teach- 
er’s nerves. What teacher does not recall the 
heaven of bliss that followed upon the removal 
of the school’s evil genius ? The backward pupil 
also contributes his share to the worries of the 
conscientious teacher. To retain such pupils in 
the regular classroom is an unadulterated evil for 
everybody concerned, —for the pupils themselves 
no less than for the teacher. The latter cannot 
meet their needs except at the expense of the 
majority of normal children who have the first 
claims upon her time and energy. The teacher 
can hardly be blamed for the quite general ne- 
glect and misunderstanding of atypical children. 
These will not be understood or properly edu-

cated until they are universally segregated in 
small special classes where they can be instructed 
in a course of study suited to their peculiar in- 
terests and abilities by a teacher whose peda- 
gogical training has fitted her to understand and 
deal with them. 
Again, many teachers are overburdened by 
mere quantity of work apart from any of its dis- 
agreeable features. The teacher’s “short day” is 
more apparent than real, as many a beginner is 
surprised to discover. As a matter of fact, duty 
begins at least thirty to fifty minutes before the 
class is assembled, and continues almost without 
interruption until long after the close of the after- 
noon session. The teacher who can manage to 
limit her school-day to seven hours, exclusive of 
evening work, may consider herself fortunate. 
Under all but exceptional conditions evening les- 
sons will consume one or two hours additional. 
The average working-day for the teacher is there- 
fore no shorter than the recognized standard day 
for physical laborers. Sometimes it is consider- 
ably longer. The writer has known many teach- 
ers whose day of mental labor stretched, with 
40

THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
only brief intermission, from eight o’clock in the 
morning to eleven or twelve at night. 
The main argument, however, relates to the 
peculiarly exhausting nature of the work rather 
than to its gross quantity. The teacher works 
always under full steam. She is hardly permitted 
a moment of quiet concentration, but instead 
must constantly strive to apportion her attention 
to satisfy a number of simultaneous demands 
upon it. While hearing the recitation of one group 
of pupils, she must maintain order and industry 
among another group. The recitation itself in- 
volves severe mental strain whenever it is char- 
acterized by a genuine give-and-take relation be- 
tween teacher and class, and when it avoids the 
mechanical routine of a predetermined, schema- 
tized, question-and-answer procedure. Every 
question must be adapted to the class situation 
as it varies and shifts from moment to moment. 
The teacher must scent the implications of each 
reaction she elicits from her pupils and must util- 
ize these implications almost instantaneously in 
shaping those parts of the recitation which are to 
follow. While receiving an answer to her last

question she must decide upon the next one to 
ask. At the same time she must at every point be 
vaguely conscious of the directing purpose of the 
recitation and must evolve every step in the light 
of this purpose. With yet other fragments of her 
attention she must look out for grammatical er- 
rors, for the passing of time, for the maneuvers 
of mischief-makers in the rear, for requests to 
leave the room, and for other things impossible 
to foresee or enumerate. 
To work with ease and effectiveness it is neces- 
sary to concentrate. Thisteachers are not permit- 
ted to do. Psychological experimentation shows 
the extreme difficulty of carrying on simultaneous 
mental processes, such as committing poetry to 
memory while engaged in arithmetical computa- 
tions, etc. ; and processes regarded as simultane- 
ous are usually found on psychological analysis to 
be carried on in rapid alternation. The teacher’s 
attention, therefore, must shift with lightning 
speed from one to another aspect of her work. 
Psychopathology teaches that this delicate ad- 
justment to finely discriminated requirements of 
concrete situations is the most difficult task which 
42

THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
the mind is ever called upon to perform, a far 
severer requirement than is imposed by the de- 
mands of abstract thinking. This is proved con- 
clusively by the fact that in all typical forms of 
mental degeneration, such as characterizes pare- 
sis, abnormal chronic fatigue, old age, etc., the 
knack of instantaneous adjustment to a novel 
situation suffers impairment before the power of 
logical consecutive thinking has been appreciably 
disturbed. Mental decay proceeds from above 
downward, and the first onslaught of nervous fa- 
tigue in the teacher renders her efforts less effi- 
cacious and at the same time immeasurably more 
difficult and trying. 
The teacher’s desk is seldom quite clear. Re- 
cesses and the noon hour permit little actual rest. 
Every day brings its quota of papers to examine 
and lessons to prepare. It is estimated that the 
average elementary teacher corrects from 6000 to 
12,000 papers in the course of a school-year. The 
teacher of English, foreign language, or history 
in the high school performs an equivalent amount 
of work on papers which are fewer in number but 
of greater average length. Important records

must be kept with conscientious care. There are 
  parents to consult, teachers’ conferences to at- 
tend, and incorrigible or defective pupils to worry 
over. If her school is medically inspected but 
lacking the blessed services of the school nurse, 
the teacher must take upon herself the tedious 
follow-up duties of the latter, and the pupils are 
fortunate if their arithmetic instruction does not 
suffer while she is planning new arguments to 
convince parents that adenoids and enlarged ton- 
sils ought to be removed. 
Both because of the peculiar strain of the teach- 
er’s work and because of the multiplicity of duties 
which must constantly be kept in mind, it is 
misleading to think of her work-day at all in terms 
of hours. Wagner is not far wrong (13) when he 
estimates one hour of teaching as equivalent, 
from the standpoint of fatigue, to two hours of 
ordinary study done in quiet without the neces- 
sity of speaking. Four hours of actual teaching 
thus represent about eight hours of ordinary work. 
Add to this two hours for correcting papers, pre- 
paring lesson plans, supervising games, etc., and 
the four-hour day has grown to one of ten. 
44
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
The belief that the “fatigue coefficient” of 
teaching is about twice as great as that for most 
other kinds of mental work probably comes much 
nearer the truth than the usual’assumption that 
an hour always equals an hour. If we can accept 
this standard as even approximately correct we 
are forced to the opinion that many of our teach- 
ers are unmercifully sweated. No milder term 
does justice to the case when, as is not uncom- 
mon, the teacher gives instruction for six or seven 
fifty-minute periods daily, in addition to discharg- 
ing the usual round of extra duties requiring two 
or three hours additional. Is not this the equiv- 
alent of at least twelve hours of work in the quiet 
seclusion of office or study ? 
The standard for the secondary schools of 
Germany is twenty to twenty-four fifty-minute 
periods of actual class instruction per week, or 
four to five periods per day. This standard pre- 
vails by law. Reasonable as it may look to the 
strenuous American teacher, the German teach- 
ers consider it productive of overpressure and 
are endeavoring to bring about a reduction of 
the standard to fifteen or eighteen periods per

week.! The weekly schedule for the teacher in 
American normal schools varies from a minimum 
of fifteen to a maximum of thirty-five or forty 
hours. The writer knows from experience that 
more than the above minimum is overpres- 
sure, provided the classes are fairly large and 
the out-of-class duties are not neglected. Our 
college and university professors give instruc- 
tion all the way from five to twenty-five hours 
per week ; the average for the middle grade col- 
lege probably lies between fifteen and twenty 
hours, for the best universities, not far from ten 
hours. 
But hour standards should always be relative 
to the nature of the instruction. Certain kinds 
of routine teaching would be best measured in 
foot pounds of vocal energy,— though even the 
mechanical operation of the speech organs is fa- 
tiguing. On the other hand, whenever the instruc- 
tion is of akind which demands creative thinking 
or extended collateral work of scientific nature, 
* It may be noted also that in many of the German second- 
ary schools the afternoon session is dispensed with, thus giv- 
ing both teacher and pupils more opportunity for outdoor 
exercise. 
46
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
the attempt to measure it by the application of 
any mechanical, theoretical standard reduces to 
absurdity. The hardest-worked college professor 
may not meet more than two or three classes 
per week, and there are college drones who teach 
twenty classes. 
It is almost inconceivable that anyone should 
have taken seriously the recent proposal of an 
“ efficiency engineer,” relative to the uit hour 
as a gauge of the college professor’s output. 
The wnit hour is defined as one hour of in- 
struction given to one student. By this brilliant 
device the professor’s productiveness, in the in- 
dustrial sense, becomes the readily calculable 
product of the two factors : (1) number of teach- 
ing hours and (2) size of classes.1 In any kind of 
teaching, the more numerous the hours of in- 
struction the more mechanically and superficially 
this will be done. Under the pressure of a thirty- 
hour teaching program our high-school teachers 
degenerate to the plane of lesson-setting and 
lesson-hearing, which is one of the most charac-

teristic traits of American teachers as compared 
with those of Germany.! 
It is emotional overstrain, even more than in- 
tellectual, which is responsible for the overpres- 
sure of teachers. Authorities are agreed that 
strong emotion is decidedly more fatiguing than 
abstract thinking. The well-known ergographic 
researches of Mosso,? on this point have been 
lately confirmed by the new eye-test determina- 
tion of fatigue by Bauer (4). Many a teacher is 
haunted constantly by a vague fear of unpleasant 
conflicts with parents, pupils, or the higher school 
authorities. The American teacher is less an 
autocrat, and the American pupil less a marion- 
ette, than is the case in European countries, 
where, as a rule, the teacher is little exposed to 
the shafts of disagreeable criticism on the part of 
the public. Most trying of all is the necessity of 
working under a school administrative régime 
which hedges the teacher about with unnatural 
restraints and destroys her individuality.

  THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
The teacher’s lack of opportunity for self- 
objectification cuts her off from one of the most 
important motivating influences known. It is 
always invigorating to see the results of our work 
become immediately manifest in tangible form. 
When this is possible, the barriers of fatigue are 
pushed farther away. But the essential results of 
the teacher’s labors do not appear for many years, 
and even then they are so intermingled with 
other strands of social and environmental influ- 
ences working simultaneously upon the pupil that 
they cannot be weighed or identified with abso- 
lute certainty. Consequently feelings of insuffi- 
ciency and self-dissatisfaction ensue. In the figure 
of Van Tussenbroek the teacher half-consciously 
thinks of herself as a wheel, rotating always upon 
the same axis, never advancing. 
The investigations prove that it is the begin- 
ning teacher who runs the greatest risk of pa- 
thological nervous exhaustion. With forty-seven 
per cent of Wichmann’s neurasthenics the nerv- 
ous troubles appeared in less than five years, and 
within fifteen years for eighty-seven per cent. 
The reason is probably threefold: (1) the new 
49
-P-A-G-E-66
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
  teacher is more prodigal of energy from excess 
of enthusiasm and because she has not learned 
the necessity of mental economy ; (2) she lacks 
the experience which would enable her to work 
with the least expenditure of effort ; and (3) the 
early years act as a sieve to eliminate all but the 
strongest. Whatever the relative share of these 
factors, it should be understood that the first 
years of employment are critical for the teacher's 
health, To ignore the laws of physical or mental 
hygiene at this period is to sow the seeds of life- 
long nervous affliction and premature superan- 
nuation. School administrators can aid in avert- 
ing this danger by lightening-the burdens of the 
young teacher, by instructing her in economical 
methods of work, and still more by patient sym- 
pathy, kindly criticism, and frequent encourage- 
ment. : 
If society would have for the teachers of its 
children men and women of good native endow- 
ment and if it would keep these at a high level 
of professional efficiency, it will be necessary to 
increase the salaries and to improve the tenure. 
We are rather too much inclined to boast of our 
50
-P-A-G-E-67
THE TEACHER AS NEURASTHENIC 
“Javish” educational expenditures. There is no 
good reason why they should not be two or three 
times as great as they actually are! One hun- 
dred and fifty to two hundred dollars is not a very 
lavish expenditure for the child’s eight years of 
instruction in the grades, nor is four hundred and 
fifty dollars a very princely sum to represent the 
average salary for the American school-teacher. 
Remembering that a very large proportion of our 
public-school teachers have other persons de- 
pendent on them, and that the plain necessities 
of life cost the family of average size in our 
larger American cities about eight hundred dol- 
lars per year, it is superfluous to argue the case 
of the teacher any further. 
Until conditions are improved along this line, 
it will be impossible either to secure the best 
raw material for the rank and file of the profes- 
sion or to make the most of the material which 
now is available. At present the financial status 
of the American teacher is as little conducive to 
physical efficiency as it is to soul expansion.

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
The superintendent and board of education 
should consider themselves no less responsible 
for the health of the teachers than for that of 
the pupils. They cannot absolve themselves from 
moral guilt when a teacher’s health is shattered 
by causes lying in their power of prevention. The 
heartlessness with which teachers who have worn 
themselves out or have become ill in the public 
service are turned out to subsist upon the 
charity of friends or society deserves the sharpest 
condemnation. Now that our “soulless ” corpora- 
tions have long since abandoned this inhuman 
practice, it would be fitting for the virtuous 
public to emulate their example. 
Finally, the teacher herself may-accomplish 
something toward the amelioration of her en- 
vironment. In self-defense, if for no other reason, 
she should always be found an advocate of meas- 
ures pertaining to the hygiene of the school. 
She should make herself heard on all questions 
of ventilation, lighting, size of classrooms, num- 
ber of pupils per teacher, classification of pupils 
according to ability and the segregation of defect- 
ives and incorrigibles. She should guard her

THE MARGIN OF SAFETY 
In recent years it has become generally recog- 
nized that every normal person is possessed of 
stores of energy which he does not habitually 
draw upon, and even the existence of which he 
does not ordinarily suspect. As set forth in the 
brilliant essay of | Professor William James.! 
‘Fatigue gets worse up to a certain critical point, 
when gradually or suddenly it passes away, and 
, we are fresher than before.” James considers this 
the mental counterpart of the physiological phe- 
nomenon of “second wind,” and believes that it 
demonstrates the existence of several “levels of 
energy,” deeper and deeper strata of “‘combusti- 
ble or explosive material” which may be tapped 
“layer after layer.” The inference is that we hab- 
itually live too near the surface : that “ we ener-

‘ gize below our maximum”; that “we have con- 
tracted the habit of inferiority to our real self” ; 
that we live as if “our fires were damped” and 
“our drafts checked” ; in a word, bankrupt in 
the midst of plenty. 
That such a reserve of energy actually exists 
is borne out by all the known facts relating to 
the physiology and psychology of fatigue states. 
But to assume, as some have done, that the ex- 
penditure of energy may be pushed to the extreme 
limit and the pace kept up without injury is 
unnecessary and unwarranted. We may be reas- 
onably sure, if there is a margin of power not 
habitually used, that its existence is necessary 
as a margin, that it is a Factor of Safety devel- 
oped to meet exigencies. 
In truth this factor of safety is a principle 
which is a familiar phenomenon everywhere in 
biology and physiology. Wherever we look we 
find that nature preserves a fine balance between 
extravagance on the one hand and unsafe econ- 
omy on the other. The factor of safety is in 
evidence in almost every structure of the human 
body. We have two kidneys, but one, or even

two thirds of each, may be removed with impun- 
ity so long as the remaining portions remain sound. 
There are two vagi nerves to control respiration, 
whereas, under ordinary circumstances, either 
does the work perfectly. One sixth of a healthy 
thyroid gland is sufficient, but the pitiable condi- 
tion of cretinism, caused by the entire absence 
of the thyroid, proves the higher economy in so 
wide a margin. One half of the liver and nine 
tenths of the pancreas have been demonstrated 
to represent factors of safety; likewise one half 
of the digestive ferments. That the factor of 
safety in “vital capacity” is at least two is 
proved by the fact that rabbits have survived the 
excision of one half their lung tissue without de- 
terioration of health as long as other organs and 
functions remained intact. Almost every organ 
carries this form of insurance, and in general it 
may be stated that the more vital the structure, 
or the more precarious its functioning, the larger 
the factor of safety allowed. 
Nature’s rule of allowance for a reserve works 
so well that engineers have seen fit to copy it. 
The practice in engineering construction is to

-P-A-G-E-73
  THE MARGIN OF SAFETY 
build boilers, bridges, steel reinforcements, etc., 
capable of withstanding a strain six to ten times 
as great as they will ever be called upon to bear. 
That is to say, the factor of safety allowed is 
usually between six and ten. 
The lesson for mental economy to be gained 
from such facts is patent. Instead of counseling 
us to probe habitually and intentionally for 
“ deeper levels of strata,” it teaches us rather to 
preserve them inviolate for extraordinary emer- 
gencies. Instead of exploring the uttermost limit 
of our capabilities and living under its very 
shadow, we shall be wiser to consider that limit 
a dead line. For the intellectual worker to try to 
get along without a margin of safety is as unsafe 
as it is for a bank to dispense with its cash 
reserve. Or rather more so, for the bank in emer- 
gency may secure temporary credit from its 
fellow institutions ; but credit does not figure in 
the economy of nature. 
That our civilization is already too strenuous 
is a belief voiced by our leading physicians,

alienists, and educators. Nervous diseases of all 
kinds appear to be on the increase. There is a 
host of ailments whose close dependence upon 
nervous disorders physicians have only recently 
recognized. Some authorities impute to wide- 
spread nervous exhaustion the increase in di- 
gestive disturbances, eye-strain, dental caries, 
“hay fever,” and many other symptoms of what 
many have chosen to call racial degeneracy. Noth- 
ing reveals nervous weakness as surely as the cru- 
cial nodes in physical development, such as second 
dentition, puberty, and the menopause ; and an- 
thropologists tell us that these, as well as partu- 
rition, nursing, and the diseases peculiar to 
women, are becoming more critical as “ civiliza- 
tion ” advances. 
Little wonder. The nervous system has been 
granted no respite to strengthen itself for the 
countless burdens newly placed upon it. Our 
specialization of industry, robbing work of the 
variety which gives rest ; the increasing necessity 
for punctuality and economy of time; the light- 
ning-like spread and assimilation of new ideas; 
the growing magnitude of every person’s world ;

the more frequent occasion for domestic and 
financial troubles, coupled with the cruel neces- 
sity of emotional repression to suit the nervous 
fastidiousness of society; the omnipresent spirit 
of individualism, keenest in America where 
freedom emboldens the humblest born to aspire 
to the seats of power ; these, together, constitute 
an ensemble of conditions which have placed a 
higher premium upon personal hygiene and men- 
tal economy than ever existed before. 
It would be interesting if we could calculate 
the waste of energy and the inefficiency due 
to lack of knowledge of the most economical 
methods of running the human psychophysical 
machine. No one will ever know the extent of 
this loss, but it has been estimated by wise 
hygienists at not less than twenty-five to fifty 
per cent of the entire possible output. It is incum- 
bent upon anyone who would keep his mind and 
body at the level of efficiency on which they 
were meant to function to study not only the 
general laws of mental hygiene, but the special 
peculiarities of his own case as well. There is 
nothing in which people differ more than in the

true economical limits of a day’s work. That 
there are rare individuals who-appear to thrive 
on a diet of fourteen hours of mental work and 
six hours of sleep is no intimation that the rest 
of us should follow their example any more than 
we should emulate the “strong men” of the cir- 
cus who take their exercise with dumb bells 
weighing three hundred pounds. The nervous 
system may be geared for any length of work- 
day, from two to sixteen hours. Darwin could 
work only about three hours per day ; Herbert 
Spencer, four; Emmanuel Kant, six. A more 
bountiful Providence granted to Thomas A. 
Edison, also to the late President Harper, of 
Chicago University, a sixteen-hour nervous sys- 
tem. The daily limit for one of the wisest and 
most scholarly college professors known to the 
writer is about six hours ; that for the stupidest 
of his acquaintances approximates twelve hours, 
There is no known correlation, either positive or 
negative, between intellectual productiveness

the yard. The proper thing to do is to find the 
optimum limit for you, and then abide within it. 
The danger for the ambitious and conscientious 
teacher lies always on the side of shortsighted 
prodigality of energy. Where one teacher under- 
works and oversleeps there are scores who are 
addicted to “pillow thinking” and overwork, 
While general statements in such matters can 
never have more than suggestive value, it is safe 
to say that there are probably few persons who 
can profit permanently by more than one hour 
daily of professional work in addition to the six 
which must necessarily be served in the school- 
room. Books on school management (written by 
pious professors of pedagogy who teach one or 
two hours daily), solemnly counseling teachers to 
spend at least two hours in evening preparation 
of details for the morrow’s lessons, cannot be too 
strongly condemned. At least for the elementary 
teacher, a half-hour of this kind of preparation, 
followed by an hour or two of general reading or 
the pursuit of some hobby in art, literature, or 
science, would be infinitely preferable to the cul- 
tivation of such narrowing pedagogical pedantries. 
61
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
The traditional caricatures of the teacher are 
but a composite photograph of the symptoms of 
ill health and fatigue : irritability, nervous dis- 
traction, dogmatism, strident voice, superficial 
demonstrativeness, indulgent solicitude, etc. Ac- 
cordingly, if the teacher would attain either 
sanity or success, she must skill herself in the 
economy of nervous energy. Teacher personality, 
which all agree is so indispensable, however dif- 
ferently we may define it, is very largely teacher 
vitality. As health deteriorates, the teacher be- 
comes either overcritical, unsympathetic, and 
less human or else apathetic and dull ; discipline 
takes wing ; teaching becomes a labor whose sole 
reward is the material support of a wretched and 
fruitless existence. 
Sleepiness and the feeling of fatigue are the 
twin guardians of the Factor of Safety. Both 
give timely warning that the danger point is 
ahead ; but their protests unheeded, they finally 
stand aside and let us pass on. Their function is 
anticipatory. As Claparéde has so well stated it, 
we sleep not because we have actually become 
exhausted, but in order that we may not be re- 
62
-P-A-G-E-79
THE MARGIN OF SAFETY 
duced to that extremity. To reduce the hours of 
sleep from nine to seven, or from eight to six, 
may rob us by imperceptible degrees of just this 
margin of safety. Of 346 normal-school students, 
mostly from eighteen to twenty-two years of age, 
who were asked by the writer to state the num- 
ber of hours of sleep with which they could do 
their best mental work, ninety-two per cent placed 
the limit above eight hours. Almost exactly the 
same testimony was given by 110 women in col- 
lege, though a majority of college men estimated 
their sleep requirements not above eight hours. 
It is safe to say that for teachers, at any rate, 
danger lies less in excess of sleep than in its 
deficiency. 
If the teacher is a victim of insomnia, or if her 
sleep is habitually disturbed by nightmares and 
anxiety dreams, let her remember that these are 
not disease entities in themselves, but rather 
symptoms of some more general nervous disorder. 
The cause is usually to be sought in a chronic 
state of exhaustion brought on by overwork, 
grief, worry, eye-strain, constipation, or neglect 
of diet, exercise, etc., or by many of these factors

aspects of personal hygiene which are of special

SAVING THE EYES 
The biological study of the human eye teaches 
that it was not made for the kind of work 
teachers and students have to do. Always, until 
a few generations ago, the eye was permitted to 
roam in comparative freedom. The number of 
its movements perhaps rarely exceeded twenty or 
thirty per minute. But the invention of Guten- 
berg, with its consequent development of educa- 
tional ideals and facilities, has harnessed the eye

to the wearying treadmill of the printed page. 
Working at this unnatural task it must accom- 
plish from one hundred to one hundred and fifty 
separate movements and fixations per minute. 
It has not had time to adjust itself to the new 
demands upon it, and by hastening overmuch its 
domestication we threaten it with degeneracy. 
Due to the nature of their work, defective 
vision is more common among teachers than 
among any other class of people. In Germany 
about thirty-five per cent of the teachers wear 
glasses ; though in the United States probably 
not more than fifteen to twenty-five per cent. 
The difference is largely if not wholly explained 
by the unwillingness of our women teachers to 
risk the disfigurement of spectacles. Conse- 
quently many of them are chronic sufferers from 
relievable eye-strain. For such teachers the eyes 
are the “weak link” bringing misfortune to 
their best directed endeavors. Z 
It is unnecessary to set forth at length the 
part played by eye-strain in the production of 
headaches, insomnia, and other nervous symp- 
toms. The evil of eye-strain is, physiologically, a 
66
-P-A-G-E-83
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE TEACHER . 
double one; it dissipates the store of nervous 
energy while at the same time disturbing the re- 
flex nervous control of complex vital functions, 
such as digestion, circulation, etc. Severe eye- 
strain may entail profound derangements of the 
nutritive and excretory functions and thus in an 
indirect way lay the foundation for ill health of 
«almost every description. The entire body can 
be fatigued by the overwork of the minute muscles 
which accommodate or converge the eyes. The 
teacher who permits her nervous energy to be 
drained off in this (usually) needless way can 
devote to her work only the dregs that remain. 
Nor does the significance of eye-strain among 
teachers lie merely in the discomfort it produces 
or in the daily and hourly handicap it offers to 
psychophysical efficiency. Eye-strain is a symp- 
tom as well as a cause, and often serves as a 
delicate barometer, or health indicator, for the 
entire physical machine. As long as energy is 
abundant, minor errors of refraction are automat- 
ically corrected without bringing about nervous 
bankruptcy. When the reserve of energy neces- 
sary for this correction is lacking, the slightest

visual defect may register its complaints in the 
most diverse and incredible symptoms. The ab- 
normal frequency of eye-strain among teachers 
thus affords evidence of the wide prevalence of 
professional overstrain. 
Teachers should make themselves familiar with 
the hygienic requirements of bookmaking and 
refuse to read or teach from books which grossly 
transgress the standards for size of type, length 
of line, quality of paper, etc.! The slightest ac- 
quaintance with the hygienic norms of printing 
would have rendered impossible the adoption as 
texts of a great many books used in our public 
schools. It is well also to form the habit of oc- 
casionally looking off the book for a minute or 
two when engaged in reading. Few people are 
careful enough to avoid reading in light of deficient 
intensity or improperly placed. Many a teacher 
is made a nervous wreck by the necessity of fac- 
ing a strong light in the schoolroom. Others in- 
jure their eyes through the requirement of a 
needless amount of written work which must be

read and corrected. A good many teachers would 
do well to ponder the advice of Stanley Hall 
suggesting the substitution of real teaching for 
some of the correspondence courses often carried 
on with the pupils. 
But if the eyes “ go bad” in spite of hygienic 
care, the thing to do is to consult the best oculist 
in reach. Having secured competent advice she 
should follow it regardless of whether spectacles 
are becoming to her particular features. If the 
teacher is not clear on the difference between 
an oculist and an optician, she had better inform 
herself. Economy here is consummate extrava- 
gance. 
EXERCISE AND THE OUT OF DOORS 
If the teacher would be healthy she should take 
varied daily exercise, preferably of the play type. 
It is well to cultivate a hobby that will take one 
much out of doors, such as nature study, horse- 
back riding, tennis, etc. It is necessary to guard 
against undertaking too many collateral duties, 
such as Sunday-School teaching, club-work, and 
the like. No opportunity should be lost to coun-

teract the onesided sedentary life the teachef 
must of necessity lead. As expressed in the ad- 
vice of one counselor of health, “ Every man who 
is engagedina sedentary indoor occupation ought 
to spend at least two hours a day in the open 
air in some light but brisk and enjoyable form 
of exercise — not merely as an act of self-indul- 
gence of his lower nature, but as a means of in- 
creasing his efficiency.” 1 The same author re- 
minds us that for the period of manhood and 
womanhood, ‘the rod and the rifle, the racket, 
the paddle, and the snowshoe,” are the most suit- 
able types of gymnastic apparatus. 
Vacation is for the teacher the most critical 
division of the year. Professional success depends 
in no small degree upon the use that is made of 
the opportunities then offered for renewal of 
physical energy and moral enthusiasm. No ad-

one, but, generally speaking, a goodly fraction of 
the vacation should be spent in outdoor pursuits 
and a somewhat smaller portion in study, prefer- 
ably of a not too strictly professional kind. The 
vacation is preéminently a time for striking anew 
balance in things mental and physical. The some- 
what narrowing interests of the schoolroom should 
give place temporarily to other intellectual pur- 
suits and to the vitalizing, humanizing influences 
of literature, history, art, and friendship. On the 
physical side, the well-spent summer vacation 
should rid the teacher’s brain and muscles of the 
accumulated clinkers of a school-year, and if she 
belongs to the well-known variety pedagogia an- 
@mia she should carry to her schoolroom in Sep- 
tember at least a million more red corpuscles for 
each cubic centimeter of blood in her body than 
she could have boasted on the previous Com- 
mencement Day. Blood tests and other physical 
examinations are a recent and portentous addi- 
tion to the methods of experimental pedagogy. 
Ignatieff 1 has demonstrated that the week-long 
examination nearly always effects a loss of body

weight. Mosso and others have proved that pro- 
longed application to mental work reduces the 
depth of respiration to an astonishing degree. 
Graziani and Helwig have beautifully demon- 
strated that excessive devotion to mental work 
both reduces the percentage of hemoglobin and 
reinforces the “degenerative” processesin the red 
corpuscles.! Blood tests in the open-air schools 
show in a striking way the reverse phenomenon, 
ie., the increase in hemoglobin and number of 
blood corpuscles under the influence of open-air 
living, abundant exercise and diet, and shorter 
rations of mental work. There is no reason why 
a well-spent vacation should do less for the faded, 
wearied teacher than for the thirty-seven summer 
colony children studied by Dr. Borchmann, of 
Moscow. In this case the summer vacation pro- 
duced for the boys a gain of 936,000 red corpus- 
cles per cubic centimeter of blood and 6.1 per 
cent of hemoglobin; for the girls a gain of 
720,000 red corpuscles and 8.7 per cent of haemo-

DIET 
Constipation, nervousness, and anemia are 
three formidable and interrelated ills generally 
consequent upon over-work, worry, and neglect 
of diet and exercise. They are a veritable curse 
of the profession, dragging innumerable teachers 
along the retrograde path to professional incapa- 
city and premature superannuation. The teacher 
should know something about dietaries and the 
chemistry of digestion. She should make some 
study of her own idiosyncrasies of digestion and 
food preferences. She should black-list those 
articles of diet productive of costiveness. If pos- 
sible, the deadly cold lunch, eaten in solemn 
silence, should be forsworn. Thanks to the 
ingenious and convenient thermos bottle and 
thermos lunch-basket the cold lunch is no longer 
a necessary evil. It will be a blessing for both 
the cause of hygiene and education when every 
school, in city and country alike, is provided 
with facilities for preparing and serving the noon 
meal to all who cannot conveniently go home 
for it.

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
THE HYGIENE OF THE VOICE 
The pedagogical voice is expected to be any- 
thing but pleasant. When other professional 
symptoms fail to betray the identity of the teacher, 
the voice will usually suffice to do so. The path- 
ological basis for the teacher voice has been re- 
vealed by the medical investigations reported by 
Yonge (23) and Milligan, two English physicians, 
The former examinedone hundred women teachers 
of Manchester and discovered definite pathologi- 
cal conditions of the throat in seventy per cent 
of the entire number, mostly inflamed swellings 
of the vocal chords (“teachers’ nodes”’), chronic 
catarrh, etc. Thirty-one of the seventy had defin- 
ite lesions of the vocal organs. Though we have 
not so named it, the “school throat” is no less 
common than “clergyman’s sore throat.” The 
teacher has five “voice days” per week, the 
clergyman, only one. During each of these days 
the voice is employed for several hours. The 
strain, at best, is a severe one; but if the room 
is much above standard size, if two or more classes 
recite at once in the same room, or if there are 
74
-P-A-G-E-91
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE TEACHER 
other disturbances, then the strain becomes very 
trying, indeed. The teacher should guard her 
voice as something more than a mere instrument 
of communication. Her voice may make just the 
difference between success and failure. It has a 
distinct moral and also esthetic value. There is 
the voice which irritates and provokes and an- 
other which inspires quiet and instills respect. 
The loud, rasping voice is the thief of nervous 
energy, the enemy of effective discipline, and 
totally unnecessary. Likewise, exaggerated or 
artificial modulation is both uneconomical and 
displeasing. Temperance is a virtue of speech 
that applies as much to quality as to substance, 
“In short, the teacher’s voice is as important as 
her grammar. She is made painfully conscious 
of defects in the latter, but remains in blissful 
ignorance of the most disagreeable defects in the 
former. It would be well if normal-school stu- 
dents and teachers in service were graded by ex- 
perts in respect to the quality of the voice and 
given whatever training might be needed to im- 
prove it. The teacher can save her voice much 
strain by learning how to use it ; how to replace 
7

the jerky enunciation by a tone of pure quality, 
It would be of mutual advantage, too, if the 
teacher would learn to do less of the talking and 
let the pupils do more. The teacher who knows 
something of the hygiene of her own voice will 
also be in position to help reduce the amount of 
speech defectiveness among school-children.t 
SITTING vs. STANDING 
Constant standing is another source of injury to 
the health of the woman teacher. The importance 
of this is so well understood that many of our 
states have made statutory provisions requiring 
owners of department stores and other industries 
to provide benches or chairs on which women 
employees may rest while not actually engaged 
in work, Excessive standing is still more injur- 
ious to the teacher, because she finds it more 
difficult to escape the unhygienic customs of fem- 
inine dress than do women employed in many of

the industries. The high-heeled shoe is a positive 
menace, inducing well-defined spinal curvatures 
and displacement of the pelvic organs. Because 
the woman teacher must remain at her post of 
duty regardless of any periodic indisposition, she 
cannot too religiously observe the laws of per- 
sonal hygiene peculiar to her sex.

slight contribution to this end that the writer of- 
fers the following observations regarding certain 
ypes of mentality more or less peculiar to school- 
ce -— the teacher psychosis. 
The analysis here offered is a purely tentative 
ne, of necessity incomplete and possibly skewed 
at some points from the essential truth. Until the 
sychology of character, ethology, as John Stuart 
a christened it, has been given a more scien- 
tific basis than it now rests upon, any such analy- 
sis as that here attempted must inevitably reflect 
opinion rather than principles, and can only be 
(oa by its suggestive value ; not by any pre- 
ense to finality. 
If some of the descriptive phrases herein em- 
loyed seem a trifle strong, the reader is reminded 
hat they are used in the delineation of a type of 
character and that they cannot be taken as ap- 
lying with equal pertinence to the innumerable 
Oats who, taken together, compose the 
type. There is no single teacher psychosis, but 
many psychoses which vary in individual cases

te eeitcne grade of work (whether element-

ary, secondary, or college), and also with the 
particular professional mzz/iew. Moreover, having 
drawn freely upon the expressions of many crit- 
ics, the writer is hardly prepared to vouch for the 
literal truth of all the imputations here gathered 
together. It may readily be granted that some 
of these are unjust, some exaggerated, and that 
still others are but lingering traditions descended 
from that not very ancient time when teachers 
were composed mostly of slaves, cripples, or 
others hors de combat, so to speak, as regards the 
affairs of free and able-bodied men and women. 
It is believed, however, that some of the obser- 
vations are worthy of the teacher’s serious con- 
sideration. 
ATROPHY OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS 
Teachers tend to become bookish and unprac- 
tical, unable to bear their proper part in turning 
the wheels of social progress. Their energies are 
consumed within the four walls of the school- 
room. Their intercourse is with children, whose 
ring of social interest has hardly widened beyond 
the confines of the school playground or second 
80
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
back-alley. The large majority of elementary 
teachers are bachelors and spinsters, and are for 
this reason poorly qualified to view things from 
the truly social point of view. The longer this 
individualistic life continues the more havoc it 
plays with the native social tendencies. 
On the side of personality this is likely to show 
itself in an artificial demeanor. Instead of the 
open frankness, geniality, and poise of the busi- 
ness man, lawyer, or physician, the teacher is 
likely to be found unsocial, stilted, and didactic. 
Some teachers are too dogmatic to be agreeable 
companions ; too didactic, too instructive, too 
prone to impart information to stand on a give- 
and-take footing with their friends. Confining 
their associations so exclusively to those in the 
same profession, teachers are always in danger 
of developing a certain provincialism of intellect 
and character. 
Not infrequently teachers so lose touch with 
the needs of the social order that this in its pro- 
gress washes past them altogether, leaving them 
stranded high and dry like fossils on the deserted 
shore-line of an ancient sea. As for taking any

THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
active part in civic and political affairs, some 
teachers meet perfectly a recent characterization 
of college students— “as innocuous as a flock of 
sheep.” Another writer has gone so far as to say 
that the originators of ideas for social betterment 
do not look to teachers for sympathy or even for 
understanding. 
While few of us would admit the literal truth 
of these accusations, perhaps just as few would 
deny that our half-million school-teachers exert 
far less than their legitimate share of social in- 
fluence, their superior education and intelligence 
considered. Too little of their energy is devoted 
to civic and social leadership; too much to the 
maintenance of the statws guo. Many a teacher's 
conception of education seems to limit the func- 
tion of the school to the business of handing over 
to a rising generation the storehouse of infor- 
mation which has been found more or less val- 
uable for a previous generation. As a result, the 
school is too often like a chip that rises and 
falls on the waves of social evolution without 
either accelerating or impeding the movement 
thereof. 
82 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
To the extent the malady is an actual one its 
nature suggests the obvious cure. The institution 
of public education is in position to make itself 
the most powerful of all social influences, and 
there is no excuse for that narrow professional 
training which is capable of inspiring in teachers 
no higher conception of their duty than to serve 
like cogs in a piece of machinery whose larger 
purposes they do not comprehend. To this end 
the normal-school course should be extended in 
length and appropriately enriched by the addi- 
tion of broad courses in the sociological aspects 
of education. The teacher in service, also, should 
be encouraged to keep one foot in the living, 
throbbing world, militant for right in the civic 
affairs of the community. In so far as duties per- 
mit, the teacher should mingle with people of 
other occupations. As Dr. W. H. Burnham has 
said, “We tend to become mentally asphyxiated 
if we live too long amid our own exhalations 
even when these are of the highest spiritual 
quality.” 1

THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
PERVERSION OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS 
In addition to a general atrophy, the teacher’s 
social instincts also tend to well-defined perver- 
sions. Our reference here is primarily to the 
male teacher, in whom such perversions are most 
common. Traditionally the male teacher is char- 
acterized by undue social timidity, obsequious- 
ness, and lack of manly force. He is likely to be 
aggravatingly humble, meek in facing dangerous 
local situations, patronizing, apologetic, and effem- 
inate; “a mite docile,” as even the kind-hearted 
James calls him. 
There is doubtless truth as well as exaggera- 
tion in the indictment as thus framed. By way of 
explanation it has been suggested that the pro- 
fession attracts a disproportionate number of 
young men who are by nature somewhat negative 
socially. For the timid, those not quite certain 
of their powers, the school opens up a safe haven 
of refuge (39). It offers a sure if modest liveli- 
hood and the opportunity to live as one wishes, 
provided always the duties of the office are dis- 
charged faithfully and without fuss. The profes- 
84 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
sion is too much shielded from the hot struggles 
of competition. Moreover, the necessity of thus 
working in harness, in a system where personal 
loyalty and obedience assume magnified impor- 
tance, deters many bold, rough, positive, indepen- 
dent young men from entering the profession. 
Particularly is this true in a country like ours 
which offers so many other outlets for the entre- 
preneur spirit, the will to accomplish. 
Still more serious is the charge often made, 
both from within and out of the profession, that 
those in administrative positions repress the indi- 
viduality of teachers in the ranks. Grade teachers, 
it is said, obey the principals, the principals the 
superintendent, and the latter the public as re- 
presented in the school board. The self-respect- 
ing man finds it hard to adjust to “the system,” 
a gigantic structure with foundations deeply laid 
in the crystallized rock of traditions. The more 
docile, dependent, obedient, and less assertive 
woman accepts the situation as a matter of course. 
Those in authority are undisputed lords, each in 
his own domain, and the road is clear for the de- 
velopment of the dictatorial, overbearing school 
85

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
tyrant, whom we are to regard as the product of 
an all-pervading influence which is not easily 
withstood. The possession of such autocratic 
power is not noted for broadening the sympathies 
or deepening generosity. As Mr. McAndrew says 
(40) superintendents and principals have their 
own way in so many little things that they ac- 
quire an “unnatural appetite for victory.” They 
cannot yield gracefully, even in unimportant mat- 
ters. Criticism from without paralyzes them, 
but coming from within it only serves to draw 
the reins a little tighter. There are superinten- 
dents of schools who have been known to require 
all their teachers to sign a formal document ex- 
pressly agreeing to submit without complaint to 
instantaneous dismissal at the pleasure of the 
superintendent. 
Merely to condemn the school tyrant as brutal 
is not charitable, nor does it do justice to the 
facts. The latter is but the product of a condition. 
That his kind is not more numerous speaks well 
for the humanitarian character of those whom 
the profession attracts. In fact, within her own 
domain the classroom teacher herself succumbs 
86 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
  THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
to the same subtle influence. Dealing only with 
inferior minds she acquires an exaggerated sense 
of her importance. The instinct of self-asser- 
tion is not less powerful than the instinct of self- 
abasement. Every individual harbors both; it 
depends upon personal environment which one 
is uppermost at any given moment. 
THE DIDACTIC HABIT 
Closely connected with the above is the danger 
of becoming dogmatic, exacting and meddlesome. 
In looking for the faults and mistakes of children, 
teachers tend to lose human sympathy and gen- 
erosity. Who has not witnessed that sad but 
common form of discipline which consists in 
having children stand, sit, straighten, turn, fold 
arms, and move or speak only by signal? Who 
does not know the volley-like, rapid fire of com- 
mands which wound even the heart of the sym- 
pathetic onlooker ? The teacher comes to look 
upon the pet regulations and rules of her creation 
as categorical imperatives immanent in the na- 
ture of the moral order. Some rules of the school 
are grounded on rational necessities exactly to 
87
-P-A-G-E-104
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
the extent that savage tabus are, which they so 
much resemble. Like the latter, the petty restric- 
tions of the school starve the growth of individ- 
uality. In normal schools teachers are instructed 
that the chief aim of education is to teach children 
to inhibit, or as it is expressed in the latest ped- 
aguese “to overlay primitive impulses with im- 
pulses of higher order.” Within the school she 
develops into a Citizen Fixit, meddling with the 
coarsest touch among the most delicate tendrils 
of the child’s mental and moral growth. One of 
the most difficult lessons for the teacher to learn 
is that it is an audacious thing to rush in to med- 
dle with the conscience of another, even if that 
other is a little child; that in doing so there is 
danger of misreading the child’s motives, misun- 
derstanding him, insulting him. The traditional 
bull in the china shop cannot be more destructive 
than the over-conscientious, meddlesome, clumsy, 
and ignorant teacher in the réle of zwhzbitor of 
primitive impulses. 
The “teaching instinct” may be a valuable 
element in the teacher’s equipment, but when it 
hypertrophies into a veritable “didactic habit,” 
88 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
it should be repressed. Teachers need to learn 
that periods of lying fallow are no less essential 
for mental growth than their eternal volleys of 
instruction ; that their besetting sin is teaching 
too much and leaving too little for growth; that 
education is an organic process and that the mind 
does not grow by agglutination; that the most 
responsive beings in the world to the personal 
touch are little children, with their veritable pas- 
sions of imitation, loyalty, and hero-worship. In- 
deed, the prodding, vexatious teacher is less in 
place in the elementary school than in a Johns 
Hopkins or Harvard graduate seminar. 
METHOD CULT AND PEDANTRY 
Stanley Hall (35) characterizes method cult 
as “the most subtle form of pedagogical pathol- 
ogy.” Verbalism, rules, definitions, preciseness, 
and accuracy of form tend to replace substance. 
Every slightly different way of doing a thing 
comes to be labeled with a name of its own. 
Pedagogical books and articles literally swarm 
with these methodological ghosts, so that it re- 
quires a discerning intelligence, to distinguish 
89 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
the little that is genuine from the much that is 
spurious. 
The outcome of the method fetich is that in 
the process of instruction everything is analyzed 
to atoms; the juice of the subject-matter is 
squeezed out and only the indigestible fibre re- 
mains. What is meant is amply illustrated by 
the thousand and one rigid forms of grammatical 
parsing and sentence diagramming (as H. G. 
Wells puts it, “a ritual called parsing that must 
be seen to be believed ”’), or by the petty exacti- 
tude sometimes required in the formal statement 
of arithmetical solutions. The writer’s advice was 
once asked by a California school-teacher on the 
following momentous question : In the first state- 
ment of the solution of a percentage problem 
involving profit or loss, which is correct : to say 
that “100 per cent equals the cost price,” or that 
“cost price equals 100 per cent ” ? 
Teachers are prone to overestimate the value 
of the traditional subject-matter of school instruc- 
tion, much of which is obsolete fact, misapplied 
half-truth, or useless pedantry. Some of the stock 
illustrations in “ rhetoric,” curious, nut-cracking 
90
-P-A-G-E-107
    THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
problems of arithmetics, and natve misinformation 
of current geographies have been traced back 
through many generations of texts, each of which 
had contributed its quantum of useless or incor- 
rect material to the texts which followed. The 
shreds and patches of current school information 
the teacher hashes over again and again until 
she mistakes them for wisdom, until she can see 
for her pupils no salvation the road to which does 
not lie through familiarity with the chronological 
order of Washington’s military maneuvers, or the 
names of the finer structures of the human body. 
In truth no small part of the school curriculum 
is conventional, of value only to those who learn 
it for the sake of teaching it to others. 
A real difficulty of pedagogy lies in the fact 
that the school’s activity is not purposive as far 
as any immediate end is concerned, but always 
anticipatory of some distant future. It deals 
with imagined situations, prepares for exigencies 
which may or may not be encountered. The 
teacher therefore must always feign, counterfeit, 
imitate the real and inherent. Her teaching is 
at the opposite pole from that which the master 
gL
-P-A-G-E-108
  “THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
of a trade gives day by day to his apprentice. 
The difficulty, however, is not one to be over 
come either by an ultra-refinement of some theo- 
retically ideal procedure or by the repudiation 
of method as such. The teacher needs more mo- 
mentum. Her professional outlook is too little 
scientific. Only a thorough initiation into the 
positivistic data of child psychology and child 
hygiene, combined with first-hand acquaintance 
with the results of the promising young science 
of Experimental Pedagogy will suffice to rid the 
teacher of her solemn belief in method magic. 
PREMATURE MENTAL DECAY 
Montaigne has likened the teacher to a grind- 
stone, dulling her own edges in the process of 
sharpening the wits of others. To the extent that 
this is true, two conditions, chiefly, are respon- 
sible: The teacher’s work is too repetitive or 
mechanical, and it supplies opportunity for an 
interplay with inferior minds only. Intellectually 
the teacher tends to be dragged down to the 
A B C level where she lives and moves. Pain- 
fully evident sometimes is this dwarfing effect 
92
-P-A-G-E-109
THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
of contact with little minds. Through overmuch 
repetition of the elementary and familiar, the 
mind loses incentive to push on. The teacher 
falls a victim to fixed modes of interpretation 
and of action which she is incapable of changing 
except on the greatest provocation. Extreme 
habituation also endangers many-sidedness of 
interest. The psychological law of relativity is 
here applicable. The teacher finds it hard to be 
spontaneous, fresh, and inspiring at the hundredth 
repetition. The result may be either dead routine 
or else hypocritical assumption of an enthusiasm 
which has long since expired. The mind can only 
live by pushing on to new ideas or to unceasing 
reélaboration of the old. Unlike the artist, the 
lawyer, or the physician, the teacher is not always 
stimulated to this. Her conceptions lose fluidity 
by the mere fact of repetition. 
A chapter might be written on the growth and 
decay of an idea in the individual mind. At its

repetition this fringe of intimations is brushed 
away, as pebbles are smoothed by the flowing 
water. New categories are no longer possible. 
Novelty, as such, is beyond apprehension. The 
personality is “shut in,” to use a term of modern 
psychopathology. Intellectual growth is at an 
end; firm, rigid lines settle in upon the soul — it 
is habit-bound. 
The recipe for inducing this state of mental 
fixation is simple and sure: the monotonous re- 
petition of elementary activities under conditions 
of strain which prevent other lines of mental func- 
tioning. The process is hastened when the rout- 
ine activities of the intellect act in conjunction 
with school-bred fatigue. One of the earliest 
symptoms of protracted nervous overstrain is the 
elimination of interests which do not contribute 
directly to the day’s work. In the case of the tired 
teacher one after another of these interests is 
lopped off till life is stripped to its barest essen- 
tials. The mind narrows, becomes mechanical, 
and loses its humanity. 
An important antidote is to reserve certain 
hours each day for a vacation from professional 
94

THE HYGIENE OF CHARACTER 
habits. This is recreation, which therefore should 
become the teacher’s religion. It should involve 
play, the very essence of which is its creativeness 
and the relaxation from habitual routine, and it 
should be seasoned with constructive mental ac- 
tivity in some field of art, literature, science, etc. 
This will foster the attitude of the learner, with- 
out which early decay is certain. The daily re- 
creation will need also to be reinforced by vaca- 
tions spent in travel or in non-professional study. 
As already emphasized, the teacher would do 
well to make and keep a few intimate friends 
chosen directly from other professions or from 
even quite different walks of life. 
Finally the teacher should cultivate the faculty 
of “doing the usual thing in the unusual way.” 
The artist temperament should be her ideal, for 
the true artist abhors exact duplications and al- 
ways endeavors to transvaluate all his experience. 
In every possible way variety should be mingled 
with the day’s routine. The daily program could 
be upset topsy-turvy now and then to the benefit 
of both pupils and teacher. There is little danger 
of going too far, since everything else makes for 
95
-P-A-G-E-112
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
conformity. Within certain limits the teacher 
might be shifted from one grade or one depart- 
ment to another, or, where this is not feasible, a 
new position should be sought occasionally. To 
escape the danger of a premature mental arrest, 
every possible source of life and enthusiasm 
should be utilized. 
THE LOSS OF ENTHUSIASM 
By this is meant that state of gloomy dissatis- 
faction or flabby indifference which is so likely 
to supervene in the woman teacher of thirty-five 
or forty years who is beginning to realize that 
she must give up forever all aspirations of fulfill- 
ing the one destiny for which woman was created 
(30). Before the onset of this condition women 
are the ideal teachers of pre-adolescent children. 
They are sympathetic, gracious, vivacious, hope- 
ful. Many are endowed with a temperament which 
enables them to retain these ideal qualities into 
ripe old age. In some teachers, however, enthu- 
siasm gradually wanes. If the woman so situated 
continues to teach she is likely to develop the 
traits of fussy exactness, querulous dissatisfac- 
96

tion, morbid suspicion and harshness. Physical 
invalidity may be added. 
Fortunately the loss of enthusiasm is not in- 
evitable, as is proved by the happy, helpful lives 
of countless elderly women teachers. The pur- 
suit of philanthropic interests, in school or out, 
is an admirable substitute for the activities in- 
tended by the maternal instinct. There is also 
the genuine, though vicarious, satisfaction af- 
forded by daily contact with the children of other 
mothers. The exceptional teacher in whom the 
ugly spite of nature will not be conciliated, who 
after every effort to attain philosophical consola- 
tion finds herself weary, crabbed, and embittered, 
should not hesitate, at whatever sacrifice to her- 
self, to seek a calling where the influence of her 
unhappy life will not shed its blight upon the 
tender souls of children.

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NORMAL 
SCHOOL 
Tue key to the situation is in the normal schools, 
which in at least three respects are in position to 
contribute more than they do to the hygienic 
status of the profession: (1) They could do a 
great deal to improve the physical condition of 
their students while in training. (2) They could 
offer and prescribe thorough courses in the fun- 
damentals of personal hygiene, including both 
the mental and physical aspects, so that teachers 
will know how to preserve their health in spite 
of the unhygienic environment. (3) The normal 
schools are under the moral obligation to exer- 
cise a rigid selective function over those who 
present themselves as candidates for the pro- 
fession. 
OVERPRESSURE IN THE NORMAL SCHOOL 
As regards the first of these points, there is 
reason to believe that the intense strain of the 
98
-P-A-G-E-115
  RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
normal course directly contributes to the human 
wreckage which litters the profession. Hardly 
anyone will deny that normal-school students 
are as a rule sadly overworked, but the over- 
pressure is frequently justified on the plea of ne- 
cessity!, Dr. W. H. Burnham (7) asked the fol- 
lowing questions of 569 normal-school students 
_ of the Néw England and Middle West States : — 
“st. What conditions in the normal school or 
its environment and in’ the methods and courses 
of instrtiction have you found beneficial or injur- 
ious to your health?” 
“2d. What changes in your phagtiaenl condi- 
tion, such as increase or loss of weight, improve- 
ment or loss of health, special illness, or the like, 
have you noticed since you entered the normal 
school?” 
“3d. Give a full account of your day’s pro- 
gram, — amount of time devoted to study, exer- 
cise, recreation, sleep, etc.” 
Of these 569 students, nearly 20 per cent re- 
ported that they had suffered impairment of 
health during their training course, while only 
25.5 per cent report: improvement. This is espe- 
i 99
-P-A-G-E-116
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
cially significant when we remember that the 
students questioned were young women who had 
just arrived at an age when the functions of sex 
have ordinarily become established and normal. 
Under hygienic conditions young women at this 
age ought to show almost universal improve- 
ment. It appears, however, that a large propor- 
tion of our normal-school graduates, probably as 
many as one fourth, enter a strenuous profession 
for the successful pursuit of which they are al- 
ready physically unfit. Of the same students, 
61 per cent mentioned conditions in the normal 
school which they considered detrimental to 
health. The injurious conditions most frequently 
designated related to over-pressure, to the dis- 
traction incident to’ carrying too many studies, 
imperfect heating and ventilation of classrooms, 
and the climbing of stairs. As the most common 
causes of health improvement, exercises in phys- 
ical training and the regularity of school life re- 
ceived most mention. The students met an aver- 
age of more than six class appointments daily, 
worked on an average about nine hours, exercised 
fifty-five minutes, and slept about 7.89 hours. It

would be difficult to find a competent person 
willing to defend such a regimen for girls just 
emerging from the stdrm and stress of adoles- 
cence, 
In a study made by the writer of the causes of 
irregular attendance in a California State Normal 
School, the health factor was much in evidence. 
To secure accurate information on this point a 
health questionnaire was submitted to about three 
hundred students. To remove all motive for con- 
cealment of ill health those answering were re- 
quested not to attach their signatures, Data were 
collected as follows : — 
(1) “ How many colds have you contracted dur- 
ing the past school year?” (This investigation 
was made in June, near the close of the year.) 
Results : 8 per cent had contracted six or more 
colds ; 32 per cent, three to five; 47 per cent, 
one or two; and 13 per cent, none at all. 
(2) “Do you have headaches frequently, occa- 
sionally, or not at all?” Result : 53 per cent have 
them frequently, 20 per cent, occasionally, and 
27 per cent are entirely free from them. 
(3) “Ave you constipated habitually, occasion- 
Ior
-P-A-G-E-118
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
ally, or not at all?” Result: 15.6 per cent suffer 
habitually from this serious impairment of health, 
41.5 per cent, occasionally, and about 45 per 
cent, not at all. 
Two other questions asked for information as 
to the regularity of the functions of menstrua- 
tion and the need of monthly rest periods ; 39 
per cent report themselves as not “normal” or 
“regular” in this respect ; 56 per cent testify to 
the need of one or more days of rest per month 
from this cause ; 9 per cent say four days, 8 per 
cent, three days, 20 per cent, two days, and 19 
per cent, one day. However, only a few more 
than half of those who believe themselves to need 
such rest ever takeit. The leading reasons given 
for this neglect are that they cannot afford the 
time for rest, that they would get behind in their 
work, etc. It is well to emphasize that these sta- 
tistics were obtained by questionnaire and that 
a searching medical examination would certainly 
have revealed a yet greater extent of ill health. 
No account whatever was taken of visual and 
auditory defects, or of throat, lung, and heart 
affections. 
102

  RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
An inventory of the possible factors influ- 
encing the health of students in this school re- 
vealed the following points : ///-ventilation: About 
a third of the classrooms have no mechanical 
system of ventilation, and the ventilation of sev- 
eral which do is by no means satisfactory. The 
ventilating system is only operated in connec- 
tion with the heating plant and the latter is not 
in use more than one third of the school-hours 
of the year. Temperature: The automatic con- 
trols sometimes fail to work and a difference of 
ten degrees in the temperature of two rooms, or 
of the same room in different periods of the day 
is not at all uncommon. Humidity : No adequate 
equipment for supplying the requisite amount of 
moisture to the heated air. Dust: Dry sweeping 
on that part of the floor occupied by seats and 
desks. The common cup: In constant use. ///u- 
mination: In some parts of the building badly 
deficient in amount and objectionable in other 
respects. H7l/ climbing and stairs: The school 
is situated ona hill about sixty feet above the 
level of the nearest street-car line. The building 
itself is three stories high, all the floors being 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
about equally used. We can only conjecture the 
extent of injury this has produced in the quarter- 
century the school has been used. Distance from 
school: It was found that only one sixth of the 
students were independent of street cars. The 
remaining five sixths rode to school daily in street 
cars, about one third from suburban quarters.t 
Some of these factors are more or less peculiar 
to the school in question. There are others, how- 
ever, which are probably common to nearly all 
normal schools in this country. One of these is 
the nervous strain incident to carrying in mind 
the details of so many courses of instruction, 
lesson plans for practice teaching, etc. The entire 
day is strenuously occupied. The courses them- 
selves may not be over-difficult, but the neces- 
sity of attending daily to so many separate tasks 
leads to distraction and fatigue. It is not at 
all uncommon for students in normal schools to 
carry a program of twenty-six to thirty lessons 
* It is a pleasure to add that through the untiring efforts of 
the school’s President and Board of Trustees, the above-de- 
scribed ‘plant will very soon be replaced by one of the most 
modern and expensive normal-school buildings in the United 
States. 
104
-P-A-G-E-121
  
RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
per week. The school above described seldom 
permitted more than twenty-four, including the 
daily chorus practice. However, to reduce the 
nervous strain still further, the intermissions be- 
tween classes were lengthened, as a result of the 
inquiry, from five to ten minutes. Students and 
teachers alike testified to the decided relief thus 
afforded. 
In most European countries the pressure upon 
normal training students is still more severe. In 
France the weekly program includes from 30 to 
35 recitations ; in Italy, 30 to 33; in Germany, 
32 to 35; in Austria, 28 to 30; and in Switzer- 
land, 33 to 4o (6). An investigation of the health 
of the students in a Swiss seminary for female 
teachers indicated that only about one third were 
in good health. The remainder suffered chiefly 
from anzemia, nervousness, heart disturbances, 
etc. 
In England the worst conditions of all are 
found. In this case the overpressure is connected 
with the pupil-teacher system, a method of pro- 
fessional training which has been in vogue in Eng- 
land since 1846. According to this system, pro- 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
mising pupils are chosen at the age of fourteen 
or fifteen years (formerly as early as thirteen), 
and from this time on permitted to teach part 
time as apprentices, at the same time continuing 
their academic studies. The following table shows 
typical weekly programs for the four years dur- 
ing which the training lasts : —

Though the pupil-teacher’s schedule has been 
greatly improved in recent years by the limitation 
of study to the forenoon period and teaching to 
the afternoon, the lot of the English pedagogical 
apprentice is yet a very trying one. 
Reverting to the plea of necessity, so often 
heard as an excuse for overpressure in normal 
schools, it is legitimate to ask whether it would 
not be wiser to lengthen the course a little in- 
stead of defying the laws of nature in the effort 
to crowd three years of work into two, or four 
into three. Teaching can never rise to the dignity 
of a profession with us until our professional 
106
-P-A-G-E-123
RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
training becomes less fragmentary and superfi- 
cial. Three years beyond high-school graduation 
should be the very lowest limit for certification. 
Four years would be far better. To be sure, such 
an extensive preparation will not be feasible or 
even possible until salaries are increased in pro- 
portion. But this is not a valid objection to our 
proposal. Money spent in improving the quality 
and training of its teachers is the most profitable 
investment society ever makes. We have lately 
seen the lengthening of medical courses from two 
years above the common school to three or four 
years beyond college graduation. Nor does cheap- 
ness atone for incompetency in the business of 
training minds any more than in the curing of 
bodies. 
SELECTING THE CANDIDATES ON THE BASIS OF 
HEALTH 
In the secend place, normal schools could con- 
tribute to the hygiene of the profession and at 
the same time to the protection of the public if 
they would conscientiously undertake a selection 
in the admission of their students. Before enter- 
107
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
ing upon the training course all candidates should 
be required to undergo a thorough physical exam- 
ination made by experts employed by the school it- 
self. The usual formal requirement of normal 
schools that students present on matriculation a 
certificate of good health “from some reputable 
physician” is utterlyfruitless. The writer knows 
from his own experience that students with tu- 
berculosis, extreme neurasthenia, grave organic 
defects, or even epilepsy, have no difficulty (be 
it said to the shame of the medical profession) 
in fulfilling this requirement. There is no valid 
reason why this examination should not be just 
as searching as that given for life insurance. It 
should include especially examination for diseases 
of the lungs, heart, nervous system, and digestive 
system. The eye and ear examination should be 
made by experts rather than by the school’s phy- 
sician or director of physical training. Pertinent 
facts should be secured relating to candidates, — 
previous illnesses, hereditary antecedents, etc. 
The physically unfit should be rejected, including 
those of worst heredity, those with indications 
of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, Graves’s Dis- 
108 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
ease, or other progressive or serious organic trou- 
bles. Candidates suffering from ailments such as 
anzemia, chorea, stuttering, neurasthenia, heart 
weakness, etc., should be rejected until recovery 
is assured. The examination should be repeated 
each year after entrance and again when the can- 
didate enters upon regular employment. 
The welfare of children is so deeply involved 
in this matter that it is no longer charity to make 
of the profession a haven for cripples, neurasthe- 
nics, and others of delicate constitution. Exam- 
inations like those mentioned above are already 
given in the training schools of France and Eng- 
land, and in a few cities of the United States. 
In England (22) the Board of Education requires 
a physical examination at the beginning of the 
course, a certificate of good health at the begin- 
ning of each year during the course, and a thor- 
ough examination at the end of the course. In 
case physical defects are discovered, the physi- 
cian is required to state fully the nature and ex- 
tent of the impairment and whether he regards 
the symptoms astransitory orlasting. The French 
schools have been safeguarded by regulations 
109 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
similar to the above since the ministerial require- 
ment of 1897. The number rejected in France 
varies from one half per cent to twelve per cent 
in the different training schools. The majority 
of rejections are for anzemia, dry pleurisy, weak 
constitution, or suspicions of tuberculosis (5). A 
large proportion of those put on probation and 
later admitted break down before the completion 
of the course. In general, the more careful the 
examination the larger the number rejected and 
the smaller the number placed on probation. This 
means that probation as a rule is only the post- 
ponement of an evil which it is hoped to prevent. 
It is seen from the range of percentages of re- 
jections that some schools are content with a de- 
cidedly lower standard than others. Where the 
rejections and probations together run as low as 
one or two per cent, the examination may be 
looked upon with suspicion. It is said that New 
York City rejects ordinarily about three per cent. 
Besides this initial medical examination, an- 
other no less thorough should be given upon the 
completion of the normal-school course. Here 
the responsibility of the normal-school ends, and 
110 
  sl
-P-A-G-E-127
  RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
the obligation of further protection to the health 
of the teacher rests upon the officers of school 
administration. Every argument for the medical 
inspection of school-children applies equally to 
the teachers, who have the same right that their 
pupils have to timely warning against the insidi- 
ous inroads of disease. 
It goes without saying that the value of medi- 
cal inspection, either for teachers in training or 
in service, depends wholly upon the conscien- 
tiousness with which it is administered. To pro- 
tect the children of the state from teachers who 
are below a reasonable standard of physical or 
moral fitness imposes upon the normal-school 
authorities. a duty which at times may be irksome 
and unpleasant, but one which they are morally 
obligated to perform, unmoved by sentiments of 
sympathy, friendship, or fear. Suitable state leg- 
islation facilitates the discharge of this obligation. 
HYGIENIC INSTRUCTION IN THE NORMAL SCHOOL 
In the third place, the normal school is at 
fault in not giving its students the semblance of 
an adequate introduction to personal and educa-

tional hygiene. A recent report on Zhe Teaching 
and Practice of Hygiene in the Public Normal 
Schools of the United States,1 based on rather 
detailed questionnaire returns from eighty-four 
of the better class of schools, establishes the fol- 
lowing significant facts :— 
(1) That one half of the eighty-four schools offer 
either no hygiene at all, or else none aside from 
that given incidentally in connection with physi- 
ology. Nine schools give neither hygiene nor 
physiology, and those giving the latter devote so 
little time to it (usually one third or one half of 
a year) that very little can be accomplished in 
hygiene. 
(2) That courses in personal hygiene, school 
hygiene, sanitation, prophylaxis, clinical psycho- 
logy, etc., are only slowly finding a place in the 
normal-school course of study, and that mental 
hygiene is receiving scarcely any attention. 
(3) That comparatively little is being done with 
the problem of sex hygiene in the way of direct

instruction, and that the normal schools are not 
making the best of their opportunity to train 
teachers who can use nature study and biology 
as an approach to this subject. 
(4) That in the practice of hygiene nearly two 
thirds of the schools confess themselves guilty 
of harboring conditions that should not be allowed 
to exist, chiefly inadequate ventilation, improper 
lighting, unsatisfactory boarding and rooming 
places, and overpressure. 
(5) That twenty-five per cent of the schools 
do not have a gymnasium in the charge of a phy- 
sical director and that athletics and recreation do 
not receive the attention they should. 
(6) That but few of our normal schools are 
giving special training to teachers in the obser- 
vation of physical defectiveness or in the applica- 
tion of mental and physical tests. 
(7) That only one of the eighty-four schools 
| attempts to train special teachers of hygiene for 
the public schools. 
(8) That, on the whole, sufficient science is 
offered (though not necessarily required) to serve 
as a reasonably good foundation for the various 
113 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
  
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
forms of hygiene instruction, and that a good 
proportion of the teachers of physiology and hy- 
giene in these schools have university or college 
degrees and are probably capable of doing better 
work than their present allotment of time permits. 
In order that teachers may be placed in a po- 
sition to protect themselves from those risks to 
health and happiness which are sure to be en- 
countered in the practice of their calling, as well 
as also for the sake of fitting them to act as the 
health guardians of their pupils, the subject 
of School Hygiene should be raised from its 
present neglect and given the right of way in the 
normal-school curriculum. Instruction in the 
subject should escape its present absurd limita- 
tion to the traditional (and sometimes obsolete) 
laws of heating, lighting, and ventilation, and 
ground itself upon the newer and infinitely 
broader conceptions of its bearing and scope. It 
should include, among others, such fundamental 
topics as the hygiene of physical and mental 
growth, the physiology of diet and of exercise, 
the hygiene of the throat, lungs, and voice, men-

tal hygiene (including the psychology of learning, 
economic alternations of work, rest and sleep), 
the hygiene of instruction, the relation of the 
school to the great world scourges like tubercu- 
losis, venereal disease, malaria, hookworm disease, 
etc. In the light of the modern advances in pre- 
ventive medicine, together with the widespread 
interest in the social aspects of hygiene and the 
recognition of the importance of athletics, play, 
and the physical side generally in the scheme of 
education, the present comparative neglect of ed- 
ucational hygiene in the normal schools becomes 
an intolerable anachronism. 
Our normal schools, indeed, appear to be all 
but unconscious of the fact that they are living 
in the midst of one of the greatest educational 
reforms the world has ever seen, —a movement 
which is indispensable to both the physical and 
moral regeneration of the nation; namely, the 
application of scientific knowledge to the business 
of conserving and extending the efficiency of the 
psychophysical organism. It is otherwise impos- 
sible to account for the fact that teachers have 
paid so little heed to the health conditions of their 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
pupils, that they are among the largest consum- 
ers of patent medicines (12), and that so many 
of them accept the wildest vagaries of Christian 
Science. That the normal schools are in the rear 
of the educational procession as regards educa- 
tional hygiene becomes evident when one com- 
pares their practice with the interest displayed 
in the subject by city superintendents, principals, 
women’s clubs, mother’s leagues, civic organiza- 
tions, and school hygiene associations. At its 
IgII meeting the Child Hygiene section of the 
National Education Association adopted by unan- 
imous vote the following resolution :— 
“ Resolved, That the Department of Child 
Study of the National Education Association for- 
mally memorialize the normal schools through- 
out the country to extend and modernize their 
teaching of the subject of child hygiene and re- 
lated topics.”

tion of its teachers other than the merely nega- 
tive function of rejection on the basis of certain 
standards of academic scholarship. Any young 
woman who has the intellect to attain a certain 
memoriter mastery of the stock subjects of the 
high school and normal school curriculum may 
make her way to the teacher’s chair regardless of 
the most flagrant personal unfitness. She may be 
illiterate, careless, ugly-tempered, cynical, void of 
sympathy for children or respect for her profes- 
sion, but if she is sufficiently determined and 
not downright feeble-minded, she may be gradu- 
ated from almost any public normal school in 
the United States. Not that her kind will be 
looked upon with favor in the normal school. Dur- 
ing her course of training she will be criticized, 
scolded, penalized, sometimes required to repeat 
subjects, or put on probation — but in all except 
the rarest cases she will finally be brevetted with 
the school’s stamp of approval. Persistence is the 
main virtue necessary to win. The assumption 
of everyone concerned seems to be that because 
the public normal school zs public it must main- 
tain itself an open highway on which anyone may

walk untrammeled into the teaching profession. 
Once graduated, the candidate does not stand 
in need of any special recommendation from her 
alma mater relative to her personal fitness, The 
DirLoma answers her purpose, because it is ac- 
cepted in good faith as a signed and sealed guar- 
antee from a responsible party that she has been 
sufficiently tried out and has been found worthy 
of the public’s confidence. 
It may be objected to this criticism that the 
function of rejection rests with the employers of 
teachers rather than with the normal school. This 
argument, however, involves the absurd applica- 
tion to education of the caveat emptor principle 
which is fast becoming obsolete even in the marts 
of commerce. The public is no more in the 
position to protect itself against the undesirable 
teacher than against adulterated foods and medi- 
cines. Society has created the normal school in 
order to secure a protection which it cannot ac- 
complish itself, and rests under the delusion that 
the insurance it has contracted for is genuine.

about blackballing the morally unfit than in ex- 
cluding the consumptive or neurasthenic. 
There is quite another class of normal-school 
students who also stand in need of vocational 
advice ; students who may be possessed of ex- 
cellent moral qualities and superior intelligence, 
but who, for one reason or another, ought not to 
become teachers. One of these considerations — 
health—has already received our attention. In 
season and out, the idea should be combated that 
the teaching profession is one adapted to the 
strength of actual or hereditarily potential weak- 
lings. Other qualities of merit, just as critical, are 
the capacity to understand and inspire the child 
mind, the possession of a “teaching instinct,” 
the personal bearing, professional attitude, pleas- 
ing voice, the absence of unsightly physical de- 
formities, etc. 
Before it can intelligently exercise the func- 
tions of vocational guidance it will be necessary 
for the normal school to devote a great deal of 
serious study to the psychology of the teacher. It 
does, of course, make a certain effort, though of 
a crudely empirical nature, to determine the lines 
119 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
of special strength and weakness of its students. 
For example, the supervisor of practice teaching 
grades her students on such distinct points as 
“discipline,” “neatness,” “preparation,” “ abil- 
ity to impart knowledge,” etc. This is a very 
good method as far as it goes, but it needs 
to be scientifically refined and systematically 
employed in order to furnish data of any material 
value. 
Instead of pursuing some purely theoretical 
and mechanical scheme for grading the teacher’s 
qualifications, the normal school might undertake 
to ascertain the relations which actually exist be- 
tween various personal, social, intellectual, voli- 
tional, and emotional traits on the one hand and 
teaching success on the other. Our present naive 
phrenological attitude on the subject needs to 
be replaced by a positive body of fact bearing on 
the psychology of teaching success. To secure the 
necessary data will require that we abandon the 
artificial schematizations, the rough-and-ready 
rubrics, in common use, and institute in their 
stead a searching psychological analysis to de- 
termine the essential nature of all those attri- 
120 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  
RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
butes and conditions which determine the teach- 
er’s success. 
One obvious and feasible method would be for 
the normal school to maintain an efficient “ fol- 
low-up” service among its graduates, in order to 
ascertain for each the degree of success or fail- 
ure and the reasons therefor. Then by the ap- 
plication of well-known mathematical formulz, 
coefficients of correlation can be established be- 
tween “success” and any particular quality of 
merit or group of such qualities. The limits of this 
book do not permit an exposition of the method 
or an appreciation of its results, but it may be 
said that until we have many studies of the type 
referred to at the foot of this page, it will be 
impossible to assert with any degree of confidence 
the relative value as elements in the teacher's 
success of the various qualities of merit custom- 
arily taken into account. 
The aim of such study is to distinguish funda- 
mental lines of cleavage in teacher personality 
* Ruediger and Strayer, “ The Qualities of Merit in Teach- 
ers,” Jour. Ed. Psychol., May, 1910; and Arthur Clifton 
Boyce, “ The Qualities of Merit in Secondary Teachers,” Jour. 
Ld. Psychol., March, 1912.

  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
from the superficial striations which first strike 
the attention. We do not yet know what veins of 
merit are most worth working. It is impossible, 
on the basis of our present knowledge, to fore- 
cast these cleavages, since they are the result- 
ants of many variational factors both in the in- 
dividual and in the profession itself. However, 
merely to indicate in a general way the signifi- 
cance of such study the following rubrics are 
offered for whatever they may be worth :— 
1. Fitting the Teacher to the Grade of In- 
struction, Obviously, very different capacities are 
demanded in the ‘kindergarten, primary grades, 
grammar school, high school, college and univer- 
sity. There can be no single ideal teacher person- 
ality. Just what qualities and combinations of 
qualities are most suitable for these various lines 
remains to be determined, but it is certain that 
there are many high-school teachers who ought 
to be in the grades, grade teachers who ought 
to be in the high school, kindergartners who 
would do better work in the grammar school, and 
so on. 
2. Fitting the Teacher to the Subject, together 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
with the problem of ascertaining permissible lim- 
its of specialization for teachers in different grades 
of work. Many of our special teachers have 
drifted into their departments. Students of un- 
usual scientific ability are permitted, or even en- 
couraged, to become humdrum teachers of liter- 
ature or philosophy. Everything goes by happy 
or unhappy accident. Our universities have poor 
professors who would make admirable instructors 
in the high school, while the high school is filled 
with teachers who have no interest in anything 
but the scholarly aspects of their subjects and 
who therefore belong elsewhere. 
3. Adapting the Teacher to the Sex of the Pu- 
pils. Few teachers succeed equally with girls and 
boys. Some fail absolutely with girls, but succeed 
with boys, and vice versa. We do not know defin- 
itely enough the psychological basis of such 
idiosyncrasies. 
4. Selecting Teachers for the Special Schools. 
Some teachers are only spurred to their best 
efforts by coming face to face with the special 
problems in schools for feeble-minded, incorri- 
gibles, super-normals, etc. Others are balked by 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
any schoolroom problem not explicable in terms 
of common experience. There is no more crying 
need than that of securing special teachers of 
special fitness. 
5. The Spirit of Research versus the Love of 
Teaching. These abilities may, but do not al- 
ways, exist together. The possessor of the mind 
of critical scholarly instincts, wedded to knowl- 
edge for its own sake, may be the veriest Grad- 
grind in his elementary instruction. 
6. The Teacher's Attention Type. Afew teachers 
belong to the extreme “concentrative” type; a 
few to the extreme “distributive” type. The 
former cannot make headway against the con- 
stant eddies of distraction present in high school 
or grade instruction, but may succeed in a uni- 
versity where lectures are prepared in quiet se- 
clusion and delivered without interruption. 
7. Emotional Wealth and Emotional Poverty. 
Undoubtedly the teacher teaches with her emo- 
tions as much as with her intellect. But no one 
has made any serious study of the emotional fac- 
tors that enter into instruction, and how they 
affect it. We do know that an intelligent teacher 
124 
   
-P-A-G-E-141
  RESPONSIBILITY OF NORMAL SCHOOL 
who is also a good disciplinarian and commenda- 
bly conscientious in preparation for her daily 
work may as a teacher prove mechanical and un- 
inspiring to the last degree, — just as there are 
excellent people who cannot raise flowers or coax 
a neglected orange tree into condition. 
8. Leadership and Persuasive Power. This 
differs not only in degree but also in kind. The 
time is ripe for an empirical study of the qualities 
that make for leadership among teachers of vari- 
ous grades and conditions. 
9. The Teacher's Practical Philosophy. Her at- 
titude toward civic and social institutions ; to- 
ward friends, inferiors, superiors, etc.; toward 
children as children ; toward material goods, and 
the like. It will be admitted that all these items 
are important, but how, when, why, and in what 
degree they are important we do not know. 
It is seen, therefore, that vocational guidance 
for the teacher has a positive as well as a nega- 
tive value. Besides rejecting the unfit, it endeav- 
ors to direct each candidate into that type and 
grade of teaching where her strongest qualities 
125 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH 
may be most effective and where her weakest 
may least imperil her success. The task of dis- 
covering the special merits of the teacher and 
placing them where they may work most effi- 
ciently is one of the cardinal problems in the 
hygiene of the occupation. 
A by no means negligible product of any well- 
directed effort toward vocational guidance in the 
normal school will be the cultivation in the young 
teacher of a spirit of self-study and self-criticism, 
which throughout her career should point the 
way to self-improvement, to increased success, 
and to a wholesome spiritual attitude toward the 
inevitable vexations of the profession.

  A CONVENIENT PLAN FOR SECUR- 
ING THE MONOGRAPHS 
Every progressive superintendent and every 
wide-awake teacher will wish to read and study 
the volumes in this Series, as they appear. To 
avoid the necessity of teachers’ sending an order 
for each number of the Series, as issued, the pub- 
lishers will place the names of those who desire 
it on a Subscription List, and the volumes, ag 
they appear, will be sent automatically to each of 
these persons. In this way, one of the best and 
most convenient professional libraries may be 
built up. Those desiring to place their names on 
this Subscription List will please indicate it below, 
in the blank provided for this purpose. 
This page may be detached and returned to the 
publishers at the address given.

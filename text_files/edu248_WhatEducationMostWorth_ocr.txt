  INTRODUCTION 
This book asks a question and tries to give an 
answer. The question is common enough. The answer 
is also common, and one given in several tones. The 
answer lately and generally given affirms that the edu- 
cation which discovers and uses the forces of nature 
has the most worth. The chemical, physical, biological 
sciences, it is declared, constitute an education which 
is most valuable. It is the purpose of this volume to 
appreciate, as best it may, the value of such learning. 
The volume seeks,—however imperfectly —to evaluate 
fairly and justly all the sciences. It recognizes what 
a different world chemistry and physics, either alone 
or co-operating, have made of the world of a hundred 
and fifty years ago. Light, heat, and other forces 
have been discovered, or created, or re-created, in 
unmeasured amounts and to the incalculable benefit 
of man. It recognizes that the applications of bio- 
logical science in medicine, curative or preventive, 
individual or communal, in surgery or in sanitation, 
represent enduring progress in the happiness and 
power of the race. 
But this volume is concerned with other values than

vi Introduction 
those described as scientific or materialistic, as well as 
with those which are scientific. It considers forces 
and relations belonging to nature and also those which 
are human. It is an attempt to prove that the ele- 
ments which form the community of man are at least 
as precious as those which constitute the earth and 
the heavens. It has for its purpose the promotion, 
not simply of “complete living,” in Mr. Herbert Spen- 
cer’s happy phrase, but also highest living. It seeks 
to show that the human studies occupy zones of inter- 
est. and of feeling quite as noble as those which belong 
to the natural zones. It tries to give intimations that 
the inner light has as rich a value as the illuminations 
of electricity. It is a challenge to the effect that the 
philosopher makes as important an offering to life as 
the physiologist, that the poet means as much to his 
age as the physicist, that the great architect does as 
much for his own and for the following generation as 
the bricklayer, that the teacher makes contributions 
to his time at least as valuable as the teamster, and 
that the thinker is as rich an asset as the tinker. 
Indeed, it goes a step further and higher. It is an 
attempt to prove that the spirit of man has more 
worth than his sensations, that the cardinal virtues 
and cardinal graces give more support to humanity 
than the passing opinions of the hour, that the per- 
manent and the profound mean more than the imme- 
diate and the superficial, that literature has greater
-P-A-G-E-7
Introduction vii 
quickening for devout and devoted souls than baseball, 
that man-power is more important than horse-power, 
that man’s most enduring satisfactions are more 
worthy of pursuit than the pleasures of accumulation 
or of appetite, that religion is more serious and more 
constructive than political creeds and partisanship, 
and, in fact, that life is infinitely greater than living. 
In answer to the question of the relative worths 
of different forces or applications of education, these 
chapters seek to offer evidence that the education of 
the intellect is of a value higher than the appreciation 
of executive power. For it is to be acknowledged that 
the present tendency is to depress unduly the worth 
of the intellect and to exaggerate the worth of execu- 
tive or administrative power. Power is a symbol more 
frequently seen and a word more often used than the 
symbol or the word thought. For, the brain is in peril 
of going out of fashion. “High-brow” has become a 
term of disdain. The relative place given in public 
esteem to the intellect is not as high as it was two 
generations ago. The intellect has not so much been 
depressed, as the place of the will has been lifted. The 
relative values have changed. The forces of living, 
of aggressiveness, of doing, of achievement, have got 
far ahead of the directive and guiding powers. Intel- 
lect has gone ahead somewhat, indeed a good deal, but 
the will has come up and gone ahead by leaps and 
bounds. Engineering has supplanted the humanities,
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii Introduction 
the office the study, the business manager the professor 
and the researcher. 
This volume seeks to discover ways or means for 
the readjustment of the content, the conditions, the 
forces, and the methods of education. It tries to point 
out the relatively more important place of the intellect 
than of the executive faculty in man and in man’s 
education. It has for its aim to give evidence that the 
education which has highest value is based on the 
foundation that man himself represents the mightiest 
force, intimates the wisest method, and incarnates the 
richest result,—in fact, that his destiny is eternal and 
infinite. 
It is probable that the suggestion of the volume 
comes, by the law of contrast, from Mr. Spencer’s 
essay, “What Education is of the Most Worth?” The 
title also, by the law of likeness, is borrowed, with a 
slight change, from the title of that historic essay. It 
is not for me to argue with the great man, but it may 
not be wholly unseemly in me to offer certain inter- 
pretations regarding the worth of education which I 
do believe, were he here, would not altogether fail to 
receive his intellectual assent and his general approval. 
For these interpretations are largely based on the prin- 
ciple that education should, as he himself declared, 
quicken “independent activity” and not give support 
to “submissive receptivity.”

TO THE INDIVIDUAL 
Section 1 
The Body 
The medieval idea that in each man the spirit and 
the flesh are natural and inevitable foes has largely 
passed. The purpose and the method of the conflict 
lay not in the increase of the spiritual, but in the 
crucifixion of the physical, force. This purpose, sup- 
planted by the new purpose of making the body, has 
given way to the new method of the training of the 
body itself. As Mr. Herbert Spencer says: “All 
breaches of the laws of health are physical sins.”1 It 
has become recognized that the crucifixion of the 
body creates self-consciousness, an effect which ob-. 
structs growth and development in man. It has also 
become recognized that the perfection of the body pro-

a

motes self-forgetfulness, a resulting condition which 
nourishes sound character. With every faculty in 
good order and with each function doing its proper 
duty, the best physical and other happiness is secured 
in the individual. 
In securing this comprehensive and consummate 
conclusion of physical perfection in man, new diffi- 
culties, however, and difficulties of large relations, 
emerge. The transit from a rural to an urban com- 
munity, the intenser competitions of an industrial and 
commercial state and stage with the quiet conditions 
of an agricultural place and time, the forces of the 
closer neighborhood of families and of individuals, the 
variety of the consuming interests of capital cities, 
form and represent difficulties of the modern urban 
period. These difficulties tend to obstruct the fullest 
and freest development of the body of the individual 
citizen. 
For securing the proper development of the body. 
at least five forces are necessary. They are food, 
exercise, sleep, clothes, fresh air. Man’s food, under 
present conditions, is largely improper, his exercise 
either lacking or unwise, his sleep insufficient and 
irregular, his clothes either too heavy or too slight, 
and the air he breathes more or less poisoned and 
poisonous. 
The food, for those who are of the lower, the high 
school, or college age, should have these characteris-
-P-A-G-E-15
  
To the Individual 3 
tics: It should be sufficient in amount. It should be 
so diverse as to furnish the diverse types of force 
which the body needs. It should supply energy, a 
supply which is given by the carbohydrates, such as 
are found in cereals and in certain vegetables, and in 
the fats. Foods are also designed to build up, or to 
repair, tissue. Such a force is found in meat and eggs 
and milk. Food should also serve to regulate the 
functions of the vital organs and to preserve the 
physical fluids. Food, moreover, should contain sub- 
stances, recently discovered, which are called vita- 
mines. As the name intimates, they are supposed to 
maintain vitality. The diet thus provided should be 
properly, but not too highly, seasoned and concen- 
trated. The body is a ship which requires a certain 
amount of ballast. The ration should also be well 
balanced. With such food, of course, goes along liquid 
refreshment, proper in amount and proper in stimu- 
lation. 
For the health and vigor of the body, wise exercise 
is also to be had. For the country boy or girl, exercise 
is inevitably provided in chores. For the city boy or 
maid, exercise must usually be provided by artificial 
means. Games, sports,—tennis, baseball, football, 
handball,—and the gymnasium, represent the ordi- 
nary means and methods. They are a part of the 
proper education offered by the school or college. They
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
represent the continuance of the element of play which 
belongs to all living beings. In them, each and all, the 
educator is to rejoice, and he is to plan and provide 
for their best execution. 
As necessary as either exercise or food is sleep. Phys- 
iologically, “sleep is a state of more or less complete 
temporary unconsciousness which recurs with a certain 
periodical regularity. The condition is to be found in 
all mammalia and probably in all living things in 
which there are periods of activity alternating with 
periods of rest. This periodicity is one of the most 
difficult features to explain. A similar condition is 
found in the tissues themselves. For example, glands 
are active for a while and then undergo a period, prob- 
ably of reconstruction, to make up for the exhaustion 
during the active stage. Of course, such changes as 
the slowing of the pulse, the slowing and deepening 
of respiration during sleep, are well known. There are 
many other less apparent accompaniments or indica- 
tions of the need of sleep by the organism. Certain 
secretions become diminished. Most of the physi- 
ological activities of the body continue normally dur- 
ing physiological sleep, which, therefore, must have as 
its main function the restoration of the cells of the 
brain. 
“During sleep the intensity is greatest about the end 
of the first hour. The intensity rapidly diminishes
-P-A-G-E-17
  To the Individual 5 
and sleep is very light after three or four hours, but 
there is a second, although diminished, period of inten- 
sity occurring later. This second increase of intensity 
occurs about the end of the tenth hour in the child, 
but at the end of the fifth or sixth in the adult. It 
has been shown that the first short period of intense 
sleep is necessary to restore the brain for simple 
mental acts, but after severe mental strain, efficiency 
is distinctly improved in proportion to the length of 
sleep. 
“Theories of sleep are not very helpful. For that of 
the accumulation of acid waste and for consumption 
of the intramolecular oxygen there is no evidence. 
The toxin theory has some support because the blood 
or cerebro-spinal fluid of dogs kept without sleep for 
long periods when injected into the brain of another 
animal will render it somnolent. The neuron theory 
suggests the retraction of processes of the nerve cells 
with resulting sleep. The Russian, Pawlow, speaks of 
sleep as a process of ‘inhibition.’ One fact which you 
and I know just as well as a physiologist, and a most 
important fact, is that one goes to sleep suddenly and 
all ‘of a piece.’ This can apparently be explained only 
on the basis of cerebral anemia which undoubtedly 
occurs during sleep. Cessation of activity in the vaso- 
motor center during its fatigue is favored by the very 
actions which we take to encourage ourselves to sleep,
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
closing the eyes, darkening the room, and so forth.’? 
The fourth element relative to the health of the 
body is concerned with clothes. Clothing for boys 
and girls in school and college should be hygienic, 
simple, durable, suitable to time and place, and as 
becoming as is right. Its material should be of good 
quality, and it should be free from elaborateness, 
ostentation or show. It should be no more expensive 
than the purse of the wearer can afford. It should 
allow freedom of motion, promote proper ventilation 
of the body, and should be as light in weight as com- 
fort allows. It should also be durable. It should be 
so adjusted to the current modes of dressing that it 
will attract no attention. Vagaries should be avoided. 
The best-dressed person is the person who is so dressed 
that no one notices how one is dressed. 
The fifth point in the quintette of the forces and 
conditions for the care of the body relates to fresh 
air. Nations differ in respect to the desirableness of 
fresh air. The Anglo-Saxon peoples insist upon its 
value; the Romance nations neglect it. American 
girls, who go to French schools, are often obliged to 
sleep in corridors or rooms in which no window is 
open. They at first feel themselves suffocated. French 
girls, who come to American schools, at first find 
themselves sleeping in rooms in which every window

-P-A-G-E-19
  
To the Individual in 
is fully open. For a time they rebel, but presently 
they come to like the custom. Fresh air is a stimulus 
upon which each student should insist. 
In the use of these five forces of the home or of 
the school for the health of the body inhere certain 
dangers. There is the danger of excess, and there is 
the danger also of disproportion among the different 
forms or forces. The excess is more liable to show 
itself in the strain on the heart and in its consequent 
weakness or irregularity of functioning. Men in 
college who have gone in for rowing or other hard 
sports often find it necessary, or at least wise, to con- 
tinue, after graduation, some form of severe exercise. 
Failure thus to continue may prepare the way for the 
degeneration of certain organs in disease, and for ulti- 
mate physical disaster. 
Opposing the use of these forces for the develop- 
ment of the body, one of the more serious foes for the 
boy or young man is found in the habit of smoking. 
Physicians are in agreement that a boy should not 
smoke while he is growing. Growing is a process 
pretty nearly synchronizing with the period of edu- 
cation. Not only is tissue hurt by smoking, but the 
fact that young men use so little judgment in the 
amount of the indulgence adds peril. 
Under all these conditions, the family, the school, 
and the community find special obligations resting on 
_ themselves. These obligations are first to provide
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
adequate examination of the body of every youth. 
Indeed, these examinations may well begin at birth, 
as they do in some families, and continue until the 
end of life. The care given to the eyes, the teeth, and 
other organs, at the entrance to the kindergarten, to 
the high school, and to the college, represents that fore- 
sight which the community properly exercises over its 
young wards. A second obligation relates simply to 
the enforcement, without fear or favor, of the rules 
regarding the necessity of physical examination. Such 
enforcement, of course, should unite the grace of 
courtesy and the virtue of obedience with absolute 
impartiality in the application of the law. 
It may be added that the care of the body, begun, 
continued, and tested, in the score and more of years 
of school and college life, should be further continued 
in the subsequent professional or industrial period. 
For any letting down of these sports or exercises may 
lay upon the different organs of the body and upon 
the heart in particular, certain duties or functions 
which they find themselves unable to perform. It is 
ever to be remembered that the education which has 
the most worth, both as a negative and positive factor, 
covers all the years of life. For the whole length of 
life, it seems at times better to have taken no exer- 
cise at all in the first score of years and to go on in 
this habit, or lack of habit, than to have taken strenu- 
ous exercises in these years and to break off the prac-  
-P-A-G-E-21
To the Individual () 
tice with the end of the school or college period. Such 
a change is too fundamental for the organs to bear.* 
Section 2 
The Mind 
The education which has most worth is an edu- 
cation which nourishes the mind of man. The educa- 
tion which nourishes the mind has several types, 
differing according to the types of men themselves. 
These several types, however, have many elements in

Professor of Political Economy in Yale, and by Dr. Eugene 
Lyman Fisk, give succinctly first-rate commands:

-P-A-G-E-22
  10 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
common. An underlying element relates to the degree 
to which the human mind can be educated. The edu- 
cator accepts minds as they are presented to him. 
His duty begins only with the presentation. His 
responsibility is to do the best with the stuff which 
is offered. If he do well, it is well. If he do ill, it is 
also ill; and if he do nil, the result is also nil. 
One chief difficulty of education, however, is not 
simply the quality or the quantity of the mental power 
itself, but the lack, also, of the desire on the part of 
the student to be educated. The will makes a way. 
When there is no will, there is no way. The union of 
the lack of desire and the actual lack of mental power, 
each part perhaps acting on or reinforcing the other, 
gives a personal result in which the normal educa- 
tional process ceases to serve or to function. The 
normal age of such ceasing falls at thirteen or four- 
teen years. With a not inconsiderable proportion of 
youth, the ceasing begins at an earlier age, with a 
small proportion at a later age, later by a year. It is, 
be it added, only a yet smaller, a very small, propor- 
tion who persist unto the getting of an education of 
the high school or of the college order. 
For all youth, however, there are two elements in 
common which are of peculiar worth. One is the 
element of interestingness and the other of usefulness. 
If education cease at the age of eleven or twelve, it 
becomes education of the hand largely. If education
-P-A-G-E-23
  
To the Individual 11 
go on till the close of the ordinary academic period 
of twenty-two, it should be, and usually is, an edu- 
cation interesting to the person himself, opening to 
him many paths of pleasantness. In this case, it 
should also possess usefulness, a usefulness of the 
highest and broadest degree. Of course, the conse- 
quent usefulness has many forms and types. Each 
is to be accepted at its full value. Among the tests: 
of evaluation are, first, the extent of the worth to the 
whole community; second, the depth of the worth to 
and in the character of the individual; third, the 
diversity of the worth to both the community and the 
individual; and, fourth, the permanence of the worth. 
Many and diverse are the forms of the mind to 
which education gives value, and richest value. 
One form is the interrogative type. It is the earliest 
type in respect to origin. This type is represented in 
the seeker for truth, in the questioner, in the cross- 
examiner of man and of nature. For the child is pri- 
marily the asker of questions. The interrogation point 
is his coat of arms. The best ancient illustration is 
found in Socrates—Socrates, who began his talks with 
the young men of Athens with a question and who 
continued these talks with many and more questions, 
and about all matters. The gadfly, as he represented 
himself as being, often put out its sting in a pointed 
question. The best modern illustration of the ques- 
tioner of nature is Charles Darwin, who sought for
-P-A-G-E-24
  12 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
nature’s secrets, in divine patience, in assured hope- 
fulness, and in ultimate fruitfulness. 
A second type of mind is theintuitive. It sees truth 
with or without conscious seeking, and it sees truth 
directly and immediately. It is the mind of vision or 
of pre-vision: At times, it may seem even to become 
visionariness. It represents the type of mind which 
may be supposed to approach most nearly to the 
method of the Divine Mind in seeing reality. If 
Socrates represents the interrogative type, his pupil, 
loving him as a parent, Plato, may represent the 
intuitive. Though exulting in dialectic, he rejoiced 
more in the immediate vision of the idea. 
Another characteristic of the mind to which edu- 
cation gives value is the_logical. Of this type the 
student of Plato, Aristotle, is the best illustration. 
Yet one almost forbears limiting the most myriad- 
minded man, up to his time, and perhaps of all times, 
to a single field. For Aristotle was not only the 
logician. He was also the metaphysician, the phy- 
sician, the seeker, the rhetorician, the historian of phi- 
losophy. His was the universal mind which accepted 
all knowledge for its province, which ruled Europe as 
with a scepter, through more than a thousand years, 
a mind to which modern thought and scholarship is 
in greater debt than to any other man of any century. 
The logical mind is the mind which reasons. It is the 
mind reasoning from general principles to details, 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
To the Individual 13 
deductive. It is the mind reasoning from details up 
to and into general principles, inductive. It is the 
mind syllogistic, with or without knowledge of the 
syllogism. It is the mind methodical, reasoning with 
the clearness.and inevitableness of geometry, even if 
it have no acquaintance with Euclid. 
The fourth type is the mind reflective. It is the 
mind which thinks about the truth that is received 
and which, in that thinking, discovers new truth. It 
may take on the historical, or the theological, or the 
imaginative, form. It may represent both St. Augus- 
tine or Dante, the two best minds for a thousand years, 
which at once divide and unite two distinct periods. 
The reflective mind includes what I may call the 
assessing type of mind. This type gives, or seeks to 
give, to separate truths a just value, and to secure a 
consequent truthfulness. It is the comparative mind. 
It estimates the more as more, the less as less, the 
least as least, and the most as most. Such a mind is 
juridical, preparing the way for justice, moral and 
political, a type which finds a noble illustration in 
Edmund Burke. 
In contrast with such a form of mind, the reflective, 
the assessing and the just, stands the mind acquisitive. 
It is the mind learning, gathering up knowledge. It is 
the mind rich in fact and truth. Aristotle, as I have 
intimated, is the ancient illustration; Leonardo da 
Vinci represents the learning of the late medieval 
 
-P-A-G-E-26

period; and, be it added, among the illustrations of 
the type in recent times, at least in the historical field, 
is found Lord Acton.* 
There is a sixth type of mind, the mind interpre- 
tative. It is the mind which first seeks to know and 
then to understand, to understand in one relation 
indeed, and in the several other proper relations. It 
exists in contrast to the mind descriptive and pictur- 
esque. It seeks for proportions and for ratios. Its 
intellectual element is vitally united with the ethical. 
The best illustration of such a mind is found in Lord 
Bryce. His, indeed, was the mind inquisitive, and his 
inquisitiveness helped to make his mind acquisitive. 
But both the inquisitiveness and the acquisitiveness 
were related to the superior quality of interpretative- 
ness. 
Intimately associated with the mind interpretative 
is the mind I shall call sympathetic. The sympathetic 
form represents intellect as well as feeling. Minds 
can think alike, as well as hearts feel alike. The sym- 
pathetic mind adopts the point of view which the heart 
presents. It appreciates proportions, relations, con- 
clusions, seeking to learn the reasons on which these 
conclusions are based, and the processes by which 
these conclusions are reached. It supplants the Del- 
phic oracle, “Know thyself,’ by another command,

know the other man. No better illustration of this 
type can be found than the mind of Abraham Lincoln. 
Lincoln, without the learning of the schools, was wise. 
With the experiences of many men of many minds, he 
tried to see with their eyes, to hear with their ears and 
to reason with their reasons. Indeed, the heart gave 
warmth to the intellect, and the intellect helped to 
give vigor and enduring power to the heart. 
The interpretative mind and the sympathetic mind 
find themselves quite akin to what may be called the 
mind appreciative. It is the mind which sees and 
feels the beauty in nature, in art, and in human char- 
acter. It is the type which has peculiar, and even 
unique, pleasure in the grand and sublime, as well as 
in the beautiful. Its test is the pleasure of the beholder 
and of the hearer. Its methods represent the union 
of observation, of comparison, and of reflection. Its 
processes may be called those of emotional intuition. 
The most fitting illustration for the present purpose 
is found in John Ruskin who, despite vagaries of judg- 
ment and emotional extravagances, has lighted lamps 
which ever burn in fullness and fineness. 
Another type is the mind which I shall call the 
experiencing. The experiencing mind is the mind 
which is having, or is capable of having, experiences. 
The phrase is one which ‘Bagehot uses as applied to 
Shakespeare, although he applies it to Shakespeare’s 
nature or manner. It is a mind which is conjugated 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
in the present, or the future, tense, and also in the 
past. For the experiencing mind may be one which 
has had experiences. In the past tense the adjective 
was used on the occasion, two generations ago, of ‘“ex- 
periencing religion.” Whipple, too, writes of Thoreau 
195; as one who had “experienced nature.”® Bagehot’s use 
of the word, moreover, is most fitting. For the mind 
of Shakespeare was, above all minds, the mind that 
was capable of having experiences. He knew without 
ever having learned. ‘Shakespeare was a lawyer,” 
‘ say some. “For no one could have known the law as 
Shakespeare knew it without himself being a lawyer.” 
“He was a doctor,” say others. “For he had a knowl- 
edge of disease and of cures which only a doctor could 
possess.” “No,” declare others, “He was a soldier. 
For he knew wars as only a soldier knows them, and 
much has he to say about preparations for war and 
about the need of caution in making preparations, as 
well as about the spirit suitable for war.” He recog- 
nized war’s loathsomeness and cruelty. Yet, as a fact, 
Shakespeare was neither soldier, nor doctor, nor 
lawyer. For his was a mind of that type which could 
respond to the experiences of war without going to 
camp, which could understand the law without prac- 
ticing the art, and which knew medicine without hold- 
ing a doctor’s certificate. Shakespeare experienced 
life. 
* “Recollections of Eminent Men,” by E. P. Whipple, p. 184.  
-P-A-G-E-29
  To the Individual 17 
Such an experiencing mind belonged to Dante, to 
Milton, to Goethe, but to each less completely than it 
belonged to Shakespeare. 
The experiencing mind has at least four essential, 
constituent characteristics. 
The first is fullness. The experiencing mind is a 
full mind, or has a capacity for fullness, in advance 
of its experience. It is avaricious for knowledge. It 
is hungry for facts. It is zealous for truth. It uses, 
not only Bacon’s reading, but also the chemist’s labora- 
tory, the geologist’s excursion, and the archeologist’s 
exploration. Such a mind was Charles Darwin’s. How 
eager for facts! How intent upon everything his eye 
saw, or ear heard, or hand touched! Each fact might 
be an intimation of a most comprehensive truth, com- 
prehensive in space and in time. 
A second characteristic is animation. The experi- 
encing mind is self-active. It is vital and, therefore, 
vitalizing. It is quick and alive. Its pulse-beats are 
strong without heaviness, and swift without exhaus- 
tiveness. It is dynamic, electric, forceful. It is re- 
mote from the limited, the statical. Such a mind was 
that of Henry Adams. His “Education” proves its 
vitality, progressiveness, its movement toward the 
infinite. Such a mind Theodore Roosevelt possessed. 
It tingled with life. It moved in forcefulness. It was 
an electric battery. A talk with him bore ozone to 
the hearer or participant. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
The third element of the experiencing mind is intel- 
lectual altruism. This mind sees with others’ eyes, 
and hears with others’ ears, understands with others’ 
understanding, feels with others’ feelings, chooses with 
others’ wills. It is vicarious. Such a mind belongs to 
the great teacher, and belongs more fully to him as he 
is the greater. It is the mind which, with all its forces 
of patience and comprehensiveness, the German nature 
did not, ten years ago, and does not to-day, possess. 
As that most competent interpreter, Sir Michael E. 
Sadler, formerly Vice-Chancellor of the University of 
Leeds, and now Master of University College, Oxford, 
has said: “The established system of German educa- 
tion is distinguished by its extraordinary precision of 
aim, by its high standards of intellectual attainment, 
by its liberal encouragement of organized scientific 
research, and by its wide diffusion and convenience of 
access.” But it is selfward, or selfish: it is not intel- 
lectually or ethically altruistic. 
The fourth characteristic of the experiencing mind 
is the power of assimilation. It not only takes in 
experiences superficially, but it makes experiences a 
part of its own intellectual being. It incarnates them, 
or if one prefer, it incarcerates them. These experi- 
ences become elements in its life. The process is not 
theorizing but acceptance, not acceptance but adop- 
tion, not adoption but unification. 
°“German Culture,” edited by Prof. W. P. Paterson, p. 304.
-P-A-G-E-31
  
  To the Individual 19 
There is also the mind constructive. .It is the mind 
which tries to put truths together. It is the mind 
assimilative, and more than assimilative. For it is 
the mind that builds fact unto and into fact, promise 
unto promise, faith unto faith and unto conclusion, 
and every conclusion unto yet another conclusion. It 
is the mind that makes each logical knowing, the be- 
ginning of another logical process. It is the mind 
which sees similarities and seeks to unite them. It is 
the mind which takes the initiative and which still 
goes forward. The mind constructive touches inti- 
mately the volitional forces in character. In political 
science, the best illustration of the type is found in 
Adam Smith. In practical science, Kelvin is the most 
outstanding example; and in metaphysical science, 
  Hegel at once occurs to the philosophic scholar. 
The last type of mind which I name I shall describe 
by the adjective progressive. It is the mind dis- 
contented, dissatisfied with its present condition and 
estate. It has the forward look and the upward vision. 
It is the spirit of the West. We often think, whatever 
be the spirit of the West, that it has the power and 
movement of the rising sun, despite the geographical 
relation! From the good, it looks forward to the 
better, and by its better it ever inspires that which is 
best, and through its best it quickens toward a yet 
better best. A divine discontent fills the soul. Toward 
its golden age such a mind is ever going, and, what
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
is better, never arriving. Each new problem solved 
creates other problems demanding a solution, and so 
forward in the never-ending series. Such a mind has 
its noblest example in Sir Isaac Newton. From the 
day when, as a youth, it was determined that young 
Newton should not be a farmer, as was at first 
planned, down to the close of his long life of more 
than fourscore years, his observations and his studies, 
physical, economical, and theological, ever quickened 
the sense of going on, of progressiveness. 
The education which has the most worth will be 
concerned with each of these several types of mind. It 
will quicken inquisitiveness while it answers questions. 
It will train the mind to immediate insight. It will 
educate the mind unto the logical, reasoning process. 
It will develop reflectiveness. It will endeavor to 
secure knowledge, fact, truth. It will be eager to give 
to the acquisitive mind the sense of interpretation. It 
will not refrain from seeking to train the mind sym- 
pathetic, both in and of itself, and also in its relations 
to the emotional character. It will thus educate the 
mind appreciative of nature, of art, and of personality. 
It will recognize the value of the experiencing type, 
even while by education it seeks to do away with the 
need of this form. It will train unto the power of con- 
structiveness. It will also, with all its training and 
education, quicken the individual unto the forward 
look and endeavor in noble progressiveness.

Section 3 
The Heart 
Man has, and is, a heart, as well as a body and a 
mind. The word stands for that complex called feel- 
ings or emotions. It means the man feeling. The 
education which has the most worth is an education 
which gives to this condition the fullest content and 
the wisest direction. The heart stands for love and 
for hate, for trust and for iear, for complacency and 
for anger, for satisfaction and for disgust, for wonder 
and for indifference, for courage and for timidity, for 
commendation and for reproach, for satisfaction and 
for jealousy, for reward and for revenge, for reverence 
and for contempt, for purity and for baseness, for 
joy and for sorrow, for desire and for aversion, for 
humility and for pride, for hope and for despair. Love 
is to be cherished and hate curbed. Trust is to be 
nourished and fear cast out, complacency to be edu- 
cated and anger to be averted, satisfaction to be in- 
creased and disgust crushed, wonder to be trained and 
indifference to be quickened, courage to be made yet 
more courageous and wise, and timidity to be for- 
gotten, contentment with the good to be augmented, 
and revenge and jealousy to be killed, reverence to 
be trained and contempt made weak, purity to become 
yet further ennobled, and baseness dissipated, humility 
to be appreciated and pride cast out, desire for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-34

good ever to be emphasized and aversions properly 
adjusted, hope to be lifted, and despair in life’s affairs 
expelled, joy in gift and achievement, in condition and 
personality, to be deepened and made yet more con- 
structive, and sorrow to become the exception in life. 
Such is the program for and of the heart of man. It 
is an interpretation of Christ’s beatitudes. It repre- 
sents the faith, hope, and love of St. Paul. It is to 
constitute the essence of life. Of these emotions, some 
are simple and some complex, some fundamental and 
some superficial, some comprehensive and some nar- 
row, some original and some derived. But of them 
all, love is the simplest, the most comprehensive and 
fundamental, and the most original. Love is the great- 
een is at once a passion,\a feeling, an emotion, 
a sehsation. Love never faileth. Whether it be de- 
rived from an instinct in man or from his will is a 
minor problem in contrast with its ultimate dominance 
and enduring worth. 
The methods for applying or using these feelings 
are considered in a following chapter. In the para- 
graphs of this chapter, the presence of these emotions 
is recognized and their place and power and number 
as constituting results of the most precious education 
intimated. For it is true, as the great James writes in 
his treatment of the emotions: 
“Tf one should seek to name each particular one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
To the Individual 23 
them of which the human heart is the seat, it is plain 
that the limit to their number would lie in the intro- 
spective vocabulary of the seeker, each race of men 
having found names for some shade of feeling which 
other races have left undiscriminated.’” 
Section 4 
The Will 
In the preceding section, I have written of love as 
an emotion. But love is not an emotion only. It is 
also a choice, a choice of the will, the choice of a good 
will, in man. Man choosing, man willing, represents 
a field of education wherein the human will is to be 
grown. For, will represents and forms more than any 
other faculty, or function,—character. A good will is 
a good character, bad bad. The love to one’s neighbor 
which is commended by Christ in the Gospels is not 
a sensation, a feeling, a passion. It is rather an act 
or a habit of the man willing. It represents choosing 
another’s good to a degree in which one chooses good 
for one’s self. Such individual act, or such constant 
activity, is of the most worth for the individual and 
for humanity. 
For volitions tend to form or to become habits. 
They set a sort of personal example which the indi- 
*“Psychology,” by William James, Vol. II, p. 485.
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
vidual himself follows. His companions are less liable 
to follow the example thus set than he is himself. 
There are three principles, or applications of princi- 
ples, which William James intimates as belonging to 
habit formed by the will. “The first result of it 
is that habit simplifies the movements required to 
achieve a given result, makes them more accurate and 
diminishes fatigue.”® “The next result is that habit 
diminishes the conscious attention with which our acts 
are performed.”® “A third maxim may be added to 
the preceding pair: Seize the very first possible oppor- 
tunity to act on every resolution you make, and on 
every emotional prompting you may experience in the 
direction of the habits you aspire to gain.”?° 
The answer given to the age-long discussion, whether 
the will be free or determined, as a theory, has as little 
practical value for the ordinary man in his common 
choices, as have the theories of the existence or non- 
existence of an exterior world. But the fact that 
volitions tend to. become habits, and that habits form 
character, and that character apparently constitutes 
destiny, has inexpressible value to the thoughtful man. 
The education, therefore, which has relation to the 
will, is of supreme significance.

Section 5 
The Conscience 
What has been already written, regarding man as 
a knowing and thinking, as a feeling, and as a willing, 
being, becomes united in a consideration of him as a 
moral being. Man as a moral being is concerned with 
right and wrong as qualities of acts or of processes. 
The elements which constitute right or wrong represent 
annals covering at least twenty-five hundred years of 
direct historic discussion. The theories considered are 
many and as diverse as are selfishness and altruism. 
Such diversity and such a history help to prove, and 
do illustrate, the fundamental value of morality to 
the human species. For such morality represents man 
as thinking about the ethical qualities of acts, as feel- 
ing an impulse to accept what he regards as good and 
to avoid what he regards as bad, and as choosing that 
which he regards as right, and refusing that which he 
regards as wrong. And, further, it is evident that man 
has a feeling of satisfaction over the choice of the 
right, and of remorse,—if he does make it,—over the 
choice of the wrong. Such is the briefest outline of 
the moral act or process, applied to and by the indi- 
vidual. Multiply those processes a million- or a bil- 
lion-fold and there is made a picture of the moral 
processes or condition of mankind. The moral con- 
dition of mankind becomes embodied in laws, customs,
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
and procedures. These laws, customs, and procedures 
represent the communal habit, or habits. These com- 
munal habits, in turn, react on the individual or the 
community and help to form or transform the com- 
munity or the individual. When they embody the 
cardinal virtues, they make a great and noble society. 
When they fail to embody these virtues, they are at 
once the constituting elements and the marks of bar- 
barism. 
With the giving to man, as a being possessed of 
moral sentiments, that education which has the most 
worth, the school and the college are profoundly con- 
cerned. The conditions and the methods for giving 
this education await consideration in a forthcoming 
chapter. 
Section 6 
The Sense of Beauty 
There are two other forms or elements of man’s 
spiritual constitution which deserve special considera- 
tion. They are the sense of beauty and the sense of 
religion. For beauty and religion do occupy important 
places, and places apart, although in certain relations 
similar. 
The sense of beauty belongs primarily to the intel- 
lect. Man is fundamentally a perceiving agent. Yet 
from this perception there follow the conditions of the 
feeling of awe, of pleasure, and of exultation. The
-P-A-G-E-39
To the Individual 27 
will, or the executive faculty, has no share in these 
conditions. To a small number, though a number of 
the most thoughtful type, beauty makes a peculiar 
appeal. The appeal shows itself in the appreciation 
of the fine arts. Of all the fine arts, music makes an 
appeal to the larger number, and the appeal is more 
moving to the emotions than is either painting or 
sculpture or architecture or poetry. It is at once 
evident that poetry has peculiar affinities with music. 
If sculpture and painting and architecture represent 
coexistence in space, music represents succession in 
time. Music, too, has deeper and more numerous in- 
tellectual affiliations than any other of the fine arts. 
For Lord Balfour,-—that most erudite of all minds of 
the present time, which might be called a public mind, 
—has said: 
“There is another most interesting peculiarity of 
music from the philosophic point of view, which is 
that of all the arts it seems to be more intimately con- 
nected with what I may call dry scientific facts. You 
can state in terms of mathematical physics certain 
very important truths with which music is intimately 
connected; and at first sight it might seem, therefore, 
as if science was to give you some assistance in build- 
ing up a theory of musical aesthetics. I confess my 
own opinion is that that belief will prove to be illusory. 
The circumstance to-which I have adverted is a most 
interesting fact. It separates music from all the other
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
arts and puts it on quite a separate basis. And 
although I do not believe that out of the mathematical 
theory of the scale or of the chords, or of the theory 
of harmony, you can ever deduce anything in the 
nature of a true musical aesthetic, still, this intimate 
relation with mathematics and physics puts it upon 
entirely separate ground.” 
In the United States, music has been regarded, too 
generally, as an extra in education. It has been held to 
be exoteric. It has stood for an “accomplishment” 
only. It has not been treated as an integral part of 
education. It has not been interpreted as an essential 
part either of historical or of present value. It be- 
longs, however, to the fundamental. The principle of 
rhythm represents one of the earliest rules of pro- 
cedure of fhe human race. It stands for one of the 
more erudite elements of the human character. It has 
an important place in two of the most complex of all 
the sciences, mathematics and physics. It is no longer 
to be regarded as a Cinderella, at times petted with 
understanding and at times put out of the educational 
house as unworthy of companionship with the true and 
the good. It does, however, deserve a place in the 
school and college curriculum by the side of the funda- 
mental knowledges. But, deserving such a place, it 
also should command masters of the type of the great 
4 “The Mind of Arthur James Balfour,” p. 217.

teachers of the sciences, of history, and of the Greek 
language and literature. 
Section 7 
The Sense of Religion 
In the consideration of the education which has the 
most worth, a place is to be given to religion. Man 
is naturally, inevitably, religious. So fundamental is 
religion to man that its nature and relation to him is 
to be included in an interpretation of the education 
which is most worthy. Without apology, let me at 
once say that the religion which I have in mind is the 
Christian. Other systems—Buddhism, Islamism, Con- 
fucianism—have their place. But for us the review 
is to be limited to a single faith. Yet, be it added, 
almost in a parenthesis, many elements of the Chris- 
tian faith are essentially identical with the elements 
of other systems. In this faith the fundamental ele- 
ment and the controlling force is the doctrine of God. 
The God of the Christian system is a Person; a Per- 
son, for He has reason, conscience, and free will. If 
His reason be infinitely wise, if His conscience be 
perfect, and if His will be omnipotent, such infinities 
do not forbid His personality. God, the atmosphere 
in which we live and move, and have our being; God, 
the energy of which all forces are only forms, adapta- 
tions and applications—an energy which had no be-
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ginning and, apparently, likewise has no end; God, 
whose knowledge is omniscience; God, who was in the 
beginning and whose ending is inconceivable—eternal; 
God, who fills infinite space, as He fills and trans- 
mutes all time into eternity with His presence; God, 
who, being before the beginning, did in the begin- 
ning create; who came into time, and who, being in 
space, made space with His creation visible, tangi- 
ble; God, who as a Creator made what seemed to 
Him good—a power working for righteousness; God, 
the beneficent, who was, and is, and shall be, love: 
such is the interpretation of the fundamental doctrine 
of the religious education which is of the most worth 
to the individual. Religion is the relation which 
man holds to such a being. This relation is the 
most important of all relations. For it touches the 
infinities. Respecting the methods and responsibilities 
for nourishing this relation, I shall write presently. 
But, at this moment, I am concerned only with the 
fact itself. To seek to eliminate this relation from 
any scheme of education is essentially folly. To 
endeavor to include it and properly to interpret and 
to apply it, even without securing all desirable results, 
is the highest wisdom. This education is an education 
which will give to the body of man soundness, with 
the proper play and work of every faculty, to the mind 
of man the largest development of each of its several 
types, to the emotions the control of the worthiest and
-P-A-G-E-43
To the Individual 31 
the elimination of the unworthy, to the volitional 
nature the training of well-directed force, to the moral 
sentiments the uniting of both emotions and volitions, 
with the cultivation of the cardinal virtues and veri- 
ties; to the aesthetic sense a keen appreciation of 
beauty, especially in music as an integral part of 
education; to the sense of religion right relations to 
Him in whom we live and move and have our being. 
An education which makes such enrichment of the life 
of the individual, offering noblest contributions to the 
cultivation of his character, has indeed the highest 
worth. It is an education which appeals to the making 
of a life, and not simply to the making of a living. 
It is an education which appeals to man as an im- 
mortal being, as well as a mortal one. It is an edu- 
cation which belongs to the fundamental and essential 
parts of his being, as well as to those elements which 
bring him into relationship with his fellows. 
To the consideration of these social relations as a 
field for the education of most worth, we at once 
proceed.

Section 1 
The Family 
The community represents all men. 
into various groups. Man is divided into men, and 
men set themselves up into several bodies or forces. 
The more fundamental and important of these groups 
are the family, the state, society, and the church. To 
each of these groups, as well as to the individual, 
belongs an institution called property to which edu- 
cation bears a serious relationship. This relationship 
is of peculiarly vital significance in the present critical 
social condition. 
The most historic of these diverse groups is the 
family. To the family, education which is of the most 
worth owes three duties: first, the duty of emphasizing 
the fundamental character of the family of the past, 
of the present, and of the probable future.

clear that the present contemporary family is the

-P-A-G-E-45
To the Community 33 
result of a long, diverse, and hard struggle. The 
higher education should make clear to the student the 
historic significance of the institution of the family. 
A second duty of education is to teach the equality of 
the two constituting partners of the family. The prin- 
ciples of justice lead us to give to the wife an authority 
equal to that of the husband. The subordination of 
the woman to the man in the marriage relation is the 
only example remaining among Anglo-Saxon peoples 
of the subjection of one individual of full mental 
powers to another, on account of the accident of birth. 
In the beginning, this subordination was based upon 
the right of the stronger as were slavery, feudalism, 
and absolute monarchy. In rude and barbarous times, 
it was, perhaps, fitting that woman should be under 
the protection, and, to a degree, the authority, of those 
men who were able and willing to protect her against 
such men as found in her weakness and sex a tempta- 
tion to their passions. Such reasons can no longer be 
urged for the continuance of this subjection on one 
side, or of this authority on the other. Nowhere in 
civilized lands is brute force now recognized as the 
basis of personal power. As marriages exist to-day, 
the average woman is at least the equal of her husband 
in mental power and attainments; her judgment is as 
trustworthy as his, and should have equal weight in 
the decision of such matters as affect the well-being 
of the family.
-P-A-G-E-46
34 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
Furthermore, the contribution which the wife makes 
to the family is equivalent to that of the husband. 
She gives her time, her strength, her labor as does he. 
The sacrifices of personal ambitions and of pleasures 
which she makes are at least as great as his. The 
interests of the family are hers as truly as they are 
his. By no principle of justice can an equal voice be 
denied to her in all family councils and decisions; 
much less can she be personally subordinated to him. 
The third duty which education owes respecting the 
family is to teach the proper relationship of parents 
and children. Every child has as his first right the 
right to be well born. He may justly demand of his 
parents that he be brought into the world under such 
conditions as are best fitted to give him physical, in- 
tellectual and moral strength. This truth ought to be 
self-evident; yet the fear that this obvious right of 
the child is almost totally neglected by even those 
whom we call the best parents, is the excuse for its 
present interpretation and emphasis. Every parent 
who dares to take upon himself the awful responsi- 
bility of calling a human life into being, who places 
himself in God’s hand as the instrument of divine 
creative power, assumes a trust which should exclude 
every form of selfishness. She who lends herself as 
the shrine of a newly-awakened soul, whose life has 
become overshadowed by the Most High, is no longer 
her own. The life which she bears within her own 
 
-P-A-G-E-47

has the first right to her thought and care. A child 
can be no more foully wronged than to be conceived 
in a moment of thoughtless indulgence, borne in a 
spirit of undisguised rebellion or nameless dread, and 
brought forth in heaviness of soul. 
Beyond the right of being well born, every child 
has also the right to the best training his parents can 
give. He has the right to the personal care of both 
father and mother, a care which can never be largely 
delegated to others without serious loss to both parents 
and child. The sympathy and love existing between 
the father and child is quite different from that exist- 
ing between the mother and child. To lose either is 
to take from the life of the child elements of power, 
virtues and graces which nothing can replace. In our 
modern urban life, the home too often becomes the 
lodging-house of the father and the social headquarters 
of the mother. The child loses that intimate associa- 
tion with his parents which forms the natural means 
for developing his character. Such association is his 
surest safeguard against yielding to temptation. To 
be fed and clothed are among the minor rights which 
children may demand of parents. It is their superior 
right to learn from their parents, both by precept and 
example, those principles of truth, of honor, of per- 
sonal purity in thought and life, which constitute a 
heritage and a possession of incalculable worth. Such 
instruction can be left to no intellectual teacher, how- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48

ever faithful; to no religious guide, however devoted. 
The parent owes proper teaching and training to the 
child for whose existence he is responsible. 
In the consideration of the relation of the parent 
and child, and emphasizing the toil and the self-sacri- 
fice which the faithful father and mother cheerfully 
give for their child, one may easily depreciate the 
duties which the child owes the parent. Whatever 
may be these duties, it cannot be overlooked that the 
parent owes far more to the child than the child to 
the parent. The duties of children may be briefly 
comprehended in obedience and confidence. Every 
father and mother have not only the right to claim 
obedience from their children; it is, moreover, their 
duty to enforce obedience. Submission to higher 
powers is the only basis for strong, free, developed 
manhood and womanhood. The restraints of law, 
civil and divine, bear heavily only on those who, un- 
disciplined by early parental restraint, have never 
learned obedience to domestic law. For the sake of 
the child, no less than for their own, parents should de- 
mand prompt and implicit obedience. They should 
likewise expect to receive the confidence of their chil- 
dren in all concerns. Absolute truthfulness, with no 
evasion, no prevarication, no concealment; absolute 
trustfulness of each in the other, born of the sympathy 
of the parent with the child and of the love of the 
child for the parent,—this is the ideal in the relation
-P-A-G-E-49
  To the Community 37 
of the son or of the daughter to those who stand in 
the place of God Himself. 
The family, as now crganized, is beset by three 
perils: first, the growth of individualism; second, the 
secularization of marriage; third, changes in the social 
and political condition of women. For the meeting of 
these perils certain forces are, however, to be com- 
mended. These perils are not to be met by minor 
forces such as the uniformity of divorce laws, but they 
are rather to be met and overcome by a most funda- 
mental, central element in humanity. This element 
is the element of the divine character of human life. 
Upon this character, or characteristic, emphasis should 
be placed with all possible force. For man is more 
than nature, his destiny more than his environment. 
The animate is more precious than the inanimate. 
The origin of man in God, the continuance of man’s 
life in God, the destiny of man’s life in God, are the 
understandings which represent the primary methods 
for overcoming the diverse perils of the home. 
Section 2 
The State 
The State is or represents the people joined together 
in a civil or political unity. “An aggregate of men 
living together in a single community and united by 
mutual interests and relationships we term a Society. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
When there is created a supreme authority to which 
all the individuals of this society yield a general 
obedience, a State is said to exist. The social body 
becomes, in other words, a Body Politic. The in- 
strumentalities through which this superior authority 
formulates its will and secures its enforcement is 
termed a Government; the commands it issues are 
designated Laws; the persons that administer them, 
Public Officials, or collectively, a Magistracy; the 
whole body of individuals, viewed as a political unit, 
is called a People; and finally the aggregate of rules 
and maxims, whether written or unwritten, that define 
the scope and fix the manner of exercise of the powers 
of the State, is known as the Constitution. The State 
itself then is neither the People, the Government, the 
Magistracy, nor the Constitution. Nor is it indeed 
the territory over which its authority extends. It is 
the given community of given individuals, viewed in 
a certain aspect, namely, as a political unity.”1 To 
this unity is to be given an education having the most 
worth. Such an education is, first, to teach the re- 
sponsibilities and the duties of citizenship. Whether 
the State be monarchical, oligarchical, republican, 
democratic, the individual owes to the government of 
the State certain duties. In the republican, or the

loughby, pp. 3-4. (Quoted in “The Government of Modern 
States,” by W. F. Willoughby, pp. 5-6.)

  To the Community 39 
democratic, system, the value of rights has been em- 
phasized, and the worth of liberty and liberties eulo- 
gized. The emphasis is just and the eulogy is usually 
deserved. But the time has now come in political 
history and procedure to emphasize duty and duties, 
and to interpret and impose responsibilities. A great 
leader, in American higher and lower education, has 
said: “They [the States] must know the value of free 
thought, but they must remember that the quantity of 
real liberty which people enjoy is likely to be propor- 
tioned to the quantity of restraint they will suffer, if 
the schools would fulfill their mission and develop 
respect for the law, while they impress upon youth the 
invaluable prerogatives of American citizenship and 
the awful responsibility of the exercise of govern- 
mental power. ... In framework and in object they 
are striving to afford the fullest opportunity for indi- 
vidual improvement, and assure the uniform intellec- 
tual and moral advancement of the whole mass. Their 
constitutions are more representative of the growth of 
constitutional freedom, and its resulting incentives to 
the intellectual and moral evolution of the multitudes, 
than any other written documents in the history of 
the human race.”* The education which has the most 
worth is of this type, stating, interpreting, and em- 
phasizing, the duties and rights of the republican 
democracy.

  40 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
The education of this type will have one great 
fundamental and crowning advantage. It will train 
men unto leadership in society. A note frequently 
struck in the songs of the Commencement season, and 
constantly emphasized in book and editorial article, 
is a note of the loss of leadership in the community. 
The charge thus made is true. For, compare the 
year of 1874 with the period fifty years after; limit 
the comparison to one field only, the field of literature. 
The Cambridge poets were singing. Lowell had, a 
few years before, read his great Commemoration Ode, 
and was yet to read other great commemorative verse. 
Longfellow, inditing sweet songs of the child and of 
the childhood of the race, was chanting the Psalm of 
Life in many metres. The Concord essayists were 
interpreting. Emerson was giving forth those essays 
which, rich fruitage in themselves, were to ripen as 
seeds of the highest thought and purest feeling of 
America and of the world. To-day, who are the poets, 
or the essayists, of corresponding influence or afflu- 
ence? 
Lord Bryce says: “Those who have compared the 
public life of France from 1815 to 1875 with its public 
life from 1870 to 1920, and that of the United States 
of the years 1850-1900 with that of later years, seem 
disappointed with the results. Similar complaints are 
heard from those who in England set the generation

of Burke, Pitt, and Fox, and that of Peel, Disraeli, 
and Gladstone beside the England of later years.’”* 
For the forces of the great body of the people, forces 
of a democratic state, forces economic, industrial, civil, 
political, literary, forces held in common by all, have 
forged far ahead of the forces directing, guiding, con- 
trolling these collective powers. The forces of the 
mass of the people have become mightier than the 
power of the press, of the pulpit, of the government, 
legislative, judicial, executive. Science, indeed, rules 
the laboratory. It does not rule the thoughts of men. 
Witchcraft is as common as philosophy in guiding 
men’s thinking. The phrase “high brow” means the 
intellectual, and the words have become a taboo; 
many men have come to scorn and to spurn the intel- 
lectual itself. The moving picture, appealing to the 
sensuous in the mind and often to the evil in the heart, 
has supplanted the spoken drama, appealing to reason 
and to good taste. The love of amusements is substi- 
tuted for reverence. Organized emotion, or emotion 
unorganized, has taken the place or reflective intellect. 
not only to develop the forces of the individual state 
and nation through leadership and other methods, but 
also will endeavor to promote all good ‘relations be- 
tween different nations. All nations are joined together

by ties visible, and even more by ties that are invisible. 
No nation lives or prospers or suffers or dies unto 
itself alone. International gossamer threads of per- 
sonal relations and of informal societies are often 
stronger than the steel cables of treaties and of con- 
ventions. The imponderables have tremendous weight. 
Financial exchanges, community exchanges, ex- 
change of students and professors, exchange of all the 
forces that constitute civilization, are more important 
than are the formal relations of formal governments. 
These formal and informal relationships arise from, 
lead to, and are comprehended in, a common interpre- 
tation in which each nation, while acting for its own 
welfare, never seeks to overthrow its rivals. Despite 
the difficulties which prevent nations holding relation- 
ships to other nations, it is nevertheless true that the 
time will ultimately come when the battle flags shall 
be furled. The relations of nations to each other will 
finally come to take on the high standards which 
govern individuals in relation to each other. It is for 
the education which has highest value to do its utmost 
to promote the dawn of that day of full international 
knowledge, of mutual respect, and of peaceful and 
beneficent cooperation. Whatever may be the value of 
the League of Nations,—and I believe that value to be 
great,—there is no question as to the value of a league 
of nations.

Society 
If the State is society organized under civil and 
political forms, society is the State unorganized. The 
education which is of the most worth to society, it 
may be said, negatively, is not that which has for its 
method, content, and aim, the purpose of giving plea- 
sure or the grace of charm, commanding as pleasure is 
or beautiful as is the grace of charm. Positively, the 
education needed for society is the education which 
creates and nourishes thinking, thoughtfulness, and 
reflection. It is an education which is not more 
scholastic, but more scholarly, not giving wider gen- 
eral knowledge, but deeper eagerness for intellectual 
  e for learn-   
accuracy, not so much inspired by the d 
ing as quickened by the spirit of contemplation. 
Society needs less articulati in speech than artic- 
  ulation in thinking. It needs more of logic, both 
inductive and deductive, than eloquence, a greater 
development of its depths and heights than extension 
in its horizons. It needs less of Chesterfield’s Letters 
than of Mill’s chapters on Fallacies. It does not want 
ecclesiasticism, of which it has enough, but it does 
need religion. It is often devoted to altar-cloths, to 
orders, to ritual, to stateliness in architecture, to eccle- 
siastical good manners, and to forms of worship. Of 
such let not a depreciative word be spoken, But it 
 
-P-A-G-E-56

needs much, more, most, the ancient sacrifice of the 
humble and the contrite heart. 
Section 4 
The Church 
Such sentiments bring one to consider the kind of 
education which the church most needs or may give. 
Men have organized themselves into the church. The 
church represents or incarnates religion. The church, 
under many forms and divers names, embodies the 
religious force and forces. The types of its education 
are to be at once differentiated. One type, theology, 
will be considered in a future section. Education in the 
science and art of charity, as a function of the church, 
can also be eliminated from these pages. For charity 
as a form of communal service has largely become a 
function of specially equipped departments. Parochial 
education, that is the education of the children of 
the church, belongs also to another field. The educa- 
tion, therefore, of the church as a church, is the edu- 
cation of the great body of its members and adherents. 
For this body is a great body, embracing in its 
two hundred branches a large share of all people. 
This body needs education in at least three respects. 
It needs, first, to know its sacred books. Its sacred 
books are embraced in what is called the Bible. Of 
the Bible its members are ignorant, The book is com-
-P-A-G-E-57
  To the Community 45 
posed of history covering more than two thousand 
years. This part is comparatively unknown to the 
laity. It is composed of Psalms and Songs. They, 
too, are unfamiliar. . It is composed of biographies, 
reports of teachings and addresses. But many parts 
of these diverse records are to most a sealed book. It 
is composed of doctrines, of counsels, of exhortations. 
With these interpretations, also, many members have 
no acquaintance. The scriptures of the Old Testa- 
ment and of the New the church needs to learn. The 
church, secondly, needs to be educated in a knowledge 
of its own history and literature. It is a history of 
the most important institutions of man. Immediately 
one might say its history forms important annals of 
man himself, at least in and from his origins, and 
in a development of the Greek, Roman, and Hebrew 
civilizations. Its influences are formative, its annals 
both shameless and glorious, its movements tremen- 
dous, its leaders commanding. To such a history, 
the membership should give heed. The church, more- 
over, thirdly, needs education in its beliefs. Its mem- 
bership should possess an understanding of its general 
principles and relationships. For its adherents do not 
understand its dogmas, nor apprehend the significance 
of its creeds, nor appreciate the elements and forms 
of its devotions. Its temples are more numerous and 
impressive than are the hospitals for healing, than are 
the court-houses for administering justice, than are
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
the prisons for punishing the criminal and restraining 
the delinquent. Yet the education of its membership 
is wanting in the knowledge of the facts and teaching 
of its sacred books, in the appreciation of its history, 
in the understanding of its devotions. The church 
should come into a proper understanding of itself as a 
subject and an agent of education.

CONTENT 
Section 1 
General Considerations 
Important as are the character and environment of 
the individual and of the community, to which edu- 
cation of the most worth is given, equally important 
is the nature of the content of this education. With 
the content is united, to a degree at least, the question 
of condition and of method. Certain provisional con- 
siderations, however, should be distinctly stated. 
Among these considerations are: First, education is 
to be had in and through the school. Education in 
the family and by a tutor is subject to several serious 
objections—(a) It is costly. Even if the individual 
home can afford the expense, yet one is ever to recog- 
nize that individual expenses are ultimately met by 
the whole community. (b) It is liable to be solitary 
and secluded, separating the student from his fellows. 
(c) It lacks the quickening motives and appreciations 
of comradeship and competition. It wants the influ- 
47
-P-A-G-E-60
48 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ence of mind over mind, of will over will, of person- 
ality over personality. 
Second: A second preliminary remark relates to 
the brevity of the educational process. For most 
students, it covers less than seven years, and, deduct- 
ing vacations and holidays, it represents about one- 
half of this length of time. After the age of ten, the 
education, or environment, of boys and girls is like 
the march of the swiftly retreating army. Its move- 
ment is marked by loss. The number who finally 
receive the A. B. degree is less than one per cent of 
those who enter the kindergarten. 
Third: It is also to be acknowledged that the intel- 
lectual possibilities, for a really appreciable number 
of the pupils, of receiving an education are small. The 
idiot, the moron, the defective, and the delayed, rep- 
resent sad, and many, human strata. Perhaps ten per 
cent of all children could be placed in one of these 
four classes. Of course, among the normally born and 
the normally constituted, degrees of intellectual power 
are to be recognized. 
Fourth: A further prolegomenon vitally connected 
with the preceding remark is that at some point in 
the educational program a differentiation of pupils 
should be made, a differentiation based on their abili- 
ties and probable future callings. Accepting a large 
common denominator of education, yet the numerator 
of individual power and place is to be made. The
-P-A-G-E-61
  Content 49 
plumber is not to be educated as is the physician, nor 
the carpenter as the editor, nor the plasterer as the 
architect. 
Fifth: The last provisional consideration concerns 
the fact that the amount of the community’s money 
to be allotted to education is small. The money ap- 
propriated for war, for example, is great compared to 
that set aside for education. The cost of a single 
battle-ship is greater than the endowment of the rich- 
est university of the world, and the cost of its running 
for a year is as large as the annual budget of Harvard, 
Yale, or Columbia. The cost of the tobacco and of 
the cosmetics for the American people for twelve 
months equals the cost of their education. The pro- 
portion is bad, and it is made bad and also sad by 
reason of the preferences of the people. The cheap 
physical appetites are more commanding and expen- 
sive than the intellectual satisfactions. 
On the basis of the five points of this educational 
Calvinism, one may seek to interpret the worth of the 
several subjects taught in the schools as means for 
getting that education which has the most worth. The 
subjects are easily divided into those that belong to 
man and those that belong to the exterior world. They 
may be called, in a general way, the humanities and 
the sciences. Mathematics may be said to belong to 
both fields, and theology to one and to one only, and 
perhaps only in part to this one.

Section 2 
Mathematics 
Mathematics has both the difficulties and the charm 
of the human, as well as of the scientific, subjects. 
As an applied study, it belongs to the humanities. As 
pure mathematics, it takes its place with the sciences. 
For most minds, its hardness is found in its abstract 
side. For it lacks content or quantity which would 
carry it over to the grasp of the understanding of the 
ordinary student. On its applied side, it has interest 
for most minds of the logical type. Its value to many 
as a subject of education does not go beyond geometry 
or trigonometry, or may end even before algebra be 
reached. Of course, arithmetic is a tool, is constantly 
useful, facile in its processes, and should be promoted. 
But to all, mathematics gives a sense of the inevitable- 
ness of fact and of inference, an inevitableness of the 
utmost worth to the mind and the will of both the 
individual and of the community. 
Srction 3 
Languages and Literatures 
Of the so-called humanities, the languages and the 
literatures are of primary value. They are, at least 
the languages, tools as well as elements of power and 
of culture, To be able to speak well and to write well

is an instrument first in time and first in importance. 
Language has unique force, and the ancient languages 
in particular have power of the greatest worth. Of 
the ancient languages, none is so useful as Latin. As 
Schopenhauer, that profound and erratic interpreter, 
has said: “The abolition of Latin as the universal 
language of learned men, together with the rise of that 
provincialism which attaches to national literatures, 
has been a real misfortune for the cause of knowledge 
in Europe. For it was chiefly through the medium of 
the Latin language that a learned public existed in 
Europe at all—a public to which every book as it 
came out directly appealed. The number of minds in 
the whole of Europe that are capable of thinking and 
judging is small, as it is; but when the audience is 
broken up and severed by differences of language, the 
good these minds can do is very much weakened.”* 
Literature, behind which lies language as a con- 
dition and support, is a fine art of greater worth than 
any other. In it are incarnated the best that man has 
thought and felt. It forms the noble record of his 
noble achievement. To be acquainted with it, to ap- 
preciate its principles and to understand its develop- 
ments, to enter by sympathy into the soul of its 
creators, represent the means of education which 
quickens the mind, enlarges the character, deepens and

of Latin,” from “The Art of Literature,” p. 31.

purifies the sources of enjoyment, increases the power 
of man. It is sometimes thought that the fine arts 
are so fine that they necessarily lack force, and that 
they are devoid of substance. It is believed by some 
that crudeness spells strength, coarseness virility, and 
roughness power. Such interpretations are as super- 
ficial as they are false. Literature itself helps to prove 
their falseness. For literature possesses both fineness 
and force, both substance and form, both art and 
power. It unites the scientific principles of archi- 
tecture and of music with the beauty of painting and 
of sculpture. It joins together, under its one name, 
poetry, creations as unlike as are the “Iliad,” “Para- 
dise Lost,” Shelley’s “Sky Lark,” and Tennyson’s “In 
Memoriam.” 
In the education which has the most worth for the 
modern man and men, a large place is to be given to 
literature and language, and particularly to the litera- 
ture of England. English literature is an educative 
tool and force for several fundamental reasons. It 
is the embodiment of the noblest history of a great 
people. It forms one of the finest illustrations of the 
law of causality. It embraces forces and conditions, 
both subjective and objective, working together under 
a vast variety of forms to effect great human results. 
It is, with the three exceptions of the Greek, the 
French, and the Hebrew, the longest in point of time, 
richest in content, most diverse in literary movement.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
Content 53 
It is, above all other literatures, the most ethical in 
its teachings and the most Christian in its impressive- 
ness. It lacks the aesthetic principles and forms of 
some Romantic literatures. It gives constant heed to 
the moral reason of things. 
Of all the causes creative of this literature, the most 
significant for the purpose of this volume lies in the 
content of the literature itself. Such content is far 
more important than the philological history of the 
language,—important as this is, and becoming more 
important with the successive generations of students. 
The wealth of this content is of immeasurable worth. 
The content is vitally associated with its creators. 
The amount of the wealth is hardly less impiessive 
than is the variety of its vast resources. No other 
literature offers diversities so extreme. Shakespeare, 
the universal interpreter, “the experiencing” mind, 
the man of the world, is followed by Milton, the 
moralist in prose, the theologian in verse, the Puritan 
pamphleteer striking at the evils of his own age, the 
poet whose name is linked with that of Virgil and of 
Dante. Addison, the union of morality, of religion, 
of literature, and of eloquence, follows Milton, being 
at once grave and humorous, elevated and common- 
place, whose writing beats in harmonious music and 
is woven of the strand of noble conduct. He, in turn, 
is succeeded by Swift, both vulgar and gifted, witty 
and brusque, unhappy, scornful, proud, impatient,
-P-A-G-E-66
    54 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
sceptical, energetic, hated and hating, but of a power 
which puts him with the immortals. In the fast- 
coming generations Wordsworth appears, writing 
verses of highest inspiration and also lines of common 
doggerel, the philosopher and the ethical interpreter 
in poetry. Shelley and Keats emerge as singers of 
romance, and Tennyson as the recorder of the Middle 
Age chivalry and mystery, and chanting, like the 
Greek tragedians, to the despairing heart of man. 
Browning comes forth as the virile optimist in the 
prose song, the shadow of a great rock in a weary 
land, and a wall of defence for the morally tempted. 
The novelists, too, in the later decades become regnant. 
Walter Scott, the bringer-back of the later chivalry; 
Dickens, the painter of the common life of the common 
people, and Thackeray, the interpreter of the common 
life of a higher human zone; Newman, the mystic, 
the unsurpassed master of a limpid style, the singer 
of prose music; Macaulay, the orator in history and 
essay, as well as in the House of Commons, martial, 
majestic, the incarnation of English political liberal- 
ism; John Stuart Mill, metaphysician, economist, 
logician, rationalist, an intellect devoted to highest 
purposes; Carlyle, a John the Baptist, proclaiming 
his own coming indeed, a combination of great-mind- 
edness and of shattered nerves, to whom notions had 
the value of inductions, a poet without rhyme—and
-P-A-G-E-67
  Content 55 
sometimes without reason—yet a voice far-reaching 
in its shrill cries, an interpreter whose lessons are 
to abide, an inspiring and affirming force: these and 
more also are the types, constant or sporadic, of 
literature and of its creators which England offers 
the student seeking the best education for himself. 
Time and space would fail one to tell of Bacon, the 
philosopher of nature; of Edmund Burke, the phi- 
_losopher in statesmanship; of Defoe, of Richardson, 
of Fielding, of Goldsmith, of Jane Austen, of Samuel 
Johnson, and of the later essayists and poets and his- 
torians who have wrought well, coming out of a long 
and rich and diverse past, to us of the present age. 
Their work, great as it is, cannot be made perfect 
except as we, their children in the succeeding genera- 
tions of men, are responsive to their inspirations, 
becoming eager learners of the lessons they set, and 
handing over to our followers their treasures made yet 
more precious by our appreciation, affection, and 
enriching.

however different, as that possessed by language and

power of writing and interpretation of that wealth, 
has well expressed the aim of historical study in say-

Lord Acton also indicated in his inaugural address, 
as Professor at Cambridge, another lesson of history. 
He says: “It is the office of historical science to main- 
tain morality as the sole impartial criterion of men 
and things.’”? 
For history has passed over from consisting of 
Oxford chronological tables to being an interpretation 
of human motives, of human forces, of human limita- 
tions, conditions, failures and victories. It represents 
logic as well as fact, a study of the application of the 
law of causality in relations, broadest, deepest, high- 
est. No subject in the whole curriculum has more

Section 5 
The Newer Humanities 
Other human subjects, not remote from history, 
belong to our survey of the best content of an edu- 
cation which has the most worth. They are govern- 
ment, sociology, ethics, and economics. These subjects 
might be called, comprehensively, the new or the 
newer humanities. They each concern man in these 
fundamental relations which their names indicate. 
The study of them has at least two attributes, knowl- 
edge and participation. One should know the gov- 
ernment of his own country at least. One should 
know it not only for the value of the knowledge, but 
also for the sake of a more efficient participation in 
its administration. One should know the people of 
whom he is a part, under whatever name the knowl- 
edge may assume, be it either sociology or other, but 
he should also through this knowledge become a more 
worthy member of the community. One should know 
the philosophy or science of ethics, not only because 
the knowledge is important, but also because h> 
thus becomes a man of ideals higher, of character 
richer, of conduct more worthy. One should know 
economics or political economy, called by John Stuart

Mill a “form of social philosophy,” not only because 
such an understanding is of primary value, but also 
because he is more amply equipped to take his part 
in the carrying forward of the business committed to 
himself. 
If government, sociology, ethics, and economics 
form the newer humanities, another subject of chief 
and comprehensive worth is the oldest humanity, phi- 
losophy. With philosophy, in modern use, are united 
psychology and logic. Philosophy has many defi- 
nitions, as has also psychology. Philosophy, in its 
broadest relations, may be named the science of first 
principles. It represents the methods and conditions 
and forees which underlie every form of man’s think- 
ing. It is the master and regulator of all subjects of 
learning. It is the norm of directive power. But, in 
a narrower sense, it is a theory of knowledge. “Psy- 
chology is,” as James says, “the Science of Mental 
Life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions. 
The phenomena are such things as we call feelings, de- 
sires, cognitions, reasonings, decisions, and the like.’ 
Logic, in turn, that Cinderella of the philosophic 
family,—a place which she should not occupy,—is con- 
cerned with the method of the mind’s reasoning. It 
is a picture of the way the mind works when it works 
at all. It is a subject which should be made the prince

in the philosophical faculty, if philosophy itself be 
crowned, as it ought to be, king. 
As philosophy represents principles which underlie 
and support every educational subject, so another 
study stands for a likewise broad interpretation and 
application of the themes of knowledge. This is the 
subject of the fine arts. Technically, as I have already 
pointed out, the fine arts include painting, sculpture, 
architecture, music, and poetry. The fine arts have 
for their primary purpose the giving of pleasure to 
the auditor or to the spectator. But, under this broad 
conception, or aim, every subject might be included 
as a fine art. For, every subject of study is designed, 
or may be designed, to give pleasure. The student of 
mathematics finds pleasure in his contemplations; the 
student of logic, satisfactions in his reasoning; the 
student of chemistry and of physics, happiness in his 
observations and inferences. In their broader, as well 
as in their narrower, concepts, the fine arts should be 
made to belong to every science and to every appli- 
cation of science. Their pleasant qualities should be 
more frequently manifested and more strongly and 
constantly grasped by the perceiving mind. 
So far I have written of the human sciences as 
standing for the content of that education which is of 
the highest worth. I now turn to the consideration 
of the value of the natural and physical sciences.

Section 6 
The Sciences 
On the 10th of January, 1859, at the age of thirty- 
nine, Mr. Herbert Spencer wrote to his home, saying: 
“T have agreed with Chapman to do an article for 
him on the relative values of different kinds of knowl- 
edge. I have not fixed the title yet. But its chief aim 
is to go in for more science.’ 
Out of this purpose of Mr. Spencer sprang the first 
chapter of his historic essay, “What Education is of 
Most Worth.” In the sixty and more years that have 
passed since Mr. Spencer went “in for more science,” 
science and the sciences have continued in enlarging 
breadth and in increasing power. To name the changes 
wrought in these sciences themselves and by these 
sciences in three-score years would be as unbecoming 
in me as it is unnecessary. They, these sciences, have 
made new conquests in old worlds. New worlds them- 
selves, they have discovered other new worlds in both 
the infinitesimally small and in the infinitely great. 
They have made hypotheses which have proved fertile 
and fruitful. They have won victories from defeats, 
and they give promise of winning further victories at 
present beyond human ken. These enlarged knowl- 
edges relate to the utilization of nature’s forces, in 
provinces as remote and unlike as the growth of new 
*“An Autobiography,” by Herbert Spencer, Vol. II, p. 38.

Content 61 
plants and the discovery of new planets. These knowl- 
edges, taken together, cover what may be called ex- 
changes, exchanges, full and swift, of ideas, of goods, 
and of persons. These exchanges represent such tre- 
mendous forces and movements as are found in the 
wireless transmission of messages, and in the radio 
activities, over land, under water, and through the 
air. Within the short life of a single individual these 
and other like results represent forces making for 
man’s physical wellbeing, richer and more ample 
than the twenty preceding centuries had been able 
to achieve. 
Yet there is one science which has special velit 
ships to the education of most worth, namely, the 
science of biology, and the science of biology as ap- 
plied in particular to human beings. For, the ultimate 
purpose is the improvement and even perfection of 
the human race. The gaining of that purpose is a 
process of apparently endless duration, of infinite 
pains and of unmeasured struggle. That process 
should, and does, have its origin in the creation, and 
proceeds to the betterment of the individual created. 
It begins with the beginning of life. Beginnings help 
to determine ends. Therefore, the very hour of the 
commencement of life and every following hour and 
year of nurture should represent wisdom the wisest, 
and devotion the most loyal to the truth of biological 
science. Therefore, in determining the content of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-74

education of most worth, the highest place is to be 
given to the science of human biology. Whatever 
name the subject may bear in its theoretical aspect, 
of physiology, or bio-chemistry, or in its applied re- 
lationship of hygiene, it is to be ranked as of com- 
manding value. 
It is, however, to be acknowledged that the results 
of applied science spring, in no small degree, from 
pure science. To the man of science, working for 
ends wholly scientific, the world owes its greatest dis- 
coveries of nature’s secrets. From these discoveries 
have been derived the inventions or applications or 
adjustments of the powers of nature which make for 
human happiness, comfort, and welfare.® 
* Professor H. W. Mountcastle, of Western Reserve Uni- 
versity, gives me a list of certain applications of pure science 
which have resulted in important goods. 
“(1) Galvani’s Experiment (1786) with the frog’s legs, laid 
the foundation for the production of continuous currents of 
electricity, and thus paved the way for all of the greatest dis- 
coveries in electricity, many of which have found one or more 
applications for the benefit of mankind. 
“(2) Seebeck’s discovery of thermo electricity (1821) has 
given us a valuable and accurate thermometer for the measure- 
ment of temperatures where ordinary mercury-in-glass ther- 
mometers would be of no avail. 
“(3) Arago’s Experiment, of rotating metal disk and mag- 
netic needle (1824), for many years was of interest only to 
scientists as an illustration of the production of Foucault cur- 
rents in accordance with Lenz’s Law of induced currents. 
Today, one of the successful automobile speedometers is based 
upon this experiment, and some of our most satisfactory elec-

Writing 
A subject which unites certain qualities of the phy- 
sical and the human sciences is what I shall call 
writing. Writing is a subject or method which repre- 
sents the best results for the individual and for the 
community. Near the close of his life, Jowett, Master 
of Balliol, wrote to Margaret Tennant (Mrs. Asquith) , 
saying: “The best education for the whole of life is 
writing.” The remark is significant. It may be 
tric motors operate on a principle closely related to that 
exemplified in the Arago Experiment. 
“(4) Michael Faraday’s discovery of electro-magnetic induc- 
tion in 1831 has given the world a number of devices, such as 
the electric motor, the electric generator, the alternating cur- 
rent transformer, and the modern telephone. 
“(5) The study of the conduction of electricity through 
gases has produced the three electrode vacuum tube without 
which modern wireless telegraphy and transcontinental tele- 
phony would be impossible. 
“(6) From the study of the modes of transference of heat, 
Dewar was léd to the invention of the thermos bottle. 
“(7) The laws of thermal expansion have produced such 
useful things as the compensated balance wheel of the watch, 
the compensated pendulum of the clock, and one kind of fire 
alarm. 
“(§) Newton’s Law of Gravitation was applied, in a roman- 
tic way, to the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846. 
“(9) Hooke’s Law, ‘Ut tensio, sic vis,’ first given in the form 
of an anagram, is fundamental in the field of structural engi- 
neering.”

and Lewis Campbell, Vol. II, p. 454.

  64 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
applied in a narrow field. For writing represents a 
technical form of education. It may also be applied 
in a broad sense. For writing represents the whole 
creative act. It stands for both form and content. It 
is putting words together to express ideas. It is 
making something new. It is one of the most im- 
portant of all the creative acts of the young mind. 
It is also the most important of the creative acts of 
the mature mind. It represents thinking, hard think- 
ing, as thinking is a process harder than the act of 
learning. It calls out intellectual concentration. Both 
the preliminary and the subsequent thinking and the 
writing itself demand a certain logical system. The 
processes represent beginning and ending, proportion 
and unity. They stand for fullness of understanding, 
accuracy in the use of words, clearness in meaning, 
forcefulness, and, if it be possible, they also should, 
as Herbert Spencer points out, promote mental econ- 
omy on the part of the reader. In turn, too, writing 
and thinking should lead to reading and to research, 
as, indeed, reading and research lead to thinking and 
writing. Each set of qualities is at once cause and 
result. 
Writing, as a content or form of education, is ever 
to be accompanied by at least three qualities or forces. 
One quality is criticism, criticism by one’s self and 
criticism also by the proper judge. This criticism is 
to be sympathetic and quickening. Certain critics are

Content 65 
as gall to the writer. Some critics at times, like the 
late Professor Francis J. Child (of a very kind heart, 
however), are so severe as to cut the nerve of the 
essayist. “Fool,” a name he applied to certain men 
in his criticism of their essays, was not encouraging to 
either the commonplace or the brilliant Junior. Criti- 
cism is to enter into details, as well as to relate to the 
atmospheres and moods, of the essay. It is also ever 
to be accompanied by illuminating examples. Dickens 
says that any literary criticism is not worth a farthing 
without innumerable examples. The writing is not 
only to be sympathetically criticized and in detail, 
but writing is also to be constantly pursued. Practice 
is as necessary for securing the best results in writing 
as in playing the piano. Writing is an art, moreover, 
as well as a science, and it is an art which, in part, is 
learned by writing. We learn to do by doing, to 
walk by walking, to write by writing. It is, however, 
as Galsworthy says, a “woundy business, long to learn, 
hard to learn, and no gift of the angels.’ 
It is also to be borne in mind that great wisdom is 
needed in the selection of the kind of writing which is 
fitted to give the richest intellectual and ethical re- 
muneration. The problem is an individual one. One 
has not the genius of Rousseau or of Stevenson in 
creating different kinds of writing, but one may have 
more than the wisdom of either in selecting the kind 
* Foreword to Hudson’s “Green Mansions,” p. X. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
    
66 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
which one is best fitted to do. For most, the plain 
prose of the plain essay promises the richest results. 
The writing of letters is the condition readiest at hand. 
Even if one cannot write letters like Voltaire’s, a 
prince of the art, one can try to make this form of 
writing a not unworthy bit of literature. 
What has been said about the value of written com- 
position as a part of the best education, applies in 
many respects to what may be called oral composition 
or speaking. Education through speaking is at once 
more easy and more difficult than education through 
writing. It is more easy, for speaking is a constant 
act. It is more difficult, for, in the frequency of speak- 
ing and in the infrequency of writing, speaking has a 
less novel and less formative power. Oral composi- 
tion, too, labors under the difficulty of promoting 
bombastic utterance. Its forensic quality is empha- 
sized at the expense of the descriptive and interpre- 
tative. It represents, furthermore, succession in time, 
while writing represents coexistence in space. It is, 
therefore, less easily subject to considerate criticism. 
But oral composition, as a form of worthy education, 
has the same advantages and is subject to like rules 
of criticism as written composition. But as a form of 
education, it calls up the remark of President Walker 
of Harvard, to the effect that the aim of education is 
the creation of the ability to tell what one knows. 
Yet he was accustomed to add that some men were
-P-A-G-E-79
  
Content 67 
so well educated that they could tell more than they 
knew! It also recalls the remark of Thomas Went- 
worth Higginson: “Why should we all (save Emerson) 
be so impatient to speak? Why not wait till next 
moment or next sphere, if necessary, and say it de- 
liberately and well? But no, the terrible throb of 
eager desire for utterance drives men on, like hunger 
or lust, with no power to calculate or resist.’ 
Both writing and speaking represent and embody 
the highest content and stages of education. For 
they both stand for ideas, for logical thinking, for just 
and sound interpretations, and for truthfulness in fact 
and in inference. 
Section 8 
Religion 
A subject which, as I have intimated, is neither a 
newer humanity nor a natural science, which repre- 
sents the forces of the highest worth in education, is 
religion. Religion is at once a science and an art, a 
faith and a knowledge. When contrasted with the- 
ology, it is rather an art than a science, rather a belief 
than a form of logic. The science of religion may 
properly be called theology. Of religion, the special 
organ is the church. As both an art and a science, it 
°“Letters and Journals of Thomas Wentworth Higginson,” 
edited by Mary Thacher Higginson, p. 348.  
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
belongs to the individual, as well as to the community. 
For the teaching of religion, both to the individual 
and to the community, three forces are available, the 
family, the church, the school. The family represents 
the original, the historic method. The father was the 
domestic priest and the religious rites were performed 
by him at the family altar. To-day, it is at once to 
be said that the head of the family is not usually fitted 
to perform this supreme rite or to do this highest duty. 
The second method is the church. The church is at 
the present time the proper agent for such teaching. 
The Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran are 
logically sound in the establishment and maintenance 
of their parochial schools. Practically, and for large 
human interests, they are wrong. For the child rep- 
resents instruction, training, nurture other than re- 
ligious. The third method is embodied in the public 
school itself. This method represents the bare form 
of religious instruction which is given by the church, 
Roman Catholic and Lutheran. In the present sep- 
aration, however, between the state and the church, 
religious instruction in the public school is impossible, 
or, at least under the controlling conditions, imprac- 
ticable. But the church, in co-operation with the pub- 
lic school, may be able to give instruction in the 
special type of religion which it does represent. Such 
a method is, however, difficult of application. It rep- 
resents the minister of the individual church coming
-P-A-G-E-81
  Content 69 
to the schoolhouse to give religious teachings; or it 
represents the pupils of the school going to the indi- 
vidual church to receive religious teaching. The taking 
over of the children of a school into the care of the 
church for religious instruction for certain hours of 
each week is the more normal of these two systems. 
This method has brought forth good results in New 
South Wales. With a sincere desire on the part of 
the: public school authorities to cause the co-operative 
movement to succeed, its value is assured. Without 
such desire, the endeavor falls fruitless. 
Education in religion is of the utmost importance. 
It is not to be made the object of either suspicion or 
of ridicule. The normal man is not an atheist. The 
normal man believes in God, at least in a god which 
may be spelled with a small g. He believes in a power 
above himself, which may be either personal or im- 
personal. But it is a power in which he lives and 
moves and has his being. Religion belongs to man as 
man, and, therefore, belongs to the child as child. 
Properly interpreted and applied, it is the most for- 
mative of all educational forces. It helps to determine 
destiny.*° 
*The Bible is the sacred book of the Christian faith. Its 
reading in the public schools of the different States represents 
a long and, at times, a heated discussion. At the present 
time, “six States require that a portion of the Bible be read 
daily in their schools; six other States specifically permit by 
law the reading of the Bible in the public schools; in nineteen

With science, as I have interpreted it, and with 
religion, lies man’s lot in the future. For, as Arthur 
James Balfour says: “For my own part I cannot con- 
ceive numan society permanently deprived of the re- 
ligious element; and, on the other hand, I look to 
science far more than to the work of statesmen or to 
the creation of constitutions, or to the elaboration of 
social systems, or to the study of sociology. I look to 
science more than anything else as the great amelio- 
rator of the human lot in the future. If I had to 
believe that those two great powers were, indeed, in 
  
States and the District of Columbia the law is silent on the 
subject, and under general terms of the law Bible reading is 
construed as permissible; in five States, whose laws otherwise 
contain no specific provision on the subject, the courts have 
rendered opinions favorable to Bible reading. In Michigan 
and California the matter is at present somewhat in doubt. 
The Michigan Supreme Court held, in a particular case before 
it, that the reading of Bible stories emphasizing ‘moral pre- 
cepts’ was not unconstitutional, if the reader made no comment 
and pupils were permitted to absent themselves, but the court 
went no further in some other aspects of the matter. A case 
involving Bible reading in the schools is at present pending in 
the Supreme Court of California. Massachusetts has both a 
statute requiring Bible reading and a favorable court decision. 
“There remain ten States, and in these it is not permissible 
to read the Bible at stated times in the public schools. Of 
these States three have supreme court decisions adverse to 
such reading, and in the remaining seven an opinion of the 
State superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, 
or other authoritative construction has barred the Bible from 
the schools.” (“The Bible in the Public Schools, Legal Status 
and Current Practice,” by William R. Hood, Bureau of Edu- 
cation Bulletin, 1923, No. 15, p. 2.)

immutable and perpetual antagonism, it would be im- 
possible for me to avoid that hopeless despair which 
makes effort impossible, which deprives labour of all 
its fruit for the future, whether we live to see it, or 
not, which makes the travail and struggle of mankind 
for the happy and better conditions of society utterly 
beyond any reasonable expectations that we could 
form; and I at least should hardly think it worth while 
to spend effort to waste time in doing that which I 
know would be a fruitless task—namely, to make a 
race such as we are, men such as ourselves, the fore- 
fathers of future generations who are to attempt the 
impossible task of either abandoning all religious out- 
look upon the world or of rejecting all ministrations 
of that science which, more and more I am driven to 
believe, is the greatest mundane agent for good.” 
The contents of the several subjects which I have 
outlined are used in giving an education of the utmost 
worth. Their number is large, the knowledge repre- 
sented in each great. The extent to which each sub- 
ject should be used arises from several, and diverse, 
conditions. The value of each to the receiving student 
depends upon his ability, and especially upon his re- 
sponsiveness. He is unable, in the few and brief years 
of his educational course, to give himself to each and 
to all. The elective system, therefore, is to be pur-

Balfour,” by Wilfrid M. Short, pp. 370-3871.

sued. The proportion of time and strength to be 
allowed each subject is a problem of the individual 
and is by him to be solved in all available wisdom. 
In such selection, however, it is plain that a common 
denominator of subjects should not be neglected. For 
most boys and girls in the earlier stages of their edu- 
cation, that content or method which is of highest 
value is not a highly specialized education. A certain 
general knowledge of the human and of the natural 
sciences is to be commended and commanded. The 
human sciences are to be known for their content, and 
the natural for their method. It is, however, at once 
to be added that the chief worth of the worthiest edu- 
cation lies not in the knowledge which it may or does 
afford, but in the increase of intellectual power, which 
results from the knowing. Not the library, despite its 
accumulative value, but the dynamo is the more fitting 
type of the worth of education. 
For, after all, who are the uneducated? The unedu- 
cated, as a class, are not so much those who cannot 
read or write as they are those who cannot reason, not 
so much those who do not know as those who cannot 
think. The class is composed of those who draw uni- 
versal laws from narrow observation. They make a 
single and simple example an occasion for believing 
that they know and understand all. They let personal 
feeling, their regard or their hate, determine ver- 
dicts which should be based on evidence, built up of
-P-A-G-E-85
Content 73 
reasoned judgments. They let hear-say take the place 
of fact, and make exclamations a substitute for logic. 
They lack a sense of intellectual values, giving to an 
anecdote the worth of an authentic general truth, and 
to the metaphor the convincingness of an argument. 
Motives for conduct or for a single act are assigned 
without proper evidence. Principles, or lack of prin- 
ciples, are attributed to individualities without full 
reason. Historic characters are assailed with the 
verbal alacrity of an auctioneer. Keen wit, brilliancy 
of repartee, the force of affirmation, is made a sub- 
stitute for soundness of intellectual justice. They— 
the uneducated—eulogize the value of commonsense 
as the result of experience, and depreciate the training 
of the schools with which, they rejoice to say, they 
were never afflicted. The uneducated usually move in 
an atmosphere of personal pride or vanity, having 
manners quite as bombastic as those of Dr. Johnson 
without his power, manners which seem to be based 
equally on a belief in one’s own intellectual integrity 
and on a semi-contemptuousness of the honor or 
honesty of the liberally educated. 
Such are some of the characteristics of the unedu- 
cated. To transfer this class into the class of the 
educated is the great problem of the school and of 
the college. It is indeed a long, an age-long, problem. 
It belongs in a general sense to the development of 
humanity of one generation. It belongs also to the
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
development of all generations from the first origins 
to the complete and final consummations. It also 
belongs in a peculiar way to the youth of each genera- 
tion. This problem or endeavor begins with learning, 
and with learning it continues. The learning never 
ceases. Yet the learning may become less, and, at all 
events, presently thinking begins. Thinking continues. 
and, what is more, thinking increases, develops, grows. 
As the importance and the place of learning lessen, 
the importance and place of thinking increase, and as 
the importance and place of thinking increase, learning 
becomes less important. The decrease and the in- 
crease go along together. Learning without thinking 
is an accumulation, blind, meaningless, ineffective. 
Thinking without learning is empty and void, also 
comparatively useless. Both together, put into a 
world with emotion and will and conscience in the 
individual or the community, are and represent the 
controlling forces in civilization. “Look and think,” 
as Asa Gray used to tell his students; and one may 
also say, think and look. 
It is, therefore, of primary significance to make the 
first years of school life, times of learning. Let the 
mind clutch and cram. The mind is a stomach: fill it. 
The mind is a granary: store it to the roof. The mind 
is a ship: load it to the water’s edge. Multiplication 
tables are its grain, its wheat. French verbs, Latin 
declensions, Greek conjugations, are its food. Geo-
-P-A-G-E-87
  Content 75 
graphic facts, historical dates are its cargo. Of course, 
however, the cramming is not to be undue filling. The 
loading of the ship is not to be over-loading. 
Learning is the library of fact, judgment, opinion, 
lodged in the printed volume or in manuscript. Think- 
ing is the pointing out of the relation of these facts, 
the interpretations of these judgments, the vitalizing 
of these lifeless pages. Learning is the vast ocean of 
knowledge into which all the streams of history, of 
humanity’s achievements and affairs, pour themselves, 
noble, impressive. Thinking is the use of this limit- 
less accumulation for the enlargement of human char- 
acter, for the betterment of the nations, for the enrich- 
ment of the individual and of the race. Learning is 
the chart-room of the ocean steamship, its walls hung 
with maps and diagrams of winds and of currents, of 
deep water and shoal, its desks covered with mathe- 
matical books and logarithmic tables and instruments 
necessary to safe and swift navigation. Thinking is 
the ship’s officer who uses these tables and charts and 
chronometers for the determination of latitude and 
longitude, and for the securing of the great and final 
purpose of the voyage. 4

The problem for the school in making learners and 
thinkers lies in securing teachers who can, through the 
codperation of these students, not only make scholars, 
but also thinkers. Difficult it is to secure a proper 
number of proper teachers to give proper lessons. It 
is vastly more difficult and vastly more important to 
get teachers who are inspirers, dynamic powers and 
vitalizing forces, to create the mood of reflection and 
of considerateness in the mind of youth. Such teach- 
ers we do have. But apparently humanity does not 
create a number sufficient to meet the recurring and 
increasing demands. Indeed, in every intellectual 
calling the demand for leaders, as I have already 
pointed out, exceeds the supply of leaders. 
The problem of the school in securing those who 
can inspire thinking and thoughtfulness is also the 
problem of business. The limitations do not apply 
to the school room alone. They belong to the count- 
ing room and the factory.

I once asked Mr. S. T. Wellman, one of the three 
men of his time who knew the most about making that 
symbol of modern civilization, a piece of steel, what 
he found to be the great lack in his workmen. Imme- 
diately was his reply, “The power to think.” A similar 
question I asked of another representative of great 
interests. With a toss of his own head, he answered, 
“Brains!” The two masters in industry, Mr. John D. 
Rockefeller and Mr. Andrew Carnegie, we think of as 
men of tremendous will. They are such men. But, 
greater than their power of will is their power of 
thinking. 
What is it to think? It is to reason, to judge, to 
compare, to contrast, to reflect, to consider, to put 
fact with fact, to add truth to truth, and to infer a 
new fact and a new truth. It is to see things in respect 
to each other. It is to answer aright the big question, 
Why? To think well is to consider with attentiveness, 
to reflect with thoroughness, to see with clearness, to 
compare with fairness, to judge in cubical relations. 
The chief part of the problem, however, is not a 
definition of the nature of thinking, but it is to seek 
to answer the immediate question, what is the best 
method of making thinkers through the schools and 
the colleges? How can one be taught to think? To 
this I wish, and briefly, to give three answers. The 
first is, one may learn to think by thinking. Appren- 
ticeship applies in the intellectual realm quite as much  
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
as in the executive or practical. A passage in a letter 
of Cotton Mather to his son illustrates the practical 
method. The great man writes, in speaking of his 
life at Harvard College, a college to which he went 
at the age of twelve: 
“T compared systems both of logick and of physick 
in catechisms of my own which have been since used 
by many others. I went over the uses of globes and 
proceeded in arithmetic as far as was ordinary. I 
made theses and antitheses upon the main questions 
that lay before me. . . . Hundreds of books I read 
over and I kept a diary of my studies.’* 
Mather’s comparing systems in logic and physics, his 
catechisms, his theses and antitheses, his diary, repre- 
sent methods and forces of thinking. Many, too many, 
to-day just learn rules of logic or principles of physics, 
and just read books (not hundreds, usually), without 
catechizing themselves. They are absorbers and not 
reasoners, sponges and not forces. Learn to think by 
thinking. Little thinking is still thinking. The little 
thinking passes over into much, and the much into 
more, and the more grows from more to more. 
A second method of becoming a thinker lies along 
the road of learning. Learning should be the way 
leading to the house of thinking. The guideposts of 
knowledge point the way to the house of reflection. 
If one learn any subject with attentiveness, with

thoroughness, with carefulness, with clearness, with 
honesty, with a sense of relation, it will be found that 
these qualities, the attentiveness, thoroughness, care- 
fulness, clearness, honesty, the sense of relationship, 
become principles and elements of his own intellectual 
constitution, laws of his mental procedure. In time, 
the content of the learning, as I have intimated, may 
become less. The years diminish the body of knowl- 
edge. Forgetfulness throws out the half-remembered 
fact. But the intellectual qualities which were exer- 
cised in the gaining of this content of learning, the 
intellectual qualities which were exercised in securing 
this body of knowledge, have unconsciously and essen- 
tially become a part of one’s intellectual treasures. 
One has made one’s self a thinker, through careful, 
clear, honest, comprehensive learning and knowing. 
To illustrate, I have quite forgotten my calculus, 
studied as a Sophomore. I cannot read Greek as well 
as I could at the close of my Junior year. But the 
clearness of apprehension and of the understanding 
of the higher mathematical forces, the appreciation of 
beauty and the sense of relationships found in lan- 
guages form still my dearest intellectual treasures. 
There is a further method to which I wish to allude. 
It is the method of making thinkers by personal con- 
tact and relation. It is the method lying in the young 
and immature mind coming into close fellowship, or 
collision even, with the mind that is mature. Such 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
a method stirs and moves the stagnant intellectual 
waters into swift currents. The method is far less 
common than ought to, or may, prevail. The reason 
for the lack lies in the absence of the quickening spirit. 
The need still exists that the spirit of some God shall 
move upon the face of the waters; and the spirit is not 
easily created. Thinking, thoughtful teachers make 
thinking students and thoughtful scholars. As John 
Stuart Mill says, in a letter written in the year 1867, 
“Real education depends on the contact of human 
living soul with human living soul.’”” 
Following such general or liberal education lies edu- 
cation special, professional, vocational. The general 
education is designed to develop personality through 
certain fundamental studies. The special, professional, 
vocational is designed to develop practitioners through 
specialized studies. The first may be said to teach 
students, the second to teach studies. Modern life 
has become a collection of highly specialized human 
forces. Education should train men to possess these 
forces amply and to use these forces wisely and effec- 
tively. The three so-called learned professions of the 
earlier time have, within two generations, received 
additions in engineering, including architecture, in 
journalism, and in teaching. These six callings, and 
others, too, possess the characteristics of a profession, 
namely special preparation, a body of literature, a 
* Letters, Vol. II, p. 86.
-P-A-G-E-93
  
Forces 81 
body of adherents, and a non-commercial or a human 
purpose. But, behind and before the special prep- 
aration for these vocations lies a general education 
itself. For professional education possesses relation- 
ships which are to be understood and appreciated. 
These relationships can be most clearly understood 
and most fully appreciated through a general edu- 
cation completed before beginning professional studies. 
A general intellectual power is also best created and 
disciplined by general subjects. Behind the profes- 
sional study of law and of its practice lie history, 
psychology, economics, government. Behind this pro- 
fessional study lie the creative forces of the disciplined 
power of thinking. Behind the professional study of 
medicine and its practice lie the three great sciences 
of physics, chemistry, and biology, as well as other 
subjects less directly preparatory. Behind the pro- 
fessional study for the ministry or the priesthood lie 
philosophy, sociology, language, and literature. Behind 
the professional study of engineering or its practice in 
each of its several branches lie, or should lie, the great 
human subjects. Behind the technical studies for 
teaching or for journalism should be found a great 
body of general subjects, none of which would prove 
valueless in the pursuit of these great vocations. There 
is truth in the remark that the most remunerative 
college studies for one’s whole life, as well as for a 
professional career, are those which have no direct or
-P-A-G-E-94
    
82 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
immediate relation to that career itself. There is 
truth in the saying that the most useful studies are 
those which are useless. Such remarks, however, are 
to be interpreted and weighed, and not accepted at 
their face value as current coin of the intellectual 
realm. 
That great Master of English public-school edu- 
cation, Thring of Uppingham, wrote forty years ago, 
saying: 
“As far as possible we do not take into consideration 
professional life and special training for special call- 
ings. We consider that a literary education, as it con- 
tains the best thoughts of the best thinkers in the best 
shape, is the most perfect training for man the thinker, 
whatever he may be obliged to do later in life. 
“Tf I wanted to train a soldier, I should not take a 
child and drill him every day and put him through 
the regimental movements; I should teach him to race, 
to climb, to swim, to be a gymnast, to play games, to 
make his body as strong, as active, as enduring as 
possible. It will be quite time enough to narrow this, 
and teach him the goose step, when he enlists. So 
also with the mind. If our literary and classical edu- 
cation is true, as I think it is, then it makes the mind 
strong and ready, and does not dwarf or shrivel it 
up. 3,

Principal Story of Glasgow, from the university 
side, confirms the judgment of the great Thring: 
“There are two things which the University can 
bestow, which are separate, but yet can be received 
and held together. The one is, in the comprehensive 
sense, culture; for the good of the student’s mental 
and moral development and character as a whole; the 
other is knowledge as applied to the special life-work 
he has chosen. He benefits most by his University 
training who receives and lays firm hold on both; but 
in a University it should always be a recognized prin- 
ciple, that the broad basis of culture should underlie 
all specialism and mastery of applied science. The 
Univrsity is more and greater than a technical school. 
There is a tendency in some minds to regard a scien- 
tific or a commercial education as in some sort a rival 
to the ‘Humanities’—to an education in letters, classics 
and philosophy. But there should be no real antago- 
nism between the two, if it is remembered that a man 
is more than a specialist, be his speciality what you 
will—medicirie, law, or commerce, engineering or elec- 
tricity, or any mechanical or material art.’* 
It is also to be added that the professional studies 
should be so pursued that the richest, deepest, broad- 
est, highest results may not be lacking. Intellectual 
sympathy, as well as professional efficiency, altruism

as well as forceful personality, appreciation as well as 
assimilation, should be nurtured. It should not be 
forgotten that the leaders of the American bar, like 
the Choates, or of medicine, like Osler, or of the pulpit, 
like Brooks, are great and rich human personalities. 
In securing such results in and through professional 
teaching, the culture of the teacher himself giving the 
formal instruction is a chief asset. For between the 
content of education and its method stands a force 
partaking of both, and in certain senses more precious 
than either,—the teacher. 
In securing and giving education which is of the 
most worth, general or special, the teacher is the 
element or force which is of chief value. Illustrations 
abound. One of the more remarkable of such loyal- 
ties on the part both of the student and of the teacher 
is found in Jowett of Balliol. It is said of him: “His 
devotion to his pupils was, at this time, something 
unique at Oxford; and it was rendered more effective 
by the singular personal charm which made him irre- 
sistible to younger men, and the candour of his judg- 
ment, in which he always sought to take in the man 
as a whole, without regarding minor points of position, 
conduct, or opinion. More valuable than all was the 
penetrating sympathy with which he discerned the 
individual wants of his pupils and the critical points 
in their mental history, and the eager promptitude
-P-A-G-E-97
  Forces 85 
with which he came to their aid unasked in difficulties 
which his sagacity had divined.”® 
Similar testimony is given by Lord Bryce regarding 
Edward Ernest Bowen of Harrow: “His leading prin- 
ciples were two—that the boy must at all hazards be 
interested in the lessons and that he should be at ease 
with the teacher. . . . It need hardly be said that he 
loved boys as he loved teaching. He took them with 
him in the holidays on walking tours. He kept up 
correspondence with many of his pupils after they 
left Harrow, and advised them as occasion rose. To 
many of them he remained through life the model 
whom they desired to imitate. But he was very chary 
of the exercise of influence. ‘A boy’s character,’ he 
once wrote, ‘grows like the Temple of old, without. 
sound of mallet and trowel. What we can do is to 
arrange matters so as to give Virtue her best chance. 
We can make the right choice sometimes a little easier, 
we can prevent tendencies from blossoming into acts, 
and render pitfalls visible. How much indirectly and 
unconsciously we can do, none but the recording angel 
knows.’ ‘You can and you should,’ said Chiffers, ‘go 
straight to the heart of every individual boy.’ Well, 
a fellow-creature’s mind is a sacred thing. You may 
enter into that arcanum once a year, shoeless. And 
in the effort to control the spirit of a pupil, to make

one’s own approval his test and mould him by the 
stress of our own presence, in the ambition to do this, 
the craving for moral power and visible guiding, the 
subtle pride of effective agency, lie some of the chief 
temptations of a schoolmaster’s work.’ ””* 
The influence of teacher over student is illustrated 
in the life of Charles Darwin quite as strongly as in 
the lives of the classicists. Darwin’s friendship with 
Professor Henslow at Cambridge was perhaps the most 
important factor in influencing his career. Professor 
Henslow kept open house at least once every week, 
when under-graduates and some of the other members 
of the University used to meet. Darwin became well 
acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter part 
of his course took long walks with him on summer 
days. Darwin says that his knowledge of botany, 
entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology was 
great, and that he was accustomed to draw conclusions 
from long continued minute observation. It was Hens- 
low who persuaded Darwin to begin the study of 
geology. Professor Sedgwick also had a strong influ- 
ence over him.? 
Into the undergraduate life of that great and unique 
character, John Henry Newman, two men entered with 
unique power. They were Hawkins, the Provost of

Oriel and the Vicar of St. Mary’s, and Richard 
Whately. Of Hawkins, Newman says: 
“He was the first who taught me to weigh my words, 
and to be cautious in my statements. He led me to 
that mode of limiting and clearing my sense in dis- 
cussion and in controversy, and of distinguishing be- 
tween cognate ideas, and of obviating mistakes by 
anticipation, which to my surprise has been since con- 
sidered, even in quarters friendly to me, to savour of 
the polemics of Rome. He is a man of most exact 
mind himself, and he used to snub me severely, on 
reading, as he was kind enough to do, the first Sermons 
that I wrote, and other compositions which I was 
engaged upon.”® 
Of him, who was afterwards known as Archbishop 
Whately, Newman writes: 
“T owe him a great deal. He was a man of generous 
and warm heart. He was particularly loyal to his 
friends, and to use the common phrase, ‘all his geese 
were swans.’ While I was still awkward and timid in 
1822, he took me by the hand, and acted the part to 
me of a gentle and encouraging instructor. He, em- 
phatically, opened my mind, and taught me to think 
and to use my reason.’”®

—one of the ablest of college executives,—says of his 
college life: 
“The most profitable portion of my college life was 
its last year, under the instruction of President Way- 
land. He was then in the ripe fulness of his powers. 
His specialty as a teacher was moral science, though he 
also taught political economy. But the latter inter- 
ested him only theorctically; the former, practically 
and intensely. His strong sense of justice and his 
profound love of truth made him a most impressive 
teacher of ethics——the most impressive I have ever 
known; and his keen sense of humor, his quick wit, 
his appreciation of wit in others, always made his reci- 
tation-room a very lively place. He was no meta- 
physician; his moral science, even in its distinctively 
theoretic portions, was more practical than metaphys- 
ical, no part of it resting on any metaphysical sys- 
tem, avowed or implied. When I was his pupil, mental 
philosophy, even on its psychological side, had received 
from him only casual attention. His treatise on ‘In- 
tellectual Philosophy’ was written after I had passed 
from under him, and years after his views of moral 
science had become inflexibly fixed. Nor was he 
widely read in the science of ethics. Allusions in his 
lecture-room to authors whose views differed from his 
own were extremely rare. He had thought out his 
ethical principles for himself, and his conclusions were 
deep and strong, and rooted in the very depths of his

being. Above all men whom I ever knew, he was him- 
self the embodiment of what he taught. Clear and 
analytic in his own thinking, he insisted on analyzed 
and logical thought in his pupils. Possessed of a 
stature and a muscular development and a physiog- 
nomy that would have made him an admirable model 
for a Jupiter Tonans, and animated by a spirit that 
lifted him above everything selfish and mean, he suc- 
ceeded beyond every other college president of his 
time, I suspect, in impressing himself and his senti- 
ments on all who came under his instruction.”?” 
The greatest influence of Yale College upon the 
elder Silliman was the personality of the elder’ Presi- 
dent Dwight, who came to the college during Silli- 
man’s senior year. Up to this time he had attained 
a respectable rank in his classes, and was equally able 
in all departments of college work. But President 
Dwight’s vigorous and animated discussions in the 
lecture-room and pulpit opened to his admiring pupil 
a new world of thought. Of recitations conducted by 
him, Silliman says in his journal, in October of his 
senior year: 
“Our recitations are now becoming very interesting, 
by the useful and entertaining instruction which is 
communicated in them by the President. He is truly 
a great man, and it is very rare that so many excellent

natural and acquired endowments are to be found in 
one person. When I hear him speak, it makes me feel 
like a very insignificant being, and almost prompts 
me to despair; but I am reéncouraged when I reflect 
that he was once as ignorant as myself, and that learn- 
ing is only to be acquired by long and assiduous appli- 
cation.” 
Personal influences are the most striking in the 
character and career of Samuel F. B. Morse, and these 
influences came from three men in succession. Like 
Benjamin Silliman, he fell under the magnetic power 
of President Dwight. This great man and outstanding 
college president was an inspiration to young Morse 
in the class-room, but his influence was still greater 
through the intimate and confidential relations which 
afterwards existed between them, when Morse became 
the President’s secretary. The inspirations received 
from President Dwight prepared his mind to receive 
and utilize the impressions which he gained under the 
instruction of Professor Jeremiah Day. The study of 
electricity and physics under Day proved to be a great 
influence upon him personally, and in subsequent years 
led to applications of the principles of physics, having 
priceless worth, as the world knows. But there was a 
third man in Yale College to whom Morse was in- 
debted for the influences which led to his great in- 
vention. That man was Benjamin Silliman himself, 
* “Benjamin Silliman,” by George P. Fisher, Vol. I, p. 32. 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  Forces 91 
who long held the front rank among men of science. 
Silliman was at once his teacher and friend. Morse’s 
letters at the time speak frequently of his interest in 
chemistry and of his regard for his instruction in that 
subject.’”!? 
Principal Stearns, gf Phillips Academy, Andover, 
has well indicated the worth of the teacher in an 
interpretation which he gives of an Amherst professor 
of philosophy, Charles E. Garman. Stearns thus de- 
scribes certain experiences of his undergraduate days: 
“Nothing could equal the deep and intense inter- 
est of that group of college boys. Discussion never 
stopped with the classroom. It went on everywhere. 
Mr. Garman’s study, a mile from the campus, gathered 
within its walls every night a group of eager students, 
and the battle was continued till the late hour called 
us back to our rooms. Frequently small groups would 
slip from their fraternity houses in the early morning 
hours, and, stretched under shady trees or roaming 
the countryside, would renew the struggle to under- 
stand the great and eternal problems of human life 
and the human soul that we had come to feel were 
the most important and the only real things in the 
world... . 
“We seemed to move in a new world in which the 
ordinary interests of student life became wholly in- 
consequential. The fact that the most important ball

game of the year was scheduled for the afternoon 
would be almost forgotten; and the noon meal, if we 
were fortunate enough to find one waiting for us, fur- 
nished only a further opportunity to continue the 
discussions begun in the morning’s recitation hour. 
Several of us were members of the college ball-nine 
that spring, and IJ shall never forget the feelings akin 
to resentment with which we faced the necessity of 
missing occasional classes in order to play scheduled 
games away from home with rival college teams. 
Under the leadership and inspiration of a master- 
teacher we were dealing at first hand with the great 
facts of religion and the spiritual world, and in terms 
that had meaning to the minds of youth. And that 
experience was the most exhilarating and satisfying 
we ahd ever known.”?* 
In the complexity of the forces which the teacher 
represents as influencing students, of course person- 
ality is of primary worth. But in the personality 
there are certain elements which should be distin- 
guished. Professor George Herbert Palmer of Harvard, 
himself a teacher who has had a deep and lasting 
influence over thousands of men, has said: “First, a 
teacher must have an aptitude for vicariousness; and 
second, an already accumulated wealth; and third, 
an ability to invigorate life through knowledge; and 
*“The Challenge of Youth,” by Alfred E. Stearns, pp. 70, 
72-73.  
-P-A-G-E-105
Forces 93 
fourth, a readiness to be forgotten.’"* But to these 
four elements which Professor Palmer notes, I would 
add the quality of analysis. The power to separate 
the elements of a complex condition is one of the 
greatest worths of a teacher. Complex conditions face 
thoughtful men in actual life. To prepare the student 
for the proper dealing with them is a primary function 
of the teacher. The teachers at Brown University, 
above the teachers of most colleges, seem to train men 
in the discipline of this force. The education which 
President Wayland gave his students, seventy-five 
years ago, has been continued in the successive college 
generations. The typical graduate of Brown Uni- 
versity acknowledges the value of this power in his 
actual dealings with the entanglements of life. An 
outstanding lawyer has said that, in drawing up a 
complex contract, he often thinks of the persons and 
of the discipline given him at Brown University. 
As I pass on to other forms, forces, and conditions 
of education, the teacher still remains the centre of 
the circle. Better a great teacher with a small subject, 
as a value in education, than the small teacher giving 
instruction in a great subject. As Lord Morley says, 
in writing of Mill, “The mind of the teacher is more 
than his doctrine.” It is also to be noted, as Professor 
Palmer says, that the remembrance of the teacher far 
““The Teacher,’ by George Herbert Palmer and Alice

-P-A-G-E-106
  94 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
outlives the remembrance of the subject taught: “In 
those halcyon days of our boys and girls we have a 
share, and the golden lights which flood the opening 
years are reflected on us. Though our pupils cannot 
follow our efforts in their behalf, and indeed ought 
not,—it being our art to conceal our art,—yet they 
perceive that in the years when their happy expansion 
occurred we were their guides. To us, therefore, their 
blind affections cling as to few beside their parents.’?5 
Section 2 
The Newspaper 
In addition to the more regular forms and forces, 
there have, in recent years, sprung up somewhat irreg- 
ular types of education. 
The first of these irregular types which I consider 
is the newspaper. For not a few people, and some of 
them of the thoughtful class, regard education by the 
newspaper as one of the most precious of all values. 
For, above every other people, the American is the 
nation of the daily newspaper. The English have 
more and better quarterly reviews and worthier weekly 
journals; and yet America is the land of the paper of 
the morning, of the evening, of almost every hour 
between the morning and the evening. 
In his essay on Pope, De Quincey discriminates 
*“The Teacher,” by George Herbert Palmer and Alice 
Freeman Palmer, p. 29.
-P-A-G-E-107
Forces 95 
between the literature of knowledge and the literature 
of power. He says: “The function of the first is, to 
teach; the function of the second is, to move: the first 
is a rudder, the second an oar or a sail. The first 
speaks to the mere discursive understanding; the sec- 
ond speaks ultimately, it may happen, to the higher 
understanding or reason, but always through affections 
of pleasure and sympathy.”'® The daily newspaper, 
of course, represents the literature, or the education, 
of information. It is eager to seek and to supply in- 
formation. Its comment is vigilant and usually posi- 
tive. Its sympathy with social and political feelings 
is quick. It-is a daily presentation and interpreta- 
tion of the world. A great journalist, great in unique- 
ness of interesting service, as well as of length, Charles 
A. Dana, speaking in the year of 1893 to the students 
of Union College, said: 
“Tt is a necessity, and it is very costly, to collect 
and to bring here to Schenectady, for instance, for 
printing to-morrow morning, the news of the whole 
world, from England, from Germany, from Russia, 
from France, from Africa, from South America, from 
the Pacific, so that it may be presented to the reader 
who takes up the paper to-morrow, and he may have 
a panorama of all the events of the preceding day.

“Tt is expected that I shall say something here 
to-day about the newspaper and the art of making 
it. The newspaper is an article of primary necessity. 
You must have your breakfast, but you must have 
your newspaper too, Without it we don’t know what 
has happened in the world, we don’t know what new 
ideas, we don’t know what shocking events, we don’t 
know what well-founded or what fantastical hopes are 
looming before the minds of the masses of men. We 
don’t even know who is married.”** 
The worthy newspaper of any capital, be it the 
Times of London, or the La Nacion of Buenos Aires, 
is a picture of yesterday’s or of to-day’s world. It is, 
indeed, of great worth to see, to hear, to feel the world, 
and of yet greater worth to interpret the world. The 
information thus presented is almost as measureless 
and diverse as are the physical and executive processes

necessary for the creating of the material result. That 
the newspaper should present and represent the world, 
and not any one part of it, Mr. Dana contends: 
“The newspaper must be founded upon human 
nature. It must correspond to the wants of the 
people. It must furnish that sort of information 
which the people demand, or else it never can be 
successful. The first thing which an editor must look 
for is news. If the newspaper has not the news, it may 
have everything else, yet it will be comparatively un- 
successful; and by news I mean everything that occurs, 
everything which is of human interest, and which is 
of sufficient importance to arrest and absorb the atten- 
tion of the public or of any considerable part of it. 
There is a great disposition in some quarters to say 
that the newspapers ought to limit the amount of 
news that they print; that certain kinds of news 
ought not to be published. I do not know how that is. 
I am not prepared to maintain any abstract propo- 
sition in that line; but I have always felt that what- 
ever the Divine Providence permitted to occur I was 
not too proud to report.’”* 
“Tt [the newspaper] is a picture of the world as it 
is; of the good men and of the bad men, the virtues 
and the crimes; and as the crimes of half a dozen are 
more startling and tend more to arrest our attention

Newspaper,” pp. 11-12.

than the virtues of a thousand good men, it is to the 
crimes that a great deal of attention is necessarily 
paid. But is it wrong to report and to publish these 
things? Everybody will talk about them. The news- 
papers could not suppress them if they would; and if 
any one newspaper regularly omitted to give an ac~ 
count of interesting swindles, or forgeries, or murders, 
the people would stop reading that paper and go off 
and get one where they could find all the news. 
Besides, I have been led to conclude, in reasoning 
upon this subject, that if the Divine Providence per~ 
mits such things to happen, we, who are merely the 
witnesses of its operation, may certainly stop a mo- 
ment and report the facts to each other.’2° 
The vital and primary question arises: Does such 
reading of each day constitute an education of the 
highest value? The answer is inevitable. 
The education which is given by the newspaper is 
an education of knowledge, of information, of an 
  acquaintance with the world. But it is an education 
not of knowledge well arranged, carefully classified, 
assessed at just values, presented in orderly and fitting 
form. It is a presentation largely composed of des- 
patches, by telegraph or telephone, these despatches 
themselves written under immediate stress and im- 
pulse and without a sense of large relations. The 
”“The Art of Newspaper Making,” lecture on “Making of 
a Newspaper Man,” pp. 85-86.

paper is a news paper. “All the news” is the motto. 
Not only all the news which is “fit to print,” but of 
much which, in the opinion of certain readers, is fitted 
neither to be printed nor to be read. The interpreta- 
tion given to the news is quite another question. The 
interpretation is usually read by only the thoughtful 
who appreciate interpretation. The mind, therefore, 
which seeks to get an education of value from the 
constant reading of the daily newspaper would become 
a hodgepodge of colliding forces, an unclassified 
library in which international law would be mixed 
with Milton’s poems, and books on the differential 
equations would stand side by side with the Waverly 
novels, and research in pure chemistry would rest 
down upon Schopenhauer’s “World as Will and as 
Idea.” As Charles R. Miller, for many years, through 
the New York Times, a great force in American jour- 
nalism, said in a conference held at Princeton Uni- 
versity: 
“A man of my calling, comfortably assiduous and 
having length of years, puts into print the equivalent 
of a hundred octavo volumes of 350 pages each. Who 
in the realm of pure literature writes so much? It is 
not literature, it would miss the mark if it were; but 
its object is best attained if it have the form and 
quality of literature. To the multitude it is the abid- 
ing and most familiar example in the use of language 
in other than spoken form. It is quite unnecessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
to argue that a stream from which so many take their 
fill should be kept pure at the source. Standards may 
be kept inviolate by the pen of genius writing for the 
cloistered few; current speech takes its form very 
much from the daily newspaper.”*! 
Dr. Talcott Williams once said to me that his 
editorial and other writing was equal to half the vol- 
umes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica; and good 
reading it is, too. 
The education which the newspaper can and does 
give is the education which knowledge represents. Its 
reading should be pursued, like the marriage service, 
discreetly even if not reverently. Thoughtful under- 
standing and appreciation form the mood of such daily 
reading. When reading is thus done, it aids in giving 
an education, But it should never be regarded as 
constituting an education, and, in particular, never 
for an instant as constituting an education of the 
highest worth. It does not stand for power. 
Section 3 
General Reading 
More efficient for securing a worthier education 
than the newspaper offers, and yet not one of the 
worthiest type, is what is known as general reading. 
The community is inclined to interpret general read- 
ing, however, as a form of education of the highest 
value. 
* From the Boston Transcript, July 22, 1922. 
   
-P-A-G-E-113
  Forces 101 
General reading at its best represents the reading 
of the best books on the most important subjects. 
It is a method making special appeal to the man 
who is denied formal and prolonged schooling. Its 
successful pursuit involves certain presuppositions 
or implications: First, an aim placed so far off and 
so high as to quicken pursuit, but not so remote as to 
seem to make attainment impossible. The aim should 
be rather practical than theoretical. To secure ad- 
vantages in one’s calling is more compelling and com- 
manding to most men than the purpose to possess 
general cultivation. Second, from the dominance of 
a constructive aim is to be drawn a system of reading. 
This system forbids dissipation. It prevents intel- 
lectual vagabondage. It holds the literary traveler 
down to one road, even if this road be accompanied 
by side-paths. From excursions into these side- 
paths, however, he will come back with a fresher zeal 
to the main road. Under its system, he may read 
either chronologically or comparatively. He may take 
the voyage on the stream of time, beginning at its 
source with the earliest books on his chosen subject 
and come down to to-day’s volumes, or he may begin 
with the volumes of this year and go back to the 
earliest. Each method has its advantages and dis- 
advantages. To begin with the present and to go 
back is the more interesting and commanding. One 
may also read by the comparative method. He may
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
select the best books in his subjects, read them one by 
one, contrasting them, weighing them. For example: 
a young architect, without a thorough and prolonged 
education which the historic profession should repre- 
sent, may read the lives of the great architects as they 
succeed or precede each other for two thousand years 
and more. Choosing the biographies of the great 
members of the great calling, he compares them each 
with the other: Michael Angelo with Brunelleschi, and 
Brunelleschi with Sir Christopher Wren, and, to take 
a long leap, Wren with Bulfinch and Bulfinch with 
Richardson. Third, the undertaking of such a course 
of general reading implies certain literary apprecia- 
tions. It stands for good taste. It represents a 
high emotion directed toward or through literature. 
It intimates fine origins and noble atmospheres of 
personality. It stands for a power higher than is 
embodied in the understanding of black letters on a 
white page. Fourth, such a course represents a will 
which has sustaining force. Patience, tenacity, per- 
sistence are the three graces and virtues which are to 
go along with the process. Fifth, it also embodies 
what may be called an economical habit of mind. It 
represents the power to save small pieces of time. It 
is the minute mind, ready to serve, ready to think, at 
a minute’s notice, and ready also to think for a minute 
if the hour be denied. Lord Kelvin well illustrates 
such a method and habit. Sixth, such intellectual 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  Forces 103 
economy also implies a facile mind, able to turn 
quickly from one subject to another and to return 
with equal ease and speed. Seventh, with such facility 
should be united intellectual concentration. The intel- 
lectual bite or grip should be firm, fixed, while it 
should be also easily loosened. Eighth, the physical 
conditions should be made such as to promote atten- 
tion. A certain hour, or half-hour, of each day, should 
be set aside. If one or two places in house or room, 
or workshop or office, could be reserved for such read- 
ing, the desired result could be gained with less waste 
of time, with less dissipation of attention, and with 
less friction of feeling and of will. 
All these conditions and forces, both personal and 
exterior, are hard to get. They are precious posses- 
sions. They intimate a noble ideal. Yet, if they can- 
not be fully secured, as they seldom can be, one should 
still feel justified in seeking to educate himself through 
the reading of the best books on the most important 
subjects. 
For the results flowing forth from such a type of 
education may be of a value as priceless as is human 
character. The one comprehensive and consummate 
result is that it gives and increases that precious trea- 
sure which all men have aspired after, have thought 
of, and have imagined since the world began. That 
result is a rich mind, a full mind. Such an education 
makes a mind which is a treasure-house of the world’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
goods. It also gives a mind which has a certain sense 
of relations. The mind is brought into knowledges 
like and unlike its own which it had formerly pos- 
sessed. It sees things both in comparison and in 
contrast. 
Of course, with these worthy results go along also 
certain limitations. A course in general’ reading does 
not normally create the disciplined mind. It gives the 
knowing, without the carefully thinking, mind. It 
gives the full, without giving the working, mind. It 
makes the mind a stomach without enlarging or 
strengthening the mind as a muscle. It is also subject 
to the limitation of failing to create a sense of intel- 
lectual proportions or a sense of intellectual valua- 
tions. For it lacks the aid of the teacher. It is not 
blessed with that discipline of good teaching which 
differentiates between the significant and the insig- 
nificant, between the fundamental and the superficial, 
between the lasting and the perishable, between the 
formative and the constructive, between the incidental 
or accidental and the essential. 
But, in a comparative way, education by general 
reading has advantages far outbalancing the disad- 
vantages of no education, or of the education of the 
newspaper. One does not forget Elihu Burritt or 
Hugh Miller. One recalls, in one’s own experience, 
instances no less impressive, even if less conspicuous, 
than that of the “learned blacksmith.” Such a type of 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  Forces 105 
education often quickens a desire for an education of 
a yet better type. If in one it develops self-com- 
placency in the personal comparison, in others it de- 
velops humility in the fact of the vision of the infinite 
field of knowledge. It is a case in which the good is 
proved to be, not the foe, but the friend, of the better 
and of the best. 
Suction 4 
Travel : 
Yet another form and force of irregular education 
greatly esteemed by the community is called the edu- 
cation of travel. The two great forces in life and 
education are truth and personality. The education 
which travel gives is chiefly an education by means 
of truth. Personality plays a less constant part, 
though at times one most important. 
The truth which travel uses as a means of education 
is truth obtained largely through the eyes. The edu- 
cation of travel is observation. It lies in seeing things. 
The world makes its appeal to the individual through 
each of the five senses; but the eye conveys a larger 
amount of the material for knowledge than hearing, 
smelling, tasting, or touching. If, to the infant, the 
physical world is primarily a world to be touched, to 
the adult its chief relation is a world to be seen. 
“Seeing the world,” interprets the world, as “seeing 
life” is supposed to interpret life. The dazzling, far-off 
glories of the Himalayas, the harsh, forbidding bar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
renness of the brown slopes of the Andes, the endless 
stretch of the ocean, the picturesqueness of Japanese 
landscapes, the tropical luxuriousness of Hawaiian or 
Ceylon forest and foliage, the barren waste of the dry, 
brown, wind-swept plains of northern India or of 
northern China, represent the truth which observation 
offers. Likewise, passing from landscape to man and 
his works, the low, squatty, begrimed, insect-infested 
hovels of hundreds of thousands of villages cf the 
Orient, the thin, slight costumes of crimson and orange 
of Japanese and of Hindu, the noble refinement and 
elaborate simplicity of the Taj Mahal and other me- 
morial tombs of Agra and Delhi, the kaleidoscope of 
street and bazaar in every oriental town, also repre- 
sent the truth which observation offers. It is truth as 
vast as nature, as diverse as life. To come to possess 
as one’s own any part of this infinite field, either in its 
largest relations, or in its infinitesimal divisions, is a 
form of knowledge which education can not but regard 
as of most precious value. Such knowledge stands 
for remoteness from the provincial, the parochial, the 
local. It means a world-citizenship. It intimates sym- 
pathy, breadth, largeness. It also represents mental 
fullness and richness. But knowledge thus gained is 
chiefly knowledge in the mass. It is a conglomerate, 
composed of tens of thousands of separate parts and 
truths unrelated, flung together, without a basis of 
principle or a category of orderliness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
    Forces 107 
Such knowledge is of small worth, either as truth or 
as power. This conglomeration is to be interpreted, 
and being interpreted, is to be classified. Each fact 
is to be seen, not simply in itself, but in relation to 
other facts. Each fact is only one member of a series; 
it is to be seen as a resultant of causes preceding it in 
time, surrounding it in space, and also itself as a cause 
which shall in turn produce other results also. One 
may look upon the far-off, sky-kissing peak of Mt. 
Everest, or the volcanic formations of Japanese islands 
as a geologist, and find in these formations evidence 
of the globe’s history; or he may look upon them with 
the eye of the artist; or still he may see them, as most 
do see them, with a sense of unreasoning wonder and 
astonishment; but, however seen, they do receive an 
interpretation either scientific or aesthetic, or broadly 
human. The world of man may also be seen as a col- 
lection either of political, or of social, or of economic, 
or of martial forces. One is always to see with dis- 
crimination. Discrimination precedes interpretation, 
and interpretation should result in classification. No 
one, for instance, can mistake the strong, massive, im- 
mobile face and heavy form of the Chinese for the 
small, weak, mobile face and slight body of the Hindu. 
The Mongolian is not the Aryan. 
But truth is not only to be seen, interpreted, classi- 
fied,—it is also to be assimilated. It is to become a 
part of the individual. Education by means of truth
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
demands that knowledge shall be incarnated in the 
life and character of the traveler. It is sadly evident 
that not many travelers do fully assimilate the knowl- 
edge which the round world offers with liberal profuse- 
ness. Many see without interpreting, more see and 
interpret without classifying, and a still larger num- 
ber see, interpret, and classify without making truth 
and truths a part of their being. They return from 
long pilgrimages the same individuals who departed, 
neither enlarged nor enriched. Knowledge, like cloth- 
ing, has not become assimilated when it rests upon 
one as a coat to be put on or to be put off at pleasure. 
Knowledge, like food, becomes assimilated when it has 
been unconsciously made a part of one’s being; it has 
thus entered into every faculty and strengthened every 
function. The education of travel requires that the 
knowledge of truth shall become a part of one’s being. 
But the highest element in the getting of the truth 
which travel offers is the element of appreciation. 
Appreciation presupposes and embraces observation, 
interpretation, classification and assimilation. It is at 
once an intellectual and an emotional condition. It is 
a verity, a virtue and a grace. It belongs alike to the 
head and to the heart. It belongs to the head in its 
primary stages and forms; to the heart in its final and 
highest development. It stands for both cause and 
effect, and also for conditions. It transcends observa- 
tion, interpretation and classification, as interpretation 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  Forces 109 
and classification transcend observation. Appreciation 
includes the feeling of the significance of phenomena 
and movement as well as the understanding of them. 
The man of appreciation pausing before the monu- 
ment of the Angel and the Cross at the memorial 
grave in Cawnpore feels the meaning of the suffering 
and the triumph of the women and the children who 
met death in the great Mutiny. His eye sees; his 
intellect understands; his heart is stirred. The man 
of appreciation beholding the bullet-scarred walls of 
the British compound at Peking, seeing the words 
“Lest We Forget,” is thrilled with emotions over the 
quiet courage and noble endurance of the hundreds 
who faced death daily for months, and death, too, 
which was more than dying. The Nile pyramids, the 
Roman Forum, the furrowed streets of Pompeii, the 
shivered Parthenon,—works of men,—or the works of 
the Creator, as the yellow Tiber, or the narrow Bos- 
phorus, all move and thrill. For in them humanity 
has come to its highest and whitest crests of either 
association, achievement, or fulfillment. 
Observation, interpretation, classification, assimila- 
tion, appreciation, these are the five points of the edu- 
cational creed of the traveler. They are the five 
points, too, of every education wherever and however 
given or received. They are at once causes and con- 
tents, conditions and results. But as causes and con- 
ditions they do represent certain educational results 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110. = What Education Has the Most Worth? 
of the highest significance, results which are implicitly 
involved in the causes themselves. 
But besides the education given by means of the 
knowledge which travel offers, there is, as I have inti- 
mated, education by means of personality. Every 
one going into a foreign country should avail himself 
of the opportunities which may fittingly be opened for 
knowing great men. Great men are the guiding forces 
of a nation. They.are a microcosm of a people. They 
stand in the present for what the whole nation may 
become in the future. At least of the earlier time, no 
American went to Europe more adequately provided 
with letters of introduction to scholars, diplomats, and 
princes than George Ticknor, and no one ever used 
the advantages thus offered with keener discretion or 
richer gains for himself. 
A further result of the education which travel gives 
is intellectual enlargement and enrichment. The mind 
is liberalized; it is set free; its narrowness becomes 
breadth; its shallowness depth. The mind passes, 
from being a line to being a square, and from being 
a square to being a cube. To length it adds breadth, 
and to both depth. It sees things not so much in 
themselves as in relations. It understands; it analyzes, 
and, as Dr. Holmes intimates and as these pages affirm, 
in analysis lies education. It weighs evidence; it gives 
to a fact a proper value; to a truth a just meaning. 
Its circle of information and understanding widens.
-P-A-G-E-123
  Forces Day 
Its plummet lengthens, and the bottom of its ocean of 
thought and feeling goes down deeper. The soil of 
its reflections and emotions receives a new layer of 
the falling and enriching leaves of ripened experiences. 
Another result of the education of travel lies in the 
increase of one’s resources. The enlarged worth of 
mind and of heart becomes a power to bless and to 
help, to comfort and to guide others as well as oneself. 
It forms a reserve fund to be used daily, and also, if 
need be, to be drawn upon in crises. Some men’s 
minds are like the shop-windows and show-cases of 
small dealers, who put there all their goods; other 
men’s minds are like the storehouses of. great mer- 
chants, who decline to make display, but who, when 
proper demand is made, bring forth rich accumulations 
to aid and to serve. Men who properly use travel 
gather great riches which they are unwilling to barter, 
but are willing to spend for others or for self. Such 
a mind was Darwin’s, to whom travel brought mate- 
rial for his most daring biological inductions. Such 
a mind, too, was that of one of the greatest of modern 
scientists, Kelvin, who stood ready to use his vast 
store of knowledge to bless humanity, sending mes- 
sages under the oceans, and making the sailors’ task 
upon those oceans easier and safer. Such a mind was 
that of Pasteur, the greatest of Frenchmen, and one 
of the most human and humane men of all humanity. 
Closely allied with the increased resource of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
112. =What Education Has the Most Worth? 
individual is the grace of humility which travel cul- 
tivates. Enlargement of knowledge, however gained, 
should result in a deepened humility. The man who 
knows most is most conscious of what he knows not. 
The enlargement of the circle of knowledge on its 
inner side is the enlargement of the circle of ignorance 
on its outer side. The traveler who starts on his 
journey, convinced that there is only one proper 
method of being clothed, of erecting a building, of 
keeping a house, of carrying on a business, of admin- 
istering a college, of curing a patient, of prosecuting 
a law suit, or even of divine worship, should return 
with the belief that the modes of helpful and tasteful 
dress are many, that the ways of building and keeping 
a house vary from a Japanese cottage to a palm-leaf 
hut, and that the forms of divine worship may be as 
diverse as are the needs of the human soul. Travel 
removes arrogance, haughtiness, intolerance. It gives 
willingness to respect others’ opinions, to suffer others’ 
prejudices,—if prejudices they be,—to recognize points 
of view and standards other than one’s own, and to 
find in other nations and other personalities some 
qualities higher than are found among one’s own 
people, or in one’s own bosom. 
Travel is also an education in efficiency. This 
result is gained in ways both negative and positive, 
The peoples of the whole world are, on the whole, 
inefficient in their doing. They do not take fore- 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
Forces 113 
thought; they do not select out of several ways the 
best way of achieving; and they are inclined to let 
performance wait upon intention. The life in China, 
India, Ceylon, Egypt, Spain, is a life rather of pas- 
sive condition than of aggressive forcefulness. An 
Englishman or American is impressed with the loss 
which each nation suffers through its lack of efficiency. 
The world is still a wasteful world. The sin and the 
mistake of inefficiency and wastefulness quicken the 
traveler unto economic aggressiveness and aggressive 
economy. 
A still further result of the education of travel lies 
in the inspiration of service for all men. This result 
does not invariably emerge. For so vast is the world, 
so intricate the world’s problems, so deep the world’s 
needs, that one may be inclined to ask why should 
one disturb himself in order to make his little con- 
tribution for the world’s benefit. The contribution 
can make no appreciable alleviation of the world’s 
suffering, and give no discernible light in the world’s 
night. Such questioning, however, is not the mood of 
the healthful or healthy mind. Such questioning is 
in the mood of intellectual weariness and emotional 
dissipation, of ethical and religious pessimism. Rather 
the natural mood is of increased desire, as well as of 
enlarged power, to help. The world’s need is so deep, 
the world’s darkness so black, the world’s sore, whether 
in Africa or in Asia, is so sore, the world’s blunder- 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  114. What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ing so dense, the world’s contentment with what is 
not best so blind, that the man whom travel educates 
is eager to make an offering, be it ever so small, for 
the world’s enlightening, guiding, strengthening, sooth- 
ing and comforting. When Lord Shaftesbury lay dying 
at the age of eighty-four, after a lifetime spent in 
alleviating the lot of the poor and the suffering, he 
cried out, “And must I die and leave the world with 
all this suffering in it?” 
But there is one result of the education which travel 
is supposed to give which is not good, and which in any 
true interpretation should be noted. It is the result 
lying in intellectual and other dissipation. By “other” 
I mean much more than intellectual, large as that is. 
I mean the scattering of life’s purpose and great pur- 
poses, the thinning-out of the interpretation of the 
objects toward which worthy struggle is directed, the 
disintegration of the forces which do or should tend 
upward,—in a single word, I mean the weakening of 
the will. In some colleges and schools are found 
students who have remained so long that the aim of 
their first coming has been forgotten. Year after year 
they stay on, taking enough studies to retain the right 
of residence, yet not approaching a bit nearer to what 
most men regard as the goal of a liberal education. 
They are neither intellectually virtuous, nor intellec- 
tually vicious; they are quiet non-entities. They are 
always becoming, but never become; they are always 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Forces 196 
going, but never arriving. Travel, long-continued, is 
liable to work a like result upon the traveler. It in- 
capacitates him; it cuts the nerve of the mission of his 
life; it weakens without destroying; it emasculates 
without giving any result of fineness or of taste; it 
makes character thin without making it broad; it pro- 
duces intellectual and moral ennui without quickening 
dissatisfaction sufficient to arouse; it gives a man 
appetite for the lotus-root which, though not very 
good itself, is yet good enough to keep him from try- 
ing to get something better. 
Behind the content and the substance of the edu- 
cation which travel offers, and leading to the results 
which this form of education achieves, lie the method 
and the force for getting this education. Into this 
form of training, as into every form, one should enter 
bearing a keen intellectual inquisitiveness. He should 
wish to know, and to know the fundamental as 
well as the superficial, the lasting as well as the tem- 
porary, elements of the life of a people. Surely if 
he lack this wish, he will return home well nigh as 
ignorant as he was on his departure. This desire 
serves as a motive power in promoting research, in 
enduring hardships, in seeking out individuals, in 
asking questions, in advancing the whole process of 
learning. From this fact follows easily the inference 
that one should travel when intellectual curiosity fills 
a large place in one’s constitution. Intellectual curi-

osity may lessen and may at last entirely fade out. 
The journey of Velasquez to Italy helped to determine 
his career, for it was made at a stage when his mind 
was active and his power of acquiring great. Walter 
Scott went to Italy when his brain was tired and his 
hand feeble. Rome and her three civilizations had 
slight influence over him. Italy for more than a hun- 
dred years taught and inspired the northern nations 
through their citizens who dwelt in Florence and 
Rome; but these men of the north usually came unto 
her in the period of their intellectual enthusiasms. 
With intellectual inquisitiveness should be united 
moral thoughtfulness. If intellectual inquisitiveness 
represents acts, or a series of acts, moral thoughtful- 
ness represents rather a mood or atmosphere of the 
individual. The most important elements and phe- 
nomena of a nation are moral. Behind the decay of 
Greece from social causes, and the decline of Rome 
from political, lay moral conditions. Behind the in- 
dustrial forces making modern England, or America, 
lie moral forces, giving temper and quickening to the 
material. The traveler of a mood of moral thought- 
fulness seeks and is more able to find the moral ele- 
ments of a nation, or of a community. The traveler 
who goes to any oriental country without such a mood 
investing him as a garment will be impressed by, and 
will gather up only, the elements of exterior pictur- 
esqueness. His character will receive no enrichment,
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Forces A 
and his intellect no proper enlightenment. The world 
is, on the whole, a world resting on a moral founda- 
tion. This moral condition gives itself to the heart 
and the mind only of him who approaches it in moral 
sympathy and moral reverence. John Ruskin is a 
great interpreter of our literature and of our architec- 
ture largely by reason of the moral atmosphere of his 
character. It is their emphasis on the moralities which 
gives to Mill and to Morley no slight share of their 
influence. 
In fostering the education of travel a high place 
should be assigned to the value of the sense of humor. 
Travel involves annoyances of all sorts, from one’s 
own hunger and sleeplessness to the boorishness and 
faithlessness of those who should be courteous and 
honest. But each annoyance, however irritating, pro- 
vided it contains no immoral element, may have its 
part of the ridiculous. The ridiculous is frequently 
met with, and is usually not hard to find. A friend 
of mine in Madura, Southern India, had a servant 
who was found beating his wife. His mistress told 
the man she could not keep a servant who beat his 
wife. “What shall I do,” said the servant, “Is not 
marriage made for the comfort of man?” When 
Phillips Brooks was in Japan at one time waiting for 
a delayed train, he and his traveling companion, also 
large of stature, were taken for American wrestlers 
who had come to Japan to exhibit their strength and 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    118 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
skill. I am not told whether they gave to the little 
folks of the little islands a public exhibition of their 
prowess. Talking once with the conductor of a dining- 
car on the Union Pacific Railroad, I remarked upon 
the unreasonableness of passengers and upon the im- 
possibility of a conductor making answer to imperti- 
nence. “Yes,” he said, “we have a swearing-box up on 
the road into which we go sometimes and relieve our- 
selves.” 
One may be suffered to say that in getting the full 
advantage of the education of travel, the virtue and 
the grace of courtesy is to be exercised. Travel often 
seems to represent the mistake, the fault and the vice 
of boorishness. It embodies a constant and silly strug- 
gle for the best: the best tables in the dining-room; 
the best seats in the railroad cars; the best carriages at 
the station; the best places for chairs on the steamer- 
deck. Travel brings out the innate and acquired 
selfishness and boorishness of man. But courtesy still 
represents the wiser method. Courtesy results, in the 
long run, in richer material results than selfishness. 
Selfishness should really lead one to the grace of un- 
selfishness. For courtesy must, abroad as well as at 
home, spring from genuine regard for one’s fellow- 
travelers. In it are recognized all rights, and in it also 
is embodied the right to give up one’s own rights. 
The sympathy out of which courtesy arises has a 
still wider and deeper application. The traveler is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  Forces 119 
enter a country bearing a heart and mind sympathetic 
with that country. Let him enter with a mind so 
broad that, while not neglecting to understand national 
limitations, he shall not fail to appreciate the causes 
of these limitations. Let him neither unduly appre- 
ciate advantages nor unduly depreciate disadvantages. 
Never let him enter either Thibet or Afghanistan,— 
if he can get into either country,—in a spirit of an- 
tagonism. If he does enter in this spirit, he will come 
away—if he comes away at all—a smaller self than 
he entered. Antagonism closes the doors of knowl- 
edge; sympathy opens them; antagonism dulls appre- 
ciation; sympathy quickens; antagonism narrows; 
sympathy broadens. The sympathy should be both 
intellectual and emotional, each acting on and re- 
enforcing the other. The traveler, like the mission- 
ary, finds he secures results the richer as his sympathy 
is the heartier. Are not Dickens’ “Notes on America” 
less valuable because he had so little sympathy with 
the new country of which he wrote? 
The most comprehensive thing to be said about the 
methods and means for securing the richest worth of 
the education of travel is that one is to take best care 
of the intellectual self. Oneself represents the capital 
stock of the traveler. Any impairment of its resources 
is disastrous. If this stock be kept at its full earning 
capacity, rich dividends and large increments of ad- 
vantage are assured. Most travelers fail to appreciate 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
the proper worth of themselves. Their appreciation 
of the value of their purse is keener than their appre- 
ciation of the value of their brains. They spend 
money freely; they do not freely use their intellectual 
force. 
The physical health, too, is of primary worth. The 
danger of its suffering by irregular habits is great; the 
risk of its impairment by under-eating, by over-eating, 
by ill-regulated eating, is constant. Sleep is in peril 
of being damaged; and opportunities for exercise are 
naturally limited. The intellect becomes wearied. It 
ceases to respond to the attractions of the world’s ex- 
terior, or to quicken itself by or for thinking. Even 
the heart, as in intense joy or sorrow, becomes ex- 
hausted. Exterior causes directly promote exhaustion. 
The new sounds and the new sights—much heard or 
much seen—the new methods of life and work, all new 
conditions calling out either enthusiasm or disgust, 
make drafts on every resource. Unconscious, as well 
as conscious, forces work to deplete strength. The 
traveler is in peril of becoming, like the boating or the 
football man, overtrained, stale. He can not do or 
give his best, or receive what is best for him to receive. 
Travel, in such a condition, is as useless as a college 
education given to a youth without the quality of 
responsiveness. Friends of mine making a trip round 
the world rested every third day; out of each week 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  Forces 121 
at least two days were sacredly set aside for purposes 
of recreation. 
Taken at the right age, taken under good condi- 
tions, the education of travel is of great worth. The 
age usually chosen is rather too early than too late, 
except for the lad of intellectual parts. Taken before 
the age of eighteen, unless the mind is inquisitive, it 
is seldom of full worth. Taken after graduation at 
college, it represents the proper age and degree of 
education. The education of travel well supplements 
to the sober-minded youth the education of the college. 
The young graduate still holds his powers of observa- 
tions acute, and he is also in the age of intellectual 
discrimination and of moral thoughtfulness. He is 
able to compare as well as to observe. Wide travel- 
ing also, occasionally pursued throughout one’s in- 
creasing years, is a continuation of education which 
helps to make life rich in thoughtfulness, broad in 
tolerance, tender in sympathy, and of the noblest 
effectiveness. 
Section 5 
Human Association 
A further somewhat irregular form or agency for 
getting an education which has most worth lies in 
what is known as association with men. To this 
agency is given a high degree of appreciation by minds 
of a general type of cultivation. The reason of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  122. What Education Has the Most Worth? 
appreciation is found, at least in part, in the failure 
to differentiate educational causes from educational 
effects. Often a fitting association with good people 
represents one of the noble results of education. The 
result is so advantageous that the unreasoning mind 
is inclined to interpret this condition as the essence of 
education itself or as a primary cause of, or element 
in, education. 
It is, of course, not to be denied that association 
with men and women of education and with persons 
of all sorts and conditions has educational value. The 
association may be of a general character. It may 
also take on certain particular or special elements. 
Such association, that beloved friend, skilled diagnos- 
tician, wise teacher, Dr. William Osler, commended 
to medical students. He said, in an address on student 
life: “The strength of a student of men is to travel— 
to study men, their habits, character, mode of life, 
their behavior under varied conditions, their vices, 
virtues, and peculiarities. Begin with a careful obser- 
vation of your fellow students and of your teachers; 
then, every patient you see is a lesson in much more 
than the malady from which he suffers. Mix as much 
as you possibly can with the outside world, and learn 
its ways. Cultivated systematically, the student so- 
cieties, the students’ union, the gymnasium, and the 
outside social circle will enable you to conquer the 
diffidence so apt to go with bookishness and which 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
Forces 123 
may prove a very serious drawback in after-life. I 
cannot too strongly impress upon the earnest and 
attentive men among you the necessity of overcoming 
this unfortunate failing in your student days. It is 
not easy for every one to reach a happy medium, and 
the distinction between a proper self-confidence and 
‘cheek,’ particularly in junior students, is not always 
to be made. The latter is met with chiefly among the 
student pilgrims who, in traveling down the Delectable 
Mountains, have gone astray and have passed to the 
left hand, where lieth the country of Conceit, the coun- 
try in which you remember the brisk lad Ignorance 
met Christian.”?” 
This association, too, may be of a narrower group. 
It may belong to comradeship with those of one’s own 
folk and working kind. A lawyer, as great in his field 
as was Osler in the medical, Joseph H. Choate, writes 
in his brief autobiography, of the worth of his associa- 
tion with Harvard men in his undergraduate days, 
seventy years ago: 
“There was one immense advantage which the boys 
of our time at Harvard enjoyed over those of recent 
years, the classes were so small in number that we 
became intimately acquainted with each other, much 
more intimately than at any subsequent period of life 
with any similar number of acquaintances, understood 
=The ‘Student Life’* by William Osler, published in 
“Modern Essays,” by Christopher Morley, pp. 141-142, 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
124 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
one another’s character perfectly, and formed the 
closest ties of friendship and a strong class-feeling 
that continued unbroken through life; while now, as 
I understand, where the classes are numbered by 
hundreds, no such state of thing is possible, and very 
few members of any class know in a similar way the 
whole or even half of their associates. Groups and 
cliques of friends are formed, but there is no genuine 
class-feeling in which all unite as in the old days. I 
think, too, that there was then no such distance be- 
tween the professors and the students as now prevails. 
We came to know them well, and it was quite possible 
for any professor or tutor to become acquainted with 
and to become familiar with the mental and moral 
qualities of the members of each division of the class, 
for in almost all the courses the class was divided 
alphabetically into two divisions.”?* 
The elements of special worth in the education by 
association are: First, the glimpses which such associa- 
tion gives of the character of men and of the interpre- 
tation of facts. The method represents the tangential 
form of understanding. It gives sight and also insight. 
It provides vision, such as the Italian painters used to 
give in their interiors, of sky and of landscape, through 
a door ajar or a window-pane. 
Second, such association should create and nourish 
*“The Life of Joseph Hodges Choate,” by Edward Sandford 
Martin, Vol. I, pp. 73-74, 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  
Forces 125 
respect and regard for men as men, and also for certain 
classes of men with whom one may have special affili- 
ation. To know men is to care for them. Charles 
Lamb’s remark is still true. Such an appreciation and 
love has intellectual worth itself and is the cause and 
creator of intellectual worth. 
Third, such association gives intellectual, ethical, 
and spiritual quickening. The mind is enriched by 
noble associations. The common purposes are made 
high, and the high purposes are lifted yet higher. 
The feelings are moved; the will is strengthened; and 
the conscience purified. The appreciation of all that 
is noble and sublime and beautiful in character is 
deepened. 
Such advantages have great value. Let them be 
recognized and justly assessed. But with them goes 
along a disadvantage which is most serious. This 
disadvantage may be summed up in the phrase of the 
dissipated mind. The dissipated mind has many of 
the qualities of a dissipated character. It represents 
the man or woman who pursues pleasure as an aim 
or a condition in life. It stands for wastefulness of 
personality and not infrequently for wastefulness in 
money. It means the disintegration of life’s strongest 
forces, unwisdom in the use of life’s best powers, and 
degradation in the appreciation of life’s richest values. 
It is indolent in its work and superficial and imme- 
diate in its selfward process. A dissipated mind means 
   
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
a mind thin in knowledge and in thought. Its breadth 
is superficial, its depth is slight, its height low, or, if 
not low, visionary and cloudy. It lacks working 
power. It has no method. Its logic is emotional, its 
philosophy unrational, its psychology of the rule of 
thumb. It knows a bit about many things and not 
much of anything. Its speech flits from topic to topic 
as a butterfly, without the butterfly’s beauty or grace. 
Its power of self-judgment usually results in a high 
degree of self-appreciation. It is the woodpecker 
among the intellectual birds. It picks away at the 
hard substances of the trees of thought without gath- 
ering food for itself from any one, yet possibly sharp- 
ening its sense of curiosity. 
The general education, or education by association, 
which is akin to the dissipated mind, is an education 
which belongs to the later, and not to the earlier, 
stages of the educational career. It should follow, 
and not precede the educational procession. It cannot 
represent or construct the foundations. To make it 
fundamental is to commit the architectural mistake of 
using the ridge-pole of the house for the underpinning. 
At all events, it will be a disappointment to those 
dwelling within its thin walls, and probably the object 
of ridicule to those who see its grotesqueness. Yet 
education by association or personal contacts has 
value. Let its value be recognized, being neither 
magnified nor minimized,

METHODS AND CONDITIONS 
Section 1 
Participation and Interest 
We now pass from the content and forces of edu- 
cation to considerations quite as important, methods 
and conditions. 
The fundamental difference between what is called 
the Old Education and the New is twofold: one part 
of the difference relates to persons and one part to the 
subjects of study. The two facts of the difference 
relating to persons are summed up on the side of the 
Old Education in the word antagonism, and on the 
side of the New Education in the word sympathy. 
These two facts are essentially two sides of the same 
condition. 
In the Old Education there existed between the 
teacher and the student at least remoteness, becoming 
at its worst dislike or contempt on the side of the 
student, and on the side of the teacher indifference. 
Of course there were exceptions or qualifications in 
this duplex unhappiness, partial or complete, which 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
are gratefully remembered. Under the former condi- 
tion, the teacher was the monarch, the student the 
subject; the teacher the authority, the student the 
victim. In the New Education, the relations of the 
two parties to the educational contract are character- 
ized by friendliness and often by friendship. Co-oper- 
ation represents the working process, co-ordination 
the common and happy condition, and sympathy the 
whole-hearted and whole-minded mood and atmos- 
phere. The three historic words, liberty, equality, fra- 
ternity, may be used as fitting interpretations. Liberty 
in education is common. For liberty represents free- 
dom of action among the teachers and among the 
taught. Equality is common. For equality lifts the 
pupil without depressing the teacher. Fraternity is 
common. For brotherhood stands for sympathy in 
mind and in heart. Perhaps the most comprehensive 
word for the New Education, touching the personal 
relationship, is participation. 
The word participation may also be fittingly used 
to represent the relation of the content of education 
to the mind of the student himself. In the process of 
participation is included the mood and doctrine of 
interest. The nature and value of the doctrine of inter- 
est is succinctly interpreted by one of the outstanding 
philosophers of education, John Dewey. “Interest 
indicates that no gulf exists between material to be 
learned, lesson material, and the concrete mind of
-P-A-G-E-141
Methods and Conditions 129 
the pupil—that the mental powers and tendencies find 
themselves at home in the material of study, that the 
material awakens congenial responses in the self. So 
regarded, an interest in a problem, a topic, a subject, 
is evidence that there is a vital union between the 
student and his study. Its opposite is the feeling of 
alienation and. repulsion that accompanies the pre- 
sentation of matter that is foreign to the experience 
of the student. . . . Interest as a state of mind de- 
pends upon the proper balance of the old and the new 
in experience.’ 
Interest in the condition and method of education 
represents, presupposes and creates in the theory and 
in the application, the best instruction and adminis- 
tration. For, interest stands for government without 
ruling, for the creation of such forces that it becomes 
natural to do the fitting thing, and for the making of 
such premises and promises that the conclusion is at 
once happy, inevitable, and creative. It gives to the 
educational commandments the beauty of the edu- 
cational beatitudes, and about these beatitudes, it 
throws the compulsions of the commandments. The 
value of such a condition and method is measureless. 
It represents what is known as the elective system of 
studies in the lower zones, as well as in the higher. It 
means following out those lines of least resistance 
*“Interest,” Cyclopedia of Education, edited by Paul Mon- 
roe, Vol. III, p. 472. 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
130 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
which bear one furthest along the educational road 
of power and of culture. It means economy in the 
spending of educational forces and in the creating and 
measuring of educational values. It means the adding 
of powers and of worths to the intellectual and ethical 
property of the individual and of the whole com- 
munity. 
In promoting this union of the student’s mind with 
the subject of study, or the union of the subject of 
study with the student’s mind, the teacher exercises a 
function most vital. The teacher introduces each to 
the other and helps to hold each closely to the other. 
In fact, the teacher’s chief function is to promote 
this interpenetration until the interest in the subject 
to the student has become so gripping and so vital that 
further devotion of the teacher ceases to be necessary, 
although it remains a quickening force. 
The doctrine of interest takes on many relations. 
Perhaps the most important of these relations may be 
called a co-ordinate relation, or correlation. This 
correlation represents the bearing which each part of 
the subject of study holds to every other part, and also 
the bearing which any one subject holds to other sub- 
jects of study. Its motto might be, “Each for all, all 
for each, each for each, and all for all!” It means 
synthesis and analysis. It stands for breadth in edu- 
cation, for the relation of all subjects to each other, 
rather than for the depth, a depth in which each sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  Methods and Conditions 131 
ject is developed in and into a narrow channel. Cor- 
relation equals interrelation. 
Correlation was, for a time in the last generation, 
the rallying cry in education. In the tendency of the 
American nation to interpret administration in emo- 
tional terms, the method had for a time peculiar 
dominance. The passing of its peculiar dominance 
has, however, left a good influence in illustrating and 
proving the old philosophic doctrine that nothing exists 
apart or alone. All forces bear a relation to each 
other. Each subject in education holds a relationship 
to every other. Geography and history, mathematics 
and physics, chemistry and geology, ancient languages 
and modern, English and every other tongue, repre- 
sent the more common affiliations. The pursuit of 
such affiliations becomes the more fitting and profit- 
able as subjects become more advanced and minds 
more mature. 
Section 2 
The Age of the Student and the Choice of a Calling 
In the whole process of education, the question of 
the age of the student is of primary significance. The 
special form of the problem relates to the adjustment 
of the age of the one studying to the character of the 
studies themselves. From the intellectually simple to 
the less simple, from the less simple to the complex, 
from the somewhat complex to the more complex,
-P-A-G-E-144
  132. What Education Has the Most Worth? 
represents the movement. This movement synchro-~* 
nizes with the increase of years. The progress of the 
two movements should keep step. So far as possible, 
too, the progress should be made individual. As no 
two students are alike in the details of the mental or 
physical nature, yet as all students are alike in the 
principles of their mental and physical structure, so 
the progress should have both certain general resem- 
blances and should represent and incarnate individual 
differences. The less able should not restrain the more 
able, nor the more able irritate the backward by swift 
progress. All education should be and should become 
individualistic. Reasons for the lack of individualism 
and for the presence and power of the class-system lie 
in the cost and in the lack of a proper number of 
proper teachers. But these reasons or causes, by the 
power of a high purpose, by energetic patience, and by 
the more just understanding of the value of education 
to the whole community, will become eliminated. 
In the consideration of the age of the student in 
relation to studies emerges a question often intimated, 
to wit, at what time in one’s life should a vocation 
be fully and finally chosen? The answer, however, is 
not far to seek, though often sought for afar by 
parents. A vocation should not be selected until a 
boy or girl has passed the change which I call the 
intellectual new birth. The intellectual new birth is 
a most important fact in and of itself, and also equally
-P-A-G-E-145
  
Methods and Conditions 133 
important in determining the choice of one’s whole 
formal career. The most interesting period, too, in 
the life of any person is that marked by the awaken- 
ing of the intellect. I do not mean that the intellect 
has not been more or less awake from the very begin- 
ning of its existence. Every act of the senses implies 
that the mind is active. But I do mean that there 
comes a time in the life of most persons of intellectual 
tastes and conditions when the powers of thought and 
reason become forces mightier and larger than were 
formerly possessed or employed. Such persons spring 
from intellectual boyhood or girlhod into intellectual 
maturity. They put away childish things. So great 
is the change that it may be called fittingly the intel- 
lectual new birth or the intellectual second birth. It 
is a change in which the powers outside of oneself 
which promote thought unite with the powers within 
oneself which also make for thought. The result is 
a new life, a new being, a creature unlike the old, and 
yet one with the old. 
There is no set year for the beginning of this new 
life. Like the New Birth described in the third chap- 
ter of the Gospel of St. John, it may come without 
observation. It may come, too, like the spiritual 
regeneration, before the years of consciousness. Some 
natures are intellectually alert and vigorous from their 
very beginning. The change may occur gradually, 
stealing over the spirit with the quiet and steady pace 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
of the rising of the sun. The individual may in some 
crisis of his being find himself of a vision broader, 
of an inspiration keener, of a power greater, than of 
old. It may come suddenly. I know instances of 
this new birth that deserve to be compared with a 
cataclysm of nature, so startling, so revolutionary 
were they in process and in result. In one important 
respect such revolutions differ from the cataclysms of 
nature; for the new birth is always constructive. It 
may also be said that in certain men the intellectual 
new birth never occurs. One may never reach his 
conscious intellectual life. The flesh may permanently 
dominate the mind. The spark of the mind may be 
buried in and put out by the physical mass. That 
which is designed to be the expression of the mind and 
also the tool and the agent of the mind,—the body,— 
may usurp the functions of its proper master,—the 
mind. The spirit is lost in the flesh. But in most 
persons the intellectual life does come to its arousing, 
its enlargement and enrichment. 
Although there is no set year for this awakening, 
yet in most persons the awakening comes between the 
years of seventeen and twenty-one. It occurs in the 
college age. In the college age, that time which falls 
in the middle of the course represents the usual period 
of ripening. College officers frequently observe a 
fundamental and vital difference between the college 
Sophomore and the college Junior. The boy or girl,
-P-A-G-E-147
  
Methods and Conditions 135 
a Sophomore, is juvenile; the Sophomore boy or girl, 
become a Junior, is mature. In a few months the man 
seems to have found his soul. He has come to himself. 
He has discovered himself. He is born again. He 
lives. 
I recall a striking instance of this character. A 
man whom I shall call Mr. Angel came to college from 
a home of culture. His bearing indicated ability. The 
first two years of his course were idle years. Without 
severe work he could and did maintain a fairly respec- 
table standing as a scholar. Near the close of his 
Sophomore year he discussed the question of leaving 
college and taking up the study of music. For some 
reason or other he decided to continue. With the 
opening of the Junior year appeared a man quite dif- 
ferent from the boy who said good-bye to his class- 
mates at the close of the Sophomore year. His step 
had become more vigorous; the expression of his face 
more alert and spirited. Idleness was transformed 
into the mood of labor. Vigorous power of every sort 
was manifest. Vigor and power of every sort too be- 
came more and more manifest in the following two 
years. One could almost see the man grow from week 
to week. His conversation became larger, richer, the 
relations of his thought world-wide. At the close of 
his course he pronounced one of the more notable 
addresses ever given on the Commencement platform. 
In the week following graduation he sailed for Ger- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  136 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
many, where he spent three years in study, and at 
their end he received the doctor’s degree with special 
commendation. 
So marked an instance of the awakening of the in- 
tellectual powers is seldom seen, but the same awaken- 
ing in kind occurs in tens or hundreds of thousands of 
young men and women. 
The evidences of this change are usually not recon- 
dite. Not seldom the body suggests the change; the 
eye takes on a brighter brightness; the face becomes 
more alert. Even, at times, a new light may seem to 
be shining forth from the countenance. The bearing 
indicates increasing individuality, enlarging person- 
ality. But there are evidences more significant than 
any physical changes. 
This awakening intellect is characterized by the 
spirit of inquiry. Its mood is interrogative. This 
spirit of questioning touches the inner world of itself 
and the outer world as well. It is at once philosophic 
and scientific. Its first field of investigation is usually 
its own nature. It asks: What am I? It searches out 
the validity of its own possessions, intellectual, emo- 
tional, volitional. It asks: What is truth? and, unlike 
Pilate, it is willing to wait for an answer. It casts 
its light into the depths of the human heart seeking 
for the things which deserve loyalty or command 
affection. It forces its way into the citadel of the 
human will and begs to know the truth as to the |
-P-A-G-E-149
Methods and Conditions 137 
supreme elements of human destiny. It applies its 
question to the conscience. All that psychology con- 
veys to us about man the awakened intellect seeks 
to learn from the individual himself. 
Further evidence of this awakening nature is seen 
in the self-confidence of personality. It believes in 
itself. It is egoistic in the most worthy sense and also 
in a sense that may not be the most worthy. This self- 
confidence in himself arises from the man discovering 
in himself powers of which he had had no intimation as 
existing. He finds himself stronger, larger, richer than 
he thought. This self-confidence may be quiet or ex- 
pressive, modest or haughty. But usually it is true 
the man thinks of himself as able to know and to 
do things which once seemed impossible. He will do 
things. “Impossible” is not the word writ in his dic- 
tionary. Whatever field of investigation or endeavor 
he may choose for the dedication of his powers will 
thenceforth be wider in extent and richer in findings. 
The man of this self-confidence is not inclined to sym- 
pathize with the past. The former generations have 
not done what they ought. Their richest attainments 
and highest achievements are not absolutely either 
high or rich. Iconoclastic may become the prevail- 
ing mood, mode and agent. It is not unlikely that 
this man will seek to remove the images before which 
humanity has long worshipped. The superstitions 
which humanity has been content to embrace for so 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
138 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
many ages, the new soul would dispel; it yearns for 
diviner altars. 
This self-confidence usually takes itself very seri- 
ously. It has none of the gaiety and frivolity of the 
world. If aman has been devoting himself to keeping 
his purple very purple, and his fine linen very fine, and 
has been wont to fare sumptuously every day, he 
becomes willing to discard his old belongings. In 
long meter he sings life’s psalm, “Life is real, life is 
earnest.” He becomes conscious of responsibility and 
of his own responsibility in particular. A change 
comes to him somewhat akin to that which Donatello, 
Hawthorne’s great creation, suffered, only it is a 
change for good and for better. 
These experiences, too, are characterized by the 
belief on the part of the one having them that they 
are unique. He has never felt this way before. He 
had no idea that he ever could feel like this. He had 
no idea that such an arousing is a part of the life of 
humanity. Such light as shines upon him never shone 
before on land or sea. So solitary is he that he is 
inclined to give no intimation of his experience even 
to dearest friends. He holds this vision apart from 
all eyes. So rich is his discovery, so entrancing his 
enjoyment, so holy his responsibility, so sacred this 
communing with himself, that he believes he is en- 
riched as others have not been blessed. His experi- 
ence is unique. But though he believes this experience 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
Methods and Conditions 139 
is unique, and is known to himself alone, others see 
the change and recognize its significance. They know 
that this soul is passing through an experience which 
the best souls have passed through in the process of 
self-discovery and of self-conquest. 
If it be possible, therefore —to return to the primary 
question,—a calling for life should not be chosen until 
the new birth has set its declarations upon the nature 
of the enduring abilities of each person. The nature 
of these abilities is manifest in personal preferences. 
Personal preferences and abilities usually coincide. 
Rejections and disabilities also likewise go hand in 
hand. What one likes to do, he usually has most 
native power for doing. The native power constitutes 
or determines the motive power, and both are an indi- 
cation and prophecy of lasting preference and lasting 
performance. 
That it is the duty to follow one’s ability is plain, 
as plain as it is that it is the duty to do the best 
work to secure the richest results, to make the highest 
achievements. Such a choice represents economic effi- 
ciency, and efficient economy. 
For those, however, who must begin to support 
themselves or their families before the revelations of 
the new birth emerge, the law of the uniting of prefer- 
ence and of ability still holds. It may hold, however, 
as a less clearly obligating force. Of course, other 
causes than those belonging to the man himself may 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
140 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
determine the vocational choice,—such as reasons of 
family duty, reasons of the continuance of a business, 
—but, so far as the man himself is concerned, his 
preferences should be allowed to have great, even if 
not conclusive, weight. His preferences may still 
measure and interpret his native talent. 
It may be added that parents, considering the future 
vocation of their‘sons and daughters, are ever to exer- 
cise the virtue of intellectual discrimination and the 
grace of moral restraint for themselves. They are to 
recognize that their children have their individual 
lives to live, their individual responsibilities to bear, 
their individual rights to accept and to exercise. They 
are, therefore, never to impose their own choice upon 
their children’s determinations. The son, who likes 
his Latin grammar and hates physics, should not be 
predestined, in the parental guidance, to be a professor 
of the science of electricity. For better or for worse, 
the parents are, after a certain age (the age differing 
with different children), to keep their hands off. 
Parents of mature children may be counsellors, but 
seldom governors, more seldom rulers, never despots.

The “Project” Method 
In the earlier ages of children, in the adjustment of 
the subject of study to the student, emerges a method
-P-A-G-E-153
  
Methods and Conditions 141 
which is known as the “project” method. This method, 
however, is, by certain minds, supposed not to be 
limited to the earlier years, but to continue through- 
out the educational process. But, as at present con- 
stituted, it does belong to the earlier time. The phrase, 
the “project” method, bears an obscure name for a 
clear educational process. It is a form of interest, as 
well as of achievement. The general condition, lying 
behind and in this method, is well interpreted by an 
expositor in saying: “Heretofore a régime of coercion 
has only too often reduced our schools to aimless 
dawdling and our pupils to selfish individualists. . . . 
Wholehearted purposeful activity in a social situation 
as the typical unit of school procedure is the best 
guarantee of the utilization of the child’s native capac- 
ities now too frequently wasted. Under proper guid- 
ance purpose means efficiency, not only in reaching 
the projected end of the activity immediately at hand, 
but even more in securing from the activity the learn- 
ing which it potentially contains. Learning of all 
kinds and in its all desirable ramifications best pro- 
ceeds in proportion as wholeheartedness of purpose is 
present. With the child naturally social and with the 
skillful teacher to stimulate and guide his purposing, 
we can especially expect that kind of learning we call 
character building.”?

Method,” by William Heard Kilpatrick, p. 18.

  142 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
In further interpretation, Professor Kilpatrick has 
said: “The fundamental factors in the educative proc- 
ess... are the child and the race experience: the 
child, a bundle of impulses and potentialities; the race 
experience, the best that has come to us from the past 
incarnate in the child’s elders, incarnate in the totality 
of the child’s elders but not all of it in any one. The 
relative stress upon these two factors, as far as initiat- 
ing the educative process is concerned, is undergoing 
change. In the older point of view, still found in many 
conventional schools, the starting point in procedure 
has been first to fix the race experience in systematic 
subject-matter. The difficulty of this older way has 
been to reach the child; and its danger, accordingly, 
that of losing both child and subject-matter. For the 
race experience is preserved only as we succeed with 
the child. The other way, the way of purposeful ac- 
tivity, is to begin with the child. Its task and diffi- 
culty, then, is to include the race experience; and its 
danger, that of failing to secure the best selection of 
the race experience. . . . 
“Thus a school means children living and learning, 
with older people who embody the race experience 
present to transmit and guide—the best transmis- 
sion, perhaps the only transmission, being through 
the stimulation and guidance of child activity. The 
outcome should be older children ever growing in 
character and wisdom, increasingly able to direct
-P-A-G-E-155
  
Methods and Conditions 143 
themselves in harmony with the ever-widening and 
ever-deepening social life about them. There is thus 
no need to think of a conflict between child nature 
and subject-matter. They represent, as it were, but 
different stages of the same line of development. . . . 
“The final step among the fundamentals of this posi- 
tion is to accept the belief, apparently substantiated 
alike by science and commonsense, that the presence 
of a strong purpose on the part of the learner on the 
one hand promises the exercise of the best kind of 
activity and, on the other, furnishes the surest guar- 
antee that the proper exercise will eventuate in sound 
learning. Putting together the position here taken with 
the need for guidance, . . . we have the general state- 
ment of our position, that wholehearted purposeful 
activity proceeding under wise guidance in a social 
situation promises best both for education and for 
life, because it best identifies education with life.”* 
The advantages and disadvantages are well sum- 
marized: (1) the advantages: 
1. Tolerance of the opinions of others, open- 
mindedness and good-will. 
2. Self-reliance, i. e. ability to go and gather use- 
ful information.

6. Good fellowship and good leadership. 
7. Acquiring the power to participate in worth- 
while constructive discussion.

9. Wholehearted activity stimulated in pursuit of 
knowledge. 
10. Remarkable facility in using parliamentary pro- 
cedure as an instrument in conducting class

11. The teacher is “not dethroned.” He is in the 
center of the group as advisor and guide 
instead of dictator. 
12. Responsibility for the conduct of the work felt 
to rest on both teacher and pupils. 
And (2) the disadvantages are pointed out as: 
1. Loss of time in ground covered due to parlia- 
mentary discussion. The latter, however, felt 
to be distinctly worthwhile; a question of 
relative values. 
2. Loss of time due to needless discussion. 
3. A lack of continuous and severe mental work.
-P-A-G-E-157

4. The slower student seems to demand more defi- 
niteness in the daily assignments. 
5. Getting beyond the depths of the pupils so that 
they talk about things without clearly under- 
standing them. 
6. Certain required subject-matter slighted. 
7. Non-participation on part of some members of 
the class is greater by this method. 
8. Encourages the expression of opinions not 
founded on sufficient knowledge.* 
These diverse advantages and disadvantages may 
possibly be summed up, on the side of the difficulties 
of the introduction of the project method, in saying 
that the two chief difficulties lie in the cost and in the 
obtaining of a proper number of well-equipped teach- 
ers. But be it added that the community, in both its 
general and group relation, is willing to be taxed for 
education, only provided that the revenue thus raised 
is effectively used. It is also clear that the purpose 
of securing a proper number of good teachers repre- 
sents an aim toward which the community should 
direct its efforts. Such devotion will ultimately give 
the proper teaching force.

It is probable that the name “project” will presently 
lose its prominence. But the probability becomes a 
certainty that the essential value of this method will 
become united with the other great values of the whole 
educational process. The resulting condition will make 
for the improvement of all educational conditions and 
forces, and this improvement, in turn, will enrich the 
intellect and ethical character of man.

EDUCATION, PASSIVE, NEGATIVE, 
PART-TIME 
In the interpretation of the character of the edu- 
cation which has the highest value emerge certain 
limitations or applications. Such limitations or appli- 
cations, for my present purpose, may be called nega- 
tive. They represent that type of education which 
should not be made and cannot be made of the most 
worth. 
One of these negative forms might specifically be 
called passive education. Education represents the 
mind at work in learning, in thinking, in reasoning. 
If education be a co-operative endeavor, the mind 
of the studént is one of the co-operators. If educa- 
tion be a biological process, the mind is one of the 
vitalized and vitalizing forces, one of the fertilized 
and fertilizing powers, which is to be cultivated and 
nourished, and which also gives cultivation and nour- 
ishment. But, at the present time, there appears a 
tendency to interpret the mind as, not a co-working 
force, but as a receptive condition. It may accept 
much, but it responds slightly. It is hardly a looking- 
147 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
glass. It is a mirror only. It may reflect, but it is 
not reflective. It may hear, but it does not listen. 
It looks, but it does not see. If it hear, the waves of 
sound are prone to leave no traces. 
Two forms of passive education are evident. One 
makes its primary appeal through the ear and the 
other through the eye. 
Section 1 
The Lecture System 
The form of passive education which appeals to 
and through the ear is the system founded on and 
consisting of lectures. It represents education con- 
veyed by speech to the hearing student. It has many 
and diverse applications, and makes many and diverse 
appeals. It is more common in the undergraduate 
college or professional school. Another form relates 
to the so-called extension courses, by which knowl- 
edge is borne to the great body of the people of the 
community. Such courses are usually provided by 
the colleges or universities, or by those associated 
with the universities. They are given both on the 
campus and in halls where audiences can be easily 
and properly assembled. In New York, Philadelphia, 
and other metropolitan neighborhoods, such lectures 
have proved especially popular. The third type, more 
or less educational, represents lectures given before 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 149 
societies and clubs, upon themes at once timely and 
commanding in their interest. 
Such courses and lectures have value. Their prin- 
cipal worth lies, first, in giving information, and, 
second, in the stimulation of interest in the theme 
presented or in themes suggested. The lectures quicken 
inspiration. Even if the information conveyed be 
superficial, and even if the stimulation be transient, 
yet the information has some value and the stimula- 
tion is not to be despised. As educational forms and 
forces, however, the general and strong objections to 
them are evident. They represent the giving of intel- 
lectual food without subsequent mastication, digestion, 
or assimilation. Even if intellectual food be masti- 
cated, it is in peril of not becoming digested, and if it 
is digested, it suffers the peril of not becoming a part 
of the intellectual and moral character of the indi- 
vidual. Such offerings do not discipline discrimina- 
tion. They are not able to nourish the mood of 
considerateness. They do not train the judgment. 
If the taking of notes on lectures be required, and if 
these notes are subsequently studied with care, these 
disadvantages are somewhat removed. But be it added 
that careful note-taking is rare among the students 
of lecture-courses, and be it also said that careful note- 
taking is altogether too much neglected in college 
lecture-rooms. Careful note-taking should be empha- 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
sized as one of the more valuable exercises in edu- 
cation. 
The contrast between the worthiness or the worth- 
lessness of the lecture system and the worth of the 
tutorial system is deep and broad. In the tutorial, the 
tutor and the student come into intellectual wrestling. 
The thinking is hard, the touch stimulating, the rela- 
tion of man to man close. Wit whets wits. In the 
lecture system, dawdling, rather than attentiveness, 
prevails. I know of lecture-courses attended by a 
thousand students. In thinking of such a course one 
remembers the remark of Aristotle, that “eloquence 
never teaches.” 
With the lecture system should be contrasted the 
method of instruction known as the recitation. If the 
recitation system be a reciting only or chiefly, it is not 
a good educative tool. If it représents the memory as 
its main element, it is a bad tool, a very bad tool. The 
term recitation should be supplanted by the term con- 
ference. If the conference begin with the student tell- 
ing what he knows, both as a fact and as evidence of 
previous study, it should continue with the teacher 
and the student comparing knowledges and inferences, 
giving intimations each to the other, and weighing the 
evidences for and against every proposition considered. 
The teacher with the books, of which he is the master, 
the student also with the textbook or books of which he 
is a student, represent under most educational forms  
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 151 
the more efficient method for securing the education 
which has the highest value. It represents the tutorial 
system at its best. Such a method should supplement 
the university lecture system, brought into America 
by the minds and hands of men who, for a century, 
have received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 
German universities. With its excellences of thor- 
oughness and of ploddingness, the German system is 
not for American students the wisest or the worthiest. 
Section 2 
The Moving Picture 
A second form of passive or negative education, 
making its appeal to and through the eye, is the pic- 
ture, the moving picture, or “the movies.” In his 
“Laécoon,” Lessing says: 
“The rule is this, that succession in time is the 
province of the poet, co-existence in space that of the 
artist. To bring together into one and the same pic- 
ture two points of time necessarily remote, as Maz- 
zuoli does the rape of the Sabine women and the 
reconciliation effected by them between their husbands 
and relations; or as Titian does, representing in one 
piece the whole story of the Prodigal Son,—his disso- 
lute life, his misery, and repentance,—is an encroach- 
ment of the painter on the domain of the poet, which 
good taste can never sanction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    
152 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
“To try to present a complete picture to the reader 
by enumerating in succession several parts or things 
which in nature the eye necessarily takes in at a 
glance, is an encroachment of the poet on the domain 
of the painter, involving a great effort of the imagina- 
tion to very little purpose.”* 
This interpretation of the great philosopher is spe- 
cially germane to the “movies.” For the “movies” 
represent successions in time, rather than co-existence 
in space. They are aptly named. They do not stay. 
They move, and they move rapidly. Of course, this 
form of instruction has certain advantages. One who 
is closely associated with the whole moving picture 
movement as a leader, has given to me his interpreta- 
tion of these advantages: 
“First, it affords perhaps the most perfect medium 
for swift and vivid review of the student’s past experi- 
ence. 
“People learn new things mainly through what they 
have already learned in the past. When I was in 
Porto Rico, I remember hearing about the Carmelite 
nuns who during the Spanish war were driven out of 
their nunnery and, for the first time since their en- 
trance as young girls years before, saw the light of 
the city of San Juan. They were driven to another 
*“Tadcoon, An Essay upon the Limits of Painting and 
Poetry,” by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Translated by Ellen 
Frothingham. Roberts’ edition, p. 109.
-P-A-G-E-165
       Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 153 
shelter and one of those who took charge of them told 
me that the nuns gazed with complete indifference 
upon the monster battleships in the harbor, upon the 
street cars and railroad train. They made no com- 
ments and seemed completely dulled until the car- 
riages passed a field where a cow was grazing. The 
cow carried them back to the old familiar scenes of 
their childhood, and with one accord the nuns ex- 
claimed, pointed, and cried out, ‘There’s a cow.’ It 
would have been hopeless to start them talking about 
the warships, because those were so foreign to their 
previous experience that they called up no related 
thoughts. It was the cow, which all of them remem- 
bered, which proved the connecting link between the 
old world and the new. 
“The wise teacher seeks always to make connections 
between the new experience, which she wishes the 
child to know, and his fund of previous experiences, 
which are his old and familiar possessions. More 
quickly and vividly than can discussion or story, the 
motion picture reviews familiar experiences and so pre- 
pares the ground for new learning. 
“In the second place, the motion picture makes it 
possible to bring new interpretations of past experi- 
ence to the child. What would take a whole volume 
to describe in print may be presented in its high lights 
upon the screen in a few minutes. It is possible to 
review rapidly first one phase of experience and then  
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
another, and by making new combinations to lead the 
student to that place where he can analyze, epitomize, 
and reconstruct his experience, so that it becomes full 
of meaning. 
“Tn the third place, the motion picture offers perhaps 
the quickest and most effective substitute for real life 
which is available to the teacher. It is not life, but 
it is a good portrayal of life. It is ordinarily impos- 
sible to send a child on long journeys to foreign lands. 
The motion picture properly handled can take him 
on imaginary journeys more real than those he can 
reconstruct from textbooks. It is unwise to throw a 
child overboard in order that he may learn proper 
methods of resuscitation, and it would be useless to 
allow him to be run over by a railroad train in the 
hope that if he should survive he would learn the 
lessons of caution: For such dangerous types of learn- 
ing, the vicarious experience of the motion picture is 
a wiser tool than actual experience itself could be. 
“There are certain rules which must be followed if 
motion pictures are to be effective as teaching tools. 
In the first place, they must start the pupils thinking. 
Merely to show interesting facts or events is not 
enough. There is no use in exposing a student to 
facts unless one may be sure that the exposure results 
in the pupils catching those facts. The motion picture 
as a teaching tool must at the very start raise problems 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
       Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 155 
so appealing to the student that he keeps thinking 
about them long after the film is done. 
“In the second place, the good teaching film will 
present very few main propositions. Certainly not 
more than five, and preferably only one or two main 
points should stand out in any given film. Otherwise 
attention will be dispersed and will not be strong on 
any given point. 
“For the same reason, it is essential to avoid all un- 
necessary material. Most so-called educational films 
err by giving too much. If they show rivers, they 
give the names of the rivers; if they show orange 
groves, they give the number of trees, the total crop, 
the costs of cultivation, and so on. Most classroom 
films attempt to be pedagogic by asking numerous 
questions in the form of titles. It seems clear that’ the 
good film must be a simple film. It should contain a 
minimum of explanation and question. The problems 
it raises should be inherent in the action, rather than 
added to the action in the form of extraneous titles. 
“The good film must not answer the pupil’s ques- 
tions for him. If the student is to be entertained, he 
may be supplied with a film first raising a human 
problem, and then solving it. If the solution meets 
with his approval, the watcher is pleased and feels that 
he has had good entertainment. He is relieved from 
the necessity of thinking, and that state following 
upon questioning and disturbance is, in itself, satisfy-  
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ing. The teaching film, on the other hand, must not 
leave the student in this calm and satisfied frame of 
mind. If the solution is given him, he will not think 
about it. The film must raise the problems for him 
in such a way that he cannot help continuing to ponder 
them in his mind. It must leave its story unfinished. 
“Most essential is it that the classroom film be not 
left to stand alone. I cannot at the moment conceive 
of a teaching film so good that it might be left without 
classroom discussion. If the pupil merely watches 
and wonders, he will probably cease his mental ac- 
tivity shortly. If, however, the problems are seized 
upon by the class, discussed pro and con under the 
guidance of a skillful teacher, the thinking awakened 
by the film will go on and on to profitable brain de- 
velopment. One of the big problems in the making 
of classroom films will be that of securing adequate 
classroom discussion to surround it.” 
Like the form of education found in the lecture 
addressed to the mind through the ear, the “movies” 
do convey information through the eye. The form of 
conveyance may not be the most remunerative, but 
information to a certain degree does result. The 
“movies” also, unlike the lecture system, give recrea- 
tion. They tend to refresh tired minds and bodies, 
though this refreshment is not given under conditions 
best fitted to preserve eye-sight and other tools and 
forces of the individual’s health.   
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 157 
> as a form of passive education, But the “movies,” 
are subjected to fundamental disadvantages: 
(1) The mind is, on the whole, inactive. It receives. 
If the mind receives sensations, impressions, ideas, it 
is not able to hold them before itself. Being unable to 
hold them before itself, it cannot compare them, or 
reason about them. Being unable to reason about 
them, it cannot be properly educated by them. 
(2) The “movie” system does not represent, in its 
educational process, the law of causality. It lacks 
logic. It does not present the principles of reasoning. 
Its details fail to lead up to inductions. Neither do 
its inductions go out into deductive results. 
(8) The pictures of the “movie” system more easily 
produce emotional excitements than intellectual reac- 
tions and reflections. They stand for the story. They 
more naturally represent the startling, the sensual, the 
sensational, the irrational. They fail to embody the 
soberness, the mental integrity, the moral and rational 
considerations which constitute the strongest forces 
and most lasting movements of society. 
(4) The “movies” also fail to promote co-operation. 
The spectator sees, and sees in and for himself. There 
is no teacher to interpret, to explain, to criticize, to 
emphasize. Truths important are made, or are liable 
to be made, insignificant, and truths unimportant to 
emerge as important. The sense of proportion is 
lacking.

To both forms of passive education, therefore, the 
lecture using the ear, and the “movie” system using 
the eye, even with the advantages which they provide, 
are found serious objections of detail. But there 
are also objections serious and of a fundamental 
character. Both methods tend to give rather conceit 
of knowledge than knowledge itself. They create that 
mood which Socrates found prevailing among the men 
of Athens, of believing they knew when they did not, 
a mood to the removal of which he set himself. Both 
the lecture and the “movie” systems, be it acknowl- 
edged, are to some a gateway of knowledge, and 
through this gateway they enter and do find real 
knowledge. But to others they constitute a rest- 
house in which they are inclined to linger at their 
ease. Both forms, and especially the ‘ ‘movies,” also 
tend to strengthen those parts of human nature which 
do not need strengthening, the emotional, without pro- 
viding guidance or control, and they also fail to 
strengthen those parts which do require strengthen- 
ing, the rational, the thoughtful, the reflective.

The Limitation of Quackery 
In the limitations and applications of the principles 
of that education which has most worth, one finds
-P-A-G-E-171

conditions and forces which merit no other name than 
the name of quackery. 
Illustrations of quackery intellectual and educa- 
tional abound. I select several from the advertising 
pages of a reputable magazine. Beneath the figure of 
a man so virile that he seems almost virulent, are 
printed these words: 
Let him give you a real command of English. It will take 
only some of your spare moments at home; no repellent 
grammar-study; each lesson as clear as daylight, and inspiring 
to the highest degree. Commence now—let .......... teach 
you through his Mail Course in practical English, how to 
Enlarge your stock of words, 
Use the right word in the right place, 
Write tactful, forceful letters, advertisements, stories, 
sermons, etc., 
Become an engaging conversationalist, 
Enter good society, 
Be a man of culture, power, and influence in your 
community. 
Good English is absolutely necessary to the highest success 
in life. What material benefit is it to have good ideas if you 
can not express them adequately—if you can not make others 
see them as you do? 
We send by mail full particulars of this famous Course. No 
cost, no obligation to you—but ask for them to-day, on a post- 
card. 
A correspondence school of a Massachusetts city 
commands you to “Cultivate your mind. Develop 
your literary gifts. Master the art of self-expression. 
Make your spare time profitable. Turn your ideas 
into dollars.” In a certain degree of modesty it adds: 
     
-P-A-G-E-172
160 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
“There is no other institution or agency doing so much for 
writers, young or old. The universities recognize this, for 
over one hundred members of the English faculties of higher 
institutions are studying in our Literary Department. The 
editors recognize it, for they are constantly recommending our 
courses.” 
But educational quackery does not belong to the 
literary art only. It also has found its way into the 
training of the lawyer. It begins with the command— 
“Become a lawyer.” It follows this first command 
with the second—“Study at home.” It follows further 
with interpretations and promises: 
“Legally trained men win high positions and big success in 
business and public life. Greater opportunities now than ever. 
Be a leader. Lawyers earn 
$3,000 to $10,000 Annually. 
We guide you step by step. You can train at home during 
spare time. We prepare you for bar examination in any 
state. Money refunded according to our Guarantee Bond if 
dissatisfied. Degree of LL.B. conferred. Thousands of suc- 
cessful students enrolled. Low cost, easy terms. Fourteen- 
volume Law Library free if you enroll now. Get our valuable 
120-page ‘Law Guide’ and ‘Evidence’ books free. Send for 
them—TODAY.” 
The stream of quackery broadens as it flows. Im- 
proving the memory is a characteristic purpose. A 
prescription of this type has as its heading—“Stop 
Forgetting.” The second line is: 
“MAKE YOUR MIND A FILE—NOT A PILE” 
“Let me show you how to make your mind as systematic and 
forget-proof as a card index file. When you want to remember 
a name, place or date, must you grope in vain in a mixed-up
-P-A-G-E-173
       Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 161 
ed pile of miscellaneous knowledge? Summoned on 
any occasion to give facts and figures, does your mind become 
a blank? Be master of your mind’s infinite resources—instead 
of a victim of its disordered details. 
Knowledge is power—and memory is the basis of all knowl- 
“ I Have Helped Thousands. 
Perfect Your Memory and You Can Command What Salary 
You Will.” 
The disasters wrought by such quacks and their 
quackeries are rather fundamental to education and 
to what education represents. Their evils are the evils 
of pretense and of evasion. They lure the innocent 
and well-meaning victims away from real education. 
They create and they foster the ills and the evils which 
the Greek sophist in the time of Socrates was accused 
of promoting, and did promote. These quacks are 
counterfeiters of the intellectual currency, of thought, 
of knowledge, and of intellectual power. They are the 
educational counterparts of the financial fakirs. 
The cause of such intellectual quackery is at once 
general and particular, permanent and timely. The 
general and lasting cause is found in the quality of 
human nature which likes to get something for noth- 
ing; the hard for the easy; the more for the less; the 
most for the least. It stands for intellectual cheap 
jewelry. It represents intellectual laziness. It signi- 
fies the desire to get culture while you wait, as you 
get your clothes pressed or your boots half-soled. The 
cause has rested in humanity’s bosom since the time of  
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
Alcibiades, and apparently is to lie there still ior 
another twenty-five hundred or more years. The 
timely cause is found in the fact that there is a large 
amount of intellectual activity in the American people. 
It is an activity devoted to direct ends, and not to. 
general and purely intellectual culture. In fact, the 
larger part of humanity’s intellect as found in the 
United States is given to immediate material ends. 
Little research is pure. It is moved by an industrial 
aim. It represents, indeed, material efficiency. Out 
of this spring of intellectual energy leaps forth the 
stream of quackery. The general source of energy is 
good, or at least only one-half corrupt, and a part of 
the stream thus issuing is also good, or in part only 
pestiferous. A further cause is found in the desire to 
get on and to get up. The common idea of getting on 
and of getting up is to have a profession rather than 
a trade, to use the brain primarily rather than to work 
with the hands, to receive a salary rather than wages. 
Americans do not realize that a profession poorly fol- 
lowed is not so good as a trade well pursued, and that 
it is far better to use the hands in laying a strong 
brick wall for a home than to use the mind in making 
speeches in loose English and with looser logic, based 
on narrow premises and leading to pestiferous and~ 
disastrous conclusions. 
The education which has the most worth should 
aid in removing such quackery. For, 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 163 
First: Quackery is removed by a knowledge of the 
nature and history of the human mind. The human 
mind is among the most complex of all forces. What 
it is not is much easier to say than to tell what it is; 
and to say what it is not, is indeed difficult. The 
mind is man knowing—man thinking—man reasoning 
—man feeling, and feeling emotions of all sorts and 
conditions,—man appreciating the beautiful, the sub- 
lime,—man choosing, and choosing the right, and not 
the wrong, the wise and not the foolish, the good and 
not the evil. 
Second: A cure also would be helped on by a knowl- 
edge of the quacks themselves and of their vain 
promises. Genuine teachers are not inclined to make 
promises. Quacks abound in promises. Genuine teach- 
ers are gentle in manner, quiet in their speech. Quacks 
are noisy. Genuine teachers recognize the laws of 
mental growth and development. Quacks seek to over- 
turn law and to destroy natural principles. Genuine 
teachers embody relationships. Quacks are theatri- 
cal showmen. Genuine teachers have at heart the 
good of their pupils, they teach and live for, and sacri- 
fice themselves for, their students. Quacks have at 
heart their own profit. I would not call them the 
Judases, but I might call them the Benedict Arnolds. 
The genuine teachers are individual. Quacks admin- 
ister one remedy or a single set of remedies for all 
mental weaknesses and ills. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    
164 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
Third: An understanding of the different results of 
an education given by teachers and of one given by 
quacks aids in working a cure. “My teacher gave me 
my intellectual life” is the. common and hearty testi- 
mony of most men of thoughtfulness. ‘My teacher 
” is often taught me to see, he inspired me to think, 
heard in commendation of a teacher by the reverent 
and grateful pupil. “He opened to me the beauty of 
our literature.” “He showed me that I had stuff of 
which I should not be ashamed.” “He helped me to 
be a thoughtful man.” “He aided me in interpreting 
life and in seeing things as they are.” And what does 
the quack do? His doing is promises, assurances, the 
holding out of glorious visions, of achievements yet to 
be made. 
Section 4 
“Doing,” or the Practical 
A further negative method under which education 
labors may be called education by doing. It repre- 
sents a process the reverse of the customary. Educa- 
tion usually begins with the intellectual part of man, 
and ends, after passing through the alembic of his will, 
in executive acts. Education by doing reverses the 
process. It begins with the executive, and, after pass- 
ing through the volitional, ends with the intellectual, 
part. It might be called the practical method. For 
practice is its first step. It might also be called the
-P-A-G-E-177
      Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 165 
apprentice method. For it begins with putting the 
man at work. Four types of this method are to be 
distinguished: The first type lies in the co-operation 
of the school with the industrial plant. The learning 
of the school is reinforced by the practice of the shop, 
and the practice of the shop is made more rational by 
the study of mathematics, physics, chemistry, draw- 
ing, or other subjects, in the school. The second is 
embodied in the employer himself setting up a school 
within the walls of his own factory. The third type 
is found simply in the recommendation of the em- 
ployer, or possibly in his requirement, that each of his 
workmen shall have a certain amount of knowledge, 
but he leaves to the workmen the means and methods 
of getting this knowledge. The fourth type is appren- 
ticeship, narrow and direct. The employer concen- 
trates the attention of the new worker upon a single 
process or on one field of processes. Thus he obtains 
skill. 
Each of these four types has certain advantages. 
Each represents either a broadening or deepening of 
intellectual attention, or of the increase of executive 
power. Each of the four types is also open to a single 
and comprehensive objection, the narrowness of intel- 
lectual understanding and the limitation of power to 
a single employment, or even to a single form of this 
single employment. This objection, however, is of a 
most serious nature. For it does tend to create the       
-P-A-G-E-178
   166 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
mood which Matthew Arnold interprets in the phrase, 
m “a brazen prison!” This limitation blinds one to the      
    
     
                               
    ” “world above man’s head” and to “his soul’s horizons. 
“A world above man’s head, to let him see 
How boundless might his soul’s horizons be, 
How vast, yet of what clear transparency! 
How it were good to abide there, and breathe free; 
How fair a lot to fill 
Is left to each man still.’” 
Yet it is ever to be acknowledged that education by 
doing may give efficiency, even if efficiency of a nar- 
row form. It is also never to be denied that a liberal 
education, for minds and for wills of a certain type, 
may work harm. It does subtract time, four years 
or more, from one’s working period. It may result 
in the graduate demanding for himself a soft environ- 
ment. It may create a certain prejudice against him 
on the part of associates on the ground that he is a 
“high-brow!” In some graduates, too, who might be 
called victims of their own education, it may nourish 
a mood of arrogance and of remoteness from the ex- 
periences and duties of the common lot. It may allow 
slovenliness, even if it does not discipline accuracy. 
It may suffer slowness, and in certain instances does 
not promote the virtue of promptness. These objec- 
tions, though not inevitable and not customary, should 
be recognized. But they have far less weight than

Arnold, p. 120.   
-P-A-G-E-179
ee ee eee nee ee ne ee 
Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 167 
the disadvantage of the intellectual narrowness of a 
highly specialized education, based on doing and on 
practice. 
The worthiness or worthlessness of the education 
based on doing is to be interpreted in the light of the 
results which it is desired to secure. If one wishes to 
secure intellectual results of the broadest, deepest, 
highest, and most lasting worth, education should like- 
wise be cubical and prolonged. If one is willing to be 
content with results which are superficial and narrow, 
in time and other relations, education will normally 
be brief in time, and thin. Doing without learning, 
practice without thinking, inevitably produce effects 
transient and superficial. 
Such processes and such results find ample and defi- 
nite illustration in every field of endeavor, indus- 
trial, financial, and commercial. Banking, railroading, 
manufacturing, give examples countless and impres- 
sive. No field is perhaps more significant than that 
of the railroad. Is doing the best education for learn- 
ing and for serving the transportation system? Let 
me summon certain officers of the great systems as 
witnesses. One president says: “What seems to be 
needed at this time in young men who decide to follow 
railroad work as their career, is not so much any 
special knowledge as it is a thoroughly well-trained 
mind, which will place them in a position where, 
through their subsequent experience, they can assim-
-P-A-G-E-180
    168 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ilate knowledge and ultimately be capable of produc- 
” ing correct results.” Another says: “I am a stanch 
believer in education in its broadest sense, and I would 
infinitely rather have any young man in whom I am 
interested possessed of a college education and thrown 
upon his own resources at that time, than to have him 
start on his life’s work earlier and with a small capital 
at his command.” Another great president of a great 
system says: “My advice to a young man who desires 
to enter the railroad service would be, after he had 
finished his course at a high school, to take a course 
of three or four years at some scientific college, and 
while this would seem to put off the day when he 
would enter the railroad service, I am satisfied that 
in the end, all other things being equal, he will rise 
to a higher plane than if he had not obtained such an 
education.” ‘ 
These statements might be greatly amplified. But 
they are sufficient to warrant the conclusion that, in 
the railroad system, greatness of service demands an 
education based on the study of the great subjects. 
Smallness of service requires only smallness of edu- 
cation, the education of doing. Greatness of service 
requires the education of thought, of reasoning, of 
judgment, preceding the doing. What is true of edu- 
cation for the transportation system is just as true of 
education for any other great form of human endeavor. 
Comprehensively, it may be said that, for any form
-P-A-G-E-181
Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 169 
of business conducted in large relations, seven ele- 
ments are essential: (1) sound physical health, (2) 
noble moral character, (3) gentlemanliness, (4) ability 
to weigh evidence, to observe, to compare, to infer, to 
think; (5) in case of special education, the ability to 
apply general power of thinking to the solution of 
problems immediately presented; (6) combining all 
these powers, willingness through hard, diligent, noble 
work to apply one’s abilities in doing the duty which 
the opportunities lay upon one; (7) willingness to 
co-operate. 
Section 5 
Part-Time 
That form of education lying in practice and in 
doing has close relations to a form which has come to 
be known as part-time education. This education 
represents a contemporaneous union of both doing and 
of learning. It is a movement which belongs to the 
entire world. It is found in Australia and Germany, 
in South Africa and in Argentina. It is a movement, 
which has, under diverse origins and forms, continued 
for a century. It bears several and diverse names, 
each proper and each presenting individual phases or 
methods of the service. “Evening Classes,” “Continu- 
ation Schools,” “Mechanics’ Institutes,” “People’s Col- 
leges,” “Trade Union Colleges,” “Extension Courses,” 
‘Workers’ Educational Association,” are perhaps the
-P-A-G-E-182
170 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
more common names. They represent and constitute 
a movement conducted likewise under a vast variety 
of auspices and forms,—public, as municipal schools; 
private, as law schools; semi-private, as the Young 
Men’s Christian Association and the Young Women’s 
Christian Association. It is a movement making an 
appeal to men of a great variety of ages from the 
period of the ’teens to the sixth or seventh decade of 
life. It is a movement, too, in its pervasiveness using 
many types of different subjects of learning, going 
from the learning to speak and to write English to 
tuition in the courses of a law school, running from 
the so-called cultural subjects to highly specialized 
vocational demonstrations. It is a movement carried 
forward in the public schools, in university lecture 
halls, in laboratories and libraries, in chapels and 
churches, and in trade union assemblies. The chief 
advantage found in part-time education is that it 
serves those who have not been able or are not able 
to give full time and strength to their education. The 
reasons for such continuation, though limited, are 
manifold. But the most comprehensive reason lies 
in the primary duty of getting a living, or a better 
living, for one’s family or for one’s self. The boy of 
eighteen earning his daily bread, the man of forty, the 
head of the family whose daily bread depends on his 
own resources, find an equally forceful appeal in 
the part-time opportunity. A regular education, for-
-P-A-G-E-183
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 171 
bidden absolutely, or a regular education, delayed by 
circumstances, is in its essential values to a degree 
secured by the part-time system. It is a real educa- 
tion which is thus provided and accepted. The num- 
ber of persons who are participating in this type is 
tremendous. To-day’s statistics are not true for to- 
morrow. By leaps and by beunds do the numbers 
increase. Apparently the passion for taking advantage 
of part-time education among the peoples of the world, 
and especially among the American people, is as in- 
tense as is the eagerness for the regular education 
among those who are privileged. Never was the 
determination of all the people of the world to get 
an education so strong as at this very hour. 
The problems which this world-movement presents 
are many, diverse, compelling. 
The chief of these problems, as in every form of edu- 
cation, relates to the student. The part-time student 
is liable to come to his educational duty wearied by 
regular work, without intellectual energy or mental 
alertness. He is not able to apprehend or to ap- 
preciate the new truths set before his mind. He is, 
therefore, peculiarly liable to become irregular in 
attendance. Irregularity in attendance results in in- 
tellectual fruitlessness. The consequent and subse- 
quent conclusion, therefore, seems unworthy of the 
expenditure. A part of this problem concerns his 
study at home, outside of school and of work-hours. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
Of course, the condition of the home may make such 
study peculiarly difficult. But, in general, in this as 
in all education, its worth depends upon the labor 
which the student is able to put into it. Much, much; 
little, little! 
A second problem of part-time education, co-ordi- 
nate with the first, concerns the teacher. The teacher 
is in peril, like the student, of coming to his task ex- 
hausted in body and in mind. For him, too, the 
service may be a part-time service. He also, even at 
his very best, may fail to be an inspiring personality. 
Often he is led to accept this duty in addition to other 
work for pecuniary reasons. An empty purse rather 
than an overflowing heart or an altruistic mind per- 
suades him to undertake this service. This misfor~ 
tune of exhaustion is peculiarly sad. For part-time 
education demands the highest type, at the teacher’s 
desk, of vigorous manhood and womanhood, of intel- 
lectual and emotional alertness. 
To these two problems is to be added a third which 
lies in the lack of proper textbooks in the several 
subjects taught. These textbooks should represent 
clearness and simplicity without juvenile plainness, 
progressiveness without either slowness or undue 
swiftness, and a vision of results without visionari- 
ness. The ordinary texts do not quite fit into the 
demands of the part-time method. 
Another problem lies in the need of finding and
-P-A-G-E-185
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 173 
choosing subjects of study interesting to the student. 
The more mature students usually come with a spe- 
cific desire and plan, a desire worthy, and a plan wise. 
But the younger often enter the school door bearing 
desires without plans. The desires, too, may be born 
of superficial enthusiasms. The younger also often 
come without any desire other than simply to go to 
school. They have a wish to learn. For the mature, 
it is easy to provide proper subjects. The provision 
is quite inevitable. But for the younger, either enthu- 
siasts or desiring learners, it is necessary to find sub- 
jects which, without killing enthusiasm, do afford 
discipline, and which also regulate and reward desire. 
The fifth problem in part-time education relates to 
the student as he goes on with his studies. His prog- 
ress is not rapid, and is often slow. His patience, 
therefore, is constantly and heavily taxed. His pur- 
pose is liable to grow dim. His early earnestness is 
prone to lose its white-crested zeal. ‘“What’s the use!” 
becomes a prevailing mood. The crisis of going on 
or of stopping emerges. In such lowness of heart the 
teacher, therefore, is to become a quickening spirit,— 
to lift, to inspire, as well as to guide. Happy the 
student who is blessed with such a teacher, able thus 
to carry him on or to lead him forward unto the 
desired goal! 
The results of these several types of part-time edu- 
cation, under the severe limitations and perils which 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
beset them, are yet of rich and comprehensive worth. 
The results are of both primary and secondary value. 
One result lies in the more adequate utilization of 
the material and educational forces and conditions of 
the community. These material forces and conditions 
represent a vast outlay of money and of all communal 
forces. They stand both for public revenue as the 
result of general taxation and for personal benefi- 
cences. The demand for this type of education is 
as socially strong as it is logically inevitable. Every 
square foot of space of the educational plant, every 
pound of worth of the whole educational system, 
should be utilized. Part-time education goes a long 
distance in meeting this just and quickening demand. 
A second result is both individual and communal. 
The student extends his acquaintance with the field 
of knowledge. The whole world becomes a richer 
possession to him. He sees visions, and, it is to be 
hoped, he dreams dreams. ‘Measureless new mean- 
ings!” said a student to his teacher at the close of an 
evening course in economics. “The world is bigger 
for us than it was before!” said a member of the 
Workers’ Educational Association, at the conclusion 
of his winter’s instruction. 
The third result lies in the quickening of the mind 
of the student for still further advancement in his edu- 
cational career. He sees that the circle of the knowl- 
edge becomes bigger on both the side of what is known 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 175 
and also of what is yet to be known. He is inclined 
to adopt Sir Isaac Newton’s frequently used phrase. 
He maintains the childhood mood of wondering, a 
mood which opens new doors of vision and of power. 
As a still further result of this type of education to 
the community is the probability that from the tens 
of thousands of students of the more ordinary con- 
dition will occasionally emerge a single man or woman 
who will add largely to humanity’s knowledge or 
vitally to humanity’s power. Great men come with- 
out observation. They are like the wind: it bloweth 
where it listeth. From such a condition and force of 
education will, in the course of centuries, arise the 
greatest of the great. 
Respecting any disadvantage which might result 
from part-time education, as developing a sense of con- 
ceit, it is to be said that such a result is of infrequent 
occurrence. In any contrast drawn of its worth with 
the worth of the full-time form, it is ever to be remem- 
bered that such a contrast is natural. Of course part- 
time education is less, far less, valuable. The proper 
contrast, however, lies between the part-time educa- 
tion and no education at all. In such a contrast, the 
advantages which result are made most nobly mani- 
fest: “For part-time education that is intimately re- 
lated to concurrent part-time employment ministers 
to the same growing interest: the interest awakened 
in school is kept awake during the remainder of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
176 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
week by the experiences of the workshop or other field 
of service, and so goes on developing without inter- 
ruption. Moreover, such part-time education explains 
much that would otherwise be meaningless in the 
student’s employment; he is therefore anxious to 
obtain all that he can from his part-time teacher, and 
so gives him his concentrated attention.”* 
Americans are inclined to cut life up into two un- 
equal halves. The first half, more than half possibly 
in formative significance and less than half in the 
normal measurement of time, is given to education; 
the second to work. At the close of the first half it 
is said that education is finished, and at the beginning 
of the second half it is also said that life begins. Such 
affirmation is partly true and partly false. For life 
belongs to. the educational period, and also by taking 
on new emphases education should continue through- 
out the whole life period. 
Moreover, the interest in the continuity of educa- 
tion is vastly enhanced by making an intimate asso- 
ciation with one’s vocation. The manufacturer: of 
steel or iron would find more interest in the further 
pursuit of chemistry than in the study of Kant. The 
wholesale or retail dealer in cotton goods should find 
more interest in Mill’s “Political Economy” than in 
*“Applications of Principles,” Chapter 21 of “A System of 
Education,” from “Education and World Citizenship,” by 
James Clerk Maxwell Garnett, pp. 345-346. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  Education, Passive, Negative, Part-Time 177 
Wordsworth’s “Excursion,” or Shelley’s “Ode to the 
West Wind.” Continued education results in giv- 
ing understanding of one’s calling, and one’s calling 
quickens enthusiasm in prolonging education. 
Of course, a certain exception is evident. It is some- 
times wise or necessary for the field of continued edu- 
cation to lie outside of the field of one’s work. Thus 
the individual saves himself from undue fixedness of 
attention, attention which may result in mental ex- 
haustion or narrowness. The manufacturer of steel

RESULTS 
The results of the education having the most worth 
have been implicitly indicated on almost every pre- 
ceding page. Yet to a more specific interpretation of 
such results, attention may now be fittingly given. 
These results belong at once to the individual and to 
the community, and for both the individual and the 
community these results take on manifold forms. 
They are at once embodied in human character and 
also in human institutions. 
Section 1 
For the Individual 
For the individual, certain distinct results are spe- 
cifically manifest. They may be interpreted for the 
intellectual purpose in two classes: (1) reasonableness, 
and (2) complete-mindedness. These two types are 
more or less alike, yet in certain respects they are dis- 
tinct. 
The first result of the education which is of most 
worth to the individual is embodied in what I call 
reasonableness.

Reasonableness is the enlargement and enrichment 
of personality. It is the growth of, and from, the 
whole man. It is a quickening fire which warms the 
affections and moves the will. It is mental good man- 
ners. It is the spiritual counterpart of the laws of 
nature. It is a sort of human providence, or, at least, 
it seeks to interpret and to apply divine providence. 
It is the scholar’s tool and workshop. It is the plant 
which springs from the soil of truth and brings forth 
fruit like the seed. It moves in the air of reflection 
and contemplation. It touches life’s moralities, both 
as cause and as effect. It is a pilot for the ship of the 
will. It is the dividing difference between man and 
brute. It is the common foundation of the race. It 
is the uniting of man and of God. Without it, as 
Burke said, “There is no sound virtue.” Without it, 
civilization becomes barbarism; legislation, insanity ; 
executive government, anarchy; the church, profane 
babblings; literature, nonsensical mutterings; and life, 
a horrible nightmare. With it, all goodness is pos- 
sible; without it, all badness is certain. 
Such, in large relations, is reasonableness, and such 
are some of the works and conditions and results of 
its worth and power. 
Of the causes which militate against the value of 
reasonableness, I wish to suggest four. 
The first cause I name as preventing the growth of 
reasonableness is superficiality. That American educa-  
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
tion is superficial, the tests imposed by the War 
Boards prove. The American people are really an 
ignorant people. In his Autobiography, Roosevelt 
says that in a Civil Service examination the question 
was asked, to name five of the New England States. 
One answer was, “England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland 
and Cork.” Perhaps the jester would add that the 
answer had a large degree of truth! The American 
people have a knowledge belonging to the sixth grade 
of the public schools. Their ignorance is as great as 
their spirit of boastfulness, and this spirit, a sign of 
their provincialism, is alarmingly strong. They know 
but little thoroughly. They know much superficially. 
Matthew Arnold quotes M. Renan as saying: “ ‘The 
countries which, like the United States, have created a 
considerable popular instruction without any serious 
higher instruction, will long have to expiate this fault 
by their intellectual mediocrity, their vulgarity of 
manners, their superficial spirit, their lack of general 
intelligence.’ ” 
A second cause that militates against reasonable- 
ness is the American tendency to do things. We boast 
of ourselves as practical. We rejoice in the physically 
useful. We are apostles of the will. We pride our- 
selves as being executives and administrators. We 
are more eager, like the child, to go, than we are to

know whither and why we go. Such doing, of course, 
has its commendable side—of course it has. Let us 
give proper value to our tendency to do things. Let 
it be said, however, that such a tendency does not 
create or nourish reasonable beings. Milton, after he 
became blind, was accustomed to rise at four o’clock 
in the morning, and to listen to the reading of the 
Hebrew Scriptures. After the reading, it is said he 
contemplated. It is not necessary for us to contem- 
plate at four or five o’clock in the morning. But it is 
necessary to have more of the mood of contemplation 
throughout the day if we are to become beings more 
reasonable. 
A third cause preventing the development of reason- 
ableness is what I call emotional abundance. The 
Americans are an emotional people. The French have 
been called an emotional people. But the first days 
of August, ’14, prove that the remark is not wholly 
true. The original English stock, transferred to 
America, has been made more emotional than the 
stock itself remaining in the Mother Country. One 
cause is the climate—a climate unlike the dampness 
of the British Isles and of Northern and Central 
Europe. A further cause of our emotionalism is the 
ever-newness of life, the constant goings-on, the cease- 
less changes. That more than twenty million people, 
each day, ge to the “movies” indicates the presence  
-P-A-G-E-194
    182. What Education Has the Most Worth? 
and the demands of the emotional spirit. That spirit 
is at war with reasonableness. 
A fourth cause préventing the growth of the faculty 
of reasonableness is the love of uniformity. We 
Americans like to be alike. We abhor individualism, 
we cannot bear to be peculiar; we want to be in 
fashion. Our liking to be in the swim indicates 
that the same waters surround everybody. We shrink 
from being laughed at; and the singular person is 
usually the immediate object of ridicule. Reasonable- 
ness is primarily individualistic. It stands for the one 
eye that sees, for the one heart that feels, for the one 
conscience that appreciates, and for the one will that 
decides. Reasonableness of the one individual has 
respect for the reasonableness of other individuals; 
but it is willing to be, and must be, first, individualistic 
and personal. 
Yet more important and essential than the causes 
which militate against the progress of reasonableness, 
is the question, What are the causes which promote its 
affluence and influence? Of them I now name two. 
The first answer to be given is that reasonableness 
promotes reasonableness. Like produces like in all 
realms and zones. 
A second remark, therefore, to be made regarding 
the progress of the great virtue is that the college and 
school promote the growth of.reasonableness by the 
use of reason upon a variety of themes, through dif- 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  Results 183 
ferences of methods, and under diversity of conditions. 
The themes of study in the school and the college 
concerning the world without—nature, flower and star, 
matter, constitution, laws of growth gravitation; con- 
cerning the permanent—like mathematics—in space 
and time; concerning the changing—like nature’s 
forces; concerning the world human, man the indi- 
vidual person, man the race, man the nationalist and 
the internationalist—man the force in all planning, 
man the force in all doing, man economic, social, psy- 
chological, man the thinker;—and man, too, in rela- 
tion to the unseen, the unheard, the eternal, man and 
the Being in whom he lives and moves and has his 
being—such words and phrases open the window upon 
themes numberless, diverse, limitless. The methods of 
study, too, are as diverse as are the subjects them- 
selves. The study of a new thing, the study of a new 
science, the study of a new psychology, the study 
of mathematics, new and old—how unlike are the 
methods! The variety of method is akin, too, to the 
variety of conditions of thinking:—the conditions of 
the laboratory, the conditions of one’s own reflection, 
the conditions of one’s own individual judgments, 
colliding with the individual judgments of fellow 
students; the conditions of the inspiration of the 
book, and the inspirations of one’s own intellect and 
feeling and will. The man or woman, self-educated, 
is educated, or is liable to be educated, by one method
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
and under one condition. The food of his mind is 
prepared in one mental metal and is served in a single 
refectory. His is not the well-balanced ration. The 
student of the schools is made reasonable by a fitting 
proportion of the nourishments served under a just 
variety of conditions, and through a proper diversity 
of methods. 
The second general result of education which has 
the most worth for the individual is found in what I 
call complete-mindedness. 
Izaak Walton used parts of twenty-five years in 
writing his “Compleat Angler.” At the close, he would 
have been the last to say that, even then, was the 
“Compleat Angler” complete, though it be “full of 
art, baits, lines and hooks.” The science and the art 
of the complete mind is at least as complex as the 
science and the art of angling. Though no work is 
ever made full and finished, yet the beginning of, and 
the progress in it, have peculiar value. The chief 
problem is what are the forces and faculties which 
form the mind which can be described as complete? 
With this problem is joined the problem of the methods 
by which these forces are working to achieve their 
consummate purpose. Even though the purpose be 
never fully won, the continuation and direction should 
be observed, measured, interpreted. Even, moreover, 
though tools and symbols for the making of such com- 
pleteness—books, libraries, laboratories, curricula, per-
-P-A-G-E-197
  Results 185 
sonalities—abound, it is ever to be recognized that the 
achievement is only approximate. 
Complete-mindedness is a result of education of the 
highest value. For, with it or without it, rises or falls 
civilization. With it or without it, rises or falls much 
or all of the Hellenic part which forms the most deli- 
cate and highly wrought elements of our social culture. 
Without such a mind, either in possession or in poten- 
tiality, barbarism rules, the Philistine desecrates our 
shrines, Egyptian plagues afflict the chosen people. 
Macaulay’s “New Zealander” indeed sits on London 
Bridge, musing over the nation’s fallen greatness. 
Even Schopenhauer says, speaking of another and 
narrower cause, “Farewell, humanity! Farewell, noble 
taste and high thinking!’ 
For securing complete-mindedness, I want now to 
suggest two methods. 
The first aid in securing complete-mindedness is 
the realization of the need. The student, and every 
other man, is to feel the want of such a mind. He is 
to desire it as Bishop Butler desired truth, or as Glad- 
stone, a devoted student of the great Bishop himself, 
came to desire it in the second half of his career at 
Oxford. The search for such a mind should be like 
the patriot’s zeal and the lover’s passion. 
A second method of getting the complete mind lies 
«“Fssay on the Study of Latin,” by Schopenhauer. Trans- 
lated by T. Bailey Saunders, p. 31.
-P-A-G-E-198
186 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
in association with men who also desire or who already 
possess that great gift or achievement. Such associa- 
tion determined to a large degree the unique intellec- 
tual and ethical power of John Stuart Mill. For Mill’s 
father, himself able, had among his friends the ablest 
men, like Grote and John Austin. Young Mill, even 
as a boy, found stimulus in such companionship. Writ- 
ing of Grote, John Stuart Mill says: “Him I often 
visited, and my conversations with him on political, 
moral, and philosophical subjects gave me, in addition 
to much valuable instruction, all the pleasure and 
benefit of sympathetic communion with a man of the 
high intellectual and moral eminence which his life 
and writings have since manifested to the world.’’® 
Such a method stirs, moves and directs the stagnant 
intellectual back-waters into swift currents. The 
method is far less common than ought to prevail. The 
reason for the lack lies in the absence of the quicken- 
ing spirit. The need still exists that the spirit of some 
God shall move upon the face of the waters, and the 
spirit is not easily created. Thinking and thought- 
ful teachers make thinking students and thoughtful 
scholars; vital teachers vital students. 
Complete-mindedness may be called a form of per- 
sonal resource, or of personal wealth. For a result 
of education is self-enrichment. It is the riches of 
great thoughts and of great thinking. “Give me a

  Results 187 
great thought that I may lift myself with it,” said 
Jean Paul. “If you have a mind, use it. It is the 
most interesting thing,” said Bagehot. It may be 
added that this self-enrichment does not belong to 
the realm of thought only. It is found also in the 
domains of feeling. For, as says Pascal, “The heart 
has its reasons of which the reason knows not.” Most 
people live in their feelings rather than in their intel- 
lects. The educated man, however, should not refrain 
from living in his heart, as well as in his mind. The 
heart contains the issues of life. 
A result of the education which has the most worth 
is not, however, confined to the intellect, or to the 
feeling, of the individual. It belongs as well to him 
as a willing agent. “Character,” says Mill, “is a com- 
pletely finished will.” A perfect character is a per- 
fectly finished will, guided by a perfectly finished 
intellect, inspired by a perfectly finished heart. Unto 
such a fruitage education does grow. 
One of the primary methods of realizing such a 
perfectly finished will is drawn from the sphere of the 
intellect itself. It represents hard thinking, thinking 
hard in its intensity, and no less hard in its patience 
  and lengthiness. Sir Edmund Gosse has, in a happy 
paragraph, interpreted an experience in his young life. 
He says he spent hours in a small room making imita- 
tions of papers, read by his father before the Linnean 
Society: “My labours failed to make me a zoologist,
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
and the multitude of my designs and my descriptions 
have left me helplessly ignorant of the anatomy of a 
sea-anemone. Yet I cannot look upon the mental 
discipline as useless. It taught me to concentrate my 
attention. .. . Moreover, it gave me the habit of 
going on with any piece of work I had in hand, not 
flagging because the interest or picturesqueness of the 
theme had declined, but pushing forth towards a defi- 
nite goal, well foreseen and limited beforehand. For 
almost any intellectual employment in later life, it 
seems to me that this discipline was valuable. I am, 
however, not the less conscious how ludicrous was the 
mode in which, in my tenth year, I obtained it.’’* 
Jacobi, too, the mathematician, is reported to have 
said: “‘It must not be supposed that it is to a gift of 
Nature that I owe such mathematical power as I 
possess. No, it has come by hard work, hard work. 
Not mere industry, but brain-splitting thinking— 
hard work; hard work that has often endangered my 
health.’ 5 
A second method of getting a will which represents 
one of the happy results of the best education, lies in 
acting on the intellectual understanding and emotional 
approbation of a certain condition of service. “Every 
time a resolve or a fine glow of feeling evaporates

without bearing practical fruit is worse than a chance 
lost; it works so as positively to hinder future resolu- 
tions and emotions from taking the normal path of 
discharge. There is no more contemptible type of 
human character than that of the nerveless senti- 
mentalist and dreamer, who spends his life in a welter- 
ing sea of sensibility and emotion, but who never does 
a manly concrete deed. Rousseau, inflaming all the 
mothers of France, by his eloquence, to follow Nature 
and nurse their babies themselves, while he sends his 
own children to the foundling hospital, is the classical 
example of what I mean.”° 
The will exercises and reacts upon intellect and feel- 
ing which have guided and inspired it. Thus the three 
forces co-work in making the perfect character. 
The third method of securing the reward for the 
individual of the highest education lies in the clear 
understanding of the nature of the decisions which the 
man as a willing agent makes. Of such decisions 
James points out several types. The first is the 
reasonable type. It is the type which is based on the 
consideration of the evidence for and against conclu- 
sions. The second type may be called the unreason- 
able one. It is a form founded either on exterior 
circumstances which may be dimly or clearly per- 
®“The Principles of Psychology,” by William James, Vol. I,

-P-A-G-E-202
  190 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
ceived, or on certain subjective moods which are found 
on the margin dividing the conscious from the uncon- 
scious life. The third type is described by the epithet 
emotional. This part may be either joyous and exul- 
tant, or sad and depressive. This form is the heart 
acting immediately and powerfully on the will. The 
fourth type is called the personal. The whole charac- 
ter throws itself into decisions. It seems to approach 
that state of freedom which the old philosophers 
allotted to it, and most remote from the condition 
which Jonathan Edwards and his followers called the 
“greatest apparent good.” 
Such understandings, appreciations, and efforts, tend 
to create and to develop in the individual a control 
and a government of self which are of the highest 
worth. 
The man of such a will, thus guided, thus reinforced, 
we call the good man. In all the manifold and diverse 
definitions of the good man, certain interpretations 
are evident. An ethical element is, of course, included 
in the meaning of the adjective. Goodness embraces 
the cardinal virtues, and possibly also the cardinal 
graces. The man possessing such a will is just, 
prudent, temperate, considerate of others. Such a 
will means the absence of the vindictive spirit, of 
blind resentment, and of the undue love of the sensual, 
above intellectual, pleasures. It means the control of
-P-A-G-E-203
Results 191 
appetite. It means the choice of the sentiments of 
gratitude, of generosity and of fine and noble humility. 
It represents fitness to environment, as well as the 
power to improve environment. Negatively, it stands 
for unwillingness to do harm, to work damage, to pro- 
mote disaster. Positively, it stands for aggressiveness 
in performing the act that is called right, or in living 
the life that is called good. It includes self-direction 
on the part of the individual. It embraces a sacrifice 
of the lesser to the greater, of the narrower to the 
broader, of the lower to the higher, of the transient to 
the lasting, of self to the greater well-being. The 
person who is good is he who does his duty. His con- 
cept of duty may be unlike that of another. For 
duty has a diverse content. One may regard duty, in 
its origin, as an instinct, another as an intuition, an- 
other as arising from circumstances, and yet another 
may find it in a practical process. With Martineau 
or with Hobbes, with T. H. Green or with Herbert 
Spencer, with Adam Smith or with Kant, with Locke 
or with Hegel, one may have his own sympathetic 
agreement. But one will find that the individual who 
can be called good represents the worthiest results of 
the education which has the most worth. Yet, beneath 
all these differences, he will also discover a significant 
and impressive agreement in fundamental principles. 
He will find Kant’s dictum that the conduct of the

individual should be such that it could be properly 
made a universal practice is in sympathy with the 
theory of Mill and of the utilitarians, that the best 
education results in the greatest good to the greatest 
number. 
Such results of the education of the most worth to 
the individual in the field of morals are intimately 
associated with not unlike results in the field of 
religion. In this respect, definition is of primary 
importance. The term religion is used, as has been 
already intimated, in a broad meaning. It is made 
to stand for man’s relation to ultimate being. The 
optimist or the pessimist may make the phrase more 
definite, and affirm that religion has relations to ulti- 
mate good or to ultimate evil. Without bringing in 
any such subsidiary notion, one is safe in making 
ultimate being to stand for the God to whom man 
holds. relations, and whose relations to that God con- 
stitute his religion. The right relation of man to that 
being, whether that being be interpreted as personal 
or impersonal, represents a religion of the highest 
value. It is easy to declaim on the value of religion 
as among the highest values of mankind. I content 
myself with repeating what three men who are, least 
of all, declaimers, say. According to William James, 
the characteristics of the religious life are the beliefs: 
“1. That the visible world is part of a more spiritual 
universe from which it draws its chief significance;
-P-A-G-E-205
  
Results 193 
“2. That union or harmonious relation with that 
higher universe is our true end; 
“3. That prayer or inner communion with the spirit 
thereof—be that spirit ‘God’ or ‘law’—is a process 
wherein work is really done, and spiritual energy flows 
in and produces effects, psychological or material, 
within the phenomenal world. 
“Religion includes also the following psychological 
characteristics: 
“4, A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, 
and takes the form either of lyrical enchantment or of 
appeal to earnestness and heroism. 
“5, An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, 
and, in relation to others, a preponderance of loving 
affections.”’® 
James also says: “God is the natural appellation, 
for us Christians at least, for the supreme reality, so 
I will call this higher part of the universe by the name 
of God. We and God have business with each other; 
and in opening ourselves to his influence our deepest 
destiny is fulfilled. The universe, at those parts of 
it which our personal being constitutes, takes a turn 
genuinely for the worse or for the better in proportion 
as each one of us fulfills or evades God’s demands.”®

° Ibid., pp. 516-517,  
-P-A-G-E-206
  194 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
The same interpretation is offered by John Caird, 
in his Philosophy of Religion, in saying: 
“Tt may be said to be the essential characteristic of 
religion as contrasted with morality, that it changes 
aspiration into fruition, anticipation into realization; 
that instead of leaving man in the interminable pur- 
suit of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the actual 
partaker of a divine or infinite life. Whether we view 
religion from the human side or the divine—as the 
surrender of the soul to God, or as the life of God in 
the soul—in either aspect it is of its very essence that 
the Infinite has ceased to be a far-off vision, and has 
become a present reality. The very first pulsation of 
the spiritual life, when we rightly apprehend its sig- 
nificance, is the indication that the division between 
the Spirit and its object has vanished, that the ideal 
has become real, that the finite has reached its goal 
and become suffused with the presence and life of the 
Infinite. . . . The position of the man who has entered 
on the religious life is that evil, error, imperfection, 
do not really belong to him: they are excrescences 
which have no organic relation to his true nature: 
they are already virtually, as they will be actually, 
suppressed and annulled, and in the very process of 
being annulled they become the means of spiritual 
progress. Though he is not exempt from temptation 
and conflict, [yet] in that inner sphere in which his 
true life lies, the struggle is over, the victory already
-P-A-G-E-207
  Results 195 
achieved. It is not a finite but an infinite life which 
the spirit lives. Every pulse-beat of its [existence] 
is the expression and realization of the life of God.”"° 
Among the several last words of an autobiographic 
character which Frederic Harrison wrote are these: 
“We have suffered our religion to slide from us, and 
in effect our age has no abiding faith in any 
religion at all. The urgent task of our time is to 
recover a religious faith as a basis of life both personal 
and social.” 
On the basis, therefore, of such testimonies and 
interpretations, it is clear that one of the highest, and 
some would say the highest, values of education is 
found in the religious life of the individual. 
Section 2 
For the Community 
The individual is a unit. The community is many. 
It is composed of individuals. As a chemical com- 
pound may be something other than the different 
elements making it, so the community is a condition 
or a force unlike the separate individualities consti- 
tuting it. It is a new creation, and as a new creation, 
it should be considered.

  196 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
The result of the education of the highest worth to 
the community, either local or general, forms one of 
the broadest of all social and educational questions. 
Two results are, however, preeminent. I shall call 
them (1) a sense of relationship and (2) capacity for 
self-realization through self-development. 
The number and variety of relations at once con- 
stitute and measure civilization. As the number in- 
creases and the variety enlarges, man becomes more 
civilized. The individual and the group, be the group 
itself large or small, is or should be interpreted in 
terms of many-sidedness. To interpret the factors of 
the relations of human society would, in their simple 
statement, fill volumes. The significance of such an 
interpretation is made evident by the contrast with a 
society which is still savage. The Australian black 
fellow, or black boy, as he is called on the Western 
side of the great island, has been interpreted as the 
most degraded of all aboriginal tribes. It is certain 
that none are more degraded. He is equally without 
a past or a future. He has no permanent home. His 
family relationships are a union indifferent to conjugal 
duties qualified by the barbarous slavery of the wife. 
His government, if government it can be called, is the 
lowest tribal organization. His intellectual qualities 
are below the instincts of the bird which he kills with 
boomerang, and whose flesh he eats without cooking, 
His sense of shame is largely lacking. His sense of 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  Results 197 
religion is a low form of belief in a spirit good and 
a spirit bad. His sense of property is limited to 
weapons, such as knives or a few small articles which 
his wife, the burden-bearer, may carry on her back. 
His ignorance is so great that he fails to recognize it. 
He is a naked wanderer in the forests or deserts of 
his lonely land. The only virtue he seems to possess 
is the negative one that he is not a cannibal. It is 
superfluous to draw out the contrast between such a 
being and a civilized man in whom, for generations, 
the effects of civilization seen in its education, have 
been incorporated. 
Each form and factor of education add to the 
number and to the variety of the relations which a 
civilized community represents. Man begins with a 
sense of number, and he proceeds through the succes- 
sive processes or methods of counting, both as a tool 
and as learning, with an ever increasing sense of the 
infinities. He learns the certainty of methodical 
reasoning and, by inference, the doubtfulness of that 
reasoning which is not methodical. History restores 
to him the past in constantly enriching terms, bearing 
to him lessons of the new duties of the complex 
present. Literature incarnates the best that man has 
thought, the holiest that man has felt, the noblest 
_and the most precious that man has willed, both as 
achievement and as prophecy. Political science has 
been to him a sort of interpretation of the government
-P-A-G-E-210
  
198 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
of which he is either agent, co-operator, or victim. 
Economics has given him a sense of the relationships 
of men in respect to material values, and also in 
respect to the great laws which these relations uncon- 
sciously embody, and which he almost equally uncon- 
sciously obeys. Philosophy, psychology, and _ logic, 
read to him his own personal life, teaching him what 
he is to learn, in order to make learning at once an 
unconscious part of his own being, and to use it as 
a standard for the interpretation of all men. The 
sciences of nature at once paint pictures for his imagi- 
nation and lay down laws, both fundamental and 
inevitable, which control the infinitely small atom 
contained in the microscopic circle, and also the 
infinite bodies of the sky, moving in their telescopic 
orbits. The classics and the newer humanities, archi- 
tecture and astronomy, eugenics, euthenics, all the 
arts and all the sciences of the whole educational 
process, are joined together to give to man many- 
sidedness. His relations are numberless and of a 
variety which the reason cannot comprehend. The 
worth of such relations it is likewise impossible even 
to apprehend. Their interpretation constitutes the 
function of the poet, of the philosopher and of the 
prophet, rather than the duty of the single educational 
interpreter. 
The many-sided relationship, moreover, which edu- 
cation creates and nourishes through another form of

culture should not pass without notice. This element 
includes the variety of friendships which education 
cultivates. In such friendships may be embraced the 
educational values of discussions regarding current 
questions, political, literary, civil, industrial, financial. 
One should also not fail to mention that the impres- 
siveness of great architecture and of great historic 
scenes and movements represent precious educational 
forces. A leading English statesman I once asked 
regarding the chief element in Oxford as constituting 
its influence over him. His answer was, “Not the 
teacher, but Oxford itself.” The recent Royal Com- 
mission on Oxford and Cambridge has interpreted in 
its report the significance of these values: “In the 
student democracy of Oxford and Cambridge, mem- 
bers of ali classes and students of all subjects mix in 
the Colleges on terms of perfect social equality and 
close intellectual companionship. The frank and 
friendly relation with the teachers, who devote so great 
a part of their time to personal instruction, is another 
element in the life of the student. The beauty of the 
ancient buildings, devoted from time immemorial to 
purposes of thought and learning, and their historical 
associations with so many great men, help to create an 
atmosphere favourable to disinterested intellectual 
life. We understand that of recent years the intellec- 
tual activity among the body of undergraduates has 
been very remarkable; among its features are a wide-

spread interest in social questions, an increase in soci- 
eties for discussion, speculation and study, and for 
literature, music, and the drama, and an increasing 
connection with many activities of the outside world. 
If in some cases these unduly interrupt work, the edu- 
cational advantages on the whole more than counter- 
balance the disadvantages; a many-sided preparation 
for the world into which the students are about to 
enter is constantly going on under favourable con- 
ditions.”” 
A further communal result of education of highest 
value lies in what I have called self-realization. Self- 
realization is the gaining by the community of its 
worthiest soul. This result is reached through self- 
development, and the end of such development is never 
less than perfection. The fact and force of self-de- 
velopment on which Aristotle founded his philosophy 
form one of the most precious results of education. 
It is a result, however, which itself becomes a method 
and means of self-realization and of communal per- 
fection. The process of self-development is a step 
toward self-realization and consequent perfection. As 
a result of education, self-development bears three 
marks: First: It is unconscious. It is a growth, and 
like all growths it is not felt, or heard, or seen. It bears

Majesty, 1922, Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge 
Universities, p. 43, paragraph 30.

Results 201 
no personal sensual tests. Its results are most mani- 
fest, but the growth itself cometh not with observation. 
Second: The growth is a purpose indefinite. It is 
rather a feeling than a seeing, representing rather a 
tendency than a movement, rather a policy than a 
proposition, rather a wish than a will. It is, neverthe- 
less, real, positive, powerful. Third: Self-develop- 
ment, moving toward self-realization and perfection, 
gives itself to an ever lifting ideal. Each good reached 
points the way to a good higher and further on, yet 
to be reached. It is a flying goal which education 
gives to man. It is apparently an indefinite process. 
More points the way to more: the highest of today 
prophesies a yet higher of tomorrow. Plato’s ‘““Repub- 
lic” prepares the way for a form of government yet 
more complete, even if it dwell in his realm of the 
Idea. St. John’s apocalypse promises yet another 
heaven more heavenly. St. Augustine’s “City” builds 
a vision yet more divine. More’s “Utopia” gives 
assurance of a condition yet more utopian. 
The results of education are also national. Each 
people has its own system. It is also international. 
For zach people gives to and receives from every other. 
It is racial. Each race of humanity preserves its own 
ideals, follows its own methods, conserves or uses its 
own particular forces. It is also interracial. No race 
can exist apart from any other. Atmospheres leap 
over or penetrate walls.

Education is a force universal to man, unending in 
human experience: and ever vitalizing. It gives to the 
' whole community, either local or general, a realization 
of its best present powers, and also prophesies a per- 
fection which leads on and on, unto a perfection 
becoming yet more perfect in the measureless infinities.

Institutions 
Society establishes itself in institutions. Institu- 
tions are the pool into which the forces and movements 
of civilization flow, and whence also go forth other 
forces and movements. Institutions are the statical 
results of dynamic forces which themselves create yet 
other powers. They have their origin in the instincts 
of man. They are nourished by his thinking, enriched 
by his emotions, and are constituted, more often un- 
consciously than consciously, by his will. Though 
serving individuals, they are not individual, and 
though benefiting individuals much, they benefit the 
race and the races more. They represent among men 
what the science of induction stands for in logic. They 
combine and unite into a single organism, or principle, 
or law, a multitude of truths, of facts, of suggestions 
which, however insignificant in themselves, become of 
unmeasured import when joined together. Joined to- 
gether, these institutions provide laws and methods 
for serving mankind, to save it from errors of judg-

ment, from wanderings out of the pathway of duty, 
and, in a word, to serve its highest welfare. To insti- 
tutions the education which is of highest value has 
peculiar relations, in both cause and result. 
The institutions which are of fundamental value to 
humanity are, first, the family; second, property; 
third, the church, and, fourth, the state. To each of 
these institutions, education makes distinct contri- 
butions. 
(a) The Family 
The most important of these institutions is the 
family. It is an historical unit. Marriage is its foun- 
dation. Whether marriage began in the capture, or 
the purchase, of women as wives, according to current 
theories, or whether the family was at first polygamous 
or polyandrous, as do also teach current theories, it is 
clear that it was only through a long and hard struggle 
that the monogamous family was finally achieved. 
The family is also a natural unit. It seems to be the 
best method yet discovered for the continuation of the 
race. It is the nurse, and stands for the nurture, of 
little children with which each generation begins, and 
who, having become mature, transmit life to the gen- 
eration following. It is a social unit. The individual 
family is one with other families, also units to which 
it holds relations. It is further a legal unit. In formal 
ways, as well as informal, the law, either customary 
 
-P-A-G-E-216

or statute, constitutes the family. It is also, at least 
to a degree, a religious unit. For it touches relations 
apparently nothing less than infinite in time and space. 
It is indeed a national unit. For the conditions, forms, 
methods, forces, for its creation and perpetuation, are 
different among different peoples. It is more, and 
lastly, a timely unit, by which I mean that its poten- 
cies, and perils, differ in the different generations of 
men. 
This unit is being destroyed by divorce. But divorce 
itself, as a destructive instrument, is composed of 
other forces equally anti-social. Among these forces 
are the growth of individualism, the secularization of 
marriage, and the changes in the social and political 
condition of women. As Frederic Harrison has said: 
“Democracy has affected not only social and political 
ideals, but domestic ideals in subtle and indirect ways. 
It has suggested new conceptions of family life and 
family duty. Our old ideas about the sanctity of 
the family, of the sacred responsibilities of wife, 
mother, and daughter, of their relation to husband, 
father, and son, and of each to each,—all are under- 
going a silent loosening and weakening process. The 
last word of Democracy is, ‘every man, woman, and 
child for himself, herself, and itself.’ ”’*

moting the integrity of the family is seen, first, in the 
teaching that the quality of the home is of primary 
worth. It is to be remembered that the quality of 
the family, or the quality of the individual members 
thereof, is important, quite as important as the size 
of the family. Two opposing waves are beating upon 
the institution of the home. One is the demand for 
families of general culture and social worth. This 
demand is usually made of the family Anglo-Saxon, 
and with such a demand is implied a family of small 
size. The contrast is drawn between the few children 
of the Anglo-Saxon, and the many children of the 
home of the races of southeastern Europe. One wave 
sometimes bears the name of birth-control, a method 
or conclusion not designed to touch chiefly the Anglo- 
Saxon family, but the family which is inclined to 
accept children to a number larger than it can care 
for. In the midst of these difficulties the only guiding 
principle is that the quality of the family should be 
of the highest, even if the numbers are not of the 
largest. Let the children be many, or let the children 
be few, let the home be elaborate, or let the home be 
simple, let the family be wealthy, or let the family be 
poor, but let the type of life be high. Let the maternal 
love be wise as well as affectionate, and the paternal 
power be affectionate as well as wise. Let the lasting, 
fundamental, social principles of the noble quality of 
the family be interpreted, accepted, obeyed.

Second: Education should also emphasize the fact 
of the significance of the family as a social unit. It is 
fundamental to the human order. It is the most sig- 
nificant milestone in the progress of humanity from 
barbarism to civilization. 
Third: Education should also emphasize the worth 
of the influence of the training and the culture of 
women themselves as the wives and mothers in the 
home. 
Such education aids the institution of the family in 
restraining women, who should not become wives, from 
entering into the conjugal relationship. For educated 
women have many methods of making their contribu- 
tions to human well-being. Of these methods, mar- 
riage is only one doorway. If women, therefore, see 
fit not to pass through this doorway they do not suffer 
limitations which were formerly imposed. A woman 
with an education of most worth is free in her choice, 
as well as free in her mind. Education also gives sup- 
port to the family in offering assurance of the fitness 
of the contracting parties to live together as husband 
and wife. The woman graduating from college is of 
the age of twenty-two years. The emotional stage of 
the ’teens has ended. Maturity has been disciplined 
by study, as well as by the passing of time. To 
woman, as to man, the significance of marriage has 
been made more clear by education. Furthermore, the 
educated woman is able to make a richer contribution
-P-A-G-E-219

to the happiness of the home, to its worthiness and 
enlarging influence. She creates higher standards. 
She nourishes happier atmospheres. She promotes 
wiser understandings. She brings a mind more ana- 
lytical to differentiate the complexities and a will 
stronger to solve the perplexities of life. She offers 
a better disciplined heart to carry the burdens, to give 
and to receive the enrichments, of the home. The 
higher education of women is to offer to the family of 
the future a dignity more worthy, a graciousness more 
charming, an efficiency greater in its many-sidedness, 
a refinement more appreciative in its delicacy and 
power, an altruism more understanding of personali- 
ties and of conditions, an adjustment of the rights and 
the duties of all more fitting —duties and rights which 
breathe into the atmosphere of the home a spirit more 
pervading, more permanent and more divine than 
humanity has yet known. 
(b) Property 
It is fitting that the consideration of the results of 
the best education to the family should precede a dis- 
cussion of the relation of education to the institution 
of property. For the two institutions have logical 
relation. It is probable, though not certain, that the 
family preceded property as a social institution. Both 
are, however, involved in historic, or pre-historic, ob- 
scurity. When, where, under what conditions, either 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
the family or the idea of property arose still defies 
both the anthropologist and the archeologist. It is, 
however, not so obscure but that it may be said both 
arose at an early period in the history of mankind. It 
is also probable, though not certain, that the institu- 
tion of property is vitally connected with the family 
as a historic institution. The first ownership of things 
may have been a domestic ownership. It is also 
significant in the present law, both common and 
statute, that property is, in no small degree, of concern 
to the family and not simply to the individuals who 
compose the family. The methods of inheritance illus- 
trate the current facts. Present procedure is vitally 
related to a possible custom of early historic society. 
It would be difficult to overestimate the importance 
of the institution of property. For it is, first, a sort 
of outward ego of society itself which continues from 
generation to generation, flowing on as ceaselessly as 
a river, its individual parts changing, but its identity 
“continuing. And, secondly, with this continuity also 
goes an enlargement of its volume. For the increase 
in the property of the world, from the fabled age of 
antiquity to the present, is to be measured only by the 
standards of the imagination. 
Several theories of the present holding of property 
abound. The chief ones are four in number, which, 
however, can be easily reduced to two. Of the four, 
one method is hardly a theory of property. For
-P-A-G-E-221
  Results 209 
it at once abolishes the institution. It represents a 
pretty pure communism. It takes on many forms, 
romantic as found in Plato’s “Republic;” national as 
interpreting that many objects belong to all, like the 
birds or the fishes; religious as constituted in the early 
church and in many sporadic endeavors of the last 
nineteen hundred years. A second theory, though 
often erroneously associated with communism, is not 
practically unlike communism. It may be called 
socialistic. If, under communism, property is a con- 
cern of all, under socialism, property is held in trust 
as for all. In the first-named theory, property is 
owned in common; in the second, property is assigned 
under a collective law and order. The third theory 
is the theory of labor, to wit, that work gives: the 
right to ownership. The fourth represents the indi- 
vidualistic theory, that property is the right of the 
individual person. 
These four theories represent, as I have intimated, 
two interpretations. First, that property belongs to 
the person in his individualistic capacity, and to him 
alone, and, secondly, that property represents the soli- 
darity of society, and in that society its ownership is 
vested. These two interpretations represent the indi- 
vidualistic and the community conception. With them 
also should be linked, as was done by Aristotle, the 
old and ever new distinction of property for use and 
property for power.

210 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
The relation of the education of most worth to this 
pregnant question of the institution of property is 
two-fold. Education should offer to the interpretation 
of the complex and pregnant problem of property: 
first, a mind acquainted with the historical nature of 
the problem. For by most this problem is interpreted 
as a wholly new one. But it has a history going back 
as far as human annals go. With this historical 
appreciation should be associated a mind broadly 
comprehensive of all present facts, economic, social, 
governmental, touching ownership. 
Secondly, to the consideration of the problem of 
property should be brought an intellectual power to 
weigh evidence accurately and to reason logically. In 
this consideration, the power of analysis of complex 
conditions is of absolutely primary worth. The sep- 
aration of the elements of so complex and perplexing 
a condition represents a chief power and necessary 
process. Accuracy, observation, judgment, are quali- 
ties required in a mind which the best education of- 
fers for attempting the solution of this most serious 
problem. 
With these intellectual qualities should go along a 
moral nature in the individual of the noblest import. 
All owners of property, as all men, can be easily 
divided into two classes: those who consider rights of 
first importance, and those who consider duties of first 
importance. The ancient Romans belonged to the first
-P-A-G-E-223
  Results 211 
class. The moral nature of the individuals whom edu- 
sation seeks to prepare for wisely interpreting the idea 
of property, suggests the second class. Individuals, 
understanding the fact of obligation, will themselves 
the more fittingly arouse society unto a like attitude 
and mood. This moral nature, quickened and quicken- 
ing, should be sympathetic without becoming dis- 
sipated, altruistic without losing its own integrity 
and identity, deep without narrowness, high without 
visionariness or cloudiness of concept, conservative 
without being reactionary, progressive without radical- 
ism, inspiring a confidence in its own honesty, sin- 
cerity and genuineness without throwing a cloud of 
doubt on the intellectua! conceptions and reasoned 
judgment of its possessors. If the high moral nature 
should be accompanied with a sense of relationship to 
the great religious forces, the value of the moral influ- 
ence would be vastly enhanced. For divine sanctions 
have peculiar worth and quickening power in the re- 
gard for and use of property. As a living ecclesiastic 
and preacher has said: “Back to God all rights run. 
Back in Him, the ultimate Creator, producing and sus- 
taining and justifying every capacity and energy that 
His will has set in action, all ownership stands. All 
claims are made by Him, through Him, to Him. His 
righteousness is the bond of all human fellowship. 
And this is so, just because property in outward goods 
is but the outcome of personality; and all human per-
-P-A-G-E-224
ata a a a a

sonality is the issue and image of the personality of 
God. In the Divine Fellowship in which God realizes 
Himself lies the source and justification of every fel- 
lowship into which man can enter. Man’s authority 
to say of anything, ‘That is mine,’ rests, finally, on 
his power to say, ‘I am God’s.’’”4 
For the institution of property has close relationship 
with the doctrine of capitalism, and this doctrine has 
vital association with industrial and social problems. 
These problems are the most critical of modern times. 
Therefore, the education of the highest worth, in seek- 
ing to interpret the institution of property, may offer 
aid in the answering of questions immediate, insistent, 
and pregnant with great births for the blessing or the 
damaging of the race. 
(c) The Church 
That education which has most worth bears relation 
also to another institution of historic tradition and 
significance, the Church. The Church may stand for 
two extreme forms and forces: (1) the individual 
Christian congregation and (2) the Roman Catholic 
Church and the Greek Orthodox Church. The indi- 
vidualistic unity of the one body stands out in dis- 
“Property and Personality,” by Professor Henry Scott 
Holland, D.D., from “Property, Its Duties and Rights,” essays 
by various writers (Macmillan), pp. 202-203.
-P-A-G-E-225

tinct and historic contrast with the comprehensiveness 
of the other two communions. 
The Church, in its smallest or in its greatest unity, 
and under specific or broadest names, is in this day 
placed in a crisis. Always indeed it has been in a 
crisis, as Archbishop Tait said in late life he had found 
it to be even from his youth. But the present emer- 
gency seems to be peculiarly and fundamentally criti- 
cal. The elements or reasons of this condition are 
not far to seek or hard to find. 
For, the function of the Church has narrowed. For- 
merly the Church was the chief agent in education. 
Today, this duty is largely committed to the civil gov- 
ernment or to private corporations or agencies. For- 
merly the Church was the director and the almoner of 
charity. Today, as in the case of education, this obli- 
gation is given to the state or municipality, or to per- 
sonally directed and supported organizations. 
The Protestant Church has also to a large degree 
lost, as its adherents, that part of the community 
known as the laboring class, and also that part which 
is called the intellectuals. At these two opposite ex- 
tremes occurs an elimination most significant. The 
causes of the loss of the intellectual classes are mani- 
fold, some evident and some obscure.. One cause, 
which is hardly a cause, but which may be called a 
conspiring condition, is the assurance that one may 
believe in religion who does not believe in the Church
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
as an organization or form of religion. Religion, it 
is declared, is an instinct deeply seated in the human 
constitution; or it is also said to be an emotion, or 
it is affirmed to be a belief both intellectual and emo- 
tional. In any one of these relationships, it is ever 
to be respected and cultivated. It is primarily an 
individual and not a communal concern. But it is 
affirmed that the Church does not properly represent 
religion or properly use its forces. In answer to this 
charge, it is fitting for me to refer to the interpretation 
given by one of the ablest minds of the generation, 
Lord Balfour: 
“Tt seems easy, simple, obvious, to say that the 
relation of every soul to its Maker is a matter between 
its Maker and the soul, and that the aid of these 
organisations is superfluous, that it is of little assis- 
tance, that it may be a cause of discord, and cannot 
be of assistance in the spiritual path. I believe that 
to be a profound error. We are all human beings, 
and we must work under the conditions under which 
human beings alone can work, or, at all events, alone 
can work effectively—the conditions of being organ- 
ised. And, therefore, I have for myself to face the 
fact, and I do face it, that Christendom is and must 
remain ecclesiastically divided, that the Churches into 
which it is divided are necessary for the spiritual wel- 
fare of the world, and that what we have to do is to 
be able to see, beyond the separate organisation to
-P-A-G-E-227
eee ee re ne ee 
Results 215 
which we all belong, the greater whole of which we 
are all members.”?® 
A further cause which the members of the intel- 
lectual class allege as their reason for withdrawing 
from the Church lies in what is called its lack of 
reality. Its creeds are charged with being artificial, 
its prayers are declared to be pious sentimentalism, 
its sermons are said to lack intellectual substance, its 
priests are indicted as pretending to believe what 
they do not, as counterfeiting virtues which they fail 
to possess, as leading in movements of which they, in 
judgment, do not approve, and in heart abhor. 
Allied with such a condition of insincerity which, 
say the intellectuals, all classes recognize, is the dis- 
belief, more or less fundamental, in the Church as of 
supernatural origin or authority. Its sacred books 
and institutions are not accepted as sacred. The be- 
lief is held that the Church was, and is, as natural, as 
human, an institution as are the other two institutions 
which the Middle Ages handed over to the modern 
world, the university and the empire. Upon beliefs 
supernatural, upon creeds and teachings presumably 
of divine source and authority, the Church is founded. 
Such a belief the intellectual man finds himself unable 
to accept. Therefore, he declines also to be devoted 
to the superstructure of the Church itself. 
“The Mind of Arthur James Balfour,’ by Wilfrid M. 
Short, p. 76.
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
It is also to be said that this individual man of the 
intellectual type feels little or no need of the Church. 
He lives what he regards as a complete life. Family, 
friends, work, books, people, travel, minister to him 
of their resources. The past is past, and it is not. 
The future is future, and it likewise is not. The 
present alone is real: it is very much to him, and in 
it and for it, he rejoices, exults, and serves. 
Akin to these causes, and subsidiary to them, are 
also two which merit mention. One is the fact of the 
belief that the ministry and priesthood of the Church 
are mediocre in intellectual ability, commonplace in 
social relationships, and inefficient in sacred service. 
A further intimation lies in the fact that the intel- 
lectual man is absorbed in his own work and play and 
devotions. Sunday, the great day of the Church, is 
his great day of social engagements, of pleasures, and 
of duties. For the service of the Church on that day, 
as on other days, he has no inclination or sense of 
obligation. For doing the duties, or for enjoying 
the rights which these services represent, he discovers 
no proper opportunity. 
It is interesting to find that reasons, in part similar 
and in part dissimilar, are causing the absence of the 
working man from association with this historic insti- 
tution. He, too, holds a belief in Jesus, the carpenter. 
But he declares the Church does not speak the message 
of Jesus, that the Church disobeys Christ’s command-
-P-A-G-E-229
Results 217 
ments, and neglects Christ’s beatitudes. The person 
of the Christ, which the Churches preach, the work- 
ingman declares is not the person whom the gospels 
present. The workingman finds, or believes he finds, 
moreover, that the Church has no fellowship with him 
as an individual and no sympathy with his endeavors 
for self-betterment. It offers him no warm welcome in 
attending its services and it extends no codperation 
with his unions and boards. He regards the Church 
as a project and organ of the capitalist and employer, 
and, therefore, he will have naught to do with such a 
tool or conspirator. He, too, finds the Church unreal 
in its relation to the activities of his own life. He 
feels small or no need of its messages and ministries. 
This lengthy interpretation leads to the question, 
what can the education of the most worth do in this 
crisis to aid the Church? 
Education, of course, can and does give discipline, 
training, equipment, to the ordained ministry and 
priesthood. Such training is of necessary worth. No 
Church without the priesthood, no priesthood without 
the scholar, is the order. If, historically, the Church, 
through the Pope, or through Convocation, founded 
and nourished the higher education, education in turn, 
for all succeeding centuries, has been trying to pay the 
priceless debt. 
Giving training and equipment to the priesthood, 
education has also been the interpreter of the sacred
-P-A-G-E-230
  218 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
books of the Church. Christianity and Mohammedan- 
ism are founded upon a book, as well as upon a per- 
sonality. These writings are of infinite worth to the 
believer, be he lay or clerical. Ignorance cannot ex- 
pound; or, if it make the attempt, its expositions are 
worse than failures in interpretation. Scholarship 
teaches, and its teachings are as essential as is the 
pious nurture of belief. 
A third contribution which education having the 
most worth makes to the Church flows from or through 
the two preceding, namely, education teaches that 
religion is rational, and that the Church as its organ 
has a foundation in reason, as well as in piety. That 
God is a person, and, being a person, is rational, is 
an article of the creeds. The belief, too, that the testi- 
mony of conscience is sound, is a fundamental belief. 
The deliverances of the intellect upon the themes pre- 
sented to it are in accordance with the emotions of 
the heart, for man is one. The witness of the spirit in 
man affirms that the conclusions of the mind respect- 
ing religion and its Church cannot be other than 
rational. They cannot be anti-rational. They would, 
in this case, be no conclusions at all. They cannot be 
unrational. For they do essentially belong to the 
realm of the rational. Belief is founded on reason, 
as well as on faith. One believes, not because he is 
beset with impossibilities contrary to evidence. One 
believes because a proposition is in accordance with
-P-A-G-E-231
      Results 219 
evidence. The form of the rational, or the objects to 
which it applies itself, may change. The problem of 
the personality of Christ was the problem of the 
middle decades of the last century. The problem of 
the relation of science and religion was the problem 
which perplexed men in the two score of years be- 
tween 1860 and 1900. Each problem has essentially 
passed. The problem of human relationships is the 
present problem. That problem, too, will be solved 
on the basis of reason. Karl Marx said that the Re- 
formation was the work of a monk, that revelation 
must be the work of a philosopher. The modern 
Church, standing for religign, belongs to the philo- 
sophic reason. 
In this sphere of the rational, education may serve 
the Church in affirming the value of the sense of 
worship of God. Worship is the communion of the 
individual with the divine. The fact belongs to all 
religions. It represents thought and feeling. It em- 
bodies the prayer of either gratitude or of petition. 
It is the quickening of the soul of man. It is both 
inspiration and aspiration. It belongs to the highest 
mood of the human spirit, raising that spirit to the 
infinite, holy, and universal. It is the oneness of the 
under-soul with the over-soul. 
Such are the gifts which education of most worth 
may give to the Church. They are gifts infinitely 
precious. They represent works of noblest service.

  220 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
They are achievements which, won to-day, are to 
become richer and more achieving with each passing 
generation. They endure, under diverse forms and in 
varying fullness, so long as man survives. 
(d) The State 
One of the more pregnant remarks made by any 
thinker within the last two generations is the remark 
of Sir Henry Sumner Maine, that “the movement of 
the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement 
from Status to Contract.”’* At the present time, how- 
ever, the reverse seems to becoming true. Society is 
moving back from contract to status. This move- 
ment, however, may be an eddy in the stream of 
human affairs. (At all events, and in all events, the 
status is coming to fill a large and serious part in the 
interpretation and conduct of the affairs of the State 
and of its people. The State is the political organi- 
zation of the people. This organization takes on in 
constant enlargements the democratic form. Within a 
decade, the number of democracies in the world has 
tripled. Whether this process of increase is to con- 
tinue, no prophet is wise enough to intimate. The 
prophet who is not wise declares that it is to continue. 
But it would be hazardous indeed to attempt to fore- 
tell the type which human government will assume 
*“Ancient Law,” by Sir Henry Sumner Maine, Chapter V, 
p. 165.

among the peoples in the next decades and centuries. 
For different forms are emerging, certain forms being 
genuine, others at least partially counterfeit. De- 
mocracy as embodied in communism, democracy as 
embodied in socialism, democracy as embodied in 
republicanism of either the representative assembly 
or of the cabinet, democracy as embodied in the rep- 
resentative executive, democracy as embodied in the 
referendum and initiative, democracy as embodied in 
the general strike or the class-war, represent intima- 
tions of the types which the democratic State may 
assume. 
All of these types, so different in certain respects, 
have yet certain elements in common. One element 
seen in each type is political liberty. This element has 
been gained and has become apparently permanent. 
A second element is so-called equality. This element 
still represents struggle, especially in the field of eco- 
nomics. . The third element, which is still further from 
being won than equality, is brotherhood. It requires 
no extended view in either space or time to see that 
the present tendency in all these types is a movement 
from democracy toward autocracy or oligarchy. The 
legislative relation is subjected to the executive. The 
demand becomes more insistent, not for the wise, but 
for the strong, man. The tendency is to make govern- 
ment a coup d’état. The administrative office becomes 
more important than the legislative halls. These three,
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
liberty, equality, brotherhood, are constituent and 
common parts of modern democracy of all forms. 
An element, moreover, lacking in these various 
democratic movements, is that of intellectual altru- 
ism. This lack is of serious and sinister import. 
Each class in a democracy is prone to be blind and 
deaf to the fortunes or misfortunes, and to the consti- 
tution, of every other class. Each member, too, is 
altogether too willing to interpret the democratic con- 
dition from his own point of view, to think that his 
own attitude is the more or most wise, to accept his 
rights as preeminent, and to use his standards as the 
measures of all conduct. Selfishness, personal or com- 
munal, individual or national, intellectual, emotional, 
volitional, industrial, or economic, alike of workmen 
and of capitalists, is the one comprehensive vice and 
weakness of democracies of every type. 
What then is the duty of that education which has 
the most worth toward the democratic State? 
The most obvious answer to be given to this preg- 
nant question, as I have previously intimated, is that 
the education of the most worth should among every f 
people train unto worthiest leadership. The present 
is a time of the lack of leadership. No voice is com- 
manding, and no commandment unites all the peoples. 
The need of leadership that education which has most. 
worth must seek to fill. Education of every order 
must prepare the community to accept wise leader-

ship. The higher education has for its supreme func- 
tion the training and quickening of the better and the 
best men-unto becoming worthy shepherds of the 
people. The higher education teaches men to seek 
for, to find, and to tell the truth, to be just in weigh- 
ing evidence, to be accurate in observation, to be fair 
and full in making interpretation. The higher edu- 
cation aids men, in the association of the classroom 
and the common-room, on field and on river, to under- 
stand conditions, to take initiative, to combine, to 
urge campaigns, to suffer defeats hopefully, and to win 
victories humbly. Such provisions and such processes 
create and discipline leaders. Leaving out certain ex- 
ceptions, as Lincoln, the higher form of education of 
the most worth raises up, beyond all other agencies, 
the guides, the shepherds, the leaders of the people. 
Finally, the education of most worth, which may 
aid the democratic State, lies in the teaching and em- 
phasizing of a noble type of ethical idealism. The 
spirit of ethical idealism should prevail among all 
people. It represents the moral_law, as well as the 
intellectual verities. It gives to the cardinal virtues 
the beauty of the beatitudes, and to the beatitudes, 
the obligations of the cardinal virtues. It emphasizes 
the infinite value of character. It increases the sources 
of self-satisfaction in each individual. It makes plain 
that sound thinking has moral worth, and that good 
feeling and right volition have rational values. It
-P-A-G-E-236
  224 What Education Has the Most Worth? 
affirms, in season and out of season, that the common 
good has a value immeasurably greater than the indi- 
vidual, and that to will otherwise is social murder and 
ultimately individual suicide. It teaches that respon- 
sibility and power go hand in hand, and that, as power 
increases, duty enlarges. It preaches with Kant, from 
the housetop, and in the still, small voice, the sig- 
nificance of the “I ought.” While declaring individual 
obligation, it does not refrain from rationally inter- 
preting the communal command. The ethical idealism 
which education of the most worth teaches to the 
State, concerns the interest of all the people, and yet 
does not neglect the individual. It seeks to gather up 
traditions and to foresee and to forecast the future, 
without suffering any neglect of the present. It does, 
without blindness to its own immediate environment, 
endeavor to hold before the individual State the rights 
of all other commonwealths. It seeks, interpreting the 
past, to enlarge and to make more definite the vision 
of the future. It tries to show the proper diversities 
existing in an age devoted to conformity. It fails 
not to acknowledge the worth of conformity in an age 
of diverse forms and forces. It seeks out ways and 
methods by which the multitudes may nourish the 
worth of the individual man. It tries to adjust the 
fact of philosophic doubt with visions and beliefs, and 
to show the relation of knowledge to agnosticism. It 
endeavors to reconcile special knowledge and research
-P-A-G-E-237
Results 225 
with a synthesis that unites parts into and unto prin- 
ciples. It also tries to unite the efficiency of mechan- 
ical and material arrangements with the love and 
approbation of personal teaching, of individual asso- 
ciation and of communal appreciation. Ethical ideal- 
ism in the service of the worthiest education for 
the State should, in a final and comprehensive word, 
through rational truth, and through allegiance to the 
law of duty and of right, devote itself to the incar- 
nation of the greatest which the reason can consider, 
of the noblest which the heart of man can feel and of 
the best which the will of man can choose. Such are 
some of the services which education having the most 
worth gives to man,—a citizen of the State, a mem- 
ber of the community.

  PREFACE 
Tue value of the ability to read understandingly and 
rapidly is being recognized more and more by people 
in all walks of life. The possession of reading ability 
makes it possible for one to enrich his own life, become 
more efficient in his chosen work, and be of greater serv- 
ice to the world. 
The psychologists, realizing the fundamental impor- 
tance of reading in life, have made a scientific study 
of the reading process. They have ascertained through 
scientific experiments the factors which determine 
good reading. The ability consciously to make use of 
these factors is the chief means by which an adult can 
increase his efficiency in reading and by which the 
youth of the land can form correct habits of reading. 
It is of fundamental importance, then, that the re- 
sults of scientific experiments in reading be turned to 
account in the teaching of reading in our schools. The 
classroom teacher needs to understand and appreciate 
the work of the psychologist. Her greatest need, how- 
ever, is to be able to make use of this scientific knowl- 
edge in the development of good reading habits in 
children. 
How to Teach Reading develops and states the 
psychological principles involved in reading in such a 
way that one not versed in psychological terms can

understand and appreciate them. Above all, it gives to 
the classroom teacher and the individual interested in 
increasing his reading power practical suggestions for 
the development of both silent and oral reading habits. 
These suggestions are based upon the best psychology 
of the times. They have been tried out in all grades of 
the elementary school and have been found effective. 
It is hoped that this book will be found helpful to 
the classroom teacher in both rural and city schools, 
to the supervisor, to the normal-school instructor, to 
the mother who wishes to help her child at home, and 
to the citizen who wishes to increase his efficiency in 
reading. 
In How to Teach Reading the authors have endeav- 
ored: 
1. To present such a method based upon psycholog- 
ical principles that the method can be used with 
any reading material having content value. 
2. To indicate definite objectives in appreciations, 
habits, and skills for the various grades. 
3. To give suggestive materials, methods, lesson 
plans, and activities for the attainment of those 
objectives in appreciations, habits, and skills. 
4. To show how geographical, historical, and news- 
paper material can be used to advantage in the 
reading period. 
5. To suggest how progressive training can be given 
in the effective use of a reader, dictionary, en- 
cyclopeedia, and card catalogue. 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  PREFACE v 
6. To show how group and individual work in the 
between-recitation period can be utilized for the 
development of reading power. 
7. To give practical suggestions for the diagnosis of 
reading ability through the use of informal tests, 
standard tests, and intelligence tests, and suggest 
practical ways of remedying defects revealed by 
the diagnosis. 
We, the authors, wish to acknowledge our indebted- 
ness to all those whose scientific experiments have 
furnished the data upon which How to Teach Reading 
is based. We wish also to express our appreciation 
to those leaders in education who have been such a 
source of inspiration and practical help in the writing 
of this book. 
Further acknowledgment is due to the authors and 
publishers who have so generously granted us permis- 
sion to use from their books quotations and material 
for illustrative purposes.

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
PART I 
EFFICIENT READING IN LIFE 
CHAPTER I 
WHY ‘EFFECTIVE READING IS OF FUNDAMENTAL 
IMPORTANCE IN LIFE 
Have you ever considered what per cent of your 
waking hours is spent within the sight of printed or 
written symbols? As you pass through the streets of 
a city, you are surrounded with street signs, traffic 
notices, safety rules, names of business houses, adver- 
tisemnents in store windows and in the street car in 
which you may be riding. You go to an entertain- 
ment, and you secure printed tickets, a program is 
handed to you giving printed details, a synopsis of the 
play or symphony, the coming attractions, and adver- 
tisements of local firms. When going away for a 
-yacation, time-tables are given you to consult, and 
descriptions of interesting places to visit. 
The housewife is surrounded by labels on packages, 
cans, bottles, directions for the care and use of mate- 
rials, and recipes. The newspaper is brought to the 
door calling her attention to the current news of the

day, the advantages of various labor-saving devices, 
and opportunities for the economic expenditure of 
money. 
After reaching his place of business, a man is pre- 
sented with the morning’s mail, reports, and literature 
concerning his business. Orders and directions to 
increase the efficiency of various departments must be 
read or written. Even during the lunch hour, he must 
read the bill of fare or menu. During all his business 
hours his eye is constantly assailed with printed or 
written material. 
The ability to interpret this mass of material con- 
stantly presented to one’s sight is necessary for com- 
plete living and helps one to adjust himself to his 
environment no matter what that may be. 
Wuy Apvutts Rrap a 
The desire to ng The adult’s needs for reading 
are most varied. There seems to be in every one an 
feeling, doing. / While this desire in a measure can be 
met by personal contacts, it can be fully satisfied only 
by the ability to read the records of the present and 
past, which are embodied in books, papers, and maga- 
zines. \This instinctive craving for news may not 
spring from any desire to make practical use of the 
information gained. It is more a craving for an 
enlargement and deepening of experiences or to-secure 
new sensations.) / instinctive e to know what others are thinking,

-P-A-G-E-13
WHY ADULTS READ 3 
“ Guided and animated by this impulse to acquire 
knowledge and exercise his imagination through 
reading, the individual will continue to educate him- 
self all through life. Without that deep-rooted crav- 
ing he will soon cease to draw on the accumulated 
wisdom of the past and the new resources of the 
present, and as he grows older he will live in a mental 
atmosphere which is always growing thinner and 
emptier.” ! 
For vocational sate: Gries is, however, a desire 
for information which makes possible greater efficiency 
in furthering one’s life activities. No vocation or 
avocation of any kind can be conducted successfully 
unless one is able to supplement his own experience 
with the experiences of others. While much of this 
information can be gained by talking with and observ- 
ing others, only the literate man is able to command 
the untold wealth of experience which is embodied in 
printed form, for the guidance of his own career. 
Sow pleasure. The reading for mere pleasure isnot 
to be discredited. Every one needs such a means of 
relaxation as the reading of a good novel, short story, 
or other forms of literary material \ The pleasure may 
consist in the enjoyment of the development of the 
‘plot, the character portrayal, beautiful descriptions, 
or the author’s style and use of words. Often the 
pleasure consists in getting away from the work of the

day by changing the current of one’s thoughts. In 
times of great trouble the reason has been saved by the 
ability to forget one’s self through reading. Reading 
is often indulged in merely as a means of killing time. 
One reads when waiting for a train or business appoint- 
ment. The love for reading and the appreciation of 
the best in literature should be developed, as they are 
the greatest safeguards of leisure time. 
For the satisfaction of suppressed desires.\\ Modern 
life presents circumscribed cycles of experience. 
Many desires cannot be realized except vicariously. 
Reading is one of the greatest means for the satis- 
faction of such suppressed desires. It gives one the 
ability to sink his life into the lives of others2| The 
history of the pioneers of our own country makes it 
possible to enter into a life of adventure and exploita- 
¥ tion; if travel is denied, through books one can journey 
to distant lands, viewing the wonders and beauties of 
the works of God and men. The satisfaction of this 
craving for denied experiences can best be met through 
books which enable one to live all types of experience. 
For the understanding of life. How one longs to 
understand life! With the eyes of sense one sees but a 
little way, and sees but fragments. One is too close to 
events to get the right perspective. Biography, his- 
tory, and novels are not the “ mirror of life, but life in 
the mirror.” (It is only in books that one can see it, 
and find the complete action which satisfies his innate 
desire to know the end of things. In books one has all

of civilization at his command. They present a clear 
window through which one can look out upon existence. 
In them one can see life steadily and see it whole.) 
For the guidance of life. One not only longs and 
needs to understand life, but he must also have a chart 
and compass for the guidance of his own existence. 
Reading furnishes one of the means for securing the 
ideals and spiritual truths necessary for the intelligent 
guidance of life. Ideals and standards of right action 
are necessary for the formation of habits which make it 
possible for one to live in right relation to his fellow 
men and with God. 
Effective reading, then, is of fundamental import- 
ance in life because of the universal presence of the 
printed symbol, because of the instinctive desire to 
enlarge experiences, and because of the need of secur- 
ing’ vocational and avocational efficiency. It is 
necessary for pleasure, for the satisfaction of sup- 
pressed desires, and for the understanding and guid- 
ance of life. )

¢ Children have many and varied needs for reading. 
The general needs are the same for the child as for the 
adult, differing only in degree depending upon the 
maturity of the individual. } The child may be uncon- 
scious of the needs that drive him to books, but never- 
theless books satisfy his vague longings and desires. 
The young child doubtless reads for pleasure, to sat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 HOW TO TEACH READING 
isfy his curiosity or a general desire to know. Soon, 
however, he finds that books give him directions for 
making or doing the things in which he is interested. 
The adolescent’s craving for new sensations, his 
desire to understand life and to live amid conditions 
and surroundings different from his own, can be met 
only through reading. The city boy can live among 
the wonders and beauties of nature, the country boy 
can see and feel the pulsing life of a great city. Read- 
ing enables the child to see, know, and relive all types 
of experience. If reading is guided along right lines, 
a wealth of information and an enlargement of inter- 
ests result, individual needs are satisfied, enlargement 
of sympathies and understanding of life are gained, 
and ideals are formed that should result in social and 
individual progress. In short, reading gives the child 
the ability to live a richer, fuller, and more complete life. : 
Since effective reading is of such fundamental 
importance in the life of the youth and adult, it is of 
vital significance that every one should know what 
factors condition effective reading. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Why is effective reading of fundamental importance in adult 
life? In child life? 
2. Give an example from your own experience of various motives 
which have caused you to read. 
8. Make a list of all the different uses of printed and written 
symbols you see in the waking hours of one day. 
4, Watch the reading of a certain child. Keep a record of types 
of reading done and his reasons for reading. 
5. What abilities do you think you must possess in order to read 
effectively? 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
CHAPTER II 
WHAT CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE READING IN LIFE 
One must want and love toread. The various needs 
for reading discussed in the previous chapter constitute 
the most important factors in making for efficiency 
in reading. These needs cause the individual to want 
to read so that finally a love for reading is developed. 
When one wants to read, more pleasure results, more 
material is read, and ease and facility are secured. 
These needs make possible sustained attention. 
Wandering thoughts do not have to be called back to 
the material when the need and desire for reading come 
from within. All forces of the individual then are 
working in harmony to gain the desired result. 
One must be able to get the thought. One must not 
only want and love to read, but one must be able to 
get the thought from what is read. For instance, a 
man’s employees are becoming restless and dissatisfied. 
He wants to find out how others have solved similar 
situations. Articles dealing with this problem are 
read. He must be able to understand the circum- 
stances and remedies presented by the author. Then 
he judges what remedies, if any, would be pertinent in 
his own situation. These he selects, organizes, and 
adapts to the solution of his own problem. Only as 
he is able to get the meaning from the material read  
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 HOW TO TEACH READING 
can he understand and appreciate the author’s point 
of view. 
The efficient reader must not only be able to get 
ideas, sentiments, or facts expressed by the author, 
but he must be able to judge the worth of these in 
relation to the purpose or purposes for which he is 
reading. ‘This calls for a fine type of judgment. 
Judgment must also be exercised in the selecting and 
organizing of the most valuable facts for the carrying- 
out of his purposes. While the desire and love for 
reading, then, furnish the motive power or desire for 
the process of reading, the effective reader must have 
the ability to get the meaning from the reading 
symbols. 
One must have command over the mechanics of 
reading. To be able to read, one must also have the 
ability to recall meanings carried by the symbols. 
» Symbols are mere carriers of meaning. This recall 
must be so ready that it is almost unconscious, in order 
that the maximum of attention can be given to the 
interpretation of the meanings of symbols in any given 
situation. One must also be able to keep in mind 
meanings already gained, and carry them on and 
modify them from sentence to sentence, paragraph to 
paragraph, chapter to chapter, book to book. 
One must be able to read rapidly. The most 
effective worker in any field is the one who can accom- 
plish the work well in the shortest length of time; 
so, to be efficient in reading, one must be able to read 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  WHAT CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE READING 9 
rapidly. The rapidity with which one reads will © 
depend upon the character of the material, the pur- 
pose for which one reads, and the ability of the 
individual. 
One must be able to use the tools of reading 
effectively. Work of any kind must be carried on by 
the use of tools. An efficient workman must have 
good tools; he must have accurate knowledge of his 
tools and ability to use them skillfully. Good books, 
magazines, and newspapers are the tools of the reader. 
The skillful reader must know where to go to find the 
information he needs and be able to locate it as 
directly and as quickly as possible. This necessitates 
the knowledge of and the ability to use the make-up 
of a book, magazine, newspaper, encyclopedia, card 
catalogue, and dictionary. When the reader encoun- 
ters an unfamiliar word, he must be able to master it 
as quickly as possible. 
One must have the ability to read well silently. 
The major type of reading done in life is silent reading; 
therefore, the efficient reader is the one who can get 
the thought through silent reading accurately and 
rapidly. Good silent reading depends upon a desire 
to read, ability to get the thought, ability to recall, 
ability to read rapidly, and to use the tools of reading 
effectively. 
One must have reasonable ability in oral reading. 
Many times in life, full appreciation or interpretation 
of material cannot take place unless the material is  
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 HOW TO TEACH READING 
read aloud. Enjoyment is enhanced by the sharing of 
beautiful descriptions, conversations, emotional pas- 
sages, and poetry. Giving utterance to the words 
sometimes aids in the interpretation of the thought. 
An efficient reader must be able to have this means of 
interpretation and expression. Good oral reading 
depends upon the factors governing good silent reading 
and in addition good enunciation, pronunciation, and 
voice control. 
The knowledge of the importance of reading in life 
and of what constitutes good reading is necessary if 
one wants to increase his own ability to read well and 
is of vital importance if one is to help teach children 
so that they can become efficient readers. Definite 
ways and means of developing habits of good reading 
are taken up in the remaining chapters of this book.

TO BECOME EFFICIENT READERS 
CHAPTER III 
HOW THE CHILD CAN BE STIMULATED IN HIS DESIRE 
AND LOVE FOR READING 
By SurrounDING CHILDREN WITH 
Reaping STIMULI 
CHILDREN are constantly exploring and investigating 
everything in their environment. They bring all of 
their senses to bear upon a new object, handling it, 
tasting it, taking it apart to find out all they can 
about the unknown. These are natural responses due 
to the stimuli of objects in the child’s environment. 
The so-called “ destructiveness ” of children is largely 
a response caused by their curiosity and their desire 
to know and master everything about them. 
Whenever we want to give a child a new experience, 
this new experience must be brought into his environ- 
ment directly or indirectly, so that his natural instincts 
will be stimulated and the right responses made, If a 
pair of roller skates are placed in the playroom, the 
child will investigate these and soon learn how to use 
them. If we want the child living in the Middle West 
to have an interest in the ocean, it may be impossible 
to give him the real experience by taking him to the
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 HOW TO TEACH READING 
ocean, but, through pictures, stories, poems, brought 
into his environment, the experience can be brought 
to him indirectly. 
When we wish to increase a child’s appetite, we 
place tempting foods before him in order that he may 
be stimulated to eat more. All of these illustrations 
go to prove that all acts of conduct are responses to 
some sort of stimulating situation. When a stimulus 
is received by the nervous system through any. of the 
senses, we are so made that some kind of a response 
follows. The pathway that this stimulus makes, as it 
is handed on from nerve to nerve, until it goes out in 
some kind of a response, is called a “bond.” All 
learning consists in the making and modifying of 
such bonds. 
Some of the responses made as a result of stimuli are 
practically beyond our control, as the knee jerk and 
other reflexes. These bonds are already formed when 
we come into the world. Most responses, however, 
must be made or modified. 
(The child was stimulated by the presence of the 
roller skates to form the bonds necessary for him to 
learn how to skate. When we want a child to become 
interested in forming the bonds that are necessary for 
reading to take place, one of the most effective means 
is to place reading stimuli in his environment. This 
may be done in the schoolroom through the use of the 
following means: 
1. Directions or questions written on the board.
-P-A-G-E-23
  EP ; \ 
> ‘YD fi 
oc READING STIMULI 18 ¢ 
Whenever possible in the first grade, directions or 
questions, such as, “Girls stand,” “Come to me,” 
“What shall we sing?” should be written on the 
board rather than given orally. These directions and 
questions will give an interest and need for reading 
and an added opportunity for practice in silent read- 
ing. They will furnish a means for the presentation of 
new words and for the clinching of words already 
developed. 
(For suggestions see page 162.) 
2. Greetings. Greetings can be used in the same 
way and for the same purposes as directions and ques- 
-tions. They furnish, however, greater opportunity 
for the development of thought and vocabulary. 
Beginning with .a simple greeting, such as, “ Good- 
morning, boys and girls,” the greeting can be increased 
until finally the children will enjoy and be able te 
read a greeting such as, 
“*Good-morning, boys and girls. 
This is Thursday. 
It is a warm, sunny day. 
We can play out doors. 
We can play Puss-in-the-Corner.” 
(For suggestions see page 169.) 
3- Picture books. Pictures representing child life 
in various activities, animals and toys, always make 
an appeal to children. They want to know the names 
of the pictures and what stories the pictures are telling. 
A simple sentence, or sentences written or printed 
below the picture telling the name of the picture, or
-P-A-G-E-24
14 HOW TO TEACH READING 
a story about it, stimulate the child’s desire and love 
for reading. These picture books could be made by 
the children in the second and third grade, thus moti- 
vating their work in language, spelling, writing, and 
handwork. 
(For suggestions see page 175.) 
4. Library table. A library table furnished with a 
collection of miscellaneous books should be in every 
grade of the elementary school. In the lower grades 
these books should contain such easy reading material 
that the child is able and interested in reading these 
during odd moments of the day. The children should 
be allowed to use these books after the assigned work 
of the between-recitation period has been completed. 
This will do away with the usual waste of time during 
this period. These books should not be those which 
the teacher uses with children in the recitation period. 
In the upper grades, in addition to easy supple- 
mentary material, there should be on the library 
table reference books dealing with historical and geo- 
graphical material. Copies of the best current maga- 
zines will furnish much material along the line of 
current events. 
(For suggestions see page 227.) 
5- Pictures with simple stories attached. Pic- 
tures with simple stories attached may be used on the 
library table in the first grade. The stories may be 
made by the children themselves during the language 
period or by children of the second and third grades.
-P-A-G-E-25
  
READING STIMULI 15 
When made by the first-grade children, the teacher 
should print or write the story. 
(For suggestions see page 175.) 
6. Bulletin boards. Bulletin boards can be used 
to advantage in all grades in the elementary school. 
The nature of the material placed upon the bulletin 
board will vary with the interests and maturity of the 
children. In the first and second grades, the teacher 
should be largely responsible for the placing on the 
bulletin board of such materials as, 
A new picture with or without a short story attached. 
Records of birds, flowers, seeds, observed. 
Plans for the celebration of festivals or records of,celebra- 
ee records for the carrying-out of an activity. 
Items of current news brought in by the children. 
The best work of the children done in various subjects. 
In the middle and upper grades greater responsi- 
bility should be borne by the children for the selection 
of the material and the placing of it on the bulletin 
board. Groups of children may be held responsible 
for the bringing-in of material, or committees may be 
appointed to pass upon material brought in by the 
whole group. 
To stimulate the desire and love for reading, the 
following types of material might be used: 
Geographical material about places studied. 
Historical material. 
Items of current news. 
Nature-study items. 
Plans and records of activities.
-P-A-G-E-26
16 HOW TO TEACH READING 
The best work of the children done in various subjects. 
Pictures for appreciation and original story-telling. 
7. Picture puzzles with stories attached. Picture 
puzzles with stories attached may be used as stimuli 
for reading. The nature and difficulty of these will 
depend upon the maturity and interests of the children. 
8. Blackboard or chart stories. These stories may 
be based upon some excursion taken, children’s toys, 
pets, games, and other activities in the home or 
neighborhood. After such stories have been devel- 
oped as reading lessons, they may be placed about the 
room and used as material for small reading groups. 
9. Moving pictures or slides. Visual education is 
being used more and more as a means of enlarging 
experience and clarifying ideas. The seeing of pic- 
tures stimulates the child to want to know more about 
the representations shown. This he can satisfy by 
reading the descriptions accompanying the pictures 
and finding added information in reference books. 
By Sevectine Inrerestinc Materia 
Varied material, suited to the interests and experi- 
ences of children. The careful selection of suitable 
reading material is one of the greatest means for 
stimulating the development of an interest in and a 
taste for good reading. Upon this taste for good 
reading, Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of 
Harvard, has said depends the uplifting of the demo- 
cratic masses. Material for reading must be suited to
-P-A-G-E-27
2 INTERESTING MATERIAL 7 
the interests and experiences of children at every stage 
of their development in order that a love of reading 
may be stimulated and that the reader may have the 
ability to interpret the thought of the selection. As 
the range of children’s interests is great, so material 
chosen for reading lessons must be very varied. Basal 
and supplementary books should contain, not only 
literary material, but selections relating to the world 
of nature and human experiences. Magazines and news- 
papers furnish a wealth of good material for reading. 
Seasonable material. Teachers must realize that 
material to be interesting to children must be season- 
able. Children want to read Thanksgiving stories at 
Thanksgiving time. To secure seasonable material, 
supplementary books along with the basal material 
must be constantly used. The new readers contain 
a wealth of varied material interesting to childhood; 
it remains for the teacher to select and to use this at 
appropriate times. 
Related to other schoolroom activities. Activities 
going on in other lines of school work should also be 
a basis for the selection of reading material. While 
the children are working out a project in geography, 
part of the reading time may well be spent upon geo- 
graphical material pertinent to the activity. Often- 
times such recitation periods will be spent by indi- 
viduals or groups reporting upon or reading related 
geographical material rather than the entire class 
reading a uniform selection on the topic.
-P-A-G-E-28
18 HOW TO TEACH READING 
In the first grade, blackboard lessons made by the 
teacher and children give greater opportunity to 
relate material more closely to the interests of par- 
ticular groups of children than selections found in 
books. While blackboard lessons should predominate 
in beginning reading, occasions arise when they can be 
used to advantage in the second and third grades. 
For types of material definitely suited for the different 
grades, see page 160. 
By Creatine A SociraL ATMOSPHERE 
The social grouping of children. The more natural 
and social grouping of children, made possible by the 
movable equipment which is rapidly replacing the old 
fixed desks and seats, furnishes another stimulus 
which tends to increase a child’s love and desire to 
read. In life we have all realized how social inter- 
course is promoted or hindered by the grouping of 
people. The social grouping of individuals about a 
fireplace or reading table tends to promote conversa- 
tion while the straight rows of seats in an auditorium 
or lecture hall checks any desire to participate in the 
topic under discussion. If adults are influenced to 
such an extent by the mere arrangement of groups, 
how much more so are children. The social feeling 
created in a classroom does much to foster a liking 
for subject-matter itself. Let it not be thought that 
the bringing of children to the front of the room in a 
social group is a waste of time.

A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE 19 
When the room is not equipped with movable 
furniture, the following means have been found suc- 
cessful in the lower grades, for the forming of a social 
group: 
1. Having children sit on the floor, providing the hygienic 
conditions are suitable. 
2. Using strips of straw matting or a grass rug. 
Note: These can be rolled up against the wall when 
not in use. 
8. Using individual grass mats or chair seats. 
Note: These can be stacked in a corner of the room and 
obtained by the children as they come out for the 
recitation. 
4, Using squares of oilcloth or heavy paper. 
Note: These can be kept in the children’s desks. 
The social influence of small groups should also be 
utilized during the between-recitation period. (See 
page 121.) 
The management of the recitation period. A 
social feeling can be increased by a more natural way 
of calling upon children during the recitation period. 
The old way of calling upon children in rotation was 
anti-social and often caused inattention to result 
because the child could judge when he would be called 
upon to read. 
By THe UTIuizatIon OF THE v 
Laws or LEaRNING 
Under the use of reading stimuli as a means for 
increasing the child’s desire and love for reading, the 
point was developed that all learning consists in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
20 HOW TO TEACH READING 
making and modifying of stimulus-response bonds. 
If we desire to make the child eager and ready to form 
bonds necessary for reading, we must know how learn- 
ing takes place. Just as there are laws governing 
the natural world, so learning is regulated by laws. 
These laws are the Laws of Readiness, Effect, and 
Exercise. 
1. The Law of Readiness. When a modifiable bond 
is ready to act, to act gives satisfaction and not to act 
gives annoyance. When a bond is not ready to act, 
to be forced to act gives annoyance. 
When a boy wants to go fishing, anything that tends 
to thwart his desire causes great annoyance. This de- 
sire for fishing causes the act of digging in the ground 
for angleworms, walking two or three miles to the 
brook, and sitting in the hot sun, to be pleasurable, 
while the same length of time spent in cultivating the 
garden, which the boy was compelled to do by some one 
else, would be most wearisome and annoying. A boy 
will spend any length of time and any amount of effort 
in perfecting his technique in baseball, in order that he 
may be able to play on the team. When a girl desires 
to read a certain book, the act of reading gives satisfac. 
tion; not to be able to read the book causes great annoy- 
ance. These illustrations show the effect which readi- 
ness has upon the formation of bonds, or the process 
of learning. The problem of the school is to utilize this 
Law of Readiness to increase the child’s desire to read. 
In the above illustrations there was some motive  
-P-A-G-E-31
I THE LAWS OF LEARNING 21 
present which caused the carrying-out of the purpose 
to be pleasurable. To stimulate the child’s desire to 
read, the following motives can be used: 
1. To tell the story to an audience, such as, another group, 
grade, school officers, an assembly, Parent-Teachers’ 
meeting. 
2. To cut, illustrate, or model the characters or important 
parts of the story. 
8. To dramatize or pantomime the story. 
4, To ariswer questions, as in “The Town Mouse and 
The Country Mouse,” “Which mouse had the better 
home and why?”; in “The Kind Old Oak Tree,” 
“Why was the oak tree called kind?” 
. To follow directions for a game or piece of handwork. 
. To improve one’s ability and rate of getting thought. 
. To select poems, jokes, or animal stories for a class 
book. 
. To get information necessary to carry on a project. 
. To get information for all the school subjects. 
. To find the difference in the same story as told in two 
different readers. 
11. To make out questions on important points to ask 
each other. 
12. To find which story would be best to dramatize. 
13. To tell stories they have read at home. 
Note: These should be censored by the teacher. 
IDM ee) 
If a friend tells you that she has read a new book 
which is exceedingly worth while because of its deline- 
ation of character and use of English, you are at once 
made eager to read the book. While such an intro- 
duction, though effective, may not always be neces- 
sary to whet an adult’s interest in reading, an intro-. 
duction to reading material is important in childhood 
while the reading habit is being formed.
-P-A-G-E-32
22 HOW TO TEACH READING 
The use of an introduction. No matter how care- 
fully material is selected in relation to interests and 
needs of childhood, some linking up of the main 
thoughts of the new material with the child’s past 
experiences is necessary to increase interest in reading. 
This introduction aids in the “ warming-up ” period 
and gets the child into the swing of the material more 
quickly through his eagerness and readiness to read. 
Bringing to bear the child’s past experiences upon the 
new material not only increases his interest and readi- 
ness for reading, but makes him better able to interpret 
the thoughts and feelings embodied in the new 
material. 
The introduction should be short, and should lead 
directly into the heart of the selection without giving 
away the crux of the story. The use of pictures, real 
objects brought into the schoolroom, the recall of past 
experiences through conversation, and the use of 
excursions are means by which new material can be 
introduced. 
The use of a motive question. Closely following the 
introduction and growing out of it should be a motive 
question for reading. This motive will direct interest 
along definite lines and cause the right mind-set 
toward the material. The value of such a mind-set 
is that it urges the child from within to put forth 
effort to accomplish the purpose of the reading and 
makes any thwarting of his desire to read annoying. 
To cause the child to be eager and ready to read
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING 23 
the stories given below, the following introductions 
and motive questions might be used: 
The Poem, ‘‘ WisHine”’ 
Introduction and motive question: 
Have you ever wished you were not a little boy or 
girl? What have you wished you were? What made 
you wish that? 
In a poem I have here there are ever so many wishes 
made, but it doesn’t tell us who made them. What 
would you like to know about this poem? 
Child: I should like to know who made the wishes. 
Child: I want to know what the wishes are. 
How tHE CuripMunkK Gor HIS STRIPES 
Introduction and motive question: 
What is this a picture of? (Teacher shows a picture 
of a red squirrel and one of a chipmunk.) What is the 
easiest way to tell a chipmunk from a red squirrel? We 
have a story in our books that tells how the people of 
India think the chipmunk got his stripes. Let us read 
and find out how they think he got them and why. 
Tue Comine or ARTHUR 
Introduction and motive question: 
What is the ruler of our country called and how is he 
chosen? Are we ever without a ruler? What is Eng- 
land’s ruler called and how is he chosen? One time in 
England, so the story runs, there was no king. Find 
out how this happened and how the people finally knew 
who their rightful king was. 
2. The Law of Effect. In the illustration of the 
boy trying to develop skill in baseball, his mind-set 
was caused by the desire to become one of the team. 
This mind-set made him ready and eager to do the 
practicing necessary to attain this desired end. When
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 HOW TO TEACH READING 
he found in practicing that certain of his movements 
caused the ball to make the desired curves, pleasure 
resulted and he tried to produce the same movements 
again. Other movements, resulting in the throwing 
of poor balls brought such annoyance that the boy 
tried to eliminate these. 
The recognition of a successful play by his fellows 
produced added satisfaction and was an additional 
incentive for him to try and repeat the successful plays. 
Condemnation by his fellows caused such annoyance 
that it was an additional incentive to eliminate all 
such plays. Thus learning took place because bonds 
were strengthened or weakened as satisfaction or 
annoyance resulted. This is an illustration of the 
second Law of Learning, the Law of Effect. A modi- 
fiable bond is strengthened or weakened according 
as satisfyingness or annoyance attends its exercise. 
This Law of Effect must be utilized if the child is to be 
stimulated in his desire and love for reading. 
The use of an introduction and motive. By making 
the child ready and eager to read through the use of an 
appropriate introduction and motive, much has been 
done to cause reading to be satisfying. This satis- 
faction will result in the strengthening of the reading 
bonds. 
Recognition of effort and achievement. In addition 
to the satisfaction resulting from the child’s success 
in answering his purpose, additional satisfaction can 
be given him through the recognition of his efforts 
and achievements by his classmates and teacher.
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING 25 
The use of the individual graph. Besides the use of 
the introduction and motive and the recognition of 
effort and accomplishments by classmates and teach- 
ers, the Law of Effect can be utilized by the use of the 
individual'graph. In this individual graph, the child’s 
success or failure is indicated by the ascending or 
descending line. Satisfaction results to the child 
when the line ascends, annoyance accompanies the 
descending line. The joy felt in the ascending line 
becomes a further incentive for renewed effort and 
so successful reading bonds are strengthened. The 
annoyance accompanying the downward curve causes 
the child to determine to eliminate or overcome those 
habits or bonds which caused the descent of the 
line. 
For use of the individual graphs to stimulate certain 
definite habits, see Chapters VI and X. 
The use of thé class graph. The class graph can be 
used to show the median of class achievement as 
well as the highest and lowest individual score for the 
day. The line designating the class median does not 
show the individual achievement of each number of 
the group, but allows for comparisons between classes 
in the same school or different schools. The use of 
this graph fosters loyalty to the class as a whole. 
Each child should be made to feel that he is a part of 
a distinct social group to which he must be loyal. 
He can first of all be loyal only if he is doing his best 
to make a good record for his room in the regular

habits of pitching to be exercised day after day and

constant exercise of the bonds which gave pleasure 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    32 HOW TO TEACH READING 
and the disuse of those giving annoyance, habits or 
bonds necessary for pitching would never have been 
formed. This shows the operation of the third Law 
of Learning, the Law of Exercise. Exercise, attended 
by pleasurable results, tends to strengthen bonds, 
disuse to weaken them. 
The easy mastery of the mechanics of reading is 
‘absolutely necessary in order that the child may 
desire and have a love for reading. This mastery 
can be secured only through much practice or drill. 
Unless, however, the drill or exercise is accompanied 
with pleasure and urged from within, as was the case 
of the boy practicing ball-pitching, habits or bonds 
necessary for the mastery of reading may not be 
established and a positive dislike for reading may 
result. : 
The use of the right type of drill. The problem of 
the school is to secure exercise or drill in such a way 
‘Phat pleasure results and easy mastery of the mechan- 
ies of reading is gained. Exercise to be satisfying 
and therefore effective must: 
1. Be recognized by the child as a necessary step toa — 
desired end. When the child feels the need of such 
drill for the accomplishment of his purpose, the 
“drive” is from within, consequently much effort 
is put forth, attention is concentrated}and mastery 
easily gained. Frank M. McMurry says: “The 
healthiest provision for motive in drill is found in the 
recognition of a given drill as a necessary step toward
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING 33 
the accomplishment of some already greatly desired 
end.” 
2. Be given after the thought has been secured and 
not before. After an introduction to a reading lesson 
has been given and a motive set up, the child’s mind- 
set is toward the answering of his purpose. Universal 
difficulties .should, therefore, be developed by the 
teacher before the child attempts to read, in order 
that his interest and ability in getting the thought will 
not be checked and annoyance, causing a dislike for 
reading, result. After the child’s purpose has been 
answered through reading, attention can then be given 
to fixing any universal or individual difficulty which 
the child has encountered. The mastery of these 
forms can be accomplished easily at this time, as their 
meaning has been secured and “ meaning alone fixes 
form.” 
3. Involve variety. Pleasure, interest, and attention 
are aroused through variety of ways of conductingy 
drills. The same kind of drill carried on day by 
day causes a decrease in interest and attention and 
therefore such drills are less effective. Games in- 
volving variety and the play spirit are one of the best 
means of securing effective drill. For suggestions see 
page 88. 
4. Be short. Concentration of attention is neces- 
sary for the successful carrying on of drills. To quote 
again Frank M. McMurry: ‘“‘ We must remember that 
even under the most, favorable circumstances, children 
: 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 HOW TO TEACH READING 
cannot long remain alert on subject-matter that lacks 
intrinsic interest. Drills, therefore, must be short.’” 
5. Bein as natural a situation as possible. One can- 
not learn to swim on land. Swimming bonds can 
be formed only in the water. This is true of all bond 
formation. Bonds must be formed and exercised in 
situations similar to those in which they are to be used. 
Isolated words are not met with in life, but are seen 
in context. Drill, therefore, should not be given on 
words presented in lists but in context. See, also, 
“ Eye-Span,” page 52, and “‘ Thinking,” page 35.

  CHAPTER IV 
HOW THE CHILD’S ABILITY TO GET THOUGHT IN 
READING CAN BE DEVELOPED 
“Reapine is thinking under the stimulus of the 
written or printed page.” If this important school 
subject is to be taught aright, ready knowledge of 
what thinking involves is necessary. Let us examine 
a common example of thinking. 
What thinking involves. Last summer you decided 
to attend a certain university. This decision was 
made voluntarily upon your part, because you felt 
the need of help in regard to the teaching of English. 
The problem then arose what courses you should take 
while at the university. You secured a catalogue 
and checked a number of courses which you thought, 
from the titles, might be helpful. More careful 
selection, however, had to be made, as you were 
allowed to take only three courses. To do this you 
read the synopsis of the different courses more care- 
fully, talked with people who had been at the uni- 
versity, and finally chose the three which seemed most 
promising. After reaching the university, you con- 
sulted with the professors who were to give the courses 
you had selected, to test the wisdom of your choice. 
The instructors asked you what you hoped to get 
from the courses and gave you a more detailed outline
-P-A-G-E-46
ee en ee ee 
36 HOW TO TEACH READING 
of points they expected to cover. Further testing of 
your selection followed in the taking of the courses and 
application of the help secured during your school 
work this year. 
Steps in thinking. In this illustration of purposeful 
thinking we find the following steps present: 
1. The problem of selecting helpful courses started the 
thinking process. 
2. You checked possible courses. 
8. You examined the courses checked and finally selected 
those which seemed to meet your needs most fully. 
4. You tested your judgment in the selection of courses 
by consulting the instructors, taking the courses, and 
applying the help received. 
These steps are present in all purposeful thinking 
of the simpler type. In a more complicated situation, 
the location of the problem comes between the prob- 
lem which started the thinking and the arising of 
possible solutions. 
Comparison of an adult’s and a child’s thinking. 
Let us examine a child’s thinking and see if the same 
steps are present. A box known to contain candy was 
placed on a shelf out of reach of a three-year-old child. 
The child stood on his tiptoes and found that he could 
not reach the desired box. He looked about and 
finally carried over to the shelf the footstool which his 
mother used when she watered the hanging plant. 
By standing on this he succeeded in getting the box 
of candy. In this common illustration we note: (1) 
The start of the child’s thinking, as shown by his 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  ABILITY TO GET THOUGHT ‘37 
activity, was the problem of securing the candy. 
(2) The child saw, as he looked about, various objects 
upon which he might stand to reach the coveted box. 
(3) He chose from among the objects the one which he 
had seen used in a similar way successfully. (4) He 
stood upon the footstool and tested the wisdom of his 
selection. 
When a more complete study is made of the process 
of purposeful thinking it will be found, as was shown 
in the above illustration, the following steps are 
present: 
1. A problem, question, state of doubt, or a forked-road 
situation, which must be met. 
2. The arising in the mind, due to past experience and 
prior knowledge, of possible solutions of the problem. 
8. The selection and development by reasoning of the 
most promising solution or solutions. 
4. The further testing of the selected solution in relation 
to the problem. 
While the same steps are present in the adult’s 
and child’s thinking we find the following differences:

Characteristic of problems that cause purposeful 
thinking. In the illustration of the selection of

courses to be taken at the university we find that the 
problem was initiated by the one desiring to attend 
the university. Sometimes, however, problems are 
suggested to us by others which we feel to be so worth 
while that we at once adopt them as our own. 
If the problem of selecting courses was suggested to 
one who was interested in a different line of work and 
who was not contemplating attending a university, 
this problem would not be adopted by that individual 
as his own and thinking would not result. The prob- 
lem of selecting courses to help particularly in the 
teaching of English was very definite so that more 
careful selection was necessary, and more pointed 
thinking resulted. 
If this identical problem were presented to the 
same individual day after day, interest would not be 
present, concentrated attention would not result, and 
thinking would not be necessary for its solution. All 
problems to stimulate purposeful thinking must 
present an element of newness. 
Problems to call for purposeful thinking, therefore, 
must possess certain characteristics. They must: 
1. Be initiated or adopted by the self. 
2. Be related to one’s experiences. 
3. Be definite. 
4. Have an element of newness. 
Tue Use or Motive Questions In Reaping 
If reading is to be thinking under the stimulus of

THE USE OF MOTIVE QUESTIONS 39 
the written or printed page, then the purpose, which 
is the start of all thinking, is of vital importance in 
developing the child’s ability to get thought in reading. 
As in thinking, the purpose or motive for reading will 
not only furnish the motive power for reading, but 
will guide the process, will be the basis for the selec- 
tion and organization of facts in relation to the pur- 
pose, and will constitute the goal or end point in 
reading. The purposes which motivate reading must: 
1. Be initiated by the reader, or if suggested by others the 
purposes must be so interesting that they are adopted 
by the reader as his own. 
2. Be related to the reader’s experiences in order that 
interpretation of the material may be possible. 
3. Be definite. 
4, Contain an element of newness. 
The same question used day after day in reading 
will not arouse interest. If the child is familiar with 
the material to be read, there can be no thought ques- 
tions used as motives for reading. The practice of 
telling the main ideas of the story, before the child 
is allowed to read, is, therefore, to be questioned. 
While familiarity with the content of reading material 
is necessary as an approach to reading, continued 
telling of the stories after a child has a working 
vocabulary of about fifty words is of doubtful value, 
as reading then cannot be thought-getting. We know 
ourselves how being told the plot of a story or play 
takes away from our interest in reading or seeing the 
production.
-P-A-G-E-50
    40 HOW TO TEACH READING 
The material, however, must be related to the 
child’s experience and must not present too many new 
words. As was suggested in Chapter III this material 
must be further related to the child’s experience 
through the use of an introduction. New and difficult 
words should be developed in sentences or phrases 
before reading is attempted. (See page 101.) The 
re-reading of material can be accomplished under the 
stimulus of different motives. (See page 21.) 
The amount of material read to answer a motive 
question will vary with the power of the children, 
the nature of the material, and the amount of time 
devoted to the reading period. As was seen in the 
illustration of the thinking of the little child, purposes 
cannot be held in mind a long time, but must be 
capable of being answered quickly. Therefore, with 
the little child in beginning reading, care must be 
taken that thought questions or motive questions of 
too large a scope are not given. 
In beginning first grade, subordinate thought ques- 
tions will need to be asked in addition to the motive 
question involving the main idea of the day’s lesson. 
At first, a thought question for each sentence is 
necessary. These should soon increase in scope so that 
a group of related sentences must be read in order to 
answer the question. Finally the child should be able 
to keep in mind the main question which will call for 
the silent reading of an entire story, division, or 
chapter of a story, without the use of any subordinate 
questions.

THE EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT . 41 
“Time spent by the teacher in studying the motive 
for a lesson or series of lessons is time well spent; the 
alert, attentive work of the pupils as they press for- 
ward under the stimulus of an appealing motive 
proves this.” ! 
Tue Exercise or JUDGMENT IN READING | 
In the illustration of the teacher selecting courses 
at the university to meet her need for help in the 
teaching of English, judgment played an important 
part in the third step of the thinking process, namely, 
the selection of the most promising courses. Evalua- 
tion of these courses was also required as she read over 
the synopses of the courses, and talked with various 
people about the work in order to make her final 
selection. Further weighing of the value of these 
courses in the light of her purpose was carried on in 
the fourth step of the thinking process, namely, the 
testing of the wisdom of her selection. 
Unless one has the ability to evaluate the worth of 
material read, reading, as thinking, cannot take place. 
Reading requires the ability to see relationships exist- 
ing between facts themselves and the relationship 
these facts bear to the purpose for which you are 
reading. Newspapers, magazines, and books present 
so many conflicting points of view that the reader 
must be able to discriminate between these, must 
evaluate them, and must make his own deductions.

Scribner’s Sons, publishers.

  42 HOW TO TEACH READING 
While the adult reader is able to select essential 
points in relation to his purpose and evaluate them as 
he reads, without experience and training, the imma- 
ture reader is unable to do this. The school, therefore, 
should provide such training in judgment that the 
habit of judging material will be formed. “‘ Good 
judgment consists largely in the proper appreciation 
of relative values; and since that is one of the very 
prominent factors in successful living, as well as in 
study, it is one of the most important abilities for the 
student to cultivate.” 1 
The use of judgment questions. Through the use 
of the motive, which provides the basis for the selec- 
tion and evaluation of facts, one provision for the 
exercise of judgment has already been made. The 
answering of motives which are of interest to the 
reader (the Law of Readiness) will cause such satis- 
faction to result (the Law of Effect) that judgment 
bonds are strengthened. Judgment and thought- 
getting can be further stimulated by the use of addi- 
tional questions given after the motive question or 
questions have been answered; such as: 
. Was this a good name for the story? Why? 
. Find or read the part that tells 
. What was the main idea in that paragraph? 
. What ought you to know in order to appreciate this 
story more fully? 
5. Could we use this story or poem at our Easter enter- 
tainment?   >

Tue OrGANIzATION OF MarteriAt IN READING 
In order that the ideas gained from reading may be 
used — that is, “turned to account in the accom- 
plishment of purposes, whatever they may be, or made 
to function in one’s daily adaptation to physical, 
moral, and religious environment” !— it is necessary 
that the reader be able to organize the material read. 
Organization of ideas in reading is necessary because: 
1. Greater insight into facts is gained as the relationships 
between facts are more clearly seen. 
2. Duplications and omissions are avoided. 
3. Memory is assisted as more thought associations are 
formed. 
4. Ready command over facts is gained, so that the use of 
them is facilitated.

mission of the publishers, Houghton Mifflin Company.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  THE ORGANIZATION OF MATERIAL 45 
Training in organization is another means, then, 
by which the child’s ability to get thought can be 
developed. 
The motive question. The thought question, used 
as a motive for reading, should bring out the heart of 
the story. Large points leading up to the main point 
of the story should be brought out through the use of 
questions. After the material has been read in rela- 
tion to thought questions, questions should be asked 
which call for the re-reading of larger groups of related 
sentences or the reproduction of the main ideas in 
them. Such questions could be used as: 
. Tell me what you saw in the first picture. The next. 
. How many pictures do you see in the story? Name 
them. 
. Read me all the sentences that tell 
. How many characters are necessary to play the story? 
Into how many acts would you divide this story? 
. To illustrate this story how many large pictures would 
you have to make? Draw them. 
. Make out questions calling for the main points in the 
story. 
8. Make an organization of the story to help in the 
reproduction.

acter? Prove that you are justified in using these 
adjectives.

have we found so far?

The lesson assignment. The character of the lesson 
assignment will largely influence the type of organ- 
ization which results. In the use of geographical 
material for reading lessons, if the assignment is to 
find out all that is given in relation to the location, 
size, climate, and product of a country, relationships 
of facts will not necessarily be seen, but mere pigeon- 
holing of facts will result. This is not organization. 
Tf, on the other hand, the assignment is to discover 
“Why is England a manufacturing country rather 
than an agricultural one ?” facts in regard to location, 
size, climate, and products will be gained, but in 
addition the relationships of these facts to each other 
and to the activities of man will be seen. 
“read 
pages 6 and 7,” or “take the next selection in the 
book,” there is no basis given for the selection of facts 
and all facts will be considered of equal value. 
The number and type of questions asked. The 
number and type of questions asked by the teacher is 
another important factor in giving the child the ability 
to organize and get thought from his reading. The If the assignment of a reading lesson is to
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE RIGHT TYPE OF DRILL 47 
number of questions necessary to bring out organiza- 
tion of subject-matter will depend upon the power of 
the child and the nature of the material being read. 
More questions will necessarily have to be asked in 
dealing with reading in the lower grades in order to 
check whether thought has been gained and because 
ability to hold larger units of thought in mind comes 
with training and experience. The teacher, however, 
should use questions of as large a scope as the child 
can handle. If the teacher’s questions call merely for 
reproduction of isolated facts, neither the ability to 
organize nor the ability to think will be developed. 
The conduct of the recitation. Organization is 
defeated when the selection is read paragraph by 
paragraph or the teacher tells the children when to 
begin and when to stop, often breaking the thought 
in so doing. The amount that each child reads should 
be-regulated by a thought question. The child should 
be held responsible to judge how much should be told 
or read to answer a question. 
Tue Rieur Type or Drain 
Drill either promotes or hinders the development of 
thinking. ‘‘ Mechanical drill may give results most 
quickly and yet strengthen traits likely to be fatal to 
reflective power.” 1 Drill of the right type, however 
(see page 32), which emphasizes the thought side 
rather than the form side, aids the child in the ability

-P-A-G-E-58
    48 HOW TO TEACH READING 
to get the thought from his reading and also gives the 
necessary command over the mechanics of reading. 
In order that the thought side may be emphasized, 
drill upon new and difficult words should be had in 
their context. Instead of calling for the child to point 
out the word “ black,” have him find in the sentence 
the word that tells of what color the cat is. 
The judgment and organization questions already 
given furnish much drill on the thought side. In 
addition other questions or directions may be used; 
such as: 
. Find the part that tells 
. Find all the “old friends” on this page. 
Read the sentences in which they are found. 
Read the part that gave you trouble. 
. Find the part that is most difficult. 
Find the word as many times as it occurs. 
. See if you can read conversational parts more as the 
characters said them. 
. Find all the sentences that are about 
. Find a sentence which tells an important fact and then 
read all the sentences which lead up or grow out of 
such a sentence. 
10. Read review lessons with different motives.

CHAPTER V 
HOW THE CHILD CAN GAIN COMMAND OVER THE 
MECHANICS OF READING 
A cuHitp cannot get thought from his reading, no 
matter how great his desire or love for reading may 
be, unless he has command over the mechanics of 
reading. In order that we may be able to help the 
child gain this mastery, it is necessary for us to know 
what the complex process of reading involves. 
Tue Work or THE Eyer 1n READING 
While the average adult is unconscious of the move- 
ments of his eyes in reading, recent experiments have 
shown us the value such knowledge may be to a 
mature reader, in showing him how to increase his 
own efficiency in reading. Such knowledge is also 
fundamental to one who is helping children form 
correct habits of reading. It makes it possible for 
one to decrease the eye-strain caused by the artificial 
reading process and to increase the speed of silent 
reading. 
Scientific investigations, made possible through the 
use of delicate mechanical apparatus, have shown the 
following facts in regard to the work of the eye in 
reading: 
1. The eye moves in a series of sweeps or jerks across the
-P-A-G-E-61
THE WORK OF THE EYE 51 
page from left to right, returning to the beginning of 
the next line in an unbroken sweep. Seeing or reading 
takes place during the fixation pauses which occur be- 
tween these jerks or sweeps. The number of fixation 
pauses is determined by the nature of the material, the 
purpose for which it is read, and the individual’s rate 
of reading. 
2. Almost the entire reading time is consumed by the 
periods of fixation. 
3. We are limited in the amount we read during fixations 
because of the structure of the eye and the inability of 
the mind to interpret but so many unrelated impres- 
sions at once’) The reduction of the number and dura- 
tion-of fixations is of great importance in reducing 
eye-strain and increasing rate of reading. The number 
of fixation points can be reduced by the widening of 
the recognition span; that is, the amount of material 
taken in during one sweep of the eye. 
4, Regressive movements of the eye causing refixations, 
‘are due to: 
a. The return sweep of the eye, failing to carry the 
fixation back to the first word in the line, and thus 
an additional refixation is necessary to make the 
initial part of the line clear. 
b. Lack of word knowledge. 
c. The failure to get a clear perception of the mean- 
ing, and so the eye moves back and forth over the 
part that causes the difficulty. 
5, With fairly uniform material, the eye falls into a 
rhythmic habit of moving across the lines making 
approximately the same number of fixations per line. 
' The greatest practical use of this knowledge should 
be made by the teacher of beginning reading in order 
that right habits may be formed from the first. 
Remedial measures, based upon these facts, will be of 
value where bad habits of reading have been formed. 
In developing habits of right eye-movements in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
52 HOW TO TEACH READING 
lower grades the following suggestions should be kept 
in mind: 
1. Silent reading must precede any attempt to read aloud 
-in order that, 
a. Attention may not be divided between the inter- 
pretation of the thought and its expression. 
b. The number and duration of fixations is greater 
in oral reading. Visualization is impeded in the 
case of oral reading by the more cumbersome 
process of vocalization. 
. Beginning reading should proceed from a sentence or 
group of sentences to the phrase, then the word, and 
finally the phonetic elements. 
. New and difficult words, taken in the phrases or sen- 
tences in which they occur should be developed before 
silent reading is attempted in order that: 
a. Interpretation of thought may not be checked. 
b. The rhythmic movements of the eye may not be 
interrupted. 
ec. The number and duration of fixation pauses may 
not be increased. 
d. Regressive movements may not be required. 
. The use of the introduction and motive question caus- 
ing interest, attention, and mind-set will tend to pull 
the eye along and aid in quickness of interpretation, 
thus decreasing the number and duration of fixation 
pauses. 
. Drill on words should be in conteht: not in isolation, in 
‘order that: 
a. Meaning may help fix the form of words. 
b. The habit of taking in as much as possible at & 
single glance be not weakened. 
The form in which the material is expressed is of vital 
importance in aiding the formation of good eye-move- 
ments. The following points should be observed: 
a. In beginning reading the lines should be short and 
of uniform length in order that the rhythmic 
habit of eye-movements can be established. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  HOW WORDS ARE PERCEIVED 53 
b. In beginning reading phrases should not be broken 
at the end of the line, as this would tend to cause 
regressive eye-movements. 
c. In beginning reading words should not be sepa- 
rated unduly, as the length of the perceptual span 
would be decreased. 
d. In beginning reading words should not be thrown 
into relief by the use of colored chalk, as the 
number of eye-sweeps will be increased. 
e. Lines should not be broken by pictures. 
f. The size of the type, the space between the lines, 
and the illumination should be regulated by the 
maturity of the children. 
g. The paper used for reading material should be 
thick, unglazed, and cream-white. 
How Worps are PERCEIVED IN READING 
The psychologists have not only discovered what 
constitutes the work of the eye in reading, but also 
how words are perceived. A child learns to recognize 
an object, as a house, by its general form. He does 
not see at first that it is composed of so many doors, 
windows, and roof. So in the recognition of a word, 
it is the general form which causes its recognition. 
The distinct charagter of ‘a word is determined by the 
letters of which it is composed, the most significant 
of these being the first letters in the word and the 
extended letters. These are called ‘“ determining ” 
or “dominating ” letters. The upper half of the 
word is more important in word recognition than the 
lower half. The length of the word does not regulate 
its difficulty, in fact variation in length makes word 
recognition easier.  
-P-A-G-E-64
— eee 
54 HOW TO TEACH READING 
Perception in reading is not limited to words. 
Phrases and short sentences can be recognized as 
} quickly as a single word. This depends upon the 
| width of the perceptual span which can be greatly 
, increased by proper training. Experiments have 
proved that quick perception of as large units as pos- 
sible aids in grasping the meaning of material. As 
has been stated, perception occurs during the fixation 
process. 
The perception that occurs therein is of two kinds, foveal 
and peripheral. The area that can be grasped by foveal 
vision in any one fixation is relatively small. Only about 
five letters will be “unequivocally clear” when the eyes are 
held quite stationary. The adjoining letters will not be so 
sharply defined, but will shade off gradually into a hazy 
outline, growing fainter and fainter as they recede from the 
foveal area. These letters are grasped only by peripheral 
vision. The area of peripheral vision is consequently much 
larger than that of clear vision. The number and duration 
of pauses per line and the speed of reading in general are 
thus seen to be conditioned toa considerable degree by the 
effective utilization of extra-foveal vision.! 
To develop peripheral vision and enlarge its area 
in order that habits of effective reading may be de- 
veloped the following points must be observed: 
1. A short sentence should be the smallest unit presented 
to the child in beginning reading. Later, attention 
may be called to its phrases, words, and finally parts of 
words. 
2. Little or no attention should be paid to the “little 
words”; such as the, and, in. These words have no 
characteristic form and have no definite meaning.

HOW WORDS ARE FIXED 55 
8. Pointing to individual words during the reading process 
should be condemned. 
4, Drill should not be given upon words in isolation, but 
in context. 
5. Phrase cards rather than word cards should be used for 
drill. 
6. In blackboard and chart work, the motor sweep of the 
arm under phrases or short sentences helps in increas- 
ing the visual span. 
'. The child’s mind should be prepared for the material 
he is to read through the use of an introduction and 
motive. 
8. Difficult words should be developed in sentences or 
phrases before the child attempts to read. 
9. Silent reading should always precede oral reading. 
10. Words presenting similarity in general form should 
not be developed in the same lesson. 
How Worps are Fixep 
In order that the reader may be able to recognize 
the words so unconsciously that attention can be 
centered on the interpretation of their meaning as they 
fit into the material at hand, words must be presented 
many times. “The process of learning words in the 
early reading exercises will be facilitated by presenting 
them in sentences or longer passages, and by con- 
centrating attention on the meaning of what is read.” ! 
It must be remembered that, while recognition of the 
word is through its dominating letters, meaning alone 
fixes the form. 
In order that the meaning of the word may be

cation. Published by the Public School Publishing Company.

    56 HOW TO TEACH READING 
instantaneously recalled when the word is perceived, 
the factors conditioning recall must be known and 
utilized. The native power of memory cannot be 
changed, as it is due to the original nature of brain 
tissue. The skill with which one uses whatever 
power he has, however, can be greatly modified. 
The two factors which condition the recall of a fact 
are: 
1. The number of associations or clues which it has. 
2. The depth of an impression. 
Number of associations. Provision for number of 
associations, to be made through thinking, should pre- 
cede any attempt to fix the material by means of drill. 
Numbers of associations between the word and its 
meaning can be formed by presenting the word in 
many different situations rather than having drill 
upon the word in a single situation. This can be done 
through the use of: 
1. Blackboard and chart units involving the use of the 
word in different settings. 
. Supplementary reading material.

Le In order for drill to be effective: 
The conditions under which the drill is carried on must 
be as normal and lifelike as possible. ‘‘ Practical skill, 
modes of effective technique, can be intelligently, 
non-mechanically' used only when intelligence has 
played a part in their acquisition.” ! 
. The child should have a motive for learning the mate- 
rial which will insure interest and concentrated atten- 
tion. This motive may be: 
a. Recognition of the given drill as a necessary step 
to gain a desired end. 
b. Emulation. 
c. Self-competition. 
d. The desire to codperate. 
e. Natural interest in the subject-matter. 
f. To answer a purpose or felt need. 
. Drill must be individual in character. It must be . 
conducted as nearly as possible according to each 
child’s needs and particular abilities. 
. Frequent repetitions should be had shortly after the 
material has first been developed. 
. The periods should be short and make use of the play 
instincts of the child. 
. No stated amount of repetition should be required, but 
each should be held responsible under the guidance of 
the teacher to determine the amount of repetition and 
time he needs to spend upon a lesson in order to recall 
it. This the child can do by forming the habit of re- 
calling the material by questions he asks himself. 
. Use should be made of the Law of Effect. 
“A feeling of satisfaction should accompany every 
drill period and a feeling of discontent should follow 
every unsuccessful effort. It must be quite generally 
conceded that responses, or reactions, in order to be 
often repeated, must be pleasant to the performer, and 
it is equally true that unsuccessful or unpleasant re-

sponses tend to be sloughed off, or eliminated. One of 
the chief characteristics of successful drill work is 
repetition, not meaningless, thoughtless repetition, but 
clear-cut, vivid, and interesting repetition. If a feel- 
ing of dissatisfaction or annoyance accompanies a 
series of efforts, it will not be often repeated. Now, if 
this repeated activity is to be voluntarily realized, 
which, of course, should be the case, only one alter- 
native remains open for the educator: namely, make 
drill work interesting in itself. Let the results of the 
activity be an incentive to further effort. Let the 
process of the development of skill be inviting to the 
learner. Pleasure brings success, and success spurs the 
learner on to greater effort, while unpleasant duties or 
activities have a depressing and retarding effect.” + 
For ways of conducting drill see page 48. 
Hasits or Arrackine New Worps 
The child must not only have the ability to recall 
the meaning of words already developed, but he must 
have the ability to attack new words in order to get 
the meaning and pronunciation. It has already been 
advocated that the teacher in the lower grades, 
after introducing the lesson and setting up a motive 
for reading, develop the universal difficulties involved 
inalesson. In this way it is possible to set a standard 
for the child’s attack on new and difficult words. 
The following ways of attacking new words should 
be developed: : 
1. Skipping over the word and trying to get its meaning 
through context. This is probably the most universal

  HABITS OF ATTACKING NEW WORDS 59 
and economical way used in life. The child should be 
held responsible for the use of this method throughout 
all grades. In order that this habit may be established, 
it is necessary to present words in context and not in 
isolation. (See lesson plan, page 186.) 
Recalling the situation in which the word was previ- 
ously used. While this method would sometimes be 
used in any grade, its chief use would be in beginning 
reading. Sometimes the teacher would recall the situa- 
tion in which the word was used orally and sometimes 
she would write the sentence or a portion of the sen- 
tence involving the use of the word on the board. 
Using phonetic power already developed. Children 
in all grades should be held responsible for the applica- 
tion of phonetic elements that have been developed. 
(For the development and use of phonics, see Chapter 
VIL) 
. Making use of the pronouncing vocabulary found in 
the back of the reader. From the third grade on, 
children should be held more and more responsible for 
determining their individual difficulties and making 
use of the most efficient ways of mastering these. The 
teacher, however, must be sure that the children have 
conquered their difficulties. The pronouncing vocabu- 
lary is an excellent preparation for the use of the 
dictionary in the upper grades. 
. Using the dictionary. Few people use the dictionary 
effectively. Definite training should be given in the 
use of the dictionary by teachers in the upper grades. 
This training to be effective should be given when 
occasions arise and not apart from children’s needs. 
(For suggestions, see page 74.) 
. Asking for words from classmates and teacher. When- 
ever the child has exhausted all independent means for ‘ 
the mastery of words, he should ask for help from the 
teacher or classmates.

CHAPTER VI 
HOW THE CHILD CAN INCREASE HIS SPEED IN 
READING 
Since the literature in practically every field is now so 
voluminous that none but the fastest can hope to cover any 
considerable portion of its extent, it may be safe to say that, 
other things being equal, a person’s efficiency in his profes- 
sion will be largely proportional to the rapidity with which 
he can gather the thought from the printed page. An in- 
crease of speed in silent reading will, therefore, not only 
effect an appreciable economy of time and effort in the work 
of education, but it will increase the efficiency of both the 
pupil and the adult. It will, moreover, satisfy a keenly felt 
human want. For there are probably few persons who have 
not, at some time or other, felt themselves aglow with the 
insatiable longing to penetrate deeper into their chosen field 
of labor, to make themselves masters in their field by assim- 
ilating the written thought and knowledge of the masters 
who have gone before. A considerable increase in speed of 
reading is the one effective instrument which will aid them 
in the realization of their desire.! 
As speed in reading is of such fundamental import- 
ance in the work of education and in life, the school 
must be responsible for giving that training which will 
develop a reasonable degree of speed. Speed in read- 
ing is conditioned by the following factors: 
1. Concentration of attention. 
2. Increase of the perceptual span. 
8. Avoidance of vocalization in silent reading. 
4. Control over words.

  62 HOW TO TEACH READING 
5. Ability to grasp the meaning. 
6. Right habits of eye-movements. 
CoNncENTRATION OF ATTENTION 
Much of the time seemingly spent in reading is 
occupied by the mind wandering off into bypaths, 
some of which are suggested by the material and 
others which are the result of mere day-dreaming. 
This fluctuation of attention causes a great waste. 
Economy of time in reading can be obtained by 
eliminating this fruitless wool-gathering and securing 
sustained attention. While we can force ourselves or 
be forced by others to give concentrated attention 
for a short time, sustained attention can be secured 
only as a result of interest. 
As has already been developed, surrounding children 
with reading material suited to their individual inter- 
ests, needs, and experiences will stimulate them to 
become interested in reading. The mind-set and 
readiness caused by the use of an introduction and 
motive for reading are additional factors in securing 
interest and attention. When a child has a purpose 
for reading of sufficient interest, this purpose not only 
furnishes the drive or motive power for reading, but 
guides the process and keeps the mind occupied with 
the purpose until the end point is reached. This 
eliminates much of the mind-wandering likely to occur 
when no motive or specific purpose for reading is set 
up, and therefore an improvement in speed results.
-P-A-G-E-73
ae 
CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION 63 
In the lower grades, speed should be secured largely 
by having the child become interested in forming 
habits which promote speed, such as reading with a 
purpose, eliminating lip, head, and finger movements, 
rather than centering the child’s attention on speed 
itself. The desired speed can be secured in this way 
without the dangers of careless habits of reading and 
nervousness resulting. 
In the upper grades, after desirable habits of read- 
ing have become in a measure fixed, the child’s atten- 
tion should be directed toward acquiring a certain 
degree of speed as an additional motive in reading. 
In order to have the child interested in acquiring a 
desirable speed in reading, the following means are 
suggested: 
1. Having the child’recognize the value of rapid reading. 
This can be done by: ; 
a. Allowing the child who has finished first to record 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. the order in which the pupils in his row finish the 
reading. 
Permitting children who finish rapidly to read 
other selections. 
Choosing the rapid readers as leaders of small 
groups. y 
Allowing them to become time-keepers when ; 
speed tests are given. 
Permitting the children who have finished to 
engage in other desired activities. 
2. Using the individual and class graph. (See page 25.) 
3. Pressure of time control. 
The pressure of time control is an effective means of 
securing speed in reading, provided that it is carried 
on in such a manner as to protect the careless reader 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
and the nervous child. Whenever the pressure of time 
control is used, the thought must be carefully checked 
so that speed will not be secured at the sacrifice of 
comprehension. Conducting all exercises with the 
game spirit prominent will protect the nervous child. 
When desirable, the excessively nervous child may be 
excused from the exercise or placed as time-keeper. 
The following ways may be suggestive for using the 
pressure of time control: 
a. After the lesson has been introduced, a motive 
for reading set up, and, if necessary, universal 
difficulties dealt with, the children can be in- 
structed to open their books at a given signal and 
read until they find the answer to the question. 
Some signal which will indicate when the child 
has finished reading should be decided upon in 
advance. This signal should be of such a nature 
that the attention of the rest of the group is not 
distracted by its use and their speed retarded. 
The raising of the hand or the closing of the book 
can be used to advantage. 
The time can be kept in the following ways: 
(1) By the teacher. 
Have on the board or on paper the follow- 
ing time intervals: 
Dseesto 16'secs. 5... 84 
16 sec. to 30 sec... ... 
81 sec. to 45 sec...... 
46 sec. to 60 sec.. 
As the child finishes, write his name 
after the appropriate time interval. 
(2) By the children. 
Select children who have reached the 
desired speed to serve as time-keepers. 
Have one for each row. The time-keeper 
keeps a record of the order in which the 
children in his row finish. At the end of 
each time interval, as, 15 sec., 30°sec., etc.. 
the teacher in a low voice says to the 
time-keepers, “Time.” The time-keepers 
    
-P-A-G-E-75
INCREASE OF THE PERCEPTUAL SPAN 65 
then draw a line under the names already 
on their papers, thus indicating the time 
intervals. Then the scores of the class 
may be placed upon the board, chart, or 
each individual child may record his own 
score. 
Following the keeping of the time the 
thought should be carefully checked by 
having: 
(a) The main ideas given in the child’s 
own words. These may be written 
or given orally. 
(b) The planning of a dramatization. 
(c) Illustrations. 
(d) Questions. 
These questions may be given 
orally by the teacher, written on the 
board and uncovered after the 
children have finished reading, or 
given out in multigraph form. 
b. After the lesson has been introduced, a motive 
given for the reading, and, if necessary, universal 
difficulties dealt with, the children can be in- 
structed to begin reading in response to a given 
signal by the teacher and to mark lightly with a 
pencil the word they are reading when the teacher 
says, “Stop.” Each child then counts the num- 
ber of words he has read in the given time. A 
record of the scores can be kept on the board, 
charts, or each child can keep a record of his own 
rate. These scores can also be made into indi- 
vidual or class graphs. The comprehension of 
the material should be carefully checked we any 
of the ways previously mentioned. 
IncREASE OF THE PERCEPTUAL SPAN 
As has already been discussed, the width of the 
perceptual span is an important factor in securing
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 HOW TO TEACH READING 
comprehension and speed in reading. It aids in com- 
prehension because larger thought units are seen 
during a fixation pause and thus assimilation is fa- 
cilitated. 
The ultimate goal of reading is to secure meaning from the 
printed page in large thought units. The smallest possible 
unit of thought is the word, while the most common 
units are phrases. As long as a reader is unable to grasp 
these thought elements in a single recognition his men- 
tal processes are interrupted by the necessity of piecing 
together the material to make up meaningful elements. 
Speed is increased by the widening of the percep- 
tual span because fewer fixation pauses are necessary 
and the length of the fixation pause is decreased. In 
easy reading material the assimilation of the matter 
seems to occur as soon as the printed symbols are 
perceived. 
The width of the perceptual span can be increased 
by: 
1. Using interesting material. 
2. Introducing the material and setting up a purpose for 
reading. 
~8. Developing the universal difficulties in phrases. 
4. Avoiding too much oral reading. 
5. Having little or no drill on isolated words, but calling 
for phrases involving difficult words. 
6. Using short sentences or phrases for quick exposure. 
7. Avoiding pointing to individual words in beginning 
reading.

  AVOIDANCE OF VOCALIZATION 67 
AvoIDANCE oF VOCALIZATION IN SILENT Reapine 
All the experiments in regard to the influence of 
inner speeca in the reading process show that lip 
movements retard the rate of reading. The relation- 
ship between inner speech and comprehension has not 
been established. Whether the tendency to use the 
lips during silent reading is an acquired or natural 
habit, this tendency should be decreased or eliminated 
as rapidly as possible. By the end of the second grade, 
there should be few, if any, lip readers. All auditory 
sounds accompanying silent reading should be avoided 
from the first. The following means are suggested, 
for the elimination of lip movements: 
1. Not having all material read aloud even in beginning 
reading. 
“The origin of vocalization in most cases can proba- 
bly be traced to oral reading. Having become ac- 
customed to the process of oral reading, many children 
employ the same laborious process in silent reading, 
though not allowing the oral expression to become 
audible. Instead of proceeding directly from the sym- 
bol to the idea expressed, they tend to give it oral 
expression first.” + 
The need for oral expression can be eliminated by: 
a. Having the children do what the sentence or 
sentences tell them. 
b. Having the children tell the substance of a para- 
graph in their own words. 
c. Have the children tell what the paragraph was 
about and not give the substance. -

d. Having the children illustrate, cut, or model the 
thought contained in the sentence or group of 
sentences. 
2. Selecting interesting and easily understood material. 
8. Having thought and word preparation precede the 
reading. 
4, Having the children feel the advantage of rapid read- 
ing and see the relationship existing between their lip 
movements and their rate of reading. 
5. Having the children become conscious and check their 
own lip movements by placing their fingers on their 
lips while reading. 
6. Directing pupils to read as much as possible in a given 
time without moving the lips. 
ConTROL OveR Worps 
The material chosen to develop speed in reading 
should not present too many strange or new words or 
be difficult to comprehend. Increasing the number of 
difficulties increases the number and duration of eye- 
fixations, so speed is retarded. 
In order not to retard the rate of reading, it is well 
to take up the universal difficulties before reading is 
attempted. This also gives the child standards for 
the independent mastery of words. (See Chapter V, 
page 59; Chapter VIII, page 101.) 
Asiuity To Grasp THE MEANING 
The rate of reading is also conditioned by the 
ability of the mind to grasp the meaning of what is 
read. For further treatment of this topic and practi- 
cal suggestions see Chapter III, page 19.

  CHAPTER VII 
HOW THE CHILD CAN BE HELPED TO USE THE 
TOOLS OF READING EFFECTIVELY 
AN efficient workman in any field is dependent upon 
a good equipment. He must have accurate knowledge 
of his materials and the ability to use them skillfully. 
We do not expect a carpenter to be able to do a good 
piece of work unless he is equipped with excellent 
tools. He must be able to select from his kit that tool 
which will produce the best results and must also have 
the ability to handle it skillfully. 
The efficient reader is dependent upon a good equip- 
ment. His tools are books of many types, magazines, 
and newspapers. His efficiency likewise depends 
upon thé accurate knowledge of his tools and the 
ability to use them skillfully. The reader must know 
where to go to find the information he needs and he 
must be able to locate it as directly and quickly as 
possible.” 
In order to help the child to use the tools of reading 
effectively, it is necessary that he be given good mate- 
rials with which to work. He must know the different 
features of books, magazines, and newspapers and 
must form the habit of using them skillfully. 
In making use of any of these tools of reading, 
the child constantly meets new or unfamiliar words. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  TRAINING IN THE USE OF BOOKS 71 
The ability to identify these as quickly as possible is a 
fundamental necessity for efficient reading. New or 
unfamiliar words can be mastered by skipping over 
them and identifying them through context, looking 
them up in word lists or glossaries, asking other people, 
and by identifying them through the knowledge of 
phonies. 
TRAINING IN THE Errective Use or a Book or 
Macazing 
Table of contents. Through the table of contents 
one can ascertain the nature of the book, the subject- 
matter contained in it, and where to find the material. 
The use of the table of contents, then, is desirable to 
find material quickly and avoid useless search for 
material. 
The habit of using the table of contents should be 
acquired by the child’s constant use of it as occasions 
arise and not in isolated drills. Beginning in the IA 
Grade the children should be taught to make use of 
the table of contents in finding the selections to be 
read. In order to avoid unnecessary waste of time, 
it is often best for the teacher to call attention to the 
classification of the table of contents, and sometimes 
it is advisable for the teacher to tell the children under 
which heading the story will be found. Attention 
should be called to the fact that, in finding a selection, 
one should glance at the first part of the titles in the 
table of contents to see if they correspond to the first 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
72 HOW TO TEACH READING 
part of the title for which they are looking. It is 
not necessary nor advisable to read every title in its 
entirety. 
Word list or glossary. Beginning with the Third 
Readers, lists of difficult words are often found either 
at the end of each selection or at the back of the book. 
The children should be shown how to use these lists 
as an additional aid in the mastery of difficulties. 
To accomplish this the children’s attention should be 
called to the alphabetical arrangement of the words. 
In looking up words, not only the first letter of the 
word has to be observed, but even the second and third 
in order to know where to find the words quickly in 
the word lists. Real needs for such work will arise 
almost daily in the reading or geography periods. 
In the first and second grades, the sounds of the 
consonants and vowels should be developed._In the 
third grade, use should be made of the diacritical 
marks to indicate the long and short sounds of the 
vowels. In the fourth grade, the recall of the two 
sounds of c, g, and s, and the long and short sounds 
of the vowels with their appropriate diacritical marks, 
must be made in order for the child to interpret the 
respelling of the words in the glossary. The child 
should be taught to make use of the pronouncing key 
for the interpretation of all other. diacritical marks. 
While the children’s attention should be called to 
the accent mark, the teacher should help them in 
stressing the proper syllable, as it is difficult for chil-
-P-A-G-E-83
  TRAINING IN THE USE OF BOOKS % 
dren to place the accent where it belongs when pro- 
nouncing written words. 
Chapter headings. Children should be made con- 
scious of the function of chapter headings. The 
organization questions which should be used in all 
grades will aid in the understanding of chapter head- 
ings. The many situations which arise for the use of 
chapter headings should be utilized to give the neces- 
sary training for the use of this important feature of a 
book. 
Marginal headings. The children’s attention 
should be called to the function of marginal headings. 
They should form the habit of relying upon these, as 
marginal headings are most helpful in the use of 
encyclopedias and all reference books. 
Index. In the use of histories, geographies, and 
some reference books, the habit of consulting the index 
should be established. This will avoid the useless 
search for material and prevent waste of time in locat- 
ing the knowledge or information desired. While the 
table of contents is arranged according to the sequence 
of the chapters or large topics as they occur in the 
book, in the index the material is classified more in 
detail and arranged alphabetically. When individuals 
or small groups are assigned special topics, they should 
be taught to consult the index of books in order to 
find the desired information as quickly as possible.
-P-A-G-E-84
  14 HOW TO TEACH READING 
TRAINING IN THE Errective Use or A Dictionary 
The small dictionary. Through the use of the 
word list or glossary the child will become familiar 
with the alphabetical arrangement of words, the use 
of diacritical marks, syllabication, and accent. This 
training can be utilized in dictionary work. Sufficient 
drill can be secured by utilizing the needs for looking 
up words in the dictionary as they occur in all sub- 
jects of the curriculum. This practice occurring in 
natural situations and motivated by a real need is 
more effective than any amount of isolated dictionary 
drill. In addition to the skills acquired in the use of 
word lists, the following features.of a dictionary must 
be developed: 
1. The use of running titles. Emphasize the use of 
running titles for securing speed in looking up words. 
The children should know that the word above the 
first column is the first word on the page; the word 
above the second column is the last word on that 
page. Children should form the habit of relying upon 
these. 
2. Preferred pronunciation. In the glossaries or 
word lists, only one pronunciation is given. In the 
dictionaries two are sometimes found. The child 
should be taught that the first pronunciation given is 
the one preferred. 
3. Meaning of words. The children should consider 
the different meanings given and decide by a study of
-P-A-G-E-85
  
TRAINING IN THE USE OF A DICTIONARY 75 
the context which is the “ meaning that fits.” In the 
grammar grades, the knowledge of the parts of speech 
should be used as an additional aid in selecting the 
right meaning. The child should know the abbrevia- 
tions used for the different parts of speech. 
4. The singular form. Children should be taught 
to look for the singular form of nouns. 
5. The key to pronunciation. The children should 
be taught to use the key to pronunciation which is 
found at the bottom of the page. 
The large dictionary. In the grammar grades, the 
pupils should be encouraged to use the large diction- 
ary for information not contained in the smaller edi- 
tion. The pictures, diagrams, geographical and bio- 
graphical names found in the unabridged dictionary, 
are especially helpful. The children should be taught 
where and how to find these. 
Attention should be called to the fact that probably 
all the words the child needs to look up will be found 
above the black, horizontal line that divides the page. 
Only unusual and obsolete words are found below the 
line. The child should be taught to look below the 
line on the same page when unable to find the word 
above the line. 
The child should continue to use the small diction- 
ary for the meanings of words, as the unabridged edi- 
tion has so many definitions that confusion is likely 
to result.

At the present time not enough scientific studies 
have been made to establish the relationship between 
phonics and efficiency in reading. The excessive 
amount of phonics taught in the past, and the sub- 
ordination of thought content to the development and 
use of phonetic elements, have rightly caused this 
subject to be discredited. The extensive use of 
diacritical marks in reading material also proved more 
of a hindrance than a help in reading. A six-year 
child, when presented with material in which all 
phonetic elements were marked, said, “I can’t read 
this story. It is so marked up.” 
Care should be taken that these mistakes of the 
past do not cause the pendulum to swing too far the 
other way and result in the discarding of a tool which, 
if used intelligently, will prove an asset rather than a 
liability in the teaching of reading. There seems to 
be little question “that phonetic training is needed 
for foreign children not only to develop a method of 
attacking new words, but to sharpen auditory per- 
ception and develop speech coérdination.” ! 
There is no doubt that the development of phonetic 
elements should be given in a period apart from the

reading period. Attention during the reading period) 
should be centered upon the thought content and 
should not be shifted to the mechanics of reading. 
“Tf the basic training in the analysis of words is given 
during phonic periods, the information thus received 
can be applied quickly and effectively during read- 
ing exercises without withdrawing attention from the 
content of what is read.”’! 
While the actual value of phonics has not been 
determined, many educators feel that if phonics is 
taught in a reasonable amount and if the material 
selected has a direct bearing upon the reading in 
hand, the child will be helped in both reading and 
speaking. 
I. The Value of Phonics 
Phonics when taught correctly has the follow- 
ing values. It helps the child: 
1. In the identification of new words. 
The ability to attack new words enables the 
child to get the thought more rapidly and 
makes him independent of the teacher’s help. 
Some children seem unconsciously to associate 
certain sounds with the symbols that represent 
them. Others must be taught how to do this; 
that is, they must learn phonics. 
2. In enunciation and pronunciation. 
The ability to recognize the sound of certain 
symbols as et in get, atch in catch, ing in doing, 
makes the child better able to pronounce.cor- 
rectly and enunciate clearly these words which 
are so commonly miscalled.

mission of Public School Publishing Co.

TRAINING IN PHONICS 79 
8. In the development of speech codrdinations. 
Many children seem to be unable to give 
certain sounds correctly. This may be due 
to physical reasons or bad habit formation. 
These bad habits, caused by the child being 
allowed to continue baby talk, imitating the 
| incorrect sounds which he hears others use, or, 
hearing inaccurately, may be corrected by 
means of phonics. 
II. The Subject-Matter of Phonics 
The subject-matter of phonics, considered as a 
tool subject, consists in: 
1. Sounds and symbols of consonants. 
a. Consonants made with breath: 
f, h, k, p, 8, t, wh, th (as in thin) 
b. Consonants made with voice: 
b, d, g, j, l, m, n, 7, 0, w, y, 2, th (as in them) 
2. Phonograms consisting of vowels and conso- 
nants. 
8. Rules governing the sounds of vowels and 
consonants. 
III. The Basis for the Selection of Subject-Matter 
If a child is to use phonics as a means of helping 
him primarily in the identification of new words, 
then those elements must be selected and developed 
which will be met with most frequently in his read- 
ing. The order in which the consonant sounds and 
phonograms are developed will be determined by the 
material read. There is no value, and waste of time 
results, when phonic elements are developed which 
will be used seldom or only in the remote future. 
IV. Points to be Kept in Mind in Developing Phonics 
1. Eye-training in phonics should not be begun too 
soon. The order of development in reading is 
from a sentence or a group of sentences, to phrases  
-P-A-G-E-90
80 HOW TO TEACH READING 
to words. Therefore, attention directed toward 
words or parts of words until the time when it is 
necessary to keep the word units clear is detri- 
mentai. (See Eye-Movements, page 50.) 
. Ear-training should precede eye-training. Ear- 
training is a necessary preparation for the analysis 
of words. It sharpens auditory perception and 
causes the ear to be sensitive to correct sounds. 
. Only those phonetic elements should be selected 
for development which the child will need to use 
frequently and in the immediate future. 
. The child should feel the relationship between 
phonics and the other subjects. Greater con- 
centration of attention results when the child 
realizes that phonetic ability helps him: 
a. To attack new words. 
b. To interest others whenever he speaks or 
reads aloud because he is able to enunciate 
more distinctly. i 
ce. To spell correctly in all his written work the 
regularly formed words. 
(See Laws of Learning, page 19.) 
No word should be used in the phonetic period 
whose meaning the child does not know. “Mean- 
ing and form combine to make the percept of the 
words clear, therefore, phonics should not be ap- 
plied without the aid of meaning.”’ See page 55. 
. “Phonics should be taught systematically and in 
a period distinctly apart from the reading lesson. 
If such studies are made during the regular read- 
ing period there is danger that attention will shift 
from the content of what is read to the study of 
individual words.” 1 During the reading period, 
however, the child should be held responsible for 
the application of phonetic elements already 
developed. 
Attention should be given to individual needs. 
Not all children will need the same amount of

training or training on the same elements. It is 
a waste of time to require children to spend their 
time upon phonetic elements they know for the 
sake of a few children who are having difficulty. 
Children with serious speech defects should be 
given special training. 
. No use should be made of diacritical marks ex- 
cept the marks to indicate the long and short 
sounds of the vowels. These should be taken up 
only when the child needs them in order to inter- 
pret the word lists. ‘To require children to learn 
the greater part of the possible diacritical marks 
is to put upon them a useless and difficult task.” 
. Each grade should be held responsible for the 
development of certain phonic elements and for 
the correction of specific common errors of speech. 
In pronouncing words, never allow the child to 
break the words up into their séparate sounds.

following points should be kept in mind in pho- 
netic games: 
a. Individual work stiould be steed: Little 
or no concert work should be allowed. 
b. The work of each child should contribute to 
the good of the group. 
c. Many children should take part in the game. 
d. Words, whose meaning is not known, should 
not be taken, as meaning and form combine 
to make the percept of the word clear. . 
e. Children should receive the individual 
training they need.

Q. Eye and voice training. 
a. To develop phonograms: 
Method I 
Teacher: I am thinking of a word that sounds like 
cake. (Teacher writes cake on the 
board.) We use it in the garden. 
What is it? 
Child: Rake. 
Teacher: (Writes rake on the board directly under 
the word cake.) I am thinking of another 
word that sounds like cake. We like to 
row onitinthesummer. What is it? 
Child: Lake. 
Teacher: (Writes this word on the board under

  SUGGESTIVE METHODS 85 
the word rake.) I am thinking of 
another word that sounds like cake. It 
is what mother has to do to you in the 
morning. What is it? 
Child: Wake. 
Teacher: (Writes it on the board.) Who can find 
the part of these words that is alike? 
(Children show it by framing ake with 
their hands.) We call this a family 
name. What does it say? 
Child: Ake. 
Teacher: (Writes ake above the list of words.) 
Find the word in this list that we use in 
the garden. 
The teacher should ask thought questions call- 
ing for the other words. (See Games for ways of 
fixing these words, page 88.) Methods IV, V, 
and VI, making use of rhyming words, may be 
used in a similar manner to develop eye-training 
and the various phonograms. A variety of games 
should be used to fix the phonograms. 
Method II 
The teacher says, “Tell me all the words you can 
think of belonging to the eat family.” | (This 
phonogram has already been developed as in 
Method I.) As the children give the words, the 
teacher writes them under the phonogram eat. 
No word is accepted whose meaning is not known. 
The words are stressed which the child will meet 
in his reading. Games can be used to fix the 
elements. 
Method III 
The teacher asks the children to give her all the 
words they can belonging to the ing family, which 
has already been developed as in Method I. As 
the child gives the word, the teacher asks him 
how to spell the word and writes it on the board.
-P-A-G-E-96
86 HOW TO TEACH READING 
No word is accepted whose meaning is not known. 
The words are stressed which the child will meet 
in his reading. Games can be used to fix the 
words and phonograms. 
b. To develop initial sounds: 
Teacher: Name all the objects you can think of 
beginning as box does. 
Child: Board. 
The teacher writes the word board on the board. 
She writes the different words given by the 
children until she has such a list as the following: 
box board ball book bat bank 
Teacher: What sound do all these words begin 
with? Who can find the part of the 
word that says b? (Writes the letter b 
above the list.) Find your word in the 
list. Tell me how it begins and give me 
the word, Mary. 
Mary points to and gives the sound of b and 
pronounces the word bat. 
Various games may be used to fix the words 
and sounds. (See Games, page 88.) Methods I, 
Il, I, IV, V, making use of initial sounds, may 
be used in a similar way. A variety of games 
should be used to fix the sounds. 
8. The use of phonetic charts and cards. 
After the different phonograms have been developed, 
it is well for the teacher to print the list of words given 
by the children in large type on heavy tag board. 
These charts are valuable because: 
a. They make permanent the list. 
b. They give an opportunity for the children to add 
to this list words found in their reading lessons 
which belong to the same family. 
c. They give greater opportunity for dealing with 
individual needs and make possible the playing 
of a greater number of games. 
Such charts made by the teacher are more valuable
-P-A-G-E-97
  SUGGESTIVE METHODS 87 
than any ready-made charts that can be procured, as 
they are better adapted to the actual needs of the 
classroom. 
In the development of an initial consonant sound, 
children may bring in pictures of objects whose name 
begins with the sound being developed, as h. The 
children may cut these pictures out, select the best, 
arrange them artistically, and mount them on the class 
chart of kh. Individual books can be kept in the same 
way. 
Cards with the phonogram or initial sound on one 
side and the key word, or a word belonging to this 
family which is most familiar, on the other, can also be 
used to advantage. Words belonging to these families 
may be printed on separate cards and used in games. 
‘These words should be printed in large type or written 
with a large black crayon. 
. Rules. 
To develop the rule that final e lengthens the preced- 
ing vowel, the teacher reviews the phonograms ate, ive, 
ove, ame, etc. 
Teacher: With what letter do all these families end? 
What other vowel do you see in the fami- 
lies?) What sound do they have? What 
does ¢ at the end of a family or word 
make the vowel preceding say? (Apply 
this knowledge to other phonograms and 
words that end in e.) 
Other rules should be developed in like manner from 
the children’s experience. No attempt should be made 
to formulate rules until near the end of the second 
grade. 
5. Application of phonics. 
a. In reading. 
(1) When developing universal difficulties, the 
teacher calls attention to known phonetic 
elements or has the children find these. 
(2) The child should form the habit of attack- 
ing a word by noticing the initial conso-
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 HOW TO TEACH READING 
nant sound and looking for known phono- 
grams. Says Miss Jenkins: “The larger 
the known units recognized in a word, the 
greater the economy.” 
(3) In having children skip over words to 
identify them through the context, atten- 
tion called to the initial sound of the word 
will often aid in its identification. i 
(4) In the check-up of reading, such questions 
as the following are often used to fix 
difficulties: 
(a) Find the word that tells what the 
Little Red Hen did to the bread 
(made). What part of the word do 
you know? (ade, m.) 
(b) Find all the words on this page be- 
longing to the ake family. 
(c) What words on this page begin with 
the sound f ? 
(5) In looking up words in a word list or dic- 
tionary, the children should be taught to 
apply their knowledge of phonics.   
6. In spelling and written language. 
In spelling and written language children should be 
held responsible for the spelling of all regularly formed 
words built upon known phonograms. 
Puonic GAMES 
1. Have cards with a word on each belonging to several 
different families. As the teacher points to a word on 
the board, let the children find the corresponding card. 
2. Distribute cards with different words on them belong- 
ing to a certain family. Call for them by meaning, as: 
“What does mother do to our food before we eat it?” 
f (Cook.) 
8. Let two of the children stand away from the board 
with erasers. Have words written on the board. 
Some child tells a word and the children see which one
-P-A-G-E-99
5. 
  PHONIC GAMES 89 
can find the word and erase it first. Instead of stating 
what the word is, its meaning might be given. 
. Attach a string to all cards having words on them. Put 
the cards in a deep container, bring the strings together 
in a bunch and have children draw, telling the word 
on the card drawn. Have the child, who draws the 
word being emphasized, for the winner. 
Have cards and a chart with many familiar words on 
it. Hold up the card on the side that has the family 
name. ‘What family is this? Give me a word be- 
longing to the ake family. Find your word on the 
chart.” If the child does not recognize the family, 
turn the card and show him the key word. 
. Distribute word cards to the pupils. Have two alike. 
Allow two children with cards unlike to pass around 
the room in search for the duplicate of his card. As 
the child passes each desk, he must read each child’s 
card. The owner of the card is responsible for the 
correctness of the reading. The one that finds his 
partner first wins. 
. Write words belonging to various families on the board. 
Give each row of children a family name. Let the 
first child in each line find a member of his family and 
draw a line under it. Then let those in the second seat — 
go up as soon as the first one in his row is seated and 
choose another member of the family. The row wins 
that gets its whole family first. 
. Have the child show a word on the board that begins 
with a certain consonant sound. Let this child call on 
another child to give words beginning with that sound. 
. Have cards with words belonging to different families 
on the blackboard ledge. Have children find words 
belonging to a certain family. When they have found 
a word, they form a line in front of the class and tell 
their word. Have words corresponding to the cards 
written all around on the boards. The children who 
have the cards must find, match, and tell the word on 
the board corresponding to their card. When all the 
words have been found, each child then gives his card 
to some one else.

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
The teacher thinks of a word belonging to the ook 
family. A child guesses what the word is, does not tell 
the word, but gives a hint as to what it is; as, “Is it 
something a man wears?” Another child tries to 
guess the child’s word and the teacher says whether it 
is correct. 
One child is outside of a circle of children. He taps 
a child on the back. ‘‘Who taps?” demands the one 
tapped. He replies, “The word bright,” and asks, 
“What family does it belong to?” If answered cor- 
rectly, he takes the child’s place in the circle. If 
answered incorrectly, he goes into the circle and the 
other one taps somebody else. 
Distribute a number of phonograms. Give one child a 
consonant. Have him get all the phonograms that 
he can use to make a word. Have the words made 
pronounced. 
Write words on the board. Distribute phonograms 
and consonants to the children. Point to a word and 
ask the children who have the parts of that word to 
come to the front of the room. 
Distribute a number of phonograms, and after each 
child has looked at his have them placed face down on 
the desks. Give a child a consonant. Have him ask 
a child, “Can I make a word with your card?” The 
child answers, ““Yes, you can make with my 
card.” The first child says, “Then you must have 
on your card.” 
Distribute cards half with phonograms on them and 
half with consonants. The children holding the 
phonograms are on one side of the room and those 
holding consonants are on the other. Have the first 
child hold up his card and ask a child on the other side, 
“Can you make a word with my card?” If the other 
child can do so, he says, “Yes, I can make 7 
This is to count for the first side. The second side now 
has a turn, and so on until all the children have tried. 
The side with the highest score wins. 
Write phonograms on the board. Distribute con- 
sonants to the children. Have all children come to the

  GROUP WORK 91 
front of the room who, by adding their consonant to the 
phonogram indicated, can make a word. The words 
made should be stated. 
Group Work 
Small groups can be used effectively to fix the 
phonetic elements which have been developed in class 
work with the teacher. (See Group Work, page 121.) 
The following games may be played in the small 
groups: 
1. Have various words belonging to different families on 
cards. Give two words to each child. Let each child 
draw a card from the child in front of him. If he suc- 
ceeds in getting two of the same family, let him turn 
his cards face down on the desk. After all the children 
draw, let the children with two cards of the same family 
come to the front of the group and say the name of 
their family and the words. Those who do not match 
cards may try again. 
2. Have the children choose a word beginning with the 
sound of d. The first child says, “‘I am going to Bos- 
ton. Iam going to take a »” mentioning a word 
beginning with d. The second child says the same 
thing, mentioning the word the first child is going to 
take plus his own. The third child mentions both the 
things the others are to take adding to them his own 
word which should also begin with d. 
8. Place phonograms around the blackboard ledge. Give 
children different consonants. Let the children run 
up to the board, select a phonogram which with their 
consonant will make a word, tell the word, and, if best, 
use it in a sentence. Scores may also be kept. 
4, This game is like “Authors.” Word cards are passed 
out containing words based on phonograms. Each 
child in turn asks some one in the group for a card he 
wants which belongs to the same family to which his   
 
-P-A-G-E-102

NAME w o HOW TO TEACH READING 
word belongs. If he gets the word he asks for, he gets 
another turn. Whoever gets six cards in his family 
first, wins the game. In asking for a word, he may 
vary his questions. He may ask for a member of the 
at family, or he may ask for a word that sounds like cat. 
. Draw a large square hop-scotch on the board. Let the 
children give words belonging to a certain family and 
the teacher puts one in each square of the hop-scotch. 
Let one child try to go all around the hop-scotch nam- 
ing the words. If he succeeds, let him put a second 
word in a square. The next child will have to name all 
the words. Scores may be kept. 
. Distribute a number of phonograms. Give two 
children consonants and see which can make the most 
words. Be sure to have words given after all the cards 
are obtained. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. What features of a book or magazine should a child be taught 
how to use? Why? How can this be done? 
. What training should be given in the use of a newspaper? 
Why? 
. How can effective use of a dictionary be secured? 
. What are the values and dangers in the use of phonics?

PART III 
SILENT AND ORAL READING 
CHAPTER VIII 
HOW THE CHILD CAN BECOME A GOOD SILENT 
READER 
Tur VaLur or Sitent Reapine 
In Chapter I the importance of reading in life was 
shown. Reading is the means by which one satisfies 
his desire to know, increases his vocational efficiency, 
finds enjoyment in life, satisfies his suppressed desires, 
gains a fuller understanding of life, and secures ideals 
and standards for the guidance of his own life. The 
type of reading most used to accomplish these aims is 
silent reading; seldom, if ever, is oral reading required. 
Silent reading is a universal daily experience. The 
adult and the child outside the classroom reads books, 
magazines, newspapers to gain the thoughts and ideas 
,expressed in them and not for oratorical purposes. 
The educational world is at last fully alive to the 
fact that if it is to train pupils for the activities of real 
life by having its own activities duplicate as nearly 
as possible the conditions of life, lant in silent 
reading must receive greater emphasis than that of 
oral reading. Standard ‘ests have revealed the fact 
that life demands have not\been met by the training 
\ 
x
-P-A-G-E-104
    94 HOW TO TEACH READING 
given in oral reading. Training in silent reading is 
~ now possible because of greater psychological knowl- 
edge of the reading process and the wealth of good 
silent reading material available. Educators are 
stressing silent reading because: 
1. It gives training in the type of reading most used 
in life. 
2. It is more economical in point of time, eye- and 
voice-strain. 
When a reader finds it necessary to read aloud, to 
pronounce whole sentences and clauses to get the 
thought, his energy is being dissipated. 
Our own experiences as well as investigations made 
prove that silent reading is a much more rapid process 
than that of oral reading. Vocalization, involving all 
the mechanisms of speech, cannot keep pace with the 
rapidity of eye-movements which alone are involved 
in silent reading. 
The eye makes fewer fixation pauses in silent reading 
than in oral reading, and so the strain upon the eye is 
lessened. Imagine the strain upon the voice if all 
one’s reading were done orally. 
8. It aids in comprehension. 
Silent reading is not only a more rapid way of 
reading, but it is superior in point of comprehension. 
Attention in silent reading is entirely given to the 
interpretation of the meaning of the symbols, but in 
oral reading attention must also be given to articula- 
tion and enunciation. The greater speed with which
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE VALUE OF SILENT READING 95 
material can be brought to the mind is also a factor 
that aids in comprehension. Because of the ability 
to take in larger units, organization of the material 
which aids in comprehension is facilitated. 
4. It admits of selectiveness. 
In silent reading each individual can select that 
portion of the material that is of most interest to him. 
He can browse over these portions and take time to 
react to the thoughts aroused. This provides for the 
development of individuality as well as silent reading 
ability. 
5. It allows one to develop his own rate of reading. 
The average variation in rate of oral reading is 
much less than that of silent reading. Individuals 
vary enormously in their rate of silent reading. Silent 
reading, therefore, gives greater opportunities for the 
development of individuality and individual rate of 
reading than does oral reading. 
6. It gives training in the kind of reading most 
necessary for the development of other subjects. 
It has been found that children’s failures in geog- 
raphy, history, and arithmetic are often due to their 
inability to comprehend the thought of the material 
read. Children trained in oral reading alone have 
difficulty in understanding the statement of problems. 
They are unable to select, organize, and make use of 
the material which is necessary for the solution of 
problems in history and geography and so they resort 
to memorizing the exact words of the book. In the
-P-A-G-E-106

upper grades much time and attention should be given 
to the interpretation of factual material through silent 
reading. 
v Hasrrs, Skirts, AND APPRECIATIONS TO BE 
DrvELOPED THROUGH SILENT READING 
In order that the child may become an efficient 
silent reader, certain habits, skills, and appreciations 
must be developed. While each grade should be held 
responsible for definite accomplishments, all grades 
should be working toward the realization of the fol- 
lowing general objectives: 
1. To create a desire and love for reading. (For means of 
accomplishing this objective see Chapter III.) 
2. To help the child through the process of thought- 
getting to master the mechanics of reading. (For 
suggestions see Chapter V.) 
8. To develop the power to think clearly and to the point. 
(For suggestions see Chapter IV.) 
4. To read with the individual’s maximum degree of 
speed. (For suggestions see Chapter VI.) 
5. To furnish opportunities for the child to make use of 
the ideas gained from the printed page. (For sugges- 
tions see Chapter IV and Between-Recitation Periods, 
page 117.) 
6. To train in the effective use of books. (For suggestions 
see page 71.) . 
Typrs or MATERIAL For SiteNt READING 
While, with all types of material, silent reading 
should as a rule precede any attempt to read aloud, 
some types of material should rarely if ever be used 
for oral reading purposes. This is material of the
-P-A-G-E-107
THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 97 
factual and informational kind found in newspapers, 
magazines, and materials used in other subjects, such 
as history, geography, nature study, and hygiene. 
Even literary material has many passages of this 
informational type which could to advantage be 
expressed in the child’s own words rather than read 
aloud. A great variety of material of a factual and 
informational nature should be used in order that 
effective training may be given. 
Tue Tracuer’s CAREFUL PREPARATION FOR 
THE Lesson 
Habits, skills, and appreciations necessary for good 
silent reading cannot be formed by the children them- 
selves, but. are dependent upon the skillful guidance 
and control of the teacher. In order to develop the 
right habits in children, the teacher must have a 
scientific knowledge of the reading process, and the 
principles underlying habit formation. This knowl- 
edge she must make practical use of in a careful prep- 
aration for each lesson in reading. In preparing a 
lesson in silent reading the teacher must know: 
1. The needs of the group. 
2. The material selected to meet the neeiy of the group. 
3. How to use the selected material. : 
The needs of the group. The teacher’s knowledge 
of the needs of her group will be the basis for: 
1. The selection of the material. There should be a 
wealth of material available from which good silent 
& 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
98 HOW TO TEACH READING 
reading material can be selected. Besides the silent 
reading material found in basal and supplementary 
books, excellent material can be selected from news- 
papers, magazines, home reading, library reading, 
and the subject-matter of other studies of the curri- 
culum; as, history, geography, hygiene, nature study, 
agriculture, problems in arithmetic, recipes in domes- 
tie science, directions for the making of things in 
manual training, and handwork. In the lower grades 
blackboard lessons furnish good silent reading material. 
2. The grouping of children. Unless the class is 
well graded, division into small groups is advisable. 
This division into groups may be based upon varia- 
tions in interests, rate of reading, ability to compre- 
hend, and habits which need to be established. After 
certain standards of silent reading have been estab- 
lished by the class through the use of uniform material, 
different material can be selected for the various 
groups and used by them during the recitation and 
the between-recitation period. (See page 121.) 
3. The follow-up work. The follow-up work which 
should come after the recitation will be determined 
by the individual, group, and class needs. If the 
material is worth while for one lesson, it can probably 
be used to advantage in several lessons, provided it is 
used in a variety of ways and not merely re-read. 
The material selected to meet the need of the group. 
In addition to knowing the needs of the class, it is 
necessary that the teacher have a knowledge of the
-P-A-G-E-109
THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 99 
material that is to be used in order that she may help 
‘the children form desirable reading habits. She 
must know the leading thought of the selection and 
its main divisions. On the basis of the organization 
of the material and the ability of the class, the teacher 
should determine the amount to be developed in the 
lesson. 
How to use the selected material. The teacher 
must not only know the needs of her group and be 
familiar with the material selected to meet these 
needs, but she must also make careful preparation in 
order to make effective use of this material with the 
children. The following steps are suggested for the 
use of silent reading materials: 
A. Preparation. 
* 1. Introduction of the material. 
As was developed in Chapter III, the function of 
the introduction is to make the child interested 
and eager to read the material. (Law of Readiness.) 
The recall of the experience through the introduc- 
tion makes it possible for the child to interpret the 
material. The teacher must determine what ex- 
periences the children have had which will make it 
possible for them to get the meaning of the selection 
and which would arouse interest. The necessary 
experiences may be given or recalled through the 
use of: 
a. Excursions. 
b. Real objects brought into the classroom. 
c. Pictures. 
d. Stories or poems. 
e. Conversation. 
The teacher must select from the above means 
the one best adapted to the material to be used.

-P-A-G-E-110
100 HOW TO TEACH READING 
This introduction must be short and lead directly 
into the heart of the story or the portion of the 
selection to be used at that time. In reading con- 
tinued material, the introduction may consist of a 
question calling for the main points which have 
already been ascertained and are significant for the 
reading of the new material. Care should be taken 
that the introduction should occupy not more than 
two or three minutes of the recitation. (See Lesson 
Plan, page 186.) 
. Motive for reading. 
Too great emphasis cannot be placed upon the 
necessity of having a motive question for silent 
reading. (See Chapter IV, page 39.) This motive 
question set up by the teacher, or by the children 
themselves, should be a direct outgrowth of the 
introduction. The clear pointed wording of the 
purpose or motive question is of fundamental im- 
portance because of its effect upon thinking and 
reading. It is sometimes advisable from third 
grade on to have the motive question or purpose 
written on the board. It should not be written or 
uncovered until the children are ready to read 
silently. Care should be taken that motives in- 
crease in scope according to the reading ability of 
the children. (See page 40.) 
The teacher in planning for the lesson must de- 
cide what motive is best suited for the material. 
This is true whether the teacher gives the motive 
or through her introduction stimulates the children 
to set up a motive for reading. The following 
motives for silent reading may be suggestive: 
a, To answer a question to. bring out the main 
idea of the story; as, in “An Order for a 
Picture,” by Alice Cary, to find out what the 
poetess wanted painted in the picture. 
b. To-answer.questions which call for the main 
thoughts; as, in the story of the “Golden 
} Fleece,” who gave King Midas the power of
-P-A-G-E-111

the golden touch? Why did he wish to rid 
himself of this power? How was the golden 
touch removed? 
c._To select a story best suited for dramatization 
d. 
e orreproduction-for_some_stated-oceasion. 
To formulate questions-te-asktheirclassmates. 
These questions.to-call_for.the main ideas. 
To. criticize or make marginal headings, name 
chapters or_divisions of stories. Prove that 
is a good name for this story. What 
would be a good name for this chapter of the 
story?   
f. To judge the character of people in the selec- 
tion; as, ‘Why was the Cratchits’ dinner a 
success?”’ “Why had the Great Stone Face 
a different effect upon Ernest from that of the 
other seemingly great men of the valley?” 
. To evaluate characters in a story or selections 
in a book; as, ‘“‘Why are the King Arthur 
stories excellent ones to put in your readers?” 
. To tell the most interesting portion of a story 
in order to influence classmates to read it. 
To be able to criticize the thought or language 
of a selection. 
. To determine the logical consistency of a line 
of argumentation. 
. To be able to report to the class or group on a 
certain phase of the activity or problem. 
To be able to report on current events and 
bring in clippings to prove their points. 
. To report on library books read. 
. To be able to give a brief synopsis of a story 
up to where oral reading is begun. 
. To discover new problems in regard to a 
problem or project. (For additional motives 
see page 23.) 
8. Mastery of universal difficulties. 
In the lower grades universal difficulties should 
be mastered before silent reading is attempted 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
because of their effect upon interest, comprehen. 
sion, speed, and eye-movements. 
The teacher must select the universal difficulties 
in the lesson to be presented and determine how 
they should be developed. Only those difficulties 
should be dealt with at this time which will give 
trouble to the major portion of the class. The 
teacher should deal with the individual difficulties 
during the silent reading period. The child who 
has trouble with the words should be the one called 
on to work out the word. 
The words involving difficulties should be written 
on the board in the phrases in which they occur in 
the material. In presenting these phrases the 
teacher should begin a sentence orally which the 
phrase on the board will complete. (Care should 
be taken to use such sentences as will not give away 
the essential features of the story.) The children 
should be held responsible for completing the sen- 
tence which the teacher has begun by working out 
the written phrase. This they should be helped to 
do by: : 
a. Skipping over the difficult word and getting 
it through the context. 
b. The use of phonics. The teacher may at first 
need to point out familiar phonetic elements; 
later the children should be held responsible 
for finding these themselves. 
ec. The recall of a basal sentence in which the 
word has occurred. 
d. Asking the teacher the word. Proper names 
and words not needed in the permanent 
vocabulary of the child at this time should be 
told them. 
In the upper grades this step would be omitted 
because the children should be held responsible for 
determining their difficulties and solving them by 
means of the habits established in the lower grades 
and by the use of the pronouncing vocabulary in 
the reader and the dictionary.
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 108 
4. Standards of reading to be kept in mind. 
In order that definite habits of good silent read- 
ing be developed, it is advisable for the teacher to 
have the children recall the habits which they, as 
individuals, or the group as a whole, need to keep in 
mind and to exercise while reading. These habits 
may be: 
a. How to get new and difficult words. 
b. To avoid lip, head, and finger movements. 
ce. To take in as much material as possible at one 
glance or sweep of the eye. 
d. To care for the book properly by: 
(1) Holding it in right relation to eyes and 
light. 
(2) Turning the pages from the top right 
hand corner. 
e. To make use of the essential features of the 
book as: 
(1) Table of contents. 
(2) Pronouncing vocabulary. 
(3) Appendix. 
(4) Index. 
(5) Bibliography. 
(6) Marginal and chapter heading. 
(7) Preface. 
. Recall of the motive. 
Sometimes, when considerable time has been 
consumed in the development of difficulties, the 
motive for reading needs to be recalled at this time. 
. Material given out or found in the book. 
The material for silent reading should be that 
with which the children are unfamiliar. For this 
reason the children should not be allowed to take 
home or read during school hours basal and 
supplementary material which is to be used for 
class purposes. The children may be allowed to 
take home or read during odd moments one set of 
supplementary readers and library material. In 
order that the selections may be new to the chil- 
dren, many teachers have found it advisable to
-P-A-G-E-114
104 
B. 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
keep the material and pass it out when they wish 
the children to use it. The children should not 
have access to the material while the previous steps 
are being developed, as it detracts from interest and 
attention. As soon as possible the children should 
be taught to find the selection through the use of 
the table of contents, thus establishing one habit in 
the use of the book. 
Silent reading. 
While the children are reading silently, the teacher’s 
attention should be given to helping them with their 
individual difficulties and seeing that the habits recalled 
in Step A, 4, are being exercised. Her attention should 
also be given to diagnosing the reason for certain chil- 
dren’s lack of comprehension and speed. 
The teacher should begin the check-up of the silent 
reading as soon as the major portion of the class has 
finished reading. The children who have not finished 
should be allowed to do so at some future time. Their 
attention should also be directed to the reasons why they 
were unable to finish with their classmates. In this way 
they will be spurred to renewed efforts and feel the need. 
of forming certain definite habits which influence speed. 
. Check-up of the silent reading. 
The check-up is one of the most important as well as 
the most difficult steps in silent reading. As a result 
of this period, appreciation of the meaning of the mate- 
rial should be enhanced and enlarged, ‘comprehension 
checked, and difficulties mastered. These canbe accom- 
plished by the use of skillful thought questions given by 
teacher and pupils. These questions will consist of: 
1. The motive question. 
This will mvolve a grasp of the main idea of the 
selection. 
2. Questions checking the main points and important 
details. 
3. Judgment questions. 
These will cause the children to think through
-P-A-G-E-115
    THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 105 
the material in order to make certain deductions, 
will bring out appreciation of character, the 
author’s style and choice of words, and will cause 
ideals to be formed. (See Chapter IV, page 42.) 
. Organization questions. 
These questions will bring into relief the main 
ideas in their proper sequence, appreciation and 
comprehension will be aided, greater command over 
the material will be secured and thereby use will be 
facilitated. (See Chapter IV, page 45.) 
. Questions calling for oral reading. 
Questions calling for oral reading may be given 
to prove: 
a. The validity of a statement in answer to a 
thought question. 
b. Character delineation. 
c. The beauty of certain passages. (See Oral 
Reading, page 135.) 
. Questions involving the use of difficulties. 
Many of the thought questions already suggested 
should aid in the mastery of both individual and 
class difficulties. In the lower grades additional 
thought questions may be given which will call di- 
rectly for the picking out of the difficulty and the 
mastering of it. (See page 48.) 
In the upper grades children may be asked: 
a. What words have given them difficulty. 
b. The meaning of such words, phrases, or allu- 
sions. 
c. The use of the difficult word in another sen- 
tence. 
d. The use of a synonym. 
In the lower grades smaller and more numerous 
questions will be necessary in order that meaning 
can be checked and difficulties can be mastered. As 
the child’s power increases, the questions should 
increase in scope and diminish in number. More 
responsibility should also be placed upon the chil- 
dren for the asking of thought-provoking questions 
and discussion of the material.
-P-A-G-E-116
106 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
Variety in the check-up of silent reading. 
Variety of procedure is necessary in checking 
silent reading. The nature of the material and the 
way it is to be used should regulate the type of 
check-up. Every type of procedure, however, 
should make use of questions calling for facts, 
judgment, organization, and drill on difficulties. 
The 
a. 
Cc following procedures may be suggestive: 
Planning for a dramatization. 
After answering the motive question, the 
teacher might ask the children how many 
characters would be necessary to play the 
story, and the names of these; the places, and 
properties necessary; the number of scenes 
required; and the conversation the different 
characters would use. This work and the 
selection of children to take the parts of the 
different characters, and the choice of places 
in the room for the various scenes constitutes 
an excellent test of the child’s comprehension 
of the material. (See lesson on page 259.) 
. Preparing an organization for the reproduc- 
tion of the story. 
After the motive question has been an- 
swered the teacher could ask the children to 
determine the number of large pictures or 
divisions of the story; name them, or state the 
main thoughts of these. Then the children 
should determine what should be told under 
each of these main divisions or pictures. 
Formulating thought questions on the mate- 
rial. 
After the motive question has been an- 
swered, the children could make out thought 
questions to ask one another. These should 
include fact questions, judgment questions, 
organization questions, and drill on difficul- 
ties. These questions could be discussed 
under the guidance of the teacher or in small 
groups. —
-P-A-G-E-117
PROCEDURE IN THE RECITATION 107 
d. Selecting main thoughts in answer to a ques- 
tion. 
‘When using geographical or historical mate- 
rial, the teacher could give a question which 
would call for the selection and organization 
of the main points of the material and their 
necessary details. The discussion of these 
answers would be an excellent check of this 
material. 
D. Follow-up work. 
When much of the recitation time is spent in establish- 
ing correct reading habits and in checking the thoughts 
gained in silent reading, care should be taken to. make 
further use of the material. The nature of the material 
will determine what this use should be. If it is primarily 
oral reading material, another recitation period may be 
necessary to give adequate training in oral reading. 
This re-reading, however, should be in relation to some 
need. Groups can practice reading aloud portions of the 
material, taking the part of different characters, or 
dramatizing the story. If the material is primarily that 
of the silent reading type, the children in the lower grades 
can illustrate, cut, or model the main ideas of the story, 
its characters or incidents. 
The follow-up work then may involve the use of the 
same material: 
1. In another recitation period using a different 
motive. (See Types of Recitation Periods, page 110, 
and Oral Reading, page 136.) 
2. In the between-recitation period; as: 
a. Individual work (see page 117). 
b. Group work (see page 125).

order that monotony be avoided and concentrated

The teacher introduces the lesson and gives the 
motive for reading. Difficulties are developed and 
standards of good silent reading are set up. The 
motive is now recalled, the material is passed out 
and the selection found through the use of the table 
of contents. 
Silent reading by the children. 
During this time the teacher is making note of 
improvement various children show, giving indi- 
vidual help when needed in the mastery of word 
difficulties and the overcoming of bad habits. 
Sometimes the teacher keeps a record of the child 
and the word he has difficulty with in order that 
during the check-up she may find out whether the 
child has really mastered the difficulty. 
The check-up. 
After answering the motive question, the teacher 
asks thought questions to check the silent reading 
ability of the children and to fix the mechanics of 
reading. See page 104 for the different types of 
thought questions. 
Depending upon the nature of the material, the 
follow-up may be any one of the following given 
during another period:

Check-up. 
After answering the motive question, the children 
make out and ask one another a series of thought 
questions. These questions should bring out the 
main points and important details; include judg- 
ment and organization questions, and check the main 
difficulties. It is advisable to do this under the 
guidance of the teacher in order that standards of 
what constitutes a good check-up of silent reading 
can be established. It will also make possible in- 
telligent independent group and individual work of 
the same kind. This type of work will give train- 
ing of inestimable value in forming correct study 
habits needed in history, geography, and language.

namely, to find out whether this story would be a 
good one to reproduce on that occasion and why. 
Standards of good silent reading are recalled if 
necessary.

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
Type 7 
(Geographical or historical material) 
Preparation. 
The teacher recalls the problem which has arisen 
in the geography or history work and which be- 
comes now the motive for reading. Different sup- 
plementary material is given to the members of the 
class. 
Silent reading. 
The teacher gives individual help in the use of the 
book and in the selection of material pertinent to 
the problem. 
Check-up. 
Individuals report upon the material they have 
found, the rest of the class judging the value of their 
contributions. Sometimes it may be well for the 
children to read extracts from the material to prove 
their points. 
The follow-up work. 
During a between-recitation period or the geog- 
raphy or history period, the children select and 
organize the material in relation to the problem, the 
teacher giving help as needed. 
Type 8 
(Using library material) 
Step A and Step B. 
Step C. Step A and Step B have already been accom- 
plished. Each child has chosen and read silently 
some library book with the purpose in mind of giv- 
ing such a report upon the book that the rest of the 
class will desire to read it. 
Check-up. 
Small groups form, and each child makes his book
-P-A-G-E-125
  PROCEDURE IN THE RECITATION 115 
report. The other members of the group may ask 
questions to clear up points, may make or have 
additional points given. Each group selects the 
child making the most interesting report to appear 
before the class and try to interest the members of 
the class in the book he has been reading. 
Step D. The follow-up. 
During the recitation period, when the reports 
from the small groups are given before the class, 
the class criticizes the reports, asking questions 
which they want cleared up or having additional 
points given. 
Type 9 
(Re-reading material with a different motive) 
Steps A and B. Preparation and silent reading. 
Step C. A need has arisen for a story to be told on a spe- 
cial occasion. The teacher has assigned two or 
three selections, which have previously been taken 
up in class, to be re-read in order to select the best 
one for reproduction. This re-reading by the 
children has already been done in a between-recita- 
tion period. 
Check-up. 
In the recitation period the children form into 
small groups and decide upon the best story. The 
class forms and each leader gives the decision of his 
group. The story having the greatest number of 
votes is selected and organized by children and 
teacher for the reproduction. 
Step D. The follow-up work. 
  In a between-recitation period small groups form 
and each child practices telling the story. The 
child telling it the best in each group is chosen to 
appear before the class. The class decides who will 
tell it upon the special occasion.

How to Make ProriraBLe THE BeTWEEN- 
Recitation Prriop 
Many bad habits of study can be traced to the 
conduct of the between-recitation period. The edu- 
cational world at last realizes that this period affords 
unusual opportunities for the development of indi- 
vidual study habits and for the development of social 
codperation. 
The conduct of the recitation period will regulate 
to a great extent the way in which the between- 
recitation period is spent. If the children are led in 
the recitation period to read in the light of a motive. 
if their ability to get thought is checked by judgment 
and organization questions rather than by questions 
calling merely for reproduction or oral reading, if 
they are led to see the importance of reading at one’s 
maximum rate of speed and how this can be accom- 
plished, much of this training will carry over into 
their method of study during the between-recitation 
period. Definite training, however, must be given 
for the use of correct study habits during this period. 
This can be done by observing the following sugges- 
tions: - 
1. The child must feel that the work of this period con- 
tributes to or is necessary for the working out of his 
interests or purposes. ‘This will insure interest and 
attention. There must be enough and varied material 
to meet the needs and interests of individual children. 
2. Sufficient material must be provided so that the bright
-P-A-G-E-127
THE BETWEEN-RECITATION PERIOD 117 
child will work at his maximum rate of speed during 
the entire period. This can be accomplished by allow- 
ing him to do additional work or work of a different 
nature, such as the use of library books, or completing 
aproject. This will avoid the usual waste of time and 
the formation of habits of dawdling. The slower child 
should be required to work at his maximum rate of 
speed, but should not be expected to cover the same 
amount of material that the brighter child does. 
8. Children should often be allowed to select the material 
they wish to use for silent reading during this period in 
order that their individual interests, needs, and abili- 
ties may be met. 
4. Variety in the conduct of this period should be pro- 
vided in order that lack of attention and interest may 
not result. 
5. Individual work must be provided for. This will give 
opportunity for the development of individuality. 
It will also give the child an opportunity to form or 
strengthen certain habits which he feels desirable, as 
well as correcting undesirable habits. 
Individual work and the between-recitation period. 
The following are suggestions for individual work in 
silent reading to be used during the between-recita- 
tion period: 
1. Give written directions, concerning some activity to be 
performed, such as: 
a. Paint or draw with crayola a jonquil. 
b. Show by drawing, how the wind helps us. 
. Show by cutting, how the wind helps us. 
. Model a kitty. 
Read page 3 and draw a picture telling what you 
read. 
2. There should be in every first- or second-grade room 
a table which may be called “The Reading Table.” If 
possible, a set of small chairs should stand around the 
table, and upon it should be a number of such books as 
9 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-128

2 HOW TO TEACH READING 
the children can READ. The books should, of course, be 
illustrated. For the first grade there should be stories 
pasted on tag board, all of the good primers, and a few 
of the easier first readers. 
. Cut stories from old readers or children’s papers. 
Paste them on heavy tag board or place in envelopes. 
Use these as supplementary reading. As a test of 
reading done; encourage some mode of expression 
through drawing, cutting, or modeling. 
. Cut stories from old readers. Paste them upon en- 
velopes. Inside the envelopes have duplicate stories 
sliced in sentences or in words and phrases. Let 
children build up the stories. The child should be able 
to read his story. 
. Illustrate the story or incidents in the story using 
suitable media, as model a figure, illustrating the sen- 
tence taught (in beginning reading), or make a drawing 
at the board or at the seat illustrating the thought 
presented. Use scissors and paper. 
. Paste in a booklet a sentence or sentences. Cut and 
paste in an illustration of the thought, or draw in an 
illustration. Let this vooklet grow from day to day 
and be the child’s own reading book. Use rubber type, 
hectograph, or cut up old readers. 
Give children little reading lessons based upon the 
directed reading. At first let the children paste the © 
lesson in unsliced. Later let them slice these into 
sentences and arrange in the order that the teacher has 
upon the board, or in their own order. Preserve unity 
of thought. These sentences may be pasted in the 
booklet. Use rubber type, hectograph, or cut up old 
readers. 
Provide large envelopes with a mounted picture and a 
related story written on the outside or on tag board 
enclosed in envelope. 
a. Inside have loose duplicate sentences. Let the 
children match like sentences. 
b. Cut the duplicate sentences into phrases. Let 
the children build sentences. 
. Provide envelopes with pictures mounted on outside.

Inside have phrases. Let the child build his own story. 
Within an envelope have a picture cut up and sentences 
about it cut into phrases or words. Let the children 
build up the picture and sentences. 
Provide small pictures of children in various activities. 
Have sentences descriptive of them. Match sentences 
to the pictures. Later on, when children recognize 
words, cut sentences into words. 
Have pictures cut from fashion magazines representing 
different members of a family. (Children can cut and 
mount these.) In an envelope have sentences telling 
who each one is; as, “This is mother,” or, “I am 
mother.” Match sentences and picture. In the book- 
lets, let children paste pictures of characters in the 
Primer. Name them. 
Let children bring, cut, or draw picture illustrating the 
home activities on different days. Have appropriate 
sentences for these; as: 
To-day is Monday. 
We wash our clothes on Monday. 
Let children find sentences telling: 
a. The name of the day. 
b. The kind of day. 
ce. The name of the month, as: 
To-day is Monday. 
It is a clear day. 
This month is February. 
Any familiar rhyme or poem which the children know 
by heart may be cut into single lines and placed in 
envelopes. Children should arrange lines in order, 
from copy or from memory. 
Make booklets and paste or write appropriate sentences 
in these. Illustrate a sheep booklet with the sentence, 
“The sheep give us .’ What the sheep gives 
can be written or drawn. 
Write on the board a sentence or story for the children 
to illustrate. 
Illustration: 
I am Amy’s brown kitten. 
I have a blue ribbon around my neck.

Have children draw, cut, or model the main incidents 
in a story, arranging them in sequence. 
Have children re-read two or three stories to see which 
would be the best to dramatize, read by parts, or tell. 
Have children make figures and scenery necessary for a 
certain selection to be used in a puppet show. 
Have children prepare questions to ask classmates on 
the main points of a story each one had read silently. 
(Attention should be paid to technical points in the 
writing of the questions as well as the English in which 
they are expressed.) 
Have children read in order to answer questions the 
teacher has written on the board which will check the 
silent reading of the selection. 
(Note: The lesson should have been introduced and 
the universal difficulties dealt with before this is re- 
quired. A list of individual difficulties should be kept 
by each child and taken up at a later period, or some 
children could be appointed to help any one having 
such difficulties.) 
Have children practice reading a selection to them- 
selves in order to be the one chosen to take the part of 
one of the characters. 
Have children read a selection and decide the most 
interesting way to take it up with the class. 
Have children decide which part of a story, in a supple- 
mentary or library book, would be most interesting to 
read aloud to the class. 
Have children prepare a synopsis of the story up to or 
following the part read aloud. 
Have children select a review story and prepare to tell 
it for the class to guess the name of the story. 
Have children decide the characters, places, and prop- 
erties needed in the dramatization of a story. 
Have children select the funniest, most beautiful, or 
most exciting part in a selection to present to the class. 
Have children write what two or three paragraphs are 
about and then write out the main thought in each.

Group Work and the Between-Recitation Period 
Tue VALuE or SMALL Groups 
Stimulation. It is often advisable to have children 
work in small groups of four or five children, under the 
leadership of one of their own number. At first the 
leader should be chosen by the teacher because of his 
ability in reading. Later he may be chosen by the 
group itself. 
The use of small groups provides a social situation 
which stimulates many children to put forth greater 
effort than when working by themselves. The old 
adage that two heads are better than one is funda-
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 HOW TO TEACH READING 
mentally true. Because of the smallness of the group, 
the oversensitive and timid child is able to overcome 
his feeling of self-consciousness and timidity. 
Development of social habits. The small groups 
furnish also an opportunity for the development of 
good social habits. When working together with a 
common interest, the need for codperation and the 
sharing of responsibility is felt. Opportunities are 
also given for development of leadership and intel- 
ligent fellowship. Real situations calling for self- 
control arise. 
Development of reading-power. Greater opportunity 
for the development of reading-power is also given 
through the use of small groups because: 
. More children have a chance to participate. 
. Greater opportunity for practice in reading is given. 
. More material can be read. 
. The teacher has greater opportunity to give help to in- 
dividuals and groups especially needing her assistance. 
. Natural situations for discussions arise. 
Be CO ox 
Points to Keep 1n Minp 
To have group work effective, careful attention 
must be paid to the organization and supervision of 
the groups. The following points should be kept in 
mind: 
1, Group work should not be permitted until standards 
in reading have been developed and partially fixed. 
During the recitation period the teacher has the oppor- 
tunity to develop standards of good silent reading. 
She also has the opportunity to make the child con-
-P-A-G-E-133
  
POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND 123 
scious of the habits necessary to attain these standards 
and to make him feel the desirability of forming such 
habits. These habits should become partially fixed in 
the recitation period before group work is attempted; 
otherwise, undesirable habits may creep in when the 
children are working by themselves and less closely 
supervised by the teacher. When a certain number of 
individual children show sufficient reading power, they 
may be allowed to form a small group while the rest of 
the children are doing individual work. This privilege 
of working together will serve as an incentive to the 
rest of the group to form the necessary habits. 
. Standards and habits of order should be well formed 
before children are allowed to work in small groups. 
Each child should show a certain amount of self-con- 
trol before he is permitted to join a social group. The 
teacher as well as the leader of the small group should 
feel responsible for developing and maintaining good 
social habits. At the slightest sign of the lack of self- 
control and codperation, the offending child should be 
isolated from the group and not be permitted to return 
until he shows evidence of being able to contribute his 
part to the success of the group. The gradual forma- 
tion of groups is very desirable, as it gives the teacher 
the opportunity to check more carefully the social 
habits which are absolutely essential to the success of 
group work. 
. Careful attention should be paid to the formation of 
groups. At first the teacher should select the children 
who are strong enough both from the point of view of 
reading habits and social habits to work together. She 
should also select the leader for the group. After the 
children have become accustomed to working together, 
a more scientific basis for the selection of the personnel 
of the groups should be used. Children who need spe- 
cial help or opportunity for drill along definite lines 
should be grouped together under the leadership of a 
child who is strong in that particular. These needs 
can be ascertained by the results of class work or by the 
use of standard tests. ;

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
Opportunity to develop leadership should be given to 
every child. What constitutes good leadership should 
be developed by the teacher. True leadership should 
_be carefully distinguished from bossism. The criti- 
cisms and discussions of the leaders should be carefully 
noted by the teacher in order that the spirit of the 
group be kept sweet and wholesome. Constructive 
criticisms rather than destructive ones should be en- 
couraged. Children should be led to see that it is 
better to say, ‘‘ The work in our group would have been 
better to-day if John had been able to read more 
rapidly,” than, “John read so slowly we couldn’t finish 
our story.” While the leaders at first should be chosen 
from among those who naturally possess the quality of 
leadership, the personnel of the groups should so change 
that at some time or in some subject each child should 
be given the chance to become a leader. The timid 
child needs the opportunity to develop self-confidence. 
The confident child needs the opportunity to develop 
the qualities of good fellowship. It is quite as unde- 
sirable for the bright or overconfident child always to 
be a leader as it is for the backward or timid child 
never to have such an opportunity. Only in this way 
can training in the principles of good democracy be 
developed. The need of democracy to-day is to have 
wise, unselfish leaders and intelligent, responsible 
followers.. The school should be held responsible for 
the development of the habits which are necessary for 
good citizenship. 
. The accomplishments of the groups should be care- 
fully checked by the teacher. Unless the amount and 
type of work accomplished in the groups is carefully 
checked, group work may become a menace rather 
than an asset. The development of social habits 
should also be checked. A few minutes at the close 
of the period may be utilized for this checking. Each 
leader may be asked to give a report of the work of his 
group. Certain members of the group may be asked 
to state how they have been helped or what they have 
accomplished during the period. Sometimes it may be
-P-A-G-E-135
    THE USE OF SMALL GROUPS 125 
advisable for the teacher to state various points she has 
noted about the work or points necessary to keep in 
mind in the future. 
SuaGEsTIONs ror THE Usr or SMALL Groups 
The following are suggestions for group work in 
silent reading to be used during the between-recita- 
tion period: 
1. Children form in small groups of four or five, with a 
leader, appointed first by the teacher, later by the 
children themselves. Let each group decide on some 
story to prepare to present to the whole group. This 
preparation may be to: 
a. 
b. 
Cc Tell the story. 
Dramatize it. 
Pantomime the story. 
. Children form in groups and each read a story or unit 
silently, to be able to tell the story to the others in the 
small group. 
. Children form in groups and read silently a number of 
stories to see which one is best to dramatize. Let dis- 
cussion follow the reading. 
d. . Children form in small groups: 
ar 
b. 
c To plan for a dramatization. 
To practice a dramatization. 
To discuss different conversations that might be 
used in a story. 
To discuss which of two or three familiar stories 
would make the best play. 
. After a number of stories have been developed with the 
teacher, the children may form in small groups: 
a. 
b. To select the story they think would be the best 
to dramatize or reproduce for some special occa- 
sion. 
To plan the best way to dramatize or reproduce 
the selected material.
-P-A-G-E-136
126 HOW TO TEACH READING 
ce. To practice dramatizing or reproducing the se- 
lected material. 
6. The teacher introduces the lesson and writes a question 
or questions on the board for the children to read 
silently and find the answers. The small groups form 
and discuss the answers to the questions. 
. The teacher introduces the lesson. The children read 
the lesson silently, then write questions to bring out the 
main points of the story. The small groups form and 
discuss both the questions and answers. 
. The teacher introduces the lesson and gives a question 
or questions for the children to read silently and find 
the answers. Then the small groups discuss the most 
interesting way to take up the lesson in the recitation 
period. The following ways might be used: 
2. A part of the lesson told and a part read aloud. 
b. Oral reading of the entire selection. 
c. Reproduction of the selection. 
d. Dramatization of the story. 
. After a lesson has been introduced by the teacher, read 
10. 
ll silently by the children, and the thought checked by 
the teacher, the children could form into small groups 
to discuss the sentences, phrases, and words used which 
made them: 
a. See the pictures. 
b. Feel sad, happy, amused or excited. 
c. Know or judge the characters in the story. 
The teacher introduces the lesson and checks the silent 
reading of the children. The groups then organize the 
main movements, thought divisions, or pictures in the 
story. This organization should include the necessary 
subheads under each topic. Both main points and 
subordinate points should be expressed in the form of 
brief, full statements. 
The teacher gives three or four new stories for the 
children to read silently to see which each one thinks 
would be the best to dramatize or reproduce for a spe- 
cial occasion and why. The small groups form and
-P-A-G-E-137
13. 
14, 
  THE USE OF SMALL GROUPS 127 
discuss their individual decision before the class. 
Class discussions participated in by teacher and pupils 
follow. 
. After three or four selections have been read silently 
by the children and the thought checked by the teacher, 
the children make a list of words used in those selec- 
tions which they think would be good ones to add to 
their vocabulary. Groups then form to discuss these 
words. 
Children make a report to the small group on a library 
book read to try to make the cther children want to 
read that material. Following the report the members 
of the group may ask questions to clear up points made 
or have additional ones given. This report may be an 
oral synopsis of the story. 
A library or a supplementary book may be given to 
each of the small groups. Each day, two or three 
children carefully prepare a portion of this book to 
read aloud to the rest of their group. After a few days 
of such work one child is chosen from each group to 
interest the class in the book they have been reading. 
(For suggestions about this report see 1, a, b.) 
. Small groups may form to listen to and offer sugges- 
tions on the written reports given on the library 
material read. The children could choose the question 
from the following suggestive list which seems best 
suited to the material read and answer this on the card 
in the space indicated. 
Why did you like or dislike this book? 
. What did you like best in the book? 
What character did you like best and why? 
. Describe the most interesting, exciting, or funni- 
est part of the book.

  CHAPTER IX 
HOW THE CHILD CAN BECOME A GOOD ORAL 
READER 
Tun VaLvuE or Orat Reaping 
Wuite the importance of training in silent reading is 
being recognized more and more for reasons devel- 
oped in the previous chapter, we must not ignore the 
fact that oral reading also has its value. However, 
the amount and kind of oral reading commonly done 
in the schools cannot be justified. Experiments have 
proved conclusively that too much oral reading 
decreases comprehension as attention is largely 
focused upon the correct calling of words rather than 
the interpretation of thought. Too much oral 
reading “actually builds up fixed habits of word- 
pronunciation and articulation of a slow, plodding 
character which many investigators allege are almost 
ruinous to the formation of the opposite habits of 
rapid, effective, silent reading of the meaningful type.”! 
While the dangers of oral reading must be kept in 
mind, the following values of this typé of reading 
must be recognized: 
1. When reading silently one often comes upon passages 
or ideas that one wishes to share, pith: others, The 
1Q’Brien in Silent Reading. Used by permission of The Mac- 
millan Company, publishers.
-P-A-G-E-141
  HABITS, SKILLS, AND APPRECIATIONS 131 
ability to do this well is dependent upon good oral 
reading. 
2. Certain types of material such as poetry, beautiful 
descriptive and emotional passages can only be fully 
appreciated when they are read aloud. The rhythm 
of poetry, the choice of words in beautiful descriptions, 
and an author’s style can best be enjoyed when they 
are interpreted by the human voice. 
8. Unfamiliar and difficult words are more readily fixed 
in consciousness when they are heard as well as seen. 
Therefore, in beginning reading more attention should 
be paid to oral reading than is necessary in the upper 
grades. 
4, The human voice is one of the most effective instru- 
ments in life. Comparatively few people can use this 
instrument effectively. A good speaking voice, clear 
enunciation and pronunciation are assets in all walks 
of life. Training in good oral reading should result in 
the acquisition of pleasing, well-modulated and easily 
understood voices. The ability to use the voice effec- 
tively cannot be overestimated. Good voice train- 
ing is one of the crying needs of the day. Many 
people with great messages are unable to impart these 
to an audience because they lack the ability to use 
their voices effectively. The school then, should not 
neglect the opportunities which oral reading affords to 
develop desirable speaking voices. 
Hasirs, Skrtus, AND APPRECIATIONS TO BE 
DEVELOPED THROUGH ORAL READING 
In order that a child may become an efficient oral 
reader certain habits, skills, and appreciations need 
to be developed in children. While each grade should 
be held responsible for definite accomplishments, all 
grades should be working toward the realization of 
the following general objectives: 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 HOW TO TEACH READING 
1. To make the audience see the pictures. 
2. To make the audience experience the humor, sadness, 
or excitement of certain passages. 
8. To make the audience feel that the real character is 
talking. 
. To make the audience appreciate and love the poem. 
. To read with pleasing, easily-understood voices. 
To enunciate clearly and pronounce words correctly. 
. To read smoothly. 
. To stand correctly. ODADAS 
Types or MareriAn For Ora REaDIne 
Not all material lends itself to good oral reading. 
Selections which appeal to the emotions, such as 
exciting, pathetic, dramatic, humorous stories, beau- 
tiful descriptions, poetry, and conversations furnish 
excellent material for oral reading. Care should be 
taken that this type of material rather than the 
factual or informational type is selected for training 
in oral reading. Most selections in our readers involve 
material of both types. It remains for the teacher to 
ask such questions that the child will be led to express 
the thoughts of the informational parts in his own 
words and to read aloud the conversations and the 
emotional parts. Through such questions, standards 
of what constitutes good material for silent and oral 
reading will be developed in children. Later they 
themselves should be held responsible for choosing 
the parts suitable for oral reading. The children 
who need the most practice in oral reading should be 
asked the questions calling for oral reading or asked
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 133 
to select the parts best adapted for this type of 
reading. 
Tue TEAcuHER’s CAREFUL PREPARATION FOR 
THE LESSON 
As in silent reading, the teacher must make care- 
ful preparation for the lesson in order that habits, 
skills, and appreciations necessary for good oral 
reading be developed by the children. She must 
know: : 
1. The needs of the group. 
The teacher’s knowledge of the needs of her group 
will be the basis for: 
a. The selection of the materials. 
If the children need much practice in oral 
- reading, the teacher should select material in- 
volving many conversational passages, dramatic 
parts, adventures, beautiful descriptions, as well 
as poetry, rather than informational and factional 
material. In the latter type, however, she should 
make use of all the bits of material that lend 
themselves to oral reading. Besides the oral 
reading material found in basal and supplemen- 
tary books, excellent chapters or passages can be 
selected from library books and home reading. 
Historical material offers many thrilling ex- 
periences, exciting scenes, hazardous undertak- 
ings, heroic tales, fine character delineation, 
incidents of loyalty and bravery, and patriotic 
speeches. Geographical material presents inter- 
esting descriptions of peoples, their ways of 
dressing, living, interesting customs, modes of 
transportation, ideals and aspirations; beautiful 
descriptions of countries, their interesting places, 
beautiful scenery, art treasures, and historical 
landmarks. All these are excellent material for 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
134 
2. 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
oral reading. In addition one sometimes needs 
to read aloud material of a purely factual and 
informational type in order to prove a point or 
sustain an argument. 
b. The grouping of children. 
The children who need much practice in oral 
reading can be grouped together and oral reading 
stressed while the other children do silent reading 
followed by reproduction of the material in their 
own words, rather than by oral reading. In 
rural schools children from two or three grades 
can be thus grouped. The needs of the children 
can be ascertained from the classroom work and 
the results of standard tests. 
The material selected to meet the needs of the group. 
The teacher should be familiar with the material 
selected for the children. She must know the central 
thought, the main divisions of the selection, and the 
portions best adapted for oral reading. The latter she 
must be able to read well herself in order to be able to 
ask thought questions which will help the child to give 
the proper expression. 
. How to use the selected material. 
In order to give the best training in oral reading, 
silent reading should as a rule precede any attempt to 
read aloud. This will enable the child to center his 
attention upon the interpretation of the thought al- 
ready secured. 
The following steps suggested for the preparation of 
silent reading material should precede a period devoted 
primarily to developing the art of oral reading. 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction of the material. (See page 99.) 
2. Motive for reading. (See page 100.) 
8. Mastery of universal difficulties. (See 
page 101.)
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 135 
4. Standards of reading to be kept in mind. 
(See page 103.) 
5. Recall of the motive. (See page 103.) 
6. Material given out or found in the book. 
(See page 103.) 
B. Silent reading. (See page 104.) 
C. Check-up of the silent reading. (See page 104.) 
The check-up of this material which is pri- 
marily of the oral reading type, should call for 
much more oral reading than material of a factual 
or informational type. However, not many 
passages should be read aloud but a question 
given calling for the thought to be expressed 
in the child’s own words. The judgment and 
organization questions, which should play as 
important a part in oral reading as in silent read- 
ing, furnish many opportunities for oral reading. 
Thoughts can be checked and oral reading se- 
cured by the use of such thought questions as the 
following: 
1. Read what a certain character said. 
2. Read it the way you think the character 
said it. 
Read the most exciting part of the story. 
Read the most humorous part. . 
Read the most pathetic part. 
Read the most beautiful part. 
. Read the part containing the most expres- 
sive words. 
. Read the part you like the best. 
. Read the part that proved that Mr. B. was 
kind. 
10. Read the portion that justifies your state- 
ment. 
11. Read the part of the selection that gave the 
most knowledge of a character. 
12. Read the part that makes you see the 
picture most clearly. NOX e Coo

13. Read the stanza of the poem you like best. 
14, Read the answer to a thought question. 
D. Follow-up work. 
Oral reading is an art and as such requires 
much practice for its development. While much 
oral reading is secured in the check-up of the 
silent reading of such material, not all but many 
selections can to advantage be used in additional 
periods. Care must be taken that interest in the 
material and appreciation of the material is not 
destroyed through over-development. 
To develop standards of good oral reading 
suitable material, already checked up from the 
standpoint of thought, should be used in another 
recitation period under the direction of the 
teacher.

Suggestive Steps in an Oral Reading Lesson 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction and motive. 
At the close of the check-up of the silent reading, 
some need for further use of the material should 
have been set up. This will insure interest, atten- 
tion, and good thinking in the use of this familiar 
material. The recall of this need will constitute 
both the introduction and the motive for this lesson. 
The following motives may be suggestive: 
a. To be the one chosen to read to others, as at 
parties, assemblies, to school officers, other 
divisions, groups or grades. 
b. To be able to conduct one Morning Exercise 
period a week. 
. To take part in a Puppet Show. 
. To be able to be the leader of a small group. 
e. To be able to take the part of a certain char- 
acter. are
-P-A-G-E-147
THE PERIOD FOR ORAL READING 137 
f. To increase one’s ability to read well. 
g. To read the most exciting or interesting part 
from library material. 
h. To take part in a dramatization. Dramatiza- 
tions furnish one of the best motives for oral 
reading as: 
(1) Meanings are seen more clearly. 
(2) More repetition with concentrated at- 
tention is possible. 
(3) Initiative is developed. 
(4) It utilizes the dramatic instinct which 
is strong in children. 
(5) It motivates many of the other school 
subjects, as spelling, writing, language, 
handwork, history. 
(6) Good thinking is required in planning 
and criticizing the plays. 
(7) Individuality is developed. 
Note: Along with the dramatizations 
using the books, should go free drama- 
tizations of stories told or read, in 
order to give more training in language. 
2. Review of difficulties. 
In the lower grades the universal difficulties were 
taken up before the children read silently. In the 
upper grades the children were held responsible for 
mastery of these. In all grades the teacher tested 
the mastery of all difficulties, both universal and 
individual. 
If further attention to difficulties in pronuncia- 
tion and enunciation is necessary, it should be given 
at this time in order that fluency and clearness in 
oral reading can be secured. 
8. Development of standards. 
Until standards of good oral reading have been 
established, it is advisable to have the children set 
up definite goals which they wish to attain. For 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
suggestive standards see page 1382. This step 
should be omitted when the attainments of the 
children render it unnecessary and cause a waste of 
time. 
B. Oral reading. 
The type of material and the motive for reading will 
regulate the conduct of the recitation period. The fol- 
lowing procedures may be suggestive: 
1. 
2. Taking the parts of characters. 
Children should decide how many characters are 
in the story. Many children should have the op- 
portunity to take the part of various characters and 
the part of the book before any one is chosen for the 
special occasion for which they are preparing. 
Whenever possible the children should make this 
choice. 
Dramatizing with the books. 
In addition to taking the parts of the characters 
the children can select places in the room which 
will best represent the locations described in the 
story, use simple materials for necessary costumes 
and properties and interpret the part of the charac- 
ters through action. All this will lend variety, 
interest, and enthusiasm to the oral reading and be 
an excellent preparation for free dramatization. 
Reading to answer questions. 
These questions should call for the reading of the 
emotional passages, pictures, and conversations. 
The child should be held responsible for selecting 
the appropriate part in relation to the question and 
for determining the amount to be read. 
Preparing for reproductions. 
Material rich in descriptive passages but not 
dramatic in its character can be read aloud to secure 
good expression and choice use of words, in order 
that the reproduction of the story in the child’s 
own words can be improved.
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE BETWEEN-RECITATION PERIOD 139 
5. Preparing for puppet shows. 
Practice in reading conversations makes possible 
better expression and appropriate language for a 
puppet show. 
6. Reading of a poem. 
Poems, being so much shorter than prose selec- 
tions, can usually be developed in one recitation 
period. They can be checked from the thought 
standpoint and sufficient opportunity can be given 
for the oral reading. The usual steps under prepa- 
ration and the silent reading of the entire poem 
would be followed. In the check-up, the thought 
questions bringing out meanings, appreciations, 
and beautiful expressions, will call for oral reading 
of the portions of the material. Before any attempt 
is made to read the poem as a whole it is well for the 
teacher to read the poem to the class. This calls 
for careful preparation on the part of the teacher in 
order that the beauty and unity of the whole poem 
will be felt by the children. 
Following this, larger portions of the poem 
should be read by the children in relation to thought 
questions. At the close of the period the whole 
poem should again be read either by a child or if 
necessary by the teacher. For lesson plan see 
page 220. If more practice is desired the poem 
could be used in another recitation period or in 
group work in a between-recitation period. 
Group Work IN THE BetTWwEEN-RECITATION 
Prriop 
The values and dangers of group work have been 
discussed on page 121. The following ways of using 
small groups for oral reading may be suggestive: 
1. Have children form in small groups of four or five, with 
a leader, appointed first by the teacher, later by the

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
children themselves. Let each group decide on some 
story to prepare to present to the whole group. This 
preparation may be to: 
a. Read it aloud. 
b. Read it by parts. 
. Have children form in groups and read aloud a number 
of stories in the Primer or the review work that the 
teacher has mounted on heavy cardboard. 
. Have children form in small groups and read aloud a 
number of stories to see which one is best to dramatize. 
Let discussion follow the reading. 
. Have children form in small groups and practice read- 
ing poems already developed in the recitation period. 
. Have children read a selection aloud in order to select 
the one who will take a certain part the best. (This 
material should usually have been dealt with as a 
silent reading lesson where difficulties have been dealt 
with and thought-getting checked.) 
. Have children practice a dramatization. 
. Have children read aloud to the rest of the group a 
chapter or story, which has previously been prepared 
either at home or at school, from one of the supple- 
mentary library books. 
. Have children practice reading a story by parts. 
. After a number of stories have been developed with the 
teacher, the children may form in small groups to 
practice reading to the rest of the small group the 
story or the part of the story they like the best. 
After the lesson has been introduced and the children 
have read silently the groups may form and read the 
story aloud to choose the one from their group who 
reads the best. The ones chosen from the different 
groups compete to see which one will read it on some 
special occasion. 
The small groups form and the children practice read- 
ing aloud or are asked thought questions by each other 
to see whether they are eligible to join a classroom 
Reading Club. 
After a lesson has been introduced by the teacher, read 
silently by the children, and the thought checked by

the teacher the children could form into small groups 
to discuss the sentences, phrases, and words used 
which made them: 
a. See the pictures; or 
b. Feel sad, happy, amused or excited; or 
c. Enabled them to know or to judge the characters 
in the story. 
Children can make a report to the small group on a 
library book read to try to make the other children 
want to read that material. Following the report the 
members of the group may ask questions to clear up 
points made or have additional ones given. This 
report may be an oral reading of parts of the story and 
a synopsis of the rest. 
A library or a supplementary book may be given to 
each of the small groups. Each day two or three 
children carefully prepare a portion of this book to 
read aloud to the rest of their group. After a few days 
of such work one child is chosen from each group to 
interest the class in the book they have been reading. 
For suggestions about this report see 1, a, b. 
Children could select the best newspaper article 
brought in to their group and practice reading it so 
they will be chosen to read it before the class. 
Have children prepare the funniest, most beautiful, or 
most exciting part in a selection to present to the class. 
Have children decide and prepare the parts in a story 
which are best to read aloud. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. Why should training in oral reading be given? 
. What motives can be used for oral reading? 
. What material is best suited for oral reading? 
. What should the child have done before he attempts to read 
aloud? , 
. How can practice in oral reading be secured? 
. What opportunities does group work afford for the develop- 
ment of oral reading? Of social habits? 
. What habits do you need to overcome in your reading? How 
can these be ascertained?

    CHAPTER X 
HOW THE CHILD CAN BE HELPED TO OVERCOME 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFICULTIES 
Tue previous chapters have given positive suggestions 
to help the child become conscious of his need for 
good reading habits. In the suggested steps for both 
silent and oral reading lessons, definite provision has 
been made for the children to feel the need of and 
to work definitely toward the formation of certain 
desirable habits. 
Tuer Neep or Remepiat Measures 
This daily attention to correct habit formation 
will be sufficient to insure efficiency in reading for 
most children, but it will not always be adequate to 
meet the needs of those children who have individual 
difficulties in reading due to physical and mental 
defects, and undesirable habits due to bad training. 
Many children have been unable to continue their 
school work because of the fact that their failure to 
cope with certain school subjects has not been traced 
to their inability to read effectively. It is of funda- 
mental importance that the teacher detect such cases, 
diagnose the difficulties and know how to give reme- 
dial treatment. 
Means or Draenosine Inpivipuat Dirricutties 
To detect children who have trouble in reading and
-P-A-G-E-153
DIAGNOSING INDIVIDUAL DIFFICULTIES 143 
to diagnose their individual difficulties, the following 
_ means can be used: 
1. General observation of the teacher. 
The teacher’s estimate of the child’s ability will be 
based upon her general observation of the child during 
the recitation and study periods and upon the results 
of informal tests. 
The teacher notices that it takes some children much 
longer to finish reading a selection than it does others; 
some are unable to answer questions based upon the 
material; others have difficulty in history and geog- 
raphy in selecting facts pertinent to the problem, and 
in using sources of information effectively; in arith- 
metic, inability to interpret the conditions of the prob- 
lem is shown. These outstanding cases need to be 
studied and to be given special treatment. 
2. The use of informal tests. 
To secure more accurate information the teacher 
can make use of informal tests. Informal tests differ 
from standard tests in that “‘they are not so carefully 
organized, their difficulty has not been scientifically 
determined, and there are no standard scores for each 
grade.” The value of informal tests lies in the fact 
that every teacher can use informal tests when stand- 
ard tests are not available, and can select material 
suited to the particular interests and abilities of her 
group. The following ways of using informal tests are 
suggested: 
a. Informal tests for comprehension. 
Method I 
The teacher selects material suited to the 
interests and ability of the class. This material 
may be in new books or material written or 
printed on cards. After the children have read 
the material silently the teacher passes out 
     
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 HOW TO TEACH READING 
hectographed sheets on which are written a cer- 
tain number of questions. Below these questions 
are written short answers, one of which is correct. 
The following questions based upon the story of 
the Gingerbread Boy would be typical: 
What did the old woman make? 
A cake 
A gingerbread boy 
Some bread 
The teacher reads the first question on this 
sheet and the answers, telling the children to 
check or underscore the correct answer. Follow 
the same plan for each question. The teacher 
determines the value of each question and grades 
the papers on this basis. Individual and class 
graphs can be made from this data. For the 
making of graphs see page 26. 
Method II 
This method can be used when the children 
have greater power than that required for Method 
I. The same procedure is employed as in Method 
I, except that instead of the teacher reading all 
the questions and answers she will simply read 
the first and have the children read for themselves 
the remaining ones. The results can be deter- 
mined and used as suggested in the former 
method. 
Method IIT 
When the children are able to write the answers 
to questions a different check-up is possible. 
After the children have read the selection silently, 
the teacher can give out a list of fact questions 
based upon the material and have the children 
write their answers. Care should be taken that 
the questions are stated clearly and require only 
a short answer. Score and record results as 
before.
-P-A-G-E-155
  DIAGNOSING INDIVIDUAL DIFFICULTIES 145 
Method IV 
In the check-up of silent reading, it is suggested 
that use be made of questions calling for the 
exercise of independent judgment. To test the 
children’s ability to make deductions, a group of 
judgment questions based on the material could 
be given the children to answer after the silent 
reading has taken place. For suggestive ques- 
* tions see page 42. Score as before. 
Method V 
Attention has been called to the advisability 
of using organization questions in the check-up of 
silent reading. The child’s ability to organize 
can be more accurately determined by giving the 
children an informal test. After the silent read- 
ing of a selection has taken place give the children 
a list of organization questions based upon the 
material read. These questions should be stated 
clearly and call for brief answers. For suggestive 
questions see page 45. Score and record results 
as in Method I. 
b. Informal tests of speed in silent reading. 
Ways of giving and scoring informal tests to 
determine the rate of silent reading were taken 
up in detail under Chapter VI, “How the Child 
can increase his Speed in Reading.” For sug- 
gestions see page 64. 
ce. Informal tests in oral reading. 
It is much more difficult to test the ability of 
a child to read aloud than it is his silent reading 
ability. All oral reading tests, whether informal 
or standardized must be given to each child 
separately. This requires so much time that it is 
difficult for teachers of large classes to find the 
time for such tests. It is also much more diffi-
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 
3. 
4. HOW TO TEACH READING 
cult to score the tests as the character of the error 
made must be recorded. 
Oral tests may be given to determine types of 
errors made in word recognition such as, mis- 
pronunciations, insertions, omissions, and substi- 
tutions. Other tests may be given to score the 
quality of oral reading. The habits and skills 
necessary for good oral reading were taken up in 
Chapter IX, “‘How the Child can become a Good 
Oral Reader.” For a list of these habits and skills 
see page 131. 
Standard tests. ’ 
Standard tests in contrast to informal tests are 
scientifically graded as to difficulties, are well organized, 
and give a standard score for each grade. This makes 
possible the comparison of achievements of individuals . 
and their progress from grade to grade. Through the 
use of standard tests, methods of procedure and 
principles of practice can be determined and evaluated. 
Standard tests also indicate more accurately and 
scientifically the child’s reading ability and the indi- 
vidual differences in the reading capacity of the mem- 
bers of the groups. Unless, however, tests are followed 
by remedial measures to remove the cause of the in- 
dividual differences revealed by the diagnosis, the tests 
have little value. 
In giving standard tests care should be taken that 
the directions are carefully followed and the results are 
accurately scored. It cannot be too strongly empha- - 
sized that unless an interpretation of the results be 
made and instruction be given to overcome the diffi- 
culties revealed or to establish effective reading habits, 
standard tests have no value. “It is remedial work 
which gives diagnosis its importance. Indeed, diagno- 
sis has no value except as it leads to remedial plans.” 
(C. T. Gray.) 
Intelligence tests. 
a. The need of objective measurements of mental 
ability.
-P-A-G-E-157
  DIAGNOSING INDIVIDUAL DIFFICULTIES 147 
Standard tests furnish the means for measuring 
objectively the achievements of pupils. In the 
same class, however, there will be children repre- 
senting a wide range of ability. Some of these 
will have achieved the median score for the grade 
with the greatest effort while others may have 
achieved the same result with practically no 
effort. The latter group of children are forming 
bad habits of study because they are not required 
to work to their maximum capacity. Some 
means is needed to ascertain the mental ability 
of each child in order that the slower child may 
not become discouraged and form a distaste for 
school by vainly endeavoring to reach a standard. 
beyond his mental capacity; and that the brighter 
child may not be permitted to put forth little or 
no effort to accomplish standards too low for his 
ability. The personal judgment of the teacher 
cannot be relied upon to ascertain the mental 
ability of the children in her class. A more 
scientific means of measurement must be used. 
This means is furnished by the group and indi- 
vidual intelligence tests. 
While it is an advantage to have these tests 
given by people especially trained and experi- 
enced in psychological testing, they can be given 
by trained teachers especially interested in the 
work and possessing such discretion that they 
will not divulge the results of the tests to either 
parents or children. The possession of such 
knowledge may be the means of ruining the 
bright child by making him overconfident and 
arrogant, while the slower child be equally 
harmed by becoming discouraged, supersensitive, 
and lacking in self-confidence. 
b. The use of intelligence tests. 
The use of intelligence tests is a great aid to 
the teacher in knowing what standards of attain- 
ment should be required of each child, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
148 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
kind and amount of material to be used. In- 
telligence tests can also be used in classifying 
children according to ability. In large schools 
the children of the same grade can be grouped 
into different rooms according to mental ability. 
In smaller schools where all the children of one 
grade must necessarily be in one room, the teacher 
can classify the children into two or three groups 
according to mental ability. The use of small 
groups in the between-recitation period makes 
a finer division according to ability possible. 
Different material and varying amounts can be 
required of the different groups. 
The teacher should expect that a child whose 
mental age is equal to or above the mental age 
of his grade would be able to meet the norm in 
reading ability for that grade. When this is not 
the case remedial measures are shown to be 
necessary. 
INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS OF TESTS 
The use of standard and intelligence tests must be 
followed by a careful analysis of the results obtained. 
This is necessary in order that the proper remedial 
measures may be applied. The teacher must know 
to what causes the defects are due. 
1. Defects in comprehension in silent reading, may be due 
to: 
a. a mo 
Ro Lack of interest and consequent lack of attention 
and effort. 
. Inadequate experiences for the interpretation of 
the material. 
. Lack of control over the mechanics of reading. 
. A short span of perception.

Defective vision.

. Lack of comprehension. 
. Faulty eye-movements. 
. Short span of perception. 
. Speech defects. 
Lack of control over words. 
. Apperceptive processes too active. 
. Too great attention to trifles. ‘ 
  Pm ro no oe 
The teacher must determine which of these factors 
are causing the deficiency in reading. This can be : 
done only by a continuous and intelligent study of the 
child and by the use of many different tests. After 
the factors causing the trouble are determined, 
remedial measures must be given. 
Remepiat Mrasures 
The following remedial measures are suggested to 
aid the child in overcoming the most universal diffi- 
culties: 
1. For lack of interest in reading: 
a. Find out the child’s interests and select or formu- 
late easy reading material related to these in- 
terests.

  HOW TO TEACH READING 
. Make the child feel his need of reading in order 
to carry on his own interests, as the radio, base- 
ball, stories. 
. Surround the child with attractive material re- 
lated to his interests. Make him curious about 
this material but do not permit any one to read 
the material to him. 
. Make the child confident of his ability to read 
the material by referring to his success in other 
lines and appealing to his pride. 
. Commend the slightest sign of improvement. 
Give the child questions to report upon in class 
which are related to his interests. These ques- 
tions should require reading. 
. Give the child material to read aloud which is 
related to his interests, and with which the other 
children are unfamiliar. 
. Get the child interested in taking part in a 
dramatization by allowing him to choose the 
character he would like to represent. 
Arouse interest in reading material by the use of 
an introduction. 
For further suggestions see Chapter III. 
2. For lack of adequate experiences to interpret material: 
a. 
b. Select or formulate material related to the child’s 
experiences. 
Build up experiences that will enable him to 
interpret the material. This can be done by: 
(1) The use of excursions. 
(2) Real objects brought into the classroom. 
(3) The use of pictures. 
(4) Reports and stories given by classmates. 
(5) Working out a project or activity. 
Relate the new material to his experiences by the 
use of an introduction. 
For further suggestions see Chapter III. 
8. For lack of control over words: 
a. Select or formulate stories related to the child’s
-P-A-G-E-161
  REMEDIAL MEASURES 151 
interests, using the same vocabulary in many 
different situations. 
. Make the child eager to read the material by a 
short introduction and a motive question. 
. Before the child attempts to read help him to 
master the words which you know will cause the 
greatest difficulty by presenting the words in 
phrases or short sentences and then: 
(1) Having him skip over words and get the 
meaning through context. 
(2) Having him find familiar phonetic elements 
in the words. 
(8) Referring him to other situations in which 
the word has been used. . 
. Give much drill upon words in context. See 
page 48. 
. Have the child find all the words on the page 
belonging to the ight family; all the words be- 
ginning with a certain sound or letter, as J. 
. Give lists of words and have the child find familiar 
elements. All these words must be in the oral 
vocabulary of the child so that their meaning 
will be known. 
Interest the child in playing phonic games. 
See page 88. 
. Introduce new words into the child’s oral vocabu- 
a. lary through the use of pictures, objects, excur- 
sions, and descriptions. Have the written symbol 
follow the oral presentation. 
. Introduce the written symbol to the child through 
.the use of pictures, objects, and descriptions. 
. Make perception cards with pictures or illustra- 
tions explaining the meaning of phrases or short 
sentences printed below the pictures. Make 
quick exposure of these cards. 
For further suggestions see Chapter V. 
4. For lack of comprehension: 
Give the child a small amount of reading material 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
152 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
suited to his interests and ability. Have him 
read this silently in the light of a motive question. 
After he finishes reading have him answer the 
motive question. As the child’s ability develops 
give questions that require the reading of larger 
amounts of material. Check for the main points 
and necessary details. 
. Have the child read a paragraph silently and then 
tell what the paragraph is about. 
. Have the child read the material and reproduce 
the substance of the amount read. 
. Have the child make an organization of the 
material read. 
. Let the child read the material silently and name 
the pictures seen. 
Have the child read silently and plan for a 
dramatization. 
. Have the child arrange marginal headings for the 
material read. 
. Have the child find sentences, words, or phrases 
  
that tell i 
After the child has read silently have him give 
adjectives that describe a certain character. 
Have him read or tell certain portions of the 
story to prove the correctness of the adjectives 
chosen. 
Have the child decide how far he would have to 
read to tell a certain portion of the story. 
. Have the child read the most amusing, pathetic, 
exciting part of the story, or the part he likes the 
best. 
For further suggestions see Chapter IV. 
5. For short span of perception and faulty eye-movements: 
a. 
b. 
c. Discuss the problem with the child and enlist his 
codperation. 
After the silent reading of material have the child 
find phrases that tell

d. Print upon a card a simple story found in a book. 
Cut this into phrases. Expose the phrase cards 
in sequence until the whole story has been pre- 
sented. ‘Test the child’s comprehension of the 
material read. Have the child find the same story 
in the book and read it, striving to take in with 
the eye the same amount of material as seen on 
the phrase cards. Continue such training, de- 
creasing the time of exposure or increasing the 
amount of material on the cards. 
e. Have the child read simple material. Tell him 
to run his eye rapidly across the line taking in as 
much as possible at each movement of the eye. 
Test the child’s ability to get the thought of 
what was read. 
f. Mark off familiar reading material into phrases. 
Have the child practice swinging his eye from 
mark to mark. 
g. Prepare reading material with wide spaces be- 
tween the lines. Use this with the child who has 
difficulty in making his return sweep of the eye 
pick up the correct line. Gradually decrease the 
space between the lines. 
h. The following methods should be used with 
children who have difficulty in attacking and 
identifying new or difficult words: 
(1) Have the child find all the words on a page 
that belong to the ake family. Have him 
find all the words beginning with a certain 
sound or letter. 
(2) Give lists of words and have the child find 
‘ familiar elements. All these words should 
be in the oral vocabulary of the child so 
that their meaning would be known. 
6. For vocalization in silent reading: 
a. Discuss the problem with the child and enlist his 
codperation. 
b. Have the child place a finger on his lips to become 
conscious of his lip movements.

e. In the child’s oral reading ignore omissions, addi- 
tions, and substitutions of little words. 
f. Always have the child’s oral reading preceded by 
as much silent reading of the material as is neces- 
sary for him to become perfectly familiar with the 
thoughts of the selection. 
g. Make great use of judgment and organization 
questions in checking the child’s silent reading, 
ignoring for a while the details. 
9. For speech defects: 
a. If the speech defects are due to defective enuncia- 
tion, make use of phonics. See “Phonic Games,” 
page 88. 
b. To correct stammering: 
(1) Have the child know what he is going to 
say before attempting to give utterance 
to the words. 
(2) Have the child produce sound at once, 
carrying the sound from word to word. 
(8) Work with the child individually in order 
to remove all causes of embarrassment.

  PART IV 
WORK BY GRADES 
CHAPTER XI 
THE KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
In order to be able to interpret reading symbols, it is 
necessary to have a rich fund of human experiences 
and nature experience. The city child is often lacking 
in the experiences with nature to enable him to 
interpret stories about birds, flowers, and animals. 
The child brought up in the country needs an enlarged 
social experience. The kindergarten offers the oppor- 
tunity to build up this background of experience 
before reading symbols are presented. This is 
accomplished through the use of excursions to parks, 
farms, vacant lots, and to see various community 
helpers at work, as the fireman, store-keepers, the 
farmer. An increased appreciation and understand- 
ing of the interdependence of life is brought about 
through the playing out of experiences and the care 
and responsibility of caring for flowers, plants, bulbs, 
gardens, goldfish, birds, and other pets. 
In addition to a fund of experiences for the inter- 
pretation of reading material, the child must have 
also a fund of everyday words. These are gained 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE KINDERGARTEN 157 
through the talking over of excursions, the carrying 
on of activities and the enjoyment of and participa- 
tion in stories, songs, and poems. In the kindergarten 
there is greater opportunity given for the child to 
express himself, and have his questions answered than 
has yet been given in the grades. The great use of 
objects in the kindergarten gives the foreign child 
the opportunity to learn English in the ideal way. 
No attempt should be made to teach reading in the 
kindergarten, as intelligence tests have proved that 
until the child is six years old mentally he is not 
ready to deal with the complex process of reading. 
Many children, however, of kindergarten age chrono- 
logically are mentally six years old and, therefore, 
ready for reading. Likewise many children six years 
old are not yet ready for reading because they are 
slower in developing, and are not six years old men- 
tally. It is most necessary that we ascertain through 
the use of intelligence tests when a child is ready to 
begin reading. If a child is forced to begin reading 
too soon, he becomes discouraged and a permanent 
dislike for reading often results. On the other hand, 
if reading is deferred too long, interest in reading 
wanes and bad habits of application result. 
Therefore, the kindergarten can do much to create 
and foster an interest in reading by: 
1. Enlarging the children’s experiences so that they will 
be interested in and able to understand the content of 
children’s books.  
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 HOW TO TEACH READING 
2. Telling stories, Mother Goose rhymes, and poems to 
children. 
8. Having children retell a few of the simpler stories. 
4. Having the children dramatize some of the Mother 
Goose rhymes. 
5. Surrounding the children with pictures and books with 
or without simple sentences attached. 
6. Having the children memorize a few short poems and 
nursery rhymes. 
Whenever the need arises for the use of symbols, 
as in the labeling of buildings in the community, it 
should be met. Care should be taken, however, to 
use more than one word in the label in order that 
from the very first the eye be trained to take in groups 
of related words. For this reason, the use of labels 
on articles of furniture in the kindergarten room is 
not advocated. 
THE FIRST GRADE 
Certain general objectives in reading should be kept 
in mind by all teachers. In addition each grade 
should strive to have the children attain certain 
definite appreciations, habits, and skills. These 
standards of attainment should constitute a guide 
for the teacher in her work and become the goal of 
achievement for the grade.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF READING 
MATERIALS 
Tue Use or Directions 
The advantages of using directions. The teaching 
of beginning reading is one of the most vital as well , 
as the most difficult problems that confronts the 
teacher of any grade. The child’s conception of what 
reading really is and his interest in it depends upon 
the selection and the method of presenting material. 
Subject matter and method, then, are most far 
reaching in their importance. The correct habits 
and skills must be formed from the very first.\ There- 
fore, the teacher of beginning reading must know the 
psychology of reading and of habit formation. If 
effective reading in life demands that the eye take in 
   
-P-A-G-E-173
THE USE OF DIRECTIONS 163 
begun from the very first, { This can be accomplished 
by the teacher presenting ‘the words in short sen- 
tences and not in isolation) If silent reading is the 
important type of reading in life, training in silent 
reading should be begun in the first grade. We 
should not expect the child in the fourth grade to be 
able to read well silently after the habit of reading 
everything aloud has become firmly fixed. 
yy means of directions written or printed on the 
board or on tag, the child realizes that the symbols 
are real carriers of meaning. He also feels a need for 
knowing what these meanings are. Instead of giving as much as possible at one (iis. this habit must be 
oral directions, the teacher should make use of the 
numberless natural situations for the use of the read- 
ing symbols by giving various directions in written 
or printed form. 
Such directions furnish excellent silent reading 
material. The vocabulary used should reinforce or 
anticipate whenever possible the vocabulary of the 
basal text. The vocabulary used in directions be- 
comes easily fixed because so many natural situa- 
tions for its repetition arise during the day. The use 
of directions in beginning reading is, therefore, advo- 
cated because: 
1. The child forms the conception that reading is thought- 
getting. 
2. The child has a need for knowing what the symbols 
say, so becomes interested in them. 
8. Directions furnish opportunity for the formation of 
correct habits and skills. 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
164 HOW TO TEACH READING 
4. They are used in natural situations. 
5. They are excellent silent reading material. 
6. Their repeated use in natural situations furnish oppor- 
tunities for the right type of drill. 
The form of the material. In order that correct 
habits may be established, great care must be taken 
in the form in which the material is presented. 
The educational world is divided in regard to the 
use of script or print in beginning reading. The 
advocates of print contend that as most of the child’s 
reading will be done with printed symbols, the printed 
symbol should be used from the first. On the other 
hand, the advocates of script say that the printing 
of most teachers does not present a correct printed 
form. Printing is also a much slower process than 
writing. Most teachers write better than they print. 
Normal schools have felt that an unjustifiable amount 
of time would be necessary to secure the required 
speed and necessary excellence in printing. 
As all teachers should be required to have the 
ability to write well and rapidly, it would seem more 
economical to have all blackboard work done in script. 
However, from the very first, running parallel with 
this blackboard script should be the same material in - 
printed form on tag board. Chart printing outfits 
which give the letter forms as the child will meet 
them in his book, can be used by the teacher to intro- 
duce the child to print. The type used for this work 
should have two-inch capitals, and one-inch small 
letters. All teachers of beginning reading should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
THE USE OF DIRECTIONS 165 
  supplied with one of these chart printing outfits and 
large sheets of heavy tag board. 
Care should be taken that, in the use of directions, 
the writing is legible, large, and bold with no unnatural 
divisions between the separate words. The letter 
forms used should be simple and uniform throughout 
the grades. { The lines should be of uniform length 
and short at first. Later in the year when longer 
sentences are used, care should be taken that the 
phrases are not divided. ) Every sentence should 
carry its correct capitals and punctuation marks.

Ways of presenting this material: 
: Method I 
In beginning the work in reading, after the direction has 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  a 166 HOW TO TEACH READING 
been repeated orally, the teacher writes it on the board, 
calling attention to the fact that the written symbols tells 
the children to do the same thing. 
Method II 
Following Method I, the teacher says, “Instead of telling 
you what to do, I am going to write it with the chalk. See 
t you can do what it tells you.” The teacher writes on the 
~board the same direction that was used in Method I. 
oN Method III 
(Using new and old words) 
After a between-recitation period spent in making black 
cats for Halloween™decorations, the teacher writes on the 
board, “Bring me the ket.” The children have had the 
first two words before butsare not familiar with the last 
word. The teacher covers eee words and says, 
“You know these two words. Whatdo we need in order to 
gather up our scraps? Now who can do what the sentence 
says?” The teacher calls on a child or writes a child’s 
me on the board after the sentence. 
~ UN. 
Tux Use or Action Sentences 
The advantages of action sentences. The use of 
action sentences is excellent for beginning reading. 
Action sentences furnish the material which can be 
well motivated through the child’s love for activity. 
As the meaning of the sentences can be checked 
through action, it is excellent material for silent 
reading. The advantages given under the use of 
directions are also true in the use of action sentences, 
Selection of material. Whenever possible it is 
well to use the verbs and nouns that will be needed 
in the basal primer. The teacher, however, should
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE USE OF DIRECTIONS 167 
not be limited by these words as action sentences 
give an opportunity for the rapid acquisition of 
vocabulary. 
Form of material. The same care in regard to 
form should be observed in using action sentences as 
in using directions. The points to be kept in mind 
are given under “ Form of Material,” on page 174.

Bring to the class a toy, such as a ball. Have the children 
show what they can do with it. Have John tell another 
child to do what he did with the ball, as ‘Roll the ball.” 
Say to the children, “I am going to tell somebody to do the 
same thing that John did only in a different way.” Write 
on the board, “Roll the ball.”” Proceed in a similar manner 
to develop “Throw the ball’ and “Bounce the ball.”

the children, write the direction on the board. Have all the 
children notice this very carefully and one child carry out 
the action. Another child-can be called upon to tell what 
the sentence told the child to do. Erase this sentence and 
write it again, having all the class read silently and a child 
do what the sentence says. This may be done many times. 
Follow this same procedure with at least one other action 
sentence during this period. 
Method III 
(Procedure with old and new material) 
Write on the board one of the sentences which has been 
developed previously. Have the action performed by some, 
read by others. Present new sentences in the way that has 
been suggested. 
Method IV 
(Procedure with old and new material) 
Have a number of review sentences written on the board. 
Have each child select the sentences which he wants to do. 
Call on one child to do his sentence and another child to 
pick out the sentence which was acted out. Develop a new 
sentence or sentences in the way previously suggested. Add 
new nouns as well as verbs. 
MethodV ~ 
(Procedure with old material) 
Have a number of review sentences already written on the 
board and numbered. Have a child select a sentence which 
he would like to act out and whisper this and the number of 
it to the teacher. This child says, “My sentence is 
No.—. What does it tell you to do?” He then calls 
on anumber of children to whisper to him what the sen- 
tence says. "
-P-A-G-E-179
    THE USE OF DIRECTIONS — 169 
Method VI 
(Procedure with new action sentences but review vocabulary) 
Suppose the children know the action sentences, “Find 
the apple.” “Find the basket.” “Bring me the apple.” 
“Bring me the basket.” They have also had “boy” and 
“girl” in a reading unit. The teacher writes on the board 
the new action sentence, “Find the boy.” The children 
read this silently and then come up and whisper to her what 
the sentence says. Finally the sentence is acted and read 
aloud. Other sentences could be developed in a similar way. 
Tue Use or Grenrines 
The advantages of using greetings. The use of 
greetings furnishes another means of closely relating 
reading symbols to the experiences and interests of 
children. At first greetings should be very short and 
simple, increasing in length and difficulty as the 
children’s power develops. They are also an excellent 
means of anticipating and reinforcing the vocabulary 
already presented in directions, action sentences, and 
reading units. 
The form of material. The form of the material 
has a great influence on the establishment of correct 
> habits of reading. The following points should be 
observed: 
1. Correct sequence in the use of sentences must be 
observed. 
2. There should be a good beginning and a good ending 
sentence. 
8. The sentences should not involve too many difficulties. 
4. The sentences should provide frequent repetition of 
phrases and words used in the basal text. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 HOW TO TEACH READING 
5. The sentences should be short and of fairly uniform 
length. 
6. The phrases should not be divided. 
7. The writing on the blackboard should be large, legi- 
ble, and bold. 
8. The type used on the charts should be large and bold.

Good morning, girls. 
Good morning, children.

This is Tuesday morning. 
We are going to make baskets to-day. 
How do you do, children. 
It is a warm, sunny day. 
We can play out of doors. 
We can play ball. 
Ways of presenting this material: 
Method I 
(Procedure with new material) 
The teacher says, “Instead of saying good morning to the 
girls, Iam going to write it on the board.” She does so and 
develops “Good morning, boys,” in the same way. She 
then has the boys answer when she points to the sentence 
which says good morning to them and the girls respond to 
her greeting to them. 
Method IT 
(Procedure with old and new material) 
The teacher writes on the board, “Good morning, boys 
and girls,” and asks some child to tell what she has written. 
Then she asks for some child to tell her what day of the week
-P-A-G-E-181
    THE USE OF DIRECTIONS 171 
it is and writes the answer on the board. The teacher asks, 
“What did we decide yesterday that we needed to make 
to-day for our party? Tell me that.” The teacher writes, 
“We are going to make baskets to-day.” She then reviews 
the sentences by having the children find the sentence that 
tells how she greeted them, what they are going to make, 
and what day it is. 
Method III 
(Procedure with old and new material) 
The teacher has already written on the board such a 
greeting as the following which has the new phrases “Good 
afternoon” and “plant seeds.” 
Good afternoon, children. 
This is Friday afternoon. 
It is a rainy afternoon. 
We are going to plant seeds. 
The teacher says, ““What do we sometimes say when we 
meet people instead of good morning?” ‘That is just what 
this part of the first sentence says.” She then calls on a 
number of children to read the sentence aloud after the 
whole class has been told to read the entire sentence to 
themselves. The teacher then has them look at the next 
sentence and if best says that it tells them what day it is. 
She has a number of children whisper this to her and finally 
has it read aloud. She develops the next sentence in the 
same way. She tells them that the last sentence tells what 
they decided to do and if necessary gives them the new 
words “plant seeds.” 
Tur Us or 4 Goop News Corner . 
The bulletin board or a corner of the blackboard 
can be reserved for good news items. The good news 
items may consist of comments on the children’s 
work, plans for the day, a new picture with a simple
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 HOW TO TEACH READING 
story attached, interesting items in regard to nature, 
some of the best work of the children, personal items 
about the children, plans for the observance of 
festivals, a short riddle to be guessed, original poems 
made by the children and printed by the~teacher, 
weather observations, reading units worked out on 
the blackboard the day before and now printed by the 
teacher on tag board. 
Advantages of the Good News Corner. The good 
news items are especially interesting to children 
because of the personal element. They make the 
child curious and eager to read and to find out what 
new item has been placed in the Good News Corner. 
They furnish another means of closely relating reading 
symbols to the interests and experiences of children 
and are an excellent means of anticipating and rein- 
forcing the vocabulary already presented.

Ways of presenting this material. These items 
should be in the Good News Corner when the children 
arrive in the morning. The children should be made 
curious concerning the items but they should not be 
developed in a reading lesson. ‘The children should 
be allowed to go to this corner individually or in 
groups before school, at recess, or during the between- 
recitation period. Individuals or groups wishing to 
tell what they have read should be allowed to do so.

Ways of presenting this material: 
The Brownie Unit 
The teacher at Halloween time shows a picture of a 
brownie and says, “This little fellow is going to talk to you 
this morning. Would you like to know what he likes best 
todo? First, he will tell us who he is.” The teacher writes 
on the board, “I am a little brownie.” The children read 
it silently. If children seem to be having difficulty with the 
last word the teacher says, “Is there any word you do not 
know? Who is this? Then what would he say he is?” 
Individual children whisper the sentence to the teacher. 
Finally one child reads it aloud. 
The teacher says, “The brownie tells us what he has.” 
She writes on the board the second sentence. The children 
read silently and if necessary the teacher points to the red 
cap. She goes about letting the children whisper the sen- 
tence to her. Finally one child is asked to give it aloud. 
The third sentence is developed in like manner. To pre- 
sent the next sentence the teacher says, “This is something 
the brownie does.” The teacher writes, “I hide in nuts.” 
She frames with her hands the first two words and says, 
“This part says, ‘I hide.’” She then proceeds as with the 
former sentences. 
In developing the fifth sentence the teacher holds the 
children responsible for knowing the phrase “I hide.” The 
teacher points to the word too and says, ‘‘This is my word.” 
She tells what the word is. The following judgment ques- 
tions may be asked, as, “‘Why does a brownie hide in nuts 
and flowers? Which place would you rather hide in?” 
Instead of having the children whisper what the sixth 
sentence says, she has the children show what the brownie 
likes to do. 
The teacher writes the last sentence on the board and 
says, “This is what the brownie likes best to do.” If some 
of the children are having difficulty with the word surprise, 
the teacher recalls what they are planning to do to Miss B’s 
room. ws 
The teacher now asks the children to:
-P-A-G-E-187
  
THE USE OF READING UNITS 77 _ . Find the sentence that tells who is talking. 
2. Show on the picture what this sentence says the 
brownie has. 
. Find another sentence that tells what the brownie has. 
. Find a sentence that tells where the brownie hides. 
. Read the two sentences that tell what the brownie 
likes to do. 
6. Find all the sentences that tell what the brownie has. 
Have another child show on the picture what the 
different sentences said. 
7. Do something a brownie likes to do. Have another 
child find the sentence that says what the child did. 
8. Frame with their hands phrases in answer to questions, 
as: 
Where does the brownie hide? 
What does he say he is? 
What does he say he has? 
Whom does he like to surprise? 
What does he say he does in nuts and flowers? How 
many times can you find it? How many words can 
you find that begin with the sound 4? (The teacher 
gives the sound.) om OO 
Suggestive steps in reading units. In the above 
illustration it will be noted that there was: 
1. A brief introduction by the use of a picture. 
2. A motive question for the reading of the whole unit and 
for each individual sentence. 
8. Difficulties were mastered as they were encountered by: 
a. Using suggestive questions. 
b. Referring to the picture. 
ce. Recalling previous use of a word. (surprise) 
d. Telling the word. 
4. The sentences were read silently in the light of a ques- 
tion. 
5. The thought was checked by having the children: » 
a. Whisper the sentence to the teacher. 
b. Read the sentence aloud.

SuacEsTIons For THE Usz or BasaL AND 
SUPPLEMENTARY MarteERIAL 
To utilize to the fullest extent the psychological 
principles governing reading, the following sugges- 
tions for the use of basal texts are given: 
i To relate beginning reading more closely to the needs 
and interests of children, action sentences, greetings, 
and reading units sheuld be used before the basal chart 
work is begun. This material should be expressed, 
whenever possible, in the vocabulary of the basal book 
used but in a different story. The vocabulary of the 
basal books should be used in many different situations, 
so that many cues to the recall of a word will be formed. 
. As soon as possible, the children should not be told the 
story they are to read. We, as adults, are more eager 
to read unfamiliar material. 
. Dramatization should follow the reading of the story 
rather than precede it. 
. Attention to individual words should not be required 
too soon. The order of development should be from 
whole sentences, to phrases, to words, to parts of words. 
. Drill on words should be had, but it should be had 
largely when words are in context. Isolated words 
are rarely met with in life. 
. Silent reading should always precede any attempt at 
oral reading. 
. Children should have some motive for reading each 
lesson.
-P-A-G-E-191
BASAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 181 
8. The value of a period spent in just isolated word drill 
is to be questioned. 
9. Call for sentences, or words from the thought side. 
Example: Find the word that tells what Little Bo- 
Peep lost. 
Mernop or Presentine Earty Boox Lessons 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. (See page 99.) 
2. The motive. 
In addition to the motive question given for the 
entire selection there should be a motive question 
for the unit of the story to be read during one 
period. Sometimes the latter only would be es 
(See page 100.) 
8. Mastery of difficulties. 
In the beginning of I B grade the universal diffi- 
culties should be dealt with when they occur, pro- 
vided they have not been anticipated and devel- 
oped through blackboard or chart lessons. In the 
latter part of I B and in the I A grade the universal 
difficulties should be dealt with in phrases before 
the material is read. (See page 101.) 
4. Setting up standards. 
In the early lessons the children are not made 
conscious of standards but the teacher is very con- 
scious of these and guards against the formation 
of bad habits. The habit of pointing to individual 
words should be prevented from the first. Ob- 
servance of the following suggestions will be helpful: 
a. The teacher’s own example in not pointing to 
individual words. 
b. Having all the children read the entire sen- 
tence silently before any child is called upon 
to read the sentence aloud or to carry it out in 
action. 
c. Having the child place the pointer, or a small 
card called the finder, under the sentence 
being read.
-P-A-G-E-192
  
182 HOW TO TEACH READING 
d. Having the child frame with his hands or 
fingers the sentence or part of the sentence 
called for. 
e. Sweeping the arm under the whole sentence 
called for. 
5. Recall of motive. Not necessary. (See page 103.) 
6. Passing out books. 
The material should not be in the hands of the 
children up to this time as it is apt to be distracting. 
B. Silent reading. 
At first a question calling for merely the reading of one 
sentence should be given. These questions should in- 
crease in scope as the child’s power develops until he is 
able to read a number of sentences silently in relation to 
one question and finally a whole unit of the story. 
During the silent reading of the sentence or sentences 
the teacher is busy helping the children with their diffi- 
culties and correcting all audible reading and pointing to 
words. 
C. The check-up. 
Many of the answers to the questions will call for the 
oral reading of the sentence immediately following the 
silent reading of it. Some of the answers, however, 
should be given in the child’s own words. This would be 
determined by the nature of the material. When all of 
the unit for the period has been covered in this way, the 
motive question will have been answered. However, 
especial attention should be called to the finding of the 
answer to this question as it calls for the central thought 
of this unit. Sometimes the judgment questions will 
follow the question calling for the reading of that particu- 
Jar part. Sometimes they will be given after the entire 
lesson has been read. See page 42. 
Organization questions will follow the reading of the 
unit and call for a re-reading of related thoughts. See 
page 45.

This first lesson given in the book was developed 
after a short period when the children were given the 
book for the first time and allowed to look at the 
pictures and enjoy the book. They were allowed to 
talk about any pictures which especially interested 
them. They were shown that in turning pages it is 
best to turn them from the upper right-hand corner. 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
What do cats like to eat? 
Do they always have their food given them? 
2. Motive. 
Would you like to read a story about a cat and 
find out what she tried to get for her dinner? 
8. Passing out of books. 
Have the children open the book to page 7. 
Give each child a strip of heavy durable paper 
about 1 inch wide and 4 inches long to be used as a 
marker.

The teacher asks, “What do you see in the pic- 
ture? Place your marker under the title of the 
story. What part of this do you know? Then 
whose dinner is it? Put your marker under the 
next line. Read and find out what Alice said. 
Did she say anything else? Slip your marker down 
under the next line and find out. Who can call the 
cat just the way Alice did?” (Have a number 
read.) “Did the cat go? Read the next line and 
find out. Why not? Who will read all the cat

own dinner? What do you suppose she will try to 
get? Turn over to the next page and let us find 
out.” 
“Place your marker under the first line and read 
it to yourself. Show me what the cat saw. Did 
any one else see it? Who? What did the bird see? 
Did it see anything else? Read and tell me what 
happened then. Why did the bird fly away? 
What did you find out that the cat tried to get for 
dinner?” 
“Turn back to the first page. Who would like 
to be Alice and read what she said? Who would 
like to be the cat and read what she said?” (Have 
a number of children chosen for the different parts.) 
“Show me with your fingers the word that tells 
what the cat was going to find. How many times 
can you find it on this page? On the next page 
show me the words that tell what the cat saw. 
Find the words that tell what she saw. Show the

His father gave him 
a pair of beautiful red moccasins 
and a belt of beads. 
Forest Rover 
put on his fine clothes 
and went for a walk in the forest. 
By and by he saw a Bear. 
He was very much frightened 
and started to run away. 
The Bear saw Forest Rover 
and ran after him. 
“*Forest Rover,” he growled, 
“T am going to eat you.” 
“Oh, please do not eat me!” 
“What will you give me, 
if I do not eat you?” 
“JT will give you 
my beautiful deerskin coat.” 
“Tf you will give me your coat, 
I will not eat you to-day.” 
So the Bear put on the coat. 
“T am the finest Bear in the forest.”

ful moccasins. (If the children cannot get the 
phrase through the context, the teacher gives the 
phrase.) 
This is what boys wear —a pair of trousers.

  THE USE OF LIBRARY MATERIAL 189 
D. Follow-up work. 
After the whole story has been read in a manner similar 
to this unit, the story can be read by parts or dramatized. 
During the between-recitation periods, the whole story 
or parts of the story can be illustrated. 
Tue Use or Lisrary Marerian 
The object of the library table is to furnish children 
additional opportunity to enjoy books through han- 
dling and selecting material that appeals to them. 
This table should be furnished with easy, carefully 
selected books not to be used in the recitation periods. 
There should be a wide range of books, not more than 
one or two copies of each. Besides the books, there 
could be pictures with simple stories attached, stories 
cut from old readers and mounted on heavy cardboard, 
reading units that have been developed in class, pic- 
ture books, and little reading booklets made by chil- 
dren of the higher grades. 
The children should be allowed to use this material 
before and after school, and at odd times during the 
day. Sometimes a small group of children can “be 
sent to the library table to find selections suitable for 
a special occasion. Whenever individuals or groups 
wish to read material to the class which they have 
selected and carefully prepared, they should be 
allowed to do so. No other check-up of the reading 
of the library material is advocated. The main 
object of the library table is accomplished if the 
children begin to love to browse in books.

PuHonics 
“Much ear training should be given in word rhyming 
in the First Grade. Words should not be broken up 
into their phonetic elements too soon. Those con- 
sonant sounds and phonograms which are met with 
most frequently should be developed. For the treat- 
ment of phonics, see page 77. 
Activities Necessitatinc Mucu Reapine 
A Reapine Party 
(IB ann I A) 
Situation. In previous years when the children in 
the first grade had been allowed to take their primers 
and first readers home it was found that the parents 
were apt to read the stories to them. In this way the 
children became familiar with the material and were 
not as eager to read the story at school. It was also 
difficult to tell whether they responded to the written 
symbols or their knowledge of the material. The 
teacher, therefore, decided not to let the children 
take their readers home, but early in November sug- 
gested that they invite their parents to come to a 
“Reading Party.” In this way it was thought that 
the parents would not only find out what their child 
was doing in comparison with other children, but 
would also get an idea of the right way to help the 
child at home. The children were delighted with the 
idea and at once began to plan how to get ready for
-P-A-G-E-201
  ACTIVITIES REQUIRING MUCH READING 191 
the reading party. Both recitation and between- 
recitation periods were utilized for the work. 
The use of the between-recitation period: 
5 The teacher wrote on the board the titles of three re- 
view stories with the written direction to read the stories 
and select the one which would be best to read by parts 
or dramatize at the party. 
. The children were allowed to select and prepare any 
material found on the reading table. When a child 
felt that he could read a story sufficiently well, he was 
allowed to read it to the group just before dismissal in 
the afternoon. 
. The children were allowed to select for the party 
favorite reading units which had been printed on tag 
and placed in the reading corner. 
. New reading units sometimes appeared on the bulletin 
board and individuals or groups were encouraged to 
prepare these to read to the class. The class decided 
whether they should be read at the party or not. 
. After the regular work of the between-recitation period 
had been completed, the children were encouraged to 
go to the “Good News Corner” to see what items in 
regard to the party had been placed there. Use was* 
made of the following: 
John read better yesterday. 
Perhaps he can read at the party. 
Jack’s mother is coming to the party. 
She wants to hear Jack read. 
Sarah chose an interesting story. 
She is working hard on the story. 
Mary read well yesterday. 
Her reading was not jerky. 
The Reading Party is next week. 
How shall we make our room pretty?
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 HOW TO TEACH READING 
6. The children decided that instead of having all of the 
stories read aloud at the party, they would illustrate 
some. This called for re-reading of those stories in 
order to be able to illustrate them. 
7. To be sure that the guests would know what stories 
were illustrated, the children decided to write a short 
sentence explaining the illustration. This called for 
much practice in spelling and writing. 
8. Children who selected the same story for dramatiza- 
tion or reading by parts formed in groups and practiced 
the story. 
9. When a child thought he could read his story well 
enough to read before the entire class, he asked an 
individual or small group to listen to his story and 
criticize his reading. 
10. Many periods were spent in making room decorations 
suitable for the fall season, such as leaves, fruit, vege- 
tables. No patterns were used for this work. 
The use of the recitation period: 
In reading 
Greater interest was shown in the reading periods 
because each child wanted a place on the program. 
Standards of what constitutes good reading were 
developed and right habits of reading begun. 
Many reading units were developed in relation to 
the party, especially with the IB group. In many 
cases the vocabulary of the book was anticipated by 
the use of such units. 
In language 
The Reading Party furnished the material for both 
oral and written language work. Such topics were 
used as:

What stories shall we use at the Reading Party?

How shall we invite them? 
What shall we say in our invitation? 
What words will we need to learn to spell? 
What words must we practice writing? 
How shall we decorate our room? 
How shall we make our programs? 
How shall we care for our guests? 
How can we make our work better? 
In spelling 
The IA group practiced the spelling of words 
necessary for the writing of the invitation and the 
program. The IB group made the decorations for 
these. 
In writing 
After the form of the invitation had been decided 
upon and the children had learned how to spell the 
necessary words, the writing of words and difficult 
letters needed for the invitation was practiced during 
the writing period under the supervision of the teacher. 
Large unruled paper was used for this work. Finally 
the entire invitation was written. Extra invitations 
were made for the I B children. 
In the same way words needed for the program were 
practiced. The best one of each of the numbers was 
chosen and pasted upon large tag. Each child tried 
hard to have his good enough to be the one selected. 
In handwork 
The handwork periods were used to develop stand-

  ards of what constituted good decorations for the 
room, program, and invitation. The necessary 
technique was also developed. After the children’s 
attention was called to the essential characteristics 
of objects to be made for the room decorations such 
as the shape, color, and size of the elm leaves, they 
were allowed to experiment on the making of these. 
This work was followed by a check-up period in which 
standards of work were raised. 
While the I A children were writing the invitations, 
the I B children made the envelopes.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF READING 
MATERIALS 
Tue Use or Biacksoarp Lessons 
At the present time, the readers furnish excellent 
material for oral reading. In the lower grades there 
is, however, a lack of material which presents enough 
opportunities for the development of good silent 
reading habits. The teacher, trained in the psychol- 
ogy and pedagogy of reading, can supply this need 
through the use of blackboard lessons. 
No reader can possibly anticipate and make use of 
all the experience in the classrooms which furnish 
vital, interesting topics for reading lessons, such as 
the observance of holidays, excursions, and the work- 
ing out of activities. Many of these interesting situ- 
ations should be utilized, however. Blackboard 
units also furnish the opportunity for presenting in 
new thought associations the vocabulary that has 
not been mastered and for adding new words to the 
vocabulary.
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE USE OF BULLETIN BOARDS 205 
The teacher should be careful when formulating 
blackboard lessons to observe correct literary form, 
keeping in mind: 
1. A central thought for each unit. a 
2. An interesting beginning and an interesting ending 
sentence. 
. Correct sequence of sentences leading to the climax. 
. Good sentence structure. 
. Use of expressive words. 
. Correct capitalization, punctuation, and arrangement. > orm 09 
The method of presenting a blackboard unit would 
not differ materially from that used in developing a 
lesson in the book. For suggestive steps see page 177. 
Tue Use or Butiertin Boarps 
The bulletin board furnishes another opportunity 
to stimulate a desire and a love for reading, as it 
makes use of the interests and experiences of children 
at a given time. The nature of the material should 
vary during the year. Sometimes, as in the fall and 
the spring, it may be devoted to nature experiences; 
at other times, to activities, special holidays, or cur- 
rent events. The children should be held more 
responsible than in the first grade for the selection and 
arrangement of the material on the bulletin board. 
Committees can be appointed to bring in and arrange 
material or to choose the best material that has been 
brought in by different members of the class. 
The teacher should stimulate interest in and curi- 
osity about certain items on the bulletin board.

206 HOW TO TEACH READING 
Whenever a child or a group of children have dis- 
covered an interesting bit of information placed there 
and wish to share it with the rest of the group, they 
should be permitted to do so. 
Tue Use or Basa AND SuPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 
To utilize to the fullest extent the Psychological 
Principles governing reading, the following sugges- 
tions for the use of basal texts are given: 
1. The children should not be told the story they are to 
read as reading should be thought getting. We, as 
adults, are more eager to read unfamiliar material. 
The re-reading of familiar material should be in rela- 
tion to a definite need or motive. 
2. Dramatization should follow the reading of a story 
rather than precede it, as it furnishes one of the best 
motives for silent reading and check-up of silent read- 
ing. 
8. Children should have some motive for reading each 
lesson. 
4. Silent reading should usually precede any attempt at 
oral reading. 
5. In each selection there should be some material that is 
not read aloud. The thought of this portion may be 
checked through reproduction of the thought in the 
child’s own words or through action. 
6. Drill on words should be had, but it should be had 
largely when words are in context. Isolated words are 
rarely met with in life. 
7. The value of a period spent in just isolated word drill 
is to be questioned. 
8. Sentences, phrases, or words should be called for from 
the thought side.

B. Silent reading. 
At the beginning of ITB, a question calling for the 
reading of a group of sentences should be given. These 
questions should increase in scope as the child’s power 
develops until he is able to read silently, in relation to 
one question, a whole unit of the story or the entire 
selection. 
During the silent reading of the sentences, the teacher 
should be busy helping the children with their difficulties 
and correcting all undesirable habits. 
C. Enjoyment of the story and the check-up of silent read- 
ing, beginning II B. 
In addition to the motive question which should call 
for the reading of the entire selection or the portion to be 
used that day, other questions may need to be given 
which call for the reading of groups of related sentences. 
The answers to these questions should be given directly 
following the silent reading of that portion. Some of 
these questions will call for oral reading and some for the 
reproduction of the thought. Additional questions may 
be needed in order to be sure that the children have 
comprehended the thought and mastered the mechanics
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 HOW TO TEACH READING 
of this portion. When all of the unit for the period has 
been covered in this way, the motive question will have 
been answered. However, especial attention should be 
called to the finding of the answer to this question as it 
calls for the central thought of this unit. 
Sometimes the judgment questions should follow the 
question calling for the reading of that part; sometimes 
they should be given after the entire lesson has been 
read. 
Organization questions should follow the reading of 
the unit and call for re-reading or re-telling of related 
thoughts. 
Questions calling for drill which will fix the vocabulary 
should come at the close of the lesson. The following 
ways of securing drill may be suggestive: 
1. Have the children point to, or frame with their 
hands, the sentence, phrase, or word which tells a 
certain thing. 
2. Have the children read the sentence or phrase which 
tells a certain thing. 
8. Give an organization question whose answer will be 
a group of sentences. 
4, Have the children find the most difficult words in 
the lesson. 
5. Have the children read the part which they like best. 
6. Have the children find the new friends in the lesson. 
7. Have the children find the word as many 
times as they can on a page. 
8. Begin a sentence and have a child find that sentence 
and finish it. 
9. Have the children read as far as they need to in 
order to tell a certain part of the story. 
10. Have a number of children read conversational 
parts to see which can best represent the characters. 
11. Have the children take the parts of characters. 
12. Have the children read the sentences containing 
the new word eS 
13. Find the words on this page beginning with this 
sound. (The teacher gives the sound of “wh”). 
14, Find the words that belong to the “it” family.

  METHODS OF PRESENTING LESSONS 209 
D. Enjoyment of the story and the check-up of silent read- 
ing, later II B, II A, and III Grade. 
When the children have gained sufficient power to read 
an entire selection or unit of a selection in relation to one 
question which calls for the central thought, this question 
should be answered at the beginning of the check-up. 
Other questions calling for the thoughts presented in 
the story should be asked. These questions should 
increase in scope through the grade and be fewer in 
number, because the child should be able to keep larger 
units of thought in mind, and his ability to get thought 
need not be checked as much in detail. Some of these 
questions should call for the oral reading of passages. 
Children who need practice in oral reading should be 
given these questions. Other questions should call for 
the reproduction of the thought in the child’s own words. 
These should be asked the children who have difficulty in 
interpreting and expressing thoughts. 
Questions calling for the use of judgment should be 
given in each lesson. For suggestive questions see 
page 42. 
Variety in the check-up of silent reading is necessary. 
The nature of the material and the way it is to be used 
should regulate the type of check-up. Every type of 
procedure, however, should make use of questions calling 
for facts, judgment, organization, and drill on difficulties. 
The following procedures may be suggestive: 
1. Planning for a dramatization. 
2. Preparing an organization for the reproduction of a 
story. 
8. Formulating thought questions on the material. 
4. Illustrating the lesson by drawing, cutting, or 
modeling the main events or characters of the story. 
Words that give difficulty must be fixed. Both those 
dealt with in presenting universal difficulties and the 
individual ones noted by the teacher during the silent 
reading. For suggestive ways see page 48. 
E. Follow-up work. 
When much of the recitation time is spent in estab- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  210 HOW TO TEACH READING 
lishing correct reading habits and in checking the 
thoughts gained in silent reading, care should be 
taken to make further use of the material. The nature 
of the material will determine what this use should be. 
If the material is primarily of the silent reading type, 
the children can illustrate, cut, or model the main ideas 
of the story, its characters, or incidents. See “‘Indi- 
vidual Work in Reading for the Between-Recitation 
Period,” on page 117. If it is primarily oral reading 
material, another period will be necessary to give ade- 
quate training in oral reading. This re-reading, how- 
ever, should be in relation to some need. (See “‘ Oral 
Reading,” page 136.) Groups can practice reading 
aloud portions of the material, taking the part of differ- 
ent characters or dramatizing the story. (See “Group 
Work,” page 139.) . 
When it is best to spend another period on oral 
reading the following steps are suggested: 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction and motive. 
The introduction in this period would as a rule 
be the recall of the need for further practice in oral, 
reading which developed in the silent reading 
period. This need will furnish the new motive for 
the re-using of this material. 
For possible motives to be used see page 136. 
2. Review of difficulties. 
Some of the difficulties which were taken up in the 
silent reading lesson may need to be reviewed in 
order for good oral reading to be secured. 
8. Development of standards. 
Standards for good oral reading should be set 
up as: 
Making the audience see the pictures. 
Making the audience experience the humor, 
sadness, or excitement of certain passages. 
Making the audience feel that the real char- 
acter is talking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  a” 
METHODS OF PRESENTING LESSONS 211 
Reading with pleasing, easily understood 
voices. 
Enunciating clearly and pronouncing the words 
correctly. 
Reading smoothly. 
B. Oral reading. 
The type of oral reading done in this period will 
depend upon the kind of reading material used, the 
motive for reading, and the needs of the class. This 
period furnishes the opportunity to raise the standards 
and develop right habits of oral reading. The following 
types can be used: 
Reading to answer questions. 
These questions should call for the pictures, emo- 
tional passages, and conversations. The child should 
be held responsible for selecting the appropriate pas- 
sage in relation to the question asked and determining 
the necessary amount to be read. 
Taking the parts of characters. 
Many children should have the opportunity to take 
the part of various characters or the part of the book 
before any one is chosen for any special occasion. The 
“he said” and “she said” should be eliminated when 
the character is talking. 
Dramatizing with the book. 
In addition to reading the speeches of the char- 
acters, the selection of places in the room which will 
best represent the locations described in the book, the 
use of simple materials for necessary costumes and 
properties, and the interpreting of the part of the 
characters through action will lend variety and inter- 
est to the oral reading. This is excellent preparation 
for free dramatizations. 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
212 
  HOW TO TEACH READING 
Preparing for puppet shows. 
Practice in reading conversations makes possible 
better expression and language for use in puppet shows. 
Preparing for reproduction. 
Material rich in descriptive passages, but not dra- 
matic in its character, can be read aloud to get good 
expression and choice use of words in order that the 
reproduction of the story in the child’s own words may 
be improved. 
‘TRAINING IN THE ErrecTIveE. UsE or THE Book 
The habit of using the Table of Contents and Word 
Lists should be acquired by the constant use of them 
as occasions arise and not in isolated drills. 
I: Table of Contents. 
Beginning in I A Grade the children should have 
been taught to make use of the Table of Contents in 
finding the selections to be read. This habit should be 
continued. In order to avoid unnecessary waste of 
time it is often best for the teacher to call attention to 
the classification of the Table of Contents and some- 
times it is advisable to tell them under which heading 
the story will be found. 
. Word Lists (Third Grade only). 
In the third grade beginning should be made in the 
use of Word Lists. While the universal difficulties 
should be taken up by the teacher before the silent 
reading of the lesson, the children should be shown how 
they can use this list as an additional aid in the mas- 
tery of difficulties. To accomplish this the children’s 
attention should be called to the alphabetical arrange- 
ment of the words. Through the work in phonics the 
child already has a knowledge of phonograms involving 
the use of the long and short sounds of the vowels.
-P-A-G-E-223
             ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 213 
These sounds should be recalled and the appropriate 
diacritical marks added in order that he may be able 
to interpret the Word Lists.

Lesson Puan, II B 
The Fisherman and His Wife! 
(A portion of the story as adapted by Lila Baugh.) 
There was once a fisherman and his wife who lived in a 
little old hut by the sea. 
One day, when the fisherman was out fishing, his line 
suddenly went deep down into the water. When he pulled 
it up he found that he had caught a large flounder. 
The flounder began to talk to him and said: “I pray you, 
let me live. I am no flounder really. I am an enchanted 
prince. Put me into the water again and let me go.” 
The fisherman said: “I will gladly let you go. I do not 
want to eat a fish that can talk.” 
So he put the flounder back into the sea and went home to 
his wife in the little hut. 
When he went in, the wife said to him, “Did you catch 
any fish to-day?” 
“Yes,” said the fisherman; “I caught a large flounder who 
said he was an enchanted prince. So I put him back into 
the water.” 
“Didn’t you make a wish before you let him go?” asked 
the wife. 
“No,” said the fisherman; “what should I wish for?” 
“You should have wished for a cottage,” said the wife. 
“T do not like to live in this little hut. Go down to the sea 
and call him back. Tell him we should like to have him 
give us a cottage. I know he will be glad to do it.” 
“Why should I go and ask him for a cottage?” said the 
fisherman. “I do not like to do it.”

  214 HOW TO TEACH READING 
“But you must go,” said the wife. ‘‘He will be sure to 
give you what you ask because you put him back into the 
water.” 
The fisherman was very unwilling to go, but he went to 
please his wife. 
When he came to the sea it was green and yellow and very 
rough. He looked over the water and called: 
“Flounder, Flounder, in the sea, 
Come, I pray thee, here to me, 
For my good wife, Ilsabil, 
Wills not as I’d have her will 
And sends to ask a boon of thee.” 
Then the flounder came swimming up to him and said, 
“Well, what does your wife want?” 
“She wants a cottage,” said the fisherman. “She does 
not like to live in our little hut.” 
“Go home,” said the flounder. ‘You will find the 
cottage.” 
The fisherman went home and found that the hut had 
been changed to a pretty cottage. His wife met him at the 
door and said: “Isn’t this cottage much better than our 
little hut? Now we shall be happy.” 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
How many of you have ever wished for some- 
thing? What did you wish for? Did you get your 
wish? Did it make you happy? There is a story 
in our book of some one who made a number of 
wishes. What would you like to find out about 
this story? (What the wishes were.) 
2. Motive. 
Read and find out what the first wish was and if 
it brought happiness. 
8. Mastery of universal difficulties. 
When I went fishing last summer I caught — a 
large flounder. (The teacher writes the phrase in 
italics on the board.) What phonogram do you 
see in the last word? (ound) What does er say? 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 215 
What does fl say? Who will tell us what the phrase 
says? 
A fairy story. often has —an enchanted prince. 
Find a part of the second word you know. An- 
other part. Who knows the phrase? 
This is another name for a small house — a 
cottage. What small words do you see in the last 
word that you know? What is the phrase? 
This is the name of the man’s wife — Ilsabil. 
(The teacher tells the word.) 
This is another way of asking for a favor —a 
boon of thee. ‘The first word sounds like 
(Teacher writes soon on the board.) 
4. Setting up standards. 
When we read the story silently what shall we 
remember? (Read with lips still. Not point to 
words. Sit straight. Turn pages quietly and 
from upper right-hand corner.) 
5. Recall of motive. 
Who can tell what we are going to find out in our 
story? 
6. Passing out of material. 
(As there is no Table of Contents in either of these 
readers, give the page on which the story is found.)   
B. Silent reading. 
The motive question, as given, would call for the read- 
ing of a definite part of the selection. The children 
should stop reading when they have found the answer to 
this question. 
If the children haven’t sufficient power to read this 
amount in relation to one question, additional questions 
calling for smaller amounts should be given as shown in 
the Lesson Plan in First Grade on ‘‘Forest Rover,” 
page 185. 
During the silent reading of the material, give indi- 
vidual help on words. Check any movement of the lips 
and pointing with the finger. Notice healthful position 
of the body during the reading and the care of the book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  216 HOW TO TEACH READING 
C. Check-up of silent reading. 
(Books closed.) What was the first wish? How did 
the fisherman and his wife feel? Who gave them their 
wish? Why could he grant a wish? Why was he glad 
to grant the fisherman’s wish? Open your books and 
read what the flounder said when the fisherman caught 
him. (Have anumber read.) Read what the fisherman 
replied. 
(Close books.) What happened when the fisherman 
went home? Who would like to be the fisherman and 
read what he says? Who would like to take the part of 
the wife? (Have a number of children take these parts.) 
What kind of woman was Ilsabil? What kind of man 
was the fisherman? Read a part that proves your an- 
swer. How did the sea look when the fisherman re- 
turned? Why? Who would like to read what the fisher- 
man said? What the flounder said? What did the fish- 
erman find when he went home? How many pictures 
did you seein this part of the story? 
Find the words that tell what the fisherman caught. 
How many times do you find it on the page? Find the 
words that tell what the fish really was. Find the words 
that tell what Ilsabil wished for. 
Do you suppose they were happy in the cottage? To- 
morrow we will read and find out. 
D. Follow-up work. 
After the rest of the story has been read in a similar 
way, it could be read by parts or dramatized. 
Lesson Puan, III B 
The Tiger, The Brahman, and the Jackal * 
I 
Long, long ago when strange things happened, a tiger was 
caught in a trap. He tried in vain to break the bars, and 
rolled and frothed with rage because he failed. 
1 From The New Barnes Readers, Book Three: By permission of 
the publishers, Laidlaw Brothers.   
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 217 
Just by chance a poor Brahman came that way. 
“Let me out of this cage, O pious man!” cried the tiger. 
“Nay, nay, friend,” replied the Brahman, “you would eat 
me if I did.” 
“No, no, I would not,” swore the tiger. “Indeed, I 
should be so grateful that I would be your slave.” 
The tiger sighed and sobbed and swore till the pious 
Brahman’s heart softened and at last he opened the cage 
door. 
Out jumped the tiger and at once seized the poor man and 
cried, “What a fool you are! Don’t you know that I am 
frightfully hungry and I shall surely eat you?” 
The Brahman pleaded so feelingly for his life that the 
tiger at last said that he would leave the decision to the first 
three things the Brahman should choose. 
So the Brahman asked a fig tree to decide the matter, but 
the tree replied coldly, “You need not complain — I must 
shade and shelter all who pass by and what do they do but 
tear down my branches and trample them. Don’t weep and 
complain, be a man!” 
Then the sad Brahman put his case before a buffalo whom 
he saw turning a well wheel in the field. But his reply 
pleased the Brahman no better. 
Then the Brahman in great fear asked the road. 
““My good sir,” said the road, “you are foolish to expect 
better treatment. See my state — I am useful to all but am 
thanked by none.” 
II 
Then the Brahman turned sadly back and prepared to die. 
But on the way he met a jackal who called out, ‘Why, 
what’s the matter, my good man? You look as if you had 
lost your last friend.” 
The Brahman told him all that had happened. 
“How very confusing,” said the jackal. ‘‘Would you 
mind telling it over again? I don’t seem to understand how 
all this happened.” 
The Brahman told it all over again but the jackal seemed 
as confused as ever. “‘It’s very strange,” said he, shaking 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 HOW TO TEACH READING 
his head, “‘but it all seems to go in one ear and out of the 
other. Let us go to the place where it happened and then 
perhaps I will understand.” 
So they went to the cage where the tiger was waiting and 
found him sharpening his teeth. 
“You’ve been gone a long time,” growled the beast 
savagely, “‘but now I’ll begin my dinner.” 
“ Give me just five minutes,” pleaded the wretched Brah- 
man, “that I may explain matters to the jackal who is slow 
in understanding.” 
Tt 
The tiger at last consented and the Brahman told the 
story over again, not missing a single point and making the 
tale as long as possible. 
“Oh, my poor head! oh, my poor head!” cried the jackal. 
“Let me see! How did it all begin? You were in the cage, 
and the tiger came walking by.” 
“Nonsense,” cried the tiger, “how very foolish you are! 
I was in the cage.” 
“Of course,” cried the jackal, pretending to tremble, 
“yes, I was in the cage — no, I wasn’t — dear! dear! where 
are my brains? Let me see — the tiger was in the Brahman, 
and the cage came walking by — no, that’s not it either! 
Don’t mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never 
understand!” 
“Yes, you shall!” replied the tiger, in a rage, “I'll make 
you understand! I am the tiger!” 
“Yes, kind sir!” 
“And this is the Brahman!” 
“Yes, kind sir!” 
“And I was in the cage. Do you understand?” 
“Yes — no — please, kind sir!” 
“Please what?” cried the tiger angrily. 
“Please, kind sir, how did you get in?” 
“Why in the usual way, of course!” 
“But oh, dear me! My head is beginning to spin again! 
Please do not be angry, kind sir, but what is the usual way?” 
At this the tiger lost all patience, and jumping into the

  cage, cried, “‘This is the way! Now do you see how it was?” 
“Certainly!” smiled the jackal as he quickly shut the 
door, “and if you will allow me to say so I think you will 
remain where you are!” 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
    Yesterday you decided that you wished to drama- 
tize a story for the other Third Grade. What kind 
of a story is a good one to dramatize? (Exciting, 
many conversational parts, a number of characters, 
one we can really play.) 
. Motive. 
There is a story in our books that you may read 
and see if it is a good story to dramatize. 
. Mastery of universal difficulties. 
The difficulties chosen would depend upon the 
power of the class. The following are merely 
suggestive: 
The lion was angry and — frothed with rage. (The 
child who has difficulty with the phrase should be 
the one called upon to work out the word.) How 
does the phrase begin? What does the last part 
say? Now who can tell the phrase? 
A good man is sometimes spoken of as — a pious 
man. 
The little mouse — pleaded so feelingly that the 
lion let him go. What parts of these words do you 
know? Is there any one who cannot read this 
phrase? 
. Setting up standards. 
If you have trouble with other words what will 
you do? (Skip the word and come back to it. 
Sound the word. Ask for help.) 
. Recall of the motive. 
Read and find out if this story is a good one to 
dramatize. 
. Pass out material. 
Turn to the Table of Contents and find the story 
“The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal.”

  220 HOW TO TEACH READING 
B. Silent reading. 
While the children are reading silently, the teacher can 
help with individual difficulties or she can work with 
another group. See Method of Procedure, page 111. 
If the teacher is not working with the children they 
should keep a list of their difficulties and at the beginning 
of the check-up ask the teacher what they are. 
. Check-up of silent reading. 
Do you think this a good story to dramatize? Why? 
How many characters will we have to have? Name 
them. How many different places will we have to have 
represented? Where will be a good place to have these? 
Will we need any properties? 
How many scenes will we have to have? Where will 
the first scene take place? How many characters will 
talk in this scene? What will they say? (Treat the 
other scenes in a similar way.) 
. Follow-up work. 
In another recitation period, a number of children can 
try-out for the various characters, the class selecting the 
best ones to play before the other grade, or in a between- 
recitation period, small groups may form and practice 
the dramatization. The class can decide which children 
should take the parts the final afternoon. In addition 
to either of the above treatments, in a between-recita- 
tion period or in a language period, the children may 
plan additional conversations to use, especially in the 
first part of the story.

To ruffle up our wings! 
Well-tell! Where should I fly to, 
Where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell? 
Before a day was over, 
Home comes the rover, 
For mother’s kiss — sweeter this 
Than any other thing.   A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
How many of you have ever wished you were not 
a little boy or girl but something else? What did 
you wish to be? Why? In the poem we are going 
to read to-day, there are ever so many wishes made 
but it doesn’t tell who made them. What would 
you like to know about this poem? 
2. Motive. 
To find out who made the wishes and what they 
were. 
3. Mastery of universal difficulties. 
No difficulties need to be taken up by the teacher

before the children read. Have the children keep 
a list of the words they cannot get by themselves or 
ask the teacher during the silent reading. 
4. Setting up of standards. 
When the children seem to have formed desirable 
habits of reading, this step need not be taken up. 
5. Turn to the Table of Contents and find the title, 
“Wishing.” 
B. Silent reading. 
C. Check-up of silent reading. 
Whom do you think made the wishes? What makes 
you think so? How many wishes did she make? What 
were they? What did she finally decide she would rather 
be and why? What words gave you trouble? 
(Open your books.) Read the part that tells the first 
thing she wished to be. What kind of a primrose did 
she wish to be? Why is blowing a good word to use? 
How many reasons does the child give for wishing to be 
a primrose? Read the one you like the best. Who will 
read all the reasons given? Are there any good words in 
this part? 
Read the next wish. (Call attention to lofty and gay 
as was done with bright yellow.) How many reasons 
were given for desiring to be an elm tree? (Have 
reasons read.) 
Read the next wish. Read the reasons given for this 
wish. What does asked no leave or pardon mean? Are 
there any words here you especially like? What made 
her think perhaps she wouldn’t like to be a bird after all? 
What would she do? Why? What unusual word is 
used here? Why is it a good one? 
Why doesn’t the poet use the same beginning for each 
stanza? Close your eyes and see which wish you like 
the best as I read the whole poem. Look over the wish 
you like best and see if you can make me like it the best. 
(Have a number of children read the stanza selected.) 
Who will read the whole poem? (Teacher or a child 
reads it.)

D. Follow-up work. 
If the poem is to be used for any special occasion, such 
as “A Spring Party,” groups could form in the between- 
recitation period and practice reading the poem. The 
best one from each group could read the poem before the 
entire class, and the class decide which one should read 
it at the party.

The Fir Tree * 
(Reading-Literature, Second Reader) 
A little fir tree grew in the forest. The sun shone on 
it. The soft air kissed its leaves, and the dew watered its 
roots. 
“Be happy, O fir tree!” said the air. 
“Be happy, O fir tree!” said the sunshine. 
But the little fir tree was not happy. It took no joy in the 
warm sunshine. It did not hear the birds sing. It did not 
see the beautiful clouds above it. It wanted to be tall like 
the pine trees and spread out its branches. Then it could 
look out on the world and bow to its friends. 
One day some of the pine trees were cut down. The 
branches were cut off and the trunks were taken out of the 
forest. 
“Where are they going?” asked the fir tree. 
“T know,” said the swallow. ‘I saw them on great ships 
atsea. They were tall, stately masts, and they sailed over 
the seas.” : 
“JT wish I could go to sea,” said the little fir tree. “TI 
wish [ could sail over the seas.” 
“Be happy, O fir tree!”’ said the air. 
“Be happy, O fir tree!” said the sunshine. 
When Christmas time came many fir trees were taken out 
of the forest. 
“Where are they going?” asked the little fir tree. 
“T know,” said the swallow. “I saw them in the houses

in town. They stood in the middle of a warm room. They 
were covered with cakes and apples and candles and toys.” 
“Will they take me some time?” asked the fir tree. “I 
want to go.” 
“Be happy, O fir tree!” said the air. 
“Be happy, O fir tree!” said the sunshine. 
The next Christmas the little fir tree heard a man say, 
“This is the prettiest tree. Let us take it.” Then it was 
cut down and taken out of the forest. 
The little fir tree was carried into a big room, where every- 
thing was light and beautiful. Some ladies came in and 
hung dolls and bags of candies on its branches. They hung 
apples and nuts all over it. They put red, white, and blue 
candles on it. And at the top they hung a golden star. 
“‘How beautiful it is!” they said. 
At last it was night. The wax candles were lighted, and 
the little fir tree trembled with joy. 
Soon the door opened and the children came in. They 
shouted for joy when they saw the beautiful tree. And they 
danced about it with their new toys. 
After a while the candles burned out. Nothing was left 
on the tree but the golden star. The children went away 
and the little fir tree was left alone. Then it thought of the 
forest, the birds, and the flowers. 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
What did we decide that we must find for our 
Christmas Party? (A good story to tell.) What 
kind of a story should we have? (A Christmas 
story. An interesting story. One that will make 
us see pretty pictures.) 
2. Motive. 
There is a story in our books called “The Fir 
Tree” that might be a good one to tell. Read it 
and decide if you would like to tell this story at the 
party.

D. Follow-up work. 
Have the children form in small groups and 
practice telling the story, making use of the organ- 
ization which has been written on the board. 
Ways or Reviewine Marertau 
Special holidays and activities furnish excellent 
motives for the re-reading of selections to find one 
suited to the occasion. (See “Individual Work,” 
page 117.) 
Many stories can be used in more than one way. 
One group may dramatize the story while another 
group may be working on the reproduction of the 
story. (See ‘Group Work,” page 125.) 
Another interesting way of using familiar material 
is suggested in the Lincoln Readers, Book ITI, under 
the title “School Room Movies.” Each child is 
given a different paragraph in which he is told to 
represent a certain character found in one of the 
stories already read. Specific directions are also 
given as to what he shall do to represent the character. 
The paragraphs used should be of about equal length
-P-A-G-E-237
  
THE USE OF LIBRARY MATERIAL 227 
and difficulty. A time limit should be given for the 
silent reading of these. When time is up, the children 
are called upon to do what their paragraph said. The 
other children guess what character has been imper- 
sonated and which actor interpreted his part the best. 
Illustration from the Lincoln Readers, Book III+ 
You are an Indian. You may wear an Indian hat or a 
few feathers stuck in your cap. Over your shoulder is a 
broom-stick or a toy gun. You peer through the door. 
Then you step in cautiously and look about. You may spy 
the waste-paper basket and repeat the exclamation of 
Indian in the story of “The Two Brass Kettles.” You fire 
your gun — bang! and then take fright and run for the 
door. 
Tue Use or Lisrary Materia 
The object of the library table is to furnish children 
additional opportunity to enjoy books through 
handling them and selecting material that appeals to 
them. This table should be furnished with easy, 
carefully selected books not to be used in the recita- 
tion periods. There should be a wide range of books, 
not more than one or two copies of each. Besides 
books, there could be pictures with simple stories 
attached, stories cut from old readers and mounted 
on heavy cardboard, and reading units that have 
been developed in class. 
The children should be allowed to use this material 
before and after school, and at odd times during the

day. Sometimes a small group of children can be 
sent to the library table to find material suitable for a 
special occasion. Whenever individuals or groups 
wish to read material to the class which they have 
selected and carefully prepared, they should be 
allowed to do so. No other check-up of the reading 
of library material is advocated. The main object 
of the library table is accomplished if the children 
begin to love to browse in books. 
Puonics 
The phonograms met with most frequently in the 
basal and supplementary books should be developed. 
Consonant sounds and phonograms taken up in the 
First Grade should be reviewed and applied in the 
reading lessons in the identification of new words. 
A few simple rules should be worked out by the 
children. The teacher should study the treatment 
of Phonics on page 77 and apply the principles to her 
work.

A Flower Show 
(Second or Third Grade) 
Situation. The children had been very much 
interested in a Flower Show that had been held in the 
city, and wished to have a Flower Show in their room. 
The children selected all the material used for the 
show.
-P-A-G-E-239
  
ACTIVITIES REQUIRING MUCH READING 229 
Reading opportunities utilized. The teacher 
selected stories and poems in the basal and supple- 
mentary readers which were suitable for the show, 
and which the children had not read. These were 
read silently and the thought checked in the regular 
periods. The children decided what use could be 
made of these stories and poems at the flower show. 
Some of the stories were read by parts, some were 
dramatized, others were reproduced. The best of 
the poems were either read aloud or memorized. 
The children brought in extra material that they 
had selected and prepared at home. This material 
was read before the class and the class decided whether 
it was material they wanted used. 
The children were encouraged to see if there was 
any suitable material in the books on the library table. 
This was also prepared and given before the class. 
Material already read was re-read to see if it could 
be used for the show. Between-recitation periods 
were utilized in the selection and preparation of the 
material. 
Small groups were utilized in the between-recita- 
tion periods for: 
1. Practicing the reading of a story by parts. 
2. Dramatizing a story. 
8. Preparing a reproduction of a story. 
4. Practicing the reading of a poem. 
5. Practicing the reciting of a poem.

  AN ORIGINAL READING TEST 233 
Aw Oricrnat Reapine Test 
Situation. The children had been given informal 
tests in reading. In addition during the between- 
recitation periods they had been given silent reading 
material similar to that of the Haggerty Test. The 
teacher had used in the directions the vocabulary 
already developed, and had made enough _hecto- 
graphed copies for the class. Great interest had been 
aroused, especially when the teacher made class 
graphs of the results. One day the children were 
asked if they would like to write a test of their own 
to give to other members of the class. The sugges- 
tion met with an enthusiastic response. 
Planning for the making of the test. The teacher 
asked the children what they must be able to do in 
order to make a test. The following answers were 
given: 
“We must give good directions.” 
“We must not have the directions all the same.” 
“We must be able to spell the words used in the test.” 
“We must write well.” 
“We must draw the pictures well.” 
“We must know how to tell time.” 
“We must know how to score the test.” 
Many language periods were spent in giving, orally, 
directions which could be used for the test. Variety 
and originality were encouraged. The need for clear, 
well-constructed sentences was felt by the children. 
Excellent language training was secured in select- 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  284 HOW TO TEACH READING 
ing the spelling words needed and determining the 
writing difficulties. 
After the spelling and writing difficulties were suffi- 
ciently mastered, the children were allowed to write 
five directions for a test, keeping in mind the following 
points: 
1. Every sentence must begin with a capital letter. 
2. Every sentence that tells you to do something must 
end with a period. 
8. Every sentence that asks you something must end 
with a question mark. 
4. The margin must be even. 
In the check-up of these first directions the children 
were allowed to select the part of their test which they 
considered showed the best thought. Some of these 
were read orally, some were written on the board. 
All were criticized from the thought side first. Those 
written on the board were discussed from the addj- 
tional standpoints of spelling, writing, capitalization, 
punctuation, and form. In this way standards were 
raised and new needs in spelling and drawing arose. 
The children found that unless they could draw 
better the one taking the test would be unable to 
follow directions correctly. Good reading was also 
felt to be necessary. 
Making the test. When the children thought that 
they had practiced sufficiently, they made another 
test which was to be perfect enough to be given to 
another child in their own room. 
Giving the test. When the day came to give the
-P-A-G-E-245
  AN ORIGINAL READING TEST 235 
test each child chose the classmate whom he wanted 
to take his test. The child who had been selected as 
time keeper because of his ability to tell time, gave the 
necessary signals. When the test was finished it was 
returned to the child who made it and was corrected 
and scored. It was then returned to the child who 
had taken the test, and the child who had made it 
and scored it explained the mistakes. 
Accomplishments in reading. Practice in silent 
and oral reading was given in the check-up of the 
preliminary tests. The children felt the need of 
being able to find out exactly what the directions told 
them to do. As every child wanted to be able to 
finish the test on time, he felt the need of eliminating 
those habits that decrease speed, such as lip and head 
movements. Practicing for the test caused greater 
interest in reading at home and at the library table 
during the between-recitation period. 
Accomplishments in Language: 
Oral language: 
The development of originality in making the test. 
The use of clear, concise sentences. 
The correct use of: a and an, has and have, more and most. 
Written language: 
Capitalization: 
The use of a capital at the beginning of a sentence and 
in the child’s own name. 
Punctuation: 
The use of a period at the end of a sentence. 
The use of the comma in a series. 
The use of the apostrophe to indicate possession.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF READING 
MATERIALS 
In order that the teacher of these grades may 
accomplish the Objectives in Appreciations, Habits, 
and Skills, she must be familiar with the psychological 
principles governing the reading process which have 
been taken up in Part IT.  
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 HOW TO TEACH READING 
She must also know how to present reading mate- 
rial so that the desirable objectives can be accom- 
plished. In the first three grades the mechanics of 
reading have largely been mastered and some funda- 
mental habits have been established. It remains for 
the later grades to strengthen the habits already 
begun, to give special emphasis to the factors that 
produce speed, to develop good study habits, to teach 
children sources of information, and to train them 
how to use books effectively. 
At the beginning of each grade, the teacher should 
ascertain the reading abilities of the children in her 
class. She should note the pupils who need individual 
help, diagnose their difficulties and give remedial 
treatment. 
In these grades group work offers unlimited possi- 
bilities for the adaptation of the work to:the actual 
interests and needs of the children. As individual 
interests are becoming more pronounced at this 
period, a wide range of reading material should be 
provided. Children should have access to library 
and reference books in order to develop a love for 
reading, appreciations, high ideals, a wealth of 
information, and worth while interests. 
Tue Use or Basa AND SUPPLEMENTARY Books 
While an increased amount of library and reference 
reading is advocated for these grades, the use of some
-P-A-G-E-261
  
ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 251 
uniform material is necessary to develop and check 
standards and habits of good reading. The basal and 
supplementary books furnish such material. Great 
attention should be paid to provide subject matter 
along many lines and suitable for both silent and oral 
reading. The procedures to be followed in Silent and 
Oral Reading Lessons have been taken up in detail in 
Chapters VIII and IX. In order to understand the 
lesson plans that follow, the teacher should be per- 
fectly familiar with the preceding chapters.

The Jack-O’-Lantern 
(Everyday Classics, Fourth Reader) } 
The children had been working busily all day helping 
their father and mother with the harvesting. It would 
soon be Thanksgiving Day, and the nuts had to be gathered 
and stored away, the pumpkins and corn put into the barn, 
and the apples cut, strung, and hung up to dry. 
In the olden time, you see, the children had to work 
during the spring planting and the fall harvesting, and they 
went to school a little in the winter and summer. 
After supper the family gathered round the big fireplace 
in the kitchen — all but the father, who had gone to help 
a neighbor. 
“Let us string a few more apples,” said Endurance. 
“Father filled the baskets again this afternoon!” 
“Oh, no!” said Obed. ‘‘Let us make a jack-o’-lantern. 
I found a big yellow pumpkin and Father gave it to me.” 
“Yes, yes,” cried all the children. ‘‘Let us make a 
jack-o’-lantern!” and they watched with eager interest

  252 HOW TO TEACH READING 
while Obed cut off the top of the pumpkin and scooped out 
the seeds. 
““Now make two big eyes,”’ said Endurance, and Obed cut 
two round holes in the rind. Then he cut a long narrow 
opening. 
“What a big mouth!” said Patience. 
“The better to eat you with, my dear,”’ said one of the 
boys, as Obed added a nose and two ears. 
“Mother, Mother, may we have a candle? Our lantern 
is finished,” cried the children at last. 
Mrs. Moore found a bit of candle and lighted it. How 
the big eyes glared, and the mouth grinned! Truly, it was 
an ugly face. 
Just then a man came riding by. ‘‘The Indians, the 
Indians!” he cried. “They are coming up from the swamp. 
There is not time for you to go to the blockhouse.” 
“Take the children, Mother,” said Obed, “‘and hide them 
in the loft. Amos and I will stay here and watch for the 
Indians, and perhaps Father will come soon to help us.” 
In a moment the children were hidden, the fire was cov- 
ered, and the boys were peering out into the darkness. 
“Look, look!” whispered Amos, “there is a shadow 
behind that tree. I think it is an Indian.” Then, as he 
saw the shadow move, he spoke again. “Let us try to 
scare him, Obed. The jack-o’-lantern, quick!” 
The jack-o’-lantern was lighted and set in the window. 
It moved its head from side to side. It glared and stared 
into the night. It disappeared and appeared again. 
The Indian saw its shining eyes, its grinning mouth, and 
he fled through the woods in terror. 
“The fire spirit! The fire spirit!” he called to his com- 
rades, and they hurried with him back to the swamp. 
All night long Obed kept the jack-o’-lantern in the 
window, but the Indians never dared to return to the abode 
of the great fire spirit. 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
How many of you have ever made a jack-o’- 
lantern? What did you do with it? 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 253 
There is a story in our readers in which a jack-o’- 
lantern was used for a strange purpose. What do 
you want to find out? 
2. Motive. 
To find out for what purpose the jack-o’-lantern 
was used. 
8. Mastery of universal difficulties. 
The children should be held responsible for 
mastering their difficulties individually or asking 
for help. 
4, Setting-up of standards. 
What are you going to be careful about as you 
read? 
The first child in each row who finishes may write 
the names of the children in his row in the order 
in which they finish. 
5. Recall of motive. 
This step is not necessary here as the motive 
question is still fresh in the children’s mind. 
6. Passing out material. 
This step can be omitted as children in these 
grades should have sufficient control to refrain 
from handling the book on the desk.   
B. Silent reading. 
The children now open their books and find the story, 
“The Jack-o’-Lantern” in the Table of Contents and 
begin reading silently. The teacher gives individual 
help when needed, checks reading habits, and attends to 
the needs of the groups that may be working in various 
parts of the room during their study period. 
C. Check-up. 
For what purpose was the jack-o’-lantern used? Why 
were the Indians frightened? When did this story take 
place? What had the children been doing all day? 
Would you rather have lived in the “‘Old Colonial Days” 
or now? Why? 
What were the children doing that evening? As they 
finished the jack-o’-lantern what happened? What

kind of boys were Obed and Amos? Read the part that 
proves that the adjective you used is correct. 
Did you have to look up any words in the word lists? 
What were the words? What parts in this story are 
good for oral reading? How shall we read these? What 
is the most exciting part? The most interesting part? 
(Have the children who finished first read the names of 
the children in the order in which they finished reading. 
Commend improvement in rate of reading. Show the 
children why they did not finish earlier.) 
D. Follow-up work. 
What would you like to do with this story? During 
the next study period you may form in groups and plan 
how to dramatize the story, then practice it. 
Another possible check-up and follow-up of this 
material: 
C. Check-up. 
For what purpose was the jack-o’-lantern used? 
‘Would this be a good story to tell at our Thanksgiving 
party? What will help us tell it? 
What did the first part of the story tell us about? 
Tell this in a short sentence. (Have a number of chil- 
dren do this. Have the children choose the best sen- 
tence. Write it on the board.) What part of the story 
would you call this? (Introduction.) What details 
would you want to bring out in telling this introduction? 
Show in your books where the next part of the story 
ends. What is the main thought in this part? Tell that 
in asentence. (Treat as before.) Describe the making 
of the jack-o’-lantern. Sarah, choose the characters to 
read the different parts. 
What is the last part of the story? (Let this be told 
in a sentence and after a number have been given, write 
the one chosen as the best on the board.) What kind 
of boy was Obed? Amos? Prove your adjective was 
correct. 
Look over the story and see if there are any good words 
you wish to use in telling the story.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 255 
D. Follow-up work. 
Have the children form in groups and practice the 
telling of the story, making use of the organization on 
the board. Recall points to keep in mind in telling a 
story as: 
1. An interesting beginning and an interesting ending 
sentence. 
2. The use of variety in beginning sentences. 
8. Good sentence structure. 
4. Choice of words.

Rock-a-by, Hush-a-by, Little Papoose + 
(By Charles Myall) 
Rock-a-by, hush-a-by, little papoose, 
The stars come into the sky, 
The whip-po’-will’s crying, the daylight is dying, 
The river runs murmuring by. 
The pine trees are slumbering, little papoose, 
The squirrel has gone to his nest, 
The robins are sleeping, the mother bird’s keeping 
The little ones warm with her breast. 
The roebuck is dreaming, my little papoose, 
His mate lies asleep at his side, 
The breezes are pining, the moonbeams are shinin 
All over the prairie wide. 
Then, hush-a-by, rock-a-by, little papoose, 
You sail on the river of dreams; 
Dear Manitou loves you and watches above you 
Till time when the morning light gleams.

  256 HOW TO TEACH READING 
A. Preparation. 
1. Introduction. 
You have been eens about Indians. What is 
the Indian baby called? What is one of the strangest 
customs in caring for the papoose? Have you ever 
thought about what the Indian mother would sing 
as she rocks her baby to sleep? Would you like to 
know? 
2. Motive. 
Let us read the poem “Rock-a-by, Hush-a-by, 
Little Papoose” and find out. 
B. Silent reading. 
The children find the story in the Table of Contents 
and read silently to find the answer to the motive 
question. 
C. Check-up. 
What did the Indian mother sing about? Why did 
she sing about these things? 
What does the first stanza tell about? (Twilight has 
come.) Read the reasons that make you think so. Why 
would the papoose hear a whip-po’-will? What word 
has a sleepy sound? 
What does the second and third stanzas tell about? 
(All the little things have gone to sleep.) Read the 
reasons the Indian mother gives for the papoose going to 
sleep. Are there any especially good words used in 
these stanzas? 
What does the last stanza tell? (The baby will be 
safe.) Why does the Indian mother say the baby will be 
safe? What does it mean to sail on the river of dreams? 
Who is Manitou? Read what Manitou will do. Why 
do you think the papoose should sleep well during the 
night? 
Close your eyes and try to see the different pictures 
as I read the poem. (Teacher reads the poem.) How 
does the poem make you feel? Why? What part of 
the poem do you like best? What kind of a voice did 
the Indian mother use? Read the part you like best.

(Have a number of children read.) Who would like to 
read the whole poem? 
D. Follow-up work. 
If further use is to be made of the poem, the children 
can practice reading it in small groups during a study 
period.

The Fox and the Cock + 
Once there was a barnyard close to a wood, in a little 
valley. Here dwelt a cock, Chanticleer by name. His 
comb was redder than coral, his feathers were like burnished 
gold, and his voice was wonderful to hear. Before dawn 
each morning his crowing sounded over the valley, and his 
seven wives listened in admiration. 
One night as he sat on the perch by the side of Dame 
Partlet, his most loved mate, he began to make a curious 
noise in his throat. 
“What is it, my dear?” said Dame Partlet. “You sound 
frightened.” 
“Oh!” said Chanticleer, “I had the most horrible dream. 
I thought that as I roamed down by the wood a beast like a 
dog sprang out and seized me. His color was red, his nose 
was small, and his eyes were like coals of fire. Ugh! It 
was fearful!” 
“Tut, tut! are you a coward to be frightened by a dream? 
You’ve been eating more than was good for you. I wish my 
husband to be wise and brave!” Dame Partlet clucked, as 
she smoothed her feathers, and slowly closed her scarlet eyes. 
“Of course you are right, my love, yet I have heard of 
many dreams which came true. I am sure I shall meet 
with some misfortune, but we will not talk of itnow. Iam 
quite happy to be here by your side. You are very beauti- 
ful, my dear!” 
Dame Partlet unclosed one eye slowly and made a pleased 
sound, deep in her throat.

The next morning, Chanticleer flew down from the perch 
and called his hens about him for their breakfast. He 
walked about boldly, calling, ‘“‘Chuck! chuck!” at each 
grain of corn which he found. He felt very proud as they all 
looked at him so admiringly. He strutted about in the 
sunlight, flapping his wings to show off his feathers. His 
dream was forgotten. 
Now all this time, Reynard, the fox, was lying hidden in 
the bushes on the edge of the wood bordering the barnyard. 
Chanticleer walked nearer and nearer his hiding place. 
Suddenly he saw a butterfly in the grass, and as he stooped 
toward it, he spied the fox. 
“Cok! cok!” he cried in terror, and turned to flee. 
“Dear friend, why do you go?” said Reynard in his 
gentlest voice. “I only crept down here to hear you sing. 
Your voice is like an angel’s. Do you remember your 
father’s singing? I can see him now as he stood on tiptoe, 
stretching out his long slender neck, sending out his glorious 
voice. He always flapped his wings and closed his eyes 
before he sang. Won’t you sing just once and let me hear 
you? I am so anxious to know if you really sing better 
than your father.” 
Chanticleer was so pleased with this flattery that he 
flapped his wings, stood up on tiptoe, shut his eyes, and 
crowed as loudly as he could. 
No sooner had he begun than Reynard sprang forward, 
caught him by the throat, threw him over his shoulder, and 
made off toward his den in the woods. 
The hens made a loud outcry when they saw Chanticleer 
being carried off, so that the people in the cottage near by 
heard and ran out after the fox. The dog heard and ran 
yelping after him. ° The cow ran, the calf ran, the pigs began 
to squeal and run too. The ducks and geese quacked in 
terror and flew up into the tree tops. Never was there 
heard such an uproar. Reynard began to feel a bit fright- 
ened himself. 
“How swiftly you do run!” said Chanticleer from his 
back. “If I were you I should have some sport out of 
those slow coaches who are trying to catch you. Call out to 
them and say, ‘ Why do you creep along like snails? Look! 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
     ILLUSTRATIONS OF READING LESSONS 259 
I am far ahead of you and shall soon be feasting on this 
cock in spite of all of you!’” 
Reynard was pleased at this and opened his mouth to call 
to his pursuers; but as soon as he did so, the cock flew away 
from him and perched up in a tree. 
The fox saw he had lost his prey and began his old tricks 
again. “Iwas only proving to you how important you are in 
the barnyard. I did not mean to frighten you. Come down 
and we will go along to my home. I have something inter- 
esting to show you.” 
“No, no,” said Chanticleer. ‘You do not catch me again. 
A man who shuts his eyes when he ought to be looking de- 
serves to lose his sight entirely.” 
By this time, Chanticleer’s friends were drawing near, 
so Reynard turned to flee. “The man who talks when he 
should be silent deserves to lose what he has gained,” he 
said as he sped away through the wood.

A Newspaper Story: Verdun Belle 
War Doge Farrurvun to Marine 
Verdun Belle, Refugee Setter, Loses American Master 
on the March, to Find Him Again in Hospital. 
“This,” says the Stars and Stripes, the daily newspaper 
published in France by the American Expeditionary Force, 
“is the story of Verdun Belle, a trench dog who adopted a 
young leatherneck, of how she followed him to the edge of 
the battle around Chateau Thierry, and was waiting for him 
when they carried him out. It is a true story. 
“Belle is a setter dog,” the Stars and Stripes goes on, 
“shabby white, with great splotches of chocolate brown in 
her coat. Her ears are brown and silken. Her ancestry is 
dubious. She is undersize and would not stand a chance 
among the haughtier breeds they show in splendor at Madi- 
son Square Garden back home. But the marines think 
there never was a dog like her.” 
The story tells how Belle bobbed up out of nowhere in a 
sector near Verdun, singled out a young private of marines 
and attached herself to him. ‘‘Belle was as used to war as

the most weather-beaten poilu. The tremble of the ground 
did not disturb her and the whining whirr of the shells 
overhead only made her twitch and wrinkle her nose in her 
sleep. She was trenchbroken. You could have put a plate 
of savory pork chops on the parapet and nothing would 
have induced her to go after them.” 
She actually learned to race for the spot where an impro- 
vised gas mask contrived by her master could be put over 
her nose whenever the signal warning of a gas attack was 
sounded. 
Belle’s Puppies 
Before long Belle became the mother of seven brown and 
white puppies. They had hardly opened their eyes before 
the marines’ regiment got orders to “hike” for another 
sector. Some might have thought the dog and her pups 
would be left behind, but this never occurred to her master. 
He commandeered a market basket somewhere, put the 
pups into it and let Verdun Belle trot behind. 
In spite of the fact that the amount of equipment which 
each marine carries on the march is supposed to be all that 
a man can possibly carry, this marine somehow found 
strength to carry the extra weight of the basket. Forty 
miles he carried his burden along the parched French high- 
way. But then came an order to march even farther and 
reluctantly the marine was forced to give up the basket. 
Mouwrnfully he killed four of the puppies, but the other three 
he slipped into his shirt front. 
“Then he trudged on his way, carrying these three, 
pouched in forest green, as a kangaroo carries its young, while 
the mother dog trotted trustingly behind.” 
Belle is Lost 
Another of the pups died on the long march, and some- 
where in the tremendous procession of marching men and 
the endless lines of trucks and wagons Belle herself got lost. 
The marine was at his wits’ end to keep the two puppies 
alive. Finally he hailed the crew of an ambulance passing 
back from the front, turned the pups over to them, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 HOW TO TEACH READING 
disappeared with his comrades. The ambulance men were 
unable to induce the pups to eat canned beef and they had 
no fresh milk. They chased a couple of cows vainly. 
“Next morning the problem was still unsolved. But it 
was solved that evening. For a fresh contingent of marines 
trooped by the farm and in their wake — tired, anxious, but 
undiscouraged — was Verdun Belle. Ten kilometers back, 
two days before, she had lost her master, and until she 
should find him again she evidently had thought that any 
marine was better than none. 
“The troops did not halt at the farm, but Belle did. At 
the gates she stopped dead in her tracks, drew in her lolling 
tongue, sniffed inquiringly the evening air and like a flash — 
a white streak along the drive — she raced to the distant 
tree where, on a pile of discarded dressings in the shade, 
the pups were sleeping. 
“All the corps men stopped work and marveled. It was 
such a family reunion as warms the heart. For the worried 
mess sergeant it was a great relief. For the pups it was a 
mess call, clear and unmistakable.” 
Belle Finds Her Master 
So with only one worry left in her mind Verdun Belle 
settled down with her puppies at this field hospital. In a 
day or two the wounded began coming in, a steady stream. 
Always a mistress of the art of keeping out from under foot, 
very quietly Belle hung around and investigated each am- 
bulance that turned in from the main road and backed up 
with its load of pain. 
“Then one evening they lifted out a young marine, list- 
less in the half stupor of shell shock. To the busy workers 
he was just case number such and such, but there was no 
need to tell any one who saw the wild jubilance of the dog 
that Verdun Belle had found her own. 
“The first consciousness he had of his new surroundings 
was the feel of her rough pink tongue licking the dust from 
his face. And those who passed that way last Sunday found 
two cots shoved together in the kindly shade of a spreading 
tree. On one the mother dog lay contented with her pup-

pies. Fast asleep on the other, his arm thrown out so that 
one grimy hand could clutch one silken ear, lay the young 
marine.” 
It perplexed some of the hospital workers to know what 
could be done when the time came to send the marine on to 
the base hospital. ‘But they knew in their hearts they 
could safely leave the answer to some one else. They could 
leave it to Verdun Belle.”

Why Switzerland is the Favorite Country in Europe for 
Tourists 1 
Switzerland, in the center of Europe, is often called the 
playground of that continent and America because so many 
tourists go there to enjoy the scenery and climate. In the 
lofty Alps is some of the grandest scenery in the world. 
The mountains, rising in the path of the west winds, cause a 
very heavy rainfall, much of which turns to snow and ice. 
The many snow-covered peaks, being so white and high, 
look like distant clouds. The great quantities of snow have 
formed glaciers, which move slowly down the valleys like 
rivers of ice. Below the snow line the ice melts, and streams 
and lakes are numerous. The lower slopes are fertile, and 
in spring and summer the grass-covered valleys are brilliant 
with flowers. 
The high altitude gives Switzerland a cool climate, and 
tourists enjoy especially the outdoor life. The dry, bracing

air is also helpful, so that many go there to regain their 
health. One of the chief pleasures is mountain-climbing, 
which is sometimes dangerous as well as exciting. Many 
persons spend their winter vacations there in order to take 
part in such sports as skating, skiing, and tobogganing. 
The Ascent of Mont Blane 
Only the most sturdy people can climb the higher moun- 
tains, for it is a difficult and dangerous task. Mont Blanc, 
the highest peak in the Alps, is often chosen for this sport. 
What is its height? Though its summit is just across the 
border in France, its lower slopes are in Switzerland and the 
climb is started in that country. Strangers wishing to climb 
it dare not go alone; they must employ guides, to show them 
the way and help them over the worst places. 
The round trip usually takes two nights and three days; 
and as there is no place to obtain food, it is necessary to 
carry it. Overcoats and blankets are also needed; for even 
though the journey be made in the hottest summer weather, 
it is bitterly cold upon the mountain top. 
Suppose that we are making such a journey. We start 
early in the morning, so as to have a long day. Each of us 
carries a few light articles, but the guides and porters take 
most, for they are strong and used to climbing. At first we 
walk along a pleasant path in a beautiful wood; now and 
then a house is passed, and perhaps a green field, but soon 
there are no more houses or tilled fields, and we meet no 
people. The trees become smaller and smaller, until the 
line is reached above which it is so cold that no trees can 
grow. ‘This is called the tree line or timber line. 
From this point on, no plants larger than bushes are seen, 
and after a while even these disappear. Meanwhile the 
soil and grass have become more scarce, while here and there 
banks of snow are found in the shady hollows. Soon 
we have climbed to the snow line. This is the line above 
which snow is found all the year round. Now, no mat- 
ter in what direction we look, rocks and snow are every- 
where to be seen, and the snow is often twenty or more feet 
in depth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  266 HOW TO TEACH READING 
What a wonderful view is before us! It repays us for all 
the hard work. We look down upon the woods through 
which we have just passed, and over them to the deep val- 
leys, with the green fields, pretty houses, and villages far 
below us. Beyond are seen other steep mountains on the 
opposite side of the valley. 
A guide takes his place in front of us, and often tells us 
to stop while he goes ahead to examine the way. It may be 
that the snow has bridged over and hidden a deep and 
narrow chasm, and if we were to step upon this snow bridge, 
we might break through and fall a hundred feet or more. 
Sometimes the guides lift us over a dangerous place; and 
when it is steep or slippery, they fasten all the members of 
the party together with ropes, so that if one starts to fall, 
the others may hold him. 
As we advance higher and higher, it is often necessary to 
take a narrow path on the steep side of the mountain. On 
the right we can look hundreds of feet almost straight down- 
ward; on the left are huge stones and masses of snow almost 
directly overhead. 
The snow sometimes slips, forming snowslides, or ava- 
lanches, which are very dangerous. They come tearing 
down the sides of the mountains with a terrible roar, at 
times burying whole villages beneath them. You have seen 
the same thing, on a much smaller scale, when snow has slid 
from the roofs of houses on warm winter days. 
After one night spent in a little house about halfway up 
the mountain side, and after much hard work on the next 
day, we reach the summit. Here, in spite of our heavy 
wraps, we are all shivering, for it is freezing cold upon high 
mountain tops and there are often fierce winds which seem 
to go through even the thickest clothing. 
On this barren mountain top there are no birds, no trees, 
no grass — nothing but snow and rock. But if it is a clear 
day and there are no clouds clinging to the mountain sides 
below us, we may be able to look down into the beautiful 
green valleys only a few miles away. There the birds are 
singing, flowers are blooming, and men working in the fields 
are complaining of the heat.

Importance of the Tourist Industry to Switzerland 
Before the World War more than 3,000,000 persons 
visited Switzerland each year. Probably on the average 
each spent not less than $50 orf hotel bills, railroad fares, 
and amusements while in the country. You can estimate, 
therefore, the amount of money their visits brought to 
Switzerland. 
It is known that considerably over one third of this sum 
was spent on hotel bills alone. No wonder that the accom- 
modation of tourists ranks as a great industry there! There 
are over 9000 Swiss hotels, many of them in the mountains 
where the scenery is the grandest. The number of people 
employed is second only to the number employed in the 
largest Swiss industry, the manufacture of machinery and 
instruments. 
Attractions of Lucerne 
Among the many beautiful Swiss towns Lucerne, on the 
lake of the same name, is one of those most often visited. 
Locate it on Fig. 201. Near by are two famous mountains, 
Rigi and Pilatus. From their summits one obtains magnifi- 
cent views of the lake, over 4000 feet below, bordered by 
green meadows and numerous villages. In several direc- 
tions, as far as the eye can reach, are the snow-covered 
crests of lofty mountains shining in the sunlight or lost in 
the clouds. 
Chief Industries in the Cities 
Another beautiful city is Geneva, on a large lake of that 
name in the midst of the Alps. It is especially noted for its 
fine watches. In northern Switzerland is Zurich, the largest 
city, on Lake Zurich, and Basel, at the point where the 
Rhine enters Germany. All three of these cities have good 
water or railroad connections, and are manufacturing cen- 
ters, producing textiles, jewelry, scientific instruments, and 
dairy products. Perhaps you have seen a Swiss watch or 
carved cuckoo clock. The next time you buy milk choco- 
late see if it bears a Swiss brand.

Leading Kinds of Farming 
The best farmlands of Switzerland are on the plateau 
lying between the Jura Mountains on the north and the 
Alps on the south. In the valleys of that region cereals, 
vegetables, and fruits are raised. The mountain slopes 
afford excellent pasturage, and dairying is far more impor- 
tant than other kinds of farming. In the early spring the 
cattle, sheep, and goats are driven up the slopes of the 
valleys as the snow and ice melt and new grazing lands are 
exposed. Such a pasture is called an alp, and from it the 
chief mountains have received their name. The herders 
remain far up in the mountains all summer, living in log 
huts, watching the flocks and making cheese from the milk. 
In the fall the herds are driven back to the valleys to be 
stall-fed during the winter. What pleasures and hardships 
do you see in the life of a herder in this mountainous country?

Tue Uss or Books on tHe Home Reapine List 
The children should be encouraged to read many 
books at home. They should also read from a variety 
of authors instead of spending their time on popular 
series of books. The Home Reading list is to suggest 
books along many lines and from many authors. 
The manner in which the list is presented will deter- 
mine to a large extent the children’s desire to read 
these books. The list should not be presented as a 
task to be performed, but should be given as a list of 
books that other children have enjoyed reading. 
The use of small groups offers increased opportu- 
nities for meeting individual interests and tastes. 
Reports on home reading can be given in groups. 
Library books furnish excellent material for this work. 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
    270 HOW TO TEACH READING 
Suggestions for the use of library books by small 
groups have been given on page 127. 
Occasionally a recitation period can to advantage 
be devoted to individual reports on books read at 
home. These reports should not be of a formal nature 
but should give the children an opportunity for the 
teacher to stimulate the children to do much outside 
reading, to guide them in the choice of books, and to 
help them understand what one should get from a 
book. 
The teacher in the upper grades will find some 
children who have acquired such efficient habits of 
reading that they no longer need the training that 
must be given to the major portion of the group. 
These children should be excused from the reading 
recitation period and allowed to read additional 
library books or reference material. Instead of doing 
individual reading, they might form in a small group 
and read a library book. 
Tur Use or Rererence Materia 
Newspapers. ‘Training in efficient reading of a 
newspaper should be given in the upper grades. 
Children should early form the habit of reading a 
good newspaper which is one of the most effective 
means of molding public opinion. The use of such 
papers as Current Events and the Pathfinder furnish 
an excellent introduction to this type of reading. 
Children should be encouraged to bring in good
-P-A-G-E-281
pO THE USE OF REFERENCE MATERIAL 271 
newspapers and class periods should be devoted to 
the proper reading of these. Children should be 
taught to scan the headlines, and leads, and the sub- 
titles in order to select material which is worth while 
and interesting. It is not necessary or advisable to 
read all articles or the whole of any one article. This 
is excellent training in judgment and requires of 
reading the skip and skim method. The children 
should know where to look for the most important 
items in the paper and where to find editorials. News- 
papers furnish needed information concerning histori- 
cal and geographical problems which the children are 
working out. 
Texts and reference books on other subjects. 
Textbooks in all subjects, reference books, and maga-   zines furnish excellent material for reading lessons. 
Greater selectiveness is necessary in the use of this 
material than that of the literary type. The material 
in these books is primarily of an informational type, 
so should be read silently with a definite question in 
mind. The check-up of such reading would depend 
upon the purpose for which one is reading. Much 
training in this type of reading must be given in order 
that the habits developed in literary material should 
be carried over to the informational and factual type 
of material which is most frequently dealt with in life. 
The class period in reading should often be spent in 
doing the reading necessary to solve a problem in 
another subject. Every period in which the child

makes use of a book should be regarded as a reading 
period.

In the middle and upper grades greater responsi- 
bility should be borne by the children for the selec- 
tion of the material and the placing of it on the bulle-

sible for the bringing in of material, or committees can 
be appointed to pass upon material brought in by the 
whole group. 
To stimulate the desire and love for reading, the

education is being used more and more as a means

books.

  EFFECTIVE USE OF A BOOK 273 
‘TRAINING IN THE Errective Uss or 4 Book 
1. Table of Contents. 
Beginning in the IA Grade the children have been 
taught to make use of the Table of Contents in finding 
the selections to be read. The habit should be fairly 
well established by this time. In order to avoid un- 
necessary waste of time, it is often best for the teacher 
to call attention to the classification of the Table of 
Contents and sometimes it is even advisable to tell 
them under what heading the story will be found. 
Attention should be called to the fact that in finding 
a selection they should glance at the first part of the 
titles in the Table of Contents to see if they correspond 
to the first part of that for which they are looking. It 
is not necessary or advisable to read every title in its 
entirety. 
2. Word List and Glossary. 
The child in these grades should be held more 
responsible for the independent mastery of his word 
difficulties. This requires a greater and more effective 
use of the Word List or Glossary. To develop this 
ability, more attention should be given to the order of 
letters in. the alphabet. In looking up the words not 
only the first letter of the word has to be observed, 
but even the second and third, in order to know where 
to find the words quickly in the word lists. Real need 
for such work will arise daily in the reading and geog- 
raphy periods. 
Continued attention should be given to the sounds 
of consonants and the long and short sounds of the 
vowels with their appropriate diacritical marks in or- 
der for the child to be able to interpret the re-spelling 
of the words in the Glossary. The child should make 
use of the key to sounds of marked vowels to interpret 
all other diacritical marks. 
The child should be held more responsible for accent- 
ing the proper syllable of words although the teacher
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 HOW TO TEACH READING 
should continue to help him. More attention should 
be called to the syllabication of words than in the 
previous grade. 
. Chapter headings. 
Children should be made conscious of the function of 
chapter headings. Organization questions used in all 
the grades have laid the foundation for the under- 
standing of the use of chapter headings. 
. Marginal headings. 
The children’s attention should be called to the 
function of the marginal headings. The children 
should form the habit of relying upon these, as marginal 
headings are most helpful in the use of geographies, 
encyclopedias, and all reference books. 
TRAINING IN THE Errective UsE oF A 
Dictionary 
. The Small Dictionary. 
Through the use of the word list, the child has 
become familiar with the alphabetical arrangement of 
words, the use of diacritical marks, syllabication, and 
accent. This has given valuable training which can 
be utilized in dictionary work. The following addi- 
tional features must be developed: 
a. The use of running titles. 
Emphasize the use of running titles for securing 
speed in looking up words. The children should 
know that the word above the first column is the 
first word in the page; the word above the second 
column is the last word on that page.. Children 
should form the habit of relying upon these run- 
ning titles. 
b. Preferred pronunciation. 
In the glossaries only one pronunciation has 
been given, in the dictionaries two are sometimes 
given. The child should be taught that the first 
pronunciation given is the one preferred.
-P-A-G-E-285
  EFFECTIVE USE OF A DICTIONARY 275 
c. Meaning of words. 
Up to this time no selection of the appropriate 
meaning of a word has been necessary as only one 
meaning, as a rule, has been given in the glossa- 
ries. In dictionary work, the child has to con- 
sider the different meanings given and decide by 
a study of the context which one is the “‘mean- 
ing that fits.” 
d. The singular form. 
Children should be taught to look for the 
singular form of nouns. 
e. The key to pronunciation. 
In the glossaries the key to pronunciation has 
preceded the word lists; the child’s attention must 
be called to the different placing of this key in the 
dictionary. It is found at the bottom of each 
page. 
2. The Large Dictionary. 
Encourage the pupils to use the large dictionary for 
information not contained in their desk copy. Pic- 
tures, diagrams, geographical and biographical names 
found in the Unabridged Dictionary are especially 
helpful. The children should be taught where and 
how to find these. Attention should be called to the 
fact that probably all the words the child needs to 
look up will be found above the black, horizontal line 
that divides the page. Only unusual and obsolete 
words are found below the line. The child should be 
taught to look below the line on the same page when 
unable to find the word above the line. 
The child should continue to use the small diction- 
ary for the meanings of words, as the unabridged edi- 
tion has so many definitions that confusion is likely to 
result.

Activities Necessiratine Mucu Reapine 
Christmas in Many Lands 
Situation. When Christmas filled the air a fourth- 
grade class became interested in telling each other 
how Christmas is celebrated in their homes. This 
led to finding the different ways in which Christmas 
is observed in America. Much reading was required 
to get this information. A language period was spent 
in working out an organization of the material brought 
in by the children. After much discussion the follow-
-P-A-G-E-287
   ACTIVITIES REQUIRING MUCH READING 277 
ing main points were selected to guide them in their 
oral and written work. 
The decoration of the home. 
The giving of presents. 
Fostering the real spirit of Christmas. 
As world geography had been developed through 
the study of child life in various countries, the lan- 
guage topic, “How Christmas is celebrated in America,” 
naturally led to the study of how Christmas is cele- 
brated in other lands. 
The carrying-out of the activity. During the search 
for material in regard to the celebration of Christmas 
in our country, the children had come across many 
references to the Christmas festival in other lands. 
The class discussed which countries it would be most 
interesting to find additional information about. 
They selected Norway and Sweden, Holland, Russia, 
and France. The children chose the country whose 
customs they would like to find out about and present 
to the class. The children choosing the same coun- 
tries formed a group. 
Each group searched the readers and all reference 
books for material in relation to the Christmas festi- 
val of the country they had chosen. The teacher 
contributed additional books, magazines, and news- 
paper articles. Each child was helped to organize 
and present to his group the material he had found by 
the standards and outline developed during the study 
of American customs.
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 HOW TO TEACH READING 
After all material had been collected and given to 
the group the problem arose as to the most interest- 
ing way to present the customs of their country to 
the class. 
Norway and Sweden. The group taking Norway 
and Sweden decided to represent on the sand table 
the Christmas customs of these people. A _ typi- 
cal Norway village nestled among evergreen trees. 
The houses were made to scale and on the roof of 
each was a bunch of wheat for the birds’ Christmas. 
Within the houses could be seen a fire blazing on the 
open hearth lighting up the Christmas tree. Candles 
were burning in all the windows. Over all the village 
and the forest in the background lay a mantle of 
white snow. 
On the closing afternoon one child described the 
things seen on the sand table, another told “ The 
Legend of the Christmas Tree.” The custom of 
going into the woods to get the Christmas trees and to 
bring fresh fir leaves to strew on the floors was de- 
scribed. Another member of the group told about 
the custom of singing Christmas Carols the first thing 
. in the morning. This group ended their part of the 
program with the singing of one of the carols. 
Holland. The group studying Holland decided to 
dramatize the celebration of Christmas among the 
Dutch children. In Act I the children are cleaning 
their shoes and talking about the gifts they want Saint 
Nicholas to bring them. Then they fill the shoes with
-P-A-G-E-289
        ACTIVITIES REQUIRING MUCH READING 279 
hay and a carrot for the Saint’s horse and place them 
by the chimney. As they do this they sing a song 
to Saint Nicholas asking him to fill their shoes with 
something nice. 
The second act shows Saint Nicholas and his black 
servant placing their presents in the good children’s 
shoes, and whipping rods in the shoes of the bad chil- 
dren. 
The third scene shows the children on St. Nicholas 
Day finding the presents in their shoes and hunting 
for the other gifts that have been hidden in various 
places. 
France. The group choosing France decided to tell 
and read about the French customs. A child in a 
French costume told the story of Picciola. 
Russia. The Russian conception of the spirit of 
Christmas was shown by the dramatization of the 
story of Baboushka. 
Reading opportunities utilized:

A Grocrapuy AcTIVvITY 
Why is Switzerland called the Playground of ae 
and the Work Shop of the Swiss? 
Situation. The children were studying Europe dei 
one child came across the statement that Switzerland 
is called the playground of Europe and the work shop 
of the Swiss. As the class had worked out the prob- 
lem, “‘ Why is California called the playground of 
the United States? ” the statement interested them. 
When it was time to take up the study of Switzerland 
the teacher recalled the statement and the above prob- 
lem became the basis for the study of Switzerland. 
Carrying out the activity. The material in the 
geography text was taken as a reading lesson. (See 
Lesson Plan, page 264.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
282 HOW TO TEACH READING 
In the geography period the problem, “ Why is 
Switzerland called the Playground of Europe and the 
Work Shop of the Swiss? ” was written on the board. 
The teacher asked the children what they learned in 
the reading lesson in the morning that would help 
answer this problem. The following organization 
resulted: 
I. Why is Switzerland called the playground of 
Europe? 
. The wonderful scenery attracts many tourists. 
. Many people go there to enjoy the sports. 
. Many people go in search of health. 
. Tourists are cared for comfortably and reasonably at 
the many hotels. 
. The life of the Swiss people is interesting. 
  II. Why is Switzerland called the work shop of the 
Swiss? 
1. It is necessary for all the people to work. 
2. Many industries are carried on in the homes. 
3. Many people are employed in caring for the tourists. 
4. Manufacturing centers give employment to many. 
Each of the main answers to these questions became 
a problem question which called for much additional 
reading. Other geography texts and reference books 
and supplementary readers were consulted by the 
class as a whole, by small groups, or by individuals. 
In answering the sub-problem, “ What is the scenery 
that attracts tourists and what causes this beautiful 
scenery?’ the location of Switzerland, its surface
-P-A-G-E-293
A GEOGRAPHY ACTIVITY 283 
features, climate, cities, the picturesque homes and 
customs of the people were taken up, not as isolated 
topics, but in their vital relationship to the main    
    
                            
    
                                                     question. 
In answering all of the main sub-problems under 
“Why is Switzerland called the playground of 
Europe?” other relationships were seen between 
climate, location, surface features, products, and 
industries. 
In dealing with the second part of the problem, 
“Why is Switzerland called the work shop of the 
Swiss? ” surface features, location, climate, were all 
seen as causes for the various occupations and the 
character of the Swiss people. The important cities, 
rivers, lakes, and their location which had already been 
taken up in answering the problem, “‘ Why is Switzer- 
land called the playground of Europe? ” were again 
taken up in relation to the industries of the people. 
When the study was nearly completed the children 
wished to invite their parents in for “An Afternoon 
in Switzerland.” This necessitated a report of the 
work already taken up. Groups became responsible for 
certain portions of the entertainment. Some worked 
on sand table representations of different phases of 
the life of the people, and the sports. Others mounted 
the pictures of Switzerland that had been collected. 
One child drew a picture of the Castle of Chillon. 
On one table the children gathered many articles from 
Switzerland, such as hand-made lace, watches, silks,  
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 HOW TO TEACH READING 
carved wood and ivory, toys, sweet chocolate, con- 
densed milk, and cheese. 
The story of William Tell and stories about moun- 
tain climbing and the St. Bernard dogs were told on 
the last afternoon. At the close of the program the 
children sang the National Song of Switzerland. 
Reading opportunities utilized: 
1. Many reading periods were spent on the reading of 
geographical material relating to the problem. 
2. Reports of articles read at home or in the between- 
recitation period were given. 
8. Sometimes a period was spent in reading interesting 
items found by individuals or by groups. 
4. Much supplementary reading had to be done in 
answering the sub-problems. 
5. When the children came to make sand table repre- 
sentations, additional reading was found necessary. 
6. Stories and poems in relation to the history of Switzer- 
land were read. 
7. The search for stories of mountain climbing called for 
much magazine reading. 
Books read by the children in relation to this activity: 
Allen, Europe, pp. 239 to 243.

DRAMATIZATION OF THE Lire or Rospert Futon 
Situation. The children had been answering the 
problem in history, ‘‘ Why was the steamboat such 
an important factor in the development of our coun- 
try?” They were held responsible for finding the 
most important answers to this question given in 
their history text and reference books. This called for 
much reading and evaluating of material found. The 
following points were finally selected and arranged 
as the most significant answers to the question: 
I. The steamboat made transportation by water easy, 
safe, and profitable. 
II. It made possible the transportation of produce up the 
rivers as well as down them. 
III. It encouraged settlements in the fertile Middle West. 
IV. The steamboat stimulated industries. 
V. It made trade with foreign countries possible. 
Groups chose one of these main answers to develop. 
This caused much additional reading to be done. 
The material was organized by each group and one 
of their number chosen to give the report before the   
-P-A-G-E-297
  
  LIFE OF FULTON DRAMATIZED 287 
class. This gave opportunity for excellent language 
training. 
Much interest in the inventor of the steamboat had 
been aroused through this study. As this grade was 
responsible for the entertainment to be given at the 
next Parent-Teachers’ Meeting the teacher asked the 
children if they thought the dramatization of the life 
of Robert Fulton would be interesting. While the 
majority felt it would, some thought they must know 
more about Fulton’s life before deciding. 
The working-out of the activity. In the reading 
period the whole class read “Robert Fulton, the 
Inventor of the Steamboat,” in their history text, 
The Makers of America, with this question in mind, 
“What events in the life of Robert Fulton would we 
want for our play?” The silent reading of this 
lesson was checked as “The Fox and the Cock.” 
(See Lesson Plan page 257.) In addition the children 
were encouraged to make use of the following refer- 
ence books: 
Faris, Real Stories from Our History. 
An American Citizenship Course in United States History, 
Book I. 
Beard and Bagley, A First Book in American History. 
Burnham, The Making of our Country.

-P-A-G-E-298
  288 HOW TO TEACH READING 
Much additional material was brought in from the 
home. 
Language opportunities utilized: 
In the language periods the children decided what 
events would be most interesting for the play and 
would best portray the life and works of Fulton. 
They decided the following number of acts and scenes 
were necessary: 
ActI 
The Boyhood of Fulton 
Scene 1 
The making of the model of a fishing boat 
Scene 2 
The making of sky rockets 
Acr IT

Following the division into Acts and Scenes the 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
     LIFE OF FULTON DRAMATIZED 289 
children decided where the different scenes would be 
laid and what characters would be needed in each. 
They also decided in a general way what conversa- 
tion would take place. 
Groups then formed and chose a scene they wished 
to work out. They formulated the conversation for 
the scene chosen and decided what properties would 
be necessary. This required much additional reading 
in order to have the conversation, stage settings, and 
costumes historically correct. 
When the groups were ready each presented its 
contribution to the play in sequence and many 
modifications were suggested by the class to make 
each scene fit into its place in an artistic whole. 
The children were then selected for the characters in 
the final production. 
Much practice in written language was secured in 
the writing of the conversations to be used in the 
different scenes. After these conversations were 
presented to the group they were revised until the 
final form was chosen. Then the entire scene was 
written to present it to the class as a whole. The 
children felt the need of much help in capitalization, 
punctuation, and arrangement. 
Spelling opportunities utilized: 
In anticipating the writing of conversation for the 
various scenes and programs to be given to the visitors 
the children became conscious of their need for know-

Writing opportunities utilized: 
The writing of conversations and the writing of the 
programs motivated the work. Much practice had 
to be given to difficult words and letters. 
Reading opportunities utilized: 
1. The reading of “Robert Fulton, the Inventor of the 
Steamboat.” 
2. The reading of reference books assigned to various 
groups and searching home and library books for addi- 
tional data concerning the life of Robert Fulton. 
8. The searching for information concerning the manners, 
customs, costumes, and stage settings appropriate for 
the play. 
Handwork opportunities utilized: 
The making of some of the properties and costumes 
needed in the play. 
Art opportunities utilized: 
The arrangement of stage settings. 
Color combinations used. 
The selection of appropriate pictures for the scene in 
Benjamin West’s studio.

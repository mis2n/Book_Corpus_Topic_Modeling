‘THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
CHAPTER I 
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 
Amone the thousands of stout-hearted British 
subjects who decided to try their fortune in the 
Western World after the signing of the Peace of 
Paris in 1763 was one Andrew Jackson, a Scotch- 
Trish Presbyterian of the tenant class, sprung from 
a family long resident in or near the quaint town 
of Carrickfergus, on the northern coast of Ire- 
land, close by the newer and more progressive 
city of Belfast. 
With Jackson went his wife and two infant sons, 
a brother-in-law, and two neighbors with their 
families, who thus made up a typical eighteenth- 
century emigrant group. Arrived at Charleston, 
the travelers fitted themselves out for an overland 
journey, awaited a stretch of favorable weather,

and set off for the Waxhaw settlement, one hun- 
dred and eighty miles to the northwest, where 
numbers of their kinsmen and countrymen were 
already established. There the Jacksons were re- 
ceived with open arms by the family of a second 
brother-in-law, who had migrated a few years 
earlier and who now had a comfortable log house 
and a good-sized clearing. 
The settlement lay on the banks of the upper 
Catawba, near the junction of that stream with 
Waxhaw Creek; and as it occupied a fertile oasis 
in a vast waste of pine woods, it was for decades 
largely cut off from touch with the outside world. 
The settlement was situated, too, partly in North 
Carolina and partly in South Carolina, so that in 
the pre-Revolutionary days many of the inhabit- 
ants hardly knew, or cared to know, in which of 
the two provinces they dwelt. 
Upon their arrival Jackson’s friends bought land 
on the creek and within the bounds of the settle- 
ment. Jackson himself was too poor, however, to 
do this, and accordingly took up a claim six miles 
distant on another little stream known as Twelve- 
mile Creek. Here, in the fall of 1765, he built a 
small cabin, and during the winter he cleared five 
or six acres of ground. The next year he was able
-P-A-G-E-8
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN s 
to raise enough corn, vegetables, and pork to keep: 
his little household from want. The tract thus oc-" 
cupied cannot be positively identified, but it lay 
in what is now Union County, North Carolina, a 
few miles from Monroe, the county seat. 
Then came tragedy of a sort in which frontier 
history abounds. In the midst of his efforts to hew 
out a home and a future for those who were dear 
to him the father sickened and died, in March, 
1767, at the early age of twenty-nine, less than 
two years after his arrival at the settlement. Tra- 
dition says that his death was the result of a rup- 
ture suffered in attempting to move a heavy log, 
and that it was so sudden that the distracted wife 
had no opportunity to seek aid from the distant 
neighbors. When at last the news got abroad, 
sympathy and assistance were lavished in true 
frontier fashion. Borne in a rude farm wagon, 
the remains were taken to the Waxhaw burying 
ground and were interred in a spot which tradition, 
but tradition only, is able today to point out. 
The widow never returned to the desolated home- 
stead. She and her little ones were taken into the 
family of one of her married sisters, where she 
spent her few remaining years. On the 15th of 
March, less than two weeks after her husband’s
-P-A-G-E-9
4 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
death, she gave birth to a third son; and the child 
‘was promptly christened Andrew, in memory of 
the parent he would never know. 
Curiously, the seventh President’s birthplace has 
been a matter of sharp controversy. There is a 
tradition that the birth occurred while the mother 
was visiting a neighboring family by the name of 
McKemy; and Parton, one of Jackson’s principal 
biographers, adduces a good deal of evidence in 
support of the story. On the other hand, Jackson 
always believed that he was born in the home of 
the aunt with whom his bereaved mother took up 
her residence; and several biographers, including 
Bassett, the most recent and the best, accept this 
contention. It really matters not at all, save for 
the circumstance that if the one view is correct 
Jackson was born in North Carolina, while if the 
other is correct he was born in South Carolina. 
Both States have persistently claimed the honor. 
In the famous proclamation which he addressed 
to the South Carolina nullifiers in 1832 Jackson 
referred to them as “fellow-citizens of my native 
state”; in his will he spoke of himself as a South 
Carolinian; and in correspondence and conversation 
he repeatedly declared that he was born on South 
Carolina soil. Jackson was far from infallible, even
-P-A-G-E-10
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 5 
in matters closely touching his own career. But 
the preponderance of evidence on the point lies 
decidedly with South Carolina. 
No one, at all events, can deny to the Waxhaw 
settlement an honored place in American history. 
There the father of John C. Calhoun first made 
his home. There the Revolutionary general, An- 
drew Pickens, met and married Rebecea Calhoun. 
There grew up the eminent North Carolinian 
Governor and diplomat, William R. Davie. There 
William H. Crawford lived as a boy. And there 
Jackson dwelt until early manhood. 
For the times, young Andrew was well brought 
up. His mother was a woman of strong character, 
who cherished for her last-born the desire that he 
should become a Presbyterian clergyman. The 
uncle with whom he lived was a serious-minded 
man who by his industry had won means ample for 
the comfortable subsistence of his enlarged house- 
hold. When he was old enough, the boy worked 
for his living, but no harder than the frontier boys 
of that day usually worked; and while his advan- 
tages were only such as a backwoods community 
afforded, they were at least as great as those of 
most boys similarly situated, and they were far 
superior to those of the youthful Lincoln.
-P-A-G-E-11
6 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Jackson’s earlier years, nevertheless, contained 
little promise of his future distinction. He grew 
up amidst a rough people whose tastes ran strongly 
to horse-racing, cockfighting, and heavy drinking, 
and whose ideal of excellence found expression in 
a readiness to fight upon any and all occasions in 
defense of what they considered to be their personal 
honor. In young Andrew Jackson these character- 
istics appeared in a superlative degree. He was 
mischievous, willful, daring, reckless. Hardly an 
escapade took place in the community in which he 
did not share; and his sensitiveness and quick 
temper led him continually into trouble. In his 
early teens he swore like a trooper, chewed tobacco 
incessantly, acquired a taste for strong drink, and 
set a pace for wildness which few of his associates 
could keep up. He was passionately fond of run~ 
ning foot races, leaping the bar, jumping, wrestling, 
and every sort of sport that partook of the charac- 
ter of mimic battle— and he never acknowledged ~ 
defeat. ‘I could throw him three times out of 
four,” testifies an old schoolmate, “but he would. 
never stay throwed. He was dead game even then, 
and never would give up.”” Another early compan- 
ion says that of all the boys he had known Jack- 
son was the only bully who was not also a coward.
-P-A-G-E-12
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 7 
Of education the boy received only such as was 
put unavoidably in his way. It is said that his 
mother taught him to read before he was five years 
old; and he attended several terms in the little low- 
roofed log schoolhouse in the Waxhaw settlement. 
But his formal instruction never took him beyond 
the fundamentals of reading, writing, geography, 
grammar, and “casting accounts.” He was neither 
studious nor teachable. As a boy he preferred 
sport to study, and as a man he chose to rely on his 
own fertile ideas rather than to accept guidance 
from others. He never learned to write the Eng- 
lish language correctly, although he often wrote it 
eloquently and convincingly. In an age of bad 
spellers he achieved distinction from the number 
of ways in which he could spell a word within 
the space of a single page. He could use no 
foreign languages; and of the great body of sci- 
ence, literature, history, and the arts he knew 
next to nothing. He never acquired a taste for 
books, although vanity prompted him to treasure 
throughout his public career all correspondence 
and other documentary materials that might be 
of use to future biographers. Indeed, he picked 
as a biographer first his military aide, John Reid, 
and later his close friend, John H. Eaton, whom
-P-A-G-E-13
8 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
he had the satisfaction in 1829 of appointing Sec- 
retary of War. 
When the Revolution came, young Andrew was 
a boy of ten. For a time the Carolina backwoods 
did not greatly feel the effect of the change. Butin 
the spring of 1780 all of the revolutionary troops 
in South Carolina were captured at Charleston, and 
the lands from the sea to the mountains were left 
at the mercy of Tarleton’s and Rawdon’s bands 
of redcoats and their Tory supporters. Twice the 
Waxhaw settlement was ravaged before the pa- 
triots could make a stand. Young Jackson wit- 
nessed two battles in 1780, without taking part in 
them, and in the following year he, a brother, and 
a cousin were taken prisoners in a skirmish. To 
the day of his death Jackson bore on his head and 
hand the marks of a saber blow administered by a 
British lieutenant whose jack boots he refused to 
polish. When an exchange of prisoners was made, 
Mrs. Jackson secured the release of her two boys, 
but not until after they had contracted smallpox 
in Camden jail. The older one died, but the 
younger, though reduced to a skeleton, survived. 
Already the third brother had given up his life in 
battle; and the crowning disaster came when the 
mother, going as a volunteer to nurse the wounded
-P-A-G-E-14
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 9 
Waxhaw prisoners on the British vessels in Charles- 
ton harbor, fell ill of yellow fever and perished. 
Small wonder that Andrew Jackson always hated 
the British uniform, or that when he sat in the 
executive chair an anti-British feeling colored all 
of his dealings with foreign nations! 
At the age of fourteen, the sandy-haired, pock- 
marked lad of the Waxhaws found himself alone 
in the world. The death of his relatives had made 
him heir to a portion of his grandfather’s estate in 
Carrickfergus; but the property was tied up in the 
hands of an administrator, and the boy was in 
effect both penniless and homeless. The memory 
of his mother and her teachings was, as he was sub-- 
sequently accustomed to say, the only capital with 
which he started life. To a natural waywardness 
and quarrelsomeness had been added a heritage of 
bitter memories, and the outlook was not bright. 
Upon one thing the youth was determined: he 
would no longer be a charge upon his uncle or upon 
any oneelse. What to turn to, however, was not so 
easy to decide. First he tried the saddler’s trade, 
but that was too monotonous. Then he undertook 
school-teaching; that proved little better. Desir- 
ous of a glimpse of the world, he went to Charles- 
ton in the autumn of 1782. There he made the
-P-A-G-E-15
10 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
acquaintance of some people of wealth and fell inte 
habits of life which were beyond his means. At the 
race track he bet and swaggered himself into notice; 
and when he ran into debt he was lucky enough to 
free himself by winning a large wager. But the 
proceeds of his little inheritance, which had in 
the meantime become available, were now entirely 
used up; and when in the spring the young spend- 
thrift went back to the Waxhaws, he had only a 
fine horse with elegant equipment, a costly pair of 
pistols, a gold watch, and a fair wardrobe — in 
addition to some familiarity with the usages of 
fashion — to show for his spent “fortune.” 
One other thing which Jackson may have carried 
back with him from Charleston was an ambition 
to become a lawyer. At all events, in the fall of 
1784 he entered the law office of a certain Spruce 
Macay in the town of Salisbury, North Carolina; 
and, after three years of intermittent study, he 
was admitted to practice in the courts of the State. 
‘The instruction which he had received was not of 
a high order, and all accounts agree that the young 
aman took his tasks lightly and that he learned but 
little law. That he fully sustained the reputation 
which he had gained in the Waxhaws is indicated. 
by testimony of one of Macay’s fellow townsmen,
-P-A-G-E-16
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN i 
after Jackson had become famous, to the effect 
that the former student had been “‘the most roar- 
ing, rollicking, game-cocking, card-playing, mis- 
chievous fellow that ever lived in Salisbury.” 
Upon his admission to the bar the irresponsible 
young blade hung out his shingle in Martinsville, 
Guilford County, North Carolina, and sat down 
to wait for clients. He was still less than twenty 
years old, without influence, and with only such 
friends as his irascible disposition permitted him to 
make and hold. Naturally business came slowly, 
and it became necessary to eke out a living by 
serving as a local constable and also by assisting 
in a mercantile enterprise carried on by two ac- 
quaintances in the town. After a year this hand- 
to-mouth existence began to pall. Neither then 
nor in later life did Jackson have any real taste or 
aptitude for law. He was not of a legal turn of 
mind, and he was wholly unprepared to suffer the 
sacrifices and disappointments which a man of 
different disposition would have been willing to 
undergo in order to win for himself an established 
position in his profession. Chagrin in this restless 
young man was fast yielding to despair when an 
alluring field of action opened for him in the fast- 
developing country beyond the mountains.
-P-A-G-E-17
12 ‘THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
The settlement of white men in that part of 
North Carolina which lay west of the Alleghanies 
had begun a year or two after Jackson’s birth. At 
first the hardy pioneers found lodgment on the 
Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky, and other streams 
to the east of modern Knoxville. But in 1779 a 
colony was planted by James Robertson and John 
Donelson on the banks of the Cumberland, two 
hundred miles farther west, and in a brief time the 
remoter settlement, known as Nashville, became a 
Mecca for homeseeking Carolinians and Virginians. 
The intervening hill and forest country abounded 
in hostile Indians. The settler or trader who un- 
dertook to traverse this region took his life in his 
hands, and the settlements themselves were sub- 
ject to perennial attack. 
In 1788, after the collapse of an attempt of the 
people of the ‘‘ Western District” to set up an in- 
dependent State by the name of Franklin, the 
North Carolina Assembly erected the three coun- 
ties included in the Cumberland settlement into a 
superior court district; and the person selected for 
judge was a close friend of Jackson, John McNairy, 
who also had been a law pupil of Spruce Macay 
in Salisbury. McNairy had been in the Tennessee 
region two years, but at the time of receiving his
-P-A-G-E-18
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 13 
judicial appointment he was visiting friends in 
the Carolinas. His description of the opportunities 
awaiting ambitious young men in the back coun- 
try influenced a half-dozen acquaintances, lawyers 
and others, to make the return trip with him; and 
among the number was Jackson. Some went to 
assume posts which were at McNairy’s disposal, 
but Jackson went only to see the country. 
Assembling at Morganton, on the east side of 
the mountains, in the fall of 1788, the party pro- 
ceeded leisurely to Jonesboro, which, although as 
yet only a village of fifty or sixty log houses, was 
the metropolis of the eastern Tennessee settle- 
ments. There the party was obliged to wait for a 
sufficient band of immigrants to assemble before 
they could be led by an armed guard with some 
degree of safety through the dangerous middle 
country. As a highway had just been opened 
between Jonesboro and Nashville, the travelers 
were able to cover the distance in fifteen days. 
Jackson rode a fine stallion, while a pack mare 
carried his worldly effects, consisting of spare 
clothes, blankets, half a dozen law books, and 
small quantities of ammunition, tea, tobacco, 
liquor, and salt. For defense he bore a rifle and 
three pistols; and in his pocket he carried one
-P-A-G-E-19
144 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
hundred and eighty dollars of the much valued 
hard money. On the second day of November the 
emigrant train made its appearance in Nashville 
bringing news of much interest — in particular, 
that the Federal Constitution had been ratified by 
the ninth State, and that the various legislatures 
were preparing to choose electors, who would un- 
doubtedly make George Washington the first 
President of the Republic. 
Less than ten years old, Nashville had now a 
population of not over two hundred. But it was 
the center of a somewhat settled district extend- 
ing up and down the Cumberland for a distance of 
eighty or ninety miles, and the young visitor from 
the Waxhaws quickly found it a promising field for 
his talents. There was only one lawyer in the 
place, and creditors who had been outbid for his 
services by their debtors were glad to put their 
cases in the hands of the newcomer. It is said that 
before Jackson had been in the settlement a month 
he had issued more than seventy writs to delin- 
quent debtors. When, in 1789, he was appointed 
“solicitor,” or prosecutor, in Judge McNairy’s 
jurisdiction with a salary of forty pounds for each 
court he attended, his fortune seemed made and he 
forthwith gave up all thought of returning to his
-P-A-G-E-20
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 15 
Carolina home. Instead he took lodgings under 
the roof of the widow of John Donelson, and in 
1791 he married a daughter of that doughty fron- 
tiersman. Land was still cheap, and with the pro- 
ceeds of his fees and salary he purchased a large 
plantation called Hunter’s Hill, thirteen miles from 
Nashville, and there he planned to establish a 
home which would take rank as one of the finest 
in the western country. 
The work of a frontier solicitor was diverse and 
arduous. A turbulent society needed to be kept 
in order and the business obligations of a shifty 
and quarrelsome people to be enforced. No great 
knowledge of law was required, but personal fear- 
lessness, vigor, and incorruptibility were indis- 
pensable. Jackson was just the man for the busi- 
ness. His physical courage was equaled by his 
moral strength; he was passionately devoted to 
justice; he was diligent and conscientious; and, as 
one writer has remarked, bad grammar, incorrect 
pronunciation, and violent denunciation did not 
shock the judges of that day or divert the mind 
of juries from the truth. Traveling aimost con- 
stantly over the wretched roads and through the 
dark forests, dodging Indians, swimming his horse 
across torrential streams, sleeping alone in the
-P-A-G-E-21
16 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
woods with hand on rifle, threatened by desperate 
wrongdoers, Andrew Jackson became the best- 
known figure in all western Tennessee and won at 
this time a great measure of that public confidence 
which later became his chief political asset. 
Meanwhile the rapid growth of population south 
of the Ohio River made necessary new arrange- 
ments for purposes of government. In 1790 the 
region between the Ohio and the present States of 
Alabama and Mississippi, having been turned over 
to the Nation by its earlier possessors, was erected 
into the “Southwest Territory,” and in 1791 the 
northern half became the State of Kentucky. In 
1793 the remainder of the Territory set up a Legis- 
lature, and three years later delegates from the 
eleven counties met at Knoxville to draw up a 
new frame of government with a view to admis- 
sion to statehood. Jackson was a member of thiv 
convention, and tradition has it that it was 
he who brought about the selection of the name 
Tennessee, an Indian term meaning ‘‘The Great 
Crooked River,” as against Franklin, Washington, 
and other proposed designations for the new State. 
At all events, upon the admission of the State in 
1796, he was chosen as its sole representative in the 
lower branch of Congress.
-P-A-G-E-22
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 17 
In the late autumn of that year the young law- 
maker set out for the national capital at Philadel- 
phia, and there he arrived, after a journey of almost 
eight hundred miles on horseback, just as the tri- 
umphs of the Democrats in the recent presiden- 
tial election were being duly celebrated. He had 
not been chosen as a party man, but it is altogether 
probable that his own sympathies and those of 
most of his constituents lay with the Jeffersonians; 
and his appearance on the floor of Congress was an 
omen of the fast-rising tide of western democracy 
which should never find its ultimate goal until this 
rough but honest Tennesseean should himself be 
borne into the presidential chair. 
Jackson’s career in Congress was brief and un- 
eventful. After a year of service in the House of 
Representatives he was appointed to fill the un- 
expired term of William Blount in the Senate. 
But this post he resigned in 1798 in order to devote 
his energies to his private affairs. While at Phila- 
delphia he made the acquaintance not only of 
John Adams, Jefferson, Randolph, Gallatin, and 
Burr, but of his future Secretary of State, Edward 
Livingston, and of some other persons who were 
destined to be closely connected with his later 
eareer. But Jackson was not fitted for a legislative
-P-A-G-E-23
18 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
body either by training or by temperament. He is 
recorded as speaking in the House only twice and 
in the Senate not at all, and he seems to have made 
no considerable impression upon his colleagues. 
Gallatin later described him as “a tall, lank, un- 
couth-looking personage, with long locks of hair 
hanging over his face, and a queue down his back 
tied in an eel-skin; his dress singular, his manners 
and deportment those of a rough backwoodsman.”” 
And Jefferson is represented as saying of Jackson 
to Webster at Monticello in 1824: ‘His passions 
are terrible. When I was president of the Senate 
he was Senator, and he could never speak on 
account of the rashness of his feelings. I have 
seen him attempt it repeatedly, and as often choke 
with rage.” 
Return to Tennessee meant, however, only a 
transfer from one branch of the public service 
to another, for the ex-Senator was promptly ap- 
pointed to a judgeship of the state supreme court 
at a salary of six hundred dollars a year. The posi- 
tion he found not uncongenial and he retained it 
for six years. Now, as earlier, Jackson’s ignorance 
of law was somewhat compensated by his common 
sense, courage, and impartiality; and while only 
one of his decisions of this period is extant, Parton
-P-A-G-E-24
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 19 
reports that the tradition of fifty years ago repre- 
sented them as short, untechnical, unlearned, some- 
times ungrammatical, but generally right. The 
daily life of Jackson as a frontier judge was hardly 
less active and exciting than it had been when he 
was a prosecuting attorney. There were long 
and arduous horseback journeys “‘on circuit”; ill- 
tempered persons often threatened, and sometimes 
attempted, to deal roughly with the author of an 
unfavorable decision; occasionally it was necessary 
to lay aside his dignity long enough to lend a hand 
in capturing or controlling a desperate character. 
For example, on arriving once in a settlement 
Jackson found that a powerful blacksmith had 
committed a crime and that the sheriff dared not 
arrest him. ‘Summon me,” said the judge; where- 
upon he walked down from the bench, found the 
culprit, led him into court, and sentenced him. 
In 1804 Jackson resigned his judgeship in order 
to give exclusive attention again to his private 
affairs. He had fallen badly into debt, and his 
creditors were pressing him hard. One expedient 
after another failed, and finally Hunter’s Hill had 
tobe given up. He saved enough from the wreck, 
however, to purchase a small plantation eight miles 
from Nashville; and there, after several years of
-P-A-G-E-25
20 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
financial rehabilitation, he erected the handsome 
brick house which the country came subsequently 
to know as “The Hermitage.” In partnership with 
two of his wife’s relatives, Jackson had opened a 
store in which, even while still a member of the high- 
est tribunal of the State, he not infrequently passed 
tea and salt and calico over the counter to his neigh- 
bors. In small trading, however, he was not adept, 
and the store failed. Nevertheless, from 1804 until 
1813 he successfully combined with planting and 
thestock-raising business enterprises of alarger sort, 
especially slave and horse dealing. His debts paid 
off, he now became one of the most prosperous, as 
he already was one of the most influential, men of 
the Cumberland country. 
But it was not given to Andrew Jackson to be a 
mere money-maker or to dwell in quietness. In 
1804 he was denied the governorship of the New 
Orleans Territory because he was described to 
Jefferson as “‘a man of violent passions, arbitrary 
in his disposition, and frequently engaged in broils 
and disputes.” During the next decade he fully 
lived up to this description. He quarreled with 
Governor John Sevier, and only the intervention 
of friends prevented the two from doing each other 
violence.’ He broke off friendly relations with his
-P-A-G-E-26
JACKSON THE FRONTIERSMAN 21 
old patron, Judge McNairy. In a duel he killed 
Charles Dickinson, who had spoken disparagingly 
of Mrs. Jackson, and he himself suffered a wound 
which weakened him for life. He publicly caned 
one Thomas Swann. In a rough-and-tumble en- 
counter with Thomas Hart Benton and the Iat- 
ter’s brother Jesse he was shot in the shoulder and 
one of his antagonists was stabbed. This list of 
quarrels, threats, fights, and other violent out- 
bursts could be extended to an amazing length. 
“Yes, I had a fight with Jackson,’ Senator Benton 
admitted late in life; “‘a fellow was hardly in the 
fashion then who hadn’t.” 
At the age of forty-five Jackson had not yet 
found himself. He was known in his own State as 
“a successful planter, a breeder and racer of horses, 
a swearer of mighty oaths, a faithful and generous 
man to his friends, a chivalrous man to women, 
a hospitable man at his home, a desperate and re- 
lentless man in personal conflicts, a man who 
always did the things he set himself to do.” But 
he had achieved no nation-wide distinction; he had 
not wrought out a career; he had made almost as 
many enemies as friends; he had cut himself off 
from official connections; he had no desire to return 
to the legal profession; and he was so dissatisfied
-P-A-G-E-27
22 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
with his lot and outlook that he: seriously con- 
sidered moving to Mississippi in order to make a 
fresh start. 
One thread, however, still bound him to the pub- 
lic service. From 1802 he had been major general 
of militia in the eleven counties of western Ten- 
nessee; and notwithstanding the fact that three 
ealls from the Government during a decade had 
yielded no real opportunity for action, he clung 
both to the office and to the hope for a chance to 
lead his “hardy sons of the West” against a foe 
worthy of their efforts. This chance came sooner 
than people expected, and it led in precisely the 
direction that Jackson would have chosen — to- 
ward the turbulent, misgoverned Spanish depend- 
ency of Florida.

CHAPTER II 
THE CREEK WAR AND THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS 
Every schoolboy knows and loves the story of the 
midnight ride of Paul Revere. But hardly any- 
body has heard of the twenty-day, fifteen-hun- 
dred-mile ride of “Billy” Phillips, the President’s 
express courier, who in 1812 carried to the South- 
west the news that the people of the United States 
had entered upon a second war with their British 
kinsmen. William Phillips was a young, lithe Ten- 
nesseean whom Senator Campbell took to Wash- 
ington in 1811 as secretary. When not more than 
sixteen years old he had enjoyed the honor of riding 
Andrew Jackson’s famous steed, Truxton, in a heat 
race, for the largest purse ever heard of west of 
the mountains, with the proud owner on one side of 
the stakes. In Washington he occasionally turned 
an honest penny by jockey-riding in the races on 
the old track of Bladensburg, and eventually he 
became one of a squad of ten or twelve expert 
2s
-P-A-G-E-29
24 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
horsemen employed by the Government in carry- 
ing urgent long-distance messages. 
After much hesitation, Congress passed a joint 
resolution at about five o’clock on Friday, June 18, 
1812, declaring war against Great Britain. Be- 
fore sundown the express couriers were dashing 
swiftly on their several courses, some toward re- 
luctant New England, some toward Pennsylvania 
and New York, some southward, some westward. 
To Phillips it fell to carry the momentous news 
to his own Tennessee country and thence down 
the Mississippi to New Orleans. That the task 
was undertaken with all due energy is sufficiently 
attested in a letter written by a Baptist clergy- 
man at Lexington, North Carolina, to a friend, 
who happened to have been one of Jackson’s old 
teachers at the Waxhaws. “I have to inform you,’ 
runs the communication, “that just now the Presi- 
dent’s express-rider, Bill Phillips, has tore through 
this little place without stopping. He came and 
went in a cloud of dust, his horse’s tail and his own 
long hair streaming alike in the wind as they flew 
by. But as he passed the tavern stand where some 
were gathered he swung his leather wallet by its 
straps above his head and shouted — ‘Here’s 
the Stuff! Wake up! War! War with England!!
-P-A-G-E-30
THE CREEK WAR 25 
War!!!’ Then he disappeared in a cloud of dust 
down the Salisbury Road like a streak of Greased 
Lightnin’.” Nine days brought the indefatiga- 
ble courier past Hillsboro, Salisbury, Morganton, 
Jonesboro, and Knoxville to Nashville — a daily 
average of ninety-five miles over mountains and 
through uncleared country. In eleven days more 
the President’s dispatches were in the hands of 
Governor Claiborne at New Orleans. 
The joy of the West was unbounded. The fron- 
tiersman was always ready for a fight, and just 
now he especially wanted a fight with England. 
He resented the insults that his country had 
suffered at the hands of the English authorities 
and had little patience with the vacillating policy 
so long pursued by Congress and the Madison Ad- 
ministration. Other grievances came closer home. 
For two years the West had been disturbed by 
Indian wars and intrigues for which the English 
officers and agents in Canada were held largely 
responsible. In 1811 Governor Harrison of In- 
diana Territory defeated the Indians at Tippe- 
canoe. But Tecumseh was even then working 
among the Creeks, Cherokees, and other southern 
tribes with a view to a confederation which should 
be powerful enough to put a stop to the sale of
-P-A-G-E-31
26 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
land to the advancing white population. A re- 
newal of the disorders was therefore momentarily 
expected. Furthermore, the people of the South- 
west were as usual on bad terms with their Spanish 
neighbors in Florida and Texas; they coveted an 
opportunity for vengeance for wrongs which they 
had suffered; and some longed for the conquest of 
Spanish territory. At all events, war with England 
was the more welcome because Spain, as an ally 
of that power, was likely to be involved. 
Nowhere was the news received with greater 
enthusiasm than at Nashville; and by no one with 
more satisfaction than by Andrew Jackson. As 
major general of militia Jackson had for ten years 
awaited just such a chance for action. In 1811 
he wrote fervently to Harrison offering to come to 
his assistance in the Wabash expedition with five 
hundred West Tennesseeans, but his services were 
not needed. At the close of the year he induced the 
Governor of his State, William Blount, ‘to inform 
the War Department that he could have twenty- 
five hundred men “before Quebec within ninety 
days”’ if desired. Again he wasrefused. But now 
his opportunity hadcome. Billy Phillips was hardly 
on his way to Natchez before Jackson, Blount, and 
Benton were addressing a mass meeting called to
-P-A-G-E-32
THE CREEK WAR Q7 
“ratify”? the declaration of war, and on the fol- 
lowing day a courier started for Washington with 
a letter from Jackson tendering the services of 
-twenty-five hundred Tennesseeans and assuring 
the President, with better patriotism than syn- 
tax, that wherever it might please him to find 
a place of duty for these men he could depend 
upon them to stay “till they or the last armed 
foe expires.” 
After some delay the offer was accepted. Al- 
ready the fiery major general was dreaming of a 
conquest of Florida. “You burn with anxiety,” 
ran a proclamation issued to his division in mid- 
summer, “‘to learn on what theater your arms will 
find employment. Then turn your eyes to the 
South! Behold in the province of West Florida a 
territory whose rivers and harbors are indispen- 
sable to the prosperity of the western, and still 
more so, to the eastern division of our state... . 
It is here that an employment adapted to your 
situation awaits your courage and your zeal, and 
while extending in this quarter the boundaries of 
the Republic to the Gulf of Mexico, you will ex- 
perience a peculiar satisfaction in having conferred 
a signal benefit on that section of the Union to 
which you yourselves immediately belong.”
-P-A-G-E-33
28 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
It lay in the cards that Jackson was to be a 
principal agent in wresting the Florida country 
from the Spaniards; and while there was at Wash- 
ington no intention of allowing him to set off post- 
haste upon the mission, all of the services which he 
was called upon to render during the war con- 
verged directly upon that objective. After what 
seemed an interminable period of waiting came the 
first order to move. Fifteen hundred Tennessee 
troops were to go to New Orleans, ostensibly to 
protect the city against a possible British attack, 
but mainly to be quickly available in case an in- 
vasion of West Florida should be decided upon; 
and Jackson, freshly commissioned major general 
of volunteers, was to lead the expedition. 
The rendezvous was fixed at Nashville for early 
December; and when more than two thousand men, 
representing almost every family of influence in 
the western half of the State, presented themselves, 
Governor Blount authorized the whole number to 
be mustered. On the 7th of January the hastily 
equipped detachment started, fourteen hundred 
infantrymen going down the ice-clogged Cumber- 
land in flatboats and six hundred and seventy 
mounted riflemen proceeding by land. The Gover- 
nor sent a letter carrying his blessing. Jackson
-P-A-G-E-34
THE CREEK WAR 29 
responded with an effusive note in which he ex- 
pressed the hope that “the God of battles may be 
with us.” Parton says with truth that the heart 
of western Tennessee went down the river with the 
expedition. In a letter to the Secretary of War 
Jackson declared that his men had no “‘constitu- 
tional scruples,” but would, if so ordered, plant the 
American eagle on the ‘walls’? of Mobile, Pensa- 
cola, and St. Augustine. 
After five weeks the troops, in high spirits, re- 
assembled at Natchez. Then came cruel disap- 
pointment. From New Orleans Governor James 
Wilkinson, doubtless moved by hatred of Jack- 
son quite as much as by considerations of public 
policy, ordered the little army to stay where it 
was. And on the 15th of March there was placed 
in the commander’s hands a curt note from the 
Secretary of War saying that the reasons for the 
undertaking had disappeared, and announcing that 
the corps under the Tennesseean’s command had 
“ceased to exist.” 
Jackson flew into a rage — and with more reason 
than on certain other occasions. He was sure that 
there was treachery somewhere; at the least, it 
was all a trick to bring a couple of thousand 
good Tennessee volunteers within the clutches of
-P-A-G-E-35
30 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Wilkinson’s recruiting officers. He managed to 
write to the President a temperate letter of protest; 
but to Governor Blount and to the troops he un- 
bosomed himself with characteristic forcefulness of 
speech. There was nothing to do but return home. 
But the irate commander determined to do it in a 
manner to impress the country. He kept his force 
intact, drew rations from the commissary depart- 
ment at Natchez, and marched back to Nashville 
with all the éclat that would have attended a re- 
turning conqueror. When Wilkinson’s subordi- 
nates refused to pay the cost of transporting the 
sick, Jackson pledged his own credit forthe purpose, 
to the amount of twelve thousand dollars. It was 
on the trying return march that his riflemen con- 
ferred on him the happy nickname “Old Hickory.” 
The Secretary of War later sought to appease the 
irascible major general by offering a wholly plau- 
sible explanation of the sudden reversal of the 
Government’s policy; and the expenses of the 
troops on the return march were fully met out of 
the national treasury. But Jackson drew from the 
experience only gall and wormwood. About the 
time when the men reached Natchez, Congress 
definitely authorized the President to take posses- 
sion of Mobile and that part of Florida west of the
-P-A-G-E-36
THE CREEK WAR 31 
Perdido River; and, back once more in the hum- 
drum life of Nashville, the disappointed officer 
could only sit idly by while his pet project was 
successfully carried out by General Wilkinson, the 
man whom, perhaps above all others, he loathed. 
But other work was preparing; and, after all, most 
of Florida was yet to be won. 
In the late summer of 1813 the western country 
was startled by news of a sudden attack of a band 
of upwards of a thousand Creeks on Fort Mims, 
Alabama, culminating in a massacre in which two 
hundred and fifty white men, women, and children 
lost their lives. It was the most bloody occurrence 
of the kind in several decades, and it brought in- 
stantly to a head a situation which Jackson, in 
common with many other military men, had long 
viewed with apprehension. 
From time immemorial the broad stretches of 
hill and valley land southwards from the winding 
Tennessee to the Gulf were occupied, or used as 
hunting grounds, by the warlike tribes forming the 
loose-knit Creek Confederacy. Much of this land 
was extremely fertile, and most of it required little 
labor to prepare it for cultivation. Consequently 
after 1800 the influx of white settlers, mainly cot- 
ton raisers, was heavy; and by 1812 the great
-P-A-G-E-37
32 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
triangular area between the Alabama and the Tom- 
bigbee, as well as extensive tracts along the upper 
Tombigbee and the Mobile, was quite fully occu- 
pied. The heart of the Creek country was the re- 
gion about the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, which 
join in central Alabama to form the stream which 
bears the State’s name. But not even this dis- 
trict was immune from encroachment. 
The Creeks were not of a sort to submit to the 
loss of their Jands without a struggle. Though 
Tecumseh, in 1811, had brought them to the point 
of an uprising, his plans were not carried out, and it 
remained for the news of hostilities between the 
United States and Great Britain to rouse the war 
spirit afresh. In a short time the entire Creek 
country was aflame. Arms and ammunition the 
Indians obtained from the Spaniards across the 
Florida border, and Colonel Edward Nicholls, 
now stationed at Pensacola as provisional British 
Governor, gave them open encouragement. The 
danger was understood not only among the people 
of the Southwest but in Washington. Before plans 
of defense could be carried into effect, however, 
the war broke out, and the wretched people who 
had crowded into the flimsy stockade called by 
rourtesy Fort Mims were massacred. ‘
-P-A-G-E-38
THE CREEK WAR 35 
Hardly had the heap of ruins, ghastly with hu- 
man bodies, ceased to smolder before fleet riders 
were spreading the news in Georgia, in Louisiana, 
and in Tennessee. A shudder swept the country. 
Every exposed community expected to be at- 
tacked next. The people’s demand for vengeance 
was overmastering, and from north, west, and 
east volunteer armies were soon on the march. 
Tennessee sent two quotas, one from the eastern 
counties under General John Cocke, the other 
from the western under Andrew Jackson. When 
the news of the disaster on the Mobile reached 
Nashville, Jackson was lying helpless from wounds 
received in his fight with the Bentons. But he 
issued the necessary orders from his bed and let it 
be known with customary vigor that he, the senior 
major general, and no one else, would lead the 
expedition; and though three weeks later he started 
off with his arm tightly bandaged to his side and a 
shoulder so sore that it could not bear the pressure 
of an epaulette, lead the expedition he did. 
About the middle of October the emaciated but, 
dogged commander brought his forces together, 
2700 strong, at Huntsville and began cutting his 
way across the mountains toward the principal 
Creek settlements. His plan was to fall suddenly
-P-A-G-E-39
34 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
upon these settlements, strike terror into the in- 
habitants, and force a peace on terms that would 
guarantee the safety of the frontier populations. 
Supplies were slow to arrive, and Jackson fumed 
and stormed. He quarreled desperately, too, with 
Cocke, whom he unjustly blamed for mismanage- 
ment. But at last he was able to emerge on the 
banks of the Coosa and build a stockade, Fort 
Strother, to serve as a base for the campaign. 
During the months that followed, the intrepid 
leader was compelled to fight two foes — his 
insubordinate militiamen and the Creeks. His 
command consisted partly of militia and partly of 
volunteers, including many men who had first 
enlisted for the expedition down the Mississippi. 
Starvation and disease caused loud murmurings, 
and after one or two minor victories had been won 
the militiamen took it into their heads to go back 
home. Jackson drew up the volunteers across the 
mutineers’ path and drove them back to the camp. 
Then the volunteers started off, and the militia had 
to be used to bring them back! At one time the 
furious general faced a mutinous band single- 
handed and, swearing that he would shoot the first 
man who stirred, awed the recalcitrants into obe- 
dience. On another occasion he had a youth who
-P-A-G-E-40
THE CREEK WAR 35 
had been guilty of insubordination shot before the 
whole army as an object lesson. At last it became 
apparent that nothing could be done with such 
troops, and the volunteers — such of them as had 
not already slipped away — were allowed to go 
home. Governor Blount advised that the whole 
undertaking be given up. But Jackson wrote him 
a letter that brought a flush of shame to his cheek, 
and in a short time fresh forces by the hundreds, 
with ample supplies, were on the way to Fort 
Strother. Among the newcomers was a lank, angu- 
lar-featured frontiersman who answered to the 
name of Sam Houston. 
After having been reduced for a short period to 
one hundred men, Jackson by early spring had an 
army of five thousand, including a regiment of 
regulars, and found it once more possible to act. 
The enemy decided to make its stand at a spot 
called by the Indians Tohopeka, by the whites 
Horseshoe Bend, on the Tallapoosa. Here a thou- 
sand warriors, with many women and children, 
took refuge behind breastworks which they be- 
lieved impregnable, and here, in late March, Jack- 
son attacked with a force of three thousand men. 
No quarter was asked and none given, on either 
side, and the battle quickly became a butchery.
-P-A-G-E-41
36 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Driven by fire from a thicket of dry brush in which 
they took refuge, the Creek warriors were shot 
down or bayoneted by the hundreds; those who 
plunged into the river for safety were killed as they 
swam. Scarcely a hundred survived. Among the 
number was a youth who could speak a little Eng- 
lish, and whose broken leg one of the surgeons 
undertook to treat. Three stalwart riflemen were 
required to hold the patient. “Lie still, my boy, 
they will save your life,” said Jackson encourag- 
ingly, as he came upon the scene. ‘No good,’’ 
replied the disconsolate victim. “No good. Cure 
um now, kill um again!” 
The victory practically ended the war. Many of 
the “‘Red Sticks,” as the Creek braves were called, 
fled beyond the Florida border; but many — 
among them the astute half-breed Weathersford, 
who had ordered the assault on Fort Mims — 
came in and surrendered. Fort Jackson, built in 
the river fork, became an outpost of American 
sovereignty in the very heart of the Creek district. 
“The fiends of the Tallapoosa,” declared the vic- 
torious commander in his farewell address to his 
men, “will no longer murder our women and chil- 
dren, or disturb the quiet of our borders.” 
Jackson returned to Tennessee to find himself
-P-A-G-E-42
THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS = 37 
the most popular man in the State. Nashville 
gave him the first of what was destined to be a 
long series of tumultuous receptions; and within 
a month the news came that William Henry Har- 
rison had resigned his commission and that Jack- 
3on had been appointed a major general in the 
army of the United States, with command in the 
southwestern district, including Mobile and New 
Orleans. “Thus did the frontier soldier, who 
eighteen months earlier had not commanded an 
expedition or a detachment, come to occupy the 
highest rank in the army of his country. No other 
man in that country’s service since the Revolution 
fas risen to the top quite so quickly. 
By his appointment Jackson became the even- 
tual successor of General Wilkinson, with head- 
quarters at New Orleans. His first move, however, 
vas to pay a visit to Mobile; and on his way 
thither, in August, 1814, he paused in the Creek 
country to garner the fruits of his late victory. 
A council of the surviving chiefs was assembled 
and a treaty was presented, with a demand that it 
be signed forthwith. The terms took the Indians 
aback, but argument was useless. The whites 
were granted full rights to maintain military posts 297 
1 Bassett, The Life of Andrew Jackson, vol. 1, p. 123.
-P-A-G-E-43
38 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
and roads and to navigate the rivers in the Creek 
lands; the Creeks had to promise to stop trading 
with British and Spanish posts; and they were 
made to cede to the United States all the lands 
which their people had claimed west and southeast 
of the Coosa River — more than half of their an- 
cient territories. Thus was the glory of the Creek 
nation brought to an end. 
Meanwhile the war with Great Britain was en- 
tering a new and threatening phase. No notable 
successes had been achieved on land, and repeated 
attempts to reduce Canada had signally failed. 
On the Great Lakes and the high seas the navy had 
won glory, but only a handful of privateers was left 
to keep up the fight. The collapse of Napoleon’s 
power had brought a lull in Europe, and the British 
were free to concentrate their energies as never 
before on the conflict in America. The effects 
were promptly seen in the campaign which led to 
the capture of Washington and the burning of the 
Federal Capitol in August, 1814. They were 
equally manifest in a well-laid plan for a great 
assault on the country’s southern borders and on 
the great Mississippi Valley beyond. 
The Jast-mentioned project meant that, after 
two years of immunity, the Southwest had become
-P-A-G-E-44
THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS 39 
a main theater of the war. There was plenty of 
warning of what was coming, for the British squad- 
ron intended for the attack began assembling in 
the West Indies before the close of summer. No 
one knew, however, where or when the blow would 
fall. To Jackson the first necessity seemed to be 
to make sure of the defenses of Mobile. For a time, 
at all events, he believed that the attack would be 
made there, rather than at New Orleans; and an 
attempt of a British naval force in September to 
destroy Fort Bowyer, at the entrance to Mobile 
Bay, confirmed his opinion. 
But the chief attraction of Mobile for the 
General was its proximity to Florida. In July 
he had written to Washington asking permission 
to occupy Pensacola. Months passed without a 
reply. Temptation to action grew; and when, in 
October, three thousand Tennessee troops arrived 
under one of the subordinate officers in the recent 
Creek War, longer hesitation seemed a sign of 
weakness. Jackson therefore led his forces against 
the Spanish stronghold, now in British hands, and 
quickly forced its surrender. His men blew up one 
of the two forts, and the British blew up the other. 
Within a week the work was done and the General, 
well pleased with his exploit, was back at Mobile.
-P-A-G-E-45
40 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
There he found awaiting him, in reply to his July 
letter, an order from the new Secretary of War, 
James Monroe, forbidding him to touch Pensacola. 
No great harm was done, for the invaded territory 
was no longer neutral soil, and the task of soothing 
the ruffled feelings of the Spanish court did not 
prove difficult. 
As the autumn wore on, signs multiplied that the 
first British objective in the South was to be New 
Orleans, and no efforts were spared by the authori- 
ties at Washington to arouse the Southwest to its 
danger and to stimulate an outpouring of troops 
sufficient to repel any force that might be landed 
at the mouth of the Mississippi. On the 21st 
of November, Jackson set out for the menaced 
city. Five days later a fleet of fifty vessels, carry- 
ing ten thousand veteran British troops under com- 
mand of Generals Pakenham and Gibbs, started 
from Jamaica for what was expected to be an easy 
conquest. On the 10th of December the hostile 
armada, cast anchor off the Louisiana coast. Two 
weeks later some two thousand redcoats emerged 
from Lake Borgne, within six or seven miles of 
New Orleans, when the approach to the city on 
that side was as yet unguarded by.a gun or a 
man or an entrenchment.
-P-A-G-E-46
THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS 41 
That the “impossible” was now accomplished 
was due mainly to Jackson, although credit must 
not be withheld from a dozen energetic subor- 
dinate officers nor from the thousands of patri- 
ots who made up the rank and file of the hastily 
gathered forces of defense. Men from Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee — 
all contributed to one of the most remarkable 
military achievements in our history; although 
when the fight was over it was found that hun- 
dreds were still as unarmed as when they arrived 
upon the scene. 
A preliminary clash, in a dense fog, on the second 
evening before Christmas served to inspire each 
army with a wholesome respect for the other. The 
British decided to postpone further action until 
their entire force could be brought up, and this 
gave Jackson just the time he needed to assemble 
his own scattered divisions, select lines of defense, 
and throw up breastworks. By the end of the first 
week of January both sides were ready for the test. 
The British army was a splendid body of seven 
thousand trained soldiers, seamen, and marines. 
There were regiments which had helped Wellington to 
win Talavera, Salamanca, and Victoria, and within a
-P-A-G-E-47
42 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
few short months some of these same regiments were to 
stand in that thin red line which Ney and Napoleon’s 
guard could never break. Their general, Pakenham, 
Wellington’s brother-in-law, was a distinguished pupil 
of his illustrious kinsman. Could frontiersmen who had 
never fought together before, who had never seen the 
face of a civilized foe, withstand the conquerors of Napo- 
leon? But two branches of the same stubborn race were 
represented on that little watery plain. The soldiers 
trained to serve the strongest will in the Old World 
were face to face with the rough and ready yeomanry 
embattled for defense by the one man of the new 
world whose soul had most iron in it. It was Sala- 
manca against Tohopeka, discipline against individ- 
ual alertness, the Briton of the little Isle against the 
Briton of the wastes and wilds. But there was one 
great difference. Wellington, “the Iron Duke,” was 
not there; “Old Hickory” was everywhere along the 
American lines.* 
Behind their battery-studded parapets the 
Americans waited for the British to make an as- 
sault. This the invaders did, five thousand strong, 
on January 8, 1815. The fighting was hard, but 
the main attack failed at every point. Three Brit- 
ish major generals, including Pakenham, were 
killed early in the action, and the total British loss 
exceeded two thousand. The American loss was 
tBrown, Andrew Jackson, pp. 75~76,
-P-A-G-E-48
THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS = 43 
but seventy-one. The shattered foe fell back, lay 
inactive for ten days, and then quietly withdrew 
as they had come. Though Jackson was not noted 
for piety, he always believed that his success on 
this occasion was the work of Providence. ‘“‘Heav- 
en, to be sure,’’ he wrote to Monroe, “has inter- 
posed most wonderfully in our behalf, and I am 
filled with gratitude when I look back to what we 
have escaped.” 
By curious irony, the victory had no bearing 
upon the formal results of the war. A treaty of 
peace had been signed at Ghent two weeks before, 
and the news of the pacification and of the exploit 
at New Orleans reached the distracted President at 
almost the same time. But who shall say that the 
battle was not one of the most momentous in 
American history? It compensated for a score of 
humiliations suffered by the country in the pre- 
ceding years. It revived the people’s drooping 
pride and put new energy into the nation’s deal- 
ings with its rivals, contributing more than any 
other single event to make this war indeed a 
“second war of independence.” “Now,” de- 
clared Henry Clay when the news reached him 
in Paris, “I can go to England without morti- 
fication.” Finally, the battle brought Andrew
-P-A-G-E-49

Jackson into his own as the idol and incarna- 
tion of the West, and set the western democracy 
decisively forward as a force to be reckoned with 
in national affairs,
-P-A-G-E-50
CHAPTER If 
THE “CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 
Tue victory at New Orleans made Jackson not 
only the most popular man in the United States 
but a figure of international interest. ‘Napoleon, 
returning from Elba to eke out the Hundred Days 
and add the name Waterloo to history, paused now 
and then a moment to study Jackson at New 
Orleans. The Duke of Wellington, chosen by 
assembled Europe to meet the crisis, could find 
time even at Brussels to call for ‘all available 
information on the abortive expedition against 
Louisiana.’”* 
While his countrymen were sounding his praises, 
the General, however, fell into a controversy with 
the authorities and people of New Orleans which 
lent a drab aspect to the closing scene of an other- 
wise brilliant drama. One of his first acts upon 
arriving in the defenseless city had been to declare 
*Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, vol, 1, pp. 94-95.

martial law; and under the decree the daily life of 
the inhabitants had been rigorously circumscribed, 
citizens had been pressed into military service, men 
under suspicion had been locked up, and large 
quantities of cotton and other supplies had been 
seized for the soldiers’ use. When Pakenham’s 
army was defeated, people expected an immediate 
return to normal conditions. Jackson, however, 
proposed to take no chances. Neither the sailing 
of the British fleet nor the receipt of the news of 
peace from Admiral Cochrane influenced him to 
relax his vigilance, and only after official instruc- 
tions came from Washington in the middle of 
March was the ban lifted. 
Meanwhile a violent quarrel had broken out be- 
tween the commander and the civil authorities, 
who naturally wished to resume their accustomed 
functions. Finding that the Creoles were system- 
atically evading service by registering as French 
citizens, Jackson abruptly ordered all such people 
from the city; and he was responsible for numerous 
other arbitrary acts. Protests were lodged, and 
some people threatened judicial proceedings. But 
they might have saved their breath. Jackson was 
not the man to argue matters of the kind. A lead- 
ing Creole who published an especially pointed
-P-A-G-E-52
THE “ CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 47 
protest was clapped into prison, and when the 
Federal district judge, Hall, issued a writ of habeas 
corpus in his behalf, Jackson had him also shut up. 
As soon as he was liberated, the irate judge 
summoned Jackson into court to show why he 
should not be held in contempt. Beyond a blanket 
vindication of his acts, the General would not 
plead. “TI will not answer interrogatories,” he 
declared. “I may have erred, but my motives can- 
not be misinterpreted.” The judge thereupon im- 
posed a fine of one thousand dollars, the only ques- 
tion being, he declared, “whether the Law should 
bend to the General or the General to the Law.” 
Jackson accepted the sentence with equanim- 
ity, and to a group of admirers who drew him in a 2 
carriage from the court room to one of the leading 
coffeehouses, he expressed lofty sentiments on the 
obligation of citizens of every rank to obey the 
laws and uphold the courts. Twenty-nine years 
afterwards Congress voted reimbursement to the 
full amount of the fine with interest. 
For three weeks after the arrival of the treaty of 
peace Jackson lingered at New Orleans, haggling 
by day with the contractors and merchants whose 
cotton, blankets, and bacon were yet to be paid 
for, and enjoying in the evening the festivities
-P-A-G-E-53
48 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
planned in his honor by grateful citizens. His 
pleasure in the gala affairs of the time was doubled 
by the presence of his wife, who one day arrived 
quite unexpectedly in the company of some Ten- 
nessee friends. Mrs. Jackson was a typical frontier 
planter’s wife — kind-hearted, sincere, benevolent, 
thrifty, pious, but unlettered and wholly innocent 
of polished manners. In all her forty-eight years 
she had never seen a city more pretentious than 
Nashville. She was, moreover, stout and florid, 
and it may be supposed that in her rustic garb she 
was a somewhat conspicuous figure among the 
fashionable ladies of New Orleans society. 
But the wife of Jackson’s accomplished friend 
and future Secretary of State, Edward Livingston, 
fitted her out with fashionable clothes and tact- 
fully instructed her in the niceties of etiquette, and 
ere long she was able to demean herself, if not with- 
out a betrayal of her unfamiliarity with the en- 
vironment, at all events to the complete satisfac- 
tion of the General. The latter’s devotion to his 
wife was a matter of much comment. ‘Debonair 
as he had been in his association with the Creole 
belles, he never missed an opportunity to demon- 
strate that he considered the short, stout, beaming 
matron at his side the perfection of her sex and far

and away the most charming woman in the world.”* 
“Aunt Rachel,” as she was known throughout 
western Tennessee, lived to see the hero of New 
Orleans elected President, but not to share with 
him the honors of the position. “I have sometimes 
thought,” said Thomas Hart Benton, “that Gen- 
eral Jackson might have been a more equable 
tenant of the White House than he was had she 
been spared to share it with him. At all events, 
she was the only human being on earth who ever 
possessed the power to swerve his mighty will or 
soothe his fierce temper.” 
Shortly before their departure the Jacksons were 
guests of honor at a grand ball at the Academy. 
The upper floor was arranged for dancing and the 
lower for supper, and the entire building was aglow 
with flowers, colored lamps, and transparencies. 
As the evening wore on and the dances of polite 
society had their due turn, the General finally 
avowed that he and his bonny wife would show 
the proud city folk what real dancing was. A 
somewhat cynical observer —a certain Nolte, 
whom Jackson had just forced to his own terms in a 
settlement for war supplies — records his impres- 
sion as follows: ‘After supper we were treated to 
t Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, vol. u, p. 97.

-P-A-G-E-55
50 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
a most delicious pas de deux by the conqueror and 
his spouse. To see these two figures, the General, 
a long haggard man, with limbs like a skeleton, and 
Madame la Générale, a short fat dumpling, bob- 
bing opposite each other like half-drunken Indians, 
to the wild melody of Possum up de Gum Tree, and 
endeavoring to make a spring into the air, was very 
remarkable, and far more edifying a spectacle than 
any European ballet could possibly have fur- 
nished.” But Jackson was only less proud of his 
accomplishments as a dancer than as a fighter, and 
it was the part of discretion for a man of Nolte’s 
critical turn to keep a straight face on this occasion. 
In early April the General and his wife started 
homeward, the latter bearing as a parting gift from 
the women of New Orleans the somewhat gaudy 
set of topaz jewelry which she wears in her most 
familiar portrait. The trip was a continuous ova- 
tion, and at Nashville a series of festivities wound 
up with a banquet attended by the most dis- 
tinguished soldiers and citizens of Tennessee and 
presided over by the Governor of the State. Other 
cities gave dinners, and legislatures voted swords 
and addresses. A period of rest at the Hermit- 
age was interrupted in the autumn of 1815 by a 
horseback trip to Washington which involved a
-P-A-G-E-56
THE “ CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 51 
succession of dinners and receptions. But after a 
few months the much féted soldier was back at 
Nashville, ready, as he said, to “resume the culti- 
vation of that friendly intercourse with my friends 
and neighbors which has heretofore constituted so 
great a portion of my happiness.” 
After Jackson had talked over his actions at 
New Orleans with both the President and the Sec- 
retary of War, he had received, as he says, “a 
chart blank,” approving his “whole proceedings”; 
so he had nothing further to worry about on that 
score. The national army had been reorganized 
on a peace footing, in two divisions, each under 
command of a major general. The northern divi- 
sion fell to Jacob Brown of New York, the hero of 
Lundy’s Lane; the southern fell to Jackson, with 
headquarters at Nashville. 
Jackson was the last man to suppose that war- 
fare in the southern half of the United States was a 
thing of the past. He knew that the late contest 
had left the southern Indians restless and that the 
existing treaties were likely to be repudiated at 
any moment. Florida was still in the hands of the 
Spaniards, and he had never a doubt that some 
day this territory would have to be conquered 
and annexed. Moreover Jackson believed for some
-P-A-G-E-57
52 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
years after 1815, according to General Eaton, that 
Great Britain would again make war on the United 
States, using Florida as a base. At all events, it 
ean have caused the General no surprise — or 
regret — to be called again into active service on 
the Florida border before the close of 1817. 
The hold of the Spaniards upon Florida had 
been so far weakened by the War of 1812 that after 
the restoration of peace they occupied only three 
important points — Pensacola, St. Marks, and St. 
Augustine. The rest of the territory became a 
No Man’s Land, an ideal resort for desperate ad- 
venturers of every race and description. There 
was a considerable Indian population, consisting 
mainly of Seminoles, a tribe belonging to the Creek 
Confederacy, together with other Creeks who had 
fled across the border to escape the vengeance 
of Jackson at Tohopeka. All were bitterly hos- 
tile to the United States. There were Spanish 
freebooters, Irish roustabouts, Scotch free lances, 
and runaway slaves—a nondescript lot, and 
all ready for any undertaking that promised ex- 
citement, revenge, or booty. Furthermore there 
were some British soldiers who had remained 
on their own responsibility after the troops were 
withdrawn. The leading spirit among these was
-P-A-G-E-58
THE “CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 53 
Colonel Edward Nicholls, who had already made 
himself obnoxious to the United States by his 
conduct at Pensacola. 
At the close of the war Nicholls and his men 
built a fort on the Apalachicola, fifteen miles 
from the Gulf, and began again to collect and or- 
ganize fugitive slaves, Indians, and adventurers of 
every sort, whom they employed on raids into the 
territory of the United States and in attacks upon 
its inhabitants. The Creeks were falsely informed 
that in the Treaty of Ghent the United States had 
promised to give up all lands taken from them 
during the late war, and they were thus incited to 
rise in vindication of their alleged rights. What 
Nicholls was aiming at came out when, in com- 
pany with several chieftains, he returned to Eng- 
land to ask for an alliance between the “mother 
country” and his buccaneer state. He met no en- 
couragement, however, and in reply to an Ameri- 
can protest the British Government repudiated his 
acts. His réle was nevertheless promptly taken 
up by a misguided Scotch trader, Alexander Ar- 
buthnot, and the reign of lawlessness continued. 
After all, it was Spain’s business to keep order 
on the frontier; and the United States waited.a 
year and a half for the Madrid Government to give
-P-A-G-E-59
54 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
evidence of intent to do so. But, as nothing but 
vain promises were forthcoming, some American 
troops engaged in building a fort on the Apalachi- 
cola, just north of the boundary line, marched 
down the river in July, 1816, bombarded Nicholls’s 
Negro Fort, blew up its magazine, and practically 
exterminated the negro and Indian garrison. A 
menace to the slave property of southern Georgia 
was thus removed, but the bigger problem re- 
mained. The Seminoles were restive; the refugee 
Creeks kept up their forays across the border; and 
the rich lands acquired by the Treaty of Fort 
Jackson were fast filling with white settlers who 
clamored for protection. Though the Monroe Ad- 
ministration had opened negotiations for the ces- 
sion of the whole Florida country to the United 
States, progress was slow and the outcome doubtful. 
Matters came to a head in the closing weeks of 
1817. General Gaines, who was in command on 
the Florida border, had tried repeatedly to get an 
interview with the principal “‘Red Stick” chieftain, 
but all of his overtures had been repulsed. Finally 
he sent a detachment of soldiers to conduct the 
dignitary and his warriors from their village at 
Fowltown, on the American side of the line, to a 
designated parley ground. In no mood for nego-
-P-A-G-E-60
THE “CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 55 
tiation, the chief ordered his followers to fire on 
the visitors; whereupon the latter seized and de- 
stroyed the village. 
The fight at Fowltown may be regarded as the 
beginning of the Seminole War. General Gaines 
was directed to begin operations against the In- 
dians and to pursue them if necessary into East 
Florida; but before he could carry out his orders, 
Jackson was put in personal command of the forces 
acting against the Indians and was instructed to 
concentrate all of the troops in his department at 
Fort Scott and to obtain from the Governors of 
Georgia and Tennessee such other assistance as he 
should need. 
Jackson received his orders at the Hermitage. 
Governor Blount was absent from Nashville, but 
the eager commander went ahead raising troops on 
his own responsibility. Nothing was so certain to 
whet his appetite for action as the prospect of a 
war in Florida. Not only did his instructions 
authorize him to pursue the enemy, under certain 
conditions, into Spanish territory, but from the 
first he himself conceived of the enterprise as 
decidedly more than a punitive expedition. The 
United States wanted Florida and was at the 
moment trying to induce Spain to give it up.
-P-A-G-E-61
56 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Here was the chance to take it regardless of Spain. 
“Let it be signified to me through any channel 
(say Mr. J. Rhea),” wrote the Major General to 
the President, “that the possession of the Floridas 
would be desirable to the United States, and in 
sixty days it will be accomplished.” 
This “‘Rhea letter” became the innocent source 
of one of the most famous controversies in Ameri- 
can history. Jackson supposed that the communi- 
cation had been promptly delivered to Monroe, 
and that his plan for the conquest of Florida had 
the full, if secret, approval of the Administration. 
Instructions from the Secretary of War, Calhoun, 
seemed susceptible of no other interpretation; be- 
sides, the conqueror subsequently maintained that 
he received through Rhea the assurance that he 
coveted. Monroe, however, later denied flatly 
that he had given any orders of the kind. Indeed 
he said that through a peculiar combination of cir- 
cumstances he had not even read Jackson’s letter 
until long after the Florida campaign was ended. 
Each man, no doubt, thought he was telling the 
truth, and historians will probably always differ 
upon the merits of the case. The one thing that is 
perfectly certain is that Jackson, when he carried 
his troops into Florida in 1818, believed that the
-P-A-G-E-62
THE “ CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 57 
Government expected him to prepare the territory 
for permanent American occupation. 
In early March, Jackson was at Fort Scott, on 
the Georgia frontier, with about two thousand 
men. Though he expected other forces, Jackson 
found that scarcity of rations made it inadvisable 
to wait for them, and he therefore marched his 
army on as rapidly as possible down the soggy 
bank of the Apalachicola, past the ruins of Negro 
Fort, into Florida, where he found in readiness 
the provisions which had been sent forward by 
way of Mobile. Turning eastward, Jackson bore 
down upon the Spanish settlement of St. Marks, 
where it was rumored that the hostile riatives had 
assembled in considerable numbers. A small fleet 
of gunboats from Mobile and New Orleans was 
ordered to move along the coast and intercept any 
fugitives, “white, red, or black.” Upwards of 
two thousand friendly Indians joined the land ex- 
pedition, and the invasion became from a mili- 
tary standpoint a sheer farce. The Seminoles were 
utterly unprepared for war, and their villages were 
taken possession of, one by one, without opposi- 
tion. At St. Marks the Indians fled precipitately, 
and the little Spanish garrison, after a glimpse of 
the investing force, asked only that receipts be
-P-A-G-E-63
58 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
given for the movable property confiscated. The 
Seminole War was over almost before it was begun. 
But Jackson was not in Florida simply to quell 
the Seminoles. He was there to vindicate the 
honor and establish the sovereignty of the United 
States. Hence there was further work fo: 
do. The British instigators of lawlessness

thoroughness. At St. Marks he mad:

From the Governor, Don José Callava na 
came a dignified note of protest; but th. 
only reply was an announcement of his purpuse +

THE “CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 59 
population had encouraged the Indians and given 
them supplies. On May 24, 1818, the American 
forces and their allies marched in, unopposed, and 
the commander coolly apprised Callava that he 
would “assume the government until the transac- 
tion can be amicably adjusted by the two govern- 
ments.” “If, contrary to my hopes,” responded 
the Spanish dignitary, ‘Your Excellency should 
persist in your intention to occupy this fortress, 
which I am resolved to defend to the last extremity, 
I shall repel force by force; and he who resists 
aggression can never be considered an aggressor. 
God preserve Your Excellency many years.” To 
which Jackson replied that “resistance would be 
a wanton sacrifice of blood,” and that he could 
not but remark on the Governor’s inconsistency 
in presuming himself capable of repelling an army 
which had conquered Indian tribes admittedly too 
powerful for the Spaniards to control. 
When the Americans approached the fort in 
which Callava had taken refuge, they were received 
with a volley which they answered, as Jackson 
tells us, with “a nine-pound piece and five eight- 
inch howitzers.”” The Spaniards, whose only pur- 
_ pose was to make a decent show of defending the 
' place, then ran up the white flag and were allowed
-P-A-G-E-65
60 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
to march out with the honors of war. The victor 
sent the Governor and soldiery off to Havana, in- 
stalled a United States collector of customs, sta- 
tioned a United States garrison in the fort, and on 
the following day set out on his way to Tennessee. 
In a five months’ campaign Jackson had estab- 
lished peace on the border, had broken the power 
of the hostile Indians, and had substantially con- 
quered Florida. Not a white man in his army had 
been killed in battle, and not even the most extrava- 
gant eulogist could aver that the war had been a 
great military triumph. None the less, the people 
— especially in the West and South — were in- 
tensely pleased. Life in the frontier regions would 
now be safer; and the acquisition of the coveted 
Florida country was brought appreciably nearer. 
The popular sentiment on the latter subject found 
characteristic expression in a toast at a banquet 
given at Nashville in honor of the returning con- 
queror: “Pensacola — Spanish perfidy and Indian 
barbarity rendered its capture necessary. May 
our Government never surrender it from the fear 
of war!” 
It was easy enough for Jackson to “take” 
Florida and for the people to rejoice in the exploit. 
To defend or explain away the irregular features
-P-A-G-E-66
THE “ CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 61 
of the act was, however, quite a different matter; 
and that was the task which fell to the authorities 
at Washington. “The territory of a friendly power 
had been invaded, its officers deposed, its towns 
and fortresses taken possession of; two citizens of 
another friendly and powerful nation had been 
executed in scandalously summary fashion, upon 
suspicion rather than evidence.” The Spanish 
Minister, Onis, wrathfully protested to the Sec- 
retary of State and demanded that Jackson be 
punished; while from London Rush quoted Castle- 
reagh as saying that English feeling was so wrought 
up that war could be produced by the raising 
of a finger. 
Monroe and his Cabinet were therefore given 
mInany anxious days and sleepless nights. They 
wanted to buy Florida, not conquer it. They had 
entertained no thought of authorizing the things 
that Jackson had done. They recognized that the 
Tennesseean’s crude notions of international law 
could not be upheld in dealings with proud Euro- 
pean States. Yet it was borne in upon them from 
every side that the nation approved what had been 
done; and the politically ambitious might well 
think twice before casting any slur upon the acts 
of the people’s hero. Moreover the irascibility of
-P-A-G-E-67
62 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
the conqueror himself was known and feared. Cal- 
houn, the Secretary of War, who was specially 
annoyed because his instructions had not been 
followed, favored a public censure. On the other 
hand, John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State, 
took the ground that everything that Jackson had 
done was “defensive and incident to his main duty 
to crush the Seminoles.” The Administration 
finally reached the decision to surrender the posts 
but otherwise to back up the General, in the hope 
of convincing Spain of the futility of trying longer 
to hold Florida. Monroe explained the necessities 
of the situation to Jackson as tactfully as he could, 
leaving him under the impression — which was 
corrected only in 1830— that Crawford, rather 
than Calhoun, was the member of the Cabinet 
who had held out against him. 
But the controversy spread beyond the Cabinet 
circle. During the winter of 1818-19 Congress 
took it up, and a determined effort was made to 
carry a vote of censure. The debate in the House 
— with galleries crowded to suffocation, we are in- 
formed by the National Intelligencer — lasted four 
weeks and was notable for bringing Clay for the 
first time publicly into opposition to the Tennes- 
seean. The resolutions containing the censure
-P-A-G-E-68
THE “ CONQUEST” OF FLORIDA 63 
were voted down, however, by a majority of almost 
two to one. In the Senate a select committee, 
after a laborious investigation, brought in an un- 
favorable report, but no further action was taken. 
When the discussion in Congress was at its 
height, Jackson himself appeared in Washington. 
Certain friends at the capital, fearing that his out- 
bursts of temper would prejudice his case, urged 
him to remain at home, but others assured him 
that his presence was needed. To his neighbor, 
Major Lewis, Jackson confided: “A lot of d d 
rascals, with Clay at their head — and maybe with 
Adams in the rear-guard — are setting up a con- 
spiracy against me. I’m going there to see it out 
with them.” 
Until vindicated by the House vote, he remained 
quietly in his hotel. After that he felt free to pay 
and receive calls, attend dinners, and accept the 
tokens of regard which were showered upon him. 
It was now that he paid his first visit to a number 
of the larger eastern cities. Philadelphia féted him 
four days. In New York the freedom of the city 
was presented by the mayor on a delicately in- 
scribed parchment enclosed in a gold box, and 
Tammany gave a great dinner at which the lead- 
ing guest, to the dismay of the young Van Buren  
-P-A-G-E-69
64 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
and other supporters of Crawford, toasted DeWitt 
Clinton, the leader of the opposing Republican 
faction. At Baltimore there was a dinner, and the 
city council asked the visitor to sit for a picture by 
Peale for the adornment of the council room. Here 
the General was handed a copy of the Senate com- 
mittee’s report, abounding in strictures on his 
Seminole campaign. Hastening back to Washing- 
ton, he filled the air with threats, and was narrowly 
prevented from personally assaulting a member of 
the investigating committee. When, however, it 
appeared that the report was to be allowed to re- 
pose for all time on the table, Jackson’s indigna- 
tion cooled, and soon he was on his way back to 
Tennessee. With him went the news that Adams 
and Onis had signed a treaty of “‘amity, settle- 
ments, and limits,” whereby for a consideration of 
five million dollars the sovereignty of all Florida 
was transferred to the United States. This treaty, 
as Jackson viewed it, was the crowning vindication 
of the acts which had been called in question; and 
public sentiment agreed with him. 
Dilatory tactics on the part of the Madrid Gov- 
ernment delayed the actual transfer of the territory 
more than two years. After having twice refused, 
Jackson at length accepted the governorship of
-P-A-G-E-70
THE “CONQUEST ” OF FLORIDA 65 
Florida, and in the early summer of 1821 he set out, 
by way of New Orleans, for his new post. Mrs. 
Jackson went with him, although she had no liking 
for either the territory or its people. On the morn- 
ing of the 17th of July the formal transfer took 
place. A procession was formed, consisting of such 
American soldiers as were on the spot. A ship’s 
band briskly played The Star Spangled Banner and 
the new Governor rode proudly at the fore as the 
procession moved along Main Street to the govern- 
ment house, where ex-Governor Callava with his 
staff was in waiting. The Spanish flag was hauled 
down, the American was run up, the keys were 
handed over, and the remaining members of the 
garrison were sent off to the vessels which on the 
morrow were to bear them on their way to Cuba. 
Only Callava and a few other officials and mer- 
chants stayed behind to close up matters of public 
and private business. 
Jackson’s governorship was brief and stormy. 
In the first place, he had no taste for administra- 
tive routine, and he found no such opportunity 
as he had hoped for to confer favors upon his 
friends. “I am sure our stay here will not be long,” 
wrote Mrs. Jackson to a brother in early August. 
“This office does not suit my husband... . 
5
-P-A-G-E-71
66 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
There never was a man more disappointed than he 
has been. He has not the power to appoint one of 
his friends.” In the second place, the new Gover- 
nor’s status was wholly anomalous, since Congress 
had extended to the territory only the revenue and 
anti-slave-trade laws, leaving Jackson to exercise 
in other matters the rather vague powers of the 
captain general of Cuba and of the Spanish gover- 
- nors of the Floridas. And in the third place, before 
his first twenty-four hours were up, the new execu- 
tive fell into a desperate quarrel with his prede- 
cessor, a man of sufficiently similar temperament 
to make the contest a source of sport for the gods. 
Jackson was prepared to believe the worst of any 
Spaniard, and his relations with Callava grew 
steadily more strained until finally, with a view to 
obtaining possession of certain deeds and other 
legal papers, he had the irate dignitary shut up 
overnight in the calaboose. Then he fell upon 
the judge of the Western District of Florida for 
issuing a writ of habeas corpus in the Spaniard’s 
behalf; and all parties — Jackson, Callava, and the 
- judge — swamped the wearied officials at Wash- 
ington with “statements” and “exhibitions” set- 
ting forth in lurid phraseology their respective 
views upon the questions involved. Callava finally
-P-A-G-E-72
THE “ CONQUEST * OF FLORIDA 67 
carried his complaints to the capital in person 
and stirred the Spanish Minister to a fresh bom- 
bardment of the White House. Monroe’s Cabinet 
spent three days discussing the subject, without 
coming to a decision. Many were in honest doubt 
as to the principles of law involved; some were 
fearful of the political effects of any stand they 
might take; all were inexpressibly relieved when, 
late in the year, word came that “Don Andrew 
Jackson” had resigned the governorship and was 
proposing to retire to private life at the Hermitage.
-P-A-G-E-73
CHAPTER IV 
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 
On a bracing November afternoon in 1821 Jackson 
rode up with his family to the Hermitage free for 
the first time in thirty-two years from all responsi- 
bility of civil and military office. He was now 
fifty-four years old and much broken by exposure 
and disease; the prospect of spending the remainder 
of his days among his hospitable neighbors on the 
banks of the Cumberland yielded deep satisfaction. 
The home-loving Mrs. Jackson, too, earnestly de- 
sired that he should not again be drawn into the 
swirl of public life. ‘I do hope,” she wrote plain- 
tively to a niece soon after her return to the Her- 
mitage, “they will leave Mr. Jackson alone. He is 
not a well man and never will be unless they allow 
him to rest. He has done his share for the country. 
How little time has he had to himself or for his own 
interests in the thirty years of our wedded life. 
In all that time he has not spent one-fourth of his 
68
-P-A-G-E-74
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 69 
days under his own roof. The rest of the time 
away, traveling, holding court, or at the capital of 
the country, or in camp, or fighting its battles, or 
treating with the Indians; mercy knows what not.” 
The intent to retire was honest enough but not so 
easy to carry out. The conqueror of the Creeks 
and Seminoles belonged not merely to Tennessee 
but to the entire Southwest; the victor of New Or- 
leans belonged to the Nation. Already there was 
talk — “‘talk everlastingly,”’ Mrs. Jackson tells us 
in the letter just quoted — of making the hero 
President. Jackson, furthermore, was not the type 
of man to sit idly by while great scenes were en- 
acted on the political stage. When he returned 
from Florida, he faced the future with the weary 
vision of a sick man. Rest and reviving strength, 
however, put the old vim into his words and acts. 
In two years he was a second time taking a seat 
in the United States Senate, in three he was con- 
testing for the presidency, and in seven he was 
moving into the White House. 
The glimpses which one gets of the General’s 
surroundings and habits during his brief interval of 
repose create a pleasing impression. Following the 
winding turnpike westward from Nashville a dis- 
tance of nine or ten miles and rumbling across the

old wooden bridge over Stone River, a visitor 
would find himself at Hermitage Farm. The estate 
contained at that time somewhat more than a 
thousand acres, of which four hundred were under 
cultivation and the remainder luxuriant forest. 
Negro cabins stood here and there, and in one 
corner was a little brick church which the proprie- 
tor had built for the solace of his wife. In the 
center of a well-kept lawn, flanked with cedars and 
oaks, stood the family mansion, the Hermitage, 
whose construction had been begun at the close 
of the Seminole War in 1819. The building was 
of brick, two stories high, with a double wooden 
piazza in both front and rear. The rooms were 
small and simply furnished, the chief adornment 
being portraits of the General and his friends, 
though later was added the familiar painting of 
Mrs. Jackson. Lavasseur, who as private secre- 
tary of La Fayette visited the place in 1825, was 
greatly surprised to find a person of Jackson’s re- 
nown living in a structure which in France would 
hardly suffice for the porter’s lodge at the chateau 
of a man of similar standing. But western Ten- 
nessee afforded nothing finer, and Jackson con- 
sidered himself palatially housed. 
Life on the Hermitage estate had its full share
-P-A-G-E-76
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 7 
of the charm of the old South. After breakfasting 
at eight or nine, the proprietor spent the day riding 
over his broad acres, giving instructions to his 
workmen, keeping up his accounts, chatting with 
neighbors and passers-by, and devouring the news- 
papers with a zeal born of unremitting interest in 
public affairs. After the evening meal the family 
gathered on the cool piazza in summer, or around 
the blazing hearth of the great living room in 
winter, and spent the hours until the early bed- 
time in telling stories, discussing local and national 
happenings, or listening to the news of distant 
localities as retailed by the casual visitor. The 
hospitality of the Jackson home was proverbial. 
The General’s army friends came often to see him. 
Political leaders and advisers flocked to the place. 
Clergymen of all denominations were received with 
special warmth by Mrs. Jackson. Eastern men of 
distinction, when traveling to the West, came to 
pay their respects. No foreigner who penetrated 
as far as the Mississippi Valley would think of re- 
turning to his native land without calling upon the 
picturesque figure at the Hermitage. 
Chief among visitors from abroad was La Fay- 
ette. The two men met in Washington in 1824 
and formed an instant attachment for each other.
-P-A-G-E-77
72 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
The great French patriot was greeted at Nashville 
the following year with a public reception and 
banquet at which Jackson, as the first citizen of the 
State, did the honors. Afterwards he spent some 
days in the Jackson home, and one can imagine the 
avidity with which the two men discussed the 
American and French revolutions, Napoleon, and 
the late New Orleans campaign. 
Jackson was first and last a democrat. He never 
lost touch with the commonest people. Neverthe- 
less there was always something of the grand 
manner about him. On formal and ceremonial 
occasions he bore himself with becoming dignity 
and even grace; in dress he was, as a rule, punc- 
tilious. During his years at the Hermitage he was 
accustomed to ride about in a carriage drawn by 
four spirited iron-gray horses, attended by servants 
in blue livery with brass buttons, glazed hats, and 
silver bands. “‘A very big man, sir,” declared an 
old hotel waiter to the visiting biographer Parton 
long afterwards. “We had many big men, sir, in 
Nashville at that time, but General Jackson was 
the biggest man of them all. I knew the General, 
sir; but he always had so many people around him 
when he came to town that it was not often I could 
get a chance to say anything to him.”
-P-A-G-E-78
THE DEATH OF “ KING, CAUCUS” 73 
The question as to who first proposed Jackson 
for the presidency will probably never be answered. 
The victory at New Orleans evidently brought the 
idea into many minds. As the campaign of 1816 
was beginning, Aaron Burr wrote to his son-in-law 
that, if the country wanted a President of firmness 
and decision, “that man is Andrew Jackson.” Not 
apparently until 1821 was the suggestion put for- 
ward in such a way as to lead Jackson himself to 
take note of it. Even then he scoffed at it. Toa 
friend who assured him that he was not “safe from 
the presidency ” in 1824, he replied: “I really hope 
you don’t think that I am d —— fool enough to 
believe that. No sir; I may be pretty well satisfied 
with myself in some things, but am not vain enough 
for that.” On another occasion he declared: “No 
sir; I know what I am fit for. I can command a 
body of men in a rough way; but I am not fit 
to be President.” 
It really mattered little what the General himself 
thought. His Tennessee friends had conceived the 
idea that he could be elected, and already they 
were at work to realize this vision. One of the 
most active was John H. Eaton, who had lately 
written the hero’s biography down to the return 
from New Orleans. Another of his friends was
-P-A-G-E-79
74 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Governor Blount. John Rhea, Felix Grundy, and 
half a dozen more helped. But the man who 
really made Jackson President was his near neigh- 
bor and his inseparable companion of later years, 
William B. Lewis. 
In a day of astute politicians Major Lewis was 
one of the cleverest. He knew Jackson more in- 
timately than did any other man and could sway 
him readily to his purposes in all matters upon 
which the General’s mind was not absolutely made 
up. He had a wide acquaintance over the country; 
he was possessed of ample means and leisure; he 
was an adept at pulling judiciously laid and well- 
concealed political wires; he fully understood the 
ideas, aspirations, and feelings of the classes whose 
support was necessary to the success of his plans. 
In the present juncture he worked on two main 
lines: first, to arouse Jackson’s own State to a 
feverish enthusiasm for the candidacy of its “‘favor- 
ite son,” and, second, to start apparently spon- 
taneous Jackson movements in various sections of 
the country, in such a manner that their cumula- 
tive effect would be to create an impression of a 
nation-wide and irresistible demand for the victor 
of New Orleans as a candidate. 
Tennessee was easily stirred. That the General
-P-A-G-E-80
‘THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 15 
merited the highest honor within the gift of the 
people required no argument among his fellow 
citizens. The first open steps were taken in Janu- 
ary, 1822, when the Gazette and other Nashville 
papers sounded the clarion call. The response was 
overwhelming; and when Jackson himself, in reply 
to a letter from Grundy, diplomatically declared 
that he would “neither seek nor shun” the presi- 
dency, his candidacy was regarded as an estab- 
lished fact. On the 20th of July, the Legislature 
of the State placed him formally in nomination. 
Meanwhile Lewis had gone to North Carolina 
to work up sentiment there, and by the close of 
the year assurances of support were coming in 
satisfactorily. From being skeptical or at best in- 
different, Jackson himself had come to share the 
enthusiasm of his assiduous friends. 
The Jackson managers banked from the first 
upon two main assets: one was the exceptional 
popularity of their candidate, especially in the 
South and West; the other was a political situation 
so muddled that at the coming election it might be 
made to yield almost any result. For upwards of a 
generation the presidency and vice presidency had 
been at the disposal of a working alliance of Vir- 
ginia and New York, buttressed by such support
-P-A-G-E-81
76 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
as was needed from other controllable States. 
Virginia regularly got the presidency, New York 
(except at the time of the Clinton defection of 
1812) the vice presidency. After the second elec- 
tion of Monroe, in 1820, however, there were mul- 
tiplying signs that this affiliation of interests had 
reached the end of its tether. In the first place, the 
Virginia dynasty had run out; at all events Vir- 
ginia had no candidate to offer and was preparing 
to turn its support to a Georgian of Virginian birth, 
William H. Crawford. In the second place, party 
lines had totally disappeared, and the unifying and 
stabilizing influences of party names and affilia- 
tions could not be counted on to keep down the 
number of independent candidacies. Already, in- 
deed, by the end of 1822 there were a half-dozen 
avowed candidates, three of whom had seats at 
Monroe’s Cabinet table. Each was the representa- 
tive of a section or of a distinct interest, rather than 
of a party, and no one was likely to feel under any 
compulsion to withdraw from the race at a pre- 
liminary stage. 
New England offered John Quincy Adams. She 
did so with reluctance, for the old Federalist ele- 
ments had never forgiven him for his desertion to 
the Republican camp in the days of the embargo,
-P-A-G-E-82
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 717 
while the back country democracy had always 
looked upon him as an alien. But he was the sec- 
tion’s only available man — indeed, the only prom- 
ising candidate from any Northern State. His 
frigid manner was against him. But he had had 
a long and honorable diplomatic career; he was 
winning new distinction as Secretary of State; and 
he could expect to profit both by the feeling that 
the North was entitled to the presidency and by 
the fact that he was the only candidate from a 
non-slave State. 
Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, was the 
heir apparent of the Virginia dynasty. Formerly 
this would have meant a clear road to the White 
House. Even now it was supposed to be a tremen- 
dous asset; and notwithstanding the Georgian’s per- 
sonal unpopularity in most parts of the country, his 
coupled « ” advantages as the “regular candidate, 
with the long and careful campaign carried on in 
his behalf, were expected by many keen observers 
to pull him through. 
A third candidate within the Cabinet circle 
was Calhoun, Secretary of War. Like Crawford, 
he could expect to reach the presidency only 
by winning the support of one or more of the 
greater Northern States. For a while he had
-P-A-G-E-83
78 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
hopes of Pennsylvania. When it appeared that 
he had nothing to look for in this direction, he 
resigned himself to the conclusion that, since he 
was yet hardly forty years of age, his time had 
not yet come. 
For the first time, the West now put forward 
candidates —- two of them, Clay and Jackson. 
Clay was a Kentuckian, of Virginian birth and 
breeding, in whom were mingled the leading char- 
acteristics of both his native and his adopted sec- 
tion. He was “impetuous, wilful, high-spirited, 
daring, jealous, but, withal, a lovable man.” For 
a decade he had been the most conspicuous figure 
in the national House of Representatives. He had 
raised the speakership to a high level of impor- 
tance and through its power had fashioned a set of 
issues, reflective of western and middle-state ideas, 
upon which the politics of the country turned for 
more than a quarter of a century. As befitted a 
“great conciliator,” he had admirers in every 
corner of the land. Whether his strength could 
be sufficiently massed to yield electoral results 
remained to be discovered. 
But what of Jackson? If, as one writer has said, 
Clay was one of the favorites of the West, Jackson 
was the West itself. “While Clay was able to
-P-A-G-E-84
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 79 
voice, with statesmanlike ability, the demand for 
economic legislation to promote her interests, and 
while he exercised an extraordinary fascination 
by his personal magnetism and his eloquence, he 
never became the hero of the great masses of the 
West; he appealed rather to the more intelligent — 
to the men of business and of property.”* Jackson, 
however, was the very personification of the con- 
tentious, self-confident, nationalistic democracy of 
the interior. He could make no claim to states- 
manship. He had held no important legislative or 
administrative position in his State, and his brief 
career in Congress was entirely without distinction. 
He was a man of action, not a theorist, and his 
views on public questions were, even as late as 
1820, not clear cut or widely known. In a general 
way he represented the school of Randolph and 
Monroe, rather than that of Jefferson and Madison. 
He was a moderate protectionist, because he be- 
lieved that domestic manufactures would make 
the United States independent of European coun- 
tries in time of war. On the Bank and internal 
improvements his mind was not made up, although 
he was inclined to regard both as unconstitutional. 
Jackson’s attitude toward the leading political 
” = Turner, Rise of the New West, p. 188.
-P-A-G-E-85
80 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
personalities of the time left no room for doubt. 
He supported Monroe in 1816 and in 1820 and 
continued on friendly terms with him notwith- 
standing the President’s failure on certain occa- 
sions to follow his advice. Among the new con- 
tenders for the presidency the one he disliked most 
was Crawford. ‘“‘As to Wm. H. Crawford,” he 
wrote to a friend in 1821, “you know my opinion. 
I would support the Devil first.” Clay, also, he 
disliked — partly out of recollection of the Ken- 
tuckian’s censorious attitude during the Seminole 
debates, partly because of the natural rivalry be- 
tween the two men for the favor of the western 
people. Clay fully reciprocated by refusing to 
believe that “killing 2500 Englishmen at New 
Orleans” qualified Jackson for the “various difficult 
and complicated duties of the chief magistracy.” 
Toward Adams, Jackson was not ill disposed; 
before he decided to permit his own name to be 
used, he said that he would give his support in 
1824 to the New Englander — unless one other 
person should be brought forward. That person 
was Calhoun, for whom, among all the candidates 
of the day, he thus far had the warmest regard. 
Among so many aspirants — and not all have 
been mentioned — how should the people make up
-P-A-G-E-86
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 81 
their minds? In earlier days the party caucuses 
in Congress would have eliminated various candi- 
dates, and the voters would have found themselves 
called upon to make a choice between probably but 
two opponents. The caucus was an informal, vol- 
untary gathering of the party members in the two 
houses to canvass the political situation and decide 
upon the men to be supported by the rank and 
file of the party for the presidency and vice presi- 
dency. In the lack of other nominating machin- 
ery itserved a useful purpose, and nominations had 
been commonly made in this manner from 1796 on- 
wards. There were obvious objections to the plan 
— chiefly that the authority exercised was assumed 
tather than delegated — and, as the campaign of 
1824 approached, opposition flared up in a very 
impressive manner. 
Crawford, as the “regular”? candidate, wanted 
a caucus, and his adherents supported him in 
the wish. But all his rivals were opposed to it, 
partly because they felt that they could not gain a 
caucus nomination, partly because their followers 
generally objected to the system. “King Caucus” 
became the target of general criticism. News- 
papers, except those for Crawford, denounced the 
old system; legislatures passed resolutions against 
6
-P-A-G-E-87
82 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
it; public meetings condemned it; ponderous 
pamphlets were hurled at it; the campaigns of 
Jackson and Clay, in particular, found their key- 
note in hostility toward it. Failing to perceive 
that under the changed circumstances a caucus 
nomination might become a liability rather than 
an asset, the Crawford element pushed its plans, 
and on February 14, 1824, a caucus — destined to 
be the last of the kind in the country — was duly 
held. It proved a fiasco, for it was attended 
by only sixty-six persons. Crawford was “‘recom- 
mended to the people of the United States” by an 
almost unanimous vote, but the only effect was 
to infuse fresh energy into the campaigns of his 
leading competitors. “The caucus,” wrote Daniel 
Webster to his brother Ezekiel, “has hurt nobody 
but its friends.” 
For the first time in eight years the country 
witnessed a real presidential contest. The cam- 
paign, none the less, was one in which the candi- 
dates themselves took but little active part. The 
days of “swinging around the circle” had not yet 
dawned in our national politics, nor had even those 
of the “front-porch” campaign. Adams made no 
effort either to be nominated or to be elected, re- 
taining throughout the contest that austere reserve
-P-A-G-E-88
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 83 
in public manner which contrasted so singularly 
with his amiability and good humor in private life. 
Jackson remained quietly at the Hermitage, reply- 
ing to correspondents and acknowledging expres- 
sions of support, but leaving to his managers the 
work of winning the voters. Clay, whose oratorical 
gifts would have made him an invincible twentieth 
century campaigner, contented himself with a few 
interviews and speeches. The candidate who nor- 
mally would have taken most active personal part 
in the campaign was Crawford. But in August, 
1823 — six months before the caucus nomination 
—he was stricken with paralysis and rendered 
speechless, almost blind, and practically helpless. 
For months he hovered between life and death in a 
“mansion” on the outskirts of Washington, while 
his friends labored to conceal the seriousness of his 
condition and to keep his canvass going. Gradu- 
ally he rallied; but his powerful frame was shat- 
tered, and even when the caucus discharged its 
appointed task of nominating him, the politicians 
were cold-heartedly speculating upon who would 
receive the “old republican” support if he should 
die. He recovered and lived ten years; but his 
chances of the presidency were much diminished 
by his ill fortune. “He had fallen with his face
-P-A-G-E-89
84 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
toward the goal, with his eyes and his heart 
fixed upon it.” 
As the canvass progressed, Jackson steadily 
gained. His election to the United States Senate, 
in the autumn of 1823, over a stanch supporter of 
Crawford showed that his own State was acting in 
good faith when it proposed him for the higher 
position. Clever propaganda turned Pennsylvania 
‘Jackson mad’’; whereupon Calhoun, with an eye 
to the future, sought an alliance with his competi- 
tor. The upshot was that a convention held at 
Harrisburg in March, 1824, nominated Jackson 
almost unanimously and named Calhoun for the 
vice presidency. Hostility to the caucus became 
also a great asset. Tariff, internal improvements, 
and foreign policy were discussed in the campaign, 
but the real issue was the manner of selecting the 
President. Should he continue to be chosen by a 
combination of Congressmen, or should the people 
take matters into their own hands? Impatience 
with the caucus system showed itself in numerous 
nominations of Clay, Adams, and Jackson by sun- 
dry state conventions, legislatures, and other more 
or less official bodies. The supporters of Jack- 
son, in particular, made “down with the caucus” 
their rallying cry and found it tremendously
-P-A-G-E-90
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 85 
effective. In the earlier stages of the campaign 
the politicians, aside from Lewis and his cowork- 
ers, were unwilling to believe that Jackson could 
be elected. Later, however, they were forced to 
acknowledge his strength, and at the end the 
fight was really between Jackson and the field, 
rather than between Crawford and the field as 
had been anticipated. 
At the beginning of November, Jackson, accom- 
panied by his wife and traveling in a handsome 
coach drawn by four of the finest Hermitage 
thoroughbreds, set out for Washington. Hostile 
scribblers lost no time in contrasting this display of 
grandeur with the republican simplicity of Jeffer- 
son, who rode from Monticello to the capital on the 
back of a plantation nag without pedigree. But 
Jackson was not perturbed. At various points 
on the road he received returns from the elections, 
and when after four or five weeks the equipage 
drew up in the capital Jackson knew the general 
result. Calhoun had been elected vice president 
with little opposition. But no one of the presiden- 
tial candidates had obtained an electoral majority, 
and the task of choosing among the highest three 
would, under the terms of the Constitution, de- 
volve upon the House of Representatives. When,
-P-A-G-E-91
86 ‘tHE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
by the middle of December, the returns were all in, 
it was found that Jackson would have 99 votes in 
the electoral college, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and 
Clay 37. 
The country awaited the 9th of February — the 
day of the official count — with great interest. 
Clay was, of course, eliminated. Crawford like- 
wise, by reason of his poor showing and the pre- 
carious state of his health, could not expect to do 
more than hold his own. The contest had nar- 
rowed to Jackson and Adams, with Clay holding 
the balance. There were twenty-four States in the 
Union; the successful candidate must command 
the votes of thirteen. 
The choice that Clay now had to make was dis- 
tasteful, although not really difficult. Jackson had 
obtained a substantial plurality of the electoral 
votes; he probably had a plurality of the popular 
vote, although in the six States in which the elec- 
tors were chosen by the Legislature the popular 
vote could not be computed; the Legislature of 
Clay’s own State called upon the Congressmen 
from the State to give the Tennesseean its support. 
But Clay had felt very bitterly about the candi- 
dacy of “this military chieftain.” Furthermore, 
he knew that if Jackson were to be elected, the
-P-A-G-E-92
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” = 87 
country would not be disposed to take his successor 
from the West. Besides, Calhoun had put himself 
in line for the Jacksonian succession. On the other 
hand, Clay was not without grievances against 
Adams. The New Englander had captured the cov- 
eted Secretaryship of State in Monroe’s Cabinet; 
he had taken no pains to conceal his dislike of the 
Kentucky “gamester in politics’’; his foreign policy 
had been the target of many of Clay’s keenest 
oratorical thrusts. But the country would be safe 
in his hands; and a popular westerner might well 
hope to become his successor. The decision in 
favor of Adams was reached with little delay and 
was confided to intimates almost two months before 
the House balloted. Though Clay’s choice did not 
insure the election of Adams, it made that outcome 
extremely probable. 
As the weeks passed, the situation became more 
tense. All the principals in the drama were at the 
capital — Adams as Secretary of State, Crawford 
as Secretary of the Treasury, Clay as Speaker of 
the House, Jackson as Senator — and the city was 
filled with followers who busied themselves in pro- 
posing combinations and making promises which, 
for the greater part, could not be traced to the 
candidates themselves. O’Neil’s Tavern — graced
-P-A-G-E-93
88 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
by the vivacious “Peggy,” who, as Mrs. John H. 
Eaton, was later to upset the equilibrium of the 
Jackson Administration — and other favorite lodg- 
ing houses were the scenes of midnight conferences, 
intimate conversations, and mysterious comings 
and goings which kept their oldest and most sophis- 
ticated frequenters on the alert. ‘“‘Incedo super 
ignes —I walk over fires,” confided the strait- 
laced Adams to his diary, and not without reason. 
A group of Clay’s friends came to the New Eng- 
lander’s room to urge in somewhat veiled language 
that their chief be promised, in return for his 
support, a place in the Cabinet. A Missouri repre- 
sentative who held the balance of power in his 
delegation plainly offered to swing the State for 
Adams if the latter would agree to retain a brother 
on the federal bench and be “reasonable” in the 
matter of patronage. 
By the last week of January it was rather gen- 
erally understood that Clay’s strength would be 
thrown to Adams. Up to this time the Jackson 
men had refused to believe that such a thing could 
happen. But evidence had been piled mountain- 
high; adherents of both allies were openly boasting 
of the arrangements that had been made. The 
Jacksonians were furious, and the air was filled
-P-A-G-E-94
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” = 89 
with recriminations. On January 28, 1825, an 
anonymous letter in the Columbian Observer of 
Philadelphia made the direct charge that the 
agents of Clay had offered the Kentuckian’s sup- 
port to both Jackson and Adams in return for an 
appointment as Secretary of State, and that, while 
the friends of Jackson would not descend to “such 
mean barter and sale,” a bargain with the Adams 
forces had been duly closed. Clay’s rage was un- 
governable. Through the columns of the National 
Intelligencer he pronounced his unknown antago- 
nist “‘a base and infamous calumniator, a dastard 
and a liar,” called upon him to “unveil himself,” 
and declared that he would hold him responsible 
“to all the laws which govern and regulate men 
of honor.” 
Two days later an obscure Pennsylvania Con- 
gressman by the name of George Kremer tendered 
his respects to “the Honorable H. Clay,” avowed 
his authorship of the communication in question, 
offered to prove the truth of his charges, and closed 
sententiously by affirming that as a representative 
of the people he would “not fear to ‘ery aloud and 
spare not’ when their rights and privileges are at 
stake.” The matter was serious, but official Wash- 
ington could hardly repress a smile. Kremer was
-P-A-G-E-95
90 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
a thoroughly honest but grossly illiterate rustic 
busybody who thus far had attracted the capital’s 
attention mainly by reason of his curiously cut 
leopard-skin overcoat. The real author of the 
charge seems to have been James Buchanan, and 
Kremer was simple-minded and credulous enough 
tc be made the catspaw in the business. Clay 
was taken aback. Kremer significantly made no 
reference to the “code of honor’’; and since a duel 
with such a personage would be an absurdity, 
Clay substituted a request that the House make 
an immediate investigation of the charges. A 
committee of seven was appointed. But when it 
summoned Kremer to give his testimony, he re- 
fused to appear, on the ground — which in the 
present instance was a mere pretext — that the 
House had no jurisdiction over the conduct of 
its members outside the chamber. 
The truth of the matter is that Kremer was only 
a tool in the hands of the Jackson managers. He 
admitted privately to members of the committee 
that he did not write the letter in the Observer, and 
it was plain enough that he did not understand its 
purport. His promise to substantiate its contents 
was made in a moment of surprise, because some- 
body had neglected to coach him on the point.
-P-A-G-E-96
THE DEATH OF “KING CAUCUS” 91 
Finding that it could make no headway, the com- 
mittee reported the fact, on the 9th of February, 
and the investigation was dropped. This was pre- 
cisely what the Jackson managers wanted. What- 
ever happened, Jackson would be the gainer. “If 
Clay transferred his following to Adams, the 
charge would gain credence with the masses; if he 
were not made Secretary of State, it would be 
alleged that honest George Kremer (an ardent 
Jacksonian) had exposed the bargain and pre- 
vented its consummation.”’* 
Was this charge of a “corrupt bargain” well 
founded? For a generation every public man had 
views on that subject for which he was ready to 
fight; mid-century and later historians came to 
conclusions of the most contradictory nature. The 
pros and cons are too complicated to be presented 
here, but certain things are fairly clear. In two 
elaborate speeches Clay marshaled evidence that 
before leaving Kentucky he decided to support 
Adams in preference to Jackson and Crawford. 
This evidence did not convince the Jacksonians; 
but it could hardly have been expected to do so, 
and nowadays it looks to be unimpeachable. It is 
certain that the friends of Clay approached the 
tTuruer, Rise of the New West, p. 268, 2
-P-A-G-E-97
92 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Adams managers with a view to a working agree- 
ment involving the Secretaryship of State; but it 
is equally clear that the Jackson and Crawford 
men solicited Clay’s support “by even more 
unblushing offers of political reward than those 
alleged against Adams.” Finally it is known that 
Adams gave some explicit preélection pledges, and 
that by doing so he drew some votes; but on the 
subject of an alliance with Clay he is not known to 
have gone further than to say to a delegation of 
Clay supporters that if elected by western votes 
he would naturally look to the West for much of 
the support which his Administration would need. 
At noon, on the 9th of February, the Senate and 
House met in joint session to witness the count of 
the electoral vote. Spectators packed the galleries 
and overflowed into every available space. The 
first acts were of a purely formal nature. Then 
the envelopes were opened; the votes were counted; 
Calhoun was declared elected to the vice presi- 
dency; and it was announced that no candidate 
for the presidency had received a majority. Then 
the senators withdrew, and the representatives 
addressed themselves to the task which the Con- 
stitution devolved upon them. The members of 
each delegation took their seats together; the vote
-P-A-G-E-98
THE DEATH OF “ KING CAUCUS” 93 
of each State was placed in a separate box on a 
table; and Daniel Webster and John Randolph, 
acting as tellers, opened the boxes and tabulated 
the results. No one expected the first ballot to be 
decisive; indeed the friends of Crawford, who were 
present in large numbers, were pinning their hopes 
to the possibility that after repeated ballotings the 
House would break the deadlock between Jackson 
and Adams by turning to their candidate. A hush 
fell upon the expectant assemblage as Webster rose 
to announce the result; and seasoned politicians 
could hardly trust their ears when they heard: 
Adams, thirteen votes; Jackson, seven; Crawford, 
four. An eleventh-hour change of mind by a New 
York representative had thrown the vote of that 
State into the Adams column and had thereby 
assured the triumph of the New Englander. 
That evening Jackson and Adams came face to 
face at.a presidential levee, Jackson with a lady on 
his right arm. Each man hesitated an instant, and 
spectators wondered what was going to happen. 
But those who were looking for a sensation were 
disappointed. Reaching out his long arm, the 
General said in his most cordial manner: “How do 
you do, Mr. Adams? I give you my left hand, for 
the right, as you see, is devoted to the fair: I hope
-P-A-G-E-99
94 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
you are very well, sir.” The reply came in clear 
but icy tones: “Very well, sir; I hope General Jack- 
son is well.”’ Itis the testimony of an unprejudiced 
observer that of the two, the defeated Tennesseean 
bore himself more graciously than the victorious 
New Englander. 
Two days later Adams, following a conference 
with Monroe, invited upon his head the fires of 
heaven by announcing that he had decided to 
appoint Clay Secretary of State, ‘considering it 
due to his talents and services to the western 
section of the United States, whence he comes, 
and to the confidence in me manifested by their 
delegations.”
-P-A-G-E-100
CHAPTER V 
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 
Monror’s Administration drew to a close in a mel- 
low sunset of popular approval. But no prophetic 
genius was required to foresee that clouds of dis- 
content and controversy would hang heavy about 
the head of his successor. Adams certainly did 
not expect it to be otherwise. ‘“‘ Prospects are flat- 
tering for the immediate issue,” he recorded in his 
diary shortly before the election, “‘but the fearful 
condition of them is that success would open to a 
far severer trial than defeat.” The darkest fore- 
bodings were more than realized. No one of our 
chief executives, except possibly Andrew Johnson, 
was ever the target of more relentless and vindic- 
tive attacks. 
Adams was, in the first place, a minority Presi- 
dent. Jackson’s popular vote was probably larger; 
his electoral vote was certainly so; and the vote 
in the House of Representatives was at the last 
95
-P-A-G-E-101
396 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
moment swung to Adams only by certain un- 
expected and more or less accidental developments. 
By thus receiving his office at the hands of a 
branch of Congress, in competition with a candi- 
date who had a wider popular support, the New 
Englander fell heir to all the indignation that 
had been aroused against congressional intrigue, 
and especially against the selection of a President 
by Congressmen. 
There was, in addition, the charge of a “corrupt 
bargain.” It mattered not greatly whether the 
accusation was true or not. The people widely 
accepted it as true, and the Administration had 
to bear the stigma. “The coalition of Blifil and 
Black George, of the Puritan and the black-leg,” 
John Randolph called the new alliance; and while 
Clay sought to vindicate his honor in a duel with 
the author of the phrase, nothing that he or Adams 
could do or say was able to overcome the effect 
upon the public mind created by the cold fact 
that when the Clay men turned their support to 
Adams their leader was forthwith made Secretary 
of State. 
A further source of difficulty in the situation 
was the temperament of Adams himself. There 
was no abler, more honest, or more patriotic man
-P-A-G-E-102
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 97 
in public life; yet in the presidency he was, espe- 
cially at this juncture of affairs, a misfit. He was 
cold and reserved when every consideration called 
for cordiality; he was petulant when tolerance and 
good humor were the qualities most needful. He 
could neither arouse enthusiasm nor win friends. 
He was large visioned and adept at mapping out 
broad policies, but he lacked the elements of 
leadership requisite to carry his plans into effect. 
He scorned the everyday arts of politics, and by 
the very loftiness of his ideals he alienated support. 
In short, as one writer has remarked, he was ‘“‘a 
weigher of scruples and values in a time of transi- 
tion, a representative of old-school politics on the 
threshold of triumphant democracy. The people 
did not understand him, but they felt instinctively 
that he was not one of themselves; and, therefore, 
they cast him out.” Nobody had ever called him 
“Old Hickory” or any other name indicative of 
popular endearment. 
Clay’s appointment as Secretary of State was 
thoroughly typical of the independent, unyielding 
attitude of the new Administration. Adams had 
not the slightest sympathy with the idea of ro- 
tation in public position: such a policy, he 
said, would make government ‘“‘a perpetual and
-P-A-G-E-103
98 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
unremitting scramble for office.” He announced 
that there would be no removals except such as 
complaint showed to be for the good of the service, 
and only twelve removals took place during his en- 
tire term. The spoilsmen argued and fumed. The 
editor of an administration newspaper warmly told 
the President that in consequence of his policy he 
would himself be removed as soon as the term 
for which he had been elected had expired. But 
entreaties and threats were alike of no avail. Even 
Clay could not get the removal of a naval officer 
guilty of unbecoming conduct. In his zeal for 
nonpartizanship Adams fairly leaned backwards, 
with the result that incompetents were shielded 
and the offices were left in the hands of men 
who, in a very large number of cases, were openly 
hostile to the President and to his policies. 
“Less possessed of your confidence in advance 
than any of my predecessors,’ wrote Adams in his 
first message to Congress, “I am deeply conscious 
of the prospect that I shall stand more and oftener 
in need of your indulgence.” In the principles 
and measures which he urged upon the legislative 
branch, none the less, he showed small regard for 
moderation or expediency. He defined the object 
of government to be the improvement of the
-P-A-G-E-104
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 99 
condition of the people, and he refused to recog- 
nize in the federal Constitution restrictions which 
would prevent the national authorities from ful- 
filling this function in the highest degree. He 
urged not only the building of roads and canals 
but the establishment of a national university, the 
support of observatories, “the light-houses of the 
skies,” and the exploration of the interior and of 
the far northwestern parts of the country. He 
advocated heavy protective duties on goods im- 
ported from abroad, and asked Congress to pass 
laws not alone for the betterment of agriculture, 
manufactures, and trade but for the “encourage- 
ment of the mechanic and of the elegant arts, the 
advancement of literature, and the progress of the 
sciences, ornamental and profound.” He thought 
that the public lands should be sold at the high- 
est prices they would bring and that the money 
should be used by the Government to promote the 
general welfare. He had no doubt of either the 
power or the duty of the Government to maintain 
a national bank. 
Since the War of 1812 the Republicans, with 
whom Adams had been numbered, had inclined 
strongly toward a liberal construction of the 
Constitution, but none had gone to the limits
-P-A-G-E-105
100 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
marked out in this program. Besides, a strong 
reaction was now setting in. The President’s rec- 
ommendations were received in some quarters with 
astonishment, insome rather with amusement. No- 
where were they regarded, in their entirety, with 
favor. Even Clay — spokesman of nationalism 
though he was — could not follow his chief in his 
untrammeled flights. Menstill widely believed that 
the National Government ought to spend money 
freely on highways, canals, and otherimprovements. 
But by his bold avowals Adams characteristically 
threw away support for both himself and his cause; 
and the era of federal initiative and management 
was thus hastened toward its close. 
No one who knew Jackson and his political 
managers expected them to accept the anomalous 
electoral results of 1825 as expressing the real will 
of the nation, and it was a foregone conclusion not 
only that the General would again be a candidate, 
but that the campaign of 1828 would at once be- 
gin. The defeated Senator remained in Washington 
long enough to present himself at the White House 
on Inauguration Day and felicitate his successful 
rival. Then he set out on the long journey home- 
ward. Every town through Pennsylvania and 
along the Ohio turned out en masse to greet him,
-P-A-G-E-106
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 101 
and at Nashville he was given a prodigious recep- 
tion. To friends and traveling companions he 
talked constantly about the election, leaving no 
doubt of his conviction that he had been defeated 
by intrigue. Toasympathetic group of passengers 
traveling down the Ohio with him on board the 
General Neville he declared emphatically that, if he 
had been willing to make the same promises and 
offers to Clay that Adams had made, he would 
that minute be in the presidential chair. If he 
should yet attain that dignity, he added signifi- 
cantly, he would do it “with clean hands.” It is 
reported that as he spoke there was in his eye the 
fire of determination, such as his soldiers had seen 
there as he strode up and down the breastworks at 
New Orleans. 
To this point Jackson had sought the presidency 
rather at the instigation of his friends than because 
of personal desire for the office. Now all was 
changed. The people had expressed their prefer- 
ence for him, and their will had been thwarted. 
Henceforth he was moved by an inflexible purpose 
to vindicate both his own right to the position and 
the right of his fellow citizens to choose their chief 
executive without hindrance. In this determina- 
tion he was warmly backed up by his neighbors
-P-A-G-E-107
102 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
and advisers, and the machinery for a long, sys- 
tematic, and resistless campaign was speedily put 
into running order. One group of managers took 
charge in Washington. Another set to work in 
New York. A third undertook to keep Pennsy]- 
vania in line. A fourth began to consolidate sup- 
portintheSouth. At the capital the United States 
Telegraph, edited by Duff Green of Missouri, was 
established as a Jackson organ, and throughout 
the country friendly journals were set the task of 
keeping up an incessant fire upon the Adminis- 
tration and of holding the Jackson men together. 
Local committees were organized; pamphlets and 
handbills were put into circulation; receptions and 
public dinners were exploited, whenever possible, 
in the interest of the cause. First, last, and al- 
ways, Jackson’s candidacy was put forward as the 
hope and opportunity of the plain people as against 
the politicians. 
In October the Tennessee Legislature again 
placed its favorite formally in nomination, and a 
few days later the candidate resigned his seat in 
the Senate in order to be more advantageously 
situated for carrying on his campaign. For more 
than a year he remained quietly at the Hermitage, 
dividing his attention between his blooded horses
-P-A-G-E-108
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 103 
and dogs and his political interests. Lewis stayed 
at his side, partly to restrain him from outbreaks 
of temper or other acts that might injure his in- 
terests, partly to serve as an intermediary between 
him and the Washington manipulators. 
Before Adams had been in the White House six 
months the country was divided substantially into 
Jackson men and anti-Jackson or administration 
men. The elements from which Jackson drew sup- 
port were many and discordant. The backbone 
of his strength was the self-assertive, ambitious 
western Democracy, which recognized in him its 
truest and most eminent representative. The al- 
liance with the Calhoun forces was kept up, al- 
though it was already jeopardized by the feeling 
of the South Carolinian’s friends that they, and 
not Jackson’s friends, should lead in the coming 
campaign. After a good deal of hesitation the 
supporters of Crawford came over also. VanBuren 
coquetted with the Adams forces for a year, and 
the old-line Republicans, strong in the Jefferso- 
nian faith, brought themselves to the support of 
the Tennesseean with difficulty; but eventually 
both northern and southern wings of the Craw- 
ford contingent alined themselves against the Ad- 
ministration. The decision of Van Buren brought
-P-A-G-E-109
104 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
into the Jackson ranks a past master in party 
management, “the cleverest politician in a State 
in which the sort of politics that is concerned with 
the securing of elections rather than fighting for 
principles had grown into a science and an art.” 
By 1826 the Jackson forces were welded into a 
substantial party, although for a long time their 
principles involved little more than hostility to 
Adams and enthusiasm for Jackson, and they 
bore no other designation than Jackson men. 
The elements that were left to support the Ad- 
ministration were the followers of Adams and 
Clay. These eventually drew together under the 
name of National Republicans. Their strength, 
however, was limited, for Adams could make no 
appeal to the masses, even in New England; while 
Clay, by contributing to Jackson’s defeat, had 
forfeited much of the popularity that would other- 
wise have been his. 
If the story of Adams’s Administration could 
be told in detail, it would be one long record of 
rancorous warfare between the President and the 
Jacksonian opposition in Congress. Adams, on 
the one hand, held inflexibly to his course, advocat- 
ing policies and recommending measures which he 
knew had not the remotest chance of adoption;
-P-A-G-E-110
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 105 
and, on the other hand, the opposition—which in 
the last two years of the Administration controlled 
the Senate as well as the House of Representatives 
—balked at no act that would humiliate the 
President and make capital for its western idol. 
At the outset the Jacksonians tried to hold up the 
confirmation of Clay. It fell furiously, and quite 
without discrimination, upon the President’s great 
scheme of national improvements, professing to 
see in it evidence of an insatiable desire for 
“concentration.” In the discussion of a proposed 
amendment to the Constitution providing for di- 
rect election of the President by the people it was 
constantly assumed and frequently stated that 
Adams had no moral right to the position which 
he occupied. The President’s decision to send 
delegates to the Panama Congress of 1826 raised 
a storm of acrimonious debate and brought the 
Administration’s enemies into closer unison. To > 
cap the climax, Adams was solemnly charged with 
abuse of the federal patronage, and in the Senate 
six bills for the remedy of the President’s pernicious 
practices were brought in by Benton in a single 
batch! Adams was able and honest, but he got no 
credit from his opponents for these qualities. He, in 
turn, displayed little magnanimity; and in refusing
-P-A-G-E-111
106 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
to shape his policies and methods to meet the con- 
ditions under which he had to work, he fell short 
of the highest statesmanship. 
As election year approached, it became clear 
that the people would at last have an opportunity 
to make a direct choice between Adams and Jack- 
son. Each candidate was formally nominated by 
sundry legislatures and other bodies; no one so 
much as suggested nomination by congressional 
caucus. In the early months of 1828 the campaign 
rapidly rose to an extraordinary level of vigor and 
public interest. Each party group became bitter 
and personal in its attacks upon the other; in our 
entire political history there have been not more 
than two or three campaigns so smirched with 
vituperation and abuse. The Jackson papers 
and stump speakers laid great stress on Adams’s 
aristocratic temperament, denounced his policies 
as President, and exploited the “corrupt bargain”’ 
charge with all possible ingenuity. 
On the other hand, the Adams-Clay forces 
dragged forth in long array Jackson’s quarrels, 
duels, and rough-and-tumble encounters to prove 
that he was not fit to be President; they distrib- 
uted handbills decorated with coffins bearing the 
names of the candidate’s victims; they cited scores
-P-A-G-E-112
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 107 
of actions, from the execution of mutinous militia- 
men in the Creek War to the quarrel with Callava, 
to show his arbitrary disposition; and they strove 
in a most malicious manner to undermine his popu- 
larity by breaking down his personal reputation, 
and even that of his wife and of his mother. It 
has been said that ‘“‘the reader of old newspaper 
files and pamphlet collections of the Adamsite 
persuasion, in the absence of other knowledge, 
would gather that Jackson was a usurper, an 
adulterer, a gambler, a cock-fighter, a brawler, a 
drunkard, and withal a murderer of the most cruel 
and blood-thirsty description.” Issues — tariff, in- 
ternal improvements, foreign policy, slavery — re- 
ceded into the background; the campaign became 
for all practical purposes a personal contest between 
the Tennessee soldier and the two statesmen whom 
he accused of bargain and corruption. ‘Hurrah for 
Jackson!” 
of the masses bent on the Tennesseean’s election. 
Jackson never wearied of saying that he was 
“no politician.” He was, none the less, one of the 
most forceful and successful politicians that the 
country has known. He was fortunate.in being 
able to personify a cause which was grounded 
deeply in the feelings and opinions of the people, was the beginning and end of the creed
-P-A-G-E-113
108 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
and also in being able to command the services of a 
large group of tireless and skillful national and local 
managers. He was willing to leave to these man- 
agers the infinite details of his campaign. But he 
kept in close touch with them and their subordi- 
nates, and upon occasion he did not hesitate to 
take personal command. In politics, as in war, 
he was imperious; persons not willing to support 
him with all their might, and without question 
or quibble, he preferred to see on the other side. 
Throughout the campaign his opponents hoped, 
and his friends feared, that he would commit some 
deed of anger that would ruin his chances of elec- 
tion. The temptation was strong, especially when 
the circumstances of his marriage were dragged 
into the controversy. But while he chafed in- 
wardly, and sometimes expressed himself with 
more force than elegance in the presence of his 
friends, he maintained an outward calm and dig- 
nity. His bitterest feeling was reserved for Clay, 
who was known to be the chief inspirer of the Na- 
tional Republicans’ mud-slinging campaign. But 
he felt that Adams had it in his power to put a 
stop to the slanders that were set in circulation, 
had he cared to do so. 
As the campaign drew to a close, circumstances
-P-A-G-E-114
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 109 
pointed with increasing sureness to the triumph 
of the Jackson forces. Adams, foreseeing the end, 
found solace in harsh and sometimes picturesque 
entries in his diary. A group of opposition Con- 
gressmen he pronounced “skunks of party slander.”’ 
Calhoun he described as “stimulated to frenzy 
by success, flattery, and premature advancement; 
governed by no steady principle, but sagacious 
to seize upon every prevailing popular breeze to 
swell his own sails.’ Clay, likewise, became petu- 
lant and gloomy. In the last two months of the 
canvass Jackson ordered a general onslaught upon 
Kentucky, and when finally it was affirmed that 
the State had been “‘carried out from under” its 
accustomed master, Clay knew only too well that 
the boast was true. To Adams’s assurances that 
after four years of Jackson the country would 
gladly turn to the Kentuckian, the latter could 
only reply that there would, indeed, be a reaction, 
but that before another President would be taken 
from the West he would be too old; and it was 
with difficulty that Adams persuaded him not to 
retire immediately from the Cabinet. 
The results of the contest fully bore out the 
apprehensions of the Administration. Jackson 
received nearly 140.000 more popular votes than
-P-A-G-E-115
110 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Adams and carried every State south of the 
Potomac and west of the Alleghanies. He car- 
ried Pennsylvania also by a vote of two to one 
and divided about equally with his opponent the 
votes of New York and Maryland. Only New 
England held fast for Adams. As one writer has 
facetiously remarked, “It took a New England 
conscience to hold a follower in line for the New 
England candidate.” The total electoral vote was 
178 for Jackson and 83 for Adams. Calhoun 
was easily reélected to the vice presidency. Both 
branches of Congress remained under the control 
of Jackson’s partizans. 
Months before the election, congratulatory mes- 
sages began to pour into the Hermitage. Some 
came from old friends and disinterested well- 
wishers, many from prospective seekers of office 
or of other favors. Influential people in the East, 
and especially at the capital, hastened to express 
their desire to be of service to the Jacksons in the 
new life to which they were about to be called. 
In the list one notes with interest the names 
of General Thomas Cadwalader of Philadelphia, 
salaried lobbyist for the United States Bank, 
and Senator Robert Y. Hayne, the future South 
Carolina nullifier.
-P-A-G-E-116
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH 111 
Returns sufficiently complete to leave no doubt 
of Jackson’s election reached the Hermitage on the 
9th of December. That afternoon, Lewis, Carroll, 
and a few other members of the “general head- 
quarters staff” gathered at the Jackson home to 
review the situation and look over the bulky cor- 
respondence that had come in. ‘General Jack- 
son,” reports Lewis, “showed no elation. In fact, 
he had for some time considered his election certain, 
the only question in his mind being the extent of 
the majority. When he finished looking over the 
summary by States, his only remark was that 
Isaac Hill, considering the odds against him, had 
done wonders in New Hampshire!” 
When, two weeks later, the final returns were 
received, leading Tennesseeans decided to give a 
reception, hanquet, and ball which would outshine 
any social occasion in the annals of the Southwest. 
Just as arrangements were completed, however, 
Mrs. Jackson, who had long been in failing health, 
suffered an attack of heart trouble; and at the very 
hour when the General was to have been received, 
amid all the trappings of civil and military splen- 
dor, with the huzzas of his neighbors, friends, and 
admirers, he was sitting tearless, speechless, and 
almost expressionless by the corpse of his life
-P-A-G-E-117
112 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
companion. Long after the beloved one had been 
laid to rest in the Hermitage garden amid the 
rosebushes she had planted, the President-elect 
continued as one benumbed. He never gave up 
the idea that his wife had been killed by worry 
over the attacks made upon him and upon her by 
the Adams newspapers — that, as he expressed 
it, she was “murdered by slanders that pierced 
her heart.” Only under continued prodding from 
Lewis and other friends did he recall himself to his 
great task and set about preparing for the arduous 
winter journey to Washington, composing his in- 
augural address, selecting his Cabinet, and laying 
plans for the reorganization of the federal Civil 
Service on lines already definitely in his mind.
-P-A-G-E-118
CHAPTER VI 
THE “‘REIGN”’ BEGINS 
Jackson’s election to the presidency in 1828 
was correctly described by Senator Benton as “a 
triumph of democratic principle, and an assertion 
of the people’s right to govern themselves.” Jef- 
ferson in his day was a candidate of the masses, 
and his triumph over John Adams in 1800 was 
received with great public acclaim. Yet the Vir- 
ginian was at best an aristocratic sort of demo- 
crat; he was never in the fullest sense a man of the 
people. Neither Madison nor Monroe inspired 
enthusiasm, and for John Quincy Adams even New 
Englanders voted, as Ezekiel Webster confessed, 
from a cold sense of duty. Jackson was, as no 
President before him, the choice of the masses. 
His popular vote in 1824 revealed not only his 
personal popularity but the growing power of the 
democratic elements in the nation, and his defeat 
in the House of Representatives only strengthened 
2 118
-P-A-G-E-119
114 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
his own and the people’s determination to be finally 
victorious. The untrained, self-willed, passionate 
frontier soldier came to power in 1828 as the 
standard bearer of a mighty democratic uprising 
which was destined before it ran its course to break 
down oligarchical party organizations, to liberalize 
state and local governments, and to turn the stream 
of national politics into wholly new channels. 
It was futile for men of the old school to protest 
and to prophesy misfortune for the country under 
its new rulers. The people had spoken, and this 
time the people’s will was not to be denied. 
Still haggard from his recent personal loss, the 
President-elect set out for Washington, at the 
middle of January, 1829. With him went his 
nephew, Andrew Jackson Donelson, who was to 
be his private secretary; Mrs. Donelson, who was 
to preside over the executive mansion; an accom- 
plished niece of Mrs. Jackson, who was to be of 
social assistance; an artist by the name of Earl, 
who resided at the White House throughout Jack- 
son’s two Administrations, engaged continually in 
painting portraits of the General; and, finally, 
the faithful Major Lewis, whose intention was 
merely to attend the inauguration and then return 
to his plantation. The puffing little steamboat
-P-A-G-E-120
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 115 
on which the party traveled down the Cumber- 
land and up the Ohio was saluted and cheered 
a hundred times a day; at Louisville, Cincinnati, 
and Pittsburgh there were great outpourings of 
demonstrative citizens. Duff Green, one of the 
party managers, proposed that a great cavalcade 
should meet the victor at Pittsburgh and escort him 
by relays to the capital. On Van Buren’s advice 
the plan was abandoned. But as the party passed 
along the National Road toward its destination it 
was accorded an ovation which left nothing to be 
desired as an evidence of the public favor. 
Arrived in Washington, on the 11th of Febru- 
ary — the day on which the electoral votes were 
counted in the Senate — Jackson and his friends 
found temporary lodgings at the Indian Queen Tav- 
ern, commonly known as “the Wigwam.” Dur- 
ing the next three weeks the old inn was the 
scene of unwonted activity. Office seekers be- 
sieged it morning, noon, and night; politicians 
came to ask favors or give advice; exponents of 
every sort of cause watched for opportunities to 
obtain promises of presidential support; scores of 
the curious came with no other purpose than to see 
what a backwoods President looked like. ‘“‘The 
city is full of speculation and speculators,” wrote
-P-A-G-E-121
116 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Daniel Webster to his sister-in-law a few days 
after Jackson’s arrival; “a great multitude, too 
many to be fed without a miracle, are already in 
the city, hungry for office. Especially, I learn 
that the typographical corps is assembled in great 
force. From New Hampshire, our friend Hill; 
from Boston, Mr. Greene . . . and from every- 
where else somebody else. So many friends ready 
to advise, and whose advice is so disinterested, 
make somewhat of a numerous council about the 
President-elect; and, if report be true, it is a 
council which only makes that darker which was 
dark enough before.” 
To all, Jackson was accessible. But he was 
not communicative, and up to Inauguration Day 
people were left to speculate not only upon the 
truth of the rumor that there was to be a “full 
sweep” in the offices but upon the new Adminis- 
tration’s attitude on public questions in general. 
Even Isaac Hill, a warm friend and supporter, was 
obliged to write to an acquaintance four days be- 
fore the inauguration that Jackson had little to 
say about the future, “except in a general way.” 
The men with whom the Executive-elect was daily 
closeted were Major Lewis and Senators Eaton 
and White. Van Buren would have been of the
-P-A-G-E-122

number, had not his recently assumed duties as 
Governor kept him at Albany. He was ably rep- 
resented, however, by James A. Hamilton, a son 
of Alexander Hamilton, to whose correspondence 
we owe most of what we know about the laying 
of the plans for the new Administration. 
The most pressing question was the personnel 
of the Cabinet. Upon only one appointment was 
Jackson fully determined when he reached Wash- 
ington: Van Buren was to be Secretary of State. 
The “‘little magician” had been influential in 
turning New York from Crawford to Jackson; he 
had resigned his seat in the Senate and run for the 
governorship with a view to uniting the party for 
Jackson’s benefit; he was the cleverest politician 
and, next to Calhoun, the ablest man, in the 
Democratic ranks. When offered the chief place 
in the Cabinet he promptly accepted. Edward 
Livingston was given his choice of the remaining 
positions, but preferred to accept an election to 
the Senate. With due regard for personal sus- 
ceptibilities and sectional interests, the list was 
then completed. A Pennsylvania Congressman, 
Samuel D. Ingham, became Secretary of the Treas- 
ury; Senator John H. Eaton was made Secre- 
tary of War; a Calhoun supporter from North
-P-A-G-E-123
118 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Carolina, John Branch, was given the Navy port- 
folio; Senator John M. Berrien of Georgia became 
Attorney-General; and William T. Barry of Ken- 
tucky was appointed Postmaster-General, after the 
incumbent, John McLean, refused to accept the 
policy of a clean slate in the department. The 
appointments were kept secret until one week be- 
fore the inauguration, when they were announced 
in the party organ at the capital, Duff Green’s 
United States Telegraph. 
Everywhere the list caused consternation. Van 
Buren’s was the only name of distinction in it; 
and only one of the appointees had had experience 
in the administration of national affairs. Hamil- 
ton pronounced the group “the most unintellec- 
tual Cabinet we ever had.” Van Buren doubted 
whether he ought to have accepted a seat in such 
company. A crowning expression of dissatisfaction 
came from the Tennessee delegation in Congress, 
which formally protested against the appointment 
of Eaton. But the President-elect was not to 
be swayed. His ideas of administrative efficiency 
were not highly developed, and he believed that 
his Cabinet would prove equal to all demands 
made upon it. Not the least of its virtues in his 
eyes was the fact that, although nearly evenly
-P-A-G-E-124
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 119 
divided between his own followers and the friends 
of Calhoun, it contained not one person who was 
not an uncompromising anti-Clay man. 
Meanwhile a motley army of office seekers, per- 
sonal friends, and sightseers — to the number of 
ten or fifteen thousand — poured into Washing. 
ton to see the old régime of Virginia, New York, 
and Massachusetts go out and the new régime of 
the people come in. “A monstrous crowd of peo- 
ple,”” wrote Webster on Inauguration Day, “‘is 
jn the city. I never saw anything like it before. 
Persons have come five hundred miles to see 
General Jackson, and they really seem to think 
that the country is rescued from some dreadful 
danger.” Another observer, who was also not a 
Jacksonian, wrote’: 
No one who was in Washington at the time of General 
Jackson’s inauguration is likely to forget that period to 
the day of his death. To us, who had witnessed the 
quiet and orderly period of the Adams Administration, 
it seemed as if half the nation had rushed at once into 
the capital. It was like the inundation of the northern 
barbarians into Rome, save that the tumultuous tide 
came in from a different point of the compass. The 
West and the South seemed to have precipitated them- 
selves upon the North and overwhelmed it... .

120 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Strange faces filled every public place, and every face 
seemed to bear defiance on its brow. It appeared to me 
that every Jackson editor in the country was on the 
spot. They swarmed, especially in the lobbies of the 
House, an expectant host, a sort of Preetorian band, 
which, having borne in upon their shields their idolized 
leader, claimed the reward of the hard-fought contest. 
The 4th of March dawned clear and balmy. 
“By ten o’clock,” says an eye-witness, ‘‘the Ave- 
nue was crowded with carriages of every descrip- 
tion, from the splendid baronet and coach, down 
to wagons and carts, filled with women and chil- 
dren, some in finery and some in rags, for it 
was the People’s president.”” The great square 
which now separates the Capitol and the Library 
of Congress was in Jackson’s day shut in by a 
picket fence. This enclosure was filled with 
people — “‘a vast agitated sea”’— while in all 
directions the slopes of Capitol Hill were thickly 
occupied. At noon watchers on the west portico, 
looking down Pennsylvania Avenue, saw a group 
of gentlemen issue from the Indian Queen and 
thread its way slowly up the hill. All wore their 
hats except one tall, dignified, white-haired figure 
in the middle, who was quickly recognized as 
Jackson. Passing through the building, the party, 
reinforced by Chief Justice Marshall and certain
-P-A-G-E-126
THE “REIGN ” BEGINS 121 
other dignitaries, emerged upon the east portico, 
amid the deafening cheers of the spectators. The 
President-elect bowed gravely, and, stepping for- 
ward to a small cloth-covered table, read in a low 
voice the inaugural address; the aged Chief Justice, 
“whose life was a protest against the political views 
of the Jackson party,” administered the oath of 
office; and the ceremony was brought to a close in 
the customary manner by the new Executive kiss- 
ing the Bible. Francis Scott Key, watching the 
scene from one of the gates, was moved to exclaim: 
“Tt is beautiful, it is sublime.” 
Thus far the people had been sufficiently im- 
pressed by the dignity of the occasion to keep 
their places and preserve a reasonable silence. 
But when the executive party started to withdraw, 
men, women, and children rushed past the police 
and scrambled up the steps in a wild effort to 
reach their adored leader and grasp his hand. 
Disheveled and panting, the President finally 
reached a gate at which his horse was in waiting; 
and, mounting with difficulty, he set off for the 
White House, followed by a promiscuous multi- 
tude, “countrymen, farmers, gentlemen, mounted 
and unmounted, boys, women, and children, black 
and white.”
-P-A-G-E-127
122 ‘THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
The late President had no part in the day’s 
proceedings. On arriving in Washington, Jack- 
son had refused to make the usual call of the 
incoming upon the outgoing Executive, mainly 
because he held Adams responsible for the news- 
paper virulence which had caused Mrs. Jackson 
such distress and had possibly shortened her life. 
Deserted by all save his most intimate friends, 
the New Englander faced the last hours of his Ad- 
ministration in bitterness. His diary bears ample 
evidence of his ill-humor and chagrin. On the 
3d of March he took up his residence on Merid- 
ian Hill, near the western limits of the city; 
and thence he did not venture until the festi- 
vities of the ensuing day were ended. No amount 
of effort on the part of mediators ever availed 
to bring about a reconciliation between him and 
his successor. 
According to custom, the inaugural program 
came to an end with a reception at the White 
House; and arrangements were made to entertain 
a large number of guests. Police control, how- 
ever, proved wholly inadequate, and when the 
throng that followed the President up the Avenue 
reached the executive grounds it engulfed the man- 
sion and poured in by windows as well as doors,
-P-A-G-E-128
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 123 
until the reception rooms were packed to suffo- 
cation. Other guests, bidden and unbidden — 
**statesmen and stable-boys, fine ladies and washer- 
women, white people and blacks’’ — continued for 
hours to besiege the doors. ‘I never saw such a 
mixture,” records Judge Story; “the reign of King 
Mob seemed triumphant. I was glad to escape 
from the scene as soon as possible.” The Presi- 
dent, too, after being jostled for an hour, very will- 
ingly made his way by a side entrance to the street 
and thence to his hotel. 
A profusion of refreshments, including barrels of 
orange punch, had been provided; and an attempt 
to serve the guests led to a veritable saturnalia. 
Waiters emerging from doors with loaded trays 
were borne to the floor by the crush; china and 
glassware were smashed; gallons of punch were 
spilled on the carpets; in their eagerness to be 
served men in muddy boots leaped upon damask- 
covered chairs, overturned tables, and brushed 
bric-a-brac from mantles and walls. “It would 
have done Mr. Wilberforce’s heart good,” writes 
a cynical observer, “to have seen a stout black 
wench eating in this free country a jelly with a 
gold spoon at the President’s House.” Only when 
some thoughtful person directed that tubs of
-P-A-G-E-129
1% THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
punch be placed here and there on the lawn was 
the congestion indoors relieved. When it was all 
over, the White House resembled a pigsty. “‘Sev- 
eral thousand dollars’ worth of broken china and 
cut glass and many bleeding noses attested the 
fierceness of the struggle.” It was the people’s 
day, and it was of no avail for fastidious Adams- 
ites to lift their eyebrows in ridicule or scorn. 
Those in whom the establishment of the new 
order aroused keenest apprehension were the 
officeholders. A favorite theme of the Jackson 
forces during the late campaign was the abuses 
of the patronage, and the General came into office 
fully convinced that an overhauling of the civil 
service would be one of the greatest contributions 
that he could make to his country’s welfare. Even 
if he had been less sure of this than he was, 
the pressure which office seekers and their friends 
brought to bear upon him would have been ir- 
resistible. Four-fifths of the people who flocked 
to Washington at inauguration time were seekers 
after office for themselves or their friends, and 
from every county and town the country over 
came pleas of service rendered and claims for 
reward. But Jackson needed little urging. He 
thought, and rightly, that many of the incumbents
-P-A-G-E-130
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 125 
had grown lax in the performance of their duties, 
if indeed they had ever been anything else, and 
that fresh blood was needed in the government 
employ. He believed that short terms and rapid 
rotation made for alertness and efficiency. He 
felt that one man had as much right to public 
office as another, and he was so unacquainted with 
the tasks of administration as to suppose all honest 
citizens equally capable of serving their fellowmen 
in public station. As for the grievances of persons 
removed, his view was that ‘“‘no individual wrong 
is done by removal, since neither appointment to 
nor continuance in office is a matter of right.” 
Shortly after the election Major Lewis wrote to 
a friend that the General was “resolved on making 
a pretty clean sweep of the departments.” It is 
expected, he added, that “he will cleanse the 
Augean stables, and I feel pretty confident that 
he will not disappoint the popular expectation in 
this particular.” If a complete overturn was ever 
really contemplated, the plan was not followed 
up; and it is more than possible that it was Van 
Buren who marked off the limits beyond which it 
would not be expedient to go. None the less, 
Jackson’s removals far exceeded those made by 
his predecessors. Speaking broadly, the power of
-P-A-G-E-131
126 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
removal had never yet been exercised in the Feder- 
al Government with offensive partizanship. Even 
under Jefferson, when the holders of half of the 
offices were changed in the space of four years, 
there were few removals for political reasons. 
No sooner was Jackson in office, however, than 
wholesale proscription began. The ax fell in 
every department and bureau, and cut off chiefs 
and clerks with equal lack of mercy. Age and 
experience counted rather against a man than in 
his favor, and rarely was any reason given for 
removal other than that some one else wanted 
the place. When Congress met, in December, it 
was estimated that a thousand persons had been 
ousted; and during the first year of the Adminis- 
tration the number is said to have reached two 
thousand. The Post-Office Department and the 
Customs Service were purged with special severity. 
The sole principle on which the new appointees 
were selected was loyalty to Jackson. Practically 
all were inexperienced, most were incompetent, 
and several proved dishonest 
“There has been,” wrote the President in his 
‘journal a few weeks after the inauguration, “a 
great noise made about removals.”” Protest srose 
not only from the proscribed and their friends, but
-P-A-G-E-132
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 127 
from the Adams-Clay forces generally, and even 
from some of the more moderate Jacksonians, 
“Were it not for the outdoor popularity of General 
Jackson,” wrote Webster, ‘‘the Senate would have 
negatived more than half his nominations.” As it 
was, many were rejected; and some of the worst 
were, under pressure, withdrawn. On the general 
principle the President held his ground. “It ig 
rotation in office,” he again and again asserted 
in all honesty, “that will perpetuate our liberty,” 
and from this conviction no amount of argument 
or painful experience could shake him. After 1830 
one hears less about the subject, but only be- 
cause the novelty and glamor of the new régime 
had worn off. 
Jackson was not the author of the spoils system. 
The device of using the offices as rewards for 
political service had long been familiar in the 
state and local governments, notably in New York. 
What Jackson and his friends did was simply to 
carry over the spoils principle into the National 
Government. No more unfortunate step was ever 
taken by an American President; the task of un- 
doing the mischief has been long and laborious. 
Yet the spoils system was probably an inevitable 
feature of the new rule of the people; at all events,
-P-A-G-E-133
128 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
it was accepted by all parties and sanctioned by 
public sentiment for more than half a century. 
Like Philip II of Spain, who worked twelve 
hours a day at the business of being a King, Jack- 
son took the duties of his exalted post very seri- 
ously. No man had ever accused him of laxness in 
public office, civil or military; on the contrary, his 
superiors commonly considered themselves fortu- 
nate if they could induce or compel him to keep 
his energies within reasonable bounds. As Presi- 
dent he was not without distressing shortcomings. 
He was self-willed, prejudiced, credulous, petulant. 
But he was honest, and he was industrious. No 
President ever kept a closer watch upon Congress 
to see that the rights of the executive were not 
invaded or the will of the people thwarted; and 
his vigilance was rewarded, not only by his success 
in vindicating the independence of the executive 
in a conflict whose effects are felt to this day, but 
by the very respectable amount of legislation 
which he contrived to obtain in the furtherance 
of what he believed to be the public welfare. 
When a rebellious Congress took the bit in its 
teeth, he never hesitated to crack the whip over 
its head. Sometimes the pressure was applied 
indirectly, but with none the less effect. One of
-P-A-G-E-134
THE “REIGN” BEGINS 129 
the first acts of the Senate to arouse strong feelings 
in the White House was the rejection of the nomi- 
nation of Isaac Hill to be Second Comptroller of 
the Treasury. A New Hampshire senatorship soon 
falling vacant, the President deftly brought about 
the election of Hill to the position; and many a 
gala hour he had in later days as Lewis and other 
witnesses described the chagrin of the senators at 
being obliged to accept as one of their colleagues 
a man whom they had adjudged unfit for a less 
important office. 
Much thought had been bestowed upon the com- 
position of the Cabinet, and some of the Presi- 
dent’s warmest supporters urged that he should 
make use of the group as a council of state, after 
the manner of his predecessors. Jackson’s pur- 
poses, however, ran in a different direction. He 
had been on intimate terms with fewer than half 
of the members, and he saw no reason why these 
men, some of whom were primarily the friends of 
Calhoun, should be allowed to supplant old con- 
fidants like Lewis. Let them, he reasoned, go 
about their appointed tasks as heads of the admin- 
istrative departments, while he looked for counsel 
whithersoever he desired. Hence the official 
Cabinet fell into the background, and after a °
-P-A-G-E-135
130 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
few weeks the practice of holding meetings was 
dropped. 
As advisers on party affairs and on matters of 
general policy the President drew about himself 
a heterogeneous group of men which the public 
labeled the “Kitchen Cabinet.” Included in the 
number were the two members of the regular Cabi- 
net in whom Jackson had implicit confidence, Van 
Buren and Eaton. Isaac Hill was a member. 
Amos Kendall, a New Englander who had lately 
edited a Jackson paper in Kentucky, and who now 
found his reward in the fourth auditorship of the 
Treasury, was another. William B. Lewis, pre- 
vailed upon by Jackson to accept another auditor- 
ship along with Kendall, rather than to follow out 
his original intention to return to his Tennessee 
plantation, was not only in the Kitchen Cabinet 
but was also a member of the President’s household. 
Duff Green, editor of the Telegraph, and A. J. 
Donelson, the President’s nephew and secretary, 
were included in the group; as was also Francis 
P. Blair after, in 1830, he became editor of the 
new administration organ, the Globe. It was the 
popular impression that the influence of these 
men, especially of Lewis and Kendall, was very 
great — that, indeed, they virtually ruled the
-P-A-G-E-136
THE “REIGN * BEGINS isi 
country. There was some truth in the supposi- 
tion. In matters upon which his mind was not: 
fully made up, Jackson was easily swayed; and his’ 
most intimate “‘Kitchen” advisers were adepts at 
playing upon his likes and dislikes. He, however, 
always resented the insinuation that he was not 
his own master, and all testimony goes to show that 
when he was once resolved upon a given course 
his friends were just as powerless to stop him as 
were his enemies. 
The Jacksonians were carried into office on a 
great wave of popular enthusiasm, and for the 
time being all the powers of government were 
theirs. None the less, their position was imperiled 
almost from the beginning by a breach within the 
administration ranks. Calhoun had contented 
himself with reélection to the vice presidency in 
1828 on the understanding that, after Jackson 
should have had one term, the road to the White 
House would be left clear for himself. Probably 
Jackson, when elected, fully expected Calhoun to 
be his successor. Before long, however, the South 
Carolinian was given ground for apprehension. 
Men began to talk about a second term for Jack- 
son, and the White House gave no indication of dis- 
approval. Even more disconcerting was the large
-P-A-G-E-137
132 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
place taken in the new régime by Van Buren. The 
“little magician” held the chief post in the Cabi- 
net; he was in the confidence of the President as 
Calhoun was not; there were multiplying indica- 
tions that he was aiming at the presidency; and 
if he were to enter the race he would be hard to 
beat, for by general admission he was the coun- 
try’s most astute politician. With every month 
that passed the Vice President’s star was in graver 
danger of eclipse. 
Several curious circumstances worked together 
to widen the breach between the Calhoun and 
Van Buren elements and at the same time to 
bring the President definitely into the ranks of 
the New Yorker’s supporters. One was the con- 
troversy over the social status of “Peggy” Eaton. 
Peggy was the daughter of a tavern keeper, William 
O’Neil, at whose hostelry both Jackson and Eaten 
had lived when they were senators. Her first hus- 
band, a purser in the navy, committed suicide 
at sea; and Washington gossips said that he was 
driven to the act by chagrin caused by his wife’s 
misconduct, both before and after her marriage. 
On the eve of Jackson’s inauguration the widow 
became Mrs. Eaton, and certain disagreeable ru 
mors connecting the names of the two were con-
-P-A-G-E-138
THE “REIGN ” BEGINS 133 
firmed in the public mind. When Eaton was made 
Secretary of War, society shrugged its shoulders 
and wondered what sort of figure “Peg O’Neil” 
would cut in Cabinet circles. The question was 
soon answered. At the first official functions 
Mrs. Eaton was received with studied neglect by 
the wives of the other Cabinet officers; and all 
refused either to call on her or to receive her in 
their homes. 
Jackson was furious. It was enough for him 
that Mrs. Jackson had thought weil of the sus- 
pected woman, and all his gallantry rose in her 
defense. Professing to regard the attitude of the 
protesters as nothing less than an affront to his 
Administration, he called upon the men of the 
Cabinet, and upon the Vice President, to remon- 
strate with their wives in Mrs. Eaton’s behalf. 
But if any such remonstrances were made, nothing 
cameofthem. “For once in his life, Andrew Jack- 
son was defeated. Creeks and Spaniards and Red- 
coats he could conquer, but the ladies of Washington 
never surrendered, and Peggy Eaton, though her 
affairs became a national question, never got into 
Washington society.” The political effect of 
the episode was considerable. Van Buren was 
1 Brown, Andrew Jackson, p. 127.
-P-A-G-E-139
134 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
a widower, and, having no family to object, he 
showed Mrs. Eaton all possible courtesy. On the 
other hand, Mrs. Calhoun was the leader of those 
who refused Mrs. Eaton recognition. Jackson was 
not slow to note these facts, and his opinion of Van 
Buren steadily rose, while he set down Calhoun as 
an obdurate member of the “conspiracy.” 
Throughout the winter of 1829-30 the Calhoun 
and Van Buren factions kept up a contest which 
daily became more acrimonious and open. Al- 
ready the clique around the President had secretly 
decided that in 1832 he must run again, with Van 
Buren as a mate, and that the New Yorker should 
be the presidential candidate in 1836. Though 
irritated by the Vice President’s conduct in the 
Eaton affair and in other matters, Jackson threw 
over the understanding of 1828 with reluctance. 
Even when, on the last day of 1829, his friends, 
alarmed by the state of his health, persuaded him, 
to write a letter to a Tennessee judge warmly com- 
mending Van Buren and expressing grave doubts 
about the South Carolinian — a statement which, 
in the event of worst fears being realized, would be 
of the utmost value to the Van Buren men — he 
was unwilling to go the full length of an open break. 
But Lewis and his coworkers were craftily laying
-P-A-G-E-140
THE “REIGN ” BEGINS 135 
the train of powder that would lead to an explosion, 
and in the spring of 1830 they were ready to apply 
the match. When the President had been worked 
up to the right stage of suspicion, it was suddenly 
made known to him that it was Calhoun, not Craw- 
ford, who in Monroe’s Cabinet circle in 1818 
had urged that the conqueror of Florida be cen- 
sured for his bold deeds. This had the full effect 
desired. Jackson made a peremptory demand 
upon the Vice President for an explanation of his 
perfidy. Calhoun responded in a letter which ex- 
plained and explained, yet got nowhere. Where- 
upon Jackson replied in a haughty communication, 
manifestly prepared by the men who were engineer- 
ing the whole business, declaring the former Sec- 
retary guilty of the most reprehensible duplicity 
and severing all relations with him. This meant 
the end of Calhoun’s hopes, at all events for the 
present. He could never be President while Jack- 
son’s influence lasted. Van Buren had won; and 
the embittered South Carolinian could only turn for 
solace to the nullification movement, in which he 
was already deeply engulfed. 
Pursuing their plans to the final stroke, the 
Administration managers forced a reconstruction 
of the Cabinet, and all of Calhoun’s supporters
-P-A-G-E-141
1386 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
were displaced. Louis McLane of Delaware be- 
came Secretary of the Treasury; Lewis Cass of 
Michigan, Secretary of War; Levi Woodbury of 
New Hampshire, Secretary of the Navy; and Roger 
B. Taney of Maryland, Attorney-General. Van 
Buren also retired, in conformity with Jackson’s 
announced intention not to have any one in the 
Cabinet who was a candidate for the succession; 
and Edward Livingston, Jackson’s old Louisiana 
friend, became Secretary of State. 
It was decided that a fitting post for a successor 
while awaiting his turn — particularly for one who 
was not popular — would be the ministership to 
Great Britain; and Van Buren duly traveled to 
London to take up the duties of this position. But 
when the appointment was submitted to the Sen- 
ate, Calhoun’s friends adroitly managed matters so 
that the Vice President should have the satisfac- 
tion of preventing confirmation by his casting vote. 
“Tt will kill him, sir, kill him dead,’’ declared the 
vengeful South Carolinian to a doubting friend. 
“He will never kick, sir, never kick.” But no 
greater tactical error could have been committed. 
Benton showed the keener insight when he in- 
formed the jubilant Calhoun men that they had 
‘broken a minister,” only to elect a Vice President.

CHAPTER VII 
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 
TuE United States came out of her second war with 
Great Britain a proud and fearless nation, though 
her record was not, on its face, glorious. She went 
to war shockingly unprepared; the people were of 
divided opinion, and one great section was in open. 
revolt; the military leaders were without distinc- 
tion; the soldiery was poorly trained and equipped; 
finances were disordered; the operations on land: 
were mostly failures; and the privateers, which 
achieved wonders in the early stages of the contest, 
were driven to cover long before the close; for the 
restoration of peace the nation had to thank Eng- 
land’s war weariness far more than her own suc- 
cesses; and the Treaty of Ghent did not so much as 
mention impressment, captures, or any of the other 
matters mainly at issue when the war was begun. 
Peace, however, brought gratitude, enthusiasm, 
optimism. Defeats were quickly forgotten; and 
137
-P-A-G-E-143
138 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Jackson’s victory at New Orleans atoned for the 
humiliations of years. After all, the contest had 
been victorious in its larger outcome, for the new 
world conditions were such as to insure that the 
claims and practices which had troubled the re- 
lations of the United States and Great Britain 
would never be revived. The carpings of critics 
were drowned in the public rejoicings. The Hart~ 
ford Convention dissolved unwept and unsung. 
Flushed with pride and confidence, the country 
entered upon a new and richer epoch. 
The dominant tone of this dawning period was 
nationalism. The nation was to be made great 
and rich and free; sectional interests and ambi- 
tions were to be merged in the greater national 
purpose. Congress voiced the sentiment of the 
day by freely laying tariffs to protect newly risen 
manufactures, by appropriating money for “in- 
ternal improvements,” by establishing a second 
United States Bank, and by giving full support 
to the annexation of territory for the adjustment 
of border difficulties and the extension of the coun- 
try to its natural frontiers. 
Under the leadership of John Marshall, the 
Supreme Court handed down an imposing series of 
decisions restricting the powers of the States and

throwing open the floodgates for the expansion of 
national functions and activities. Statesmen of all 
sections put the nation first in their plans and 
policies as they had not always done in earlier days. 
John C. Calhoun was destined shortly to take rank 
as the greatest of sectionalists. Nevertheless, be- 
tween 1815 and 1820 he voted for protective tariffs, 
brought in a great bill for internal improvements, 
and won from John Quincy Adams praise for being 
“above all sectional . . . prejudices more than any 
other statesman of this union” with whom he 
“had ever acted.” 
The differences between the nationalist and 
state rights schools were, however, deep-rooted — 
altogether too fundamental to be obliterated by 
even the nationalizing swing of the war period; and 
in a brief time the old controversy of Hamilton and 
Jefferson was renewed on the former lines. The 
pull of political tradition and of sectional inter- 
est was too strong to be resisted. In the commer- 
cial and industrial East tradition and interest 
supported, in general, the doctrine of broad na- 
tional powers; and the same was true of the West 
and Northwest. The South, however, inclined to 
limited national powers, large functions for the 
States, and such a construction of the Constitution
-P-A-G-E-145
1440 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
as would give the benefit of the doubt in all cases 
to the States. 
The political theory current south of the Po- 
tomac and the Ohio made of state rights a fe- 
tish. Yet the powerful sectional reaction which 
set in after 1820 against the nationalizing tend- 
ency had as its main impetus the injustice which 
the Southern people felt had been done to them 
through the use of the nation’s larger powers. 
They objected to the protective tariff as a device 
which not only brought the South no benefit but 
interfered with its markets and raised the cost of 
certain of its staple supplies. They opposed in- 
ternal improvements at national expense because 
of their consolidating tendency, and because few 
of the projects carried out were of large advan- 
tage to the Southern people. They regarded the 
National Bank as at best useless; and they re- 
sisted federal legislation imposing restrictions on 
slavery as prejudicial to vested rights in the 
“peculiar institution.” 
After 1820 the pendulum swung rapidly back 
toward particularism. State rights sentiment was 
freely expressed by men, both Southern and North- 
ern, whose views commanded respect; and in more 
than one State — notably in Ohic and Georgia —
-P-A-G-E-146
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 141 
bold actions proclaimed this sentiment to be no 
mere matter of academic opinion. Ohio in 1819 
forcibly collected a tax on the United States Bank 
in defiance of the Supreme Court’s decision in 
the case of M’Culloch vs. Maryland; and in 1821 
her Legislature reaffirmed the doctrines of the Vir- 
ginia and Kentucky resolutions and persisted in re- 
sistance, even after the Supreme Court had ren- 
dered a decision* specifically against the position 
which the State had taken. Judge Roane of 
Virginia, in a series of articles in the Richmond 
Enquirer, argued that the Federal Union was a 
compact among the States and that the national- 
istic reasoning of his fellow Virginian, Marshall, 
in the foregoing decisions was false; and Jefferson 
heartily endorsed his views. In Cohens vs. Vir- 
ginia, in 1821, the Supreme Court held that it had 
appellate jurisdiction in a case decided by a state 
court where the Constitution and laws of the United 
States were involved, even though a State was 
a party; whereupon the Virginia House of Dele- 
gates declared that the State’s lawyers had been 
right in their contention that final construction 
of the Constitution Iay with the courts of the 
States. Jefferson, also, gave this assertion his 
* Osborn vs. Bank of the United States.
-P-A-G-E-147
142 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
support, and denounced the centralizing tenden- 
cies of the Judiciary, “which, working like gravity 
without any intermission, is to press us at last into 
one consolidated mass.” 
In 1825 Jefferson actually proposed that the 
Virginia Legislature should pass a set of resolu- 
tions pronouncing null and void the whole body of 
federal laws on the subject of internal improve- 
ments. The Georgia Legislature, aroused by grow- 
ing antislavery activities in the North, declared 
in 1827 that the remedy lay in “a firm and deter- 
mined union of the people and the States of the 
South” against interference with the institutions 
of that section of the country. Already Georgia 
had placed herself in an attitude of resistance to 
the Federal Government upon the rights of the 
Indians within her borders, and within the next 
decade she repeatedly nullified decisions of the 
federal courts on this subject. In 1828 the South 
Carolina Legislature adopted a series of eight reso- 
lutions denouncing the lately enacted “tariff of 
abominations,” and a report, originally drafted by 
Calhoun and commonly known as The South Caro- 
lina Exposition, in which were to be found all of the 
essentials of the constitutional argument under- 
lying the nullification movement of 1832.
-P-A-G-E-148
1HE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 143 
When Jackson went into the White House, the 
country was therefore fairly buzzing with dis- 
cussions of constitutional questions. What was 
the true character of the Constitution and of the 
Union established under it? Were the States 
sovereign? Who should determine the limits of 
state and federal powers? What remedy had a 
State against unconstitutional measures of the 
National Government? Who should say when an 
act was unconstitutional? 
The South, in particular, was in an irritableframe 
of mind. Agriculture was in a state of depression; 
manufacturing was not developing as had been 
expected; the steadily mounting tariffs were work- 
ing economic disadvantage; the triumph of mem- 
bers of Congress and of the Supreme Court who 
favored a loose construction of the Constitution 
indicated that there would be no end of acts and 
decisions contrary to what the South regarded 
as her own interests. Some apprehensive people 
looked to Jackson for reassurance. But his first 
message to Congress assumed that the tariff would 
continue as it was, and, indeed, gave no promise of 
relief in any direction. 
It was at this juncture that the whole contro- 
versy flared up unexpectedly in one of the greatest
-P-A-G-E-149
144 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
debates ever heard on the floor of our Congress or 
in the legislative halls of any country. On Decem- 
ber 29, 1829, Senator Samuel A. Foote of Con- 
necticut offered an innocent-looking resolution pro- 
posing a temporary restriction of the sale of public 
lands to such lands as had already been placed on 
the market. The suggestion was immediately re- 
sented by western members, who professed to see 
in it a desire to check the drain of eastern popula- 
tion to the West; and upon the reconvening of 
Congress following the Christmas recess Senator 
Benton of Missouri voiced in no uncertain terms 
the indignation of his State and section. The dis- 
cussion might easily have led to nothing more than 
the laying of the resolution on the table; and in that 
event we should never have heard of it. But it 
happened that one of the senators from South 
Carolina, Robert Y. Hayne, saw in the situation 
what he took to be a chance to deliver a telling 
blow for his own discontented section. On the 
19th of January he got the floor, and at the fag- 
end of a long day he held his colleagues’ attention 
for an hour. 
The thing that Hayne had in mind to do prima- 
rily was to draw the West to the side of the South, 
im common opposition to the East. He therefore
-P-A-G-E-150
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 145 
vigorously attacked the Foote resolution, agreeing 
with Benton that it was an expression of Eastern 
jealousy and that its adoption would greatly re- 
tard the development of the West. He laid much 
stress upon the common interests of the Western 
and Southern people and openly invited the one 
to an alliance with the other. He deprecated the 
tendencies of the Federal Government to consoli- 
dation and declared himself “opposed, in any 
shape, to all unnecessary extension of the powers or 
the influence of the Legislature or Executive of the 
Union over the States, or the people of the States.” 
Throughout the speech ran side by side the twin 
ideas of strict construction and state rights; in 
every sentence breathed the protest of South 
Carolina against the protective tariff. 
Just as the South Carolinian began speaking, a 
shadow darkened the doorway of the Senate cham- 
ber, and Daniel Webster stepped casually inside. 
The Massachusetts member was at the time ab- 
sorbed in the preparation of certain cases that were 
coming up before the Supreme Court, and he had 
given little attention either to Foote’s resolution 
or to the debate upon it. What he now heard, 
however, quickly drove Carver’s Lessee vs. John 
Jacob Astor quite out of his mind. Aspersions re
-P-A-G-E-151
146 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
were being cast upon his beloved New England; 
the Constitution was under attack; the Union 
itself was being called in question. Webster’s 
decision was instantaneous: Hayne must be an- 
swered — and answered while his arguments were 
still hot. 
“Seeing the true grounds of the Constitution 
thus attacked,” the New Englander subsequently 
explained at a public dinner in New York, “I 
raised my voice in its favor, I must confess, with 
no preparation or previous intention. I can hardly 
say that I embarked in the contest from a sense of 
duty. It was an instantaneous impulse of inclina- 
tion, not acting against duty, I trust, but hardly 
waiting for its suggestions. I felt it to be a contest 
for the integrity of the Constitution, and I was 
ready to enter into it, not thinking, or caring, per- 
sonally, how I came out.” In a speech charac- 
terized by Henry Cabot Lodge as “one of the most 
effective retorts, one of the strongest pieces of de- 
structive criticism, ever uttered in the Senate,” 
Webster now defended his section against the 
charges of selfishness, jealousy, and snobbishness 
that had been brought against it, and urged that 
the Senate and the people be made to hear no more 
utterances, such as those of Hayne, tending “to
-P-A-G-E-152
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 147 
bring the Union into discussion, as a mere question 
of present and temporary expediency.” 
The debate was now fairly started, and the word 
quickly went round that a battle of the giants was 
impending. Each foeman was worthy of the other’s 
steel. Hayne was representative of all that was 
proudest and best in the South Carolina of his day. 
“Nature had lavished on him,” says Benton, “all 
the gifts which lead to eminence in public, and 
to happiness in private, life.” He was tall, well- 
proportioned, graceful; his features were clean-cut 
and expressive of both intelligence and amiability; 
his manner was cordial and unaffected; his mind 
was vigorous and his industry unremitting. Fur- 
thermore, he was an able lawyer, a fluent orator, 
a persuasive debater, an adroit parliamentarian. 
Upon entering the Senate at the early age of 
thirty-two, he had won prompt recognition by a 
powerful speech in opposition to the tariff of 1824; 
and by 1828, when he was reélected, he was known 
as the South’s ablest and boldest spokesman in the 
upper chamber. 
Webster was an equally fitting representative of 
rugged New England. Born nine years earlier than 
Hayne, he struggled up from a boyhood of physi- 
cal frailty and poverty to an honored place at the
-P-A-G-E-153
1448 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Boston bar, and in 1812, at the age of thirty, was 
elected to Congress. To the Senate he brought, 
in 1827, qualities that gave him at once a pre- 
eminent position. His massive head, beetling 
brow, flashing eye, and stately carriage attracted 
instant attention wherever he went. His physi- 
cal impressiveness was matched by lofty traits of 
character and by extraordinary powers of intel- 
lect; and by 1830 he had acquired a reputation 
for forensic ability and legal acumen which were 
second to none. 
When, therefore, on the 21st of January, Hayne 
rose to deliver his First Reply, and Webster five 
days later took the floor to begin his Second Reply 
— probably the greatest effort in the history of 
American legislative oratory — the little chamber 
then used by the Senate, but nowadays given over 
to the Supreme Court, presented a spectacle fairly 
to be described as historic. Every senator who 
could possibly be present answered at roll call. 
Here were Webster’s more notable fellow New 
Englanders — John Holmes of Maine, Levi Wood- 
bury of New Hampshire, Horatio Seymour of Ver- 
mont. There were Mahlon Dickerson and Theo- 
dore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and John M. 
Clayton of Delaware. Here, John Tyler of Vir-
-P-A-G-E-154
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 149 
ginia, John Forsyth of Georgia, William R. King of 
Alabama; there, Hugh L. White and Felix Grundy 
of Tennessee, and Thomas H. Benton of Missouri. 
From the President’s chair Hayne’s distinguished 
fellow South Carolinian, Calhoun, looked down up- 
on the assemblage with emotions which he vainly 
strove to conceal. 
During the later stages of the discussion people 
of prominence from adjoining States filled the ho- 
tels of the city and bombarded the senators with 
requests for tickets of admission to the senate 
galleries. Lines were formed, and when the doors 
were thrown open in the morning every available 
inch of space was instantly filled with interested 
and excited spectators. So great was the pressure 
that all rules governing the admission of the public 
were waived. On the day of Webster’s greatest 
effort ladies were admitted to the seats of the mem- 
bers, and the throng overflowed through the lob- 
bies and down the long stairways, quite beyond 
hearing distance. In the House of Representa- 
tives the Speaker remained at his post, but the 
attendance was so scant that no business could 
be transacted. 
Hayne’s speech — begun on the 21st and con- 
tinued on the 25th of January — was the fullest and
-P-A-G-E-155
150 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
most forceful exposition of the doctrines of strict 
construction, state rights, and nullification that 
had ever fallen upon the ear of Congress. It was 
no mere piece of abstract argumentation. Hayne 
was not the man to shrink from personalities, and 
he boldly accused the New England Federalists of 
disloyalty and Webster himself of complicity in 
“bargain and corruption.” Thrusting and parry- 
ing, he stirred his supporters to wild enthusiasm 
and moved even the solemn-visaged Vice President 
to smiles of approval. The nationalists winced and 
wondered whether their champion would be able to 
measure up with so keen an antagonist. Webster 
sat staring into space, breaking his reverie only now 
and then to make a few notes. 
The debate reached a climax in Webster’s power- 
ful Second Reply, on the 26th and 27th of January. 
Everything was favorable for a magnificent effort: 
the hearing was brilliant, the theme was vital, the 
speaker was in the prime of his matchless powers. 
On the desk before the New Englander as he arose 
were only five small letter-paper pages of notes. 
He spoke with such immediate preparation merely 
as the labors of a single evening made possible. 
But it may be doubted whether any forensic effort 
in our history was ever more thoroughly prepared
-P-A-G-E-156
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 151 
for, because Webster lived his speech before he 
spoke it. The origins of the Federal Union, the 
theories and applications of the Constitution, the 
history and bearings of nullification — these were 
matters with which years of study, observation, 
professional activity, and association with men 
had made him absolutely familiar. If any living 
American could answer Hayne and his fellow 
partizans, Webster was the man to do it. 
Forty-eight in the total of seventy-three pages of 
print filled by this speech are taken up with a de- 
fense of New England against the Southern charges 
of sectionalism and disloyalty. Few utterances 
of the time are more familiar than the sentences 
bringing this part of the oration to a close: “Mr. 
President, I shall enter on no encomium of Massa- 
chusetts; she needs none. There she is. Behold 
her, and judge for yourselves. There is her history; 
the world knows it by heart... . There is Bos- 
ton, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; 
and there they will remain forever.” If this had 
been all, the speech would have been only a spirited 
defense of the good name of a section and would 
hardly have gained immortality. It was the Union, 
however, that most needed defense; and for that 
service the orator reserved his grandest efforts.
-P-A-G-E-157
152 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
From the opening of the discussion Webster’s 
object had been to “force from Hayne or his sup- 
porters a full, frank, clear-cut statement of what 
nullification meant; and then, by opposing to this 
doctrine the Constitution as he understood it, to 
show its utter inadequacy and fallaciousness either 
as constitutional law or as a practical working 
scheme.”! In the Southerner’s First Reply Web- 
ster found the statement that he wanted; he now 
proceeded to demolish it. Many pages of print 
would be required to reproduce, even in substance, 
the arguments which he employed. Yet the fun- 
damentals are so simple that they can be stated 
in a dozen lines. Sovereignty, under our form of 
government, resides in the people of the United 
States. The exercise of the powers of sovereignty 
is entrusted by the people partly to the National 
Government and partly to the state Governments. 
This division of functions is made in the federal 
Constitution. If differences arise, as they must, as 
to the precise nature of the division, the decision 
rests — not with the state legislatures, as Hayne 
had said -— but with the federal courts, which 
were established in part for that very purpose. 
No State has a right to “nullify” a federal law; 
1 MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, p. 98.
-P-A-G-E-158
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 153 
if one State has this right, all must have it, and the 
result can only be conflicts that would plunge the 
Government into chaos and the people ultimately 
intowar. If the Constitution is not what the people 
want, they can amend it; but as long as it stands, 
the Constitution and all lawful government under 
it must be obeyed. 
The incomparably eloquent peroration pene- 
trated to the heart of the whole matter. The logic 
of nullification was disunion. Fine theories might 
be spun and dazzling phrases made to convince 
men otherwise, but the hard fact would remain. 
Hayne, Calhoun, and their like were playing 
with fire. Already they were boldly weighing “the 
chances of preserving liberty when the bonds that 
unite us together shall be broken asunder”; al- 
ready they were hanging over the precipice of 
disunion, to see whether they could “fathom 
the depth of the abyss below.” The last power- 
ful words of the speech were, therefore, a glovifi- 
eation of the Union: 
While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying 
prospects spread out before us, for us and our children. 
Beyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant 
that in my day, at least, that curtain may not rise. . . . 
When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time
-P-A-G-E-159
154 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the 
broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious 
Union; on States dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on 
a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, 
in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and lingering 
glance, rather, behold the gorgeous ensign of the Repub- 
lic, now known and honored throughout the earth, still 
full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in 
their original lustre, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor 
a single star obscured, bearing for its motto no such 
miserable interrogatory as “What is all this worth?” 
nor those other words of delusion and folly “Liberty 
first and Union afterward”; but everywhere, spread all 
over in characters of living light, blazing on all its ample 
folds, as they float over the sea and over the land, and 
in every wind under the whole heavens, that other senti- 
ment, dear to every American heart — “Liberty and 
Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!” 
Undaunted by the flood of eloquence that for 
four hours held the Senate spellbound, Hayne 
replied in a long speech that touched the zenith 
of his own masterful powers of argumentation. 
He conceded nothing. Each State, he still main- 
tained, is “an independent sovereignty”; the Union 
is based upon a compact; and every party to the 
compact has a right to interpret for itself the 
terms of the agreement by which all are bound to- 
gether. In a short, crisp speech, traversing the 
main ground which he had already gone over.
-P-A-G-E-160
  THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 155 
Webster exposed the inconsistencies and dangers 
involved in this argument; and the debate was 
over. The Foote resolution, long since forgotten, 
remained on the Senate calendar four months and 
was then tabled. Webster went back to his cases; 
the politicians turned again to their immediate 
concerns; the humdrum of congressional busi- 
ness was resumed; and popular interest drifted 
to other things. 
Both sides were well satisfied with the presenta- 
tion of their views. Certainly neither was con- 
verted to the position of the other. The debate 
served, however, to set before the country with 
greater clearness than ever before the two great 
systems of constitutional interpretation that were 
struggling for mastery, and large numbers of men 
whose ideas had been hazy were now led to adopt 
thoughtfully cither the one body of opinions or the 
other. The country was not yet ready to follow 
the controversy to the end which Webster clearly 
foresaw — civil war. But each side treasured its 
vitalized and enriched arguments for use in a more 
strenuous day. 
Advantage in the great discussion lay partly with 
Hayne and partly with his brilliant antagonist. 
On the whole, the facts of history were on the side
-P-A-G-E-161
66 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
of Hayne. Webster attempted to argue from 
the intent of the framers of the Constitution and 
from early opinion concerning the nature of the 
Union; but a careful appraisal of the evidence 
hardly bears out his contentions. On economic 
matters also, notably the operation of the protec- 
tive tariff, he trod uncertain ground. He realized 
this fact and as far as possible kept clear of eco- 
nomic discussion. The South had real grievances, 
and Webster was well enough aware that they 
could not be argued out of existence. 
On the other hand, the Northerner was vastly 
superior to his opponent in his handling of the 
theoretical issues of constitutional law; and in his 
exposition of the practical difficulties that would 
attend the operation of the principle of nullifica- 
tion he employed a fund of argument that was 
simply unanswerable. The logic of the larger 
phases of the situation lay, too, with him. If the 
Union for which he pleaded was not the Union 
which the Fathers intended to establish or even 
that which actually existed in the days of Washing- 
ton and the elder Adams, it was at all events the 
Union in which, by the close of the fourth decade 
under the Constitution, a majority of the people 
of the United States had come to believe. It was
-P-A-G-E-162
THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE 157 
the Union of Henry Clay, of Andrew Jackson, of 
Abraham Lincoln. And the largest significance of 
Webster’s arguments in 1830 arises from the defi- 
niteness and force which they put into popular 
convictions that until then were vague and inartic- 
ulate — convictions which, as has been well said, 
“went on broadening and deepening until, thirty 
years afterward, they had a force sufficient to sus- 
tain the North and enable her to triumph in the 
terrible struggle which resulted in the preservation 
of national life.’ It was the Second Reply to 
Hayne which, more than any other single event or 
utterance between 1789 and 1860, “compacted the 
States into a nation.”
-P-A-G-E-163
CHAPTER VII 
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 
Iv was more than brilliant oratory that had drawn 
to the Senate chamber the distinguished audi- 
ences faced by Webster and Hayne in the great 
debate of 1830. The issues discussed touched 
the vitality and permanence of the nation itself. 
Nullification was no mere abstraction of the sena- 
tor from South Carolina. It was a principle 
which his State — and, for aught one could tell, 
his section — was about to put into action. Al- 
ready, in 1830, the air was tense with the coming 
controversy. 
South Carolina had traveled a long road, politi- 
cally, smce 1789. In the days of Washington and 
the elder Adams the State was strongly Federalist. 
In 1800 Jefferson secured its electoral vote. But 
the Virginian’s leadership was never fully accepted, 
and even before the Republican party had else- 
where submitted to the inevitable nationalization 
158
-P-A-G-E-164
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 159 
the South Carolina membership was openly ar- 
rayed on the side of a protective tariff, the Na- 
tional Bank, and internal improvements. Calhoun 
and Cheves were for years among the most ar- 
dent exponents of broad constitutional construc- 
tion; Hayne himself was elected to the Senate in 
1822 as a nationalist, and over another candidate 
whose chief handicap was that he had proposed 
that his State secede rather than submit to the 
Missouri Compromise. 
After 1824 sentiment rapidly shifted. The cause 
appeared to be the tariff; but in reality deeper 
forces were at work. South Carolina was an agri- 
cultural State devoted almost exclusively to the 
raising of cotton and rice. Soil and climate made 
her such, and the “‘ peculiar institution”’ confirmed 
what Nature already had decreed. But the plant- 
ers were now beginning to feel keenly the competi- 
tion of the new cotton lands of the Gulf plains. 
As production increased, the price of cotton fell. 
“In 1816,” writes Professor Turner, “the average 
price of middling uplands . . . was nearly thirty 
cents, and South Carolina’s leaders favored the 
tariff; in 1820 it was seventeen cents, and the 
South saw in the protective system a grievance; 
in 1824 it was fourteen and three-quarters cents,
-P-A-G-E-165
160 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
and the South Carolinians denounced the tariff as 
unconstitutional.”? 
Men of the Clay-Adams school argued that the 
tariff stimulated industry, doubled the profits of 
agriculture, augmented wealth, and hence pro- 
moted the well-being of the nation as a whole. 
The Southern planter was never able to discover 
in the protective system any real advantage for 
himself, but as long as the tariffs were moderate 
he was influenced by nationalistic sentiment to 
accept them. The demand for protection on the 
part of the Northern manufacturers seemed, how- 
ever, insatiable. An act of 1824 raised the duties 
on cotton and woolen goods. A measure of 1827 
which applied to woolens the ruinous principle 
already applied to cottons was passed by the House 
and was laid on the table in the Senate only by 
the casting vote of Vice President Calhoun. The 
climax was reached in the Tariff Act of 1828, which 
the Southerners themselves loaded with objection- 
able provisions in the vain hope of making it so 
abominable that even New England congressmen 
would vote against it. 
A few years of such legislation sufficed to rouse 
the South to a deep feeling of grievance. It was ne 
= Trrner, The Rise of the New West, p. 325.
-P-A-G-E-166
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 161 
longer a question of reasonable concession to the 
general national good. A vast artificial economic 
system had been set up, whose benefits accrued to 
the North and whose burdens fell disproportion- 
ately upon the South. The tone and temper of 
the manufacturing sections and of the agricultural 
West gave no promise of a change of policy. The 
obvious conclusion was that the planting interests 
must find some means of bringing pressure to bear 
for their own relief. 
The means which they found was nullification; 
and it fell to South Carolina, whose people were 
most ardent in their resentment of anything that 
looked like discrimination, to put the remedy to 
the test. The Legislature of this State had made 
an early beginning by denouncing the tariff of 1824 
as unconstitutional. In 1827 Robert J. Turnbull, 
one of the abler political leaders, published under 
the title of The Crisis a series of essays in which he 
boldly proclaimed nullification as the remedy. In 
the following summer Calhoun put the nullifica- 
tion doctrine into its first systematic form in a 
paper — the so-called Exposition — which for some 
time was known to the public only as the report of 
a committee of the Legislature. 
By 1829 the State was sharply divided into two 1
-P-A-G-E-167
162 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
parties, the nationalists and the nullifiers. All 
were agreed that the protective system was in- 
iquitous and that it must be broken down. The 
difference was merely as to method. The nation- 
alists favored working through the customary 
channels of legislative reform; the nullifiers urged 
that the State interpose its authority to prevent 
the enforcement of the objectionable laws. For 
a time the leaders wavered. But the swing of 
public sentiment in the direction of nullification 
was rapid and overwhelming, and one by one the 
representatives in Congress and other men of pro- 
minence fell into line. Hayne and McDuffie were 
among the first to give it their support; and Cal- 
houn, while he was for a time held back by his 
political aspirations and by his obligations as Vice 
President, came gradually to feel that his political 
future would be worth little unless he had the sup- 
port of his own State. 
As the election of 1828 approached, the hope of 
the discontented forces centered in Jackson. They 
did not overlook the fact that his record was that 
of a moderate protectionist. But the same was 
true of many South Carolinians and Georgians, 
and it seemed not at all impossible that, as a 
Southern man and a cotton planter, he should
-P-A-G-E-168
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 163 
undergo a change of heart no less decisive than 
that which Hayne and Calhoun had experienced. 
Efforts to draw him out, however, proved not very 
successful. Lewis saw to it that Jackson’s utter- 
ances while yet he was a candidate were safely 
colorless; and the single mention of the tariff con- 
tained in the inaugural address was susceptible of 
the most varied interpretations. The annual mes- 
sage of 1829 indicated opposition to protection; 
on the other hand, the presidential message of the 
next year not only asserted the full power of Con- 
gress to levy protective duties but declared the 
abandonment of protection “neither to be expect- 
ed or desired.” Gradually the antiprotectionist 
leaders were made to see that the tariff was not a 
subject upon which the President felt keenly, and 
that therefore it was useless to look to him for 
effective support. 
Even the adroit efforts which were made to get 
from the incoming executive expressions that could 
be interpreted as endorsements of nullification were 
successfully fended off. For some months the Presi- 
dent gave no outward sign of his disapproval. With 
more than his usual deliberateness, Jackson studied 
the situation, awaiting the right moment to speak 
out with the maximum of effect.
-P-A-G-E-169
164 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
The occasion finally came on April 13, 1830, at 
a banquet held in Washington in celebration of 
Jefferson’s birthday. The Virginia patron of de- 
mocracy had been dead four years, and Jackson 
had become, more truly than any other man, his 
successor. Jacksonian democracy was, however, 
something very different from Jeffersonian, and 
never was the contrast more evident than on this 
fateful evening. During the earlier part of the 
festivities a series of prearranged toasts, accom- 
panied by short speeches, put before the assem- 
blage the Jeffersonian teachings in a light highly 
favorable — doubtless unwarrantably so — to the 
ultra state rights theory. Then followed a number 
of volunteer toasts. The President was, of course, 
accorded the honor of proposing the first — and 
this gave Jackson his chance. Rising in his place 
and drawing himself up to his full height, he raised 
his right hand, looked straight at Calhoun and, 
amid breathless silence, exclaimed in that crisp, 
harsh tone that had so often been heard above 
the crashing of many rifles: “Our Union! It must 
be preserved!” 
An account of the scene which is given by Isaac 
Hill, a member of the Kitchen Cabinet and an eye- 
witness, is interesting:
-P-A-G-E-170
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 165 
A proclamation of martial law in South Carolina and 
an order to arrest Calhoun where he sat could not have 
come with more blinding, staggering force. All hilarity 
ceased. The President, without adding one word in 
the way of speech, lifted up his glass as a notice that the 
toast was to be quaffed standing. Calhoun rose with the 
rest. His glass so trembled in his hand that a little of 
the amber fluid trickled down the side. Jackson stood 
silent and impassive. There was no response to the 
toast. Calhoun waited until all sat down. Then he 
slowly and with hesitating accent offered the second 
volunteer toast: “The Union! Next to Our Liberty 
Most Dear!” Then, after a minute’s hesitation, and in 
a way that left doubt as to whether he intended it for 
part of the toast or for the preface to a speech, he added: 
“May we all remember that it can only be preserved by 
respecting the rights of the States and by distributing 
equally the benefit and burden of the Union.” 
The nullifiers had carefully planned the eve- 
ning’s proceedings with a purpose to strengthen 
their cause with the country. They had not reck- 
oned on the President, and the dash of cold water 
which he had administered caused them more 
anguish than any opposition that they had yet 
encountered. The banquet broke up earlier than 
had been expected, and the diners went off by twos 
and threes in eager discussion of the scene that they 
had witnessed. Some were livid with rage; some 
shook their heads in fear of civil war; but most
-P-A-G-E-171
166 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
rejoiced in the splendid exhibition of executive dig- 
nity and patriotic fervor which the President had 
given. Subsequently it transpired that Jackson 
had acted on no mere impulse and that his course 
had been carefully planned in consultation with 
Van Buren and other advisers. 
Throughout the summer and autumn of 1830 
both the State Rights and Union parties in South 
Carolina worked feverishly to perfect their organi- 
zations. The issue that both were making ready to 
meet was nothing less than the election of a con- 
vention to nullify the tariff laws. Those uphold- 
ing nullification lost no opportunity to consolidate 
their forces, and by the close of the year these 
were clearly in the majority, although the union- 
ist element contained many of the ablest and 
most respected men in the State. Calhoun di- 
rected the nullifier campaign, though he did not 
throw off all disguises until the summer of the 
following year. 
Though Jackson made no further public declara- 
tions, the views which he expressed in private were 
usually not slow to reach the public ear. In a 
letter to a committee of the Union party in re- 
sponse to an invitation to attend a Fourth of July 
dinner the President intimated that force might
-P-A-G-E-172
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 167 
properly be employed if nullification should be at- 
tempted. And to a South Carolina Congressman 
who was setting off on a trip home he said: “Tell 
them [the nullifiers] from me that they can talk and 
‘write resolutions and print threats to their hearts’ 
content. But if one drop of blood be shed there in 
defiance of the laws of the United States, I will 
hang the first man of them I can get my hands on 
to the first tree I can find.”” When Hayne heard of 
this threat he expressed in Benton’s hearing a 
doubt as to whether the President would really 
hang anybody. “TI tell you, Hayne,” the Missou- 
rian replied, “when Jackson begins to talk about 
hanging, they can begin to look for the ropes.” 
Meanwhile actual nullification awaited the de- 
cision of the Vice President to surrender himself 
completely to the cause and to become its avowed 
leader. Calhoun did not find this an easy decision 
to make. Above all things he wanted to be Presi- 
dent. He was not the author of nullification; and 
although he did not fully realize until too late how 
much his state rights leanings would cost him in 
the North, he was shrewd enough to know that his 
political fortunes would not be bettered by his be- 
coming involved in a great sectional controversy. 
Circumstances worked together, however, to force
-P-A-G-E-173
168 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Calhoun gradually into the position of chief prom- 
inence in the dissenting movement. The tide of 
public opinion in his State swept him along with it; 
the breach with Jackson severed the last tie with 
the northern and western democracy; and his re- 
sentment of Van Buren’s rise to favor prompted 
words and acts which completed the isolation of 
the South Carolinian. His party’s enthusiastic ac- 
ceptance of Jackson as a candidate for reélection 
in 1832 and of “Little Van” as a candidate for 
the vice presidency — and, by all tokens, for the 
presidency four years later — was the last straw. 
Broken and desperate, Calhoun sank back into the 
role of an extremist, sectional leader. There was 
no need of further concealment; and in midsummer, 
1831, he issued his famous Address to the People of 
South Carolina, and this restatement of the Ex- 
position of 1828 now became the avowed platform 
of the nullification party. The Fort Hill Letter of 
August 28, 1832, addressed to Governor Hamilton, 
was a simpler and clearer presentation of the same 
body of doctrine. 
Matters were at last brought to a head by a new 
piece of tariff legislation which was passed in 1832 
not to appease South Carolina but to take advan- 
tage of acomfortable state of affairs that had arisen
-P-A-G-E-174
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 169 
in the national treasury. The public lands were 
again selling well, and the late tariff laws were 
yielding lavishly. The national debt was dwin- 
dling to the point of disappearance, and the country 
had more money than it could use. Jackson there- 
fore called upon Congress to revise the tariff system 
so as to reduce the revenue, and in the session of 
1831-32 several bills to that end were brought for- 
ward. The scale of duties finally embodied in the 
Act of July 14, 1832, corrected many of the anoma- 
lies of the Act of 1828, but it cut off some mil- 
lions of revenue without making any substantial 
change in the protective system. Virginia and 
North Carolina voted heavily for the bill, but 
South Carolina and Georgia as vigorously opposed 
it; and the nullifiers refused to see in it any con- 
cession to the tariff principles for which they stood. 
“TI no longer consider the question one of free 
trade,” wrote Calhoun when the passage of the bill 
was assured, “‘but of consolidation.” In an address 
to their constituents the South Carolina delegation 
in Congress declared that “protection must now be 
regarded as the settled policy of the country,” 
that “‘all hope from Congress is irrevocably gone,” 
and that it was for the people to decide “whether 
the rights and liberties which you received as a
-P-A-G-E-175
170 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSGN 
precious inheritance from an illustrious ancestry 
shall be tamely surrendered without a struggle, or 
transmitted undiminished to your posterity.” 
In the disaffected State events now moved 
rapidly. The elections of the early autumn were 
carried by the nullifiers, and the new Legisla- 
ture, acting on the recommendation of Gover- 
nor Hamilton, promptly called a state conven- 
tion to consider whether the “federal compact” 
had been violated and what remedy should be 
adopted. The 162 delegates who gathered at Co- 
lumbia on the 19th of November were, socially 
and politically, the élite of the State: Hamiltons, 
Haynes, Pinckneys, Butlers — almost all of the 
great families of a State of great families were 
represented. From the outset the convention 
was practically of one mind; and an ordinance of 
nullification drawn up by a committee of twenty- 
one was adopted within five days by a vote of 
136 to 26. 
The tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 were declared 
“null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this 
State, its officers or citizens.” None of the duties 
in question were to be permitted to be collected in 
the State after February 1, 1833. Appeals to the 
federal courts for enforcement of the invalidated
-P-A-G-E-176
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 171 
acts were forbidden, and all officeholders, except 
members of the Legislature, were required to take 
an oath to uphold the ordinance. Calhoun had la- 
boriously argued that nullification did not mean dis- 
union. But his contention was not sustained by the 
words of the ordinance, which stated unequivocally 
that the people of the State would not “submit to 
the application of force on the part.of the federal 
Government to reduce this State to obedience.” 
Should force be used, the ordinance boldly declared 
— indeed, should any action contrary to the will 
of the people be taken to execute the measures 
declared void — such efforts would be regarded 
as “inconsistent with the longer continuance of 
South Carolina in the Union,”’ and “the people of 
this State” would “thenceforth hold themselves 
absolved from all further obligation to maintain or 
preserve their political connection with the people 
of the other States, and will forthwith proceed to 
organize a separate Government, and to do all 
other acts and things which sovereign and inde- 
pendent States may of right do.” 
In accordance with the instructions of the con- 
vention, the Legislature forthwith reassembled to 
pass the measures deemed necessary to enforce 
the ordinance. A replevin act provided for the
-P-A-G-E-177
172 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
recovery of goods seized or detained for payment 
of duty; the use of military force, including volun- 
teers, to “‘repel invasion” was authorized; and 
provision was made for the purchase of arms 
and ammunition. Throughout the State a martial 
tone resounded. Threats of secession and war 
were heard on every side. Nightly meetings were 
held and demonstrations were organized. Blue 
cockades with a palmetto button in the center be- 
came the most popular of ornaments. Medals 
were struck bearing the inscription: “John C. 
CaJhoun, First President of the Southern Confeder- 
acy.” The Legislature, reassembling in Decem- 
ber, elected Hayne as Governor and chose Calhoun 
— who now resigned the vice presidency — to take 
the vacant seat in the Senate. In his first message 
to the Legislature Webster’s former antagonist 
declared his purpose to carry into full effect the 
nullification ordinance and the legislation supple- 
mentary to it, and expressed confidence that, if the 
sacred soil of the State should be “‘polluted by the 
footsteps of an invader,” no one of her sons would 
be found “raising a parricidal arm against our 
common mother.” 
Thus the proud commonwealth was panoplied 
for a contest of wits, and perchance of arms, with
-P-A-G-E-178
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 173 
the nation. Could it hope to win? South Carolina 
had a case which had been forcibly and plausibly 
presented. It could count on a deep reluctance 
of men in every part of the country to see the 
nation fall into actual domestic combat. There 
were, however, a dozen reasons why victory could 
not reasonably be looked for. One would have 
been enough — the presence of Andrew Jackson in 
the White House. 
Through federal officers and the leaders of the 
Union party Jackson kept himself fully informed 
upon the situation, and six weeks before the nul- 
lification convention was called he began prepara- 
tions to meet all eventualities. The naval authori- 
ties at Norfolk were directed to be in readiness to 
dispatch a squadron to Charleston; the command- 
ers of the forts in Charleston Harbor were ordered 
to double their vigilance and to defend their posts 
against any persons whatsoever; troops were or- 
dered from Fortress Monroe; and General Scott 
was sent to take full command and to strengthen 
the defenses as he found necessary. The South 
Carolinians were to be allowed to talk, and even to 
adopt “ordinances,” to their hearts’ content. But 
the moment they stepped across the line of dis- 
obedience to the laws of the United States they
-P-A-G-E-179
176 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Hayne-Calhoun creed: “I consider the power te 
annul a law of the United States, assumed by 
one State, incompatible with the existence of the 
Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the 
Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, incon- 
sistent with every principle on which it was found- 
ed, and destructive of the great object for which 
it was formed.” 
Throughout the North this vindication of na- 
tional dignity and power struck a responsive chord, 
and for once even the Adams and Clay men found’ 
themselves in hearty agreement with the President. 
Bostonians gathered in Faneuil Hall and New 
Yorkers in a great meeting in the Park to shower 
encomiums upon the proclamation and upon its 
author. The nullifiers did not at once recoil from 
the blow. The South Carolina Legislature called 
upon Governor Hayne officially to warn ‘the good 
people of this State against the attempt of the 
President of the United States to seduce them from 
their allegiance”; and the resulting counterblast, 
in the form of a proclamation made public on the 
20th of December, was as vigorous as the liveliest 
“‘fire-eater”’ could have wished. The Governor de: 
clared that the State would maintain its sover- 
eignty or be “buried beneath its ruins.”
-P-A-G-E-180
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 177 
The date of the expected crisis — February 1, 
1833, when the nullification ordinance was to take 
effect —- was now near at hand, and on both sides 
preparations were pushed. During the interval, 
however, the tide turned decidedly against the 
nuilifiers. A call for a general convention of the 
States “‘to determine and consider . . . questions 
of disputed power” served only to draw out strong 
expressions of disapproval of the South Carolina 
program, showing that it could not expect even 
moral support from outside. On the 16th of Janu- 
ary Jackson asked Congress for authority to alter 
or abolish certain ports of entry, to use force to 
execute the revenue laws, and to try in the federal 
courts cases that might arise from the present 
emergency. Five days later a bill on these lines — 
popularly denominated the “Force Bill’ — was 
introduced; and while many men who had no sym- 
pathy with nullification drew back from a plan in- 
volving the coercion of a State, it was soon settled 
that some sort of measure for strengthening the 
President’s hand would be passed. 
Meanwhile a way of escape from the whole diffi- 
culty was unexpectedly opened. The friends of 
Van Buren began to fear that the disagreement of 
North and South upon the tariff question would
-P-A-G-E-181
178 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
cost their favorite the united support of the party 
in 1836. Accordingly they set on foot a movement 
in Congress to bring about a moderate reduction of 
the prevailing rates; and it was of course their hope 
that the nullifiers would be induced to recede al- 
together from the position which they had taken. 
Through Verplanck of New York, the Ways and 
Means Committee of the House brought in a 
measure reducing the duties, within two years, to 
about half the existing rates. Jackson approved 
the plan, although personally he had little to do 
with it. 
But though the Verplanck Bill could not muster 
sufficient support to become law, it revived tariff 
discussion on promising lines, and it brought nulli- 
fication proceedings to a halt in the very nick of 
time. Shortly before February 1, 1833, the leading 
nullifiers came together in Charleston and entered 
into an extralegal agreement to postpone the en- 
forcement of the nullification ordinance until the 
outcome of the new tariff debates should be known. 
The failure of the Verplanck measure, however, 
left matters where they were, and civil war in South 
Carolina again loomed ominously. 
In this juncture patriots of all parties turned to 
the one man whose leadership seemed indispensable
-P-A-G-E-182
TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION 179 
in tariff legislation — the “great pacificator,” Henry 
Clay, who after two years in private life had just 
taken his seat in the Senate. Clay was no friend 
of Jackson or of Van Buren, and it required much 
sacrifice of personal feeling to lend his services to 
a program whose political benefits would almost 
certainly accrue to his rivals. Finally, however, he 
yielded and on the 12th of February he rose in 
the Senate and offered a compromise measure 
proposing that on all articles which paid more 
than twenty per cent the amount in excess of 
that rate should be reduced by stages until in 
1842 it would entirely disappear. 
Stormy debates followed on both the Compro- 
mise Tariff and the Force Bill, but before the ses- 
sion closed on the 4th of March both were on the 
statute book. When, therefore, the South Caro- 
lina convention, in accordance with an earlier 
proclamation of Governor Hamilton, reassembled 
onthe 11th of March, the wind had been taken out of 
the nullifiers’ sails; the laws which they had “nulli- 
fied” had been repealed, and there was nothing for 
the convention to do but to rescind the late ordi- 
nance and the legislative measures supplementary 
to it. There was a chance, however, for one final 
fling. By a vote of 132 to 19 the convention soberly
-P-A-G-E-183
180 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
adopted an ordinance nullifying the Force Bill and 
calling on the Legislature to pass laws to prevent 
the execution of that measure — which, indeed, 
nobody was now proposing to execute. 
So the tempest passed. Both sides claimed vic- 
tory, and with some show of reason. So far as was 
possible without an actual test of strength, the 
authority of the Federal Government had been 
vindicated and its dignity maintained; the consti- 
tutional doctrines of Webster acquired a new sanc- 
tion; the fundamental point was enforced that a 
law — that every law — enacted by Congress must 
be obeyed until repealed or until set aside by the 
courts as unconstitutional. On the other hand, the 
nullifiers had brought about the repeal of the laws 
to which they objected and had been largely instru- 
mental in turning the tariff policy of the country 
for some decades into a new channel. Moreover 
they expressed no regret for their acts and in no 
degree renounced the views upon which those acts 
had been based. They submitted to the authority 
of the United States, but on terms fixed by them- 
selves. And, what is more, they supplied practi- 
cally every constitutional and political argument 
to be used by their sons in 1860 to justify secession.
-P-A-G-E-184
CHAPTER IX 
THE WAR ON THE UNITED STATES BANK 
“Norutne lacks now to complete the love-feast,” 
wrote Isaac Hill sardonically to Thomas H. Ben- 
ton after the collapse of nullification, “but for 
Jackson and Webster to solemnize the coalition 
{in support of the Union] with a few mint-juleps! 
Ithink I could arrange it, if assured of the codpera- 
tion of yourself and Blair on our side, and Jerry 
Mason and Nick Biddle on theirs. But never fear, 
my friend. This mixing of oil and water is only 
the temporary shake-up of Nullification. Wait till 
Jackson gets at the Bank again, and then the 
scalping-knives will glisten once more.” 
The South Carolina controversy had indeed 
brought Jacksonians and anti-Jacksonians together. 
But once the tension was relaxed, there began the 
conflict of interests which the New Hampshire edi- 
tor had predicted. Men fell again into their cus- 
tomary political relationships; issues that for the 
181
-P-A-G-E-185
182 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
moment had been pushed into the background — 
internal improvements, public land policy, dis- 
tribution of surplus revenue, and above all the 
Bank — were revived in full vigor. Now, indeed, 
the President entered upon the greatest task to 
which he had yet put his hand. To curb nullifi- 
cation was a worthy achievement. But, after 
all, Congress and an essentially united nation had 
stood firmly behind the Executive at every stage of 
that performance. To destroy the United States 
Bank was a different matter, for this institution 
had the full support of one of the two great par- 
ties in which the people of the country were 
now grouped; Jackson’s own party was by no 
means a unit in opposing it; and the prestige and 
influence of the Bank were such as to enable it 
to make a powerful fight against any attempts to 
annihilate it. 
The second Bank of the United States was char- 
tered in 1816 for twenty years, with a capital of 
thirty-five million dollars, one-fifth of which had 
been subscribed by the Government. For some 
time it was not notably successful, partly because 
of bad management but mainly because of the 
disturbance of business which the panic of 1819 
had produced. Furthermore, its power over local
-P-A-G-E-186
THE UNITED STATES BANK 183 
banks and over the currency system made it un- 
popular in the West and South, and certain States 
sought to cripple it by taxing out of existence the 
several branches which the board of directors 
voted to establish. In two notable decisions — 
M’Culloch vs. Maryland in 1819 and Osborn vs. 
United States Bank in 1824 — the Supreme Court 
saved the institution by denying the power of a 
State to impose taxation of the sort and by as- 
serting unequivocally the right of Congress to 
enact the legislation upon which the Bank rested. 
And after Nicholas Biddle, a Philadelphia lawyer- 
diplomat, succeeded Langdon Cheves as president 
of the Bank in 1823 an era of great prosperity 
set in. 
The forces of opposition were never reconciled; 
indeed, every evidence of the increasing strength 
of the Bank roused them to fresh hostility. The 
verdict of the Supreme Court in support of the 
constitutionality of the Act of 1816 carried convic- 
tion to few people who were not already convinced. 
The restraints which the Bank imposed upon the 
dubious operations of the southern and western 
banks were vigorously resented. The Bank was 
regarded as a great financial monopoly, an “octo- 
pus,” and Biddle as an autocrat bent only on
-P-A-G-E-187
184 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
dominating the entire banking and currency sys- 
tem of the country. 
On Jackson’s attitude toward the Bank before 
he became President we have little direct informa- 
tion. But it is sufficiently clear that eventually 
he came to share the hostile views of his Tennessee 
friends and neighbors. In 1817 he refused to sign 
a memorial “got up by the aristocracy of Nash- 
ville” for the establishment of a branch in that 
town. When, ten years later, such a branch was 
installed, General Thomas Cadwalader of Phila- 
delphia, agent of the Bank, visited the town 
to supervise the arrangements and became very 
friendly with the “lord of the Hermitage.” But 
correspondence of succeeding years, though filled 
with insinuating cordiality, failed to bring out any 
expression of goodwill toward the institution such 
as the agent manifestly coveted. 
Jackson seems to have carried to Washington in 
1829 a deep distrust of the Bank, and he was dis- 
posed to speak out boldly against it in his inaugural 
address. But he was persuaded by his friends 
that this would be ill-advised, and he therefore 
made no mention of the subject. Yet he made no 
effort to conceal his attitude, for he wrote to Biddle 
a few months after the inauguration that he did
-P-A-G-E-188
THE UNITED STATES BANK 185 
not believe that Congress had power to charter a 
bank outside of the District of Columbia, that he 
did not dislike the United States Bank more than 
other banks, but that ever since he had read the 
history of the South Sea Bubble he had been afraid 
of banks. After this confession the writer hardly 
needed to confess that he was “‘no economist, no 
financier.” 
Most of the officers of the “mother bank” at 
Philadelphia and of the branches were anti-Jackson 
men, and Jackson’s friends put the idea into his 
mind that the Bank had used its influence against 
him in the late campaign. Specific charges of par- 
tizanship were brought against Jeremiah Mason, 
president of the branch at Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire; and although an investigation showed 
the accusation to be groundless, Biddle’s heated 
defense of the branch had no effect save to rouse 
the Jacksonians to a firmer determination to com- 
pass the downfall of the Bank. 
Biddle labored manfully to stem the tide. He 
tried to improve his personal relations with the 
President, and he even allowed Jackson men to gain 
control of several of the western branches. The 
effort, however, was in vain. When he thought 
the situation right, Biddle brought forward a plan
-P-A-G-E-189
186 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
for a new charter which received the assent of most 
of the members of the official Cabinet, as well as 
that of some of the “Kitchen” group. But Jack- 
son met the proposal with his unshakable constitu- 
tional objections and, to Biddle’s deep disappoint- 
ment, advanced in his first annual message to the 
formal, public assault. The Bank’s charter, he 
reminded Congress, would expire in 1836; request 
for a new charter would probably soon be forth- 
coming; the matter could not receive too early 
attention from the legislative branch. “Both the 
constitutionality and the expediency of the law 
creating this bank,” declared the President, “‘are 
well questioned by a large portion of our fellow- 
citizens; and it must be admitted by all that it has 
failed in the great end of establishing a uniform 
and sound currency.” The first part of the state- 
ment was true, but the second was distinctly unfair. 
The Bank, to be sure, had not established “‘a uni- 
form and sound” currency. But it had accom- 
plished much toward that end and was practically 
the only agency that was wielding any influence in 
that direction. The truth is that the more efficient 
the Bank proved in this task the less popular it 
became among those elements of the people from 
which Jackson mainly drew his strength.
-P-A-G-E-190
THE UNITED STATES BANK 187 
Nothing came of the President’s admonition 
except committee reports in the two Houses, both 
favorable to the Bank; in fact, the Senate report 
was copied almost verbatim from a statement sup- 
plied by Biddle. A year later Jackson returned 
to the subject, this time with an alternative plan 
for a national bank to be organized as a branch 
of the Treasury and hence to have ‘no means to 
operate on the hopes, fears, or interests of large 
masses of the community.” In aset of autograph 
notes from which the second message was prepared 
the existing Bank was declared not only uncon- 
stitutional but dangerous to liberty, “because 
through its officers, loans, and participation in 
politics it could build up or pull down parties or 
men, because it created a monopoly of the money 
power, because much of the stock was owned by 
foreigners, because it would always support him 
who supported it, and because it weakened the 
state and strengthened the general government.” 
Congress paid no attention to either criticisms or 
recommendations, and the supporters of the Bank 
took fresh heart. 
When Congress again met, in December, 1831, a 
presidential election was impending and everybody 
was wondering what part the bank question would
-P-A-G-E-191
188 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
play. Most Democrats were of the opinion that 
the subject should be kept in the background. 
After all, the present bank charter had more than 
four years to run, and there seemed to be no reason 
for injecting so thorny an issue into the campaign. 
With a view to keeping the bank authorities quiet, 
two members of the reconstructed Cabinet, Liv- 
ingston and McLane, entered into a modus vivendt 
with Biddle under which the Administration agreed 
not to push the issue until after the election. In 
his annual report as Secretary of the Treasury, 
McLane actually made an argument for recharter- 
ing the Bank; and in his message of the 6th of 
December the President said that, while he still 
held “‘the opinions heretofore expressed in rela- 
tion to the Bank as at present organized,” he would 
“leave it for the present to the investigation of an 
enlightened people and their representatives.” He 
had been persuaded that his own plan for a Bank, 
suggested a year earlier, was not feasible. 
Biddle now made 2 supreme mistake. Misled 
in some degree unquestionably by the optimistic 
McLane, he got the idea that Jackson was weaken- 
ing, that the Democrats were afraid to take a stand 
on the subject until after the election, and that 
now was the strategic time to strike for a new
-P-A-G-E-192
THE UNITED STATES BANK 189 
charter. In this belief he was further encouraged 
by Clay, Webster, and other leading anti-Ad- 
ministration men, as well as by McDuffie, a Cal- 
houn supporter and chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee of the House. There was 
small doubt that a bill for a new charter could be 
carried in both branches of Congress. Jackson 
must either sign it, argued Biddle’s advisers, or run 
grave risk of losing Pennsylvania and other com- 
mercial States whose support was necessary to his 
election. On the other hand, Biddle was repeatedly 
warned that an act for a new charter would be 
vetoed. He chose to press the issue and on January 
9, 1832, the formal application of the Bank for a 
renewal of its charter was presented to Congress, 
and within a few weeks bills to recharter were 
reported in both Houses. 
Realizing that defeat or even a slender victory 
in Congress would be fatal, the Bank flooded 
Washington with lobbyists, and Biddle himself 
appeared upon the scene to lead the fight. The 
measure was carried by safe majorities — in the 
Senate, on the 11th of June, by a vote of 28 to 20, 
and in the House on the 3d of July, by a vote of 
107 to 86. To the dismay of the bank forces, 
although it ought not to have been to their surprise,
-P-A-G-E-193
1909 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Jackson was as good as his word. On the 10th of 
July the bill was vetoed. The veto message as 
transmitted to the Senate was probably written 
by Taney, but the ideas were Jackson’s — ideas 
which, so far as they relate to finance and banking 
operations, have been properly characterized as 
“in the main beneath contempt.” The message, 
however, was intended as a campaign document, 
and as such it showed great ingenuity. It attacked 
the Bank as a monopoly, a “hydra of corruption,” 
and an instrumentality of federal encroachment on 
the rights of the States, and in a score of ways 
appealed to the popular distrust of capitalistic 
institutions. The message acquired importance, 
too, from the President’s extraordinary claim to 
the right of judging both the constitutionality and 
the expediency of proposed legislation, independ- 
ently of Congress and the Courts. 
The veto plunged the Senate into days of acrid 
debate. Clay pronounced Jackson’s construction 
of the veto power “irreconcilable with the genius 
of representative government.” Webster declared 
that responsibility for the ruin of the Bank and for 
the disasters that might follow would have to be 
borne by the President alone. Benton and other 
prominent members, however, painted Jackson as
-P-A-G-E-194
THE UNITED STATES BANK 191 
the savior of his country; and the second vote 
of 22 to 19 yielded a narrower majority for the 
bill than the first had done. Thus the measure 
perished. 
The bank men received the veto with equanim- 
ity. They professed to believe that the balderdash 
in which the message abounded would make con- 
verts for their side; they even printed thirty 
thousand copies of the document for circulation. 
Events, however, did not sustain their optimism. 
In the ensuing campaign the Bank became, by its 
own choice, the leading issue. The National 
Republicans, whose nominee was Clay, defended 
the institution and attacked the veto; the Jack- 
sonians reiterated on the stump every charge and 
argument that their leader had taught them. ‘The 
verdict was decisive. Jackson received 219 and 
Clay 49 electoral votes. 
The President was unquestionably right in inter- 
preting his triumph as an endorsement of the veto, 
and he naturally felt that the question was settled. 
The officers and friends of the Bank still hoped, 
however, to snatch victory from defeat. They 
had no expectation of converting Jackson or of 
carrying a charter measure at an early date. But 
they foresaw that to wind up the business of the
-P-A-G-E-195
192 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Bank in 1836 it would be necessary to call in loans 
and to withdraw a vast amount of currency from 
circulation, with the result of a general disturb- 
ance, if not a severe crippling, of business. This, 
they thought, would bring about an eleventh-hour 
measure giving the Bank a new lease of life. 
Jackson, too, realized that a sudden termination 
of the activities of the Bank would derange busi- 
ness and produce distress, and that under these 
circumstances a charter might be wrung from 
‘Congress in spite of a veto. But he had no inten- 
tion of allowing matters to come to such a pass. 
His plan was rather to cut off by degrees the activi- 
ties of the Bank, until at last they could be sus- 
pended altogether without a shock. The most 
obvious means of doing this was to withdraw the 
heavy deposits made by the Government; and to 
this course the President fully committed himself 
as soon as the results of the election were known. 
He was impelled, further, by the conviction — 
notwithstanding unimpeachable evidence to the 
contrary — that the Bank was insolvent, and by 
his indignation at the refusal of Biddle and his 
associates to accept the electoral verdict as final. 
“Biddle shan’t have the public money to break 
down the public administration with. It’s settled.
-P-A-G-E-196
THE UNITED STATES BANK 193 
My mind’s made up.” .So the President declared 
to Blair early in 1833. And no one could have 
any reasonable doubt that decisive action would 
follow threat. 
It was not, however, all plain sailing. Under 
the terms of the charter of 1816 public funds were 
to be deposited in the Bank and its branches unless 
the Secretary of the Treasury should direct that 
they be placed elsewhere; and such deposits else- 
where, together with actual withdrawals, were to 
be reported to Congress, with reasons for such 
action. McLane, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
was friendly toward the Bank and could not be 
expected to give the necessary orders for removal. 
This meant that the first step was to get a new head 
for the Treasury. But McLane was too influential 
a man to be summarily dismissed. Hence it was 
arranged that Livingston should become Minister 
to France and that McLane should succeed him as 
Secretary of State. 
The choice of the new Secretary of the Treasury 
would have been a clever stroke if things had 
worked out as Jackson expected. The appointee 
was William J. Duane, son of the editor of the 
Aurora, which had long been the most popular and 
influential newspaper in Pennsylvania. This State 
73
-P-A-G-E-197
194 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
was the seat of the “mother bank” and, although 
a Jackson stronghold, a cordial supporter of the 
proscribed institution; so that it was well worth 
while to forestall criticism in that quarter, so far 
as might be, by having the order for removal issued 
by a Pennsylvanian. Duane, however, accepted 
the post rather because he coveted office than 
because he supported the policy of removal, and 
when the test came Jackson found to his chagrin 
that he still had a Secretary who would not take 
the desired action. There was nothing to do but 
procure another; and this time he made no mistake. 
Duane, weakly protesting, was dismissed, and 
Roger B. Taney, the Attorney-General, was ap- 
pointed in his stead. “I am fully prepared to go 
with you firmly through this business,” Jackson 
was assured by the new Secretary, “and to meet all 
its consequences.” 
The way was now clear, and an order was issued 
requiring all treasury receipts after October 1, 
1833, to be deposited in the Girard Bank of Phila- 
delphia and twenty-two other designated state 
banks. Deposits in the United States Bank and 
its branches were not immediately “removed”; 
they were left, rather, to be withdrawn as the 
money was actually needed. Nevertheless there
-P-A-G-E-198
THE UNITED STATES BANK 195 
was considerable disturbance of business, and dep- 
utation after deputation came to the White House 
to ask that Taney’s order be rescinded. Jackson, 
however, was sure that most of the trouble wag¥ 
caused by Biddle and his associates, and to all these 
appeals he remained absolutely deaf. After atime 
he refused so much as to see the petitioners. In 
his message of the 3d of December he assumed 
full responsibility for the removals, defending his 
course mainly on the ground that the Bank had 
been ‘‘actively engaged in attempting to influence 
the elections of the public officers by means of 
its money.” 
From this point the question became entirely 
one of politics. The Bank itself wasdoomed. On 
the one side, the National Republicans united in 
the position that the Administration had been 
entirely in the wrong, and that the welfare of the 
country demanded a great fiscal institution of 
the character of the Bank. On the other side, the 
Democrats, deriving, indeed, a new degree of unity 
from the controversy on this issue, upheld the 
President’s every word and act. ‘You may con- 
tinue,” said Benton to his fellow partizans in the 
Senate, ‘“‘to be for a bank and for Jackson, but you 
cannot be for this Bank and Jackson.” Firmly
-P-A-G-E-199
196 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
allied with the Bank interests, the National Repub- 
licans resolved to bring all possible discomfiture 
upon the Administration. 
The House of Representatives was controlled by 
the Democrats, and little could be accomplished 
there. But the Senate contained not only the three 
ablest anti-Jacksonians of the day — Clay, Web- 
ster, Calhoun — but an absolute majority of anti- 
Administration men; and there the attack was 
launched. On December 26, 1833, Clay intro- 
duced two resolutions declaring that in the removal 
of the deposits the President had “‘assumed upon 
himself authority and power not conferred by the 
Constitution and laws but in derogation of both,” 
and pronouncing Taney’s statement of reasons 
“unsatisfactory and insufficient.” After a stormy 
debate, both resolutions in slightly amended form 
were carried by substantial majorities. 
Jackson was not in the habit of meekly swallow- 
ing censure, and on the 15th of April he sent to the 
Senate a formal protest, characterizing the action 
of the body as “unauthorized by the Constitution, 
contrary to its spirit and to several of its express 
provisions,” and “subversive of that distribution 
of the powers of government which it has ordained 
and established.” Aside from a general defense of
-P-A-G-E-200
THE UNITED STATES BANK 197 
his course, the chief point that the President made 
was that the Constitution provided a procedure in 
eases of this kind, namely impeachment, which 
alone could be properly resorted to if the legislative 
branch desired to bring charges against the Execu- 
tive. The Senate was asked respectfully to spread 
the protest on its records. This, however, it re- 
fused to do. On the contrary, it voted that the 
right of protest could not be recognized; and it 
found additional satisfaction in negativing an 
unusual number of the President’s nominations. 
Throughout the remainder of his second Ad- 
ministration Jackson maintained his hold upon the 
country and kept firm control in the lower branch 
of Congress. Until very near the end, the Senate, 
however, continued hostile. During the debate on 
the protest Benton served notice that he would 
introduce, at each succeeding session, a motion to 
expunge the resolution of censure. Such a motion 
was made in 1835, and again in 1836, without 
result. But at last, in January, 1837, after a de- 
bate lasting thirteen hours, the Senate adopted, by 
a vote of 24 to 19, a resolution meeting the Jack- 
sonian demand. 
The manuscript journal of the session of 1833-1834 was 
brought into the Senate, and the secretary, in obedience
-P-A-G-E-201
198 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
to the resolution, drew black lines around the resolution 
of censure, and wrote across the face thereof, “in strong 
letters,” the words: “Expunged by order of the Senate, 
this sixteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord 
1837." Many members withdrew rather than witness 
the proceeding; but a crowded gallery looked on, while 
Benton strengthened his supporters by providing “an 
ample supply of cold hams, turkeys, rounds of beef, 
pickles, wines, and cups of hot coffee” in a near-by 
committee-room. Jackson gave a dinner to the “ex- 
pungers” and their wives, and placed Benton at the 
head of the table. That the action of the Senate was un- 
constitutional interested no one save the lawyers, for 
the Bank was dead. Jackson was vindicated, and the 
people were enthroned. * 
The struggle thus brought to a triumphant close 
was one of the severest in American political his- 
tory. In 1836 the Bank obtained a charter from 
Pennsylvania, under the name of the Bank of the 
United States of Pennsylvania, and all connection 
between it and the Federal Government ceased. 
The institution and the controversies centering 
about it left, however, a deep impress upon the 
financial and political history of our fifth and sixth 
decades. It was the bank issue, more than any- 
thing else, that consolidated the new political 
parties of the period. It was that issue that 
tMacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, p. 239.
-P-A-G-E-202
THE UNITED STATES BANK 199 
proved most conclusively the hold of Jackson upon 
public opinion. And it was the destruction of the 
Bank that capped the mid-century reaction against 
the rampant nationalism of the decade succeeding 
the War of 1812. The Bank itself had been well 
managed, sound, and of great service to the coun- 
try. But it had also showed strong monopolistic 
tendencies, and as a powerful capitalistic organiza- 
tion it ran counter to the principles and prejudices 
which formed the very warp and woof of Jack- 
sonian democracy. 
For more than a decade after the Bank was 
destroyed the United States had a troubled finan- 
cial history. The payment of the last dollar of the 
national debt in 1834 gave point to a suggestion 
which Clay had repeatedly offered that, as a 
means of avoiding an embarrassing surplus, the 
" proceeds of the sales of public lands should be dis- 
tributed according to population among the States. 
One bill on this subject was killed by a veto in 
1832, but another was finally approved in 1836. 
Before distribution could be carried far, however, 
the country was overtaken by the panic of 1837; 
and never again was there a surplus to distribute. 
For seven years the funds of the Government con- 
tinued to be kept in state banks, until, in 1840,
-P-A-G-E-203
200 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
President Van Buren prevailed upon Congress to 
pass a measure setting up an independent treasury 
system, thereby realizing the ultimate purpose of 
the Jacksonians to divorce the Government from 
banks of every sort. When the Whigs came into 
power in 1841, they promptly abolished the in- 
dependent Treasury with a view to resurrecting 
the United States Bank. Tyler’s vetoes, however, 
frustrated their designs, and it remained for the 
Democrats in 1846 to revive the independent 
Treasury and to organize it substantially as it 
operates today.
-P-A-G-E-204
CHAPTER X 
THE REMOVAL OF THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 
It was not by chance that the Jacksonian period 
made large contribution to the working out of the 
ultimate relations of the red man with his white 
rival and conqueror. Jackson was himself an old 
frontier soldier, who never doubted that it was 
part of the natural order of things that conflict. 
between the two peoples should go on until the 
weaker was dispossessed or exterminated. The 
era was one in which the West guided public policy; 
and it was the West that was chiefly interested 
in further circumscribing Indian lands, trade, 
and influence. In Jackson’s day, too, the people 
ruled; and it was the adventurous, pushing, land- 
hungry common folk who decreed that the red man 
had lingered long enough in the Middle West and 
must now move on. 
The pressure of the white population upon the 
Indian lands was felt both in the Northwest and in 
201
-P-A-G-E-205
202 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
the Southwest; but the pressure was unevenly 
applied in the two sections. North of the Ohio 
there was simply one great glacier-like advance of 
the white settlers, driving westward before it 
practically all of the natives who did not perish in 
the successive attempts to roll back the wave of 
conquest upon the Alleghanies. The redskins were 
+ pushed from Ohio into Indiana, from Indiana into 
Illinois, from Hlinois and Wisconsin into Iowa and 
Minnesota; the few tribal fragments which by 
treaty arrangement remained behind tormed only 
insignificant “islands” in the midst of the fast- 
growing flood of white population. 
In the South the great streams of migration were 
those that flowed down the Ohio, filling the back 
lands on each side, and thence down the Mississippi 
to its mouth. Hence, instead of pressing the na- 
tives steadily backward from a single direction, as 
in the North, the whites hemmed them in on east, 
west, and north; while to the southward the Gulf 
presented a relentless barrier. Powerful and pop- 
ulous tribes were left high and dry in Georgia, 
‘Tennessee, and Alabama — peoples who in their 
dlay of necessity could hope to find new homes only 
by long migrations past the settled river districts 
that lay upon their western frontiers.
-P-A-G-E-206
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 203 
Of these encircled tribes, four were of chief im- 
portance: the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, 
and the Chickasaws. In 1825 the Creeks num- 
bered twenty thousand, and held between five and 
six million acres of land in western Georgia and 
eastern Alabama. The Cherokees numbered about 
nine thousand and had even greater areas, mainly 
in northwestern Georgia, but to some extent also 
in northeastern Alabama and southeastern Ten- 
nessee. The Choctaws, numbering twenty-one 
thousand, and the Chickasaws, numbering thirty- 
six hundred, together held upwards of sixteen 
million acres in Mississippi — approximately the 
northern half of the State — and a million and a 
quarter acres in western Alabama. The four 
peoples thus numbered fifty-three thousand souls, 
and held ancestral lands aggregating over thirty- 
three million acres, or nearly the combined area of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Furthermore, they were no longer savages. The 
Creeks were the lowest in civilization; but even 
they had become more settled and less warlike 
since their chastisement by Jackson in 1814. The 
Choctaws and Chickasaws lived in frame houses, 
cultivated large. stretches of land, operated work- 
shops and mills, maintained crude but orderly
-P-A-G-E-207
204 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
governments, and were gradually accepting Chris- 
tianity. Most advanced of all were the Chero- 
kees. As one writer has described them, they 
“had horses and cattle, goats, sheep, and swine. 
They raised maize, cotton, tobacco, wheat, oats, 
and potatoes, and traded with their products ta 
New Orleans. They had gardens, and apple and 
peach orchards. They had built roads, and they 
kept inns for travelers. They manufactured cot- 
ton and wool. . .. One of their number had in- 
vented an alphabet for their language. They had 
a civil government, imitated from that of the 
United States.” Under these improved conditions, 
all of the tribes were growing in numbers and ac- 
quiring vested rights which it would be increas- 
ingly difficult to deny or to disregard. 
A good while before Jackson entered the White 
House the future of these large, settled, and pros- 
perous groups of red men began to trouble the 
people of Georgia, Alabama, and other Southern 
States. The Indians made but little use of the 
major part of their land; vast tracts lay un- 
trodden save by hunters. Naturally, as the white 
population grew and the lands open for settlement 
became scarcer and poorer, the rich tribal holdings 
were looked upon with covetous eyes. In the
-P-A-G-E-208
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 205 
decade following the War of 1812, when cotton 
cultivation was spreading rapidly over the south- 
ern interior, the demand that they be thrown 
open for occupation to white settlers became 
almost irresistible. 
Three things, obviously, could happen. The 
tribes could be allowed to retain permanently their 
great domains, while the white population flowed 
in around them; or the lands could be opened to 
the whites under terms looking to a peaceful inter- 
mingling of the two peoples; or the tribes could 
be induced or compelled to move en masse to new 
homes beyond the Mississippi. The third plan 
was the only one ever considered by most people to 
be feasible, although it offered great difficulties 
and was carried out only after many delays. 
The State which felt the situation most keenly 
was Georgia, partly because there an older and 
denser population pressed more eagerly for new 
lands, partly —it must be admitted — because 
lands obtained by cession were, under the practice 
of that State, distributed among the people by 
lottery. The first move in this direction was to 
dispossess the Creeks. As far back as 1802, when 
Georgia made her final cession of western lands to 
the United States, the latter agreed to extinguish
-P-A-G-E-209
206 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
the Indian title to lands within the State whenever 
it could be done “peaceably and on reasonable 
terms.” This pledge the Georgians never allowed 
the federal authorities to forget. After 1815 several 
large tracts were liberated. But by that date the 
State wanted unbroken jurisdiction over all of 
the territory within her limits, and her complaints 
of laxness on the part of the Federal Government 
in bringing this about became no less frequent 
than vigorous. 
Near the close of his Administration President 
Monroe sent two commissioners to procure a 
general cession; and at Indian Spring a treaty was 
concluded in which the Creeks ceded practically 
all of their lands between the Flint and the Chat- 
tahoochee rivers. The Senate ratified the treaty, 
and the Georgians were elated. But investigation 
showed that the Creeks who stood behind the 
agreement represented only an insignificant frac- 
tion of the nation, and President Adams refused to 
allow Troup, the irate Georgian Governor, to pro- 
ceed with the intended occupation until further 
negotiations should have taken place. Stormy ex- 
changes of views followed, in the course of which 
the Governor more than once reminded Adams that 
Georgia was “sovereign on her own soil.” But in
-P-A-G-E-210
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 207 
1826 and 1827 treaties were obtained finally ex- 
tinguishing Creek titles in the State. Land west 
of the Mississippi was promised to all Creeks who 
would go there. 
The problem of the Cherokees was more difficult. 
By a series of treaties beginning in 1785 the United 
States had recognized this people as a nation, capa- 
ble of making peace and war, of owning the lands 
within its boundaries, and of governing and punish- 
ing its own citizens by its own Jaws. At the close 
of Jefferson’s second Administration the tribe seri- 
ously considered moving west of the Mississippi, 
and shortly after the War of 1812 most of the 
northern members resident in Tennessee took the 
long-deferred step. The refusal of the Georgia 
members to go with the Tennesseeans disappointed 
the land-hungry whites, and from that time the 
authorities of the State labored incessantly both to 
break down the notion that the Cherokees were 
a “nation” to be dealt with through diplomatic 
channels, and to extend over them, in effect, the 
full sovereignty of the State. In December, 1828, 
the Legislature took the bold step of enacting that 
all white persons in the Cherokee territory should 
be subject to the laws of Georgia; that after June 
1, 1830, all Indians resident in this territory should
-P-A-G-E-211
208 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
be subject to such laws as might be prescribed for 
them by the State; and that after this date all laws 
made by the Cherokee Government should be null 
and void. 
When Jackson became President he found on his 
desk a vigorous protest against this drastic piece of 
legislation. But appeal to him was useless. He 
was on record as believing, in common with most 
southwesterners, that Georgia had a rightful juris- 
diction over her Indian lands; and his Secretary 
of War, Eaton, was instructed to say to the Chero- 
kee representatives that their people would be ex- 
pected either to yield to Georgia’s authority or to 
remove beyond the Mississippi. In his first annual 
message, on December 8, 1829, the President set 
forth the principles that guided him from first to 
last in dealing with the Indian problem. It would 
be greatly to the interest of the Indians themselves, 
he said, to remove to the ample lands that would be 
set apart for them permanently in the West, where 
each tribe could have its own home and its own 
government, subject to no control by the United 
States except for the maintenance of peace on the 
frontier and among the tribes. Forcible removal 
was not to be contemplated; that would be cruel 
and unjust. But every effort was to be made to
-P-A-G-E-212
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 209 
bring about a voluntary migration. One thing 
was to be clearly understood: any tribe or group 
that chose to remain in Georgia must submit to 
the laws of the State and yield its claim to all land 
which had not been improved. The President was 
not indifferent to the well-being of the red men; 
but he refused to recognize the Cherokees as a 
“nation” having “rights” as against either Geor- 
gia or the United States. A few weeks after the 
message was received Congress passed a bill creat- 
ing an Indian reservation beyond the Mississippi 
and appropriating five hundred thousand dollars 
to aid in the removal of such Indians as should 
choose to accept the offer of the Government. 
The outlook for the Cherokees was now dark. 
Both the executive and legislative branches of the 
Federal Government were committed to a policy 
which offered only the alternatives of removal or 
subjection; and, thus encouraged, the Georgia 
Legislature voted to proceed with the extension of 
the full authority of the State over both the Chero- 
kees and the Creeks after June 1, 1830. To make 
matters worse, the discovery of gold in the north-

upon the Cherokee lands a horde of scrambling, 
lawless fortune seekers, numbered already in 1830

by the thousand. None the less, the Cherokee 
opposition stiffened. The Indian legislative coun- 
cil voted that all who accepted lands beyond the 
Mississippi and settled on them should forfeit their 
tribal membership, that those who sold their in- 
dividual property to emigrate should be flogged, 
and that those who voied to sell a part or all of the 
tribal possessions should be put to death. 
One resource remained to be exhausted in 
defense of the Indian claims; this was the courts. 
But here again things went unfavorably. After 
many delays a test case, Cherokee Nation vs. State 
of Georgia, was placed upon the docket of the Su- 
preme Court. The bill set forth the plaintiff to be 
“the Cherokee Nation of Indians, a foreign State, 
not owning allegiance to the United States, nor to 
any State of this union, nor to any prince, potentate, 
or State other than their own,” and it asked that 
the Court declare null the Georgia Acts of 1828 and 
1829 and enjoin the Georgia officials from interfer- 
ing with Cherokee lands, mines, and other prop- 
erty, or with the persons of Cherokees on account 
of anything done by them within the Cherokee 
territory. The Indians were represented before 
the Court by two attorneys, one of them being 
William Wirt; Georgia employed no counsel. The
-P-A-G-E-214
Trxx; SOUTHERN INDIANS 21i 
opinion of the Court as announced at the January 
term, 1831, by Chief Justice Marshall was that 
while the Cherokee nation was a State and had 
uniformly been dealt with as such by the Federal 
Government since 1789, it was not a “foreign 
State” within the meaning of the Constitution, 
and therefore was not entitled to sue in that char- 
acter in the courts of the United States. “‘If it be 
true,” the decision concluded, “that wrongs have 
been inflicted and that still greater are to be appre- 
hended, this is not the tribunal which can redress 
the past or prevent the future. The motion for an 
injunction is denied.” 
The case was thus thrown out of court. Yet the 
Cherokees were recognized as a “‘domestic, depend- 
ent” nation, and there was nothing in the decision 
to indicate that the extension of the laws of Geor- 
gia over them was valid and constitutional. In- 
deed, in a second case that came up shortly, 
Worcester vs. State of Georgia, the Court strongly 
backed up the Indians’ contention. Worcester was 
a Presbyterian missionary who was imprisoned for 
violation of a Georgia statute forbidding white 
persons to reside in the Cherokee territory without 
alicense. The case was appealed to the Supreme 
Court, and in the decision of March 10, 1832,
-P-A-G-E-215
212 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Marshall affirmed the status of the Cherokees as 
a “nation” within whose territory “the laws of 
Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens 
of Georgia have no right to enter but with the 
assent of the Cherokees themselves or in con- 
formity with treaties and with the acts of Con- 
gress.” The statute was accordingly declared to 
be unconstitutional and Worcester was ordered to 
be discharged. 
This ought to have been enough to protect the 
Cherokees in their rights. But it was not, and 
for two reasons: the contempt of Georgia for the 
Court’s opinions, and the refusal of Jackson to 
restrain the State in its headstrong course. Al- 
ready the state authorities had refused to take 
notice of a writ of error to the Supreme Court 
sued out in December, 1830, in behalf of a con- 
demned Cherokee, Corn Tassel, and had per- 
mitted the execution of the unfortunate redskin. 
The state court now refused to issue a writ of 
habeas corpus in behalf of Worcester, and the 
prisoner was held — precisely as if the law under 
which he was convicted had been pronounced 
constitutional — until he was pardoned by the 
Governor a year later. 
This action on the part of the State was, of
-P-A-G-E-216
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 213 
course, nothing less than nullification. Yet Jack- 
son did not lift a finger. ‘‘John Marshall has made 
his decision,”’ he is reported to have said; ‘now 
let him enforce it.” The South Carolinians were 
quick to seize upon the inconsistencies of the situa- 
tion. Nullification in their State was apparently 
one thing; in Georgia, quite another. The very 
fact, however, that the Georgians had successfully 
defied the federal Supreme Court did much to 
encourage their neighbors in a course of similar 
boldness. Jackson’s leniency toward Georgia has 
never been wholly explained. He was undoubtedly 
influenced by his sympathy with the purpose of the 
State to establish its jurisdiction over all Jands 
within its borders. Furthermore he cherished 
an antipathy for Marshall which even led him to 
refuse in 1835 to attend a memorial meeting in the 
great jurist’s honor. But these considerations do 
not wholly cover the case. All that the historian 
can say is that the President chose to take notice 
of the threats and acts of South Carolina and to 
ignore the threats and acts of Georgia, without ever 
being troubled by the inconsistency of his course. 
His political career affords many such illustra- 
tions of the arbitrary and even erratic character 
of his mind.
-P-A-G-E-217
214 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Meanwhile the great Indian migration was set- 
ting in. Emulating the example of Georgia, Ala- 
bama and Mississippi extended their laws over 
all of the Indian lands within their boundaries; 
and in all parts of the South the red folk — some 
of them joyously, but most of them sorrowfully — 
prepared to take up their long journey. In 1832 
the Creeks yielded to the United States all of their 
remaining lands east of the Mississippi. By the 
spring of 1833 the Choctaws and Chickasaws had 
done the same thing and were on their way west- 
ward. Only the Cherokees remained, and in his 
message of December 3, 1833, Jackson reiterated 
his earlier arguments for their removal. Realizing 
that further resistance was useless, a portion of the 
tribe signified its readiness to go. The remainder, 
however, held out, and it was only at the close of 
1835 that the long-desired treaty of cession could 
be secured. All Cherokee lands east of the Mis- 
sissippi were now relinquished to the United States, 
which agreed to pay five million dollars for them, 
to provide an adequate home in the new Indian 
Territory created by Congress during the preced- 
ing year, and to bear all the costs of removing the 
tribe thither. 
It was not alone the South, however, that
-P-A-G-E-218
THE SOUTHERN INDIANS 215 
witnessed widespread displacements of Indian pop- 
ulations in the Jacksonian period. How the Black 
Hawk War of 1832 grew out of, and in turn led 
to, removals in the remoter Northwest has been 
related in another volume in this series. And, 
in almost every western State, surviving Indian 
titles were rapidly extinguished. Between 1829 
and 1837 ninety-four Indian treaties, most of them 
providing for transfers of territory, were con- 
cluded; and before Jackson went out of office 
he was able to report to Congress that, ‘“‘with the 
exception of two small bands living in Ohio and 
Indiana, not exceeding fifteen hundred persons, 
and of the Cherokees, all of the tribes on the east 
side of the Mississippi, and extending from Lake 
Michigan to Florida, have entered into engage- 
ments which will lead to their transplantation.” 
With little delay the Cherokees, too, were added 
to this list, although a group of irreconcilables 
resisted until 1838, when they were forcibly 
ejected by a contingent of United States troops 
under General Winfield Scott. 
All of this was done not without strong protest 
from other people besides the Indians. Some who 
%See The Old Northwest, by Frederic Austin Ogg (in The Chron 
teles of America).
-P-A-G-E-219
216 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
objected did so for political effect. When Clay 
and Calhoun, for example, thundered in the Sen- 
ate against the removal treaties, they were merely 
seeking to discredit the Administration; both held 
views on Indian policy which were substantially 
the same as Jackson’s. But there was also ob- 
jection on humanitarian grounds; and the Society 
of Friends and other religious bodies engaged in 
converting and educating the southern tribes used 
all possible influence to defeat the plan of removal. 
On the whole, however, the country approved 
what was being done. People felt that the further 
presence of large, organized bodies of natives in the 
midst of a rapidly growing white population, and of 
tribes setting themselves up as quasi-independent 
nations within the bounds of the States, was an 
anomaly that could not last; and they considered 
that, distressing as were many features of the 
removals, both white man and red man would 
ultimately be better off.

CHAPTER XI 
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 
“On, hang General Jackson,” exclaimed Fanny 
Kemble one day, after dinner, in the cabin of the 
ship that brought her, in the summer of 1832, to 
the United States. Even before she set foot on 
our shores, the brilliant English actress was tired 
of the din of politics and bored by the incessant 
repetition of the President’s name. Subsequently 
she was presented at the White House and had 
an opportunity to form her own opinion of the 
“monarch” whose name and deeds were on every- 
body’s lips; and the impression was by no means 
unfavorable. “Very tall and thin he was,” says 
her journal, “but erect and dignified; a good speci- 
men of a fine old, well-battered soldier; his man- 
ners perfectly simple and quiet, and, therefore, 
very good.” 
Small wonder that the name of Jackson was 
heard wherever men and women congregated in

218 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
1832! Something more than half of the people of 
the country were at the moment trying to elect the 
General to a second term as President, and some- 
thing less than half were putting forth their best 
efforts to prevent such a “calamity.”’ Three years 
of Jacksonian rule had seen the civil service revo- 
lutionized, the Cabinet banished from its tradi- 
tional place in the governmental system, and the 
conduct of the executive branch given a wholly 
new character and bent. Internal improvements 
had been checked by the Maysville Road veto. 
The United States Bank had been given a blow, 
through another veto, which sent it staggering. 
Political fortunes had been made and unmade by 
a wave of the President’s hand. The first attempt 
of a State to put the stability of the Union to 
the test had brought the Chief Executive dramat- 
ically into the réle of defender of the nation’s 
dignity and perpetuity. No previous President 
had so frequently challenged the attention of the 
public; none had kept himself more continuously 
in the forefront of political controversy. 
Frail health and close application to official 
duties prevented Jackson from traveling exten- 
sively during his eight years in the White House. 
He saw the Hermitage but once in this time, and
-P-A-G-E-222
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 219 
on but one occasion did he venture far from the 
capital. This was in the summer of 1833, when he 
toured the Middle States and New England north- 
ward as far as Concord, New Hampshire. Ac- 
companied by Van Buren, Lewis Cass, Levi Wood- 
bury, and other men of prominence, the President 
set off from Washington in early June. At Balti- 
more, Philadelphia, New York, and intervening 
cities the party was received with all possible 
demonstrations of regard. Processions moved 
through crowded streets; artillery thundered sa- 
lutes; banquet followed banquet; the enthusiasm 
of the masses was unrestrained. At New York 
the furnishings of the hotel suite occupied by the 
President were eventually auctioned off as memen- 
toes of the occasion. 
New England was, in the main, enemy country. 
None the less, the President was received there 
with unstinted goodwill, Edward Everctt said 
that only two other men had ever been welcomed 
in Boston as Jackson was. They were Washing- 
ton and La Fayette. The President’s determined 
stand against nullification was fresh in mind, and 
the people, regardless of party, were not slow to 
express their appreciation. Their cordiality was 
fully reciprocated. “He is amazingly tickled i
-P-A-G-E-223
220 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
with the Yankees,” reports a fellow traveler more 
noted for veracity than for elegance of speech, 
“‘and the more he sees on ’em, the better he likes 
’em. ‘No nullification here,’ says he. ‘No,’ 
says I, ‘General; Mr. Calhoun would stand no 
more chance down east than a stumped-tail bull 
in fly time.’” 
To the infinite disgust of John Quincy Adams, 
Harvard University conferred upon the distin- 
guished visitor the honorary degree of doctor of 
laws. In the course of the ceremony one of the 
seniors delivered, in Latin, a salutatory concluding 
with the words: “Harvard welcomes Jackson the 
President. She embraces Jackson the Patriot.” 
“A splendid compliment, sir, a splendid compli- 
ment,” declared the honored guest after Woodbury 
had translated the phrases for his benefit; “but 
why talk about so live a thing as patriotism in a 
dead language?” At the close of the exercises 
the students filed past the President and were in- 
troduced to him, each greeting him, “to the infinite 
edification and amusement of the grizzly old war- 
rior,” by his new title Doctor Jackson. The wits 
of the opposition lost no opportunity to poke fun 
at the President’s accession to the brotherhood of 
scholars. As he was closing a speech some days
-P-A-G-E-224
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 221 
later an auditor called out, “You must give them 
a little Latin, Doctor.” In nowise abashed, the 
President solemnly doffed his hat again, stepped 
to the front of the platform, and resumed: “EF 
pluribus unum, my friends, sine qua non!” 
Life at the White House, as one writer has re- 
marked, lost under Jackson something of the good 
form of the Virginia régime, but it lost nothing 
of the air of domesticity. Throughout the two 
Administrations the mistress of the mansion was 
Mrs. Andrew Jackson Donelson, wife of the Presi- 
dent’s secretary and in every respect a very ca- 
pable woman. Of formality there was little or none. 
MajorLewis was a member of the presidential house- 
hold, and other intimates — Van Buren, Kendall, 
Blair, Hill dropped in at any time, “before break- 
fast, or in the evening, as inclination prompted.” 
The President was always accessible to callers, 
whether or not their business was important. Yet 
he found much time, especially in the evenings, for 
the enjoyment of his long reed pipe with red clay 
bowl, in the intimacy of the White House living 
room, with perhaps a Cabinet officer to read dis- 
patches or other state papers to him in a corner, 
while the ladies sewed and chatted and half a 
dozen children played about the room.
-P-A-G-E-225
222 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Social affairs there were, of course. But they 
were simple enough to please the most ardent 
Jeffersonian — much too simple to please people 
accustomed to somewhat rigorous etiquette. Thus 
George Bancroft, who had the reputation of being 
one of Washington’s most punctilious gentlemen, 
thought well of Jackson’s character but very poorly 
of his levees. In describing a White House recep- 
tion which he attended in 1831, he wrote: 
The old man stood in the center of a little circle, about 
large enough for a cotillion, and shook hands with every- 
body that offered. The number of ladies who attended 
was small; nor were they brilliant. But to compensate 
for it there was a throng of apprentices, boys of all ages, 
men not civilized enough to walk about the room with 
their hats off; the vilest promiscuous medley that ever 
was congregated in a decent house; many of the lowest 
gathering round the doors, pouncing with avidity upon 
the wine and refreshments, tearing the cake with the 
ravenous keenness of intense hunger; starvelings, and 
fellows with dirty faces and dirty manners; all the refuse 
that Washington could turn forth from its workshops 
and stables. 
The “people” still ruled. Yet it was only the 
public receptions that presented such scenes of dis- 
order. The dinners which the President occasion- 
ally gave were well appointed. A Philadelphia
-P-A-G-E-226
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 223 
gentleman who was once invited to the White 
House with two or three friends testifies that “the 
dinner was very neat and served in excellent taste, 
while the wines were of the choicest qualities. The 
President himself dined on the simplest fare: bread, 
milk, and vegetables.” 
Jackson was never a rich man, and throughout 
his stay in the White House he found it no easy 
matter to make ends meet. He entertained his 
personal friends and official guests royally. He 
lavished hospitality upon the general public, some- 
times spending as much as a thousand or fifteen 
hundred dollars on a single levee. He drew a sharp 
line between personal and public expenditures, and 
met out of his own pocket outlays that under ad- 
ministrations both before and after were charged 
to the public account. He loaned many thousands 
of dollars, in small amounts, to needy friends, to 
old comrades in arms, and especially to widows and 
orphans of his soldiery and of his political support- 
ers; and a large proportion of these debts he not 
only never collected but actually forgot. Receipts 
from the Hermitage farm during his years of ab- 
sence were small, and fire in 1834 made necessary 
a rebuilding of the family residence at consider- 
able cost. The upshot was that when, in 1837, the
-P-A-G-E-227
224 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
General was preparing to leave Washington, he had 
to scrape together every available dollar in cash, 
and in addition pledge the cotton crop of his plan- 
tation six months ahead for a loan of six thousand 
dollars, in order to pay the bills outstanding against 
him in the capital. 
Meanwhile the country came to the election of 
1836. From the time of Van Buren’s withdrawal 
from the Cabinet in 1831 to become, with Jack- 
son’s full approval, a candidate for the vice presi- 
dency, there never was doubt that the New Yorker 
would be the Democratic presidential nominee in 
1836, or that his election would mean a continua- 
tion, in most respects, of the Jacksonian régime. 
Never did a President more clearly pick his succes- 
sor. There was, of course, some protest within the 
party. Van Buren was not popular, and it required 
all of the personal and official influence that the 
President could bring to bear, backed up by judi- 
cious use of the patronage, to carry his program 
through. At that, his own State rebelled and, 
through a resolution of the Legislature, put itself 
behind the candidacy of Senator Hugh L. White. 
The bold actions of his second Administration, de- 
fiant alike of precedent and opposition, had alien- 
ated many of the President’s more intelligent and
-P-A-G-E-228
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 225 
conservative followers. Yet the allegiance of the 
masses was unshaken; and when the Democratic 
convention assembled at Baltimore in May, 1835, 
—a year and a half before the election — the 
nomination of Van Buren was secured without a 
dissenting vote. There was no need to adopt a 
platform; everybody understood that Jackson’s 
policies were the platform, and that Jackson him- 
self was as truly before the electorate as if he had 
been a candidate for a third term. In his letter 
of acceptance Van Buren met all expectations by 
declaring his purpose “‘to tread generally in the 
footsteps of President Jackson.” 
The anti-Administration forces entered the cam- 
paign with no flattering prospects. Since 1832 
their opposition to “executive usurpation” had won 
for them a new party name, “Whig.” But neither 
their opposition nor any other circumstance had 
given them party solidarity. National Republi- 
cans, anti-Masons, converted Jacksonians, state 
rights men —- upon what broad and constructive 
platform could they hope to unite? They had no 
lack of able presidential aspirants. There was 
Clay, the National Republican candidate in 1832; 
there was Webster, of whom Jackson once said 
that he would never be President because he was 
1s
-P-A-G-E-229
226 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
“too far east, knows too much, and is too honest’; 
and there were lesser lights, such as Judge John 
McLean. But, again, how could the many dis- 
cordant groups be rallied to the support of any 
single leader? 
Jackson predicted in 1834 that his opponents 
would nominate William Henry Harrison, because 
“they have got to take up a soldier; they have tried 
orators enough.”’ The prophecy was a shrewd one, 
and in 1840 it was fulfilled to the letter. Upon the 
present occasion, however, the leaders decided to 
place no single nominee in the field, but rather to 
bring forward a number of candidates who could be 
expected to develop local strength and so to split 
the vote as to throw the final choice into the House 
of Representatives. This seemed the only hope of 
circumventing Van Buren’s election. Four sec- 
tional candidates entered the race: Webster was 
backed by New England; the Northwest united 
on Harrison; the Southwest joined the Tennessee 
revolters in support of White; Ohio had her own 
candidate in the person of McLean. 
The plan was ingenious, but it did not work. 
Van Buren received 170 electoral votes against 124 
in spite of his opponents. He carried fifteen of the 
twenty-six States, including four in New England.
-P-A-G-E-230
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 227 
Harrison received 73 votes, White 26 (including 
those of Tennessee), and Webster 14. South Caro- 
lina refused to support any of the candidates on 
either side and threw away her votes on W. P. 
Mangum of North Carolina. The Democrats kept 
control of both branches of Congress. 
Victory, therefore, rested with the Jacksonians 
— which means with Jackson himself. The Demo- 
crats would have control of both the executive and 
legislative branches of the Government for some 
years to come; the Bank would not soon be re- 
chartered; the veto power would remain intact; 
federal expenditure upon internal improvements 
had been curbed, and the “ American system” had 
been checked; the national debt was discharged 
and revenue was superabundant; Jackson could 
look back over the record of his Administrations 
with pride and forward to the rule of “Little Van” 
with satisfaction. ‘“‘When I review the arduous 
administration through which I have passed,” de- 
clared the President soon after the results of the 
election were made known, “the formidable opposi- 
tion, to its very close, of the combined talents, 
wealth, and power of the whole aristocracy of the 
United States, aided as it is by the moneyed monop- 
dlies of the whole country with their corrupting
-P-A-G-E-231
228 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
influence, with which we had to contend, I am truly 
thankful to my God for this happy result.” 
Congress met on the 5th of December for the 
closing session of the Administration. The note 
of victory pervaded the President’s message. Yet 
there was one more triumph to be won: the resolu- 
tion of censure voted by the Senate in 1834 was 
still officially on the record book. Now it was that 
Benton finally procured the passage of his expung- 
ing resolution, although not until both branches of 
Congress had been dragged into controversy more 
personal and acrid, if possible, than any in the past 
eight years. The action taken was probably un- 
constitutional. But Jackson’s “honor” was vin- 
dicated, and that was all that he and his friends 
saw, or cared to see, in the proceeding. 
As early as 1831 the President conceived the idea 
of issuing a farewell address to the people upon the 
eve of his retirement; and a few weeks before the 
election of Van Buren he sent to Taney a list of 
subjects which he proposed to touch upon in the 
document, requesting him to “throw on paper” his 
ideas concerning them. The address was issued on 
March 4, 1837, and followed closely the copy sub- 
sequently found in Taney’s handwriting in the Jack- 
son manuscripts. Its contents were thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-232
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 229 
commonplace, being indeed hardly more than 
a résumé of the eight annual messages; and it 
might well have been dismissed as the amiable 
musings of a garrulous old man. But nothing asso- 
ciated with the name of Jackson ever failed to stir 
controversy. The Whigs ridiculed the egotism 
which underlay the palpable imitation of Washing- 
ton. “Happily,” said the New York American, 
“it is the last humbug which the mischievous 
popularity of this illiterate, violent, vain, and 
iron-willed soldier can impose upon a confiding 
and credulous people.” The Democrats, however, 
lauded the address, praised the wisdom and sin- 
eerity of its author, and laid away among their 
most valued mementoes the white satin copies 
which admiring friends scattered broadcast over 
the country. 
Showered with evidences of undiminished popu- 
larity, the General came down to his last day in 
office. One enthusiast sent him a light wagon 
made entirely of hickory sticks with the bark upon 
them. Another presented a phaeton made of wood 
taken from the old frigate Constitution. A third 
capped the climax by forwarding from New York 
a cheese four feet in diameter, two feet thick, and 
weighing fourteen hundred pounds — twice as
-P-A-G-E-233
230 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
large, the Globe fondly pointed out, as the cheese 
presented to Jefferson under similar circumstances 
a quarter of a century earlier. From all parts of 
the country came callers, singly and in delegations, 
to pay their respects and to assure the outgoing 
Chief of their goodwill and admiration. March 
4, 1837, was a raw, disagreeable day. But Jackson, 
pale and racked by disease, rode with his chosen 
successor to the place where he had himself as- 
sumed office eight years before, and sat uncovered 
while the oath was administered and the inaugural 
delivered. The suave, elegantly dressed Van Bu- 
ren was politely applauded as the new Chief to 
whom respect was due. But it was the tall, hag- 
gard, white-haired soldier-politician who had put 
Van Buren where he was who awoke the spontane- 
ous enthusiasm of the crowds. 
Three days after the inauguration Jackson 
started for the Hermitage. His trip became a se- 
ties of ovations, and he was obliged several times 
to pause for rest. At last he reached Nashville, 
where once again, as in the old days of the Indian 
wars, he was received with an acclaim deeply tinged 
by personal friendship and neighborly pride. A 
great banquet in his honor was presided over by 
James K. Polk, now Speaker of the national House
-P-A-G-E-234
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 231 
of Representatives; and the orators vied one with 
another in extolling his virtues and depicting his 
services to the country. Then Jackson went on to 
the homestead whose seclusion he coveted. 
No one knew better than the ex-President him- 
self that his course was almost run. He was sev- 
enty years of age and seldom free from pain for 
an hour. He considered himself, moreover, a poor 
man — mainly, it appears, because he went back 
to Tennessee owing ten thousand dollars and with 
only ninety dollars in his pockets. He was, how- 
ever, only “land poor,” for his plantation of 
twenty-six hundred acres was rich and valua- 
ble, and he had a hundred and forty slaves — 
“servants” he always called them — besides large 
numbers of horses and cattle. A year or two of 
thrifty supervision brought his lands and herds 
back to liberal yields; his debts were soon paid off; 
and notwithstanding heavy outlays for his adopted 
son, whose investments invariably turned out 
badly, he was soon able to put aside all anxiety 
over pecuniary matters. 
Established again in his old home, surrounded by 
congenial relatives and friends, respected by neigh- 
bors without regard to politics, and visited from 
time to time by notable foreigners and Americans,
-P-A-G-E-235
232 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
Jackson found much of satisfaction in his declin- 
ing years. For a time he fully lived up to the 
promise made to Benton and Blair that he would 
keep clear of politics. His interest in the fortunes 
of his party, however, was not diminished by his 
retirement from public life. He corresponded 
freely with Van Buren, whose policies he in most 
respects approved; and as the campaign of 1840 
approached the “old war-horse began once more 
to sniff the battle from afar.” Admitting to his 
friends that the situation looked “a little dubious,” 
he exerted himself powerfully to bring about the 
reélection of the New Yorker. He wrote a letter 
belittling the military qualities of the Whig can- 
didate, thereby probably doing the Democratic 
cause more harm than good; and finally, to avert 
the humiliation of a Whig victory in Tennessee, 
he “‘took the stump” and denounced the enemy 
up and down through all western Tennessee and 
southern Kentucky. But “Tippecanoe and Tyler 
too” was too much for him; the Whig candidates 
carried both Tennessee and Kentucky and won the 
nation-wide contest by 234 to 60 electoral votes. 
The old warrior took the defeat — his defeat, he 
always regarded it — philosophically, and at once 
began to lay plans for a recovery of Democratir

supremacy in 1844. For another quadrennium his 
hand was on the party throttle. When men specu- 
lated as to whether Van Buren, General Cass, 
General Butler, or Senator Benton would be the 
standard bearer in 1844, they always asked what 
Jackson’s edict on the subject would be; and the 
final selection of James K. Polk, while not fully 
dictated by the ex-President, was the result of a 
compromise in which his advice played a prom- 
inent part. Though past seventy-seven and hard- 
ly able to sign his name, Jackson threw himself 
into the campaign and undoubtedly contributed to 
the election of his fellow-Tennesseean. His satis- 
faction with the outcome and with the annexation 
of Texas which quickly followed found expression 
in a barbecue attended by all the Democrats of the 
neighborhood and by some of note from a distance. 
“We have restored the Government to sound 
principles,” declared the host in a brief, faltering 
speech from the Hermitage portico, “and extended 
the area of our institutions to the Rio Grande. 
Now for Oregon and Fifty-four-forty.” 
Oregon — although not to fifty-four forty — 
was soon to be duly made American soil. But 
Jackson did not live to witness the event. Early in 
1845 his health began to fail rapidly and on the
-P-A-G-E-237
234 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
very day of Polk’s inauguration he was at the 
point of death. Rallying, he struggled manfully 
for three months against the combined effects of 
consumption, dropsy, and dysentery. But on Sun- 
day, the 8th of June, the end came. In accordance 
with a pledge which he had given his wife years 
before, he had become a communicant of the Pres- 
byterian church; and his last words to the friends 
about his bedside were messages of Christian cheer. 
After two days the body was laid to rest in the 
Hermitage garden, beside the grave of the com- 
panion whose loss he had never ceased to mourn 
with all the feeling of which his great nature was 
capable. The authorities at the national capital 
ordered public honors to be paid to the ex-President, 
and gatherings in all parts of the country listened 
with much show of feeling to appropriate eulogies. 
“General Jackson,” said Daniel Webster to 
Thurlow Weed in 1837, “is an honest and upright 
man. He does what he thinks is right, and does it 
with all his might. He has a violent temper, which 
leads him often to hasty conclusions. It also 
causes him to view as personal to himself the public 
acts of other men. For this reason there is great 
difference between Jackson angry and Jackson in
-P-A-G-E-238
THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION 985 
good humor. When he is calm, his judgment is 
good; when angry, it is usually bad... . His 
patriotism is no more to be questioned than that of 
Washington. He is the greatest General we have 
and, except Washington, the greatest we ever had.” 
To this characterization of Andrew Jackson by 
his greatest American contemporary it is impossible 
to make noteworthy addition. His was a charac- 
ter of striking contradictions. His personal virtues 
were honesty, bravery, open-heartedness, chivalry 
toward women, hospitality, steadfastness. His 
personal faults were irascibility, egotism, stubborn- 
ness, vindictiveness, and intolerance of the opin- 
ions of others. He was not a statesman; yet some 
of the highest qualities of statesmanship were in 
him. He had a perception of the public will which 
has rarely been surpassed; and in most, if not all, of 
the great issues of his time he had a grasp of the 
right end of the question. 
The country came to the belief that the National 
Bank should not be revived. It accepted and per- 
petuated Van Buren’s independent treasury plan. 
The annexation of Texas, which Jackson strongly 
favored, became an accomplished fact with the 
approval of a majority of the people. The moder- 
ated protective tariff to which Jackson inclined
-P-A-G-E-239
236 THE REIGN OF ANDREW JACKSON 
was kept up until the Civil War. The removal of 
the Indians to reservations beyond the Mississippi 
fell in with the views of the public upon that sub- 
ject and inaugurated an Indian policy which was 
closely adhered to for more than half a century. 
Tn his vindication of executive independence Jack- 
son broke new ground, crudely enough it is true; 
yet, whatever the merits of his ideas at the moment, 
they reshaped men’s conception of the presidency 
and helped make that office the power that it is to- 
day. The strong stand taken against nullification 
clarified popular opinion upon the nature of the 
Union and lent new and powerful support to 
national vigor and dignity. 
Over against these achievements must be placed 
the introduction of the Spoils System, which de- 
bauched the Civil Service and did the country 
. lasting harm; yet Jackson only responded to public 
opinion which held “‘rotation in office to be the 
cardinal principle of democracy.”’ It needed a half- 
century of experience to convince the American 
people of this fallacy and to place the national 
Civil Service beyond the reach of spoilsmen. Even 
now public opinion is slow to realize that efficiency 
in office can be secured only by experience and 
relative permanence.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE 
Tuer events of the period covered in this volume are 
described with some fullness in all of the general Ameri- 
can histories. Of these, two are especially noteworthy 
for literary quality and other elements of popular in- 
terest: Woodrow Wilson’s History of the American People, 
5 vols. (1902), and John B. McMaster’s History of the 
People of the United States, 8 vols. (1883-1913). The 
Jacksonian epoch is treated in Wilson’s fourth volume 
and in McMaster’s fifth and sixth volumes. On similar 
lines, but with more emphasis on political and constitu- 
tional matters, is James Schouler’s History of the United 
States under the Constitution, 7 vols. (1880-1913), vols. 
mi-1v. One seeking a scholarly view of the period, 
in an adequate literary setting, can hardly do better, 
however, than to read Frederick J. Turner’s Rise 
of the New West (1906) and William MacDonald’s 
Jacksonian Democracy (1906). These are volumes xiv 
and xv in The American Nation, edited by Albert 
B. Hart. 
Biographies are numerous and in a number of in- 
stances excellent. Of lives of Jackson, upwards of a 
dozen have been published. The most recent and in 
every respect the best is John S. Bassett’s Life of Andrew 
Jackson, 2 vols. (1911). This work is based throughout 
on the sources; its literary quality is above the average; 
237

and it appraises Jackson and his times in an unim- 
peachable spirit of fairness. Within very limited space, 
William G. Brown’s Andrew Jackson (1900) tells the 
story of Jackson admirably; and a good biography, 
marred only by a lack of sympathy and by occasional 
inaccuracy in details, is William G. Sumner’s Andrew 
Jackson (rev. ed., 1899). Of older biographies, the 
most important is James Parton’s Life of Andrew Jack- 
son, 3 vols. (1861). This work is sketchy, full of irrele- 
vant or unimportant matter, and uncritical; but for 
a half-century it was the repository from which his- 
torians and biographers chiefly drew in dealing with 
Jackson’s epoch. John H. Eaton’s Life of Andrew Jack- 
gon (1842) describes Jackson’s earlier career, mainly on 
the military side; but it never rises above the level of 
a campaign document. 
Among biographies of Jackson’s contemporaries may 
be mentioned George T. Curtis, Life of Daniel Webster, 
2 vols, (1870); Henry C. Lodge, Daniel Webster (1883); 
John B. McMaster, Daniel Webster (1902); Frederic A. 
Ogg, Daniel Webster (1914); Carl Schurz, Henry Clay, 
2 vols. (1887); Gaillard Hunt, John C. Calhoun (1908); 
William M. Meigs, The Life of John Caldwell Calhoun, 
2 vols. (1917); John T. Morse, John Quincy Adams 
(1882); Edward M. Shepard, Martin Van Buren (1888); 
Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Hart Benton (1888); and 
Theodore D. Jervey, Robert Y. Hayne and His Times 
(1909). 
On many topics the reader will do well to go to mono- 
graphs or other special works. Thus Jackson’s policy 
of removals from public office is presented with good 
perspective in Carl R. Fish, The Civil Service and the 
Patronage (Harvard Historical Studies, x1, 1905). The
-P-A-G-E-242
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE 239 
history of the bank controversy is best told in Ralph C. 
H. Catterall, The Second Bank of the United States (1903) ; 
and interesting chapters in the country’s financial his- 
tory are presented in Edward G. Bourne, History of the 
Surplus Revenue of 1837 (1885), and David Kinley, The 
History, Organization, and Influence of the Independent 
Treasury of the United States (1893). On the tariff one 
should consult Frank W. Taussig, Tariff History of the 
United Staies (6th ed., 1914) and Edward Stanwood, 
American Tariff Controversies, 2 vols. (1903). Similarly 
illuminating studies of nullification are David F. Hous- 
ton, Critical Study of Nullification in South Carolina 
(Harvard Historical Studies, 11, 1896) and Ulrich B. 
Phillips, Georgia and State Rights (American Historical 
Association Reports, 1901, 1). 
Aside from newspapers, and from collections of public 
documents of private correspondence, which cannot be 
enumerated here, the source materials for the period 
fall into two main classes: books of autobiography and. 
reminiscence, and the writings of travelers. Most con- 
spicuous in the first group is Thomas H. Benton, Thirty 
Years’ View; or, a History of the Working of the American 
Government for Thirty Years, from 1820 to 1850, 2 vols. 
(1854). Benton was an active member of the Senate 
throughout the Jacksonian period, and his book gives 
an interesting and valuable first-hand account of the 
public affairs of the time. Amos Kendall’s Autobiog- 
raphy (1872) is, unfortunately, hardly more than a col- 
lection of papers and scattered memoranda. Nathan 
Sargent’s Public Men and Events, 1817-1853, 2 vols. 
(1875), consists of chatty sketches, with an anti-Jackson 
slant. Other books of contemporary reminiscence are 
Lyman Beecher’s Autobiography, 2 vols. (1863-65):
-P-A-G-E-243
240 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE 
Robert Mayo’s Political Sketches of Eight Years in Wash- 
ington (1839); and S. C. Goodrich’s Recollections of a 
Lifetime, 2 vols. (1856). The one monumental diary is 
John Quincy Adams, Memoirs; Comprising Portions of 
his Diary from 1795 to 1848 (ed. by Charles F. Adams, 
12 vols., 1874-77). All things considered, there is no 
more important nonofficial source for the period. 
In Jackson’s day the United States was visited by 
an extraordinary number of Europeans who forthwith 
wrote books descriptive of what they had seen. Two of 
the most interesting — although the least flattering — 
of these works are Charles Dickens’s American Notes for 
General Circulation (1842, and many reprints) and Mrs. 
Frances E. Trollope’s Domestic Manners of the Ameri- 
cans (1832). Two very readable and generally sym- 
pathetic English accounts are Frances A. Kemble’s 
Journal, 1832-1833, 2 vols. (1835) and Harriet Mar- 
tineau’s Society in America, 3 vols. (2d ed., 1837). The 
principal French work of the sort is M. Chevalier, 
Society, Manners, and Politics in the United States (Eng. 
trans. from 8d French ed., 1839). Political conditions 
in the country are described in Alexis de Tocqueville, 
Democracy in America (Eng. trans. by Reeve in 2 vols., 
1862), and the economic situation is set forth in detail 
in James S. Buckingham, America, Historical, Statistical 
and Descriptive, 2 vols. (1841), and The Slave States of 
America, 2 vols. (1842).

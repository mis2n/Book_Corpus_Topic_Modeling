REPORT. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D.C., June 30, 1883. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit my thirteenth annual report. 
So large a number of systems and institutions of education have been able to bring 
their reports up to the end of June, 1883, that this report is closed at that date. It 
will aid this Office greatly if this date should prove convenient for all those who are 
coworkers with it in the preparation of data included in these annual reports. Se 
far little space has been given to the work of the Office itself. The reports have been 
devoted to the briefest summary of the vast amount of educational data in hand, 
but anything like a full representation of the work of the Office any year would fill 
a volume larger than this. It would contain the latest discussions of a variety of 
topics touching education the world over, based on the latest statistics, in which these 
would appear incidentally only. This part of the work of the Office comes and goes 
with the daily mail. Not infrequently single communications require months of re- 
search, and the results find their way into educational literature and thought and 
action, but are not known to have had any connection with this Office. One division, 
having three clerks, reports fifty-six days devoted to work of this character. 
The communications sent out numbered 30,745 and those received 67,875. At the 
cost of great labor an entire rearrangement of the document division has been effected, 
which adds much to its efficiency. The documents distributed numbered 323,592 and 
were usually mailed in separate packages. _Many of these were sent in response tu 
individual requests. One document was asked for by as many as ten thousand per- 
sons, requiring the writing of as many addresses. This distribution of documents has 
favorably affected many educational methods and appliances. The teachers’ insti- 
tutes have been much more freely supplied than before. Circulars and bulletins were 
sent to 406 institutes held in twenty-three different States. Seventy-eight of these 
teachers’ gatherings in a single State were furnished these publications. So far there 
is no means of ascertaining the number of teachers thus supplied with valuable in- 
formation. 
The following circulars of information have been printed and distributed since the 
enumeration in the previous report : 
No. 1, 1882. The inception, organization, and management of training schools for 
nurses. 28 pp. 
No. 2, 1882. Proceedings of the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Educational Association at its meeting at Washington, March 21-23, 1882. 112 pp. 
No. 3, 1882. The University of Bonn. 67 pp. 
No. 4, 1882. Industrial art in schools, by Charles G, Leland, of Philadelphia. 37 pp. No. 5, 1882. Maternal schools in France. 14 pp. 
No. 6, 1882. Technical instruction in France. 63 pp. 
Rot 1883. Legal provisions respecting the examination and licensing of teach- 
ers. 46 pp. 
No. 2, 1883. Coeducation of the sexes in the public schools of the United States.   
0 pp. 
No. 3, 1883. Proceedings of the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Educational Association at its meeting at Washington, February 20-22, 1883. 31 pp. 
The following bulletins have also been issued : 
Instruction in morals and civil government. 4 pp. 
National Pedagogic Congress of Spain. 4 pp. 
Natural science in secondary schools. 9 pp.

In addition to these publications a special report of three hundred and nineteen 
pages on ‘ Industrial Education in the United States”! was prepared and printed in 
compliance with a resolution of the Senate. 
The number of copies of each circular or bulletin issued has been increased to sup- 
ply the correspondents of the Office, and several of those most in demand have been 
reprinted.

It will be seen from the above table how steady has been the increase of the num- 
ber of persons voluntarily furnishing the statistics for this annual report. Very many 
others not at the head of any system or institution of education have furnished valu- 
able data for the use of the Office. This annual report is the result of information 
systematically but gratuitously supplied by more than ten thousand correspondents. 
In the preparation of the statistical tables in the appendix of this volume, blanks 
carefully prepared, generally after conference with representatives of those to whom 
  
See p. clii.

THE OFFICE LIBRARY. VII 
they are to be addressed, are sent out. These blanks are filled as far as found to be 
expedient by the head of each system or institution addressed. When received in the 
Office they are sent to the statistical division; there the data furnished are drawn off 
upon large sheets to correspond in headings and form with those thus filled by the 
respective educational officers, and this form of copy is used by the printer. 
It is gratifying to know that this voluntary system of statistics is constantly im- 
proving in completeness and exactness. The only return this Office is able to make 
for all this great labor among its friends is to supply them with its publications. It 
is clear that all of those who have thus contributed to the report should in equity be 
farnished a copy of the document. Moreover, it should be noted that an additional 
number is needed to supply requests from writers, teachers, professors, school officers, 
the press, public libraries, and other worthy sources of aid. There should be printed 
of the report not less than 20,000 extra copies for distribution by the Office. 
This system of voluntary statistical information, instituted and carried forward by 
these colaborers so widely scattered, is believed to be the most complete of the kind 
in existence, and shows that the objects and methods as well as the publications of 
the Office are very acceptable to the educators of the country. The usefulness of the 
Office is of course chiefly determined by the benefit to be derived by the people from 
its publications. These should, therefore, contain information not only about what- 
ever of good or ill oceurs in the experience of our own people, but also about what is 
happening or observed abroad, and particularly as to the results of all scientific and 
careful investigations respecting matters concerning the nurture, education, and train- 
ing of the young for the best performance of their duties as the citizens of the future. 
So far as the limited funds at the disposal of the Office have allowed, I have sought to 
secure the results of these labors, domestic and foreign; but those requiring the ex- 
penditure of any considerable amount of money have been practically beyond my 
power for lack of means. The salaried assistants in the Office are not able to do all 
the work required by the Office in its various relations to the public and the fandsnow 
appropriated and available for outside help amount only to $2,200. 
THE LIBRARY. 
The provisions of the statute establishing this Office and expressing its general 
duties have always been present to my mind when considering and choosing methods 
for accomplishing the results desired. The collection of “statistics and facts showing 
the condition and progress of education in the several States and Territories” is one 
of the duties mentioned in this law, and the due performance of it makes the collee- 
tion and care of a library containing the educational reports, pamphlets, catalogues, 
school journals, and other pedagogic publications of the whole country one of the first 
necessities of such an office. The statute also provides that the Bureau is to diffuse 
“information respecting the organization and management of schools, school systems, 
and methods of teaching” of such character as may promote ‘ the establishment and 
maintenance of efficient school systems,” as well as ‘the cause of education” in gen- 
eral. These provisions of the law, brief and without much detail as they are, cannot 
be carried out without collecting printed matter, foreign and domestic, respecting the 
theory as well as the practice and results of pedagogics. Nor, since the school in 
modern society has been modified or amplified in numerous ways to produce numerous 
results never demanded of it in earlier times, has it been possible to comprehend or 
to exhibit the nature, functions, and problems of modern education without some col- 
lateral knowledge and study of other social and educational forees. Thus, applying 
the approved and universal rules of modern scientific research to the fulfilment of this 
official duty, it was necessary to include enough material in the scheme of the Office 
library to enable those using it to study, historically and comparatively, the develop- 
ment and the environment of education as a whole,

work; the ‘‘ statistics and facts showing the condition and progress of education in

the several States and Territories,” annually collected and compiled, constitute the 
greater part of the yearly reports of this Office transmitted to Congress like other ex- 
ecutive documents. To prepare these reports it became necessary to establish a regu- 
lar exchange of documents with all State and local educational centres that published 
them. The yearly publications of this kind in the Union number several thousand, 
most of them published in small editions only ; if not obtained soon after publication, 
copies disappear into public or private libraries and the edition becomes exhausted. 
The library, since 1870, has gathered these documents, reports, bulletins, catalogues, 
circulars, announcements, programs, &c., and has preserved them carefully. In addi- 
tion copies of earlier editions or series have been sedulously sought and obtained, 
never at great expense of money, but often by much expenditure of time and manage- 
ment. In this way the collection of State reports, city reports, college catalogues 
and publications, academy catalogues, and programs and circulars of professional 
and special schools now in the possession of this library is far superior, in quantity, 
quality, and interest, to any other general collection in the world, and in most cases 
more complete than the series belonging to the offices and institutions in correspond- 
ence with the Bureau. Unlike most libraries, this part of the library of the Bureau is 
arranged, shelved, and indexed geographically as well as topically, so that any docu- 
ment in its possession can always be found in the same relative place and consulted 
without loss of time whenever required. This system, originating like the library 
itself from the necessities of the work to be done, has been more than a dozen years in 
successful use and has proved entirely capable of successive enlargement and sub- 
division without causing loss, confusion, or delay. Indeed, since the annual reports 
of this Office from 1870 to the present time arrange the facts and statistics contained 
in them in accordance with the same geographical and topical system, these reports, 
in addition to their public use, may be considered as classified subject indexes of the annual 
accessions to the library. 
Another part of the collection, which began also in necessity, has now assumed an 
important and valuable position, viz, the periodical literature of American education. 
The value of such publications, as preserving the very ‘age and body of the time” 
in which they appear and recording countless facts, opinions, names, and dates that 
would otherwise be lost beyond recall, is conceded in all other branches of study and 
must, of necessity, be allowed in this subject also, By exchange, subscription, pur- 
chase, and gift, the library now possesses and is daily adding to a collection really 
unique in the world; by no means complete, for there are important lacune that 
may never be filled, but, despite these, more full, various, and valuable than that in 
the possession of any corporation or individual. These journals also have been indexed 
by author or title and subject, and this part of the index, if printed (though covering 
a field almost entirely distinct from that occupied by the great Index to Periodical 
Literature! recently reissued by its veteran originator, Dr. William F. Poole, and his 
industrious younger colleague, William I. Fletcher, esq.), would fill a larger book than 
that magnum opus of the librarians. 
The periodicals received are also consulted regularly for facts, allusions, and ideas to 
be used in the annual reports or other publications of the Office. Nor is the daily 
press_overlooked : such newspapers as reach the Office are carefully examined, and 
articles, facts, and opinions of present or possible value are preserved in scrapbooks 
with indexes. 
  
1An Index to Periodical Literature, by William Frederick Poole, tt. D., librarian of the Chicago Pub 
lic Library ; third edition, brought down to January, 1882, with the assistance as associate editor of 
William I. Fletcher, assistant librarian of the Watkinson Library, Hartford, Conn., and the codperation 
of the American Library Association and the Library Association of the United Kingdom. Boston, 
James R. Osgood & Co., 1882, 4°. 28 + 1442=1470 pp. 
It would be improper in a report of this kind to omit mention of a work so long expected, so ably 
done, and so eminently useful as this volume is. The germ of the present work was a pamphlet in- 
dexing the periodicals contained in the library of a literary society of which Dr. Poole was a member 
when a'student at Yale College. Additions to the successive editions of this work have decupled the 
pampblet of 149 pages into the volume now referred to.

THE OFFICE LIBRARY. Ix 
The duty for doing which this Office was established has obliged it to gather, grad- 
ually, foreign reports, catalogues, and educational treatises. The progress of society 
has made an interchange of ideas, usages, and customs between nations as inevitable 
as the exchange of material products. Therefore it has been the practice of this Office 
neither to resist nor to overstimulate this interchange, but to afford to the people of 
this country ar opportunity to make a wise choice of foreign ideas, and to recommend 
toinquirers from other countries only such ideas and usages as might be suitable to the 
other parts of their social structure. By exchange, purchase, and gift the library 
thus possesses a large collection of foreign educational works, nearly every civilized 
country and its colonies being represented. Magazines and journals in the principal 
foreign languages are also procured, in order that there may be no delay in obtaining 
and disseminating useful ideas and facts from these distant sources of information. 
The translator attached to this Office is charged with the custody and management 
of the books and periodicals in foreign languages. This portion of the library will be 
completely catalogued, both by authors and subjects, as soon as the condition of the 
Office will allow ; parts of this catalogue have already been completed. 
One very interesting portion of this foreign collection is that relating to the colo- 
nial possessions of the British monarchy. These dependencies, the present hope and 
future home of many millions of English-speaking people, are following in school 
matters the example of the United States rather than that of the mother country. By 
this channel the most vital and useful features of American life are becoming and 
will hereafter constitute the heritage of new‘nations and peoples yet unborn. 
I have thus described some of the peculiarities of this library and some of the cir- 
cumstances attending its origin and manner of growth. The unostentatious but un- 
ceasing and intelligent labors of Mr, Samuel R. Warren (one of the editors of the 
Special Report on Librariesin the United States) and of Mr. Henderson Presnell (now 
assigned to the custody and management of the collection) should not go unmentioned. 
To their work and care the Office is indebted for much of the convenience and com- 
pleteness of the collection and the library itself for its useful clussification and rapidly 
advancing catalogue. 
Bearing in mind the practical manner in which this library originated and has in- 
creased, the flexible scheme on which it is now enlarging may be stated as compre- 
hending the following subjects: 
A. Antique culture, religious, philosophical, artistic, or industrial, so far as it was 
influential in forming or modify ing the mother countries of our population : e. g., the 
genesis and pr rot religions, and particularly those deriving their primal impulses 
from the Hebrews; the genesis and development of art in Egypt, Chaldo-Assyria, 
Greece, Rome, and modern countries; prehistoric life and industry, particularly with 
reference to the development of useful ideas, implements, and processes among various 
peoples, and the investigation of savage and semi-civilized life, beliefs, and customs ; 
Greek, medieval, and modern philosophy, &e. 
cational theories, methods, and results in those European countries from 
which the mapeleiae of this country is derived: England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, 
Franee, Germany, Sweden, Norway, “Denmark, Spain, and ‘other lands. 
C. The nation and combination of social forces during the colonial period of 
American life; histories, biographies, college PEBSMICRE, town records, and all avail- 
able sources of information. 
D. The history and development of social and edaeandnl forces in the American 
Union — for the ‘earlier years, material similar to that last mentioned, and, for the later 
years, in addition, reports of State and city school officers, school journals, cata- 
logics, text books, &eo. 
Contemporary educational thought and practice in foreign countries, particu- 
tasly the study of new or intrusive phenomena, such as Chinese life and thonght, Mor- 
mon development and tendencies, the growth and influence of pessimism in society, 
the cause and increase of suicide and mental disease ; and other phenomena bearing 
upon the training of the young. 
The library is organized and shelved in accordance with the classification that gov- 
erns the material in my annual reports. It is hoped to have a complete catalogue and 
index of all accessions. The State is taken as a unit,under which the topics are 
arranged alphabetically and chronologically. For the purpose of illustration, under

x REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the State of Michigan the following topics appear alphabetically arranged, or, in 
other words, the topical is here subordinate to the geographical method of arrange- 
ment: 
Michigan: Education, 
History. 
School reports. 
School laws. 
Miscellaneous. 
Want of room, however, prevents the carrying out of the plan in many of its details. 
In the index catalogue, now in preparation, the same plan is substantially carried out 
whenever practicable, but not to the exclusion of the topical method, for the catalogue 
is distinctively educational, and to render that feature prominent it has been found 
necessary to subordinate, in some instances, the geographical to the topical method. 
The files of catalogues, circulars, reports, and prospectuses of colleges and universi- 
ties, schools of science, law, medicine, and theology, schools for the superior education 
of women, normal schools, preparatory and secondary schools, &c., are arranged top- 
ically, so as to correspond to the plan of the statistical tables of the Commissicrer’s 
report. These files embrace the following topics, in alphabetical order: 
Academies and seminaries. 
Art museums. 
Botanical gardens. 
Business colleges. 
City school systems. 
Colleges for women. 
Colleges and universities. 
College entrance examinations, 
Homes for infants. 
Industrial schools. 
Kindergiirten. 
Law schools. 
Libraries. 
Medical schools.

Schools of music. 
Schools of science. 
Schools for the blind. 
Schools for deaf-mutes. 
Schools for the feeble-minded. 
State school systems. 
Theological schools. 
Zodlogical gardens. 
The index catalogue recognizes this arrangement, and each topic will be found in- 
dexed under its initial letter in the alphabetical arrangement. In further illustration 
of the scheme, the entries under the letter E are given.

THE OFFICE LIBRARY. xI 
Thus it will be seen that the object and uses of the library have determined the 
form of its organization and the character of its catalogue and index, and it may 
besuggestive to those undertaking to organize educational libraries elsewhere. 
It should be observed that no one of the great general libraries in the country 
prior to the establishment of this Office had begun to make any considerable collec- 
tion of educational information, nor could such a collection have been brought to- 
gether by ordinary methods of growth. It is largely the result of a well established 
system of exchanges and of contributions, due to the hearty codperation of the officers 
and friends of education at home and abroad. Its value has never been approxi- 
mately represented by the appropriations for its support, which have not exceeded 
$1,000 a year for books and never more than $700 a year for completing sets, journals, 
magazines, &c. The card catalogue of subjects and card catalogue of authors and titles 
above mentioned, as soon as published, will become specially helpful to all educators 
of the country whenever searching educational literature. The publication of this 
catalogue is already earnestly sought, and it is hoped that it can be ere long under- 
taken. The collection now numbers 15,000 volumes and 37,000 pamphlets. 
The question has been raised whether this collection of educational literature could 
not be merged into some general collection, but it should be noted that in many in- 
vestigations it is necessary to gather large numbers of books around the investigator 
and to keep them in hand for a considerable length of time. No one familiar with 
the requirements of thorough research can fail to understand the difficulty of going 
from one point to another to obtain separate books. Of this the Office has had ample 
and unprofitable experience. It is clear that the time of a clerk competent to make 
researches is too valuable to be wasted in running about or waiting or writing notes 
for books. 
It hardly need be said that a question relating to ventilation, to architecture, to 
the organization of State or city systems, or one relating-to methods of instruction, 
or an inquiry as to education and insanity, or education and crime, or education and 
labor will demand in its treatment not merely what comes in the form of current lit- 
erature, but will create a demand for the readiest access to all sources of the desired 
information, 
From the foregoing it is apparent (1) that the Office has never contemplated gath- 
ering a general library, (2) that its library has grown with its growth and is insep- 
arable from its daily duties, and (3) that if the present collection should be withdrawn 
from its own rooms and control the efficiency of the Office would be indescribably’ 
impaired and the value of the collection wellnigh sacrificed. In a large general 
library administration it could hardly fail to be remanded to some out of the way cor- 
ner, where it would be lost to the daily use for which it is intended and which is, 
indeed, the only reason of its existence. It is confidently believed that placing the 
volumes of this collection in any other than the present close relation to the admin- 
istration of the Office would defeat the economical purpose of any such measure. 
Imperfect as the library of this Office is, I have no hesitation in saying that it has 
become indispensable to the rapid and economical transaction of the official business 
of the Bureau.

I   
The reports of the Office give gratifying evidence of the progress towards complete- 
ness in the educational statistics of the country. 
Table I presents statistics of the five items of school population, enrolment, average 
daily attendance, income and expenditure of public schools from all the States and Ter- 
ritories, and a more or less accurate statement of the number of teachers, one Terri- 
tory alone failing to report. Insome instances, as noted in the table, the figures have 
been taken from the United States Census of 1880, and are therefore two years be- 
hind the date of the report, and in a few cases estimates only were attainable. On 
the whole, the figures make a reliable exhibit of the condition of public schools for 
the year. 
The totals under the several headings of the table show increase over the same for .
-P-A-G-E-25
SCHOOL STATISTICS OF STATES AND TERRITORIES. XXV 
1881, which increase, as will be seen by a detailed comparison of the figures in this 
and the preceding report, is well distributed throughout the country. 
School population, enrolment, and average attendance— The total increase in the items 
reported in Table I, Part 1, is as foliows: 
School population: States, 359,958; Territories, 4,358; total, 364,316. 
Enrolment in public schools:' States, 152,107; Territories, 1,386; total increase, 
153,493, 
Average daily attendance:? States, 446,504; Territories, 7,471; total increase, 
453,975. 
If the enrolment in private schools, viz, 567,874, be added to that of public schools, 
10,013,826, we have a total of 10,581,700 youth under instruction in the schools, 
that is, 65 per cent. of the legal schodl population and 21 per cent. of the entire pop- 
ulation as given in the United States Census of 1880. 
Legal school age.—The legal school population, it should be observed, in most States 
is a larger number than would be obtained by the enumeration of the youth in the 
years of the usual period of school attendance. The legal school ages remain the 
same as in 1881, with the following exceptions: In Kentucky the legal school age for 
blacks, formerly 6 to 16, has been made the same as for whites, viz, 6 to 20. In 
Florida the legal school age 6 to 21 has been given in preference to 4 to 21, asin the previ- 
ous report. In this State the interest of the school fund and the proceeds of the 1 mill 
tax are distributed among the several counties upon the basis of the population 4 to 
21 years of age, but the apportionment to the different schools is made upon the basis 
of the average attendance of pupils between 6 and 21 years of age. So long as the 
present diversity as to age in the enumeration prevails, it is difficult to arrive at con- 
clusions entirely satisfactory as to the relative effectiveness of the Stategchool sys- 
tems. In the inquiries sent out by this Office it is sought to ascertain the approximate 
number of persons between 6 and 16 years of age included in the school censuses. Only 
5 States and 1 Territory are able to respond to this inquiry, but in 4 other States the 
census of the school age corresponds very nearly to the enumeration desired. It is be- 
lieved that school officers throughout the country recognize the desirability of a cen- 
sus that shall be uniform with respect to the ages included, but they have not at com- 
mand the means of obtaining such a census. 
Duration of school term.—Two States only and 4 Territories do not report the aver- 
age duration of schools. The term shows decrease below that reported in 1881 in 
the following: Alabama, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mis- 
sissippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Utah Territory. 
The length of the term varies greatly, ranging from 199 days in Maryland to 62} 
days in North Carolina. The differences in this respect are more clearly seen by a 
comparison of the different geographical sections. The term is more than 5 months 
in three of the six New England States, in five of the six Middle Atlantic States, in 
three of the nine Northern Central States, in one of the two Pacific Slope States, and 
in the District of Columbia and Idaho Territory; and itis above 3 months in all the 
States of the sections named. On the other hand, the school term is less than 3 months 
in all the South Atlantic States, in two of the four Gulf States, in one of the six South- 
ern Central States, and does not equal 4 months in any State of the two last named 
sections. These differences deserve the serious attention of those who can affect leg- 
islation in respect either to the duration of the school term or the funds necessary for 
the maintenance of the schools for the time allowed, since it cannot be doubted that 
the differences in the opportunities for early instruction indicated in the varying 
as i 
1 For all the States, enrolment is reported by the local school officials. Enrolment for the Territories 
is obtained from the returns for 1881-'82 and in two instances from the Census of 1880. 
2Delaware, Michigan, and Missouri did not report average daily attendance. For Michigan and Mis- 
souri the census figures were used. Average daily attendance for seven Territories was taken from 
Teports of territorial superintendents and for three others from the Census of 1880. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
XXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
duration of the school period will ultimately be the cause of great diversity in the 
average intelligence, enterprise, and worthy ambition of the citizens. It is true that 
those who have meagre school opportunities may make greater progress than those 
to whom every provision is freely extended, but examples of this kind seldom occur 
outside of communities so filled with intelligence and enthusiasm that the most ob- 
scure individuals cannot escape the inspiring influence. 
Number and salaries of teachers.— The number of teachers reported is, for the States, 
290,028; for 9 Territories, 3,266; total, 293,294, being an increase of 4,135 over the 
number reported in 1881. The sex of teachers is not reported from Georgia, Maine, 
Mississippi, and Idaho Territory ; so far as the figures are given, the number of male 
teachers is 106,676, and of female teachers, 166,705. Both numbers show increase over 
the same for 1881, but the proportion of female teachers is greater than at the last 
report. Even in the frontier States, the proportion of women engaged in teaching is 
rapidly increasing. 
There is an upward movement in teachers’ salaries, 18 States showing increase in 
the average salaries for both sexes; 4, viz, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
and South Carolina, increase in salaries for men, but not for women; and West Vir- 
ginia, increase in salaries for women only. Salaries have also increased in Utahsince 
the last report received, namely 1878. 
Finances.— Several of the States include balances from the last school year in the 
statement of annual income. Where this occurs, attention has been called to the fact 
in the summary, and an examination of Table I of the appendix will show in most in- 
stances the amount so included. 
As the figures stand, the summary for 1882 shows an income of $94,327,188 and an 
expenditure of $91,158,039, against $88,142,088 income for 1881 and $85,111,442 ex- 
penditure for the same year. 
Five States and 1 Territory for 1882, against 7 States and 2 Territories for 1881, 
fail in making report of the value of school property. The total for 1882 for the 
country is $216,562,197, against $186,143,452, the difference between the figures being 
$30,418,745, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Idaho, non-reporting States and Terri- 
tory for 1881, would make up for 1882 $24,993,235 of this excess. Making allowance for 
this sum, there is reported a net increase of $5,425,510 in the value of school property 
in the country. 
Inthe permanent State school funds there is also areported increase of over $5,000,000, 
Many of the States show very fair increase in their permanent funds, but $3,500,000 
of the amount of increase is made up in Kansas, where the State superintendent re- 
ports $13,500,000 as the estimated amount of the fund when all shall be available, 
against $10,000,000, his estimate for 1881. 
A table of the per capita expenditure for the year, based on school population, en- 
rolment, &c., has been made up, as in previous years. For 1882 as for 1881, estimates 
have been made in this Office, where it was practicable, for the non-reporting States. 
As the table stands, Massachusetts among the States heads the list and Alabama is 
at the foot, i. e., Massachusetts spends annually for each child of legal school age 
over fifteen times as much as Alabama. 
The sources of the public school funds can be ascertained by reference a the ab- 
stracts of the several State reports and to Table 1 of the appendix. From the latter 
it will be seen that local taxes are the main support of the public schools in a majority 
of the States, a condition that seems essential to a progressive, efficient system of free 
schools. The figures show increase in the amount realized from local taxes, as com- 
pared with 1881, in Connecticut, Georgia, Iinois, lowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
The favorable view of the public schools of our country presented in, the statistics 
is confirmed by the verbal statements of superintendents and other officials and accords 
with the impression I have received from personal observation in various parts of the 
country.
-P-A-G-E-27
SCHOOL SUPERVISION. XXVIII 
Progress is not limited to the increase of scholars, teachers, funds, &c., but appears 
in the organization of the school systems, in the greater efficiency of the work carried 
on in the schools, and, what is still more important, in a deeper and more intelligent 
interest on the part of the people. Everywhere there is evidence of a clearer under- 
standing of the purposes of the schools, of their relation to our civil rights and liberties, 
and a readier disposition to adopt measures for their support and improvement. 
Work of superintendents.— The superintendents are a body of earnest and determined 
men, having a clear understanding of the wants of the schools and of the temper of 
the public whose good will and codperation they must secure. Upon superintendents 
devolves almost entirely the labor of stimulating, watching, and directing legislation 
in school matters, interpreting the school laws, and keeping teachers and parents 
advised as to their requirements. To these officers more than to any other agency 
must be attributed the two most promising general movements now going on with a 
view to the greater efficiency of the schools, namely, the increase of local taxation in 
the Southern States and the effort to abolish small, independent, irresponsible dis- 
tricts in the older Northern States. 
Hon. H. Clay Armstrong, State superintendent, Alabama, calls attention to the 
fact that in 20 counties of the State the public fund was supplemented by patrons to 
the amount of $66,990, and in 46 other counties by an amount equal, prpbably, to 
$175,000. He appeals to the general assembly to increase the annual appropriation 
to $230,000, and recommends a special school tax for the purchase of sites, building, 
and pay of teachers, not to exceed 4 mills on the dollar. Hon. D. H. Pope, State 
superintendent, Arkansas, reports the opposition to the school tax as declining in his 
State and that in the towns the public funds have been largely increased by volun- 
tary subscriptions. Private subscriptions to the school fund are not officially reported 
from other States, but they have occurred to some extent; meanwhile he advocates 
of the school tax meet with more and more favor. 
Hon. J. W. Dickinson, secretary of the Massachusetts board of education, has had 
the satisfaction of seeing his efforts to overcome the district system crowned with 
success. The law abolishing the district system and making the township the unit 
for the control of educational affairs went into effect January 1, 1883. Other super- 
intendents are indefatigable in their efforts to bring about a like result. While noth- 
ing new on this point is elicited in the report of the year, there is an important accu- 
mulation of evidence. Hon, N. A. Luce, State superintendent, Maine, says that 
there are 36 towns in the State so cut up that they average less than 20 scholars to 
each district and 79 towns containing 693 districts so small that in summer terms the 
average attendance upon each school is less than 10 scholars. Hon, J. W. Patterson, 
State superintendent, New Hampshire, reports for the year ending June, 1883, 786 
schools averaging 12 scholars or less and 313 schools averaging 6 scholars or less. 
Hon. C, D. Hine, secretary of the Connecticut board of education, reports for the year 
ending August 31, 1883, the number of districts in which the average attendance was 
between 8 and 18, 548; number in which it was less than 8, 165; number in which it 
was 5 or less, 94. Hon. M. A. Newell, secretary of the Maryland board of education, 
instances one county containing 21 schools, the average attendance for each being 
between 1 and 8 scholars. 
Hon. G. 8. W. Crawford, State superintendent, Tennessee, observes, in this con- 
nection : 
The school fund should be distributed in such a way as to secure to every child in 
a given district the same number of school days as is enjoyed by the children living 
in the other districts of the same county. By the present system great injustice is 
done. Two school districts in the same county lying side by side are taxed exactly 
alike; but in one district there are twice as many children as in the other, and the 
one with the greater number has twice as many school days as the other. 
County supervision.—Intimately connected with the abolition of small districts is the 
establishment of county supervision or supervision of groups of towns uniting vol- 
untarily in legal organizations for this purpose. In some of the States the county
-P-A-G-E-28
XXVIIL_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
svhools are virtually without supervision, while in a number of States in which 
county superintendents are employed the remuneration is so small that it is impos- 
sible to secure the entire service of competent men. 
Efficient éounty superintendence or its equivalent offers the readiest solution of the 
most perplexing problems relating to the rural schools. The scope of its action and 
the need for its service are thus summed up by Hon. R. D. Shannon, State saperin- 
tendent, Missouri, whose views are confirmed by the statements of many other super- 
intendents who have conferred with me upon the subject. 
Mr. Shannon says: 
‘The greatest of all needs is an efficient, responsible, paid county superintendency. 
Our system will never be successful without it. 
* * * * * * * 
We say that no public moneys shall be distributed to a district that has failed to 
maintain a public free school, and yet we have provided no means by which the fact 
shall be ascertained by the officer who makes the distribution. 
We say that the net proceeds of all fines, forfeitures, &c., shall be placed in the 
public school funds of the several counties, and yet the evidence is conclusive that 
immense sums which should be placed thus annually are not reported. In my re- 
ports I have frequently estimated the annual Joss from this source as not less than 
$50,000. In the confirmation of the correctness of this estimate I invite attention to 
two facts shown in this report: First, although the year for which the report is made 
was not characterized by unusual disorder or criminal proceedings in courts —it was 
a notably quiet and peaceful year — the amount of fines realized and placed in the 
county funds, as heretofore stated, exceeded the annual average over $40,000. Second, 
the great city of St. Louis reports collections in round numbers of $2,000, while 
Bates County reports $6,000. No one will believe that any such disproportion existed 
between the fines imposed in the two localities. 
If I should say that we lose $100,000 a year from this source for the lack of super- 
vision, the statement would not only express a well founded belief but would accord 
with the settled conviction of every citizen who is at all familiar with public 
affairs, 
How is it possible for any system to succeed without executive agency or supervi- 
sion? We deem it necessary to have our schools in cities or towns under supervision, 
but the schools of our counties are left without control or superintendency. Success, 
under such circumstances, the prevention of loss, both in time and money, and of ex- 
travagance, is impossible. Never did such an anomalous state of facts exist in any 
other department of the State government. , 
No State in the Union ever expressed more liberal and enlightened sentiments and 
purposes toward public education than are found in the constitution and statutes of 
Missouri, and no State ever so signally failed to provide efiective means for execut- 
ing its will. There is only one possible solution of the problem, and that is rational, 
easy, andeconomical. A failure to solveit—a failure to apply the remedy for the many 
admitted and glaring evils arising from our loose methods under the law —is waste- 
ful, extravagant, and expensive. The solution is the establishment of ‘executive 
agency, or direction, in each county. No business under government or in social or 
private life was ever successfully conducted without a manager or superintendent; 
it could not possibly, in the very nature of the case, fully succeed. Yet our school 
system is absolutely without any superintending control or management. It rests 
alone with the legislature to say how long this state of affairs shall continue. 
Improvement of the teaching force.— The means of improving the teaching force of the 
rural schools engages the serious attention of all who are interested in the education 
of our children. Efforts are being made in a number of States to raise the standard of 
teachers’ examinations, and in several States it is proposed to do away with the third- 
grade certificate, for which the requirements are very low. Unfortunately the ex- 
amining bodies have little voice in appointing teachers, so that the qualifications of 
teachers are after all determined by local influences. Often every other considera- 
tion is sacrificed to the desire for cheapness ; again, kinship or political relations de- 
cide the choice of ateacher. So long as this loose system of appointment is tolerated 
it will be difficult to maintain high standards for the service. 
The increase of salaries previously noted is a favorable circumstance; not only are 
better teachers thereby attracted to the schools, but the interest of the districts in 
securing good teachers is proportionately increased.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. XXIX 
6 
The effect of the revised school law of Michigan, which, as noted in my last report, 
became operative July 1, 1881, has been followed with much interest. The law pro- 
vides for the examination of teachers by county boards under regulations calculated 
to raise the standard of qualification and make it more nearly uniform throughout 
the State. The law has naturally had the effect of diminishing the number of ignorant, 
untrained applicants for positions and attracting an opposite class, with the inevitabie 
result of increasing wages. The State superintendent, Hon. Varnum B. Cochran, says 
in this connection: ‘‘ The wages of men have risen during the year an average of $4.61 
per month and of women $4.83 per month in the rural districts, where, of course, the 
effects of the law are soonest and chiefly felt.” 
The decline of salaries in Michigan for the past few years has been the occasion of 
regret, as the established reputation of the school system of that State gives peculiar 
weight to its example. It is to be hoped that the advance here noted will be perma- 
nent. 
The suggestion of a minimum salary fixed by State law meets with approval in 
many States. Hon. C. W. von Coelln, State superintendent, Iowa, calls attention to 
the fact that the salaries of teachers of ungraded schools in his State do not average 
above $150 per annum, whereas a common laborer receives $200 with board and is not 
expected to dress well and has no examination or institute fees. Mr. von Coelln adds 
significantly, ‘the salaries of teachers are the only salaries of publicemployés” wholly 
within the control of the people. 
Inquiries instituted in several States during the years 1882 and 1883 have elicited 
important information with reference to the increasing number of trained teachers 
employed in the schools and their increasing tenure of office: 
In California 584 districts were reported as employing the same teacher more than 
one year and 568 teachers were graduates of normal schools. 
In Connecticut, of 3,120 teachers employed, 470 were beginners. 
In New York, of 31,233 teachers employed in 1882, there were 1,183 graduates of nor- 
mal schools. 
In West Virginia, ont of 3,045 teachers employed, 1,115 had taught the same school 
two or more terms previously ; 640 reported the present year their first in the work; 
711 reported having attended one of the State normal schools. 
In Illinois 1,465 teachers were reported as having been trained in the normal 
university, of whom 151 were graduates. 
In Kansas, out of 8,150 teachers, 214 were normal graduates, 79 held State certifi- 
cates, and 3,953 had attended normal institutes. ° 
In ‘Maine, out of 7,599 teachers, 6,402 had had previous experience ; 601 were grad- 
uates from normal schools. 
In Massachusetts 30 per cent. of the teachers have received professional training 
in normal schools. 
In New Jersey the following was reported for the year ending August 31, 1882: 
Number of teachers who have been in the same school 1 year or less, 1,063; 1-5 
years, 1,302; 5-10 years, 635; 10-15 years, 253; 15-20 years, 96; 20-25 years, 35; over 
25 years, 22. Average time for teachers throughout the State, 3 years and 9 months; 
average time for teachers in cities, 6 years and 6 months. 
In New Hampshire for the year ending June, 1883, the number of teachers reported 
as having no previous experience was 569; number reported as teaching in the same 
school two successive terms, 1,421; number who had been trained in normal schools, 
318. 
Courses of study for rural schools.— The excellent effects of graded courses of study 
in the rural schools are admitted wherever they have been introduced, but there is 
an unaccountable indifference to the subject in many localities. 
Without this important aid it seems impossible to maintain systematic progress in 
the schools and equally impossible toform any clear idea of the attainments made by 
the scholars. With such courses universally employed, it would be comparatively 
easy to find out the number of scholars pursuing the obligatory branches and the 
number in higher and optional branches. This analysis would be of material help in 
the endeavor to form union or graded county schools and in deciding upon the means 
of bringing the common free schools into line with higher institutions, especially with

the public high schools, schools endowed with the land grant of 1862, and State 
universities. 
Building and apparatus.— The improvement of school-houses is noticeable through- 
out the country, provision being made in anumber of States for the periodical inspec- 
tion of the buildings. 
The last thirty years have somewhat extended our knowledge about the require- 
ments for school buildings of different kinds. This knowledge is ofwo kinds, of which 
one, as to the best methodof construction under prescribed conditions of site, size, and 
material, should be possessed by the architect. employed ; the other, as. to the best 
form and aspect of school rooms, the best modes of heating, lighting, and ventilat- 
ing, &c., should be studied and known by the school authorities, as well as by the 
architect; in this way the public may have some hope of obtaining for its money ed- 
ifices that express, by the.most direct and logical style of structure known to the 
building art, the results of the widest knowledge attainable as to the requirements 
for teaching, for hygiene, for safety against accidents, &c. Asscience andexperiment 
have been accumulating both kinds of knowledge, both should be used and manifested 
in public school architecture. It is a vain waste of money at this day to turn out 
merely a Gothic or a Greek building from the architect’s studio, for we are neither 
Goths nor Greeks ; it is equally wasteful to plan good school rooms and class rooms, 
easy stairways, and theoretically perfect heat flues and air ducts, if we ruin them by 
bad construction or the use of bad material. The literature of building abounds 
in many excellent books; so many, indeed, that to merely name the best would fill 
pages of this report. Yet I must find space to mention two: the article published by 
the New Hampshire State board of health on ‘‘ Suburban school-houses,” written by 
Mr. W. R. Briggs, of Bridgeport, Conn., republished as a separate pamphlet, and the 
excellent Handbuch der Schulhygiene of Dr. Adolf Baginsky, of which a second 
edition is just announced by a Stuttgart publisher. 
In order that certain questions connected with the ventilation and air supply of 
school buildings might be definitively settled for the whole country, I have requested 
R. L. Packard, esq., translator of this Office, who is an excellent practical chemist, to 
institute the necessary investigations and experiments,.so arranging them as to se- 
cure the codperation of school authorities and experts throughout the country. His 
results and conclusions will be published as soon as they can be properly completed. 
Among other matters, I may mention that Mr. Packard is experimenting on the best 
and simplest form of a durable instrument by which teachers can speedily ascertain 
the quantity of carbonic acid gas in the air of their school rooms, this gas serving 
approximately as an indication of the quantity of other dissolved impurities. 
Circular of Information No. 4, 1880, republished by this Office more than once to 
supply the great demand for it, has spread Mr. T. M. Clark’s wise suggestions respect- 
ing right methods of placing, arranging, constructing, lighting, and heating school 
buildings over every part of the country; this pamphlet does not give rigid plans for 
buildings, from which deviation becomes difficult, but discusses the difficulties and 
necessities of common school]-house construction in a perfectly clear, systematic way, 
illustrating the points to be emphasized by drawings and illustrations. It forms the 
first part of a plan long since matured by this Office for the information of the educa- 
tional public respecting the general subject of school architecture. 
The rural schools generally are not well supplied with apparatus, reference books, 
and illustrative material. Improvement in this respect is greatly needed. 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL LAWS. 
The following compilation shows the status of each State. and Territory with ref 
erence to compulsion : 
STATES., 
California, March 28, 1874, enacted that every parent, guardian, or other person 
having control or charge of any child or children 8 to 14 years of age must send such
-P-A-G-E-31
  COMPULSORY SCHOOL LAWS. XXXI 
to a publie school for at least two-thirds of the time during which, a public school 
should be taught in the city, county, or school district of such child’s residence, unless 
the child or children should be shown to be physically or mentally disabled, taught 
otherwise the common school primary branches of study, or out of reach of school ; 
penalty, not to exceed $20 for a first proven offence, or $20 to $50 for subsequent ones, 
with costs of suit. 
Connecticut, in 1982, passed a kindred law, requiring that, except in cases where the 
physical or mental condition of a child made attendance at school inexpedient or im- 
practicable, parents or other persons having control of any child 8 to 14 years of age 
should cause such child to attend a public day school or to receive elsewhere regu- 
Jar and thorough instruction in reading, writing, English grammar, geography, and 
arithmetic during at least 12 weeks, or 60 full school days, in any consecutive 12 
months, 6 weeks at least of which attendance or instruction must be consecutive. 
Each week of failure to comply with this requirement 1s made a distinct offence, pun- 
ishable with a fine not to exceed $5. No child under 14 years of age that has resided 
in the United States 9 months may be employed to labor, unless such child can be 
shown by official evidence to have complied with the above requirements, and any 
person that employs a child contrary to these provisions is to be fined not more than 
$60. 
Iilinois, in 1883, required that every person having the control and charge of any 
child or children 8 to 14 years of age should send such child or children to a public 
or private day school for a period of not less than 12 weeks in each school year, unless 
such child or children be excused by the school officers of the city, town, or school 
district in which the child or children reside. Such excuse may be given by said 
officers for any good cause shown, namely, a mental or bodily condition that would 
prevent attendance at school or application to study for the time required by this 
act, a proven acquaintance with the ordinary branches of learning usually taught 
in public schools, or a distance of 2 miles from the public school which the child or 
children would have to attend under the provisions of the act; penalty for the vio- 
lation of this statute, $5 to $20. 
Kansas, since 1874, has had essentially the same provisions on this subject as Illi- 
nois enacted in 1883, except (1) that the attendance required of 12 weeks in each 
year must include 6 weeks of consecutive attendance and (2) that the penalty for 
violation of the law is made progressive, being not less than $5 nor more than $10 
for a first offence and not less than $10 nor more than $20 for a second or any subse- 
quent offence. 
Maine, in 1875, enacted that every parent, guardian, or other person in the State, 
having control of a child or children 9 to 15 years of age, should be required to send 
such child or children to a public school at least 12 weeks in each year, unless 
such child or children be excused by the school officers of the town for the reasons 
recited in the preceding laws of California and Illinois, except in cases where a pub- 
lic school is not taught for 3 months in the year within a mile and a half, by the 
shortest travelled road, of the residence of a delinquent or is not taught within the 
school district in which the child resides; penalty for a parent, guardian, or other 
person in control failing to send a child or children to school according to this law, 
a fine of not more than $5 and costs of prosecution; penalty for a child neglecting 
or refusing to attend school as required, unless excused by the proper school officers, 
not to exceed $5 for each offence. 
Massachusetts, since 1873, has required every person having control of a child 8 to 
14 years of age to cause such child to attend, at least 20 weeks each year, some 
public day school in the city or town in which he resides, which.time is to be, 
divided, as far as the arrangements of school terms will allow, into 2 terms, each of 
10 consecutive weeks, unless excused by the school committee because of poverty, bad 
physical or mental condition of the child, or instruction elsewhere or previously for

  XXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
alike period in approved schools ; penalty for violation of the rule, a fine not to ex- 
ceed $20 in each case of neglect. 
To secure still further for all children in the State some fair amount of education, 
the laws of Massachusetts, since 1876, have forbidden the employment of children 
under 10 years of age in any manufacturing, mechanical, or mercantile establish- 
ment; and also the employment, except during the vacations of the public schools, 
of any child under 14 years of age, unless he has, for at least 20 weeks in the year 
preceding such employment, attended some public or private day school under teachers 
approved by the school committee of the place where such school is kept, which time 
may be divided, as before noted, into 2 terms of 10 consecutive weeks each. Since 
1878 no child under 14 who cannot read or write may be employed. as above during 
the sessions of the public schools, even if he has attended school the year before ; 
penalty for violation of either of these statutes, $20 to $50, to go to the use of the 
public schools, 
Michigan enacted in 1871, repealed in 1481, and reénacted in 1883 a law that every 
parent, guardian, or other person in the State having control and charge of any child 
or children between the ages of 8 and 14 should be required to send such child or 
children to a public school for a period of at least 4 months in each school year, at 
least 6 weeks of which sending must be consecutive, unless such child or children 
should be excused, for the reasons given in several preceding cases, by the board of 
the school district in which the parents or guardians reside. 
Still further to secure the education of all children as far as may be possible, there 
are appended to this reénacted law the following requirements: (1) That no child 
under the age of 14 years shall be employed by any person, company, or corporation 
to labor in any business, unless such child shall have attended some public or pri- 
vate day school, where instruction was given by a teacher qualified to instruct in 
such branches as are usually taught in primary schools, at least 4 months of the 12 
months preceding the time in which such child shall be employed; (2) that every par- 
ent, guardian, or other person having charge or control of any child 8 to 14 years 
of age that has been temporarily discharged from any business or employment 
shall send such child to some public or private day school for the period for which 
the child shall have been discharged, unless the child be excused from such attend- 
ance for the reasons referred to in section first; penalty for violation of either of 
these provisiouis, $5 to $10 fine for a first offence and not less than $10 for each subse- 
quent one. 
Nevada, in 1873, passed a law with essentially the same requirements as the preced- 
ing as to the age of children to be sent to school (8 to 14) and as to the reasons for 
excuse in special cases by the district schvol board; but the time for attendance at 
school was made ‘at least 16 weeks in each school year, at least 8 weeks of which 
shall be consecutive.” Special provision was also made for informing the school 
board of each district, through the principal of each school, as to absentees from 
school, that they might, in cases of failure to comply with the provisions of the first 
section of the law, either obtain from the parents or guardians of non-attending 
children the fine of $50 to $100 imposed for a first offence, with $100 to $200 for each 
subsequent offence, or, failing to obtain it, institute proceedings to secure it. 
« New Hampshire, July 14, 1871, enacted a compulsory statute requiring ‘every 
parent, guardian, master, or other person having the custody, control, or charge of 
any child between the ages of 8 and 14 years, residing in any school district in which 
a public school is annually taught for the period of 12 weeks or more, within 2 miles 
by the nearest travelled road from his residence,” to “cause such child to attend such 
public school for 12 weeks in every year,” * * * 6 weeks at least of this attendance 
to be consecutive, unless such child should be excused from such attendance by the 
proper school authorities for such reasons as have been indicated in preceding cases. 
Notice of this requirement was directed to be given annually by the school officers 
by posting it in three of the most public places in each school district or by publish-

ing it for at least three weeks successively in some newspaper printed in their town 
in the month of August; penalty for violation of the act by parents, guardians, &c., 
$10 for a first offence, $20 for every subsequent offence. 
Under amendments of 1881, in sections 11 and 12 of chapter 91 in general laws of 
1878, no child under 16 years of age may be employed in any manufacturing estab- 
lishment, unless he has attended school at least 12 weeks in the year preceding, and 
none under said age may be so employed (except in vacations of the school in the dis- 
trict in which he resides), unless he can write legibly and read fluently in readers of 
the grade usually classed as third readers. Nor may any child under 14 be so em- 
ployed unless he has attended school in the district in which he dwelt at least 6 
months in the preceding school year, or during the whole time school was kept in that 
year; penalty for employment except under the conditions prescribed, $20 for each 
offence. 
New Jersey passed, March 27, 1874, and amended, April 9, 1875, a law requiring 
parents and guardians having charge of children 8 to 14 years of age to cause them to 
attend some school at least 12 weeks in each year, 6 of these weeks to be consecutive, 
or to be instructed at home at least 12 weeks each year in the branches of education 
commonly taught in the public schools, unless the physical or mental condition of 
such children renders such attendance (or instruction) inexpedient or impracticable ; 
penalty for failure to comply with the provisions of this act, $2 for a first offence; 
afterwards, $3 a week for not more than 12 weeks in any year during which, after 
written notice, there has been failure to comply with the provisions of the act. The 
district clerk of each school district and some person in each city selected by the city 
board of education are to report to the collector of the township or the treasurer of 
the city where the offence has occurred the names of all persons that fail to com- 
ply with the law, and the officer to whom such report is made is to proceed to collect, 
the penalties in any court of competent jurisdiction, such penalties to be added to 
the public school money of the school district in which the offence occurred ; provided 
that this law shall not be operative in school districts in which there are not sufficient 
accommodations to seat the children compelled to attend school under the provisions 
of the act. 
New York passed in May, 1874, and amended in 1876 “An act to secure to children 
the benefits of elementary education,” which requires all parents and those that have 
the care of children to instruct them or cause them to be instructed in spelling, 
reading, writing, English grammar, geography, and arithmetic. Every parent, guar- 
dian, or other person having the control or charge of any child 8 to 14 years of age 
has to cause such child to attend some public or private day school at least 14 weeks 
each year, or to be instructed regularly at home for the same period’ in the above 
named branches, unless the physical or mental condition of the child should be such 
as to make this attendance or instruction inexpedient or impracticable. 
Amendments in chapter 372 of laws of 1876 put restrictions on the employment of 
children under the age of 14 not instructed as aforesaid, made it the duty of the regu- 
lar school trustees or of officers employed for the purpose to examine all manufact- 
uring establishments within their jurisdiction, to see whether these restrictions were 
complied with; and if they should find them violated they were to report the viola- 
tions to the chief fiscal officer of the city or supervisor of the town where the violator 
lived, with a view to the collection of the proper penalty, which was made $1 for # 
first offence and $5 for every week, not to exceed 13, in any year during which, after 
written notice from the proper officer, there should be a continued violation of the 
law. If poverty should prevent the purchase by any parent or guardian of the neces- 
sary text books for a child whom he was willing to send to school as required, the 
school officers were to provide the text books, to be paid for by the treasurer of their © 
city or supervisor of the town. If a child whose parent or guardian is willing to send 
him to school cannot be induced to attend for the 14 weeks required, the school trustee 
or other officer appointed for these cases may, on the written statement of parent or

guardian to that effect, deal with such child as a habitual truant and relieve the 
parent of the penalty incurred, 
Ohio, in 1877, established a kindred compulsory requirement as to sending to 
school children 8 to 14 years of age, making the time for such sending 12 weeks in 
each school year, 6 of which should be consecutive, unless the school officers of the 
district or subdistrict in which the parent or guardian resides should excuse such 
child from attendance for the reasons indicated in the laws of several preceding States 
or because the time and labor of the child are essentially necessary for the support 
of an indigent parent, brother, or sister. 
Provision is also made against the employment of children under 14 years of age 
during the school hours of their place of residence, unless such children shall have 
had at least the 12 weeks’ schooling above required and haye delivered to their em- 
ployers a certificate to that effect from the school officers of their place of residence 
or from the teacher of a school they have attended. Boards of education are required 
to look after this matter of employment of untaught children each February and 
September. Where poverty of parent or guardian prevents the purchase of neces- 
sary text books for the school study required, the proper school officers are author- 
ized to furnish these. Penalty for parent, guardian, or other person failing to com- 
ply with the provisions of this chapter, not less than $2 nor more than $5 for a first 
offence, nor less than $5 nor more than $10 for each subsequent offence. And if the 
clerk of a board of education fails to prosecute every offence required to be thus pun- 
ished he is made liable to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $20 for each case 
of such neglect. Two weeks’ attendance at a half time or night school is made, by 
the same statute, equivalent to an attendance of one week at a full day school. 
Pennsylvania, to secure some instruction for its children, has since 1849 forbidden 
that any children from 13 to 16 years of age be employed in or about any factories, 
unless such children haye attended school at least 3 consecutive months within 
the year of such employment; penalty for owners of factories and employers of chil- 
dren ‘Violating the provisions of this statute, as well as for parents consenting to or 
conniving at such violation, $50 for every offence, 
Rhode Island, in 1854, passed a law to forbid the employment in factories of any 
minor under 15 years of age, unless such minor shall have attended school for a term 
of at least 3 months in the year next preceding such employment; nor was any 
such minor to be employed more than 9 months in any calendar year— evidently 
to afford an opportunity for 3 months’ schooling; penalty for owner, employer, or © 
agent of such factories employing children contrary to the statute or for parents or 
guardians permitting or consenting to such employment, $20 for each offence. 
Vermont passed, November 21, 1867, and amended, November 23, 1870, a compulsory 
school law requiring every. child of good health and sound mind to attend school 
under the public school system at least 3 months each year, ‘‘unless such child 
has been otherwise furnished with the means of education for a like period or has 
already acquired the branches of study taught in the public schools.” A child neg- 
lecting to comply with this requirement is made liable to arrest and delivery to the 
school teacher of his district, notice of which is to be given in writing to the parent, 
guardian, or master of the child, who is to be required in said notice to send the 
child to school regularly. If such parent, guardian, or master does not, for 6 days 
fter receiving such notice, cause the child to attend school regularly, having no 
good reason therefor, he is made liable to a fine of $10 to $20, said fine to go for the 
benefit of schools in the town. 
It is also forbidden that a child 10 to 14 years of age who has resided in the State 
ayear shall be employed in a mill or factory, unless such child has attended a public 
school 3 months during the preceding year; penalty for employment, without evi- 
dence of such attendance, $10 to $20, to go one-half to the complainant and one;half 
to the town. 
Wisconsin, March 19, 1873, passed an act for placing in truant schools for 2 years
-P-A-G-E-35
  COMPULSORY SCHOOL LAWS. XXXV 
children 8 to 17 years of age that were habitually truant, and for enforcing daily at- 
tendance on such schools. 
In 1879 a further law was passed, to take effect September 1 of that year, ‘‘to secure 
to children the benefit of an elementary education.” This required parents and others 
having charge or control of any child or children 7 to 15 years of age to send such 
child or children to a public or private school for at least 12 weeks in each school year, 
unless excused by the school authorities of the school district, village, or city in which 
the parent or guardian should reside for such reasons as have been recited in the case 
of other States. The school district board or board of education, as the case might be, 
was required to look after such children 7 to 15 years of age in September and February 
of each year, and where any of that age were found not to be in attendance on any 
school a record of each cage was to be filed with the clerk of the board, this record to 
be open for inspection to any elector or taxpayer of the district. To take away from 
neglectful parents all excuse for not sending children to school the school officers were 
authorized to furnish free text books, as in New York and Ohio, to parents not able to 
procure such otherwise. If, in view of these provisions, parents or guardians should 
still fail to comply with the provisions of the act, they were to be fined from $5 to $10 
for the first offence and from $10 to $20 for each subsequent offence. 
TERRITORIES. 
Arizona, which in 1875 (February 9) passed a compulsory law requiring children 8 
to 14 to be sent to school for 16 weeks of each school year, 8 of the 16 to be consecu- 
tive, and which imposed a fine of $50 to $100 for a first violation of the law, with $100 
to $200 for subsequent violations, has dropped this act from its amended school laws 
of 1883. 
. Dakota, in its latest school law, of March 8, 1883, requires parents, guardians, or 
others having charge of a child or children 10 to 14-years of age to send such to a 
public school at least 12 weeks in each school year, at least 6 of these weeks to be con- 
secutive, unless excused by the school board for the reasons given in preceding laws. 
School officers are directed to ascertain whether any children are deprived of school 
privileges while an accessible school is taught, and are to notify parents, guardians, 
&e., and direct that such children be sent to school. If, after such notice, there is 
failure or neglect to send, complaint is to be made before a justice and the offender 
to be fined $3 to $10. If school officers fail to make complaint in such cases, other 
persons may do so. 
For the District of Columbia it was ordered in 1864, June 23, that every person in 
the District having under control any child between the ages of 8 and 14 years should 
send annually, during the continuance of such control, such child to some public 
school in that part of the District in which he should at that time reside. Such send- 
ing to school was to continue at least 12 weeks, 6 of them consecutive. For every 
neglect of such duty the party offending was to forfeit, for school use in that part of 
the District, not to exceed $20, unless it should be made to appear to the justice that 
the party so offending either could not send the child to school, had been sending it 
to some other than a publfe school, or showed such physical or mental inferiority in 
the child as made school attendance inexpedient, 
Governor Sheldon, of New Mevico, in his report to the Secretary of the Interior for 
1881, says: ‘‘Education is compulsory for 5 months of the year.” e 
Washington Territory requires in its school law of 1877 that in any city, town, or 
. Village containing more than 400 inhabitants every parent, guardian, or other per- 
son residing therein, having control of any child or children between the ages of 6 
and 16, shall send such child or children to public school for at least 6 months in each 
school year, at least 6 weeks of which shall be consecutive, unless the mental or 
bodily condition of the child or children prevent this, or unless they are engaged in 
Jabor neceysary for their own support or that of others dependent on them, or are 
take the ordinary school branches in a private school, or have already acquired 
thesd; no penalty.
-P-A-G-E-36
  XXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Wyoming, in 1873, made it the duty of parents, guardians, or other persons having 
control of children 6 to 21 years of age to send such children to some school at least 
3 months in each year, unless excused on a physician’s certificate of sickness or by 
the district board because attendance would work great hardship; penalty for dis- 
obedience, not to exceed $25 for each offence. 
COMPULSORY INSTRUCTION ABROAD. 
Germany:— Compulsory elementary instruction is universal in Germany, in some 
parts of which laws on the subject were passed as long ago as the seventeenth century. 
In other European countries, the idea of obligatory instruction was rfot expressed 
in the form of laws until the present century and in some of them such laws are still 
wanting. ® 
Denmark passed a law making elementary instruction obligatory in 1739, which 
proved inadequate in certain respects, and a new law was enacted in 1814, 
Switzerland made primary instruction obligatory in 1832 and 1833. 
A law to the same effect was passed in Greece in 1834, 
Sweden.— The Swedish law dates from 1842, and Norway followed in 1869. 
Austria-~-Hungary.— The first obligatory law was also passed in the year 1869 in Aus: 
tria~-Hungary, making instruction compulsory for children between 6 and 12 years of 
age. The time was extended 2 years by the law of 1882. 
In England, acts of Parliament in 1870, 1876, and 1880 authorized the local school 
boards to compel parents to send their Giang of school age (6 to 13 years) to school. 
Scotland followed with a law to the same effect in 1872, 
In Italy, where education has received especial attention in recent years, the com- 
pulsory law was enacted in 1877. 
In Japan education was made obligatory by the law of 1879 and 1880, 
France.— Ox June 16,1881, the French Assembly passed a law making primary in- 
struction absolutely free throughout the Republic, and this was followed by the law 
of March 28, 1882, making it obligatory. 
Roumelia.— Primary instruction is also compulsory in Roumelia and in the United 
States of Colombia. 
Belgium.—A bill is to be introdueed into the Belgian legislaturein 1883 making ele- 
wentary instruction obligatory throughout the kingdom. 
BRIEF SUMMARY OF TILE EDUCATIONAL CONDITION OF THE UNION. 
NEW ENGLAND STATES— MAINE. 
Although there was again a decline in the number of youth of school age and also a 
considerable diminution in the enrolment in public schools, there was, if the figures 
given are correct, an increase of 11,688 in average daily attendance, while the aggre- 
gate daily attendance advanced so much as to encourage the State superintendent to 
believe that on the whole there was a healthier condition of school affairs. Of tho 
teachers employed, a much larger proportion had had some previous experience. 
Through shortening the sessions of teachers’ institutes a great increase of attendance 
on them was secured, resulting in better school work. The chief hinderance to prog- 
ess, the old district system, still held its ground however, only two towns having 
abandoned it in 1882 for the town system. While it continues, thoroughly good 
schools outside of cities seem impossible. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE, 
An improvement over the previous year is noted in 1882. There were 1,114 more 
pupils enrolled, 53 more in average daily attendance, and 713 more in private schools. 
Five more school-houses are reported and 7 more were built than in the previous yoar, 
while those unfit for the purpose for which they were used decreased by 32. There

were 21 more fitted out with maps and globes, and the estimated value of school prop- 
erty was $227,828 greater than in 188081. An increase in teachers of 9, with 33 more 
who were graduates from normal schools, is a favorable sign. The average monthly 
pay of men was higher by $3.82, that of women by 59cents. The income and expend- 
iture also increased—the former by $7,039, the latter by $1,680. Decreases, how- 
ever, were noted in the number of public schools, in graded and high schools, in the 
length of school term, in the number of men teaching, and in the persons teaching 
snecessive terms. The State superintendent says that many of the schools are ex- 
tremely good, others the reverse; some cities and towns were inclined to erect and 
furnish schepl buildings, others hesitated, but a general upward tendency is noted 
in school matters. 
VERMONT. 
There is less advance to be noted here than in some of the other States, but great 
efforts have to be made to build up the district ungraded schools, which six-sevenths 
of the pupils of the State attend. Indeed, the work of the last two years has been 
largely in the direction of dissipating illiteracy by means of improving the common 
schools. The statistics so far do not show very favorable results, although the school 
term was lengthened about 2} days. The teachers who had attended a Vermont nor- 
mal school numbered 17 more, although there were 43 fewer teachers, the average 
monthly pay of both men and women being greater and receipts and expenditures in- 
creasing. The public school enrolment, however, fell off 646; the number of schools, 
34; average daily attendance, 1,928; and per cent. of attendance on enrolment, 1.9. 
The attendance in private schools was smaller. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
In almost all important items there were decided gains. With an increase of 8,697 
in children of school age, there were 5,182 more pupils enrolled in public schools, 
3,411 more in average membership, and 2,631 more in average attendance; and, as 
the pupils in evening schools, in State charitable and reform schools, in academies, 
and other private schools amounted to 4,931 more than in 1880~81, it is evident that 
the increase of children did not equal the increased number brought under some 
kind of instruction, The regularity of attendance in evening schools greatly im- 
proved. As the means for instruction in day and evening schools, in funds for pay- 
ing teachers, and in the number of teachers employed were fairly up to the addi- 
tional demand for them, and the proportion of teachers trained in normal schools was 
considerably higher, the record for the year is an encouraging one; especially as the 
few surviving remnants of the old district school system were abolished. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
A moderate but encouraging advance nearly all along the line appears from a com- 
parison of the statistics of 1880-’81 with those of 1881-’82. ‘The fact, however, that 
manufactories successfully compete with the schools in securing the attendance of 
children largely accounts for the absence of 13,826 children of school age (1,087 more 
than in 1880~81) from the public schools. With 2,755 additional children, the public 
school enrolment increased 668; there was a larger increase still in the average belong- 
ing, and 529 more pupils than im the previous year were in average daily attendance 
in State common schools. When we add to these 107 more in evening schools and a 
considerable number in private and church schools, it will be seen that the record of 
the State was fairly good, especially as it raised $25,160 more for its free schools, 
spent $41,899 more for them, increased by about $1.50 the average monthly pay of 
school teachers, and added 5 to the number of school buildings, 3 to the number of 
graded schools, and $110,249 to the valuation of school property. 
CONNECTICUT. 
Gain at most points characterizes the year: gain in enrolment out of an increased 
school population, gain in the average attendance on free schools and in attendance
-P-A-G-E-38
XXXVII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
on schools of all kinds, gain in the annual amount received for supporting public 
schools, gain in the number and pay of teachers, and gain, too, on the whole, in the 
gradation of the public schools. A reduction of 24 in the number of school districts 
affords a negative indication of the same tendency, as the district system, with its 
small schools and ill paid teachers, is at present the chief obstacle to ettective school 
work, The percentage of gain in enrolment and attendance, however, was a little 
Jess than in the previous year and public schools were not quite so numerous nor 
maintained quite so long. The State compulsory school law was considerably im- 
proved, and, as there is an excellent and experienced agent to enforce it and a grow- 
ing public sentiment behind it, it is likely to tell on the general school agtendance. 
    MIDDLE ATLANTIC STA’ — NEW YORK. 
The statistics show an increase for the year of over 19,000 in the youth of school 
age and in the number enrolled in public schools, the latter more than keeping pace 
with the former, while the average daily attendance was over 10,000 greater than in 
1881. There were also over 7,000 more pupils attending private or church schools, 
over 3,000 more in academies, 208 more in normal schools, and 245 more in colleges: 
the whole number under instruction being 30,581 more than during the previous year. 
The amounts received and expended for public schools were each nearly half a mill- 
ion more, although the average school term throughout the State was 2 days less. 
Twenty more public school-houses were reported, but the estimated value of school 
property was less by $ The number of men employed as teachers decreased 
by 546, while that of women increased by 953. There were 320 more teachers licensed 
by local officers and 88 more through normal schools; 171 more were employed con- 
secutively 23 weeks or over, and the average monthly pay throughout the State in- 
creased by $1.04, 
  NEW JERSEY. 
The report from this State shows that with 343,897 youth of school age there were 
209,526 enrolled in public schools, of whom 113,532 were in average attendance, 
besides 44,560 in private and church schools, the increase in youth of school age 
being over 8,000, that of enrolinent in the public schools nearly 6,000, and that of 
average daily attendance 3,480. Fewer public school buildings were reported and 
the valuation of school property decreased, but a larger number of sittings for pupils 
was provided. Less money was expended on public schools, but the average term 
throughout the State was 2 days greater. An improvement in the teaching force is 
indicated by an increase of 42 in the number of teachers holding State certificates, 
of 80 in those holding from cities, and of 33 in those having first grade county cer- 
tificates. 
  PENNSYLVANIA. 
As the State takes no census of the children of school age, the number of such 
children is not known; but the public schools increased their enrolment by 13,596 
and (outside of Philadelphia) there were 7,914 more in private and academic schools. 
For the whole State there was an addition of 348 to the number of free schools, of 
555 to the number of graded schools, of 477 to the teachers in free schools, of 
$268,540 to the expenditure for them, of 6.82 days to the school term, and of 
$1,736,239 to the estimated value of school property. In the State, exclusive of Phila- 
delphia, there were 264 more free schools that taught their pupils drawing, 792 more 
that taught them vocal music, 488 more that had uniform text books, 119 more 
school-houses for free schools, 108 more rated as first class, and of the 21,829 teachers 
595 more that had had the benefit of normal school instruction. The private schools 
of higher grade were 6 fewer than before, those of lower grade more numerous by 65, 
and the teachers in them all 109 more numerous. The distinction between schools for 
white and colored pupils was abolished by law, and Philadelphia took a great step 
forward in securing a city superintendent.

  PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. XXXIX 
DELAWARE, 
In the absence of a full report for 1882, no comparisons can be made between the 
school statistics of that and of the previous year. The schools for colored punils under 
the care of the Delaware Association for the Education of the Colored People, with 
the aid of a State appropriation, did better than eyer before, nearly every locality 
that could support a school having had one. 
MARYLAND. 
Maryland reports a year of successful work, with advance in every important par- 
ticular. With 330,500 youth of school age, according to the United States Census of 
1880, there was, in 1882, an increase of 1,036 children enrolled in public schools and of 
3,450 in average daily attendance. There were 19 more public schools taught and 
$47,327 more were expended on them. The report calls attention to the inadequacy 
of teachers’ pay in some of the schools and to the very small enrolment in some of 
the-others. 
VIRGINIA. 
With over half a million youth of school age (according to the census of 1880), 
Virginia, in 1882, reported an enrolment in public schools of 257,362, with 144,904 in 
average daily attendance, an increase for the year of 18,316 in the number enrolled 
and of 10,417 in average daily attendance. The enrolment included over 172,000 
white youth and over 85,000 colored, the total school population comprising nearly 
74,000 more white than colored. Of the whole increased enrolment, 9,947 were white 
children and 8,369 colored, the increase in average attendance being nearly equally 
divided between the two races. ‘There were 205 more public schools taught (123 more 
for white pupils and 82 more for colored), the average term throughout the State 
being nearly a day longer. Almost $57,000 more were expended for public schoois. 
The average monthly pay of teachers increased slightly and 205 more were employed. 
Although a large proportion of this increase was among colored teachers, there were 
still 438 colored schools taught by white teachers. The superintendent calls atten- 
tion to this fact, and says that these schools should be taught by competent colored 
teachers and that many more schools for colored children should be opened. 
: SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES—NORTH CAROLINA. 
Education in 1881-’82 was in a ‘transitional state, an improved school law having 
provided county superintendency. There is promise of a much better state of school 
affairs, but the new machinery is not yet working freely. Partly from this cause, the 
figures as to school attendance are largely on the losing side: with nearly 5,000 
fewer children of school age, the number in public schools was 7,645 less and the 
average attendance reported 10,274 less. School-houses were said to be more numer- — 
ous by 146, but free schools fewer by 354. The number of teachers trained in nor- 
mal institutes and teachers’ pay increased; the decrease reported in receipts for 
schools was apparently due to incomplete reports and school property was repre- 
sented as much more valuable. The average time of schools was 15.9 days longer. 
Great progress was made during the year among the graded schools. 
SOUTH CAROLINA, 
No census of school children has been taken since 1880. The records show that 
during the year 1882 12,516 more children were enrolled in the State schools; that 
average attendance, now first reported as the basis for distribution of school funds, 
was fairly proportionate to the enrolment ; that schools were more numerous by 126; 
that the duration of them averaged 6.66 days more; that teachers increased in num- 
ber apparently enough to meet the increase of pupils, and that average pay, on the 
whole, was about the same as in 1880-81. School expenditures, as incompletely re- 
ported, hardly reached a fair ratio of increase with the enrolment, and school-houses 
were 158 fewer, although 105 new ones were built within the year,
-P-A-G-E-40
xL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
GEORGIA. 
Georgia reports an increase of 35,757 in youth of school age, of 12,235 enrolled in 
public schools, and of 14,272 in average daily attendance, a decrease of 1,647 in the 
number of elementary and academic private schools taught and an increase of 2,242 
in collegiate institutions, 296 more public schools, taught by 223 more teachers, and 
$85,642 more expended for public schools. The large additions to the average attend- 
ance and to the funds for the support of public schools were especially encouraging, 
and the decrease in elementary private schools, together with the other facts men- 
tioned, indicates that the public schools were taking their place. 
FLORIDA, 
The biennial report from this State shows a rapid advance in public school interests 
during the years 1881 and 1882. The statistics for 1882 also show advancement in most 
particulars, although the reports are not sufficiently complete to warrant comparisons. 
More money was spent for teachers’ pay in 1882 in almost every county, and this fact, 
the superintendent says, is worthy of note as indicating an increasing demand for the 
public school and an encouraging growth in educational work. 
GULF STATES— ALABAMA. 
With about 401,000-youth of school age, Alabama reports 177,428 enrolled in public 
schools and 114,527 in average attendance, an increase for the year of about 13,000 in 
school population and of 1,139 in public school enrolment, the average attendance 
being 789 less. There were 52 more public schools taught, but the average term of 
schools throughout the State was shorter by more than 2 days; fewer teachers were 
employed, at less pay ; $7,000 less were expended for public schools; and public school 
property was valued at $21,519 less. The State superintendent appeals to the legis- 
lature for assistance, showing that with present means only a little over 44 per cent. 
of the children were enrolled in school ard only about 28 per cent. were in average 
daily attendance. 
‘MISSISSIPPI. 
There is little information from this State for the year 1882, the last biennial State 
report having covered the years 1880 and 1881. From a written return for 1882, it 
appears that with an increase of 24,168 in school population there was a loss of 17,671 
in average monthly enrolment, of 23,749 in average daily attendence, and of 805 in 
the number of teachersemployed, receipts for schools also falling off nearly a quarter 
of a million dollars, 
LOUISIANA. 
Although there is no official report from the State superintendent for 1882, it abund- 
antly appears from other sources that public school interests were far from satisfactory 
in this State. The poor pay of teachers, the insufficient provision for comfort in rural 
school-houses, the virtual abolition of taxation for schools and the utter inadequacy 
of school funds resulting therefrom, together with the want of a definite school law 
corresponding with the new constitution, combined to make efficient educational 
work almost impossible. 
TEXAS. 
It was stated in the report for 1881 that in a fire at the State capitol the school re- - 
turns of that year had been consumed and that efforts made to duplicate them had 
proved only partially successful. Hence, comparison of the statistics of 1880~81 
and 1881~82 cannot be made, but the absolute record for the latter year appears en- 
couraging : 295,344 school youth, 142,960 brought under instruction in 5,236 schools, 
with an average term of about 100 days, under at least 5,037 teachers ; and, as efforts 
were being made to improve the State school system and to give it both a body of 
professionally trained teachers and county supervision, it may be hoped that the rec- 
ord will be better in the future.

PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. XLI 
SOUTHERN CENTRAL STATES— ARKANSAS. 
In Arkansas an encouraging condition of public school affairs is reported. Preju- 
dice against the system is disappearing and the people are coming to look on the pub- 
lie schools as the only means through which the great part of the school population 
can obtain an education. The statistics, though imperfect, afford abundant proofs 
of progress. With but 16,776 more youth of school age than the previous year, 
there was an increase of 18,952 in public school enrolment, although only about 
half the school districts reported on this point. The superintendent thinks the real 
increase in attendance was about 40,000, or more than twice as great as the increase 
of youth to be educated. Over $115,000 more were expended for public schools. 
Fewer school-houses were built, but these were better adapted to their purpose and 
supplied with improved furniture and apparatus, 
Under the head of General Condition in the abstract, mention was inadvertently 
omitted of the fact that Arkansas received from the Peabody fund, in 1882, $5,075, 
$1,700 being divided among the schools of Pine Bluff, Russellville, and Lonoke ; $1,700 
given for teachers’ institutes, $1,475 for Nashville scholarships, and $200 to an educa- 
tional journal. 
KANSAS. | 
Very gratifying progress in school work 1s apparent in this State in 1881+’82, 
{ncreases are noted in children of school age, in enrolment, in average daily attend- 
ance, in school districts organized and reporting, in districts with three months’ school 
or more, in the average length of school term, and in the number of school rooms, al- 
though there were 116 fewer school-lhouses reported. The women teaching received 
$1.46 more monthly pay on an average and 33 more teachers in private and church 
schools were reported. The receipts and expenditures for public schools increased, 
the former by $228,458 and the latter by $197,839. An increase of $32,109 in the 
amount of available school fund was also reported. Although the value of school 
property fell off $88,018 and fewer men taught (at an average of $7.46 less a month), 
the record as a whole speaks well for the State. 
MISSOURI. 
The schools of Missouri seem to be in a very prosperdus condition, although the sta- 
tistics are far from complete, as many counties failed to report fully. There were 
18,239 more pupils in attendance at the public schools, which were more numerous by 
137, the buildings used for school purposes by 328, and additional sittings by 11,573. 
Teachers numbered 1,306 more; receipts increased $257,016 and expenditures $601,046. 
An apparent decrease in attendance of colored youth at school is explained by the 
fact that 32 counties do not report. Eighteen fewer schools for colored youth are 
mentioned. School property diminished in value $1,089,319. . : 
KENTUCKY. 
In Kentucky, where the years 1879-’80 and 1880-’81 afford the most recent basis of 
comparison available, there was a decrease of 6,918 white youth in free schools and 
of 8,992 in the daily average attendance of whites. The statistics for colored youth 
are not given, so that no comparison can be made of the two years under considera- 
tion. An advance is noted in every other direction, except in the decrease of men 
- teaching. There were 98 more school districts (67 of them for whites), 53 more districts 
having schools for whites and 21 more for colored; 29 more school-houses for white 
youth, valued with their sites at $166,697; and an increase of 104 private schools of all 
grades, The female teachers numbered 369 more than in the previous year. The 
receipts for school purposes are not given for 1880-81, but the expenditures increased 
$381,124,

school work; but since that time, judged from its own roperts, there has been a 
considerable decline. With a growing number to be taught, there have been fewer 
brought into the State schools ; the average attendance, when last shown, in 1881, had 
greatly diminished, as well as schools and school-houses. In funds for the State 
schools there was a decline, but these have increased again. 
WEST VIRGINIA, 
This State reports 216,598 youth of school age (over 208,000 of them being white 
children) ; 155,544 enrolled in public schools, of whom 151,098 were white and 4,446 
colored children; and 96,652 in average daily attendance. The percentage of 
enrolment and of average attendance based on the whole number of school age in- 
creased. The figures also show an increase in the number of schools taught, in the 
amount of money expended for them, in the value of public school property, and in 
the amount of the public school fund, which materially increased during 1881 and 
1882, the apportionment among the counties being the largest ever made in the State. 
The average school term throughout the State was one day longer than the previous 
year. Superintendent Butcher says the general approval and generous aid given 
educational work by members of all professions and callings has been very gratify 
Newspapers and physicians are especially mentioned, the latter for instruction given 
to teachers in school hygiene and other subjects. 
  X NORTHERN CENTRAL STATES— OHIO, 
Although Ohio has not an ideal school system, the good work of many excellent 
school officers tells well in its results. For 1881~82 the figures of the State report 
show gains with few exceptions in all the items: $634,455 larger receipts for public 
schools, an increase of 17,984 school children, 6,343 more enrolled in the State schools 
and 15,091 more in average daily attendance; while, to accommodate these growing 
numbers there were 27 more school-houses (including 96 built during the year), 453 more 
school rooms, and 165 more teachers, at an average pay of $2 a month more for men 
and $1 more for women. The cost of additional school-houses ($1,123,688) shows that 
they must have been generally good, while all the State school grounds and buildings 
were rated $1,506,876 higher than the year before. The only offset to all this advance 
is a doubtful decrease of 595 in colored pupils and of 20 in their teachers, 
INDIANA. 
The statistics of 1882 show a falling off of more than 5,000 in the number of youth 
-of school age and in the number enrolled in public-schools, with a comparatively 
small decrease of 788 imaverage daily attendance, fewer districts in which public 
schools were taught, and a smaller enrolment in private schools. There was, however, 
on the other hand, an increase of $13,261 in the income and of $254,039 in the expen- 
diture for public schools, of $73,806 in the amount of the common school fund, of 60 in 
the number of public school-houses, and of $285,725 in the value of public school prop- 
erty. The superintendent reports, as good evidence of progress, more attention 
given to the mental, moral, and physical education of the children, as well as to 
methods of instruction, greater efforts made to train pupils to think for themselves, 
and more attention given to the formation of character and the inculcation of good 
habits.   
    ILLINOIS. 
This State reported an increase of 35,345 in yonth of school age, of 18,034 in enrol- 
ment in public graded schools, of 15,936 in all public schools, and of 26,627 in average 
daily attendance. There was also an increase of 29 in high schools, and of 38 in the 
number of school buildings erected during the year. There was a decrease of 2,098 
in attendance on ungraded schools, of 22 in public school-houses, and of 270 in

teachers employed. The valuation of all public school property increased by 
$1,220,666, receipts by $358,281, and expenditures by $709,261; the last increase named 
was partly due to an increase in the pay of teachers, which averaged $2.69 a yonth 
for men and $2.27 for women. 
MICHIGAN. 
Michigan reports an increase of more than 20,000 in youth of school age and of 
18,761 in the number enrolled in public schools, the per cent. of school age enrolled 
being about the same as during the previous year; 789 more pupils attended private 
orchurch schools. There were 153 more public school-houses and 27,331 more sittings, 
the value of school property being $463,792 greater; $371,693 more were expended 
for public schools, which were taught in 242 more districts. Fewer men and more 
women were employed as teachers, the average monthly pay of men being increased 
$4.58; that of women, $1.66. 
. WISCONSIN. 
With 495,233 youth of school age, Wisconsin reports 303,452 enrolled in public 
schools, besides 20,967 in private or church schools, an increase for the year of 3,875 
in school population and of 3,330 in public school enrolment, with a decrease of 
over 5,000 attending private or church schools. There were also over 4,000,in nor- 
mal, collegiate, and theological schools. Exclusive of these, counting public and 
private school pupils, a little over 65 per cent. of the school population were under 
instruction during some part of the year. There was an increase in the number of 
high and graded schools, as well as in the whole number of schools taught and of 
teachers employed, the latter including fewer men and more women. A larger num- 
ber of public school-houses were reported, the value of public school property in- 
greasing by $47,305; the average pay of teachers also increased somewhat, although 
the whole expenditure for public schools was less than the amount reported for 1881, 
MINNESOTA, 
With 289,028 youth of school age, this State enrolled 196,643 in public schools, an 
increase for the year of over 13,000; the average daily attendance in winter was over 
12,000 more and in summer it was 2,577 more. There were $435,070 more expended 
on public schools, the available school fund increasing by $464,238 ; 159 more school- 
houses were reported in use and the value of school property was $244,808 higher. 
IOWA, 
The progress made in this State cannot be accurately stated, as the biennial report 
covering the years 1882 and 1883 hasnot yet appeared. From other official sources, how- 
ever, a-few facts are learned. More money was received and expended for school pur- 
poses; the permanent fund was increased by over $185,000 and the estimated value 
of school property by $443,649. The ratio of attendance to enrolment was better, but 
the enrolment itself fell off 24,566 and the percentage of enrolment on school popula- 
tion was 5.3 less; average attendance was 400 less and the average school term was 
6 days, shorter. There were more teachers in the public schools, 502 fewer men and 
807 more women, the average monthly pay of men being $2.70 more and that of 
women 21 cents more. 
  NEBRASKA. 
The progress in educational affairs is quite marked in this State: the enrolment 
s greater by 14,770 pupils, the average attendance by 523; 130 more public school 
districts are reported, 221 more with 6 months’ school and 17 more having graded 
schools; and 108 more public school-houses, increasing the valuation of school property 
$180,415. There were 4 fewer men employed as instructors, but 543 more women, 
who, however, received $3.16 less per month on an average than in the year

XLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
1880-81. Institutes were attended by 395 more teachers, while 9 more counties held 
such institutes. The compensation of county superintendents was slowly increasing, 
yet ch was left to be desired, as the poor pay secured only an inferior class of 
work. Income for public schools iacreased $211,430 and expenditures $201,234, ‘The 
Jength of term in which schools are held is said to have increased 2 days since 
187980. The question of school furniture receives more attention than formerly. 
COLORADO. 
This State shows an increase of 8,403 in the school population, of 4,731 in public 
school enrolment, and of 3,839 in average daily attendance. The proportion of en- 
rolment to school population increased nearly 1 per cent., while that of average at- 
tendance‘to enrolment increased 2 per cent. An increase also appears in other par- 
ticulars. Fiftyssix more school-houses were reported, affording 6,984 more sittings; 
school property was valued at $258,278 more; 99 more teachers were employed; and 
$69,814 more were expended for the public schools, which were taught an average of 
100 days. The State superintendent reports a steady improvement in the coat, of 
the schools as well as an increase in their number. 
STATES ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE—NEVADA. 
A comparison with the previous year shows that, while the enrolment and daily at- 
tendanee of pupils decreased both in public and private schools, while there were 6 
fewer districts voting a district tax, and while the school property diminished $21,260, 
yet in every other way there was a decided advance over 1880~81. There were more 
districts, more public schools, graded and ungraded, and more without rate bills, an 
increased school term, more teachers, both sexes receiving better pay, higher re- 
ceipts and expenditures, and a larger State school fund. 
CALIFORNIA! 
Although an advance is noted in nearly every direction in the educational affairs 
of this State, yet Superintendent Campbell says that the progress made is not entirely 
satisfactory to those who furnish the means for carrying on the work of education. 
An increase in the number of primary and grammar schools was noticeable, The well 
ventilated and the well furnished school buildings outnumbered by 114 and 126 those of 
the previous year. There were 103 more buildings supplied with apparatus. Nearly 
5,000 additional pupils were enrolled in the public schools, while the average daily 
attendance increased 1,636 during the year under consideration. The school property 
reached @ valuation of $240,844 more than in 1880~81. Among teachers a marked 
difference was noted; 116 more held life diplomas, 145 more educational diplomas, 
and 299 more first grade county certificates. There were also 10 more graduates from 
normal schodls employed as instructors. The income for public schools advanced 
$110,568 during the year. The items of decrease were of minor importance. 
OREGON.? 
Oregon makes a very good showing. With 3,600 more school children, 3,245 more 
were gathered into the State free schools and 2,151 more held in average attendance, 
while in other than State schools there were 2,571 more enrolled than the preceding 
year. The number reported as not in any school was thus 327 less than in 1880-81. 
School districts organized were 56 additional; the number reporting their statistics, 
38 more; school terms were lengthened from an average of 86 days to an average of 
90 days; school property increased in value $26,829. Receipts for schools increased 
$15,000 and expenditure for them $28,630; the permanent school fund, $222,522. In 
addition to a normal department at the university two already well established insti- 
tutions were adopted as normal schools.

PRESENT EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. XLV 
THE TERRITORIES — ALASKA, 
Educational work in this vast Territory is still entirely dependent on private be- 
nevolence. Letters from Rey. Sheldon Jackson, D. D., and Mr. Ivan Petroff shgw the 
following facts : 
In the southeastern section of the Territory, known as as the Alexander Archipel- 
ago, there were 7 good English,.schools, 3 of which had boarding and industrial 
departments. Six of the 7 were maintained at the expense of the board of home 
missions of the Presbyterian Church, Six of them were among.the Thlinkets and one 
among the Hydah speaking people. Over 500 pupils were reported in these schools, 
200 of them belonging to the school at Sitka. 
In the southwestern section the only schools were one sustained by the Russo- 
Greek Church, at Belkovsky, and 3 by commercial companies, one of the latter at 
St. Paul, with 69 in average attendance, and the other at St. George, with 22. No 
other educational facilities are afforded the people of Southwestern Alaska, although 
among them in the principal trading centres are several thousand people of mixed 
blood, who, under Russian rule, had made considerable advance in civilization. 
About 500 of this class out of 8,000 or 9,000, it is estimated, are able to read and 
write their own language, and perhaps a fourth of this number the Russian lan- 
guage also. 
There is perhaps no portion of United States territory that stands in greater need 
of national aid for school work than this. Certainly the efforts already made by 
churches and by private benevolence have been and are being amply rewarded.! 
ARIZONA. 
The statistics from this Territory are toomeagre to afford a basis for satisfactory com- 
parison of the school work of 1882 and previous years. A territorial school census 
  
1 As this report is going through the press, the House of Representatives, on the 14th of May, 1884, 
passed the Senate bill providing a civil government for Alaska, which was signed by the President on 
the 17th. # 
This act creates a governor at a salary of $3,000, a judge at $3,000, a district attorney at $2,500, a 
marshal at $2,500, a clerk at $2,500, four commissioners at $1,000 each and fees, and four deputy mar- 
shals at $750 each and fees. 
‘These officers are appointed by the President, with the exception of the deputy marshals, who are 
appointed by the marshal. 
The seat of government is established at Sitka. The four commissioners and four deputy marshals 
are to reside respectively at Sitka, Wrangell, Juneau, and Unalashika. 
‘The laws of Oregon, so far as applicable, are extended over the district. A term of the district 
court is to be held each year at Sitka, commencing on the first Monday of May, and one at Wrangell, 
beginning on the first Monday in November. No provision is made for a territorial legislature or a 
delegate in Congress. The genoral land laws of the United States are not extended over the country. 
‘The squatter rights of Indians and others are recognized. Mission stations are continued in the‘occn. . 
pancy of the 640 acres now claimed by them. ‘The owners of mining claims can perfect their titles in 
the usual way. 
The governor is required to inquire into the operations of the Alaska Cammercial Company and 
annually report to Congress the result of such inquiries and any and all violations by said company 
of the agreemont existing between the United States and suid company. 
The Secretary of the Interior is directed to select two of the officers, who, together with the gover- 
nor, shall constitute a commission to examine into and report upon the condition of the Indians residing 
in said Territory; what lands, if any, should be reserved for their use; what provision shall be made 
for their education; what rights by occupation of settlers should be recognized, and all other facts 
that may be necessary to enable Congress to determine what limitations or conditions should be im- 
posed when the land laws of the United States shall be extended to said district. 
‘The importation, manufacture, and sale of intoxicating liquors in said district, except for medicinal, 
mechanical, and scientific purposes, are prohibited. 
The Secretary of the Interior is directed to make needful and proper provision for the education of 
the children of school age in the Territory of Alaska, without reference to race, until such time as 
permanent provision shall be made for the same, and the sum of $25,000 is appropriated for this 
purpose. 
‘Thus, after seventeen years of delay, a government has been secured for Alaska. In respect to this 
successful result this Bureau has endeavored to do its whole duty by obtaining trustworthy information 
in regard to the condition of the inhabitants and their educational needs, and by furnishing it to the

shows 10,283 youth of school age; but the number attending schools, either public or 
private, is not given. More public school teachers were employed than during 1880~81 
and $3g,640 more were expended on the schools. A uniform series of textbooks was 
adopted, which had facilitated the work of teachers and the progress of their pupils. 
The superintendent says the schools are in need of that general supervision which the 
insufficiency of legislative appropriation prevents hin from giving, although required 
by law, and that they also need more local supervision than the probate judge, who 
acts as county superintendent, can find time to give. 
  DAKOTA. 
Dakota reports a school population of 38,815, with 25,451, or about 65 per cent., en- 
rolled in 41 graded and 981 ungraded public schools, 16 counties haying failed to re- 
port in respect to all these items. No comparison can be made between 1881 and 1882, 
in respect to these points, in the absence of any report for the former year. The 
insufficiency of reports from this Territory is ascribed partly to the neglect of local 
supervisors and partly to a municipal system quite independent of territorial au- 
thority, which is rapidly removing the more populous places from the superintendent’s 
control, 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
As the statistics of District schools have not been furnished for 1882, no comparison 
of the educational condition of the District between this year and 1881, can be made, 
except in regard to the funds received and expended for public schools. Each of 
these figures in 1882 amounted to $579,312,-against $555,644 received and $527,312 
expended in 1881, an increase for the year of $52,000 applied to public school pur- 
poses. 
The city of Washington, with a white school population of 27,142, enrolled 17,306 
in public schools, of whom 13,168 were in average daily attendance, besides 5,000 in 
private schools. Thepublic schools were taught 186 days, in 54 buildings, containing   
Government officers and to the people. In this effort Prof. W. H. Dalk of tho United States Coast Sur- 
yey, and Rey. G. H. Atkinson, D. D., of Oregon, were especially helpful. 
The report of this Office for 1870 had a notice of education in Alaska, and year after year these no- 
tices were continued as data warranted. 
In 1876 the Commissioner of Education, as representative of the Department of the Interior, ex- 
pended a portion of the funds at his control to secure a representation of native life in Alaska for the 
Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. 
In February, 1882, a special report from this Office on education in Alaska, recommending an appro- 
priation of $50,000 for schools, was made to the Secretary of the Interior, and by him forwarded to 
Congress through the President. 
In 1877 Rev. Sheldon Jackson, D. D., superintendent of Presbyterian missions for the Rocky Mount- 
ain Territories, having had his attention called to Alaska, visited the southeastern portion, and 
_ established the first American school in that section on the 10th of August, 1877, with Mrs. A. R. Me- 
Farland, as teacher. Later, he established schools at Sitka, Haines (Chilkats), Boyd (Hoonyahs), 
and Jackson (Hydahs); Returning to the States, Dr. Jackson commenced an agitation to arouse the 
dormant public sentiment of the country in behalf of « government and schools for Alaska. He held 
public meetings in many of tho leading cities and many of the prominent towns from the Pacific to 
the Atlantic, delivering from 1878 to 1884 about nine hundred addresses on Alaska. He went before 
committees of the Forty-Sixth, Forty-Seventh, and Forty-Eighth Congresses, and with unflagging zeal 
sought to enlist the interest of congressmen. He secured the hearty coiperation of the missionary 
societies of the Baptist, Methodist, Congregational, Episcopal, Moravian, and Presbyterian churches. 
In 1880 he published a book on Alaska, and on March 23, 1882, delivered an address before the 
Department of Superintendence of the National Educational Association, which was printed by this 
Bureau in Circular of Information No. 2, 1882. Of this circular three editions have been called for, 
making an aggregate of 60,000 copies. During the summer of 1883, he visited the twenty-second an- 
nual meeting of the National Educationa jociation of the United States, the second National Edu- 
cational Assembly, and the State teachers’ associations of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
and Connecticut, each of which passed strong resolutions asking Congress to provide a school system 
for Alaska, 
‘Through these meetings the teachers became interested, and thousands of petitions from teachers, 
scattered from Maine to Texas and from Florida to Oregon, were sent to congressmen, asking for 
schools for Alaska. So persistent and continuous was the pressure invoked by Dr. Jackson from so 
many, varied, and widely separated forces, that when the bill was reached Congress passed it with 
great unanimity.

IDAHO. . 
There were 9,650 youth of school age reported in 1882, but the number under in- 
struction was not given. Two hundred teachers were employed in public schools, 25 
more than in 1881; men received $60 a month and women $50; $46,855 were expended. 
for public schools, about $2,000 more than the year before. 
The superintendent complains of embarrassments resulting from defects in the 
school system and lack of funds. Being an ex officio superintendent, with only a part 
of his time for school work and no salary as superintendent, his supervision of school 
interests is necessarily imperfect, and the same is true of county superintendents. 
Attention is also called to the absence of any provision for teachers’ institutes, to 
the small pay of teachers and lack of care in selecting them, and to the short school 
terms, covering but 3 months in many districts. 
INDIAN TERRITORY. 
Among the 262,366 Indians reported in the United States, exclusive of Alaska, there 
are, it is believed, over 44,000 within the school age, of whom upwards of 35,000 be- 
long to tribal Indians and over 9,000 to the Five Nations in the Indian Territory. 
There were enrolled in schools of all kinds 14,394 Indian youth, or less than*33 per 
cent. of the whole number, a loss for the year of 544 in the Five Nations and a gain 
of 646 among the tribal Indians. With this slightly increased attendance among the 
tribal Indians there was considerable advance in the number of teachers and mis- 
sionaries employed and in the whole expenditure for Indian schools. All the statis- 
tics received, as also the concurrent reports, indicate a steady advance in Indian 
eflucation. 
MONTANA. 
With 10,484 youth of school age, Montana reported 6,054 enrolled in public schools 
in 1882 and 3,558 in average attendance, an increase for the year ofover 1,000 in school 
population, of nearly that number enrolled in public schools, and of 758 in average 
attendance. There were 25 more schools taught; the average term increased by 15 
days; moré teachers were employed at an increased salary, and $9,577 more were 
raised for school purposes, the last being due to the increased value of property, as 
the rate of taxation was one-tenth of g mill less than during the previous year. 
NEW MEXICO. 
Education in New Mexico is far from flourishing. As there is no territorial super- 
intendent and, in fact, no system of public free schools, no statistics are reported. 
UTAH. 
There were here over 43,000 youth of school age and over 27,000, or nearly 63 per 
cent,, enrolled in public schools, with 17,594 in average attendance, the latter being 
over 1,000 less than in 1881. Public schools were taught an average of 139 days, one 
less than the previous year, and $18,726 less were expended on them, although 14 moro 
teachers were employed. Non-Mormon private schools reported decided gains, 
WASHINGTON TERRITORY.! 
The superintendent of instruction reports a prosperous condition of the schools, 
Scheol districts and school-houses increased in proportion to the increase in popula- 
tion, school buildings were better than they had ever before been, and there was an 
increasing demand for better teachers,

This Territory sends no report for 1882, Except as to thé city of Cheyenne, the 
latest infimation respecting the schools is from the report for 1881 of the governor,

  a In Delaware, in addition to the school tax collected from colored citizens, which has heretofore 
een the only State appropriation for the support of cofored schools, the legislature now appropriates 
annually $2,400 from the State treasury for educating the colored children of the State; in Maryland, 
there is a biennial appropriation; in the District of Columbia, one-third of the school funds is set 
apart for colored public schools; in South Carolina, the school moneys are distributed in proportion to 
the average attendance, without regard to race; and in the other States mentioned above, the schoul 
moneys are divided in proportion to the school population, without regard to race. 
b As far as reported; several counties tailed to make race distinctions.

{g Four counties failing to report. 
hk Number of colored children in Kentucky between the ages of 6 and 20 according to the United 
States Census of 1880; in 1882 the schogl age for colored children was changed by law from 6-16 to 6-20. 
i According to return for 1880; since then the legal school age for colored children has been length- 
ened hy four years. 
j For 1881; in 1882 the per capita of the white child of legal schoo] age and the colored child of legal 
school age was made the same, thus giving to the colored children equal advantages with the white 
children in the common school fund of the State.

CONDITION OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. LV 
From the tabie of comparative statistics of education in the South it appears that 
the white school population of 16 States and the District of Columbia is 4,046,956 and 
enrolment in public schools 2,249,263, the increase over the same as reported in 1881 
being, respectively, 92,356 and 14,386. The colored school population is 1,944,572; 
enrolment, 802,982; the increase, respectively, 15,385 and 610. 
For Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the District of Columbia the 
figures for enrolment are the same as in 1881; Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, 
South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia report increased enrolment for both 
races; Arkansas and North Carolina, increase for the whites only ; Maryland, for the 
colored only; while in Texas and Tennessee the enrolment for both races is less than 
that reported in 1881. In the latter State marked progress appears again in 1883. If 
we turn io the report for 1876~77, the first year in which the table under consideration 
was attempted, we shail see clearer evidence of the remarkable work that hasbeen ac- 
complished in the Southern States: as compared with the numbers reported in 1876~77, 
white school population shows increase of 13 per cent. ; enrolment, of 23 per cent. Col- . 
ored school population shows increase of 28 per cent.; enrolment, increase of 40 per 
cent. During the same time the expenditure for public schools in these States and 
the District of Columbia has been steadily increasing. For the successive years since 
1878, the first year for which a separate statement of the amount was given, the 
expenditure has been as follows: 1878, $11,760,251 ; 1879, $12,181,602; 1880, $12,475,044; 
1881, $13,359,784; 1882, $14,820,972. 
The increase in enrolment and funds eorresponds to a radical change in the sen- 
timent of the people. A free impartial system of education is recognized as indispen- 
sable to the future prosperity of the States, and there is a very general disposition to 
establish schools and to make like provision for both races. Louisiana appears now 
to be the only one of the States under consideration in which the prospect is in the 
main discouraging.” 
By reference to the table it will be seen that both races now share alike in the 
school fund, excepting in Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, in which 
special provision is made for the colored race, and in South Carolina, where the basis 
of apportionment is the same for each race but the amounts realized depend upon the 
extent to which the people avail themselves of the provision by absolute attendance 
upon the schools. Since the date of my last report, Kentucky has abolished all dis- 
crimination between the races in respect to the distribution of the school funds, the 
act to that effect bearing date April, 1882. In view of this action in Kentucky, it is 
to be hoped that the disposition manifested in some other States to adopt similar 
invidious distinctions will yield to better counsels. 
While the disposition to deal impartially with both races in respect to school pro- 
vision is so general in the Southern States, it will be noticed that the proportion of 
tbe colored school population enrolled in the schools is very much less than that of 
the white school population. The reasons are apparent to every one personally famil- 
iar with the situation of affairs in this section. There are few school buildings for 
the use of the colored peopie, the supply of teachers is extremely limited, while the 
poverty of the people, their irregular habits, and capricious moods interfere with their 
school attendance, especially in the country districts. These are, however, all minor 
difficulties, the most serious obstacle to the practical fulfilment of the school laws in 
the Southern States being the want of funds. 
It is unnecessary to repeat here the proofs of the statement that the Southern 
States cannot of themselves bear the whole burden of the instruction and develop- 
ment of the freedmen: the fact is admitted; the responsibility of the nation in the 
matter is admitted; there appears to be an overwhelming sentiment in the country 
in favor of appropriations from the National Treasury to meet the emergency, and 
a determined effort will be made to secure from Congress at its next session the 
measure of relief desired. The preparation of teachers for the colored schools is at 
present the most important end to be acccmplished. The special provision for this

training is set forth in the table of normal schools, which gives a total of 56 schools, 
having 8,509 students and 307 instructors, as against 47 schools, with 7,621 students 
and 258 instructors, in 1881. The schools for secondary instruction, colleges, univer- 
sities, and schools of theology also contribute to this work of preparing teachers. It 
will be seen that all classes of schools for the colored people above the elementary 
grade depend largely for their support upon the various religious denominations, 
whose zeal and liberality in the cause of the elevation of the freedmen continue with. 
out abatement, i 
Schools of law number 4, with 16 instructors and 53 students, as against 3 schools, 
with 12 instructors and 45 students, in 1881. One additional school of medicine is re- 
ported, with a total for the 3 schools of 23 instructors and 125 students, as against 18 
and 116, respectively, in 1881. The total number of schools of all classes reported is 
16,086, against 17,375 in 1881. The enrolment is greater than that reported in 1881, 
viz, 821,380, as against £18,365. 
Sincé my last report two notable benefactions have been made to promote educa- 
tion in the Southern States: 
In March, 1882, John F. Slater, of Norwich, Conn., gave $1,000,000 to several gentle- 
men in trust for the education of the freedmen of the South. Dr. A. G. Haygood 
was appointed general agent for the distribution of the fund, and entered at once 
upon a careful investigation of the field. Although his first report has not yet been 
published, he has already given some indication of the action he will recommend. 
The need of provision for the industrial training of the freedmen is especially empha- 
sized by Dr. Haygood. 
In June, 1882, Mr. Paul Tulane, of Princeton, N, J., executed a trust deed convey- 
ing to certain persons incorporated under the name of ‘The Administrators of the 
Tulane Education Fund” certain real estate in the city of New Orleans, La., for the 
promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, and industrial education among 
the white persons in the city of New Orleans, and for the advancement of letters, the 
arts, and sciences therein. In 1883 this gift was increased by a further donation in 
cash, stocks, and bonds. The total value of the benefaction is placed at $701,926.

The disbursements from the Peabody fund amount for 1882 to $80,334, a larger sum 
than has been reported in any single year since 1877. In addition to the substantial 
aid afforded by the money an immense impetus has been given to the cause of educa- 
tion by the efforts of the general agent, Hon. J. L. M. Curry, tu. p, Legislation has 
been stimulated by his eloquent appeals, while his counsel has determined many prac- 
tical details of school organization and his vigilant supervision has been felt through- 
out the States participating in the benefit of the fund. A striking evidence of the 
estimation in which the service of the board of trustees and the personalinfluence of 
the general agent are held is furnished by a memorial of May 3, 1883, addressed to 
the trustees of the Peabody fund by certain citizens of Louisville, Ky. The memo- 
rialists pray that Kentucky may henceforth be included in the operations of the board 
and that the general agent shall be authorized to address the Kentucky legislature 
on the subject of education, “ laying before them the results of his reflection and ex- 
perience on this great subject.” 
The prosperity of the Normal College, Nashville, Tenn., seems to be permanently 
assured, Dr. Curry reports that— 
The Normal College seems to be acquiring, by its excellence of instruction and man- 
seomenh a stronger hold upon the people of Tennessee. * * * The State board of 
education, at their meeting in June, assured the Peabody trustees of their hearty 
coéperation in efforts to promote the success of the college and to elevate the standard 
of education, and they memorialized the legislature to appropriate $10,000 to the 
Normal College and $2,500 to the Colored Normal Institute. 
The State board petitions the trustees of the Peabody fund to grant scholarships to 
Tennessee on the same footing as they are granted to other States, which request Dr. 
Curry advises the board to grant whenever and so long as Tennessee shall give an- 
nually to the college $10,000 free from all incumbrances. The amount of the Peabody 
fund devoted to Nashville scholarships for the year ending October 1, 1882, was 
$18,525, in addition to which sum $9,000 were appropriated to the college. 
The course pursued by the trustees and the agent of the Peabody fund in concen- 
trating the money‘upon the training of teachers has accomplished more than any other 
single agent in creating throughout the South a just appreciation of the paramount 
importance of this part of public school work.

LXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
School population and accommodation.— Table II presents the school statistics of 263 
cities having a population, according to the Census of 1880, of 10,918,638. Diminishing 
this population by that of the 24 cities in the table for which school population is not 
reported, we have for 239 cities a total population of 9,474,730, the corresponding 
school population being 2,859,287, or 31 per cent. of the total. 
A glance at the column of school ages will show that the reported school popula- 
tion must be larger than the number of youth of the ages included in the usual 
period of school attendance. This latter number, which for convenience we may des- 
ignate as actual school population, would bear a ratio to total population varying 
in different sections; for instance, in Massachusetts, where the legal school age cor- 
responds with the ordinary period of attendance, and consequently legal and actual 
school population differ but slightly, if at all, the sckool population of the cities tabu- 
lated ranges from 16 to 20 per cent. of the total population. In some of the frontier 
States the proportion of school population wouk be even smaller, but on the whole the 
ratio that obtains in Massachusetts would be too low for the country at large. The 
ratio which the children between 3 and 13 years of age in England are found to bear 
to the whole population (viz, 23 per cent.) may be employed as affording an ample 
estimate of the actual school population in our country. Using 23 per cent. asa 
basis of reckoning we may arrive at a more correct idea of the school provision in our 
cities than can otherwise be formed. 
The school population and school accommodation of 196 cities that report both items 
are, respectively, 2,473,317 and 1,114,560, or an accommodation for 45 per cent. of the 
legal school population and for 13 per cent. of the entire population.of these cities. 
The deficiency of accommodation when represented as equal to 55 per cent. of the 
legal school population seems enormous, but if actual school population be reckoned 
at 23 per cent. of the entire population the deficiency of accommodation is then seen 
to be equal to 10 per cent. of the entire population, that is, 811,940 places. Thismum- 
ber is still, however, larger than the true deficiency, as will be seen when pea in 
private schools is taken into account. 
For 187 cities reporting the items previously considered, together with estimated 
enrolment in private schools, we have a population of 7,928,869; school population, 
2,411,414; sittings in public schools, 1,087,210; estimated enrolment in private schools, 
371,922, or a total school accommodation of 1,459,132. Reckoning the actual school 
population at 23 per cent. of the total population, as heretofore explained, 364,507 
places would be required to meet the deficiency. 
For the supply of this deficiency there still remains the provision in institutions for 
special classes, viz, orphans, deaf-mutes, &c., besides which, allowance must be made 
for children permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. 
Upon the most favorable interpretation of the figures, the deficiency of accommoda- 
tion in a number of cities occasions, and properly, great solicitude. The table indicates 
very plainly where the deficiency is excessive. In the southern cities the evil is 
attributable to the recent date of free schools; in northern cities, to the rapid increase 
of population. It is evident that in the great commercial and industrial centres ap- 
propriations must be allowed and provision made for anticipating this increase in 
the school accommodation. 
School enrolment.— As pointed out in former reports, the statistics of enrolment in the 
schools will lead to false conclusions unless the difference in the legal school age in 
the cities be keptin mind. The following computations show for a certain number of 
cities the percentage enrolment is, first, of school population ; second, of total popu- 
lation; also, the difference expressed in percentage between the percentage of enrol- 
ment on total population and 23 per cent. of the total population. It will be evi- 
dent from an examination of these figures that enrolment bears a much larger ratio to 
23 per cent. of the population than it does to the legal school population, or, in other 
words, the record of enrolment appears much more satisfactory when compared with

compared with all those enumerated in the legal school population.

The following table will serve to indicate the importance that attaches in England 
to exact statements of the condition of school accommodation and enrolment. The 
school boards of the larger cities of England go further than our own city boards in 
anticipating the growth of population; at the same time the enrolment is kept well 
up to accommodation and in many cities exceeds it. lt is assumed by the educational 
department of England that six-sevenths of the population are of the class whose 
children ought to be found in the public elementary schools.

    School attendance.—School attendance is a matter demanding even more serious con- 
sideration than accommodation and enrolment. There are certain uncontrollable 
causes of irregular attendance, as epidemics and extremely bad weather ; but in gen- 
eral it may be said that if the provision made for the instruction of youth isnot made 
use of it argues culpable indifference on the part of parents or poor schools and 
defective administration, all of which conditions are opposed to the public welfare.

  CITY SCHOOLS. LXXVII 
The foregoing figures would seem to indicate very unequal results in the several 
cities from the endeavor to maintain regularity of school attendance. In a measure 
this difference may be attributable to the different social classes represented in the 
schools. Wherever the lawless classes or those who are driven by necessity or av- 
arice to profit by the iabor of children are in great numbers it becomes difficult to 
secure a high average of attendance. The remedies for this evil are obligatory laws, 
attractive schools, instruction adapted to the practical demands of the community, 
and perpetual vigilance in the use of these corrective agencies. The following state- 
ments are from the reports of cities in which unusual attention has been given to the 
subject of attendance. 
In Boston the schools are taught forty weeks in the year and the law compels 
attendance twenty weeks. Any child who has complied with the lawin this particu- 
Jar may obtain a certificate, which protects the child and his employer during the 
period of allowed absence from school. With reference to the operation of this sys- 
tem the superintendent, Hon. E. P. Seaver, says: 
In some of the schools the work is much broken in upon by the constant departure 
and return of this class of pupils. * * * I would therefore recommend that the 
committee on truant officers consider the propriety of making it the duty of the prin- 
cipal of each grammar school to keep a record of the names, ages, and residences of 
all holders of the certificates of twenty weeks’ attendance, together with the dates of 
issue and expiration. It would be well, also, to record the names of their employers, 
so far as these could be ascertained. * * * When such records have been: kept a 
year or two information may be gathered from them, in the light of which another 
important question may be considered, and that is whether the needs of children who 
must work a part of the time while getting an education would not be better served 
by a system of so-called half time schools, or half time classes, than by the present 
system. Would it not be better if these children could go to school half the time 
throughout the year instead of going all the time through only half the year? The 
practical aspects of this question I am not now prepared to consider; but I am con- 
vinced of its importance, and suggest it now, trusting that I may receive the benefit 
of all the practical wisdom which can be brought to bear uponit. From the prin- 
cipals of the grammar schools especially this aid is expected. 
In view of the showing of the census with reference to the number of children in 
Baltimore who do not attend school and are in danger of growing up in ignorance and 
vice, the superintendent, Hon. H. A. Wise, says: 
' [ think it is advisable to try the experiment of establishing a number of half day 
schools in the city for the benefit of this class of children. 
Some discussion having arisen with reference to school attendance in Cincinnati, 
the superintendent of schools, Hon. J. B. Peaslee, made a careful analysis of the sta- 
tistics bearing upon the subject with the following results, as given in his own lan- 
guage: % 
By careful estimates, based upon the school statistics for the past year, there were 
in Cincinnati 8,809 children between the ages of six and fourteen years who were not 
enrolled in school. (Fourteen years is the average age at which pupils complete 
our course of study below the high schools, and is practically the limit of school 
age in most of our cities.) Of these, children under fourteen years not enrolled, 
many are from well-to-do families, where the parents do not believe in sending 
their little ones to school before they are seven or eight, and, in some cases, even 
nine or ten years of age, preferring to give them instruction at home. Again, a 
large part of this number left the intermediate schools (6th, 7th, and 8th years), some 
of thew after having completed the entire grammar school course; another large 
part left the district schools (first five years) at the completion of the course, or after 
an attendance of from three to nearly five years; and some, of course, after an attend- 
ance for a less time. Again a large percentage left church and private schools after 
a corresponding attendance. It is evident, therefore, that there are comparatively 
few children (the first class referred to above excepted) between the ages of six and 
fourteen years who never attended school, and many of these belong to the physi- 
cally or mentally unfortunate. In my opinion the actual number of children over 
ten years of age, born and brought up in our northern cities, who never attended 
school at all and who are physically and mentally able to do so, is but a small per- 
centage of the youth of school age; certainly not many of this class can be found in 
Cincinnati. The number who cannot read and write is still less.

LXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Upon the question of truancy, Hon. Joseph O’Connor, deputy superintendent of 
public schools, San Francisco, gives the following opinion, quoting the section of the 
rules.of the board respecting truancy : 
*« Habitual truancy shall constitute good cause for suspension or expulsion of the 
pupil from school.” For many years I believed this a most inadequate punishment, 
for the reason that it sentenced the pupil to undergo the idleness he enjoyed. I con- 
sidered that the unreasonableness of the act and the want of governing power in 
the parent made it incumbent upon the teacher to work upon the pupil’s fears, and 
hence that corporal punishment was the proper corrective. I am slowly changing my 
mind on this subject. My experience tells me that the free enjoyment of a bath in 
the surf, a stroll among the hills, or a ramble along the sea wall is often sutticient to 
overcome the fear of a whipping; that the tendency to truancy is often inherited ; 
that the parents frequently detain their children at home for the most frivolous rea- 
sons, thus disposing them to consider truancy a trivial offence; and that parents 
often not only give expression to this sentiment in the presence of their children, but, 
also in their presence, misinform the teacher as to the cause of the absence. I be- 
lieve the parents are to blame for at least 80 per cent. of the truancy. Why, then, 
should boys who are allowed by their parents to persist in the vice be permitted to 
continue in schools where they are likely to exert a bad influence upon their weak 
classmates ? 
Upon the same subject, Hon. J. M. B. Sill, superintendent of schools, Detroit, Mich., 
says: 
We have at last, through the efforts of many friends of good order, and especially 
through the judicious persistence of the Hon. John Devlin, of this city, a law which 
puts it into the power of this board to place some restraint upon the juvenile disord- 
erly persons who infest certain localities of Detroit, and to do something towards 
correcting the evil of truancy and youthful incorrigibility. * * * This lawem- 
powers boards of education in cities like Detroit to establish ungraded schools for the 
instruction and, if possible, the reformation of the class of children under considera- 
tion. It also empowers the board to compel the attendance of such children upon 
instruction, under penalty of confinement in one of the State reform schools. 
As soon as the finances of the board will justify moderate expenditures for this 
purpose there should be no further delay in the establishment of a central ungraded 
school, such as this law contemplates and authorizes. 
For the present, a single room, * * * equipped with suitable school furniture 
and apparatus, made as comfortable and attractive as possible, and presided over by 
a firm, but humane and intelligent teacher, will meet wants and conditions, 
Lhope the board will see its way clear to the establishment of such a school and 
to the opening of the same early in the next school year. 
The board of education of New York City has made the enforcement of the compul- 
sory law one of the duties of the city superintendent, who has at his disposal in car- 
rying it out the service of twelve assistants, known as agents of truancy. With ref- 
erence to the operation of this department, Hon. John Jasper, the superintendent, 
says, in his report for 1882: ‘ 
That the efficiency of the department grows with time and experience is shown in 
the great success attending the work done in this direction during the year. The 
whole number of non-attendants placed in school was 882, an increase of 480 over the 
year 1881 and an increase of 558 over 1880. 
It seems proper to state that 356 of the 882 were children of Italian birth or parent- 
age, and that the attendance in five primaryalepartments and schools and six cor- 
porate schools increased 1,156 during the year, this increase consisting of the 356 
above mentioned and of nearly 800 other Italian children, whose parents, aroused by 
the action of the department, yoluntarily complied with the law. * * SOF * 
Truancy is another evil which the efforts of the agents abate, During the year 
2,495 cases of truancy called for and received attention at the hands of the officers of 
this department. In the cases of 1,617 a reformation may be said to have been ef- 
fected, as action by the agents was found necessary only once. In the remaining 878, 
the truant disposition was too strong to be thus easily overcome, for 229 were reported 
twice, 77 three times, 22 four times, 13 five times, 1 six times, and 3 ten times during 
the year. The number 345 that might be called more or less incorrigible is thus seen 
to be about 18 per cent. of the total number, a large decrease when compared with 
the returns of the previous year. 
The facts and opinions here presented are sufficient to sho w that the school officers 
of our cities are fully alive to the importance of maintaining a high average of school 
:  
-P-A-G-E-79
  CITY SCHOOLS. LXxIx 
attendance, and that they will accomplish everything possible in this direction witk 
the means at their disposal. 
Location of cities—Table II indicates very plainly a difference in the distribution 
of the population of the various sections of the country that should be kept in mind 
in discussing the conditions affecting education. Of the 263 cities enumerated, 222 are 
in the New England, Middle, and Northern Central States. The ratio of the popula- 
tion of these 222 cities to the entire population of their respective sections is as follows: 
For the New England States, 44 per cent.; for the Middle States, 37 per cent.; and 
for the Northern Central States, 17 percent. In other words, a large proportion of the 
youth of the New England and Middle States come within the operation of the city 
school systems, which is the case only with a small proportion in the remaining sec- 
tions. Not only is it true that a very large proportion of the youth of the New England 
and Middle States is found in the city schools, but, on account of the compactness of 
the population and the facility of communication in those sections, the influence of the 
city schools is readily extended to the rural districts. 
Tendencies.—As contresjof wealth and population, cities, it must be allowed, possess 
great advantages for the work of public education. At the same time the magnitude 
of the undertaking, whether considered in reference to the number of youth collected 
together or the money and material employed, calls for the most thorough organi- 
zation, and organization implies what is often termed machinery. Machinery— 
schemes, regulations, tests, tabulated representations, &c.—has, it is well known, an 
undue influence oyer minds of a certain order. To them routine is progress, and they 
believein nothing that cannot be formally reported. Education becomes mechanical 
and fruitless when such men have authority to order its conduct or to pass final judg- 
ment upon its results, 
It is important to know as exactly as possible the conditions of attendance, punct- 
uality, and classification in our schools; it is important to have periodical investiga- 
tions and reports upon the condition of school buildings, the use of funds, the progress 
of classes, the results of particular methods, &c.; but a large part, and that the best 
part, of the teacher’s work must be taken on trust. The great end of a year’s school 
effort is accomplished when the average intelligence, aspiration, and moral character 
of the scholars have been advanced, results that cannot be exactly measured and tab- 
ulated. 
“The work of a teacher,” says Professor Laurie, ‘is intellectual and moral, or it 
is a fraud on society. You cannot measure moral forces by a foot rule.” The ten- 
dency to apply the foot-rule measure, once so strong among us, is giving way to the 
exercise of a higher and nobler judgment. Methods of instruction, the spirit that 
pervades the work, the means of adjusting the schools to the ends and uses of com- 
mon life, and of drawing to them the interest of the best minds of the community, 
eligage more and more the attention of school officers. 
In a work so vast and so complicated as a system of city schools, progress involves 
constant change, Methods of organization, instruction, and discipline will be adopted 
at one time that from their very success assume exaggerated importance and come 
eventually to be more regarded than the ends to which they were originally subsidiary ; 
areaction takes place and the method is discarded; subsequent experience discloses. 
the fact that the evil was wrought through the abuse of that which was inherently 
good, and there is a counter-reaction. 
Measures are approyed in one city and condemned at the same time in another, be- 
cause in the one place judgment is determined by their moderate and in the other by 
the effects of their excessive application. The interchange of information between 
the school authorities of the different cities is desirable, as thereby the experience ac- 
* quired in one city may be utilized in another. For this reason I endeavor to embody 
in my annual reports the statements of superintendents and other school officers with 
reference to what may chance to be prominent subjects of interest. Some difficulty 
arises in the eomparison of such statements from the different terms employed in dif-

LXxXx REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ferent cities for the same grade of schools. It would be an advantage, in many ways, 
if the grading were expressed uniformly by numbers or letters and each grade corre- 
sponded to one school year. 
The following extracts are from reports for the current year: 
From the report of the school committee of Boston for 1882 it appears that the aver- 
age number of pupils belonging to the primary schools was 24,428; to grammar schools, 
26,695. Out of a total of 51,331 children in the schools June, 1882, there were in the 
primary grades 24,239; of this number 23,453 were between the ages of 5 and 10, in- 
clusive. Three years are included in the primary schools and 6 years in the grammar 
schools of this city. The number of primary scholars in the schools of Baltimore, 
1882, was 15,521 out of a total of 35,649. In this city also primary schools cover 3 
years. The total enrolment in the public schools of Chicago, June, 1882, was 68,614, 
of which number 55,488 were in the primary departments, the course in which occu- 
pies 4 years. In Cincinnati the schools are classified into district, 5 years; interme- 
diate, 3 years; and high, 4 years. Out of an average enrolment in all the schools of 
27,809, the district schools numbered 22,201, Allowing for differences in classification 
the figures show plainly enough that, so far as the number of children affected is con- 
cerned, the primary and lower grammar grades represent the most important part of 
the school work. 
The efforts made within a few years to change the methods of instruction and 
discipline in the primary schools have been closely followed in my annual reports. 
The present aspect of this department in the cities generally may be well summed 
up in the statement of Hon. Samuel I, Dutton, superintendent of schools, New Haven, 
Conn., in his report for 1883: 
The reformation begun some years since in methods of primary teaching has taken 
strong hold during the past year, and the prospects were never better for the wholes 
some, healthful treatment of little children during their first year in school. ‘The 
school sessions have been materially shortened during the summer months, and by 
the introduction of physical drill and other forms of activity life in the school room 
is made less fatiguing and more attractive. Number tables are being supplied as fast 
as teachers are prepared to make a good use of them. A considerable sum has also 
been expended for supplementary reading matter. The benefits of this provision are 
too obvious to need explanation. : 
The following new departure is noted in the report of the Boston school committee 
for 1882: io 
For the first time within the knowledge of this committee, a uniform and systematic 
examination of the first classes of the primary schools was successfully carried out 
last June. The method adopted was in the main the same as that under which the 
peaananing, classes of the grammar schools are examined. The papers were prepared 
yy the board of supervisors and approved by the committee on examinations. The 
examinations were conducted at the same time in each study and with the same ques- 
tions. The results of these examinations were recorded in blanks furnished for the 
purpose, inspected by the supervisors, who added their owu recommendations, and 
submitted to the committee on examinations; and the promotions to the grammar 
schools were made in accordance with the decision of that committee. 
It should be observed that this experiment occurs at a time when there is in. many 
quarters a decided protest against the prevailing system of annual examinations, as 
will be seen by the following statements, the first of which is from the report of Hon. 
Joseph O’Connor, deputy superintendent of common schools, San Francisco, Cal. : 
Ina ange school department attempting to give a practical elementary education 
to more than 40,000 children, the system of written examinations in yogue is, in 
many respects, positively injurious and is totally inadequate as a test of the laborsof 
the teachers and of the progress and standing of the pupils. The course of study 
provides that certain books must be studied to certain pages and paragraphs, mention- 
ing lessons, articles, and, in many instances, the very words to be omitted. It is un- 
derstood that the deputy superintendent shall prepare questions for the examinations, 
taking care not to go outside of the ‘‘ course” in a single word. The children are 
promoted upon percentages obtained in their written answers to these questions, and 
the average director rates the degree of success or failure of the teacher by the pro- 
portion of her pupils so promoted. The natural result is that the great majority of
-P-A-G-E-81
CITY SCHOOLS. LXXXxI 
the teachers (and I do not consider them to blame) spend nearly all their time in 
drilling and preparing the pupils for the annual examinations. 
Under this plan the crammed pupils will appear to best advantage and the cram- 
ming teachers are likely to have the highest reputation. The entire department will 
follow the idiocrasy of the question maker. There will be no correct measure of in- 
tellectual advancement in the student or of pedagogic skill in the teacher. 
When I add that from the time the pupils enter the sixth grade (often sooner) until 
they leave the senior class of the high school—a peifod of at least nine years—they 
are subjected not only annually and semiannually, but monthly and often weekly, 
to the temptation of copying, and otherwise improperly obtaining credit to which they 
are not honestly entitled, I think there cannot be much argument in favor of the 
moral aspect of the written examinations plan. * * * Any person possessing 
. even a slight appreciation of the wear and tear of mental strain must see that the 
labor of conducting the usual annual written examinations is something fearful. The 
teachers must not have charge of their own classes, The pupils sit scarcely a foot 
apart; each one eagerly hoping to obtain the required percentage. The teacher, by 
a cat-like vigilance, is required to enforce honesty upon fifty or sixty persons whose 
undeveloped judgment often recognizes the advantage in the opposite course. Then 
commences the work of poring over quire upon quire of nervously, hurriedly written 
answers which, when deciphered, reflect lines of thought just as different from those 
of the examiner as the reasoning and motivesof the child are from those of the adult. 
If there be a doubt as to the intended meaning, the child is not present, as in oral ex- 
aminations, to explain. When the papers are marked and returned to the class ex- 
amined the objections of pupils, parents, and teachers to the crediting come thick and 
fast. These troubles settled, the credits must be entered upon the proper records, the 
percentages calculated, and certificates made out and issued. When one considers 
what it must be to hold fourteen examinations, with attendant difficulties as described, 
between the 9th and 25th of the month—a peo embracing thirteen school days—he 
must certainly be amazed at the power of endurance possessed by the average San 
Francisco teacher. I am happy to state that with the assistance of the inspector and 
of the late deputy, Mr. D. C. Stone, who was engaged with us during sixteen days 
of our busiest time, we were enabled at the close of our last school year to reduce the 
number of written examinations to seven (including French and German, which were 
given in the cosmopolitan schools only), and these were scattered over a period extend- 
ing from April 11to May 31. The rules also allowed the promotion by the principals, 
upon evident fitness, of not ‘ more than 50 per cent. of the pupils of any class.” 
I have made the foregoing digression to show: 
(1) The necessity for a better system of examination; (2) some of what has already 
been accomplished by the appointment of one inspector. 
On: the, basis of Mr. Leggett’s oral examinations in 1873, one inspector working 
steadily can examine 107 grammar classes in half the school year. Primary classes 
can be examined more quickly. Mr. Leggett was a rapid and able examiner. He 
was and is an indefatigable worker. Hence I think from 120 to 125 classes, one-third 
of the number grammar and two-thirds primary, would be as many as any person 
could thoroughly examine twice a year. Fras 
Some of the advantages, then, of a proper system of inspection and oral examina- 
tion would be: 
(1) A large direct money saving. 
(2) A very much larger indirect saving by preventing loss of valuable time. 
(3) An improvement of the moral tone of our children by doing away with their 
greatest stimulus to falsehood and cheating. . 
(4) The improvement of the methods and teaching power of the instructors, under 
the suggestion and advice of the inspectors. 
(5) The deliverance of both teachers and pupils from the periodical overexcite- 
ment consequent upon written examinations. 
From report of Hon. Sylvester Brown, superintendent of public schools, Quincy, 
Mass. : 
It was formerly the custom to promote pupils from grade to grade, provided they 
attained an average of a stated percentage of correct answers on an examination or 
a series of examinations. More recently those pupils have been promoted whom 
their teachers named as being qualified for advancement. Experience has shown 
that there will be a percentage of good and studious pupils whose names the honest 
teacher will be forced to omit from the list of those qualified to go on to the next 
higher grade with their classmates. The aim of the common school should be to do 
the g di test good to the greatest number, and teachers should never overlook the 
fact that the schools are exclusively for the children. The question to be answered 
in making promotions is not ‘‘Has this child as good and clear a mind as his class- 
mates?” but ‘‘Will this child be less fitted for the duties of life if he goes on with 
the pupils of his class and works with them the succeeding year?” 
E—VI   
-P-A-G-E-82
  LXXXII_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
After giving a good deal of thought to this subject, I have come to the conclusion 
that promotions should include the whole class, with very rare exceptions, after the 
first two years of the child’s school life, until he reaches the first class in the gram- 
mar school. If children are left in the same grade for two or more years they be- 
come discouraged, and the benefit derived from this repetition of studigg is not at all 
commensurate with the time that is lost. It must be understood, however, by par- 
ents and children that no one is entitled to promotion unless his teacher can con- 
Acienuionsly recommend him as a pupil who has worked according to the best of his 
ability. 
« From report of Hon. Samuel T. Dutton, superintendent of public schools, New 
Haven, Conn. : 
In order to relieve the pressure upon both teachers and pupils, a simpler marking 
system has been devised which, if used intelligently, takes only one-fourth the time 
of the old method and does not demand that the teacher shall sit while teaching with 
pencil in hand to record the percentage value of recitations. 
The annual examination as a basis of promotion in primary and grammar schools 
has been dispensed with, and, while occasional tests, both written and oral, are applied, 
panebale and teachers are urged to use them as a means rather than an end of 
teaching. 
Grammar grades.—The examinations here referred to affect thé grammar schools 
chiefly, the department of the public schools which just now stands most in need of 
attention. 
The age of pupils is a matter to be carefully considered in the arrangement and con- 
duct of studies for this grade. The consideration is forcibly presented in the follow- 
ing observation by Hon. J. L. Brewster, superintendent of schools, Lawrence,Mass. : 
Icannot contemplate without deep solicitude the operation of the factory law in 
diminishing the numbers in our grammar schools, because many of the common 
branches of study, which all agree are necessary to intelligent citizenship in all the 
walks of life,cannot be taught in schools of lower grades, where, of necessity, the 
time is spent upon work of a much more fundamental character —largely abstract — 
training the perceptive faculties and the like, without which no common school edu- 
cation can be of much value. The criticism is often made that pupils do not make 
the progress in the city schools that they do (or rather did forty years ago) in the 
country schools, where the terms of school are much shorter. The fact is that the 
pupils in those schools were much older, possessed of more mature minds, inhabiting 
the bodies of young men and young women, not those of small boys and girls. One 
- of the hindrances of the city schools is that, influenced as we are by the shortness of 
the school life of a majority of the pupils, we have drifted and are still drifting too 
far in the direction of crowding in quantity, forgetting quality, in attempting to do for 
children between nine and twelve years of age what ought not to be attempted for 
the average child until three years later, between twelve and fifteen. It is true that 
some few can do the work as now attempted, with profit, but not so the average; and 
it is the average child who must be the standard in any scheme of public education. 
Physical and mental maturity —the product of time—is necessary to the successful 
prosecution of most of the workin the grammar school course, An additional com- 
pulsory year, extending the limit to fifteen years, would do much to aid our grammar 
schools, or rather to aid the children to prepare for usefulness in life. 
Memoriter and cramming processes are sure to be resorted to whenever the chief 
aim in a course of instruction is to carry the pupils through a given quantity of work, 
irrespective of their ability to comprehend it. Temporary results may thus be ob- 
tained, which are the more hurtful the more they are showy andimposing. A casein 
point is furnished in the report of the superintendent of Quincy schools, Sylvester 
Brown: 
In the study of arithmetic we rarely see results attained at all commensurate with 
. the time and energy expended. This is beeause teachers, committeemen, and 
svperintendents, who were educated at a time when arithmetic was the almost uni- 
versal hobby, cannot rid themselves of the idea that pupils must get as much knowl- 
edge of the subject now as pupils formerly did who were several years older. So itis 
not often that a lesson is given or an examination made that does not contain some 
features in advance of the inimature minds of the pupils. Perhaps I cannot make plain 
to you my meaning better than by the following illustration: While inspecting a B 
grammar room I saw this problem placed upon the board, which the pupils were ex- 
pected to perform: ‘A grocer’s quart measure was too small by half a gill. How 
much did he thus dishonestly make in selling four barrels of cider, averaging 34 galls.,

2 qts., 1 pt., each, if the cider was worth 24 cents‘a gallon?” This is not an isolated 
case; it is only one of the many problems which teachers continually give and exam- 
iners require that are wholly above the heads of children and can only be solved by 
an adult with a pretty clear head forreasoning, Such problems.are not only useless, 
but are posigively pernicious, by putting obstacles in their way that it is impossible 
for them to overcome, thus causing them to become discouraged. Iconfess to having 
seriously misjudged children as to their powers of logical reasoning, and shall here- 
after in my examinations confine myself to those topics in arithmetic in their simple 
form which children should know and are able to comprehend. ‘ 
Another cause of partial failure in the teaching of this subject is the tendency of 
teachers to crowd too many problems, embracing a large number of principles, into one 
lesson, An examination should include problems containing all principles the pupils 
have been taught; but one principle is usually sufficient for the daily lesson. Teachers 
should bear in mind that it is a good quality rather than a large amount of work that 
is tobe desired, and that it is better to have one principle thoroughly understood by all 
members of the class than many principles imperfectly comprehended. Our successful 
teachers of arithmetic insist that a diagram shall be drawn by every pupil to illustrate 
each problem before a solution of itis attempted. When all teachers insist upon this 
in each case, according to the instructions they have received, they will findit a great 
help to their classes in gaining arithmetical knowledge. 
Much has been said in a general way against the forcing process here illustrated, 
but it is not likely to be prevented until the observation and statements of particular 
instances haye brought about a clear understanding of the nature of the evil. 
Grading,—Grading is a feature of our city schools that excites more or less criti- 
cism, yet it is by no means peculiar to public elementary schools, On the contrary, the 
absence of grading (i. e,, distinct classification based upon standards of scholarships) 
is noticeable where funds are meagre and there is a general want of the requisites for 
an efficient educational work. Grading is an evil only when it is treated as an end 
in itself, a tendency which has not been sufficiently controlled in the past. The 
subject has been very thoroughly discussed in recent conferences of teachers and 
supervising officers, with results that promise a better regulation of grading in tho 
future. ‘ 
The plan of dividing each grade into two classes pursuing the same studies but 
reciting alternately has been tried with good results, This arrangement gives every 
child a chance to work by himself and in school, insures greater diligence on the 
part of the child in school hours, and decreases the hours of mental effort by requir- 
ing less time to be spent in protracted recitations, whereby the number of hours of 
home study is virtually diminished. 
With reference to the principle of classification to be observed in this arrangement, 
Hon. A. P. Marble, superintendent of public schools, Worcester, Mass., makes the fol- 
Jowing recommendations: 
(1) In the first place do not put the boys in one class and the girls in another. 
(2) It will be harmful to sort out the nervous, brilliant reciters of lessons for one 
elass and the slow and dull for the other. The nervous, high strung, ambitious boys 
and girls are not the ones to be pushed forward in advance, It is better in many 
cases for them to go along moderately, and to fill up the spare time by broadening 
the range of what they learn, than to push them forward or allow them to rush for- 
ward too rapidly in the school curriculum. This broadening may be done by directing 
their reading and turning their attention to what goes on around them, in the shops, 
on the street, and in the business which they may happen to know about. Instead 
of adding to the set and formal lessons of this class of pupils, they may be allowed 
to set down in writing what they know of any subject or any process of manufact- 
ure. They thus get ease of expression and a definiteness of thought which less 
ractice does not give the other pupils. The interest of this class of pupils in tho 
lessons which it takes only a small part of their time to master may be kept. up by 
incidental attention to correlative subjects, It isnot always best to hurry a bright and 
active pupil into the next grade, So much by way of suggestion as to these smart 
pupils, . 
(3) Again, in each of the rooms, there is a class tolerably well graded; they are 
never exactly graded; if they are subdivided, the classes will not long remain exactl; 
graded. It is not necessary and not desirable that they should be kept exactly etd 
Now, by dividing the room into two classes, the matter stands about where it did be- 
fore—no more difficulty, no less. If it happens that the two classes keep on, neck

and neck, no matter. If it turns out that one class gets along faster than the other, 
no harm in that. But the bright division, if there be one, should not absorb the teach- 
er’s time; and pupils are not to be put from one to the other as a reward of merit or 
a punishment. In either case, the two divisions will go on together to the next room 
just the same as if there were but one class. s 
The experiment has been found to work well. It should be observed that this 
practice of double divisions in the same grade has always been maintained in certain 
cities. 
From the usual organization of the systems of city schools the duty of instruct- 
ing and disciplining the scholars of the grammar grade falls largely upon women. 
There are serious objections to the exclusion of men from a due share of this work, 
much of which seems to require the strength, force, and endurance characteristic of 
the sterner sex. In a number of cities measures are proposed for bringing the gram- 
mar schools more directly or more largely under the influence of male teachers. 
With examinations subordinated to instruction, grading made properly flexible, 
and the teaching force judiciously constituted, the grammar schools will be in con- 
dition to realize the hopes of those who have labored so earnestly for their improve- 
ment in recent years. Already the good results of changes that have been introduced 
within a few years are apparent. The quantity of arithmetic and technical grammar 
required has been considerably diminished, while better methods of teaching com- 
pntation and language have effected a freer exercise of the reasoning powers and a 
more correct use of language on the part of pupils. Drawing has been very generally 
introduced in the grammar grades, and much attention has been given to the develop- 
ment of taste and sensibility. Among the exercises that particularly conduce to 
this end must be mentioned those of authors’ day and arbor day. Although’ these 
exercises are not confined to the grammar schools it is here that their influence is most 
positive and beneficial, 
The feature of the work in our city schools just referred to is noticed particularly 
by the foreigners who from time to time visit this country to study our institutions. 
The following statement is from a report submitted to the minister of public instruc- 
tion, France, by Mademoiselle Marie Loizillon,’ Referring particularly to impressions 
derived from her inspection of the schools of Cincinnati, she says: 
It appears that instruction is considered almost everywhere as a means towards an 
end; that is, education pure and simple is the goal to be attained. On all sides the 
aim of teaching is to elevate the mind and to improve the moral tone. Therefore 
reading and literature enter largely into the course of study. Pupils of all grades 
participate in such work according to their ability ; in the higher classes they famil- 
jarize themselves with the most celebrated authors, quoting readily from their best 
known works and often reciting the master pieces of English and American poets. 
Many times the pone write whole poems or essays on the blackboard. They are 
never at a loss. Should poetry from Longfellow, Bryant, or Shakespeare be called 
for at any time it would be given, so great and so highly cultivated is the taste of the 
American child for literature. 
Superintendent Peuslee lately inaugurated in the schools so-called anniversary days 
of great men, such as prominent citizens, statesmen, poets, artists, &c. These “days” 
take place quite often and are veritable tournaments. The pupils prepare themselves 
carefully beforehand, and, in their readings or recitations on the subject taken from 
the life of the celebrity selected, without making any pretensions, they ofttimes show 
considerable talent. These féte days are almost Tike family festivals, and the authori- 
ties present add much to the success of the day by their well timed marks of appro- 
bation and encouragement. 
  
1Tn the fall of 1882 Mile. M. Loizillon, inspectrice générale des écoles maternelles, and Mile. M. Coutn- 
rier, Paris, directrice de l'Ecole professionnelle du Havre, visited this country to study education. 
‘Phe fact thai the two ladies, commissioned by the French minister of public instruction, came by 
themselves was interesting to American edueators in itself. The eminent ability and character of the 
ladies and the great work they had already accomplished in education gave a special value to any 
opinions they might form. ‘They expressed themselves in many ways appreciative and grateful for 
the courtesies extended them by our teachers and school officers. After their return a very cordial 
note of thanks was communicated to this Office by a representative of the French ministry, express- 
ing in carnest terms appreciation of the courtesies and opportunities extended to these ladies in their 
visits among our schools.

Evening schools.—The extent of the provision made in evening schools for scholars 
who have not the chance to profit by the day schools will be seen by reference to 
Table II, appendix. It is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to record the final 
triumph of the Evening High School, Boston. After uncertainty and protracted dis- 
cussion, the school was reopened January 3, 1882, under satisfactory conditions. 
Finances.—F rom the financial summary, Table II, it appears that the total receipts 
for education in 1882 were $30,181,675, four cities not reporting; total expenditure, 
four cities not reporting, $27,894,427. The receipts do not represent the whole amount 
raised in the cities for the support of public education, as many cities contribute 
much more to the State school tax of their respective States than they receive from 
that source. 
School system of Washington, D. C.—I am indebted to Hon. J. O. Wilson, super- 
intendent of schools, Washington, D.C., for the following outline of the organization 
and conduct of the schools under his supervision. It is a brief but precise exposi- 
tion of one of the most carefully planned and efficient systems maintained in our 
country : 
The public school system includes the elementary schools, the high school, and the 
normal school. The courses of study are arranged as follows: The course for the ele- 
mentary schools is divided into eight grades, and, beginning with the lowest and 
proceeding to the highest, they are designated by the terms first grade, second grade, 
and so on to the eighth grade. A year is required for doing the work of each grade, 
from the first to the seventh inclusive, and two years are allowed for the work of the 
eighth grade. Some of the stronger and more capable pupils do the work of the 
eighth grade in one year. As one-half or more of the pupils who enter the eighth 
grade leave the schools on completing its course, it is thought best to make the 
treatment of the studies as thorough and broad as possible, and two years are allowed 
for this purpose." Arithmeticis thoroughly completed, so that it need not be reviewed 
by those who pass on to the high school; the elements of algebra are studied ; geography 
and the history and Constitution of the United States are reviewed and studied with 
a higher and more scientific treatment ; English grammar, including abundant practice 
in writing, business and social forms, reproductions, transpositions, compositions, and 
essays, receives much attention. A few of the standard works of the best English 
authors are critically read and studied. 
Promotions from grade to grade are ordinarily made only at the beginning of the 
school year. They are made at other times whenever the best interests of a pupil 
justify or require it. The exceptions to the rule have not been numerous or trouble- 
some. Under a system of yearly promotions, while the course of study for each pupil 
is the same in length it need not be so in breadth, and there are very obvious and 
weighty reasons for not making the several periods of tuition in a graded course of 
ade (each requiring a change of teacher) so short that the teacher has time to learn 
put little about the pupils individually. 
Written examinations are held in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, usu- 
ally designated grammar schools, as follows: In the fifth and sixth grades monthly 
and in the seventh and eighth grades bimonthly, commencing with October and 
ending with May. 
In most schoo?s the examinations are divided and distributed over the period of 
study included, so that only one study is taken up at each examination. This part of 
the school work, unattractive alike to teachers and pupils, is thus distributed through 
the year-as equably as possible. Each teacher prepares his or ber own questions, su- 
pervises the work, examines the papers, and marks and records the results, There is 
no attempt to make these examinations uniform in all the schools, By means of areci- 
tation card, devised for the purpose, a note is made of the daily recitations. From 
these two sources combined a yearly record of the scholarship of each pupil is made. 
An annual written examination covering all the work of the year is held just before 
the close of the schools in June. In this examination the questions are prepared by 
the school officers, and no teacher has charge of the work in his or her own school, 
Promotion from grade to grade below the high school is not based upon any speci- 
fied percentage attained by the pupils. It is left to the best judgment of the teacher 
who has instructed them in the grade from which they are to be promoted, and who 
has, as aids to a correct decision, the record made through the year, the record of the 
annual examination, and a personal knowledge of the pupils. 
At the close of the year each teacher makes out, on a prescribed form, a list of the 
pupils who have satisfactorily completed the work of the grade, certifies the same 
over his or her signature, and the promotions are made accordingly. This plan of 
making promotions gives general satisfaction. Mistakes are made but seldom, and 
then are easily corrected.

    ‘LXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION.® 
During the past few years there has been no change in the list of studies pursued 
in the elementary grades, but the methods of teavhing these studies have been con- 
stantly changing for the better. They are much more objective now than formerly. 
oulding, map drawing, pictures, and specimens of productions and manufacttites are 
all brought into use in teaching geography, and in fact they are considered indispen- 
sable to effective teaching. The simple elementary facts of natural science are taught 
with the aid of visible illustration: botany is taught from plants, zodlogy from ani- 
mals, mineralogy from minerals. Physiology and hygiene cannot be illustrated so 
readily, but a fair degree of success has attended the efforts in this direction. More 
than one hundred pieces of apparatus, simple and inexpensive, have been devised and 
made by teachers and pupils for experiments in physics. Drawing is a regular study 
in all the grades, and no study is more popular with teachers and pupils. It gives a 
training of hand and eye that is of great general value to all and of special practical 
vane e many who engage in occupations requiring knowledge and skill in this 
subject.

  XOVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
Table III presents a summary of the provision for training teachers in public nor- 
mal schools, private normal schools, and departments of other schools, colleges, and 
universities. The total number of public institutions reported is 119, with 1,045 in- 
structors and 28,711 students, viz, 21,296 normal students and 7,415 other students. 
These schools comprise 97 supported by State, 1 by county, and 21 by city appropria- 
tion. The private normal schools number 114, with 655 instructors and 22,421 stu- 
dents; of these 15,043 are reported as normal and 7,049 as other students, the classi- 
fication of 329 not being specified. The number of graduates from public normal 
schools in the last year was 2,568, and the number who have engaged in teaching, 
1,836; the corresponding numbers for the private normal schools are 1,034 and 708, 
‘The appropriations for normal schools, exclusive of the sums for buildings, sites, 
&c., are a trifle in excess of the same for 1881, including appropriations for building; 
the amount reported in 1882 is about $60,000 in excess of that reported in 1881. The 
six States making the largest appropriations are New York, $138,256; Virginia, $112,049 
(including $100,000 appropriated by the legislature for site and buildings for the Vir- 
ginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, for colored students, at Petersburg); Massa- 
chusettsy $85,899 (exclusive of appropriations for the Boston Normal School); Penn- 
sylvania, $79,054 ; California, $62,000; and Ilinois, $61,264. 
The increase of normal schools in the Southern and Western States is a noteworthy 
feature of progress. 
Delaware, Geergia, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Nevada make no public proyi- 
sion for normal svh¥ols and Ohio has no State normal schools. Oregon appears for 
the first time in the table of States reporting public normal schools, the legislature 
of 1882 having passed an act providing for the establishment of two State normal 
schools. 
Since December, 1882, the Peabody Normal Seminary, New Orleans, La., has been 
continued as a private institution, the educational authorities having failed to make 
provision for either of the normal schools in New Orleans. 
In the discussion of the general subject of the training of teachers three important 
questions-arise: (1) What method of training will best fit young people for the work 
of primary instruction so largely intrusted to them? (2) Shall the professional 
training in normal schools be distinct from the academic or shall both be carried on 
together ? (3) What means shall be employed to inculcate a true educational phi- 
losophy? 
These are matters to be determined by experiment, for which reason I have given 
much space in previous reports to detailed statements of the courses of study and 
methods of procedure characteristic of the leading normal schools, and to the re- 
sults of their work as displayed in the progress of elementary schools under thé con- 
duct of their graduates. In the endeavor to draw practical suggestions from the ex- 
ample of these institutions we are further assisted by noting, from time to time, the 
impression that they make upon the minds of experienced and impartial observers 
from abroad, who have no other object in view in their examinations than to accu- 
mulate information for the ultimate advantage of their own institutions. 
A report of unusual interest, in this respect, is that made by Dr. McLellan, in- 
spector of high schools in Ontario, who, in the fall of 1881, was deputed to examine 
into our normal schools and certain other features of our system of public educa- 
tion, for the purpose of comparing the same with corresponding departments in the 
province. The whole of his report is well worth the attention of all interested in 
these subjects ; space will only permit me to make a few extracts embodying his 
observations upon certain of our normal schools: 
With reference to the city normal school, Boston, Mass., which Dr, McLellan styles 
“a really professional school,” he observes: 
The limits of the powers of children, the physical condition of effective mental 
action, and the conditions of growth and health, the necessity for rest, air, sleep, and 
the means of securing these, the means of guarding children against draughts of cold
-P-A-G-E-97
  
NORMAL INSTRUCTION. XCVIL 
air, against excessive heat, &c., all these and many other details are considered and 
discussed for a special purpose, giving to the student a special knowledge acquired 
for application to a particular calling. It is justly assumed that physical education is 
of paramount importance—that the corpus sanum is a necessary condition of the mens 
sana. 
Dr. McLellan dwells particularly upon the observation and practice exercises ac-' 
complished in the training school connected with the Boston Normal School, which 
were described quite fully in my report for 1880. 
With reference to the State Normal School, Albany, N. Y., after stating the admis- 
sion requirements, he says: 
It may thus be seen that the literary attainments required for graduation are quite 
extensive, perhaps too extensive if thoroughness be takeninto account. The students, 
however, receive a thorough drill in all the subjects of the public school course, while 
they are instructed in the branches as carefully as time permits. Itis justly assumed 
that the minimum course for the public school pupil should not determine the maxi- 
mum course for the public school teacher. : 
The appliances for teaching science are very good and methods of instruction are 
excellent. 
(1) Professional training.—The professional training, it will be noticed, isnot dis- 
tinct from the academic (or “ general”); they are carried on simultaneously. Dr. 
Alden is of vpinion that, under present circumstances in that State, the two courses 
must go on together. Teachers (candidates for the teaching profession) must acquire 
correct habits of thinking, must learn how to think and how to acquire knowledge 
with the best results in discipline. If the modes of instruction in academic work 
have not been such as to secure this in the student he will inevitably follow rae 
methods of instruction when he himself becomes a teacher. The force of habit wil 
prove too strong for him, and he will teach as he has been taught, not as he has been 
told how to teach. Under the vicious influence of bad teaching in the public school, 
strengthened by bad teaching in the high school, the student becomes, as it were, 
saturated with wrong methods. These will be followed in spite of a theoretical lect- 
uring in a brief normal school course on different and better methods. 
(2) In the teaching of all the professors the ultimate calling of the students is kept 
in view. They teach subjects not merely to impart literary and scientific facts and 
principles, but so as to give them the highest educational value and leave upon the 
mind the impress of the best educational methods. In their own methods they reveal 
and illustrate the true methods which, in all essentials, the students are afterwards 
to observe in the work of the school room. Students become habituated to the true 
path by being constantly kept in the true path under the guidance of those whe are 
familiar with it; they learn to think correctly by being constantly taught to think 
correctly ; they learn how to acquire knowledge in the best way by being constantly 
trained in the best methods of acquisition; they learn the value of subjects as instru- 
ments of discipline, as well as the best methods of making them efficient instruments, 
because they are perpetually under the influence of methods designed to secure disci- 
pline and the development of power. Each professor, too, keeps in view any modifi- 
cations of his method which might be necessary in dealing with children. In a word, 
each professor is expected to be himself a true teacher, by precept it is true, but es- 
pecially by example. And thus philosophical instruction, not so much formal as ma- 
terial, is given at every recitation in every branch. 
(3) A course of instruction in mental philosophy and its application in education is 
iven by Dr. Alden. There is no attempt at metaphysics, nor time wasted in fruit- 
less discussions of unsettled problems of philosophy. But a simple course is fol- 
lowed —a course having special and practical reference to the teacher’s work. Dr. 
Alden pursues—and trains his students to pursue—the inductive method in the study 
of philosophy, approaching the study of mind as we do the study of nature, ob- 
serving particular facts in order to arrive at the general laws which regulate the men- 
tal activities. Having treated of the human mind in the usual threefold division of intellect, emotions, will, he proceeds to show the bearings of the knowledge thus ac- 
quired on the work of education. 
With reference to professional training in the State Normal School, Worcester, 
Mass., Dr. McLellan says: 
(1) Though the professional and the general training are carried on together here, 
Principal Russell is of opinion that the proper function of a normal school is to give professional training exclusively, or at all events chiefly. Ifthe schools with which it 
rests to give the required scholarship are really efficient — capable of giving a thorough 
general training —it would seem that there ought to be no difficulty in confining nor- 
E—VII ‘

  XCVIIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
mal schools to professional work. Efficiency on the part of such schools for general 
training is, however, essential. Sound knowledge must be given, and in a sound 
way; that is, the methods of instruction followed must be thoroughly rational. This 
means skilled and trained teachers in these schools. If this condition fail, a short 
course in a normal school will not correct the defects of general education. The nor- 
mal school course would have to be extended so that the general work imperfectly 
accomplished by these schools might be completed. In fact, if the work is badly 
done in these academic institutions, the work of the normal schools is made more dif- 
ficult than would be the entire education of the student. For not only would they 
have to give the necessary scholarship, they would also have to eradicate the bad hab- 
its of a previous training. 
In any case, the normal school course ought to cover sufficient time to enable the 
professors to supplement the previous training, to give a connected view of the vari- 
ous branches as departments of science, and to secure facility and power in specially 
important subjects, as science, drawing, and elocution. 
(2) Here, as in the Albany Normal Rakeah the faculty, in all their teaching, keep 
constantly in view the fact that they are teaching those who intend to become teach- 
ers. Every professor endeavors to be, not by occasional rene merely, but espe- 
cially by the example set in his own daily teaching, a teacher of didactics, Hence 
the students are trained in the direction of philosophic methods of education, inas- 
much as they are constantly subject to the influence of right methods of instruction 
and education. 
3) A course of instruction is given-by Professor Brown on psychology, with special 
reference to applications in education. 
In addition to this course in psychology, lessons are given by Principal Russell in 
the history of education and educational methods Sa in the practical and definite 
application of the principles of education. From what I saw of these courses and 
the practical, commonsense way in which they were given,I have not the slightest 
doubt that they are of great value in the training of the teacher. The Socratic 
method followed by the professors clearly revealed the intelligence of the students 
and the undoubted worth, in a professional point of view, of the educational psychol- 
ogy and history, which the skill of the instructors made constantly interesting and 
profitable. 
There is a special teacher of methods, a lady who appears to be thoroughly quali- 
fied for her task. This teacher of methods gives well digested lessons and practical 
illustrations of the best methods of teaching reading, writing, arithmetic—in fact 
every branch which the student will afterwards be called upon to teach. 
In the general summary of his observations, Dr. McLellan, having enumerated the 
conditions which to his mind make it seem desirable to separate the academic and 
professional courses, says: 
Under these conditions I have no doubt that the plan of separating the academic 
from the professional course can be made entirely successful. The Boston Normal 
School affords a satisfactory example of this. Some of the best teaching I had the 
ae of witnessing during my visit, I might say some of the best I ever saw, was 
lone by graduates of this school. They had been subject to a long course of training 
in the city public schools; this had been followed by a full course of four years in the 
high schools, and this again by one year’s sound professional training under earnest 
and capable teachers. The results were eminently good. Nature, indeed, had con- 
tributed something to these results, for nascitur, non fit, which is so often applied to 
the true poet, may, at least in a measure, be affirmed of the true teacher. Here was 
natural aptitude trained to high perfection. The teacher had learned to play on the 
“harp by playing on the harp,” but evidently every touch of her finger had been di- 
rected by one who was skilled on the instrument. 
In the lowest primary grade I saw lessons given in reading, number, color, form, 
measure (the metric system), and all were given with the educative power of the true 
teacher. The fundamental maxims of education, from the concrete to the abstract, 
from the known to the unknown, from the idea to the word, from the thought to the 
expression, &c., which are often glibly repeated and as often mere dead vocables with- 
out a living influence, had entered thoroughly into the teacher’s conception of her 
work and spontaneously governed every act and element in her teaching. She did 
not “communicate” knowledge; she helped her pupils to acquire nomena She 
never did for the pupils what they could do for themselves: the development of their 
self activity was her studied aim. She seemed to know exactly just what the pupils 
could do for themselves and what they could not do, and with admirable tact led the 
little ones to recognize in the unknown that was before them the familiar features of 
the known. She knew that self exercise on the part of her pupils was the necessary 
condition of the acquisition of knowledge and the development of power, and there-

The: Americans’ [observes:Dt: McLellan] are’ a progressive people; their inventive. 
genius: has become proverbial, but: they have:never been able to. discover a royal road, 
to learning, nor to invent a means:of annihilating: time as a necessary condition in 
producing culture. They have not in any State, I believe, devised’ a means of giving 
all the teachers of the public schools: a fair measure of" professional’ training, so that 
many teachers are to be found: with little scholarship and little skill in teaching, But 
the teachers: whom they do-educate and.train professionally, in general, do credit to 
their training and are worthy of their calling, And this is due to the fact above 
referred to: they consider that a long course of literary and proféssional' training’ is 
indispensable to the turning out of really'efficient teachers. Icannotnow enlarge upon 
this point, but I have no doubt of its importance: I observed everywhere: evidences 
of the good effects of a long, course:of training under able and enthusiastic teachers, 
The following extracts-are from the report of’ Mademoiselle Marie Loizillon to the 
Frenely minister of publie instruction, previously alluded: to.in these pages: 
The normals are splendidly housed, either im separate special ey as) at: 
Sti Lowis; or in edifices: containing’ schools-of different grades, asin Boston, Néw York, 
and Philadelphia. The furnishings are-very complete, many times even very luxuri- 
ous. Fine libraries, rich collections, &c., aid greatly in both theoretical and practical 
instruction. * * ” * *” * * 
All the more noticeable characteristics: of the public. schools—such. as order, disei- 
pline, fine: bearing, activity, ambition, and enthusiasm — are found in. the highest 
degreein the normals. The regular onward march towards progress in the instruction 
in pedagogy is particularly interesting. 
The practice or model schools deserve special attention. The: pupil teachers work 
under the watchful ore of instructresses who make-notes of their general bearing, of 
the language used, the clearness of the explanations, the tone employed, the voice, 
manner of asking questions, use of blackboard, discipline, &e. % * * * 
Notwithstanding this flourishing condition of things matters do not.remain dormant. 
Each year suggestions are made by the principals of the different schools in regard 
to points of improvement, and sucht improvements are generally carried out. * * 
Tn order’ not to multiply details, it is:sufficient.to say that the end and aim of the 
boards of education and ‘principals is to study the needs of these schools, to correct 
abuses, to increase the powers of the teaching force, and to thus assure increasing 
prosperity to the public schools, 
Dr. MeLellan’s observations, it will be seen, were confined to the States, bordering 
upon the provinees. Those familiar with the whole country are aware that equally 
favorable impressions might be formed from an examination of the normal schools in 
the interior, the far West, and even the Southern States, in which, although the school 
systems are of recent growth, the training of teachers has received much attention. 
The position of Washington, upon the border line of the South, naturally causes 
southern school officers to look to that city for example and suggestion in their en- 
deavors to develop the public schools of their own cities. Like the Boston Normal 
School, the Washington Normal School is strictly professional. Superintendent J. 0. 
Wilson furnishes the following account of the system of training pursued: 
The normal school takes a limited number (at present twenty-five) of graduates from 
the high school and gives them a one year’s eourse of professional training, the study 
of the theory and the practice of the art of teaching. The candidates admitted are 
selected by competitive examination, which secures to the school a high stand- 
ard of academic scholarship asa starting point for each class. The normal school has 
practice schools of the first and second grade, under the exclusive control of the prin- 
cipal ef the school. The téachers of the practice schools rank as assistants in the 
normal school. Schools of the higher grades are also made use of for observation and 
practice. The fundamental principles of education can be studied best in connection 
with theit application in teaching young children. Hence the greater part of the 
practice is in the lower grade schools especially assigned for this purpose, 
While certain of our normal schools are thus ably fulfilling the purposes for which 
they are established, it must be admitted that others fail of any special results as
-P-A-G-E-100
c REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
training schools, Some are embarrassed by the low and unequal attainments of their 
scholars; others, by the lack of efficient training teachers. Some are dragging along 
with the courses of study and practice that were adopted twenty years ago and some 
are hindered by the influence of selfish or narrow minded politicians, manifesting 
itself through legislation. To guard against such conditions it is necessary that the 
schools should be conducted in accordance with well defined requirements as to stand- 
ards of admission and graduation and courses of study and practice. They must main- 
tain the character of efficient and progressive institutions, or they will not justify the 
expense incurred in their behalf. This character, however, cannot be maintained 
under the depressing effects of meagre funds and adverse legislation. 
Teachers’ institutes. — Few graduates of normal schools teach in the small district 
scliools, as they readily command more lucrative and permanent positions elsewhere. 
Under existing circumstances, teachers’ institutes and summer normals are indispensa- 
ble as a means of imparting to the great body of rural teachers some knowledge of ap- 
proved methods of instruction and of school organization. Each year affords new 
evidence of the importance of these agencies, and the superintendents and other officers 
who are Fesponsible for their conduct use every endeavor to increase their efficiency 
and extend their influence. ‘The expense of these institutes and summer normals is 
comparatively small, and it is desirable that action should be taken in every State to 
place them upon a sure financial basis. It would be well if attendance upon these 
training classes should be made one of the requisites for obtaining a teacher’s license 
in the case of candidates who have had no other preparation for the work of teaching. 
Particular accounts of the institutes held during the year will be found under the 
heading Training of Teachers in the abstracts. 
‘The instruction of common school teachers was made a part of the work of the 
regents of the University of New York as early as 1834, when the legislature passed 
an act authorizing the regents to distribute to such academies as they might select a 
portion of the surplus income of the literature fund, estimated at $3,000 per annum, 
to be expended in educating teachers of common schools in such manner and under 
such regulations as the regents should prescribe. Up to 1881 the fitness of candidates 
for membership in teachers’ classes had been determined by an examination, usually 
informal, made by the principal of the school. At this time the standard for admis- 
sion to the classes was made a regents’ preliminary certificate, where it now remains. 
The necessity for more careful and personal supervision of the teachers’ classes had 
long been felt. The classes under instruction during the fall and winter terms of 
1881-’82 were accordingly visited by special inspectors employed by the regents. The 
results of these visitations plainly indicated the value of such personal inspection 
and examination of the classes. By legislative enactment of June, 1882, the regents 
were authorized to make permanent provision for the due supervision and inspection 
of these classes, in accordance with which enactment the appointment of the present 
inspector was made, and he entered upon his duties in July, 1882. By the provisions 
of the same act these classes were placed under the official visitation of the school 
commissioners in their respective districts, who are to assist in the organization and 
management of the classes and in their final examination, and to make to the 
regents of the university a report in regard to the instruction of the classes and 
the qualifications of their members. Each scholar instructed in a teachers’ class 
who holds a regents’ preliminary certificate and who passes the final examination of 
the class thereby becomes entitled to the regents’ testimonial, which, when indorsed 
by any school commissioner, becomes a valid license to teach in the schools of his dis- 
trict for one year from the date of the indorsement, and the testimonial may receive 
subsequent indorsements at the discretion of the commissioner. 
Some difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the standard for admission to 
the classes, i. e., the regents’ preliminary certificate, on account of the fact that many 
school commissioners persist in licensing the cheapest teachers they can procure or in *
-P-A-G-E-101

cusing the license as a means of favoring relatives, political supporters, &c. ; never- 
theless the regents’ action is a step in the right direction, and if persisted in, as it 
undoubtedly will be, may assist materially in putting an end to the abuse of the license 
power. 
The following interesting particulars with reference to the teaching force of the 
State are derived from the returns of commissioners to the regents’ inquiries. The 
commissioners’ reports from 26 schools show that the total number of licensed 
teachers in their districts is 2,653, of whom 1,833 had attended academies and 861 
had been members of teachers’ classes. In reports from 32 schools, the total num- 
ber of licensed teachers is 3,435, of whom 2,318 had attended academies. From 
this the fact appears that in the commissioner district from which these reports are 
received, 60 per cent. of all licensed teachers have been instructed in the academies 
or high schools and 32 per cent. have received the benefit of instruction in teachers’ 
classes. The commissioners have shown a very earnest codperation in the efforts 
made to benefit the common schools through the instruction given in these classes, 
and freely express their appreciation of the work attempted by.the regents in ad- 
vancing the standard of admission and instruction. ‘ 
While the importance of all agencies for the training of teachers is recognized, it 
must be admitted that no training is so fruitful in results as that which is accom- 
plished in the normal schools, with a class of students who have made a satisfactory 
record in a well ordered course of instruction in the elementary and high schools. 
The multiplication of public normal schools, with a due provision for the appoint- 
ment of their graduates in the public schools, is the surest and in the long run will 
prove the most economical means of raising the standard of education throughout 
the country. 
Pedagogics in universities and colleges.— Chairs of pedagogies or didactics have been 
established in the Universities of Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska, and an 
effort is being made to establish the same in the Mississippi State University and 
in the Agricultural and Meehanical College of that State. Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity maintained, during 1882, special Saturday classes for the benefit of teachers of 
Baltimore.. The public lectures given under the auspices of the university have 
also been largely attended by teachers, They included a course in psychology by 
G. Stanley Hall, pu. D., university lecturer on pedagogics, Harvard University. Itis 
probable that Dr. Hall will accept a permanent appointment as lecturer upon psy- 
chology in Johns Hopkins. The following announcement appears in the prospectus 
of the Lawrence Scientific School, Harvard University: 
The school offers facilities to teachers, and to persons preparing to be teachers, who 
desire to qualify themselves in the modern methods of teaching science by observa- 
tion and experiment. A one year’s course of study, adapted to this purpose, may be 
selected from the elements of natural history, chemistry, and physics, including any 
of the following subjects: Physical geography and elementary geology, general chem- 
istry and qualitative ‘analysis, mineralogy, physics, botany, comparative anatomy 
and physiology, zodlogy. 
This course is flexible and comprehensive; the instruction is mainly given in the 
laboratories and museums of the university, and is of the most practical character, 
every student being taught to make experiments and study specimens. 
Dr. Barnard, president of Columbia College, again, in his report for 1882, urges 
upon the trustees the importance of establishing a department ‘‘ to train young men 
to education as a profession.” 
Provision in other countries for training teachers.—- The provision made in other coun- 
tries, especially English speaking countries, for training teachers should not escape 
our attention. 
The public school system of Ontario includes an effective plan for testing the lit- 
erary and scientific attainments of all candidates for the teacher’s profession. 
In Great Britain the training of teachers is a subject that engages the interest of 
many impogtant bodies. In addition to the inspected training colléges reported in

  foreign summary, the Office has information.of provision for training or examin- 
ng teachers.as follows: In 1830 Cambridge University inaugurated examinations 
in Pedagogy for teachers.of secondary schools. Lhe university has also founded a 
chair of pedagogy. The University of London has instituted a teacher’s diploma, 
the first examination for which avas held in March, 1893. Practical teaching is an 
integr: al pant of the examination, which jsopen only to graduates. 
The College of Preceptors, Louden, maintains a training class for teachers and an 
examination of teachers for the.college diploma. In 1883 150 candidates entered for 
this examination. ' 
The Skinner Street College, Bishopsgate, London, was established for the especial 
purpose of training women for the position of teachers in secondary schools. Candi- 
dates for admission must be atleast seventeen years of age amd must pass.an entrance 
tion. The students are divided into two classes: the first includes those who 
for one year; the second, these who.enter for two years, The courses are pur- 
sned with a view to the examinations in pedagogy of Cambridge University, Lon- 
don University, University of St. Andrews, and the College of Preceptors, in all of 
which examinations the students of this college have gained great distinction. The 
council of the college has also instituted a diploma, which is only obtained by a severe 
examination, to which no student under twenty years.of age is admitted. The col- 
lege fee is 251. per annum. Forty scholars entered for the session of 1882. That the 
college meets a recognized want is shown by the demand for its graduates to fill re- 
sible positions ia secondary schools. 
The University of St. Andrews includes pedagogy in the subjects of examination 
for the degree of L. L. A. (literate in arts). Edinburgh and St. Andrews Universities 
have both founded chairs of pedagogy. 
The best method of preparing teachers to give instruction in elementary seience is 
a subject of earnest consideration by leading teachers and scientific men in England. 
On account of the system of examinations and grants administered by the science 
and art department elementary teachers find themselves directly interested in the 
matter, A union of teachers of science and arts was effected in June, 1883, whose 
objects are, first, the advancement of the profession; second, the redress of griev- 
ances. The presidency of the association for one year was accepted by Professor 
Huxley.

CIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
It must be confessed that, up to the present time, one among us who seeks a com- 
plete business education must, as a rule, go outside of tlie courses of study established 
by the public schools or the endowed institutions for secondary and superior instruc- 
tion. This want has been met up to the present mainly by certain able and cultured 
teachers who have seen the great public demand and come forward and out of their 
own means and energies furnished the required instruction. Instead of disparage- 
ment from those engaged in other departments of education, they should have sym- 
pathy and support in all these meritorious efforts. An increasing consciousness of 
the imperative necessity for this training and.of its value to the young is manifested 
among school authorities. Arithmetics have an increasing amount of business forms 
and text books on book-keeping are frequently studied. 
It is not amiss to notice here two objections raised against these efforts with con- 
siderable force. One is that the character of the instruction by the teacher or text 
book is so unlike anything in practical affairs that it is worse than useless. The pupil 
that has thus been taught banking or exchange or business forms, it is affirmed, when 
he takes his place in a mercantile house, has to free himself from what he has thus 
acquired and learn the methods in practical use. 
The other objection, which pertains more exclusively to business education, is that 
urged by a class of business men who despise learning. They ure ignorant; they 
treat all questions in a selfish or narrow or ignorant light. ‘They would not have a 
boy instructed ; in their language, ‘‘the school would spoil him,” teachers are fools; 
and they do all in their power to keep mercantile affairs in the hands of those like 
themselves and to make the pursuit distasteful and offensive to the youth of noble 
aspirations. 
These objections will not stand investigation, however available they may be for the 
purpose of the opponents of a sound and thorough preparation for business and of 
those who would keep this instruction out of the hands of teachers and out of schools. 
The more this instruction is made fit the more its rightness and expediency will be 
seen, the greater the number of youths who will resort to it, and the faster will it 
elevate and ennoble the vocation. 
On the continent of Europe various forms of special instruction have been carried 
further thah with us. Schools for business may be found aided by the public funds. 
Their appliances are sometimes elaborate and expensive. The course of study at the 
commercial school of Antwerp is worthy of note. It embraces two years, and the 
students are eighteen or twenty years old. They are thoroughly trained in the mer- 
cantile offices connected with the school. The program embraces transactions of a 
general business honse, commercial arithmetic, invoices, accounts of sales, accounts 
current, commercial calculations and valuations, exchange operations, public funds, 
book-keeping, bills of lading, foreign and international commercial law, general his- 
tory of commerce and industry, commercial and maritime legislation compared, cus 
toms legislation, the tariff schemes of different nations, ship building and fitting out, 
commercial and industrial geography, political economy and statistics, and corre- 
spondence in foreign languages, the pupil receiving instruction in French, Dutch, 
German, Spanish, Italian, and English, and being required to examine and draw 
inferences from newspapers published in nearly all the business centres of the world. 
The education of business men is especially demanded in this country. All the 
powers and attainments and manhood of the American merchant are laid under con- 
tribution in every direction. The tide of affairs rushes around him; everything is at 
high pressure; his walk, his manner, are infected by it. Who shall say that he of 
all men does not need a high and far-reaching purpose, all possible preparation, a 
clear calculation of the perils along his course, sure and ready command of himself 
and his forces, power to go and stop at will, habits of rest as well as labor, time fora 
happy home and a place for recreation—that his youth may be renewed and pro- 
longed—and wisdom, that he may administer on his own estate?

aInciudes some pupils receiving primary instruction. i 
The statistics of Kindergiirten show a noticeable growth the past year. The in- 
crease is due both to the establishment of Kindergiirten in States which did not 
report any for the previous year and to the multiplication of them in large cities. 
Kindergiirten existing in Nevada and New Hampshire in 1881 have disappeared and 
others have been established in Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Oregon, States 
which were not credited with any in my last report. A Kindergarten has also been 
established in New Mexico. The principal growth has been in the very largest of our 
cities, in which the Kindergarten methods are most demanded. More than one-half of 
these enterprises have started in the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Wash- 
ington, Chicago, and San Francisco. They are supported by the wealthy for the sake 
of their own children and by the philanthropic for the benefit of the poor by whom 
they are surrounded. 
The charity work of the Kindergarten is one of its most pleasing and attractive 
features. Its beneficent influences and instructions are carried into the poorest and 
most forbidding sections of our large cities, and seeds are sown in fresh soil that show 
immediate growth and promise future harvests. Associations are organized for ex- 
tending and supporting this work. Among them are the Public Kindergarten Society, 
the Jackson Street Kindergarten Association, and the New Silver Street Kindergarten 
Society, in San Francisco; the Free Kindergarten Association and the Frébel Kinder-

garten Association, in Chicago; the Kindergarten Association in Cincinnati, and the 
Sub-Primary School Society in Philadelphia. Their purposes may be illustrated by 
words used in the report of the Chicago Frébel Kindergarten Association, as follows: 
This eharity is designed by the association for the benefit of little children too young 
to be admitted to the public schools, who in winter are often locked into their comfort- 
less homes while their mothers are out at work and in summer are locked out of them, 
exposed to all the corrupting influences of the streets and alleys. 
The Chicago Free Kindergarten Association has for its object the maintenance of a 
class for training teachers and the promotion of free Kindergiirten in the city. The 
society sprang up as a remote consequence of the terms on which a lady, Miss Matilda 
H. Ross, accepted the invitation to become the principal of a new Kindergarten de- 
partment in the Cook County Normal School, namely, that she might associate with 
her duties at the normal school the organizing of free Kindergiirten for neglected 
children in Chicago. Her work became widely known through efforts to have its 
headquarters removed into the city, and an association for the establishment of a free 
training school and of free Kindergiirten resulted. The first Kindergarten was organ- 
ized July 5, 1881. Nine others have been opened by the association, and the number 
is increasing. The average daily attendance of children is about 600. 
The Cincinnati Kindergarten Association has three Kindergiirten in successful op- 
eration and nearly 200 children in attendance. The first one was opened in March, 
1880. f 
In Boston there are 24 free Kindergiirten, supported by Mrs. Q. A. Shaw, and super- 
intended by Miss L. B. Pingree. The comlition of these charities in 1882 was given 
by Miss Pingree as follows : ’ 
There are at present 31 free Kindergiirten for poor children in and near Boston, car- 
ried on by the private charity of one lady. Four of these Kindergiirten began their 
work in 1877; during 1878 and 1879, 14 others were started, and in 1880 the remain- 
ing 13. Twenty-three of these Kindergiirten receive 50 children, each under the 
charge of two trained teachers, a principal and an assistant; and 8 receive 25 
children, with one teacher in charge. Nineteen of these occupy school rooms or halls 
the use and care of which are kindly given by the city or town where they are placed; 
the remainder are in houses where day nursery work is also carried on, or in suitable 
rooms hired for the purpose. * * * No Kindergartner is engaged until she re~ 
ceives a diploma from a competent trainer, and great care is taken to engage only 
those who seem to have special fitness and ability for the public work among poor 
children. 
In Philadelphia the Sub-Primary School Society has undertaken a movement on 
behalf of ngglected children under school age and for the prevention of crime and 
pauperism. With these objects in view 17 free Kindergiirten have been estab- 
lished, in which care is taken of about 500 children. Other schools are to be pro- 
vided as soon as funds will permit. The society has codperated with the charity 
organizations of several of the wards. An offer of one-third of the teacher’s salary 
and an outfit for the Kindergarten made to any ward association which would estab- 
lish a free Kindergarten has been accepted in numerous instances. In San Francisco 
the three Kindergarten societies already mentioned have carried forward their char- 
itable work with energy and success. Seventeen free Kindergiirten have been estab- 
lished and 11 report an attendance of 624 children. These little ones come from 
mothers of all nationalities and religions, from homes of the most varied character, 
and from surroundings of poverty, woe, and crime; and all that can be is done to 
promote their moral, physical, and intellectual growth. In the report of the Jackson 
Street Free Kindergarten Association, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper says: 
The work of a teacher in these free Kindergirten is a distinctive work; it does not 
end with school hours. The children are so young and the home life is often so 
wretched as to require the best energies of the faithful teacher when the work of the 
school room is over. There is much visitation to be done to look up absent children; * 
and, where sickness invades, the teacher is often called upon to supply medical aid 
and other necessary help; and where death comes there is sometimes no one but the 
Kindergarten helpers to see the little one decently buried.

KINDERGARTEN AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. cVII 
The influence of these free Kindergiirten upon both children and parents is every- 
where acknowledged to be excellent. The report of the women’s corps of visitors of 
the twenty-ninth ward in Philadelphia says: 
- There is a noticeable improvement in the children in a shorttime. At first they are 
somewhat uneasy, and perhaps a little afraid, at their novel surroundings; but, find- 
ing themselves so kindly cared for and their welfare so evidently sought, they soon 
brighten into natural and happy children, showing by their intelligent readiness to 
adapt themselves to their new conditions how hopeful is work for the children. A 
ere effort is made by the mothers to send them as tidy as their circumstances 
permit. 
The following quotations from a published letter by Miss L. B. Pingree, superin- 
tendent of the Boston free Kindergiirten, are of interest in this connection: 
When these Kindergiirten began their work it was interesting to see the mixfure 
of curiosity and indifference among the parents whose children were found in the 
streets and asked to come to them. It was difficult to secure regular attendance, even 
in the most crowded localities, but gradually an interest and some appreciation of 
what was being done for their children began to be manifested among them; but this 
we feel was greatly due to the faithful visiting in the homes by the Kindergartner, 
where after a little time she gains the confidence of the mothers and is able to make 
useful suggestions about cleanliness, proper food, clothing, &c., but more than all 
to learn something of the children’s lives there, their temper and dispositions, for, 
even in their ignorance about any right ways of guidance or control, these people 
are often intelligent about the general characteristics of their children and able to 
give an earnest Kindergartner much help. Then the interest manifested in the chil- 
dren and families does much to encourage the parents to do something for the chil- 
dren themselves and to make them feel more responsible for them. The impression 
made upon the mothers by the patience and gentleness of the teachers is a deep one. 
The little ones often come to us so degraded and almest depraved from constant 
association with vice of every kind, lawless and defiant, using profane language with 
the ease of full grown men, untruthful, sullen, and unhappy; but gradually, in the 
most hopeless cases, habits of honesty, truthfulness, and obedience have been formed, 
impure language hushed, and some degree of gentleness and kindness toward others 
has been gained; and oh! how often wan, sad faces and lives made happy and glad! 
A truant officer in one place told me, without knowing I was interested in the 
work, that the Kindergarten had made a great change in that neighborhood ; there 
was less swearing and rudeness among the older children; he often heard the little 
ones reprove the older for using bad words and for unkind treatment. 
KINDERGARTEN AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The school board. of Milwaukee appointed a special committee in January, 1882, to 
visit St. Louis for the purpose of examining the Kindergiirten of that city which ate 
conneeted with the public school system. The committee performed their mission 
and made an elaborate report, in which the difficulties attending the maintenance 
and operation of these schools were fully explained and discussed. Yet thé commit- 
tee felt thoroughly satisfied of the practicability of establishing a Kindergarten sys- 
tem in Milwaukee. They advised cautious movements, the exercise of great care in 
the selection of Kindergartners, and the exclusive control of the Kindergirten by 
the school board. The important question seemed to be whether one teacher could 
conduct two separate classes a day. If this could be done the expense would not 
be such as to prevent the successful establishment of the system. The board came 
to the conclusion that the experiment was worth making, and that, if prudently con- 
ducted, it would probably solve the problem of infant instruction for the city. Rules 
were adopted for the regulation and government of the system which exhibit the prin- 
cipal features of the plan adopted. They are as follows: 
(1) It shall be the duty of the director of Kindergiirten to give all the instruction 
in the training school for Kindergartners and to supervise the public school Kinder- 
giirten of the eity, and she shall be director of the Kindergarten in connection with 
the training school. 
(2) The director of Kindergiirten shall be responsible for the training school for 
Kindergartners and the Kindergarten in connection therewith in the same manner 
and to the same extent as principals are for their schools, and all reports relating to 
said training school and Kindergarten shall be made to the superintendent and secre- 
tary in accordance with the rules of the board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
CvItt REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
(3) The course of study in the training school fér Kindergartners shall embrace 
thorough instruction in the philosophy and practice of Frébel’s system, includin; 
the gifts, occupations, plays, and songs, and actual training as assistant in the centr: 
and local Kindergiirten, the leading principles of bodily hygiene, the elements of men- 
tal and moral science in their relations to child education, and the general history of 
educational methods. 
(4) The training school for Kindergartners shall be open to such persons as are able 
to pass an examination as to education and personal qualifications for Kindergarten 
work, to be held by the committee on Kindergiirten, the superintendent of public 
schools, and the director of Kindergiirten. On ae the training school, the ap- 
plicant shall be put on one month’s probation, and if at the end of that time she 
gives assurance of becoming a successful Kindergartner she shall be made a regular 
member of the class. 
(5) No person shall be certified as director until she has passed a satisfactory ex- 
amination in the studies prescribed for the training school for Kindergartners and 
has by actual service proved herself proficient in the management of classes in the 
various gifts, occupations, and exercises of the Kindergarten. Certificates shall be 
good while the holders remain in the service of the board. Paid assistants who have 
attained sufficient experience to act in that capacity shall be selected from the pupils 
in the training school, and certificates shall be issued to them which shall be good 
for the school year during which they are granted. 
(6) All persons admitted to the training school for Kindergartners shall, during 
their attendance upon the same, be required to act as assistants in the local Kindergir- 
ten for one session each day, without compensation, unless when detailed to act as 
paid assistants. 
(7) The daily session of a Kindergarten shall be 3 hours. No pupil over 7 years of 
age shall be received, and no pupil shall be permitted to attend a Kindergarten and 
a class of a higher grade at the same time. 
(8) Each Kindergarten shall be entitled to a director and 1 paid assistant for 60 
pupils and an additional paid assistant for each 30 pupils over 60. No Kindergarten 
shall be opened unless an enrolment of 60 pupils can be secured. 
(9) Directors having charge of two Kindergarten classes in one day shall begin with 
the same salary and shall receive advancements on the same terms and conditions 
as teachers holding the A certificate [the highest grade], and assistants shall receive 
$20 per month for a full day’s service, Directors and assistants employed for one 
class per day shall receive one-half of this compensation. 
(10) ‘The Kindergarten shall constitute the lowest grade in the course of instruc- 
tion of the public schools and shall be treated as a department of the primary or dis- 
trict school in which it is located. Except as to such matters pertaining to the pro-’ 
gram, the details of work, and the duties of local directors as are under the immedi- 
ate supervision of the director of Kindergiirten, the Kindergarten shall be subject to 
the control of the principal of the school in which it is placed. 
(11) No Kindergarten shall be organized or conducted in any school unless upon 
the recommendation of the committee on Kindergiirten and the order of the board. 
(12) The Kindergiirten shall be under the same general supervision by the super- 
intendent of schools as are the other schools, and they shall be governed by the reg- 
ulations of the schools established by the board, except as these are modified by the 
foregoing rules. 
A FRENCH VIEW OF AMERICAN KINDERGARTEN WORK. 
The following paragraphs, translated from the report of Mlle. Loizillon on primary 
instruction in the United States, are of special interest to American readers: 
The establishment of the Kindergarten in the United States of America was a 
thoroughly feminine work, which does not date back more than a dozen or fifteen 
yours, ¢7 
It is to be feared that on account of the reception of children from the wealthier 
classes— who many times have been favored and spoiled at home —certain concessions 
will be made in the Kindergarten which may be opposed to the principles of the sys- 
tem, and, by introducing disturbing conditions, may have an unfortunate influence 
on the pupil teachers. * * * 
At Boston and St. Louis the most interesting Kindergiirten for study are to be 
found, not only on account of their number and origin, but on account of their organi- 
zation and the unity of their direction. * * * 
These establishments are noteworthy because of the buildings, furnishings, &c., 
but the retiring rooms for the children are not arranged according to the best hygienic 
ideas. * * * 
The result of the exercises in drawing on slates, in constructing solid figures, in 
combining colors, in the weaving of papers is very remarkable, The children acquire

Bread dexterity, combined with quick powers of observation, but the work should not 
e carried too far, as in one school where children of four years of age sew, cut out 
dolls’ clothes, and even mend garments. Little folks of that age are too delicate to 
wear the thimble, hold the needle, and give the strict attention required in such 
Worle et 
The teachers only have three hours’ class work each day, but the amount accom- 
plished in this short space requires such tension of mind, so much vigilance, that the 
nerve force would not suffice for a longer period. One source of fatigue is caused by 
the different nationalities present at the Kindergarten [Mrs. Shaw’s apparently ]. 
The English tongue has to be taught to the pupils. * * * 
The disposal of the different objects made at the close of each year awakens ambi- 
tious instincts at the beginning of the new term, aseach child wishes to help in re- 
decorating the school room. Then curiosity and énthusiasm are both excited. Even 
the colored children show as much amour propre in this matter as the whites. * * * 
The experiments made in St. Louis and Boston have given rise to many more or 
less successful attempts to establish similar-schools elsewhere.,* * * 
Notwithstanding the hopes that this interesting movement has awakened, it is 
impossible not to feel that the establishments due to private sources are quite in- 
sufficient. What are 232 Kindergiirten (with 8,871 pupils) to a population of more 
than 50,000,000 persons? Public generosity is inexhaustible'in the United States of 
America, especially in the interests of education; yet, even-if the number of Kinder- 
giirten be doubled in a dozen years, the situation will remain the same: there will 
be too few ~Kindergiirten for the public need. There is one point in the education of 
children in the United States which may be called a fault of the organization. As 
the school only admits pupils at the ages of 5 or 6 years it happens many times where 
the families are out at work that the children are left without any one to care for 
them, so that they run on the streets and acquire bad habits at an age when the 
powers of reasoning cannot be brought to bear. Even the Kindergarten does not 
suffice to prevent grave errors, as the little folks are only there three hours a day.4 This 
problem will only be solved when the state takes charge of the education of chil; 
dren from infancy upward. All efforts made by private parties will only have a lim- 
ited value. General measures are better. * * * 
The project of connecting the Kindergarten with the public school has been mooted. 
(in Boston'it was attempted, but found too onerous a duty), but insurmountable finan- 
cial difficulties seem to stand in the way. Notwithstanding the wealth, generosity, 
and devotion of the American people the State governments cannot impose the neces- 
sary taxes to form a budget for Kindergarten instruction in addition to what is re- 
quired for the actual organization. * * * Nothing is impossible, however, in a 
country where suggestions so soon become facts. 
But if the work of protecting little folks is to remain isolated from the rest of the 
school system it will suffice at leagt to glorify the American womep who were the 
means of founding the schools.

  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. CXV 
Application of the term secondary insiruction,x— The expression secondary instruction, 
as I have frequently had occasion to observe, is not employed in my annual report to 
designate institutions of exact and uniform grade. It has, however, proved a con- 
venient term of classification, serving as a means of bringing together and in some 
degree systematizing a mass of information that could not well be referred to any 
other head. The data thus collated afford a very fair conception of the endeavor 
made in our country te continue education beyond the elementary stage. 
Schools and enrolment.— Secondary instruction is the specific work of three classes 
of institutions: public high schools, represented in the statistical summary of pupils 
.receiving secondary instruction by city high schools, that enroll, so far as reported, 
39,581 pupils; institutions for secondary instruction, Table VI, numbering 1,482, with 
an enrolment of 138,384; preparatory schools, Table VII, numbering 154, enrolment, 
15,681; or a total enrolment of 193,646. To this must be added the students in aca- 
demic courses of normal schools, 14,464; in the preparatory departmeuts of institu- 
tions for the superior instruction of women, 8,204; preparatory departments of uni- 
versities and colleges, 31,838; and preparatory departments of schools of science, 3,381; 
making a total of 251,613 pupils receiving secondary instrnetion, 
Distribution of schools and scholars.— The distribution of the various ‘classes of in- 
stitutions engaged in the work is worthy of notice. More than two-thirds of the 
pupils in preparatory schools are reported in the New England and Middle States, 
while about the same proportion of those in the preparatory departinents of superior 
institutions are in the Southern and Western States. The ratio to the entire popula+ 
tion of the pupils receiving secondary instruction is, for the whole country, 1 in every 
199; for the New England States, 1 in 130; for the Middle States, 1 in 196; and for 
the Northern Central States, 1 in 238. 
Courses and standards.—The varied character of the schools represented in Table VI 
will be seen by examination of the extended table in the appendix, which sets forth 
very plainly the determining conditions, viz, denpminational affiliations, extent of 
patronage and resources, as funds, apparatus, and teaching force. These schools are 
responsible for the instruction of more than half the entire number of scholars in the 
secondary grade, and their labor is about equally divided between girls and boys, 
the former numbering 65,559 and the latter 69,362, Three-fifths of the students are 
in the English course and less than one-twelfth (viz, 10,753 out of a total of 138,384) 
are preparing for college. 
The schools represented in. Table VII are more uniform in character than the pre- 
ceding. While less than one-third of their students are professedly preparing for 
college, it is understood that the courses and standards for all scholars are chiefly de- 
termined by the requirements of the college entrance examinations. The compara- 
tively small number of scholars preparing for college in the schools reported in Tables 
VI and VII and the small number annually reported as proceeding from them to col- 
lege warrant the inference that both classes of schools are in the main finishing 
schools for their pupils. As such it is important that they should have at command 
all the agencies by which students are stimulated to the highest exertion, and that 
they should give to the communities in which they are placed reliable guarantees of 
their capacity to impart sound knowledge. The purpose of preparing students for 
matriculation in superior institutions has proved a great stimulus to the schools 
undertaking that work. The effect has not been confined to the students who con- 
templated entering college, but all the students have experienced the advantage of 
working in a systematic manner toward a high and definite result, 
The endeavor of certain eastern colleges to arrange for uniform courses has resulted 
in a substantial agreement as to the requirements in all ordinary subjects.1 The 
degree of uniformity secured is sufficient to facilitate the work of secondary schools 
that must prepare pupils for several of these colleges at the same time. « 
  1The institutions represented in the agreement are Harvard, Yale, Brown University, Dartmouth, 
Williams, Trinity, Amherst, Wesleyan University, Tufts, and Boston University.

    CXxVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The standard at which many candidates pass the entrance examination and their 
subsequent record in the college course indicate the need of a better adjustment be- 
tween the courses of secondary instruction and the college courses. This is even 
more apparent in the case of scholars who enter the higher schools of science. 
The desire on the part of the graduates of secondary institutions to secure some 
authoritative indorsement of their work is evidenced by the fact that numbers who 
have no intention of entering upon a college course annually pass the college entrance 
examinations, The opinion is quite general that standards differing somewhat from 
those represented in these entrance examinations, and applied by some independ- 
ent representative body, would be a better means of testing the attainments of 
graduates from secondary schools. The idea is illustrated in the regents’ examina- 
tions in New York, which have proved of great service in maintaining high standards 
in the secondary schools of that State. In 1882 the board adopted resolutions amend- 
ing the conditions on which charters would be granted to academies and on which 
academical departments of union schools would be received under visitation, te the 
end that the standard of the academies might be raised. The terms hereafter to be 
required for coming under the visitation of the regents and enjoying the advantages 
of sharing in the distribution of the literature fund are shown in the following 
resolution : 
That the ordinance of the regents in,regard to the incorpération of academies be 
amended so as ‘to require as a condition precedent to such incorporation the pos- 
‘session of property amounting to at least $5,000 over and above all incumbrances and 
that the debts shall not exceed the one-third part of said property; and that, besides 
the buildings (which, as required by law, must be of the value of at least $2,000), 
said property shall include a library of suitable books worth at least $500, and ap- 
aratus and collections suitable for instruction in physics, chemistry, and natural 
istory, worth at least $500; and that reasonable assurances exist of a sufficient in- 
come for the suitable support of said academy and of the attendance thereat of at 
least twenty-five scholars who are qualified to pursue the proper studies of an 
academy. . 
A second resolution extends the same requirements to union schools which seek to 
participate in the benefits of the fund. 
‘The whole number of academies and academical departments now carried on the 
regents’ lists is 279. In 1881~’82 reports were received from 257 of these, having an 
enrolment, of 34,171 scholars. The total amount distributed to these from the liter- 
ature fund was $40,000. 
In the preliminary examinations which determine what scholars are to be counted 
in the distribution of the fund, certificates are issued when the candidates pass satis- 
factorily in arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and spelling. In 1881~82 the 
number of these certificates issued was 4,202. The advanced examination for the 
academic diploma is recognized throughout the State asa valuable standard of scholar- 
ship. In ‘the university convocation held July, 1882, these examinations were the 
subject of earnest discussion, and many suggestions were made that promise to re- 
sult in practical measures for increasing their scope and force. 
Effects of recent movements.—The movement for the higher education of women has 
had a favorable effect upon secondary instruction. During the past few years a num- 
ber of excellent schools have been established for the pupose of fitting girls for the 
colleges open to them, schools previously existing have shown the beneficial effects 
of the higher standards and more definite aims in woman’s education, while coeduca- 
tion schools have been relieved somewhat from the embarrassing necessity of arrang- 
ing special courses for girls without lowering their general standard. 
I have also to note increasing provision for those courses and methods of training 
by which students are properly prepared for the higher schools of science. Progress in 
this respect is hindered by two conditions: the cost of laboratories and apparatus 
and the difficulty of finding competent teachers. Only schools well endowed or ia 
receipt of public appropriations are able to incur the necessary expense,

HIGH SCHOOLS. CxvVII 
High schools.—The tabular representation of public high schools is less complete 
than is desired, being confined to city high schools,! representing 29 States and 
1 Territory. The reported enrolment in these, viz, 39,581 pupils, is equal to 1 in 
every 286 of our urban population as given in the census of 1880, Neither this average 
estimate nor the larger ratio of attendance which is shown by-the records of particular 
cities? warrants the notion that the high schools render any considerable portion of 
our youth either visionary or averse to industry. The cause of such tendencies must 
be sought in our social and industrial habits rather than in our schools. The require- 
ments for admission to the high schools are such as to insure a class of pupils well pre- 
pared for the work of this grade, a very important consideration ; since, if on the one 
hand it be urged that these schools are a public expense, on the other it wouhl be 
found that they are engaged in the training and culture of minds whose deyelopment 
is likely to prove a public advantage. 
In the Northwestern States the policy of making high school ‘courses preliminary 
to the courses in the State universities is proving doubly advantageous. It promises 
on the one hand to relieve the higher institutions of the burden of preparatory work 
and on the other it greatly improves the quality of instruction in the high schools. 
In 1881 the legislature of Minnesota enacted a law for the encouragement of higher 
education, in accordance with which appropriations are made to high schools con- 
ducted according to specified regulations and passing final inspection in the visitation 
of the State high school board and in the report of the examiner. ‘fhe conditions of 
admission to the list of schools entitled to aid are as follows: Pe 
There must be a well organized graded school, having not less than three distinct 
departments below the high school, and ineluding not less than eight years of element- 
ary and grammar school instruction. 
ae school must be provided with suitable rooms, furniture, and apparatus for good 
work. 
The school shall hold sessions of not less than eight months each year. Each depart- 
ment shall be supplied with a teacher whose qualifications have been certified to 
upon examination by an authorized examiner of the district, county, or State. 
The high school department shall consist of at least twenty pupils, who shall be en- 
tered upon examination as provided for in the regulations. Not less than five of this 
department shall pursue the entire university preparatory course, and shall be known 
as the university preparatory class. 
Others of the high school may omit Latin, in the discretion of the principal. 
The high school shall be open, free of tuition, to all non-resident pupils upon pass- 
ing the examination required. 
High schools not receiving aid under this statute, yet desiring to avail themselves 
of the advantages of the State examinations as in lieu of the entrance examinations 
to the university, as provided by the board of regents, shall, upon application, be 
accepted and be entitled to the same privileges as those receiving aid. 
‘The course of study shall include as its minimum the following course, to be known 
as the university preparatory course: 
First year. Higher arithmetic, elementary algebra, English grammar (including 
analysis), geography, and United States history reviewed, Latin grammar and reader. 
Second year. Natural philosophy, physical geography, elementary astronomy, gen- 
eral history, plane geometry, physiology, Cwsar (first three books in 1882-83), Cicero 
(first oration against Catiline). : 
Third year. Elementary chemistry, geometrical drawing, botany, ancient history, 
algebra to quadratic equations, solid geometry, Cicero (last three orations against 
ea a mana with an examination for both years in Cicero), Virgil (first four 
ooks in 83).

pupil has completed a prescribed course of study in a commissioned high school en-

titles the holder to admission to the State university or to Purdue University. The 
following is the minimum course: 
Reading, writing, orthography, geography, English grammar, word analysis, United 
States history, physiology, arithmetic, elementary and higher algebra, geometry (first 
four books), Latin grammar, Latin reader, Latin prose composition, Cesar (two 
books), and Virgil (two books). 
It has sometimes been represented that the high schools are too largely devoted to 
the work of preparing students for college, and must therefore be regarded asserving 
@ particular class rather than the general public. The ohjection is not well taken, 
as the superior education of a few is in itself a means of public good. But while the 
high sehools have achieved an enviable reputation for their success in preparing can- 
didates for college, an examination of their courses of study and of the subsequent 
careers of their graduates will show that this is by no means their chief merit. 
The high schools offer the only provision accessible to the majority of our teachers 
for that extended culture whose advantages are nowhere more needed or moredirectly 
exercised for the public advantage than in the places which these teachers fill. 
Great care has also been taken to include in the courses of the high school those 
branches of study that prepare men for the intelligent conduct of the public duties 
which may devolve upon any citizen of a republic. Political economy, civil govern- 
ment, mental science, and ethics are features in the curricula of many high schools. 
Science occupicS a prominent place in most of the courses, and the appliances for 
“teaching the same are in general very good. The need of a specific business course 
in the high schools is recognized in a number of cities, and in a few instances provi- 
sion has been made for the same. 
In this connection the following statements from current reports are interesting: 
[Extract from the report of Hon. A.J. Moulder, superintendent of public schools, San Francisoo, 
Cak, 1883.) \ 
At avery early date it became apparent that the usefulness of the boys’ high school 
could-be greatly increased by the addition of a commercial or business course to the 
three courses already established. It was believed that such an addition would tend 
to popularize the institution and remove many of the objections heretofore urged 
against it. The superintendent therefore introduced such a measure, and it was 
unanimously adopted by the board of education, to take effect on the reopening of 
the school in July. The new course is intended to prepare young men not simply to 
become book-keepers, but to fit them for practical business in almost any vocation. 
Tt embraces all the branches usually taught in a first class business college, besides 
instruction in the ordinary English studies and in the natural sciences. The full 
course is of equal dignity with the other three courses in the school and extends 
through a period of three years. In it will be tanght business penmanship, business 
arithmetic, book-keeping, business forms, commercial law, geography, with special 
reference to its use in commerce and trade. = 
The youth who graduates in this course ought not only to be a fair English scholar, 
with some knowledge of the sciences, but he should be competent to enter at once 
into any business enterprise. His abilities and his attainments will undoubtedly 
render his services of immediate and practical value to any employer secking a skilled 
assistant in his business. 
Ihave already received such assurances from parents and teachers as to satisfy me 
that the new course will meet a long felt want and that over one hundred students 
will enter it at the beginning of the next school term. Should there be a sufficient 
demand for it, I am in favor of establishing a similar course for the benefit of the pu- 
pils in the girls’ high school. 
[Extract from the report of Hon. Norman Bridge, president of the Chicago board of education.| 
The number of pupils attending the high schools during the year was 1,436, or 1.98 
per cent. of the whole number of pupils (72,509) attending all the schools. Of these 
1,436 pupils, 403 were boys and 1,033 were girls.

Thus it, happens that, while the boys are in the minority at beginning, most of them 
drop out before the end of the course, This is greatly to be regretted: there ought 
Ao be a larger number of boys, exclusive of those attending other institutions of 
learning, in a city of over half a million people who can and will pursue to com- 
pletion the high school course of study. 
Many of the boys who leave the high schools before the end of the course do so be- 
cause obliged to go to work; others, because the bustle and promises of business are 
more alluring than school and they prefer to go to work. Cuan the course not be 
made more inviting to them without lessening, but with increasing, its usefulness for 
them? Most undoubtedly the addition of a course in manual training and business 
methods would aaseuigiy this end. The experience of the schools of manual train- 
ing is that constant care must be exercised lest the pupils neglect their literary 
studies for the drawing and the shop, the tools and the things. The addition of some 
short course of this kind—even tentatively and in a small way —to our high school 
curriculum, for such boys as elect to take it, would at once, if we may judge by 
the experience of others, increase the charm and usefulness of these schools for a very 
considerable number of pupils, many of whom now receive little or no instruction 
after leaving the grammar school. 
I know it is said that there is no room in our high school course for industrial studies, 
and that therefore the suggestion is impracticable. But such a position is absurd, 
since the manual training schools are nothing but high schools with the practical part 
added and some or all the studies of the dead languages cut off. It cannot be im- 
possible—it ought not to be difficult —to ingraft a department of manual training 
ore our high school course; nor need the trial step be costly. It is my belief that 
the time has come for an innovation in this direction, and that the board ought to 
take up the consideration of the subject with this end in view. 
The Washington High School affords an example of an institution of this grade 
conducted with special reference to the mental discipline and culture of the scholars, 
the demands for business training being partially met by the plan of study in the 
grade preceding. The work of the high school is thus outlined by Superintendent 
Wilson : 
The high school course or courses of study cover a period of three years. The 
standard for admission and average age of pupils are about one year in advance of 
those usually required, and the full course one year less.    
  The following statement, preliminary to the courses of study, briefly explains the 
plan of organization: 
The studies of the high school embrace mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural 
science, business training, English, German, French, Latin, Greek, history, political 
science, and drawing. For convenience of classification three leading courses of study 
are outlined, but no one of these is inevery part compulsory. Subject to the require- 
ments of the hour plan of recitations, a pupil, acting with the approval of his parents 
or guardian, may determine his own course of study. As an aid in the pursnit of the 
different studies, whenever practicable, a syllabus is prepared and furnished to the 
pupil, containing an analysis of topics and giving references, both general and spe- 
cial, to works in the school library which the pupil is expected to consult. 
The studies are made as fully elective as any plan of recitations in such a school 
will allow; each teacher has a special department of work; physics, chemistry, and 
botany each has its laboratory fitted up and furnished appropriately.

Cxx REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The opposition to high schools is renewed from time to time in different quarters, 
but generally results in establishing them more securely in the confidence of the 
people. Such promises to be the outcome of a recent experience of this kind in De- 
troit, Mich., concerning which the president of the Detroit board of education, Hon. a 
E. C. Warner, reports as follows: 
In view of a report of a committee of the old board of estimates made to that body 
and of a resolution adverse to the support of the high school from “money raised by 
taxation for the maintenancaqof free common schools” adopted by the common coun- 
cil of the city, a special committee was appointed to consider and report upon the fol- 
lowing propositions: 
(A) Whether, in view of the established character of the high school as an existing 
institution, there are sufficient grounds for its discontinuance. 
(B) If not, whether a certain fee or charge ought to be made to those seeking its 
privileges, with suitable provisions against excluding any not reasonably able to 
comply with the requirement. 
(C) Whether foreign languages ought to be eliminated from the regular course of 
study, and, if not, whether a tuition fee ought to be charged for instruction in them. 
The committee appointed to consider these propositions was composed of able and 
intelligent members of the board, who brought to the deliberations of the committee 
extensive research, mature judgment, and a conscientious desire to determine the 
question fairly and justly, with due regard to the rights and opinions of individuals 
upon the one hand who believed that the high school should be eliminated from our 
public school system, and to opinions of those on the other who believe in maintain- 
ing the present policy of free liberal education in advanced or high school grades. 
The question received deliberate and careful consideration, and the worthy chair- 
man, Inspector Griffin, submitted an able and exhaustive report, which was concurred 
in by the entire committee, wherein the State legislation was reviewed, arguments 
pro and con weighed, statistics cited, and logic brought to bear, and wherein the com- 
mittee unanimously reported that, “in the best judgment of the committee, impressed 
with the grave responsibility which rests upon them, and enlightened by every source 
of information reasonably accessible, and carefully weighing all suggestions in oppo- 
sition to their present conclusion, conceding to all who may differ from them sincerity 
in their convictions, the high school ought to be maintained with substantially its 
present course of study. 
Hon. Robert Graham, State superintendent of schools, Wisconsin, gives the follow- 
ing comprehensive view of the operation of the high schools in his State, established 
by the law of 1875: 
By this measure a new and important class of schools have been brought into ex- 
istence; a class of schools with a clearly defined course of study, prescribed by, or 
having the approval of, the State,superintendent, and in charge of teachers qualified 
by holding diplomas or some form of State certificate or by special examination in 
the branches included in the course of study. More than that, these schools have 
afforded a field for observation, a scope for experience, which ought to prove of great 
value in considering and determining the features to be insisted upon in such schools, 
and their real value and function in our system of schools. This observation and 
experience leads to inquiry in two directions: First, the relation of these and similar 
schools to higher education; second, their relation to the elementary or common dis- 
trict schools, 
_No words can so clearly and emphatically answer these inquiries as the statistics 
relating to these schools. 
(1) They meet a demand that is felt in nearly every community and are highly ap- 
preciated wherever established under fair conditions for success. This is indicated by 
the fact that in 98 free high schools reporting the present year there was an enrol- 
ment of 6,528 pupils, an average of 66 pupils to each school, who attended an avernee 
of 116.6 days, or nearly 6 months of 20 days each; and by the further fact that $10,3¢ 
was collected as tuition fees from such as were not entitled to attend them without 
charge —an average of more than $100 for each school. Eighty-seven of these schools 
had an average daily attendance of more than 25, while but 11 had an average daily 
attendance of less than that number, 
(2) These schools, notwithstanding the efforts and inducements to secure their or- 
ganization and management in organic relation to collegiate and university courses 
of study, and directly tributary to fage institutions of learning, are largely attended 
by such as seek for a better equipment for immediaty and active business than the 
common schools afford, and not in any great numbers by those seeking fit preparation 
for collegiate courses of study. Of the 6,528 enrolled in these schools last year, but 
367 —a little more than 5 per cent. — completed either course of study. During the 
seven years the schools have been in progress, but 2,418 have completed a course of 
study. Furthermore, while both English and classical courses of study are provided, 
 
-P-A-G-E-121

and while German is an optional study in the English course, the number of pupils 
instructed in English branches only during the last year was 5,546, while the number 
instructed in other than English branches, which, of course, includes such as chose 
German among the elective studies of the English course, was but 982, about one- 
seventh of the number enrolled. * * * * * * * 
If the statistics were attainable, there is no doubt but that another very important 
way in which these schools exert a useful and wide reaching influence would be found 
in the opportunity they afford young people to prepare themselves in scholarship for 
the position of teachers in the elementary schools. ‘rom the reports that inei- 
dentally reach the office of the State superintendent, it is presumable that between 
5 and 25 persons are found in each of these schools every year who are intending to 
teach and are there to fit themselves for so doirtg. If the medium number of the 
extremes mentioned is assumed to be the average number which each school thus 
yearly sends out as teachers in the common schools, then we have a measure for esti- 
mating their value and influence expressed by more than 1,500 such teachers. 
It will readily be seen that the possibilities of these schools as helpful factors in 
improving the common schools are very great and far exceed any result hitherto 
realized. It gives me pleasure to be able to state that the attention and interest of 
some of the principals of these schools have been awakened, and inquiry has been 
started whether, in addition to scholastic equipment, they may not do something 
directly in training these embryo teachers in the schools under their charge in the 
theory and art of teaching. Some tentative experiments are already being made in 
the direction indicated. 
Finances,— It is impossible to present a statement of the funds available for second- 
ary instruction in our country, since the appropriations to public institutions of this 
grade are reported in totals with other funds. 
The funds invested in the schools in Table VI, including value of grounds, build- 
ings, apparatus, and productive funds, are reported as $34,412,034; in those of Table 
VII, $7,606,795. The income of the former schools for the year, including interest 
on productive funds and tuition fees, was $3,331,743, or $24 per capita of reported 
enrolment; that of the schools in Table VII, $742,916, or $47 per capita of reported en- 
rolment. These funds, as the tables show, are very unequally distributed throughout 
the country, and are not reported in all cases. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 
In 1865 the British schools inquiry commission instituted a special examination 
‘nto the condition of secondary schools, which gave an impetus to measures for the 
extension and improvement of the means of secondary instructioh. A brief notice of 
what is now going on in Great Britain will not be out of place here, more especially 
as the conditions affecting secondary schools in that country are very similar to those 
existing among ourselves. 
Nearly all the universities maintain examinations for secondary schools and schol- 
ars. The examinations under the auspices of the two older universities are naturally 
most generally known and most extensively employed. 
The report of the Oxford local examinations show that for the year 1882 the num- 
ber of girls examined was 777; number of boys, 1,360; numbers passed: girls, 473; 
boys, 810; total examined, 2,137; passed, 1,283. Thus far, 1,889 candidates have pre- 
sented themselves for examination in 1883. 
The total number of candidates who presented themselves for the Cambridge local 
examinations in 1882 was 7,640, viz: 4,574 boys and 3,066 girls. The tenth annual re- 
port of the Oxford and Cambridge schools examination board for the year ending 
October 31, 1883, gives a total of 60 boys’ schools and 27 girls’ schools examined dur- 
ing the year. 
The College of Preceptors is doing a great and important work in the examination 
of secondary schools. 2 
In 1883 it examined 14,000 candidates, coming from some 2,000 schools; in 1879 the 
number of pupils examined was 7,000, representing about 700 schools, so that the 
work of the society was more than doubled in four years. 
The schools of the Girls’ Public Day School Company enrolled about 5,400 pupils in 
1883, The success of these schools has led to the formation of a Boys’ Public Day School 
Company for the promotion of intermediate schools for boys.

CXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
It is admitted that. private endowments and denominational zeal are not suflicient 
to accomplish all that is required in this department. ‘No educational system, ” says 
Mr. Mundella, “is complete which does not provide what we call the ladder, It is no 
use relying on an elementary system which does not bridge over the gulf between the 
public school and the university.” In accordance with these views various plans 
have been adopted for establishing a connection between the elementary schools and 
the higher institutions of learning. The school boards of the principal cities of Eng- 
land haye scholarships at their disposal that enable successful competitors from the 
elementary schools to enter one or other of the great public schools, and in a num- 
ber of cities “higher board schools,” corresponding to high schools in this country, 
have been established. 
Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds, and Bradford have taken the lead in this work. 
In his attempt to reform education in Scotland Lord Young saw the importance of 
giving distinct recognition to three grades of institutions, elementary, secondary or 
higher class schools, and universities. The act in which his yiews were embodied 
specified the schools which should be regarded as higher class schools and the means 
of testing their efficiency in the branches required, viz: Latin, Greek, modern lan- 
guages, mathematics, and natural science, with a view, asthe act expressly stated, “‘ to 
promote the higher education of the country.” 
Eleven such schools were originally designated, whichnumber has increased to 
eighteen, situated in the larger towns. To these must be added a number of elementary 
schools with flourishing secondary departments. These schools are not, however, in 
number or resources adequate to the end in view, namely, ‘‘supplying the whole of 
Scotland with secondary education,” a work which it is acknowledged cannot. be ac- 
complished. 
- “The Scotch feeling,” says Professor Laurie,” is entirely different from the English 
on this point. The Scotch people do not wish to see tlteir secondary schools and uni- 
versities independent of the state, and they believe, with the Germans, that it is the 
duty of the state to render them as complete as they can be made.” Great hopes are 
entertained that the commission created by the educational endowments act passed 
in 1882 will be able to do much for secondary education by bringing to its service 
many endowments now running to waste. 
In all these movements in Great Britain the importance of science instruction aid 
the means of adjusting the secondary schools to the requirements of industrial and 
business life are made prominent. It is gratifying to observe that in this respect Eng- 
lishmen acknowledge that we have made greater advance than themselves. 
OVERWORK IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
The following is a brief statement of official action in several German States respect- 
ing overwork in Gymnasien and Realschulen: 
After the opinion became general in Germany that numerous pressing reforms in 
the hygienic treatment of pupils and the arrangements of scheol buildings were neces- 
sary, the educational authorities began to investigate the matter out of deference to the 
warnings of physicians and the pressure of public opinion. Asa consequence, many im- 
provements lave been made in school arrangements and in the management of scholars. 
These changes are made in obedience to ministerial decrees, the most recent of 
which deal with the scope and methods of teaching, the number of hours of study 
and the amount of home study, and are designed to put a check upon the overwork 
and haste in study about which there has been so much complaint recently. They 
refer especially to overwork as it exists in the higher institutions: Gymnasien, Real- 
schulen, and other secondary schools. This official action is of the more consequence 
because school directors and members of school boards participated in the delibera- 
tions which preceded the preparation of the decrees.g The decrees referred to were 
issued by the governments of, Prussia, Saxony, Wiirttemberg, Baden, Hesse, and 
Alsace-Lorraine. 
The Prussian publication is a circular of March 31, 1882. Itis in reference to a 
revision of the system of instruction, and makes some explanations thereof, in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION ABROAD. OXXIII 
attention is called to certain dangers arising from overwork to which school children 
are liable. This circular leaves the total number of weekly school hours tnchanged, 
but introduces some changes of arrangement calculated to lighten the labor of the 
scholars. 
The Saxon decrees are dated March 4 and March 10, 1882. They refer to the ear- 
nest discussions in the Landtag on overwork in schools, and state that the government 
is fally in accord with those members of the Landtag who believe that there is a 
necessity for regulations which shall reach the question of overwork, and then give 
particular directionsaffecting the scope and method of instruction, but without touching 
the subjects of home work, the number of school hours, and other matters. It is in- 
teresting to observe that the Saxon government is of the opinion that the object and 
scope of instruction in the classical languages are exceeded in the Gymnasien ; that de- 
voting special attention to philological sciences is detrimental to the unity and harmony 
of gymnasial instruction, and that in many cases instruction in ancient languages is 
turned into teaching philology as a profession instead of giving a general intellectual 
training. Besides being the cause of overwork, therefore, the system of instruction in 
ancient languages, which takes up most of the time in Gymnasien, is faulty in other 
respects. Indeed, the Saxon decree goes further and declares that the requirements 
in other departments, in natural history, mathematics, and history, are too high, and 
that anticipation is often carried to such an extent that little is left for the university. 
The expressions of this decree with reference to essays on given subjects which the 
students translate into a foreign language on dictation and write down without 
preparation are also very important. These essays (extemporalia) hold a very im- 
portant position at present in gymnasial instruction, so that in many of these insti- 
tutions conclusions as to the progress, ability, and industry of students are drawn 
solely or almost solely from their success in preparing the papers in question. There 
would be some ground for this if the subjects were invariably so arranged as to present 
no special difficulties to students of moderate talents and somewhat slow minds, But 
this is not always the case. According to the decree under consideration the essays in 
question are often mere collections of questions in syntax, which produce in the student 
a feeling of anxiety and vexation instead of an agreeable consciousness of knowledge. 
This is the kind of evil to which the Saxon ministry objects and the removal of which 
is of the greatest necessity, because nothing is more likely to produce nervous excite- 
ment and the intellectual languor following it than the frequent writing of difficult 
compositions which the students know will have an effect on their rank, This state 
of things did not exist thirty years ago. 
The decree of the Wiiritemberg government on the subject of overwork anpesradi in 
1883. No medical men took part in the deliberations which preceded its publication, 
and yet the necessity of limiting the requirements in certain branches and of changes 
in several particulars in the methods of instruction was as clearly recognized as in 
the Prussian decrees. It seems hardly necessary to enter into details concerning it 
at present, but it should be said that a commission composed exclusively of teachers 
acceded to the recommendations. 
The Baden ministry published an outline of a decree on March 18, 1883 (finally 
issued January 17, 1884), which had been prepared by the board of health in concert 
with a number of teachers. It takes up the question of the number of school hours a 
week, home study, the method of instruction, gymnastics, and certain necessary 
hygienic arrangements of school buildings. In Baden the different classes of the 
Gymnasium have had 30, 31, 32, and 34 hours of study a week without counting elective 
studies and gymnastics. They have now been changed to 28 and 32 hours for the two 
groups of classes below and above the secunda. This change will be especially bene- 
ficial to students of the tertig class, whose time of life renders them peculiarly sus- 
ceptible to injury to health fromoverwork. Before 1869 the total number of hours of 
study was 269 a week for a Baden Gymnasium of 9 classes, after 1869 it was 286, and 
it is now 268. Eachstudy hour is to be limited to 50 minutes. The amount of home
-P-A-G-E-124
CXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
study is also definitely fixed and the method of instruction has been modified in 
some points. That these changes were necessary is shown by the fact that in the 
lowest class of a Gymnasium 1,300 Latin words have to be learned the first quarter of 
the year, and nearly as many the second, which makes a daily average of about 
twenty words. It is impossible to expect that’ young students can remember all 
these words, because some of them are not met with in any author read by the 
students until they reach the upper classes, and are also special expressions of an- 
cient life, which a nine-year old boy knows nothing about and of whose German 
equivalents even he is ignorant. This is pure parrotry and is certainly without 
value. Learning by rote—committing to memory —is good enough in its way, but 
not when applied to things which are not understood by the learner. The intellect- 
ual effort required to memorize in this way leads to bad mental effects on account of 
the excessive brain effort the young students are compelled to make. 
The Hessian government issued decrees about home study as early as 1877 and 
again in 1881. Nevertheless complaints were still made about the overwork of 
young scholars. In order to determine how just these complaints were, a commis- 
sion, consisting of 8 school directors, 4 physicians, and 7 members of the chamber of 
deputies, who were also fathers of students in secondary institutions, was appointed 
to investigate the matter and report. In December, 1882, this commission published 
from the stenographic records a complete report of its proceedings. The ministry 
adopted a large part of the recommendations and embodied them in two decrees of 
February 23,1883. One of these is devoted to regulating the quantity of home study, 
and establishes a maximum which amounts to an hour a day for the lowest classes, 
and gives particular directions to prevent exceeding the t. Theother makes such 
changes in the system of teaching as will lessen the amount of study bestowed on 
Latin andGreek:; It is worthy of note that these decrees absolutely prohibit all tests 
of the student’s progress which require much reviewing, because the work demanded 
of him in this way is regarded as injurious to his bodily and intellectual health, and 
they expressly command that the day and hour for these test exercises shall not be 
announced to the students more thantwenty-four hours before they take place. These 
decrees will also have the effect of lessening the amount of memorizing. 
The decree of the Stadtholder of Alsace-Lorraine on the subject of schools is based on 
the well known report of the commission appointed in April, 1882. This commission 
was composed of 9 physicians and 2 members of the superior school board, The 
report recommended a maximum number of hours a week of home study, a certain 
amount of physical exercise, precautions to be taken to protect the eyesight, and 
some improvements in the arrangements of the school rooms. A restriction of the 
hours of labor and of home study was desirable, because it was found that the children 
were suffering from overwork. The following is a summary of the conclusions of the 
report of the medical commission: 
(1) Scholars should not be occupied with school duties more ‘than the following 
number of hours a week:

(2) Between every two hours of instruction there should be an intermission of ten 
minutes. If more than two hours of work follow each other, there should be an in- 
termission of fifteen minutes between the second and third and of twenty minutes 
between the fourth and fifth. 
(3) There should be a half holiday in the middle and at the end of the week. 
(4) No work should be done between the forenoon and afternoon hours of the same 
day and no work should be done on Sunday. 
(5) The autumn yacation should begin on the first of August and last until the
-P-A-G-E-125

middle of September. No school work should be done during the Whitsuntide and 
Christmas holidays. 
(6) The practice of giving hot weather half holidays is advisable and should be 
maintained. 
(7) The greatest number of scholars which should be permitted in one room should 
be determined according to Pettenkofer’s rule. [Pettenkofer’s calculation of the 
amount of ventilation needed for each individual was based on the assumption that 
the proportion of carbonic acid gas, including that due to respiration, should not 
exceed .7 in 1,000 parts of room air. Starting from this basis he estimated that 60 
cubic metres, or 2,119 cubie feet, of fresh air are needed for the use of a male adult 
every hour. ] 
(8) Restriction of competitive exercises and avoidance of partial accentuation in 
ex tempore exercises, and of all excessive efforts in preparing for examinations are 
recommended, i 
(9) Studies which make severe demands on the reflection and memory should be 
confined to the forenoon. 
(10) Besides the obligatory instruction in gymnastics, swimming exercises, open 
air sports, excursions, and skating are strongly recommended. Eight hours a week 
should be devoted to bodily exercis 
(11) New buildings for secondary schools where¢the class rooms are less than five 
meters wide should be lighted by a single row of windows on the left of the scholars. 
Where the rooms are wider the windows may be placed on both sides and in excep; 
tional cases light may be admitted behind the scholars. 
(12) When light is admitted on one side only, care must be taken'to select the east, 
west, or north side for that purpose. 
(18) In school buildings already existing those rooms which are lighted from the 
south entirely should not be used as class rooms: 
(14) Where rooms do not have a sufficient amount of light more must be provided 
by bevelling the edges of the window apertures and making new windows in the npper 
part of the walls between the windows. 
(15) Badly lighted rooms, especially those in the corners of quadrangular court- 
yards, should zot be used as class rooms. “ 
(16) Every school room should be provided with window shades and means for 
supplying sufficient artificial light. 
(17) The desks should be placed so that light can fall directly on each. Therefore 
where the spaces between the windows are wide the floor shaded by these spaces must 
be kept free from desks. 
(18) Surfaces which reflect light strongly, such as white walls and the like, should 
not be permitted in the neighborhood of school buildings. 
(19) All wrongly built seats should be removed from the schools forthwith and re- 
placed by others made on rational principles. 
(20) The school books, maps, and atlases should be examined with reference to the 
size of the type, form of letters, and their spacing. All books, &c., not answering 
the requirements should be gradually excluded from the schools. 
(21) The plan of studies should be arranged so that a regular alternation may take 
place in the occupations of the scholars as ar as possihle, and particular care should 
be taken to avoid studies requiring reading during several successive hours. 
(22) Near-sighted scholars should be placed in the best lighted seats and be ex- 
cused from all work which taxes the eyes. Drawing fine lines in maps or geometrical 
figures should be avoided. 
(23) Standard regulations with regard to the construction, regulation, and endow- 
ment of secondary schools should be published. 
(24) Proposals for altering a school building of the secondary grade or building a 
new one should be examined by a medical expert or medical officer to see if they con- 
form with the regulations.

Statistics in detail of schools for the superior instruction of women will be found 
in Table VIII of the appendix. The summary kere presented shows a total of 227 
institutions, with 2,721 instructors and 28,726 students, as against 226 institutions, 
with 2,211 instructors and 26,041 students, in 1881. Five colleges for women in New 
York State, which on account of their relation to the University of New York are 
included in Table IX, report 812 students; ! coeducation colleges and schools of science, 
Tables IX and X, show an enrolment of 10,869 women students, making altogether a 
total enrolment,of 40,407 women in institutions for superior instruction. Of this 
number 16,106 are reported in the preparatory departments and 18,047 in collegiate, 
special, and post graduate courses, the classification of the remainder not being 
specified. 
The item of property valuation is very fully reported for schools of Table VIII, 
amounting in the whole to $10,017,041. The amount of productive funds reported is 
$1,116,211; income from the same, $53,063. Tuition fees, it will be seen, are the chiet 
source of support for schools of this class. The total number of these institutions 
authorized by law to confer collegiate degrees is 142, of which 111 are in the Southern 
and Southern Central States. The total number of degrees conferred in 1882 was 
904, of which 684. are reported frum the two sections just named. 
Every year shows a slight increase in the number of women brought under instruc- 
tion in schools that maintain high standards and an increase in the enrolment of 
women in collegiate courses, No unusual progress in this direction has been apparent 
since my last report. The advocates of equal provision for both sexes in the East have 
labored with undiminished ardor to bring about that arrangement. The West has 
given new evidence of the liberal policy that has led in the past to identical provision

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. CXXIX 
4 » 
for both sexes in the leading colleges, and in the South the demand is arising for more 
satisfactory guarantees from so called superior schools for girls of their fitness as re- 
gards resources, equipments, and standards. The need of a well endowed college for 
girls at some central location in the South is urged upon the attention of those who | 
are known to be ready to devote money and influence to the public good. The prefor- | 
ence of the South is for separate institutions for the tio sexes. A young southern 
girl recently completed with distinction the full a, m. course of Vanderbilt University, . 
obtaining her degree when just passing out of her teens. ' 
No change has taken place since my last report in the attitude of any of the older 
eastern colleges with reference to the admission of women, but the sentiment in fayor 
of equal and identical provision for both sexes has undoubtedly become deeper and 
more extended. This is due in part to the statements of the presidents of coeduca- 
tion colleges as to the excellent results of the policy, but more to the effect produced 
by the subsequent careers of women graduates. Wherever they have been called on 
to exercise their attainments, whether in the domestic circle, in society, or in busi- 
ness, the value of their training has been demonstrated. 
Movements for improving the living conditions of our communities, for the relief 
of the poor, for the control of the lawless, for the care and instruction of neglected 
children, owe much to the efforts of women who have brought to the discussion of 
these practical problems the force and method of trained minds. One of the best 
outcomes of the higher education of women has been the formation of societies of 
women for the promotion of that interest. .At the first public meeting of the Asso- 
ciation for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York, the followjng 
resolutions were presented by Dr. William H. Draper: 
Whereas the progress made by women in the prosecution of the studies usually 
tangae in the higher institutions of learning in this country and abroad has conclu- 
sively shown that women are not incapacitated by any supposed physical or mental 
inferiority from taking their part on an equal footing with men ; 
And whereas there are many women who, without the aid of systematic training, 
are unable to develop their natural capacity for literature, science, and art, to some 
of whom the advantage of a collegiate education is of vital importance and who can- 
not rest satisfied with any instruction short of the best; 
And whereas the opening of colleges to women cannot fail to improve the general 
system of school education from the primary to the final grade, giving it a thorough, 
practical, and definite standard by which to regulate the ordinary instruction of girls: 
Resolved, That it is the undoubted right of women to have as complete and unfet- 
tered an opportunity for developing and training their mental faculties as men now 
have; that this meeting therefore cordially approves the objects of the Association 
for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York, and considers that it 
would be most desirable that the higher institutions of learning should open their 
lectures and examinations to properly qualified women on the same terms as to men ; 
that this meeting expresses its obligations to President Barnard, of Columbia Col- 
lege, for pointing out, in his recent annual reports, how an ancient and nobly en- 
dowed institution like Columbia College can increase its field of usefulness by adapt- 
ing itself to these requirements. 
The position of Columbia College with reference to the admission of women was 
thoroughly discussed and the following petition was approved: 
We, the undersigned, residents of New York City and its neighborhood, beg leave 
to present our respectful petition: That, in view of the present state of public opinion 
both here and in other countries touching the justice and expediency of admitting 
women to the same educational advantages as men, a state of opinion especially evi- 
denced by the recent action of the English universities of Cambridge and London, and 
in view of the influential position of Columbia College as among the oldest and most 
richly endowed educational institutjons in the United States and preéminently rep- 
resenting the intellectual interests of the city of New York, you will be pleased to con- 
sider how best to extend, with as little delay as possible, to such properly qualified 
women as may desire it the many and great benefits of education in Columbia Collego 
by admitting them to lectures and examinations. 
The last report of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women 
contains the following announcement : $ 
In union there is strength, and we are glad to number among signs of progress and; 
guarantees of permanence the formation in Boston, January 14, 1882, of an associa~

tion of collegiate alumni. They organized with 66 women, graduates of Oberlin, 
Vassar, Smith, Wellesley Colleges, and Cornell, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Boston 
Universities. The power of this association, with its branches, to advance the cause 
of the higher education of women can scarcely be overestimated. They have issued 
so far two circulars of information, one relating to opportunities for post graduate 
work and the other an earnest appeal for the physical education of women. Their 
object and their methods call for a hearty Godspeed from every man and woman who 
realizes that the possibilities of a people are measured by the position and condition 
of its women. 
The Women’s Education Association, Boston, has accomplished a great work in 
extending provision for the special training of women and in assisting struggling 
students through their graduate and post-graduate courses. The need of such assist- 
ance is universally recognized and has been generally accomplished for men by means 
of scholarship funds. The amount of such funds at the disposal of women is ex- 
tremely limited. An increased liberality in this direction is one of the most urgent 
needs of the time. 
HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN ABROAD. 
In consideration of the interest manifested in the United States with reference to 
provision in foreign countries for the education of women, I deem it advisable to 
present a summary of information drawn from the files of this Office, designating with 
some degree of fulness the superior institutions engaged in the work, the standards 
they maintain, and, so far as possible, the number of students who avail themselves 
of the privileges offered.

time as the subject of the second examination or later, at the option of the candidate. 
The following universities admit women to the same examinations as men and con- 
fer upon them the same degrees and honors: Londen University, Victoria University, 
and Royal University, Ireland.

The Oxford Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women reports that 
in 1882 the number of women attending the lectures of the association (which are 
delivered by Oxford professors and tutors) showed considerable increase. In Decem- 
ber, 1881, 8 women went in for the first examinations and 4 passed. In June, 1882, 
out of 15 candidates for the same examination 10 were successful; while for the 
second (honors) examination there were 5 candidates, of whom 3 gained first classes 
in their relative subjects, one a second, and the fifth a third. 
From the twenty-fifth annual report of the Cambridge local examinations syndicate 
it appears that .examinations were held at 114 centres for girls. Number of girls 
entered, 3,066, viz, 1,793 juniors and 1,273 seniors. Number of junior girls examined, 
1,140; percentage passed, 71.5; percentage failed, 28.5; number of senior girls examined, 
1,238 ;, passed, 56 per cent. ; failed, 44 per cent. The twenty-sixth Cambridge Univer- 
sity local examinations (i. e., December, 1883) obtained a larger entry than ever be- 
fore. Out of a total of 8,287 candidates there were 3,277 girls against 3,066 in 1882. 
From the ninth annual report of the Oxford and Cambridge schools examinations 
board for the year ending December 31, 1882, it appears that examinations had been 
held during the year under the authority of the board at 23 girls’ schools. 
At the first matriculation examination of the Royal University of Ireland, held De- 
cember 6, 1881, the number of women presented was 31, of whom 25 passed. At the 
second matriculation examination, October, 1882, 48 of the candidates were women; 
of. these 44 passed. 
The roll of students in Girton College in 1882 numbered 68. The number of stu-

dents who have been in residence in the college since its commencement is 137. Of 
these, 62 hie obtained honors according to the Cambridge University standard (22 
in classics, 17 in mathematics, 1 in mathematics and moral science, 10 in natural 
science, 7 in moral science, 4 in history, 1 in theology) and 20 have passed examina- 
tions qualifying for the ordinary B. a. degree. 
The College of Preceptors is the oldest board for the examination of middle class 
schools and pupils in England. Its operations are very extensive, the number of 
schools which from time to time make use of the examinations being 2,400. From 
the report of the examinations of this board for the half year ending Christmas, 1882, 
it appears that out of a total of 8,125 candidates examined 4,750 were girls; of the 
84 candidates who presented themselves at the examination of teachers for the col- 
lege diploma, 40 were women. The following statement is from the dean’s report for 
the year ending Christmas, 1883 :

The examination of teachers for the college diplomas took place on the 1st of Jan- 
uary and four following days, and was attended by 91 candidates, of whom 40 were 
men and 51 women. The subjects of examination included the theory and practice of 
education, scripture history, English language, English history, geography, Latin, 
Greek, French, German, arithmetic, algebra, Euclid, trigonometry, analytical geom- 
etry, natural philosophy, experimental physics, animal physiology, chemistry, draw- 
ing, and music. 
The Continent. 
The following information is derived from the inaugural addresses for 1882 and 1883 
of M. L, Trasenster, rector of the university at Liége, and from other documents in 
the files of this Office: . 
In Austria-Hungary the entrance of women in the university courses, which was 
permitted for a while, has been forbidden. Now the education of women is limited to 
that obtained in the common and burgher schools, in normal courses, and in the 
weibliche Arbeitschule. In the last, instruction is given in female handiwork in 
general, in making clothes, machine sewing, straw work, and hat making. 
Germany.— Women have never been admitted to the Prussian universities. At Leip- 
zig a few women followed the courses between 1871 and 1880 and two or three passed 
the examinations; but the authorities of Saxony soon forbade their admission. In 
Munich scientific courses were inaugurated in connection with the Academy of Sci- 
ences in the year 1878. Many secondary schools for young girls are reported. 
In Belgium the question of admitting women to the universities Was first brought 
up in 1875, by a dispatch from M. Delcour, minister of the interigy, to the different 
universities of that country, in which he asked for the opinion of the various facul- 
ties as to the admission of women. Liége and Ghent saw no special reasons for ex- 
cluding them, but the latter felt inclined to await the result of the trial in other coun- 
ties. In 1881 the University,of Brussels admitted women, and 3 women followed the 
course in natural sciences. In 1882~83 there were 7 in attendance: 5 in natural 
sciences, 1 in pharmacy, and 1in philosophy. Five registered themselves for the ex- 
aminations: 3 in sciences, 1 in pharmacy, and 1 in medicine. At Liége 6 women at- 
tended in 188283: 4in pharmacy, leach in medicine and natural sciences. Onthe 20th 
of October, 1883, there were 17 students (women) in the sciences ; thatis, in medicine, 
pharmacy, and natural sciences. One room is specially reserved to be used for study 
and recitation by the female pupils during the hours between recitations. One woman 
has already passed through a 2-year course and received the highest honors in phar- 
macy. Ghent had 1 woman in the course in natural sciences in 1882~83, Alawof the

  CXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
15th of June, 1881, stipulated for the establishment of at least 50 secondary schools for 
girlsand for normal courses as preparatory to the position of directress.or ggent. The 
examinations of those profiting by these courses and intending to he teachers were 
extremely successful. Women have pursued higher branches before the professors 
of the athenwums at Brussels and Liége. Language, literature, history, and math- 
ematics seem to be the subjects of attraction. The courses in the normals cover morals, 
psychology, pedagogy, methods, the history of pedagogy, the mother tongue (with 
its literature and history), either French, Flemish, or German (according to locality), 
Belgian history, geography and cosmography, elementary mathematics, elements of 
natural sciences, hygiene, some knowledge of arboriculture, agriculture, and horticult- 
ure in the normals for males and domestic economy in the course for women, penman- 
ship and book-keeping, elements of constitutional, administrative, and commercial 
Jaw and of social economy, drawing, vocal music, gymnastics, elements of the Ger- 
man or English language (with the object of interesting pupils to still farther pursue 
these branches after leaving the normals), industrial training for men and needle- 
work and cutting and fitting for women. 
In France a law of December 21, 1830, provided for the establishing of institutions 
for the secondary education of girls. The course of instructionis similar to that given 
above for Belgium. (See Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1881, p. cexlvi). 
A law of July 26,1881, provided for a normal school to furnish female professors for 
the secondary grades. The Société pour Venseiguement professionnel des femmes 
reports as follows for 1883: There are 535 pupils distributed among 4 schools under 
charge of this society in Paris. In addition to the general courses the majority of 
these girls pursue either business courses, drawing and design, cutting and fitting, or 
the courses in which drawing is applied to some industrial occupation. Pupils are 
fitted to be teachers and’ have been very successful in their examinatious for pro- 
fessorships in drawing in the lycées for girls and in the common schools, Sixteen 
were admitted to the exhibition of fine arts. Eight passed for the above professor- 
ships. The administration of the Academy of Fine Arts has created a diploma of 
superior grade for drawing (brevet supérieur de lVenseignement du dessin) and 
the necessary courses leading to such diploma have just been organized. In two 
schools free coursesin English are given. Arithmetic and accounts, chemistry, hygiene, 
and botany are also taught in these professional schools. Women are admitted to 
the courses in the different faculties of the University of France, but it is only in 
Paris that they carry on the complete courses, The Faculty of Medicine in Paris 
numbered 50 lady students in 1882-83. Since 1860, at which date women were first ad- 
mitted, the medical faculty has conferred 22 diplomas of M, D, on women and 1 as health 
officer, The faculties of science and literature have given to women 49 diplomas of 
B.L., 33 of B.s., 2 a8 lieentiaie in literature, and 29 diplomas (brevets de capacité) for 
special secondary instruction. The question of the education of women is still being 
agitated in the assembly and in the newspapers, and many young girls come forward 
to the examinations who do not look forward to making any use as teachers of the 
knowledge acquired. 
In Italy the higher education of women dates centuries ba . The University of 
Padua is prond of the names of Cornaro Piscopia and Novella @’Andréa. The Uni- 
versity of Bologna had Clotilde Tambroni as professor of Greek literature up to 1817. 
A regulation of the 11th of October, 1875, authorized the admission of women into 
the universities, providing they had obtained the lyceum certificate exacted from men 
who graduate from those schools. As there are few establishments for girls leading 
to such an examination, the numbers entering the universities are limited. In 1882-83, 
there was 1 lady student at the University of Turin, 1 at Pavia, 3 at Padua, 4 at Rome, 
and probably the same at Bologna. The following diplomas have been conferred 
upon women: Doctor of medicine at Turin, Pisa, and Bologna; doctor of laws at Turin 
and Bologna; doctor of philosophy and letters at Turin, Padua, and Bologna, and 3 
doctorates of natural science at Rome. In Turin 3 girls are following the courses in 
the Lycée Cavour. These courses succeed to those of the gymnasia and include
-P-A-G-E-135

rhetoric and 2years in philosophy. Information obtained in the early part of 1883 
is to the effget that institutions for the higher education of women are to be organized 
and put under charge of tlie ministry of public instruction. They are to be placed on 
a similar footing to the universities. The three institutions for girls at present exist- 
ing in Turin have been found quite insufiicient, so that the officials have already 
been obliged to open advanced schools for such graduates of the elementary grades as 
desire to continue their studies. 
Switzerland outranks other continental countries in point of women students and the 
number of diplomas given. In 1882-83 there were 52 women at the university in 
Geneva, 36 at Berne; and 24 at Ziirich. Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Russia, Rou- 
mania, the United States of America (4 in medicine), and South America were rep- 
resented in the 24, 17 of whom were medical students, the others pursuing a philo- 
sophical course. Formerly many Russians were present, but their government has 
interfered to prevent such attendance, as too much liberty of action and too great polit- 
ical exaltation were found among such women. ‘The conditions of admission at Ziirich 
are quite severe, as the student who desires to pursue the regular course must have 
attended a high grade of school and must have sufiicient knowledge of mathematics, 
natural sciences, and three languages (German being one, Latin and French or Italiaw 
and English the others) to be able to take up the proper studies. Most of the 
women students in the universities either go as ‘‘ hearers” or intend to obtain asbac- 
calaureate. The doctors’ diplomas given to women up to the present day are 41 for 
medicine at Berne, 25 at Ziirich, and 1 at Geneva (where the medical faculty has been 
but lately established ; for philosophy (PH. D.), 4 diplomas at Berne and 7 at Ziirich; for 
law, 1 at Berne. Women frequently obtain the highest points at the examinations. 
At Geneva the two upper classes in the highest secondary school for young girls, cor- 
responding to the philosophy classes in the French lycées, had 147 pupils in 1882, 
Spain formerly admitted women to some of the universities, but this is now pro- 
hibited. By decree of May 17, 1882, the authorities added a fourth year to the course of 
the Central Normal School for Female Teachers, and several decrees were promul- 
gated in 1882 in regard to the primary instruction of girls. 
In Portugal the subject is being canvassed. The rector of the university at 
Coimbra has been charged by the government to present the basis of a university re- 
form which will allow the admission of women. Two women, authorized by royal 
decree, have passed the examination for pharmacist, one in 1860 the other in 1872, 
but without having followed university courses. 
The Netherlands report 14 higher burgher schools for girls in 188182, with 1,089 
pupils in attendance. The instruction in the secondary schools for girls covers religion, 
arithmetic, natural sciences, mathematics, chemistry, botany, zodlogy, science of gov- 
ernment, geography, history, Dutch, French, English, German, book-keeping, needle- 
work, drawing, wsthetics, and psychology. 
The secretary of the senate of the University of Leyden writes to this Office that 
there are no enactments to prevent women from attending university lectures or tak- 
ing degrees the same as male students in that university or in any other university 
in the Kingdom. The director of the University of Ghent writes that a young woman 
passed the first examination in natural science last July. During the present aca- 
demic year the faculty of science has 5 young women students: 1 in natural science, 
first examination; 1 in natural science, second examination; 2 in pharmacy; and 1 
applied for the degree of doctor of sciences. The secretary of the senate of the Uni- 
versity of Groningen writes that this year the names ef 16 women are upon the rolls 
of the university. Of the number, 6 were admitted to the faculty of letters, 9 to the 
faculty of mathematics and physics, and 1 to the faculty of medicine. In 1882~83 
there were 18 women studying at the University of Amsterdam, 11 at Groningen, 4 at 
Leyden, and 7 at Utrecht. 
In 1878 women commenced to study in the ‘ hoogescholen,” and the first to enter 
Leyden were in 1882. Most of the students follow the courses in modern languages in 
order to geta “diploma of capacity” as teachers in secondary schools, At Amsterdam 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
CXXXVI_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
15 out of 18 were classed as follows: 1 in psychology, 1 in French literature, 1 in Eng- 
lish literature, 1 in Greek art, 5 in geography, 2 in the Gothic tongue, 2 ig old Dutch, 
and 2in botany. One woman student in medicine is mentioned at Utrecht, 1 at Am- 
sterdam, 1 in mathematical sciences and physics at Amsterdam, and 6 in natural 
sciences at Groningen. This last university gave one woman a diploma in pharmacy 
in 1878 and a medical diploma to another in 1879. 
Denmark reported 6 women entering the university at Copenhagen in 1883. 
Norway.— The Norwegian’ University at Christiania has allowed women to attend 
its lectures for two years past, and it has now obtained the right from the Odel- 
things to place women students on the same footing with men as far as examina- 
tions and scholarships are concerned. 
Sweden has between 60 and 70 girls’ high schools, in which are taught religion, the 
Swedish, French, German, and English languages, geography, history, mathematics, 
the natural sciences, calligraphy, drawing, fancy work, singing, and gymnastics. 
Studies of an advanced nature have already been added to this curriculum in order 
to meet the needs of adult young women. Normal courses are also reported, and a 
woman has lately received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Upsala University. A 
royal decree of June 3, 1870, opened the career of medicine to women, and the Caro- 
linian Institute in Stockholm has a special course in anatomy for them. Other 
courses are taken up at the University of Upsala. After passing the requisite exam- 
inations in medicine the women are allowed to practise. At Stockholm the Wallin 
School and the lycée for girls have a section leading to a kind of baccalaureate de- 
gree, the same studies being taken up as in the lyceums for boys. Fifty young 
women have passed this examination since 1870, Some continued their studies at the 
university, others became teachers. 
Finland had one woman in the philosophical course of the university at Helsingfors 
in 188182, 
In Russia women are excluded from. university courses, but at St. Petersburg, in 
addition to the school of medicine, there is a very prosperous institution where young 
girls take up higher courses in literature and the sciences. This establishment was 
organized in 1878, and at a later date (probably in 1881-82) there were 938 pupils re- 
ported. The course covers four years, and in 1882 there were 163 pupils ready to re- 
ceive diplomas: 99 in the literary department, 64 in that of sciences. In 1870 a spe- 
cial course for women was opened at the medical academy. This course was osten- 
sibly for midwifery, but really gave an extended knowledge of medicine. A four- 
year course could be attended by those who had followed the regular lyceum course 
prior to coming up for examination. Later, another year was added to the course. 
During seven years 959 women came up for examinations and 718 were received. Po- 
litical reasons caused the cessation of the course, but students were allowed to finish 
their studies, although no more were to be admitted. 
Tn Roumania 4 women are studying at the university in Bucharest; they are scat- 
tered through the departments: 1 in philosophy, 1 in philology, and 2 in medicine. 
Servia reports a school for the higher education of young girls, with 250 pupils. 
There is a pedagogical section attached to this school.

It is difficult to make such a presentation of the progress and condition of college 
education as the importance of the subject demands, because few of the institutions 
make any descriptive reports. Accounts of the tentative measures of the leading 
universities are in some cases published annually. Most colleges report only as they

  CXLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
are connected with some benevolent or educational society, or-are a part of the State 
system of education, or have been through some unusual experience. An instance of 
the first kind is afforded by the institutions connected with the American College and 
Education Society. It aids and makes a report of one college in each of nearly all 
thé Western States: Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Ne- 
braska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington Territory. 
The State systems of education usually include a university, and as it isa public 
institution a report to the legislature or to the chief executive is made of its condi- 
tion andneeds. The governor’s messages frequently commend the State university to 
the people and urge them to give it a generous support. Hon. Edward A. O’Neal, 
governor of Alabama, said last year: ‘‘'The university was founded by our fathers, 
the first great statesmen of Alabama, and it has been a source of blessing to the young 
men of the State since its organization.” Governor Pitkin, of Colorado, says of the 
State University: ‘I believe the president and faculty give to the institution not only 
large abilities but great enthusiasm, and that the character of the educational work 
is such as to commend it to the confidence of the people of the State.” Governors 
Jackson of West Virginia, Jarvis of North Carolina, and Nance of Nebraska report 
the universities of their respective States as increasing in usefulness and prosperity. 
Governor Hugh S. Thompson, of South Carolina, speaks of the State college in the fol- 
lowing terms: ‘ i 
Results have proven the wisdom of the policy which guided the cauncils of the 
college in the past, fhe earnest purpose tosend forth thorough scholars: men fitted by 
severest classical discipline to lead the senate, the pulpit, and the bar. Let this still 
be the policy of the college, but let it also aspire to do something more, to hold a fore- 
most place in the march of scientific discovery, and to send forth young men 
equally as well fitted by thorough technical training to lead in the development of 
the resources of the State: its fields, mines, and quarries, its railroads and water 
power, its manufactures and commerce, 
Examples of the kindly mention of colleges and universities by public officers might 
be indefinitely multiplied, but enough has been quoted to show the prevailing senti- 
ment toward institutions providing for a liberal education. 
Among the current events of note are the organization of the University of Texas 
and the destruction of the buildings of Iowa College by a cyclone. 
The act for establishing a university in Texas was approved March, 1881, anda 
board of regents soon afterward appointed. Buildings are in process of erection, 
afaculty has been selected, and ‘the university will be opened on the 15th of September, 
1883, for the reception and instruction of students.” The intention and spirit of its 
regents are expressed by their president, Hon. Ashbel Smith, as follows: 
The means to carry their will into effect lie idle in the treasury, and their use for 
this noble purpose will not add one cent to the public taxes. The people will take no 
educational starveling, no institution big in name but meagre in performance. They 
demand a university to be now organized in a manner and on a basis soon to be de- 
veloped into an institution on the high level of the foremost institutions of knowledge 
in the entire world; a university whose instruction, absolutely free, shall offer to 
every child in the State, poor or rich, that knowledge which is power to the individ- 
ual and, in the aggregate, power inherent and indefeasible to the magnificent im- 
perial State of Texas. 
e Iowa College, Grinnell, Iowa, was swept into ruins by a tornado on the 17th of 
June, 1882. The pecuniary loss was estimated at $81,645. The efforts of the officers 
to put the institution into shape for resuming work in the fall were successful, the 
college finding many friends in the time of its necessity. Its needs are yet unsup- 
plied in many particulars, notwithstanding the noble efforts of its students, officers, 
alumni, and friends. 
  Among the questions which have been under discussion during the year have been 
admission requirements, elective studies, athletic sports, graduate studies and degrees, 
and the selection of professors. 
ADMISSION TO COLLEGE. 
The movements modifying the conditions of admission to colleges and universities 
have consisted in more frequently receiving on probation graduates of high schools
-P-A-G-E-143

and academies upon the strength of their diplomas, the holding of entrance e¥amina- 
tions at different centres of population, and attempts of associated colleges to adopt 
uniform requirements of admission. An account of a movement of this kind is given 
by President Eliot, of Harvard College, as follows : : 
As the result of several debates and conferences within the past two years consid- 
erable changes have been made in the statements of the requisitions for admission to 
the following colleges: Harvard, Yale, Brown University, Dartmouth, Williams, 
Trinity, Amherst, Wesleyan University, Tufts, and Boston University. The object in 
view was to make the requisitions of these different institutions the same, on paper 
at least, for all common subjects ; and this object has been measurably accomplished, 
80 that the work of a school which is required to prepare boys in the same classes for 
several of these colleges has been much facilitated. The same quantities of the same 
authors in Greek, Latin, and English, the same topics in arithmetic, the same amounts 
of algebra and geometry, and the same descriptions of what is required as to reading 
Greek and Latin at sight will be found in the official statements of the requisitions 
for admission at all the abovementioned institutions, with some exceptions in the 
single case of Yale College. At several of the colleges, however, there is an older and 
perhaps easier set of admission requisitions which is maintained as an alternative. 
Some of these colleges, moreover, require candidates to offer subjects which are not 
demanded at.the others; and no attempt has been made to bring all the colleges even 
approximately to the same standard in conducting examinations on the same paper 
requisitions, In spite, however, of all the diversities which remain, the degree of uni- 
formity which has been secured by the negotiations of the past two years is a gain for 
the secondary schools, and, therefore, for the colleges as a whole. 
The ‘‘Assogiation of the Colleges of Ohio,” an organization formed about twenty 
years ago to improve the standard of the colleges in the State, is at present com- 
posed of the following institutions: Ohio University, Athens; Western Reserve Uni- 
versity, Cleveland; Kenyon College, Gambier ; Denison University, Granville; Mari- 
etta College, Marietta; Ohio Western University, Delaware; St. Xavier’s College, 
Cincinnati; Wittenberg College, Springfield; Otterbein University, Westerville; 
Oberlin College, Oberlin; Antioch College, Yellow Springs; Baldwin University, 
Berea; University of Wooster, Wooster; Hiram College, Hiram; Ohio State Uni- 
versity, Columbus; Buchtel College, Akron; and the University of Cincinnati, Cin- 
cinnati. . 
STUDIES. 
Eleotives.—Arguments for and against elective studies have been presented, as in 
former years. Those for electives are now being drawn from experience, while oppo- 
nents of the system defend their position by reasoning and pregedent. The appa- 
rently gratifying results of the system were stated at considerable length in my las¢ 
annual report. The objections were presented strongly by Hon. M. E. Gates, in his 
inaugural at Rutgers College, June, 1882. The following sentences are taken from 
this address: 
Experience has proved that in developing mental power certain studies have a far 
greater effect than do others. Herbert Spencer holds, in his treatise on education, 
that the knowledge which is of most practical value is uniformly pleasantest in the 
act of acquiring and gives the student most mental power in the gaining. The judg- 
ment of the ages and of the wisest men of this age is against his view, and analogy 
is not for it. 
There is another equally serious objection to this system. It makes an appeal to 
that natural love of doing the easiest thing which is subversive of all self discipline, 
of that mastery of the inclinations which all sound methods of education foster. 
‘“‘No way has been found of making heroism easy, even for the scholar,” says Emer- 
son. ‘The most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do 
the thing you have to do when it ought to be done, whether you like to do it or not.” 
This is a sound maxim of Huxley’s, and strikes at the central idea of electives. A 
system of education which substitutes for all’the disciplinary work of the college 
course a seductive and discursive field of elective studies, where a youth at eighteen 
is told to wander, selecting at his own sweet will, with a view to “unfolding his own 
individualities to the full in all directions,” I submit, is utterly subversive of all self 
discipline, and will not develop manly fibre, or give tone and symmetry to intellect 
or character. : 
One of the institutions which have recently introduced a partially elective system is 
Dartmouth College, A fixed number of recitations is required each week; a part of 
them may be chosen by the student after the second year. The required recitations
-P-A-G-E-144
CXLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
diminish in number in the senior year, that the student may take optional studies. 
Such an arrangement, with opportunity at the outset of choosing a particular course, 
gives a wide latitude of choice to the student. 
Honor studies.—A system of honor studies, adopted by the University of Rochester, 
is described in the annual report of the regents of the University of the State of New 
York as follows : 
In the University of Rochester a system has been for some time in operation by 
which young men of more than average ability, found in every class, may have the 
Shporeay to pursue, under the care of a professor, studies in advance of their class. 
ese are termed honor studies, and at the commencement those of the several classes 
who have successfully completed the work undertaken receive appropriate recogni- 
tion. Only those who give undoubted evidence of being able to accomplish more 
than the regular work of the class are permitted to enter upon these honor studies. 
In this way, without interfering with the general curriculum for the class, which 
must be based on average ability, its best members are afforded an opportunity to 
pursue in a systematic way the higher studies for which they have a special aptitude. 
A successful experience of several years has proved, what is of great importance, that 
os Acystema is perfectly practicable for a small college, with a small but scholarly 
‘faculty. 
Original research.— Original research is becoming more recognized as a part of col- 
lege work. The following extended notice is taken from the notes to a paper read by 
Prof. J. H. Wright, of Dartmouth College, before the National Educational Associa- 
tion: 
Information as to original work done at Johns Hopkins by the students (mostly, 
however, post-graduate) is given in the University Circulars and is summarized in the 
Annual Register. Professor Gildersleeve’s Greek seminary probably approaches the 
best German ideals more nearly than any other American institution of the kind in 
the range, method, and quality of work done in and throughit. The Latin semi- 
nary under Professor Warren well maintains the high standard set by its director and 
by the university. Professor Sylvester’s mathematical seminary is without doubt 
unsurpassed in the world. 
At Harvard there is much activity in this direction. Mr. George Bendelari, lately 
an instructor, writes: 
“In history, certain of the courses are in original work. The original work is 
of two kinds: First. The men select a subject for a thesis, and are then turned 
loose into the library among the original authorities, so that the results, although 
they may not be new, are certainly original so far as the work of the student is 
concerned. Second. The history of England, for example, is worked up without 
a text book, the men using only the original authorities, under the guidance of the 
instructor. The best work, of course, is done by men who are candidates for honors ; 
but there are plenty of others in the courses. In mathematics and physics work of 
this sort islikewise done ; part of it consists in finding known results by new methods, 
part in obtaining absolutely new results. Some of the work in physics appears in the 
Journal of Physics, the results of original experiments by undergraduate students. 
In natural history the same is true; the results appear in the bulletins of the Agassiz 
Museum and in those of the Boston Natural History Society, * * * I know that 
considerable work of this kind is dene in classical philology. * * * In some of 
the German and French courses in modern languages these are required. Iam inclined 
to think, however, that they are mainly in the nature of literary criticisms or of com- 
pilations. In Middle High German and Gothic, original work was done; for in- 
stance, on the grammar of particular authors and works. In my old French course 
theses were required, and if they were mainly compilations the fault lay chiefly with 
the scarcity of material in the library. The effort was constantly made to obtain 
original individual work from the student. In all these cases, so far as the under- 
graduates are concerned, I doubt whethex the results are ever very startling. Asa 
means of preparing men for work after they leave college, however, and of teaching 
them to think for themselves, not to trust blindly to books, and not to be too much 
frightened, I consider it the very best work done in college.” 
ith regard to Yale College, Prof. T. D. Seymour writes: ‘‘Professors Packard 
and Peck assign special investigations to their graduate students, but do not find the 
undergraduates soready asthey would desire for such work. * * * Occasionally astu- 
dent is ready to undertake an independent investigation. He is always (supposing 
his fitness for the work) encouraged and aided. In other departments the optional 
work of the last two years is largely independent. In metaphysics, for example, each 
student looks up the system of some philosopher, which he is to study and criticise in 
all its relations. His thesis on this subject takes the place of anexamination. * * * 
Mr. Packard tries the seminary work occasionally.”

    SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. XLV 
Political science.—The study of political science has recently been attempted to an 
enlarged extent. The school established for this purpose in Columbia College has 
commanded a fair attendance, so as to “justify the belief that the power of the school 
for good is justly appreciated by the public.” The School of Political Science estab- 
lished in 1881 at the University of Michigan has been attended by interested classes, 
and there seems to be no obstacle to its successful careér. At Cornell University a 
course in history and political science was opened at the beginning of the last college 
year. A full professorship of American history has been established. The purpose 
of the course is stated by President A. D. White as follows: 
The purpose of the new department of history and political science, [again remind 
you, is to send a considerable body of young men out into the world fitted to discuss 
political and social questions thoroughly and intelligently. All tendency to party 
views, as such, has been and will be carefully avoided. Though it is clear that men, 
whether educated or not, will continue to view political and social questions to a con- 
siderable extent from party standpoints, we may fairly hope that a beginning has been 
made here and elsewhere in fitting men to discuss the main questions involving our 
social and political well-being with a large knowledge of their historical development 
and of the best ascertained bases for healthful action. 
ATHLETICS, 
The subject of college sports has attracted much attention recently. It includes 
questions whose discussion cannot be outlined on a single page and which require 
a multitude of facts on which to base correct conclusions. It is my purpose to have 
these facts collected and prepared for the public. Doubtless all college authorities 
haye opinions on the profitableness and on the dangers of boating, ball playing, and 
similar sports. The action of the Harvard authorities is stated as follows: 
Since the beginning of the current year the standing committee of the faculty have 
made regulations which forbid college clubs to play or compete with professional 
clubs, and provide that, after the current year, no student shall belong to a boat crew 
unless he can swim and that no student shall engage in any athletic contest until he 
has been examined and pronounced fit by the director of the gymnasium. The com- 
mittee have also denied to professional ‘‘ trainers” access to the grounds and build- 
ings of the university, except by special permission of the committee. The influence 
of the committee has been successfully used to reduce the number of match games of 
ball and to confine them to Saturdays. These various restrictive measures have, on 
the whole, commended themselves to the judgment of the whole body of students 
and graduates; for even the young men most active in athletic sports had perceived 
that the college competitions were running to excess, and that the ball games, boat 
races, and some of the sports technically called athletic were in danger of losing that 
amateur quality which should always characterize the bodily exercises and sports of 
young men who are in training for intellectual pursuits and for modes of life in which 
satisfaction and power of usefulness come, not from great muscular strength or 
special skill in any sport or exercise, but rather from a well proportioned bodily de- 
velopment and good general health. When games are made a business they lose a 
large part of their charm; and college sports cannot approach the professional stand- 
ard of excellence without claiming the almost exclusive attention of the players and 
becoming too severe, monotonous, and exacting to be thoroughly enjoyable. The 
most devoted college athletes have repeatedly rebelled against what they thought too 
strict or too prolonged training. Moreover, a high standard of excellence tends to 
make the number of persons who actually take part in athletic sports very small, the 
considerable number of tolerably good players being driven from the field and re- 
duced to the unprofitable position of mere lookers-on. 
GRADUATE STUDIES AND DEGREES. 
The custom of granting degrees without examination or the pursuit of a course of 
study is gradually being discontinued. The master’s degree is earned in many insti- 
tutions by the completion of a required amount of study. The regulations of the 
time and place of study are not alike in the different institutions. Some require 
merely the passing of an examination and set no limits as to the time and place 
of doing the work. For example, the Illinois Wesleyan University offers courses of 
study to non-resident students, upon the completion of which such degrees as.bache- 
lor of philosophy, doctor of philosophy, and master of arts are conferred. Exami- 
x
-P-A-G-E-146
CXLVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
nations are held semiannually by persons accessible to the student and acceptable to 
the university. The examination papers are furnished by the university. The Uni- 
versity of Michigan offers its graduates a similar privilege, but the examination must 
not oecur until more than two years after graduation. A second class of institutions 
are those that do not so much require time as the completion of a certain class or group 
of studies and attendance at the institution during study. The University of Vir- 
ginia gives the master’s degree to those who complete the courses of eight of its 
separate schools —Latin, Greek, French and German, pure mathematics, natural phi- 
losophy, general chemistry, moral philosophy, and historical science—and who 
have been subjected in the last year of their candidacy to a special examination in 
any two schools of their own selection in which they have graduated in a previous 
year. A third class of institutions fix the minimum limit to the time of study and re- 
quire the accomplishment of a course of study prescribed by the faculty or by certain 
of its members. The earned degree of master of arts in Columbia College is given 
after a year’s study and an approved examination upon one at least of five specified 
groups of studies. Lehigh University requires either one year’s study at the uni- 
versity or two years’ study elsewhere. The preparation of essays is frequently required 
in connection with the examinations. 
PROFESSORS. 
The selection and qualifications of college professors have called out some com- 
ments in recent reports. President Andrew D. White, of Cornell University, says: 
In calling professors it is not always advisable to select the men whose reputation 
is already made and who have passed the active part of their lives. A certain num- 
ber of such are indeed useful, but the main strength of the faculty must always re- 
side in younger men who have their reputation to make and who can make it. With 
care, discretion, and fair treatment of our instructing body we shall at no distant 
day realize the most ardent hopes of our friends as regards our faculty ; but it can- 
not be done in a single day or in a single year, nor. can it be done by indiscretion of 
any sort; it demands thoughtful study of needs and of men, weighing of testimony, 
a wide look over the whole field concerned, and great judgment in making selec- 
tions. 
President D. C. Gilman, of Johns Hopkins University, says: 
The disciplinary method of a college calls for men of high social, mental, moral, 
and religious character, for they are to be concerned in moulding the dispositions of 
young men and in forming their habits at a critical period of life, when the parent 
begins to relax his authority and the youth has not learned to govern himself. It re- 
quires as professors those who were born to be teachers, who delight to act upon 
youthful minds, to inspire them with lofty motives, to train them by the best meth- 
ods, to emancipate them from the slavery of sloth, to set before them noble examples, 
to cherish their faith. The lessons to be inculeated during a college course include 
obedience to recognized authority, the performance of appointed tasks, punctuality 
in meeting all engagements, and attention to physical development. ‘To acquire 
knowledge, to master the arts of clear reasoning and fit expression, to test the capac- 
ity for different kinds of intellectual exertion, to develop a desire to master difficul- 
ties, and to form intellectual friendships and associations are among the ends to be 
sought in college life. :

cL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Continued interest in industrial and scientific education is shown by largely in- 
creased attendance at schools of this class, by the extension of*their facilities for in- 
struction, and by opinions expressed in public and in private gatherings, in personal 
letters, and in printed documents. The progress of technical education in this coun- 
try is looked upon with surprise by foreign educators and manufacturers. Our own 
people are alive to the necessity of cultivating the arts of peace and are inquiring for 
methods of education directly preparatory to the common industries. Men, eminent 
as leaders in technical education, are studying the schools of Europe and introducing 
valuable features from them into our American schools. Amoig those who have re- 
cently undertaken this work or are now engaged in the examination of foreign meth- 
ods are Prof, J. M. Ordway, a. M., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; C. 
O. Thompson, PH. D., president of Rose Polytechnic Institute, and H. T. Fuller, a. M., 
president of the Worcester Free Institute. Such results are expected of our technical 
institutions as Hon, R. W. Thompson, formerly Secretary of the Navy, attributes to 
those in France. He recently said : 
They have enabled her engineers to occupy positions in the front rank among the 
most distinguished in the world. These, by thorough explorations, have succeeded 
in mapping ont with great particularity all her material and natural resources. By 
this means and by the scientific classification of her soils and her mineral and vege- 
table products, she has been enabled to understand the nature and extent of her own 
resources and to shape her policy and industries so as to develop them to the utmost. 
Her wonderful success in this is seen in the facts that wealth and the means of sub- 
sistence are more equally distributed in France than in any other European state, 
and that almost every foot of earth is made to contribute to the prosperity of a peo- 
ple to whom emigration is not necessary, as in neighboring nations, in order to better 
their material condition. & 
     
PREPARATION FOR INDUSTRIAL ARTS, 
Two circulars of information were issued by this Office in 1882 in response to this 
popular feeling and demand. One prepared by Charles G. Leland, esq., of Philadel- 
phia, discussed the subject of industrial art in schools from a practical standpoint. 
The experience of the author enabled him to speak clearly on the topics presented 
and to engage the attention of readers to an unusual extent. About 50,000 copies 
have been distributed to correspondents and applicants and have produced inarked 
results. The cireular has been reviewed and warmly commended by educators in 
foreign countries. 
The other circular relating to industrial education was the preliminary report of a 
commission appointed by Queen Victoria to inquire into the instruction of the indus- 
trial classes of certain foreign countries in technical and other branches, and the in- 
fluence of the instruction on industrial pursuits. The first report of the commission 
was on manual and technical instruction in France, with a description of the system 
of elementary instruction in that country. A representative of the commission, Mr. 
William Mather, visited this country for the purpose of examining our methods of 
technical instruction and the institutions in which this department of education is 
prominent. He observed faithfully and obtained much correct and valuable knowl- 
edge of our technical and industrial schools for the use of the commission in preparing 
a final report. His report comes to hand as this is going through the press and it 
  
1Karl Wemer, government inspector of schools at Salzburg, presented a review of Mr. Leland’s cir- 
cular and an outline of industrial efforts in European schools in the Literarische Beilage der Montags 
Revue, Vienna, April 25, 1883. He introduces in the beginning of his article the following sentences : 
While peaple were contented at an earlier period with giving in schools only such branches of knowl- 
edge as might form the basis of a more extended culture, the requirements of life demanded practical 
training for the people, and industrial education. The child should, in addition to reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, also learn those things which exercise a determining influence on life, and ‘knowledge de- 
rived from natural seience, geography, and history should give the future citizen broader views to 
qualify him the better to fulfil his mission. : e 
Bat the teachers did not rest here. It was desired to introduce work itself to the school, and this is 
what is treated of in a pamphlet by Charles Godfrey Leland, director of an industrial school in Phila- 
delphia, who seems to have practically solved a problem for which Europe is yet hardly prepared.

TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. — cLI 
ably presents the conclusions and facts obtained during his tour of five months, I 
take from it some opinions and expressions that will be read with great interest: 
The preéminence of the Americans in many branches of mechanical industry ren- 
ders it necessary to give a general view of the character and scope of the education 
in the public schools as well as to discover what provision has been and is being made 
for technical and industrial training. The provision made for science teaching in 
the many universities and colleges not directly technical in their character, in the 
various States, has also required my attention for the reason that a large proportion 
of the graduates of these institutions pass at once into the industrial arts after leay- 
ing college. 
In America, where all institutions aye founded by the people for the people, there 
is not a school or college in which may not be found the sons and daughters of the 
working classes. Not unfrequently have I found young workingmen spending a year 
at college in scientific studies, who intend to restime their manual employment after 
leaving it. * * * 
Disappearance of apprenticeship.— The old system of apprenticeship has almost ceased 
to in America, * * * The,whole tendency is to engage boys as they do men, 
only for what they are worth. The-evil of this will be severely felt in the future, if 
not mitigated by great changes in education, for the reason that many boys are 
obliged to leave school at 14 or 15, and if they are not allowed to enter the skilled 
trades they will be thrown upon casual employments or unskilled pursuits for tem- 
porary gain anda livelihood. Thus amass of incompetent and unskilled laborers would 
row up, incapable of going out West, and would become a drug upon the labor mar- 
ket inthe East. It is undoubtedly a shortsighted policy on the part of employers to 
discourage the employment of boys without aiding those movements which, in the 
form of industrial schools, would enable a boy to qualify for service at 17 years old at 
a higher rate of wages than he could probably get at that age but for this training. * >    
The existence and Hg cee of technical institutions.—There exists in America a certain 
number of high clas®institutions for technical and scientific training in mining, and 
civil and mechanical engineering. I am of opinion that in these branches, judging 
from my own observation, there is nothing better of the kind, though such institu- 
tions are more numerous at present, in Europe. The advantage of the training in the 
best of them is its practicalness. Tho students fee] that careers are open to them if 
only they have acquired the art of applying their knowledge; hence their ambition 
is excited andevery one of them appears to be working for adefinite purpose. * * * 
The act of Congress in conservating forever a large portion of the territorial wealth 
of the nation for the purposes of industrial and scientific education is a sagacious 
scheme of statesmanship. There is provided in every State at least one centre from 
which all the knowledge necessafy to instruct the youth of the State in scientific in- 
dustry may radiate. That many of these colleges have drifted from the original in- 
tention of the authors of the act is only a temporary evil. The tide has set in the 
other direction now, and the marked success of those colleges, such as in New York 
State, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Massachusetts, é&c., in the direction of technical 
instruction, is premosily leading to the conversion of all. * * * 
It is probable that within a short time all these institutions will become the great 
technical schools of the country, while still retaining facilities for general literary 
education, * * * 
To make the best use of a given quantity of material requires a sound knowledge of 
its properties and of its disposal in the arts and manufactures by scientific methods. 
In this direction the technical and science schools already instituted have accom- 
plished much in providing foremen and managers, chemists, miners, and intelligent employers in the engineering and manufacturing industries. * * * 
Graduates.— Many hundreds of young men have been furnished from these sources for the superintendence of railway works, mining operations, machine shops, and the 
textile industries, besides chemical works, glass manufactories, building operations, agriculture, &e. I have met in almost ail the manufactories I have visited —from niving, iron and steel manufacturing, through all the mechanic arts up to watch 
making and sewing machine manufacturing — evidences of the influence of the tech- 
nical schools. . 
‘The graduates of the varions technical schools are in good repute among the iron- masters, and employment is readily offered to those who have studied chemical and 
metallurgical science. 
Deficiencies in technical education.—It is remarkable that in the great centres of the mining and iron producing districts, where also a large amount of mechanical con- 
etruction is carried on, as, for instance, in Pittsburgh, Pa., Chicago, Ill, Detroit, 
Mich., Cleveland, Ohio, and Philadelphia, Pa., so little has been done by the 
owners of large establishments or by the town or State authorities in the direction of 
technical schools or eyening science schools. These industries represent a large pro-

portion of the wor! 
have to rely upon 
mote from these districts. * 
Thaye not met with any institutions for technical training having any bearing upon 
the textile industries, The knowledge of chemistry acquired at the various institu- 
tions which I have described is of course utilized more or less in dyeing, printing, and 
bleaching; but there are no schools in which the knowledge of the nature and qualities 
of fibres and of the various processes in working up the raw material—silk, cotton, 
or flax—are taught. In all the manufactures into which taste and design enter the 
Americans have to,rely almost entirely upon European aid. * * * 
Possible results of industrial training.—If industrial training, however, is adopted 
throughout the country, the capital and labor of the future will find profitable em- 
ployment without protection in the vast regions now opened up by the railways in 
all directions, The true source of wealth, in the resources of nature, may be drawn 
upon to supply all the comforts and necessaries of life at greatly reduced prices, so 
that the purchasing power of wages will be increased. When America abandons the 
shadow for the substance, her national wealth and prosperity must be augmented, 
while her industries will develop upon the solid and sure foundation of freedom in 
trade as in political institutions. It is to meet her under such conditions in friendly 
rivalry and competition that we must prepare ourselves. 
A report on industrial education in the United States! was called for in December, 
1882, by the Senate. Its resolution was as follows: 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Interior is directed to furnish to the Senate 
the latest and fullest information in the possession of the Burean of Education in 
relation to technical or industrial education in the schools and colleges endowed in 
whole or in part by the Government of the United States, and also in other schools 
in the country reporting instruction in industry for either men or women. 
The resolution was immediately complied with, and a reportgmade of the objects, 
condition, and work of institutions endowed by the national Mind grant of 1862, of 
similar schools not so endowed, and of enterprises for the industrial education of 
women. Many of the institutions interested had furnished accounts of their condi- 
tion and work, and in some instances plates for the illustration of their facilities and 
methods of instruction, so that with the material in the Office it was possible to pre- 
sent a full survey of the field of industrial education. Some advances in this direc- 
tion have occurred since, and they form the principal part of the subject matter of 
the subsequent pages.

EDUCATION IN AGRICULTURE, 
Agricultural education has made perceptible advance during the time covered by my 
report. The industrial colleges of the South especially have been improving their 
courses of study in agriculture. Through the Northern States the number of students 
taking such courses is still small. Hon. George W. Atherton, a. M., president of the 
Pennsylvania State College, refers to the reason for this, in his report for 1882 to the 
board of trustees, as follows: 
So far as the almost uniform experience of this country goes, the market demand 
for highly educated scientific men is not so great in agriculture as in many other em- 
ployments. I say ‘‘market demand,” and mean that alone. Thereis no field of labor 
in which education and knowledge can be more usefully and productively applied 
than jn agriculture; and if young men starting in life had sufficient capital they 
would often prefer the life of the farm to any other occupation. But the present state 
of our industries is such that a young man whose only capital is a good education 
finds that he can use it with greater certainty of immediate returns in other pursuits 
rather than in farming. 
As a result of the increased interest in scientific agriculture and the disinclination 
of students to devote themselves to it, the establishment and conduct of experimental 
stations have been attempted in connection with severalinstitutions. Connecticut,New 
Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin are among the States which have provided for such stations. 
The one in Connecticut was established in 1877 and has been associated more or less inti- 
mately with the Sheffield Scientific School at New Haven. In 1882 the legislature au-

thorized the purchase of a lot and the erection of buildings for the station. This was 
done during the summer, and the work of the station was transferred to thenew quarters 
in September. Its investigations have hitherto been mostly in the field of chemistry. 
The station at Rutgers College, New Jersey, was established in 1880, and is distribut- 
ing the results of its investigations and experiments among the farmers of the State. 
The stations in Ohio and Wisconsin are more recent in their origin. The work of the 
former is classified under the four heads of grain raising, stock farming and dairy 
husbandry, fruit and vegetable culture, and forestry. Preparation is made for an- 
alyzing fertilizers, examining the quality of seeds, identifying weeds and other 
plants, investigating the habits of insects, and making other inquiries of a similar 
nature. The Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station proposes to investigate ques- 
tions of special interest to the farmers of the State in such a manner as to make the 
results of general value. ‘‘ Its sole purpose is the discovery of new truths and laws 
which may be of benefit to agriculture.” 
The experiments in practical agriculture on the farms of agricultural colleges have 
been conducted with much profit and are being more frequently undertaken. Those 
mentioned in my last report as going on at the Houghton farm, Orange County, New 
York, have been continued, and instruction is being given in connection with them. 
Mr. Henry E. Alvord, the director, writes the following: 
One feature of Houghton farm not shown by our pamphlets is that we keep three 
or four young men constantly with us as farm pupils, receiving practical instruction, 
on a scientitic basis, to fit them for conducting farms of their own or managing the 
estates of others. We have had pupils from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, 
Virginia, North Car@ina, Wisconsin, England, Island of Jersey, Germany, and Japan. 
The courses of study in the State Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama 
have recently been remodelled, in order that they may include more branches imme- 
diately connected with the industries of the State. A special professor of agriculture 
has been added to the faculty and the State agricultural experiment station has been 
established at the college. The legislature has made appropriations for improving 
the farm and supplying apparatus and books, A short course in agriculture has 
been established for young men who cannot afford the time and expense necessary 
for the completion of the regular course of four years. An agricultural museum con- 
tains nearly 700 specimens, illustrating varieties of soils and products, and a museum 
of mechanic arts has been commenced. E 
The Missouri Agricultural and Mechanical College is being conducted with renewed 
vigor by Prof. J. W. Sanborn, B. 8., who was recently called from the New Hampshire 
College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. Professor Sanborn has added to the 
announcement for the coming year some general remarks of interest. Of the progress 
of agricultural investigation he gives the following outline: v4, 
In 1804 the King of Prussia put Von Thaer in charge of the estate of micogeliy, of 
1,200 acres, where the science and art of agriculture were taught. In 1806 Fellenberg 
founded a school of agriculture in Switzerland that trained 3,000 students, while 
France devoted the royal palace at Grignon to agriculture. It was not, however, un- 
til the three grand characters, Liebig, Boussingault, and Laws, came almost simul- 
taneously into the field, about 1840, that agricultural investigation took on its 
present broad proportions. Liebig’s masterly genius opened up a wide field for in- 
vestigation, while the latter two gentlemen had both the genius and the talent for 
research. The former (Boussingault) has devoted a lifetime to farm research on his 
estate at Bechelbron, France, while the latter (Laws) has devoted his English estate 
to the cause of definite agricultural knowledge, Chemists, botanists, field hands, are 
in his constant employ in a work that began in 1840 and involves an annual outlay of 
$15,000, and $500,000 are devoted by him to its continuance. In 1852 the first public 
experiment station was founded at Leipzig, and this work, inaugurated by the Ger- 
mans, has extended until the world boasts of nearly 150 stations, employing from 
2 to 5 scientific men each constantly. To these workers must be added hundreds of 
investigators connected with agricultural colleges or carrying on private inquiry. 
Professor Sanborn speaks of the functions of agricultural colleges as follows: 
To familiarize the student with the science of farming is not the only function of 
an agricultural college. When properly managed, each operation of husbandry is  
-P-A-G-E-154
CLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
taught by field work from hot-house propagation through planting, budding, prune 
ing, and the general management of horticultural products. Upon the farm proper, 
laying out and construction of drains, selection, management, and breeding of animals, 
grading of wool, rotations, tillage operations, and crop growth are taught by practice, 
and every attempt made to tix the habit of observation. Regular labor on the farm 
serves to retain a taste for farming, especially as it is used to illustrate some princi- 
ple or law involved. The intellect being called in play, farm work is divested of its 
monotony and robbed of the repressive influence derived from it when viewed as mere 
physical labor. 
The Storrs Agricultural School, at Mansfield, Conn., owes its existence to a gift of 
a farm of 170 acres, with commodious school and farm buildings, by Mr. Augustus 
Storrs, and of $6,000 by Mr. Charles Storrs, of which $5,000 were for fitting the institu- 
tion for werk and $1,000 for drainage. These gifts were accepted by the’State and an 
institution was established for the instruction of boys in the State “in such branches 
of scientific knowledge as shall tend to increase their proficiency in the business of 
agriculture.” The full course of study requires two years of three terms each, the 
terms being twelve weeks in length. Students receive instruction both in the class 
room and on the farm. In the class room they study those branches of natural science 
which have a directly useful bearing on New England farming, such as general and 
agricultural chemistry, natural philosophy, farm mechanics, surveying, botany, zodl- 
ogy, geology, animal physiology, mineralogy, and theoretical agriculture, stock-breed- 
ing, and composition. The general principles of these sciences are taken up first, and 
afterward their special applications to practical agriculture. Elementary English 
studies, simple carpentry, and agricultural practice are also taught. This last sub- 
ject includes the improvement of the soil by tillage, drainage, qaanuring, and irriga- 
tion; the culture and handling of the various field, garden, and orchard crops of New 
England—grass, grain, roots, vegetables, and fruits—from planting to market; the 
use, care, and repair of farming tools, implements, and machines; the. breeding, rear- 
ing, training, feeding, and use of live stock; the best methods of dairying; the busi- 
ness and management of the farm in all its details; keeping accounts, inventory, 
capital, labor, rotation of crops, and systems of farming adapted to various circum- 
stances, and the history of foreign agricultural methods. 
The Hampton (Va.) Normal and Agricultural Institute is the leading institution in 
which the industrial education of the colored race is undertaken. It adopts a course 
of instruction in mechanics less expensive and more productive than those of most 
northern and western institutions. It has extensive farms on which produce for the 
school and for the markets is raised by the help of student labor. During the last year 
133 young men were employed in farming. The mechanical department of the insti- 
tute affords instruction and practice to colored and Indian apprentices in carpentry, 
wheelwrighting, blacksmithing, tinning, painting and glazing, shoemaking, and har- 
ness-making ; and to colored students in the operations of a knitting factory, in 
sawing and wood working in the Huntington Industrial Works, and in printing. The 
Huntington Industrial Works are employed in manufacturing lumber, mouldings, 
windows, door frames, and other building material. ‘Twoperiodicals are issued from 
the printing office and much miscellaneous work is done. The young women of the 
institute find employment in sewing, tailoring, and making shirts. The amount earned 
at Hampton by the students in 1882~83 was $35,288.93. Student labor is estimated 
to be 25 per cent. more expensive than common labor; but the value of training the 
hand, of industrious habits, and self reliance and the effect of labor on character are 
such as to justify the present system. Yet the mechanical department is considered 
the most difficult problem of Hampton Institute. The employment and paying of 
skilled foremen and mechanics, the purchase of material, the prevention of waste in 
its manufacture by apprentices, and the sale of products require persons of the high- 
est business qualifications. A recent examining committee, consisting of Rey. M. E. 
Strieby, D. D., and J. M. Ward, of New York, Mr. George A. Walton and Mrs. E.N, L. 
Walton, of West Newton, Mass., and Henry W. Foote, of Boston, reported that in the 
very limited time at their disposal enough “was seen to show that manual labor, as

ameans of mental and physical training, is an essential. * * The students make 
long days, but with the varied employments little fatigue is experienced and good. 
health is the rule, Thus, in addition to the knowledge and discipline received in the 
school proper, every student leaves the institution with the ability tosupport himself 
by some useful employment.” 
PROGRESS OF INSTRUCTION IN PRACTICAL MECHANICS. 
A course in shop practice was introduced into the Colorado Agricultural College in 
1882. Students give to it two hours a week during the winter terms of their prepara- 
_ tory, freshman, and sophomore years and the same amount of time during the entire 
senior year* The kinds of work undertaken and the time assigned to each were as 
follows : Bench work in wood, 12 weeks; machine work in wood, 4 weeks; pattern 
making and foundry work, 12 weeks; vise work in iron, 10 weeks; iron forging, 14 
weeks; steel forging, 4 weeks; and machine work in iron, 20 weeks. The mechanic 
shop consists of a main building 25 by 56 feet and two stories in height, with a one- 
story wing 20 by 62 feet for the forge shop and its accessories. The whole is fitted up 
with an engine, wood and iron working machinery, and the proper tools and benches 
for work by hand on iron and wood, including wood carving. It is intended that 
this department of practical mechanics shall give ‘‘ a systematic and progressive edu- 
cation in the use of tools and materials, combined with as much theoretical knowl- 
edge as shall be deemed necessary to properly explain the principles involved.” 
A report in regard to the better development of the mechanical department of the 
Illinois Industrial University was made to the trustees in March, 1882, by the regent, 
Selim H. Peabody, pH. p., who is himself professor of mechanical engineering and 
physics. It contains a concise statement of the condition of that department and 
the lines along which its extension seems most desirable. He considers the province 
of the shop to be, like that of the laboratories, to give instruction, but finds it difficult 
to arrange the time of shop work so that the students may gain the maximum ben- 
efit from it without interfering with other studies and exercises. The class of be- 
ginners in’ the machine shop numbered 17 at the time of the report. The limited 
supply of tools and the distribution of room necessitated an illogical and inconven- 
ient arrangement of work. The equipment consisted of 6 sets of bench tools in 
the pattern shops, 8 vises and accessories at the iron-workers’ benches, 3 fires and 
anvils in the blacksmith shop, and 8 machine tools in the machine shop. Dr. Pea- 
body recommended, in addition to these, a supply of elementary tools: 9 sets of car- 
penters’ bench tools, for the pattern shop; 7 vises, with hammers, files, &c., for the 
machine shop; small lathes for wood turning; and small engine lathes, for the machine 
shop. The trustees approved of the recommendations and the department of me- 
chanics is much aided by the provision for its wants. 
Purdue University, Indiana, has been advancing its department of practical me- 
chanics and perfecting its course in shop work. The important appliances added to 
the shop in 1880~81 ‘were 5 sets of carpenters’ tools, 4 wood-turning lathes, and a 
scroll saw ; in 1881~82, 1 small machine lathe, 1 speed lathe, 3 iron-working vises 
with tools for them, 3 sets of carpenters’ tools, and a circular sawing machine; in the 
summer of 1882, a large machine lathe, a set of standard gauges, and miscellaneous 
tools. Three classes of students are instructed: regular, agricultural, and special. 
The agricultural students take an abbreviated course, occupying one houra day during 
the middle term of two years. Special students enter the shops with the view of taking 
some one or more selected branches. A number of young ladies have been among the 
special students, and ‘“‘they have done the same work as the young men, and, though 
progressing much slower, have been nearly as successful.” The special work of the 
department is separated into three distinct divisions: the ‘‘supplementary course of 
instruction,” consisting of recitations and lectures ; class work in the shops; and work 
in the shops outside of classes. The supplementary course of instruction oceupies 
an hour daily for three terms and includes the presentation and discussion of working

drawings and a consideration of the uses and operations of tools and machines. 
All necessary directions are given and explanations made in regard to shop work. 
The shop exercises require two hours daily throughout the first two years of the col- 
lege course, and the elementary principles of construction are involved in the opera~ 
tions performed. The students receive compensation for work done outside the regu- 
Jar class hours. The quality of this work has been good, and the remuneration for it 
has aided in the payment of the expenses necessarily incurred during a college course, 
At Cornell University, the, Sibley College of Mechanic Arts has received substan- 
tial additions to its equipment. A foundery recently provided is being used in train- 
ing men in the practical duties of the master mechanic and mechanical engineer. A 
large collection of models to illustrate mechanical construction, prepared under the. 
eye of Professor Reuleaux, director of the Imperial School of Arts and Manufactures 
at Berlin, enables the professors to illustrate every important form of machine connec- 
tion and mechanical movement; and many combinations and contrivances which 
would be only imperfectly understood by the most complete drawings are shown 
clearly by these models. Specimens of American tools and machinery are being col- 
lected with a view to setting before students examples of excellent workmanship. 
The method of instruction adopted is a combination of the constructive and the Rus- 
sian systems. The graduates of the college are sending in*gratifying reports, and 
President White, commenting on their success, says: ‘‘ We shall see more and more 
of such results ; more and more the State and the nation will have cause to thank the 
benefactor who has provided so liberally for the application of science to the great 
mechanical industries of our country.” 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas is making commendable efforts 
to improve its department of mechanics, in which one-half of its students are re- 
quired to be instructed. Six hours of shop practice a week are required, with three 
hours of mechanical drawing. Students are taught the use and care of tools and the 
kinds of work for which each is intended, They apply their knowledge in a regular 
course of exercises and in the construction of articles for practical use and the repair 
of buildings. The faculty have recommended that $4,500 for buildings and $2,800 for 
equipment be applied to the mechanical department out of a recent legislative ap- 
propriation, 
MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
Manual training schools have been established in connection with the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology at Boston and Washington University at St. Louis. 
The establishment of a school of this kind is being discussed earnestly in Baltimore 
by members of the city school board and others and is urged by leading daily papers. 
In Chicago an association has been incorporated for the purpose of providing a manual 
training school in that city. The object of the school is stated in the articles of in- 
corporation to be— 
instruction and practice in the use of tools, with such instruction as may be deemed 
necessary in mathematics, drawing, and the English branches of a high school course. 
The tool instruction as at present contemplated shall include carpentery, wood turn- 
ing, pattern making, iron chipping and filing, forge work, brazing and soldering, the 
use of machine shop tools, and such other instruction of a similar character as it may 
be deemed advisable to add to the foregoing from time to time, it being the intention 
to divide the working hours of the students as nearly as possible equally between 
manual and mental exercises. 
A fund of $100,000 has been secured, a suitable lot of land purchased, an architect 
engaged to complete plans for buildings, and a director chosen. The board of trustees, 
with Hon. E. W. Blatchford as its president, is such a body of men as will not allow 
any failure in the enterprise committed to their care. 
The success of the School of Mechanic Arts of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology and of the Manual Training School of Washington University has been 
marked, and is becoming more evident as operations and results of the schools are

better known. Testimonies to their efficiency and value are given by those who 
have been in a position to observe their methods and work. Three quotations with 
regard to the St. Louis Manual Training School are given below, the first from Gov- 
ernor T. T. Crittenden, of Missouri; the second from Prof. C. M. Woodward, dixector 
of the school; and the third from Hon. William G, Eliot, p.p., chancellor of Wash- 
* ington University. Governor Crittenden says: 
The old system of apprenticeship is aboutat an end, and it is necessary, if we pro- 
pose to protect the interests of our industries and consult the welfare of our youth, 
to devise some means for their proper training. In our ordinary and more advanced 
schools the only vocations aimed at and in which positive interest is aroused are 
commerce, buying and selling, banking, reckoning accounts, keeping books, and the 
so-called ‘learned professions.” The ordinary school boy gets the idea that it re- 
quires no education to be a mechanic; hence he aspires to what is called a higher 
profession, a higher avocation, and foolishly learns, from vicious sources, to despise 
both craft and craftsman.“ If this pernicious tendency can be corrected and the 
dignity of skilled labor and skilled workmen be maintained by the introduction of 
manual training into grammar schools of high grade, great good will be accomplished. 
Ihave no hesitancy in directing attention to this cena school as one of our edu- 
cational ornaments, worthy of the patronage of our sons and the respect of our 
citizens, 
Professor Woodward says: 
The zeal and enthusiasm of the students have been developed to a most gratifying 
extent, extending into all the departments of work. The variety afforded by the 
daily program has had tbe moral and intellectual effect expected, and an unusual 
degree of sober earnestness has been shown. The wholesome moral effect of a course 
of training which interests and stimulates the ardor of the student is most marked. 
Parents observe the beneficial influence of occupation. The suggestions of the day 
fill the mind with healthy thoughts and appetites during the leisure hours. Success 
in drawing or shop work has often had the effect of arousing the ambition in mathe- 
matics ad history, and vice versa. 
The following is from Chancellor Eliot: 
One other feature of our young institution (and thus fav, as I believe, peculiar to 
it as a university) must be dwelt upon with emphasis, though very briefly. It is the 
- manual training school, which now has a hundred student workmen busily engaged 
in acquiring the elements of a sound mental education at the same time with practi- 
cal training in the use of tools, to fit them for intelligent application of skilled labor 
in whatever direction the growing industries of manufactories and workshops may 
require. Old-time educators doubtless smile at the idea of a university saddling 
itself with a workshop as altogether beneath its dignity, but we think it high time 
for the clear recognition of the equal dignity of skilled industries with the so-called 
professional pursuits. Let education go into the workshops and it will so dignify 
them. The educated mechanic is the peer of the statesman, and from the union of 
his pend and hand work comes a large part of the civilizing agencies of the nineteenth 
century. 
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. 
A course in electrical engineering is to be offered by Cornell University at the be- 
ginning of the next college year and one was established last year at the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology. This movement is in response to “a real demand 
for men educated to take part in the great interprises called into being by the develop- 
ment and application of electrical energy.” ‘The course in the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology is an alternative course in physics, differing from the one previously 
existing chiefly in the continued study of electricity, instead of a pursuit of other 
branches of physics, and in the introduction, in place of chemical analysis, of a con- 
siderable amount of practice in mechanical engineering in the laboratory and the 
workshops. It is intended to impart a knowledge of the theory of elecricity suffi- 
ciently extensive to prepare for ordinary electrical work and advanced study. In- 
struction will be given in the various methods of electrical testing, and particularly 
with regard to land and submarine telegraphy, the telephone, electric lighting, the 
electrical transmission of power, and acoustics as involved in telephony. The study 
of electricity is being given special and increased attention in several other scientific 
institutions. :

  CLVUI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
A NEW POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
A technical school of a high order was opened at Terre Haute, Ind., in March, It 
received its generous endowment from Mr. Chauncey Rose, and was named in his 
honor the Rose Polytechnic Institute. The steps taken preparatory to opening the 
institute were stated by the secretary of the board of managers, Samuel S. Early, a. M., ~ 
and I insert from his paper the paragraphs relating to the proceedings immediately 
prior to the organization of the school: 
Finding themselves, by the receipt of the specific legacy, possessed of funds which 
yielded an income of about $25,000, the managers felt that the time had come when 
they might take the necessary measures for opening the institute. Their first im- 
portant step was the election of Dr, Charles O. Thompson, of Worcester, Mass., to 
the presidency of the faculty. This occurred on the 20th of February, 1882, and the 
president of the board, with the secretary and General Charles Croft, visited Worcester 
for a personal conference with Dr. Thompson. Toward the end of March he accepted 
the appointment, and immediately began the work of selecting a faculty and prepar- 
ing a detailed plan for the organization of the school. Professors of chemistry, of 
elementary and the higher mathematics, and of drawing and the superintendent of 
the machine shops were chosen and accepted. Those whose services were necessary 
reported for duty as soon as their prior engagements admitted, and by the end of 
the summer of 1882 great progress had been made in the work of preparation, It was 
found that a small class could be provided for by the beginning of March, 1883, and 
in August of 1882 circulars were published inviting applications for admission. 
An opportunity for the purchase of the apparatus and library of the late Dr. John 
Bacon, of Harvard College, was availed of by the board, and a most admirable col- 
lection of instruments and ofscientific books was added to the resources of the school. 
Power, machinery, and tools for the shop were purchased by Mr. Edward S, Cobb, 
the superintendent, under the sanction of a committee composed of Messrs. Peddle, 
Nippert, and Cox; cases for the mineralogical specimens were constructed after the 
plans of Prof. Charles A. Colton, of the department of chemistry, and the elegant collec- 
tion was mounted, labelled, and stored under his skilled labors. Shelving for the 
library, designed by Prof. Clarence A. Waldo, the future librarian, was provided, and. 
the early purchases of the board and the Bacon library were catalogued by the secre- 
tary and arranged by members of the faculty, Large additions to the library and 
apparatus were made by President Thompson, who had sailed for Europe, in July of 
1882, for study of the methods and progress of technological instruction in the more 
advanced schools abroad, Tables, easels, models, in briet, all the required appliances 
for the department of drawing were procured upon the suggestions of Prof. William 
L, Ames, of that department, and by the time anticipated everything was in readi- 
ness for the opening. On the 6th of March candidates for admission were examined, 
and a class of twenty-five members selected from the most proficient. 
The condition of the school is shown by the following clauses from a preliminary 
announcement by the president, Charles O. Thompson, PH. D.: 
In accordance with the directions of the founder, the institute offers a good educa- 
tion based on the mathematics, physical sciences, living languages, and drawing, and 
familiarity with some form of applied science or of handicraft. The course of study 
is so planned that every student spends a fixed portion of his time in learning the ele- 
ments of the business or profession that he designs to pursue after graduating ; this 
part of his work is called practice. 
Recitations, lectures, laboratory work, and drawing are of uniform kind and amount 
for all students ; exercises in practice are widely different, depending upon the de- 
partment selected by the student. The general course of study does not differ essen- 
tially from that pursued in other polytechnic schools. The practice is offered in the 
following departments: Mechanics, civil engineering, chemistry, physics, drawing, 
and design. The choice of a department is made by each student soon after entering, 
under the advice of the faculty. A department of mining engineering will be or- 
ganized as soon as possible, and duly announced. 
In the shop is an assemblage of rooms in which iron and wood working tools and 
machinery, arranged with reference to instruction by means of construction, are pro- 
vided for the use of the students. The wood-room, boiler andengine rooms, are in 
order ; the iron-room and forge shop will be in order before September 1, 1883, as all the 
requisite tools are now under contract ; so that students in mechanics will enjoy the 
advantage of practising in a large, well lighted, manufacturing machine shop, which 
is equipped with the best modern tools and machinery,

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION-——SCHOOLS OF THEOLOGY. CLIX 
INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The accomplishment of the industrial education of a nation can only result from 
a system of instruction begun in the elementary schools and carried up to the most ad- 
vanced institutions. Prof. Robert H. Thurston, a. M., ©, E., of Stevens Institute 
of Technology, Hoboken, N. J., has prepared an outline of the requirements of such 
a system, which shows how much remains to be accomplished in this country for 
technical education. He says: 
Such a plan to be satisfactorily complete must comprehend — 
(1) A common school system of general education which shall give all young children 
tuition in the three studies which are the foundation of all education, and which 
shall be administered under compulsory law, as now generally adopted by the best 
educated nations and states on both sides the Atlantic. 
(2) Asystem of special adaptation of this primary instruction to the needs of children 
who are to become skilled artisans or who are to. become unskilled laborers in de- 
partments which offer opportunities for their advancement when their intelligence 
and skill prove their fitness for such promotion to the position of skilled artisans. 
Such a system would lead to the adoption of reading, writing, and spelling books ij 
which the terms peculiar to the trades, the methods of operation, and the technics oi 
the industrial arts should be given prominence, to the exclusion, if necessary, of 
words, phrases, and reading matter of less essential importance to them, 
(3) A system of trade schools,in which general and special instruction should be given 
to pupils preparing to enter the several leading industries, and in which the princi- 
ples underlying each industry, as well as the actual and essential manipulations, 
should be illustrated and taught by practical exercises until the pupil is given a good 
knowledge of them and more skill in conducting them. This series should include 
schools of carpentry, stone cutting, blacksmithing, machine work, &c., weaving 
schools, schools of bleaching and dyeing, schools of agriculture, &c. 
(4) At least one polytechnic school in every State in the Union, in which the sciences 
should be taught and their applications in the arts indicated ‘and illustrated by 
laboratory work. In this school the aim should be to give a certain number of stu- 
dents a thoroughly scientific education and training, preparing them to make use of 
all new discoveries and inventions in science and art, and thus to keep themselves in 
the front rank.

  REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
° 
The course and progress of medical education since the date of my last report, like 
many other objects of human effort, are partly cheering and partly depressing. If, 
indeed, welook too long at the temporary hindrances in the way of many laudable 
endeavors we are apt to become discouraged; yet the point that we have reached 
already is the net result of many past advances and retrogressions, nor is there any 
worthy end to which we may not hope in time to attain by wisdom, perseverance, and 
courage. The history of medicine in this country when written will exhibit many 
illustrations of this truth; one of these, for the comfort of desponding medical edu- 
cators, is here mentioned. In our day, when medical men endeavor so scrupulously 
to conform to the requirements of medical associations and to the dicta of professional 
“codes of ethics,” the condition of affairs sixty-five years ago, as described by the 
venerable Dr. J. L. Atlee in a recent address, seems barbarous: 
In my day, previous to the establishment of medical societies throughout the coun- 
try and the organization of the American Medical Association and the general adep- 
tion of the code of ethics, I saw many disastrous effects from the want of brotherly 
consideration and kindness. The medical men of that day were often in difficulties ; 
patients would be taken from one physician to another without ceremony; and so 
great was the jealousy existing between [physicians] that for more than twenty years 
after my graduation it was impossible to form a medical society in my native city and 
county [Philadelphia], because there were so many aspirants for the honors. Here 
let me speak of some of the difficulties I had to encounter in my early professional 
life. Instead of being taken in hand by the older physicians, every obstacle was thrown 
in my path: consultations were refused and the treatment of my patients unfavorably 
criticised. By the establishment of medical societies and the adoption of the code of 
ethics a wonderful change has been effected.   
The future of medical education will show an improvement as great as the past has 
shown in medical ethics and demeanor. The necessity and the advisability of educa- 
tional reforms must be argued patiently and their personal advantage manifested 
without possibility of error; the more widely these efforts are made the more surely 
and speedily the incredulous and the indifferent will be convinced. Reform in med-

  CLXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ical education can be attained only by compliance with the laws of human nature; in 
this as in every other subject of public interest the minority before prevailing must 
become the majority. 
When analyzed from the stunding point of historical development, all the current 
questions relating to medical education may be grouped under four general heals: 
(1) those relating to qualifications for the study of medicine; (2) those respecting 
the quantity and method of medical instruction ; (3) those respecting the licensing 
of practitioners; and (4) those respecting the number, government, and support of 
medical schools. 
CONDITION IN COLONIAL TIMES. 
During the colonial period of our history medical education received only the seant 
attention that might be expected from a people of vigorous physique, occupied in 
clearing and settling an enormous territory and free from most of the diseases that 
afflict humanity of lower vitality and under less favorable conditions. The thinly 
settled coast between the Kennebec and the Savannah Rivers contained, in 1776, 
about 3,000,000 inhabitants, for whose medical service there were about 3,000 prac- 
titioners. Perhaps 500 of these were in possession of a medical or surgical degree. 
There were exactly 51 graduates from the two medical schools then existing in the 
country; the others were graduates or licentiates of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, London, 
Leyden, Paris, or Padua. Persons desiring before 1765 to study medicine were forced, 
in most cases, to content themselves with the instruction of a “ preceptor ;” few were 
able to incur the expense of a long absence in Europe. It is obvious that the stand- 
ard of medical education as it is understood now was not high; yet the absence of 
medical schools, societies, dissections, and text books was replaced by an abundance 
of practical instruction : indentures usually ran for five or six years; students prepared 
the forms of medicine now common in apothecaries’ shops and. compounded their pre- 
ceptors’ prescriptions; they were obliged to bleed, cup, pull teeth, ress wounds, 
spread poultices, gather herbs, and perform a great part of the work now divided be- 
tween the physician, the druggist, and the nurse; they visited invalids in company 
with their preceptors and often treated cases under their supervision. Yet more than 
this, they were often obliged to become fluent Latinists, because text books, lectures, 
and students’ notes were chiefly in that language as late as 1750; thus it happened that 
young men often studied the classics at the same time that they studied medicine, or 
were pretty thoroughly trained to read and speak Latin before they began their pro- 
fessional studies. The early colonial physician often combined other functions with 
those of healing: sometimes he was a minister of the gospel, sometimes a farmer, a 
shopkeeper, or a mechanic ; indeed, he may have combined all these duties, While 
the progress of events has endowed the American rural and village practitioners with 
somewhat better chances for medical training, it is still true that many of them are 
farmers or druggists. The less wealthy, less populous, and less educated parts of the 
nation still abound in medical men who have never entered the doors of a medical 
school or at the most have contented themselves with one course of lectures. 
The early conditions of American life also fostered two other habits in the public 
mind, which have resulted in serious evils: private persons recommend favorite rem- 
edies or nostrums to their friends and “ patent medicines” are bought and swallowed in 
reckless profusion. The mortality resulting from the first mentioned habit probably does 
notexeeed some hundreds annually, butthe fatal results of the other propensity number 
thousands every year. When the number of professed and responsible medical prac- 
titioners was smalland their general qualifications were low, such practices were 
excusable and in many cases unavoidable, but at the present time this guerrilla mode 
of fighting disease with weapons of unknown range and missiles of secret composition 
should be.diseouraged by enlightened public sentiment. 
ESTABLISHMENT AND GROWTH OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
The lack of proper facilities for medical education in early times at last-encouraged 
the establishment of medical schools in the colonies: one was opened in Philadelphia
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  MEDICAL EDUCATION. CLxvit 
in 1765, now called the medical department of the University of Pennsylyania; another, 
in connection with King’s (now Columbia) College in New York, in 1768. The reyo- 
lutionary war suspended both these enterprises.. There were four other schools begun 
before 1800. Of the six, only the University of Pennsylvania and the medical schools 
connected with Harvard (1782) and Dartmouth (1796) Colleges now exist. The estab- 
lishment of schools has kept pace with the increase of population and the extension 
of the settled area of the Union; indeed, the increase of medical schools and medical 
men has been double that of the actual necessity. This is a great evil, but its causes 
run far back in our social development. 
Our earliest schools tried to preserve a distinction between the bachelor and the 
doctor of medicine ; circumstances induced them to abandon the effort, but the low- 
ering of purpose was significant of the social confusion and lowered moral tone that 
followed the revolutionary war. The newer colleges followed the older in failing to 
require any educational qualifications in their matriculates, and all followed Dr, Cul- 
Jen, of Edinburgh, in his innovation of lecturing in English instead of Latin. Neither 
social nor political ideas had so far advanced that either women or colored men sought 
to become physicians, Thus any white man who could pay the fees might attend 
medical colleges and, if he passed a rather easy examination, become a doctor of 
medicine. Yet the graduates were, as a rule, the best of the medical profession, the 
most enlightened, the most far-seeing, and asmall proportion of them were graduates 
of literary institutions, so that the upper grades of the profession still had a tincture 
of letters. But the bulk of the profession at the beginning of this century and for 
many years afterwards did not possess any medical degrees. 
The natural consequences of this irrational freedom after a time came to pass. Men 
of lively fancy, untrained reason, and natural boldness revolted against the frequent 
ignorance and numerous errors of physicians and became followers and advocates 
of special medical doctrines rather than students and practitioners of the medical art 
as a whole; thence arose the once widely known “botanic” school of practice, which 
has succeeded in impressing some of its ideas on the class of physicians who call them- 
selves ‘eclectic ;” from the same cause the novel doctrines of Hahnemann received 
their earliest couverts in this country; and the vagaries of hydropathy, physiop- 
athy, vitopathy, electropathy, and other ‘medical heresies” in later days derive 
much of their support from the sume cause. Simultaneously with the early rebel- 
lions against the pretensions of the regular medical profession “the New York Re- 
formed” Medical College was opened in 1826, ‘‘the Worthington Medical College” 
(1832), and ‘‘the Physio-Medical College” (1836) in Ohio, and other schools at Peters- 
burg, Va., Macon, Ga., and other places. Of course thisrevolt was seized by design- 
ingmen asa good opportunity for the furtherance of their own purposes, and “ diploma 
selling” in America began as early as 1433 under the auspices of a “ Christian Col- 
lege,” which was contained in the house and bounded by the person of a man named 
Bennett, who lived in New Albany, Ind., but sold his wares as far east as New York 
City.? 
After a while some women wished to study medicine. The idea was intensely un- 
pleasant to the profession, composed as it was entirely of men. If entrance to the 
medical schools had depended on some adequate previous training in letters the 
female aspirants for medical training might have been turned aside to make a pre- 
liminary attack on the schools and colleges of classical and literary character; but 
since sex had been the only qualification for admission conservators of the old order 
of things were put to great labor and plunged into vexatious and fruitless disquisi- 
tiotis about the natural unfitness of women for the healing art. This position, being 
false in fact and untenable in argument, failed, and the Woman’s Medical College of 
Pennsylvania was opened at Philadelphia in 1850; a homeopathic school for women 
was also begun at Boston in 1848,

CLAVIUT =RECoRT OF THE CUMMISS{ONER OF EDUCATION, 
Again, some colored people wished to study medicine, and colleges for their 
instruction in this subject began shortly after the late war. Even the dextrous 
John Buchanan, of diploma-selling fame, was attracted by the eagerness of some to 
practise medicine, and kindly organized his ‘Philadelphia University of Medicine 
. and Surgery,” wherein colored medical men were manufactured with great speed 
and in considerable numbers. Schools of a more reputable character and with 
intellectual and scholastic requirements quite up to the average of American med- 
ical schools have also been organized for them in Washington, D. C., Lincoln, Pa., 
and other places. 
The old qualification for becoming a physician having been thus gradually ren- 
dered inoperative, the history of medical education for the last fifteen years shows a 
very rapid increase in the number of medical schools and students, so that the Union 
has now more physicians in proportion to its population than any other part of the 
globe. So great, indeed, has the number of physicians become and so alarming is 
the annual increase that a very intelligent medical journal of recent date remarks 
as follows: 
The recurring commencements of medical schools have added their annual quota 
to the great army of medical men. Thongh a time worn and hackneyed topic, the 
Gazette cannot refrain from a repetition of some well known facts that these many 
graduates may have heard before, but which are perennially true and fresh, and will 
therefore bear repetition. 
These hundreds of medical men are coming into a profession which is greatly over- 
crowded. What knowledge or what talents have +hey which will fit them for the 
struggle before them? for to the majority of them it must be a struggle and to many 
necessarily an unsuccessful one. They will have to contend with those who have been 
specially favored by education, or ability, or opportunity, as well as with those whose 
only claim for the patronage of their fellows is unlimited self assurance. They must 
practice athong people who are becoming more and more intelligent as regards medi- 
cal knowledge, and must contend against widespread skepticism as to the value of 
medicine and the necessity for their existence as physicians. What are the qualities, 
what the accomplishments, which will enable them to rise superior to the flotsam and 
jetsam of scoffing criticism and to establish their right to be the advisers of their 
feflows on such supremely important questions as the physician is called upon to 
solve?! 
INADEQUATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PRACTISING MEDICINE, PAST AND PRESENT. 
In plain English, the time has now come (the profession being so crowded and the 
increase of candidates for employment being so much greater in proportion than the 
increase of population) when the medical student pays to the medical college money 
for which he receives no calculable equivalent ; he asks for bread and receives a stone. 
The really capable graduate is jostled, crowded, shouted down, and trampled upon 
by a horde of unwieldy behemoths, who not only intercept most of the work that he 
only is able to do satisfactorily, but who supplement their scant incomes by arts and 
devices that his nature and training forbid him to join in, Having overcrowded all 
other departments of medical employment, many of these physicians by the grace of 
a diploma have lately taken up the work of opening and conducting medical colleges, 
much to the wrath and confusion of the older schools who would dearly like toretain 
their monopoly of oversupplying the market with medical “spring chickens.” The 
position assumed by these older schools is exquisitely illogical: they do hot like to 
establish effectual entrance examinations (which might force some candidates to defer 
the study of anatomy and chemistry until they had mastered the simpler mysteries of 
reading and writing) because they do not want ‘‘to limit the number of doctors by 
artificial regulations.” This phrase, quoted from a recent address by a widely known 
and much respected medical teacher and author, teaches us that “artificial regula- 
tions” mean all rules or usages that may or can hinder any young white man from 
paying money twice over for the privilege of hearing the same course of lectures dur- 
jng two courses of instruction. The “regulations” that forbid the faculty from re- 
ceiving the money of a white woman or that of a black man, we learn by inference, are 
not ‘ artificial.”

MEDICAL EDUCATION. CLXIX 
This same medical professor and author says that ‘‘the law of supply and demand 
will properly control the professional expansion.” Assuming that this is true, let the 
same rule be applied to the schools that supply the human integers of ‘‘the profes- 
sional expansion:” the establishments that donot try ‘‘to limit the. number of 
dgctors” by long, complicated, and difficult courses of study obviously should become 
the most frequented and best attended, because the law of prompt and cheap supply 
- is as much an axiom as the one quoted by the learned professor and author. When, 
however, ‘‘ the law of supply and demand” is thus supplied, the professor expresses 
his disapproval of the result in the following words: 
Many of the new colleges which have sprung up so abundantly over the country 
have really no.right to exist. They are unprovided with the materials for teaching, 
and the fees are insufficient to procure them; they have no hospitals or dispensaries 
to which they can resort for clinical instruction ; the faculties are without reputation 
or experience ; the building in which the college has its habitat is some temporary 
structure little suited to the purpose. ‘The lectures are mere recitals of text hooks, 
which the student could better read for himself. * * * 
‘These medical schools get into such desperate pecuniary straits that they must em- 
ploy every possible expedient to obtain students. One hears of personal solicitations, 
of promises, of sending out drummers to intercept students on the trains and at hotels, 
of practiccs in short which seem to touch at the lowest point of degradation. The 
“advantages” of these institutions, besides their proximity to the homes of students, 
are the low fees, or no fees at all, how highsoever the nominal price, and the cer- 
tainty that a diploma may be obtained on a minimum of attendance on lectures. Such 
institutions are, indeed, little more than ‘diploma mills.” These medical shops hurt 
our position before the public immensely, They unite with the reputable medical 
schools to form a national association of medical colleges. After a time they put on 
a severely virtuous air and are disposed to snub newer colleges organizing in their 
vicinity, stigmatizing them as unnecessary, crude, and inferior. Having thus ac- 
quired a quasi-position and assuming a tone of lofty pretension, they carry on a 
traffic in medical diplomas the profits of which enable them to maintain a baleful 
existence. The most beneficent reform which can now be undertaken is to close the 
doors of these institutions engaged in flooding the country with unqualified doctors.’ 
Denunciations like the foregoing are of little value, for they accomplish nothing; 
when analyzed dispassionately they are reduced to complaints that newer competi- 
tors are underselling ‘the old and well known stands.” Of course the customers at 
the cheaper shops will get an article of inferior quality ; that also is a “law” of trade, 
Even if the respected professor could have his wish and he could “close the doors of 
these institutions engaged in flooding the country with unqualified doctors,” the evil, 
so injurious to the profession at large and to the guild of higher-priced medical col- 
leges in particular, would not be corrected. Ifthe cheaper schools are closed their 
clients ‘‘ will enter some diploma shop and secure such training as its meagre re- 
sources afford,” together with the coveted diploma. In this direction there is no 
hope of relief. Gazing on the prospect before him, the professor can well adopt 
Satan’s melancholy words: 
In the lowest deep. a lower deep, 
Still threatening to devour me, opens wide. 
Some medical schools and many medical educators have chosen a much better ex- 
pedient: they have-adopted a preliminary examination to test the would-be medi- 
cal student’s general intelligence and knowledge. I am sorry to say that in several 
cases this preliminary test is a “humbug,” but in most of the colleges that have 
adopted the expedient it has been applied in good faith. Into these schools a person 
styling himself in writing “a Nachural Practishuner”? can no longer enter for the 
purpose of being crammed with medical Jore. There is little doubt that, either by- 
general consent or the passing of State laws, it will not be many years before an 
entrance examination will be required of all persons desiring a medical training. 
Another antiquated and obsolescent practice in American medical education is also 
doomed to an early death; I mean the practice of requiring less than the usual exer-

tion in order to obtain a diploma from the man who, without previous lecture courses, 
has dared to trifle with the lives and health of his fellow creatures during some 
‘tyears of reputable practice,” so called. Formerly it was quite common to offer a 
inan of this kind a degree at the end of one course of lectures, while young men 
whose records and consciénees were entirely clear of professional manslaughter were 
obliged to pay for two courses, exactly like each other in subject, length, and cost. 
‘This practice of selling the same article twice is also falling into deserved disrepute, 
altbough still followed and defended by many flourishing medical schools and “ de- 
manded” by the large body of young men who always want to become physicians in 
the easiest way that is considered respectable. These clients crowd the amphithea- 
tres of the schools alluded to, well knowing that, if public sentiment were once 
thoroughly informed as to their unwritten bargain with the schools they attend, such 
haste and imperfect preparation for their solemn responsibilities would not long be 
tolerated in a civilized community. Does this language seem harsh and ill-natured ? 
Let me relieve its effect by quoting the following wise and witty remarks of Surgeon 
John §. Billings, u. 8. A., at a recent medical college commencement: 
Being unable, as I have just explained, to remember what was said to me by way 
of valedictory and never having been present at a similar ceremony from that day 
to this, I thought it would be prudent to consult the literature of the subject and find 
out what is usually said upon such occasions. For this purpose I have examined 
about a hundred valedictory addresses, and have obtained from them a vast amount 
of instruction and some little amusement. From them I gather that this is an epoch 
in your lives, that you are entering a remarkable ago of the world’s history (it is eus- 
tomary here to allude to steam and electricity), that you live in the most wonderful 
pektsteg under the sun, and that the eyes of the world are upon you. All are agreed 
upon these points, and also as to the importance and dignity of the science and art of 
medicine and the necessity of continued study on your part to keep pace with its ad- 
vanees. But the addresses are not equally harmonious on all points. Some of them 
assert that the condition of medical education in this country is not altogether satis!ac- 
tory; that there are some medical colleges (not, of course, the college of the graduates, 
but some other medical college) which might be spared; that there are too many doc- 
tors now and more coming, and that some of these not only have not as clear ideas 
about the precession of the equinoxes or the authorship of the book of Job as a mem- 
ber of one of the learned professions should have, but that there are eyen graduat:s 
in medicine (of other schools of course) to whom the addition of vulgar fractions is a 
stumbling block and correct spelling a vexation of spirit. On the other hand,I find 
some who assert, first, that the above statements are unfounded; second, that it is not 
necessary to know how to spell correctly in order to cure the chills or set a broken 
leg; and, third, that the demand for higher medical education is essentially a perni- 
cious, aristocratic movement, calculated to oppress the poor and prevent them from 
obtaining the sheepskins so desirable to cover their nakedness. As, however, Iam 
sure that all of you are just now strongly in favor of higher medical education (with- 
out regard to what you may have thought about it a few weeks ago, or what youmay 
think about it a few years hence, when you get a little steam hatching machine of 
your own), I feel that I shall most contribute to the harmony which this oceasion 
demands by —entirely agreeing with you.! 
NEED OF IMPROVED STANDARD IN MEDICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The more thoughtful and less self seeking members of the medical profession unite 
with Dr. Billings in his desire for a higher and better medical training than has 
hitherto been common in America. The venerable American Medical Association has, 
almost since its foundation, tried to produce a better condition of sentiment on this 
subject in the profession, and learned committees of its members have reported at 
different times important recommendations. My first annual report, fourteen years 
ago, contained an article on medical education as it. was and as its writer? thought it 
should be. Some of the recommendations in that paper have been almost literally 
carried out by the recent reforms instituted; others, which I believe to be as useful 
and indispensable to both public and professional wellbeing, are not accomplished yet, 
butsoon may be. The special form that reformed medical education should assume was

pointed out in that article and it was recommended that the lecture courses be 
graded and extended through three years, preceded by an entrance examination and 
terminated by an examination conducted under the auspices of the State. When that 
article was published only two medical colleges in the country provided a graded 
course of lectures occupying three winter sessions, the Chicago Medical College and 
the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary. Now, although the Chicago 
school has not yet made such a course compulsory, many others have done so under 
the leadership of the medical departments of Harvard University and the University 
of Pennsylvania. A 
Harvard for 187172 announced an extended and graded course of instruction. 
The University of Pennsylvania, laboring beside a formidable and vigorous rival 
school, was obliged to proceed more slowly: a university hespital was opened in 
1874; three professors of the medical faculty and three lecturers appointed by that 
faculty, together with five professors appointed by the trustees, became the teaching 
staff of the hospital. April 4, 1876, four of the hospital teaching corps became per- 
manent members of the medical faculty in the university. In 1877~78 a compulsory 
graded course of instruction comprised three lecture courses, each five months long. 
Early in 1878 a generous woman endowed the university chair of surgery with a gift 
of $50,000, and a like endowment of the other chairs in the medical faculty is pro- 
gressing, so that in time the pay of the faculty will not depend on the size of the 
attending class or the number graduated. The entrance examination, still of a 
rudimentary character, was instituted in 1881. The lecture term was lengthened from 
five to six months in 1882, and a further prolonging to seven months is announced 
for the session of 1883~84. Moreover a fourth year of Wore advanced study, recom- 
mended and advised, but not as yet required, has been arranged to begin at the same 
time. The graded scheme has thus been tried for six annual sessions, at which the 
attendance of students has varied from 378 to 363, with an average of 367.5 per 
session. The graduates from 1878 to 1883, six years, have been 670, an average of 
111.66 annually. For the six years before the adoption of the graded course the 
annual attendance was 388.33 and the average number of graduates was 108,33. 
Thus, while the university has substantially preserved its attendance, the quality, 
character, and attainments of the students have improved immensely. The longer 
time, more thorough teaching, harder work, and greater expense have attracted a 
better class of men while frightening the superficial, the lazy, the badly prepared, 
and the ‘‘crammers.” The advance in general intelligence and education is very 
manifest and the proportion of students possessing literary and scientific diplomas 
has doubled in six years. 
Harvard, as I have said, adopted an excellent scheme of three lecture courses prop- 
erly graded in 1871, and candidates for degrees were required to spend at least the 
last entire year under its instruction, besides passing the oral and written examina- 
tions in the studies of the two previous years, Of late, like the University of Penn- 
sylvania, a graded course-of four years has been provided and is strongly recommended. 
by the faculty, though it is not yet obligatory. Men graduating in three years at 
Harvard receive the degree of M.p.; those who study the fourth year and pass the 
examination with credit receive the degree cum laude and, on proper application to 
the university authorities, may also receive the degree of M. a. I have not space 
here even to mention the numerous other schools of medicine that have obligatory 
or alternate graded courses of instraction. 
The greatest security for the permanence of this improvement would be the endow- 
ment of the medical chairs with sums sufficiently large to afford, by investment, a 
decent income to the incumbents. I wovld not recommend paying an absolutely 
fixed sum per annum to university professors of any faculty, but would compensate 
them by a fixed minimum salary (which would prevent the professors’ minds from 
being harassed and weakened by financial worry) aud an additional amount, depend: 
ing on the number of students who should study in that faculty. The very great
-P-A-G-E-172
  CLXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
importance of endowing the medical chairs is well set forth by Dr. Oliver Wendell 
Holmes in the following remarks: 
Medical science is only a special province of biology, the science which deals with 
the laws of life. It borrows much from the other divisions of this great realm of 
knowledge. It levies contributions from other realms, from physics, from chemistry; 
it accepts a useful hint from whatever source it may come. A medical school has to 
teach much that is incidental to medical practice, but only in this way can it send 
forth fully equipped practitioners. It begins with chemistry, anatomy, physiology, 
and thus prepares its students for study at the bedside and in the operating room. 
All this takes time and the codperation of different experts, each of whom shonld be 
a master in his special department. There is a general tendency in this country to 
hurry through a student’s medical education. Pause men are impatient to be at 
work, and they will flock to a school which will give them a degree after a short 
period of study and a slight examination which they are almost certain they can pass 
successfully. In this way great multitudes of practitioners are sent forth not thor- 
oughly fitted for their work, and the community has to suffer the donsequences, ** * * 
A school which depends for its existence on the number of its students cannot be 
expected to commit suicide in order to satisfy an ideal demand for perfection. Any 
institution which is essentially dependent on the number of paying stuéents it can 
draw must be tempted to sacrifice its higher aims to popularity. No high standard 
can be reached under such circumstances, and the only way to insure the independ- 
ent action of a school which aims at teaching the whole country by example is to 
endow its professorships so that the very best and highest grade of instruction, and 
not that which is popular because it is easy and superficial, may always be given 
from its chairs, whether the classes be large or small. A small number of thoroughly 
accomplished medical graduates, their knowledge based on sound scientific acquire- 
ments and made practical by assiduous clinical observation and teaching, will be 
worth more to the country than twice or thrice the number of half taught, hastily 
taught practitioners. A sebies of such classes will, in the course of a single genera- 
tion, elevate the whole professional standard, as they go forth, year after year, mis- 
sionaries in the cause of health, soldiers, and, if need be, martyrs,in the unending 
battle with disease and its cause.! 
I am obliged, for want of space, to pass without comment the interesting ques- 
tion whether a course of three years is long enough for the education of general 
practitioners, At present I am inclined to believe that it is, but that the fourth year 
should be kept up for the benefit of those students who desire to pursue some parti- 
cular department further than usual and for those practitioners who find the general 
training already received by them insuffi@ient for their entire qualification. In this 
connection it is pertinent to add that abroad the requirements for pravtising medicine 
are much higher even than those here advocated. 
MEDICAL LICENSES AND THE CONTROL OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
Having reviewed some topics connected with the preliminary qualifications of per- 
sons desiring to study medicine and with the amount and method of the medical 
instruction demanded by the nature and conditions of our present life, I pass now to 
the consideration of the best way to license persons desiring to practise medicine. 
The old and common way of allowing any one who chose to announce himself as a 
physician or surgeon isfast passing away. The later habit of being satisfied if the 
candidate for public favor could show his “diploma” has been fatally injured by the 
Jabors of John Buchanan and other proprietors of medical “ steam hatching ma- 
chines.” The device of throwing the responsibility of licensing upon voluntary asso- 
ciations of physicians called “medical societies” has succeeded only on the condi- 
tion that hommopathists, hydropathists, eclectics, &c., are not numerous or noisy 
enough to make an effective resistance. The State of Illinois seems to have solved 
the problem of protecting the public without assailing the right of personal medical 
judgment by the establishment of its State board of health. This board contains 
representatives of at least three systems of medical doctrine and practice and two 
Jay members; its method of procedure has been to ascertain not what system or 
doctrine a candidate believes or wishes to practise, but whether he hes studied the 
human body in health and disease and has investigated the action and results of

medical interference with sufficient thoroughness to enable him to act understand- 
ingly when he uses a scalpel or administers a remedy. Under such a rule, it is ob- 
vious that men of inferior attainments will be forced,to prosecute their studies till 
they have acquired a sufficient amount of knowledge to satisfy the requirements of 
the board, that medical colleges in the State and in surrounding Commonwealths 
will be stimulated to inercased exertions in order to prepare their students for the 
ordeal, and that quacks, pretenders, and rascals will be gradually forced out of the 
State. Such have been the results; and if the board had done nothing else for public 
health in Illinois it would deserve the gratitude and hearty support of every good 
, citizen ; its,severer labors about questionsof public hygiene, prevention of epidemics, 
and similar subjects are additional reasons for public gratitude, but cannot here be 
discussed. ‘ 
Passing now to the questions Tespecting the regulation and control of medical col- 
leges, I would remark that the experience of the last decade is enough to warn any 
sensible man of the dangers attending entire absence of public control over the con- 
duct of these corporations. We have seen unscrupulous and infamous men unhap- 
pily ip control of the charters of American medical schools, advertising and selling 
their wares in three continents, disgracing the profession of medicine, and soiling the 
reputation of the country which sheltered them. We have seen even the officers of 
justice conniving with these scoundrels to shield them from punishment for some of 
their guilty deeds. We have seen tardy justice at last overwhelm the most conspic- 
cuous of these offenders, the charters of his schools impeached and repealed, himself, 
a pretended suicide, fleeing frum justice to a neighboring country and even then and 
there finding dupes stupid enough or rascals vain enough to buy his worthless wares. 
We have seen him captured and inadequately punished for his long career of knavery 
by a short imprisonment. We have seen the short pause of bewilderment and dismay 
that overtook the diploma selling industry at this blow succeeded by renewed activity 
in another State, the laws of which permitted them to hope that medical colleges 
might be chartered in sufficient numbers to supply the diploma market. We have 
seen the new crop of medical mushrooms sprouting up in the State of Massachusetts, 
while the law seems inadequate to deal with the offenders. The correction for this 
condition of affairs is quite evident, but it will be difficult to attain it at once. 
Every State and Territory, and Congress for the District of Columbia, should pass 
a law ordering every school teaching medicine or surgery in any fashion whatever 
to furnish unquestionable bonds or other like security for the speedy acquirement of 
a fund amounting to not less than $300,000; the laws should direct that this sum, as 
fast as any part of it is collected, shall be invested in United States bonds or produc- 
tive real estate or interest bearing loans on real estate security; the laws should also 
prescribe that the corporations so endowed shall distribute the income derived from 
such investment equitably between at least ten professors ; that these professorsshall 
teach, didactically or clinically, at least one hundred hours apiece in each calendar 
year, the instruction by each professor to be progressive in subject and character; 
that no students shall be admitted to these courses of medical instruction before pass- 
ing a satisfactory examination in the elements of language, mathematics, physics, and 
biology; that no candidates shall be finally examined for degrees by a State board 
till they have studied three years, during each of which they must have studied at 
least one-third of the course of instruction provided by the ten professors and the 
thousand hours of teaching above mentioned, and, in addition, performed such an 
amount of dissecting, laboratory work, and hospital attendance as the faculty shall 
deem necessary; two or more schools desiring to unite their forces under the provisions 
of the acts should be allowed to do so, retaining one of the charters and names already 
in existence if they choose, but surrendering the others; and all charters not thus 
fortified and regulated within two years after the passage of the acts should be 
declared null and void. 
“TThe name of Dr. John H. Rauch, its wise, courageous, and efficient secretary, deserves special 
mention whenever the labors of the board in any direction are described.    
-P-A-G-E-174
  CLXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
Under a law like this, any ten gentlemen who possessed a sufficient quantity of 
the pnblic confidence could begin a new medical school whenever and wherever it 
was thought best, the public yould be protected from charlatans, and medical stu- 
dents would have some assurance that the money and time they spent would be of 
some value to them afterwards. The plan is perfectly practicable; and it is absurd 
to say that it is unjust to vested interests, &c. The higher courts of New York found, 
a few years ago, that admission to the bar in that State had become so easy and that 
the number of young men desiring to become lawyers was so much in excess of the 
legal business and legitimate increase of the legal profession that they must take 
measures to restrict the supply; and they did this by a prearranged order that only 
graduates of specified law schools should after a certain date be eligible “for exami- | 
nation. The other law schools in the State promptly closed their doors, and the pro- 
fession cheerfully upheld the courts in this mg but certainly unusual exeréise of 
their authority in this matter. Medical men, Unlike lawyers, are not, ipso facto, 
officers of a department of the State government; but they are, or should be, equally 
guarded by the State governments from the competition of incompetent men and from 
the injurious effects of overproduction by the medical schools. 
MEDICAL SCHOOLS FOR THE oLoRED RACE. 
I trust that the foregoing observations will not lead any reader to believe that Iam 
opposed to a wide diffusion of medical knowledge or to the imposition of any but 
educational restrictions on the production and licensing of medical men or women, 
white or black. On the contrary, I welcome every honest attempt to supply a thorough 
and systematic training to every person properly prepared to receive it and properly 
endowed to use it for the public good, Therefore I am glad to mention that the 
Shaw University, in North Carolina, felt justified in opening the Leonard Medical 
School for Colored Students in November, 1881, and that the State legislature has given 
the school an excellent site, whereon private gifts have enabled the university to 
erect both a dormitory anda building for teaching purposes. The school has adopted 
a graded scheme of instruction extending through four years and comprehending four 
lecture courses of five months each, 
Howard University Medical School, in th city, continues to give instruction, with- 
out regard to race or nes to such persons of good moral character as choose to ma- 
triculate, 
The seventh annual commencement of the Meharry Medical College was held in 
the chapel of the Tennessee Central College on the evening of February 22, 1883. 
Addresses were delivered on ‘‘ The circulatory system,” by F, R. Robey; on “ Va- 
riola,” by C. K. Wright ; and on “The duties of the physician,” by Prof. E, L, Gregory. 
Dr. Hubbard, dean of the faculty, presented the class to President Braden, who 
delivered diplomas to the following graduates: Lee Roy Fearn, V intsyille, Ala. ; 
Zebulon Wallace MceMorris, Newburg, 8, C.; Isaiah Eugene Mullon, a. B., New. Or- 
Jeans, La.; Franklin Reese Robey, Mobile, Ala. ; Cea Kenchen Wright, Atlanta, Ga. 
Near the close of the war many of the colored people crowded into Nashville. 
Their friends helped them in their poverty, feeding the hungry and clothing the 
naked. Schools were also opened for their instruction in the churches and other 
buildings hastily prepared for this purpose. In one of these church schools originated 
the Central Tennessee College. ‘The primary instruction given at first was confined 
to the primer and spelling book. This was all that was needed. The school grew 
innumbers, Other buildings were secured, A charter was obtained in 1866 with the 
present name, and in 1867 the Freedmen’s Aid Society took the school under its foster- 
ing care, and has supported it till the present. As the pupils advanced in their 
studies and were expected to prepare to teach, the normal department was organized, 
because it became a necessity ; then followed for similar reasons the theological, pre- 
paratory, and collegiate courses of study. All did not feel that their life work was

to be either teaching or preaching and some began to inquire whether it was not 
possible for them to have a medical training. As the difficulty of securing proper 
medical attention for the colored was very great and the mortality among them 
alarming, the necessity for educated physicians became apparent. In 1875, about 
ten years after the opening of the primary school, the medical department was or-

brothers, Rev. A. Meharry, p. D., and Hugh Meharry, esq.; the beautiful and com- 
modions four-story brick building now occupied by the Meharry Medical Depart- 
ment was erected. This school has conferred the degree of M. p. on 23 young 
men. Nearly all of them are engaged in the successful practice of their profession,

They have been kindly received by the white physicians, whose uniform testimony 
is that ‘these colored physicians, sent out by this school, give evidence of very 
thorough and intelligent preparation for their work, the practice of medicine. This 
is the only thoroughly organized medical school in the Mississippi Valley south of 
the Ohio River where colored persons can pursue this study; and, when it is re- 
membered that in this same territory there are over four millions of colored people, 
there is great reason that this school should be rendered most efficient by liberal

IMPROVED MEDICAL SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
Collateral to the improved methods in medical education are the improved build- 
ings in which it will hereafter be presented. The former senseless adhesion to some 
outward architectural form invented in other ages and adapted to purposes abso- 
lutely alien to modern materials and requirements is gradually but surely giving 
way to architecture wherein the purposes of the structure determine its arrangement 
and the necessities of its construction dictate its artistic form. The most recent, as 
it is the most perfect, of these medical buildings is that recently finished for the 
medical school of Harvard University, at the corner of Boylston and Exeter sireets, 
in Boston. *

warmth and ventilation are secured by steam radiators, which heat the air before it is 
distributed throughout the building, and by a series of flues which carry the vitiated 
air into a heated central shaft having a strong upward current. 
The perspective view and floor planus, kindly supplied by Messrs. Houghton, Miftlin

In connection with the summary of degrees conferred in 1882 by the very numerons 
institutions empowered to do so under the laws of the several States, I would refer to 
a correspondence between this Office and an accomplished young American lady, Miss 
Florence Kelley, who has been studying at the University of Ziirich. It appears that 
several persons practising medicine in the United States assert that they are grad- 
uates in medicine or surgery from that university, and, in fact, that some of these 
are unsuccessful candidates for those degrees. I am also informed.that the worthy 
“Pedell” of the university, Herr Henke, has in press and shortly to appear a com- 
plet@&nd authentic list of rectors, professors, instructors, and graduates in all facul- 
ties of the university since its foundation in 1833 to and including 1883. Attention 
is also invited to my remarks under the head of Review of Progress in Medical Educa- 
tion, pp. clxy et seq.

  OLXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
Adding the totals of the preceding summary to those of the summaries of 1881, 1880, 
1879, 1878, 1877, 1876, and of the Special Report on Public Libraries published by this 
Bureau in 1876 (see also the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1875, p. evii), 
we have the following aggregates for the libraries now reported: 
  Total number of public libraries reported, each haying 300 volumes or 
    
   
         
   
   
             is 4,119

Total yearly expenditures for salaries and in dental expenses (807 Tip 
ries reporting)... az 800, 122 
  It should be noted, ho'vever, that the figures for these items are but approximately 
true for the libraries of the country, inasmuch as they do not include the very con- 
siderable increase of the 3,647 libraries embraced in the Special Report on Public 
Libraries or the increase of the 341 libraries embraced in the Reports of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, and 1881, from the dates thereof 
to the present time. 
The foregoing statistical summaries show that this report contains statistics respect- 
ing 131 libraries not mentioned previously in my reports, and that the number so 
reported since and including the annual report for 1875 has been 4,119, 
The reports of other countries can show no parallel to this voluntary and uniform 
method of collecting and communicating information respecting these establishments, 
so graphically called the universities of the people. If circumstances permit, I de- 
sign to take up the subject of public libraries again in a special publication, reprinting 
such parts of the special report on public libraries (now quite out of print) as have 
permanent value; another publication projected is a fresh statistical tabulation re- 
specting all the libraries of public or semipublic character in the United States; but 
these designs are as yet work for the future chiefly, 
During the eighteen months covered by this statement several matters of much in- 
terest have agitated the library world. The proper selection of a plan forthe Library 
of Congress is one of these. Respecting this I would only suggest that in the consider- 
ation and adoption of plans for library buildings anywhere the judgment of experts in 
the storage and management of books is as important for the best success as the judg- 
ment of experts in building, and that special care seems requisite in the case of the 
Library of Congress, because the building when erected will be expected by the public 
to embody the best appliances, arrangements, and ideas about library construction.! 
Among the important gifts to libraries during the year, the transfer of the private 
library of Dr. Joseph Meredith Toner to the Library of Congress’ requires special 
mention. This valuable medical and surgical collection numbers about 27,000 books 
and 12,000 pamphlets, the results of Doctor Toner’s personal collection and purchase 
during his whole professional life; itis the first free gift of a large library to the nation, 
and, as such, deserves that, like the Library of George III in the British Museum, it 
be kept together for the future and designated by the donov’s name. E 
The Boston (Mass.) Public Library also, since the date of my last report, has received 
an important accession by gift of the library of J. Montgomery Sears, esq., which 
ineludes the famous book collection of Ferdinand Freiligrath, the German poet and 
politician; this valuable present numbered 6,000 yolumes. This great city library, 
the friendly rival of our national collection in its number of volumes, has also been 
preparing to erect a new building on the land given by the State. For some time 
an effort was made to adapt the high and Latinschool building to the purposes of the 
library, but this project did not meet with any cordial support among library experts 
  
1 The Library of Congress at the end of 1882 contained 480,076 volumes and 160,000 pamphlets.
-P-A-G-E-187
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, CLXXXVII 
or the public press; so that the site on Dartmouth and Boylston streets will doubt- 
less be occupied ina few years with a library building in which the utmost care, 
skill, safety, handiness, and wise economy of space will be shown. Meanwhile anew 
branch library at the north end of the city has been opened. 
Philadelphia, though possessing admirable libraries, particularly that of the Li- 
brary Company, has been discussing the formation of a free public library. In these 
matters, and especially when the need of books can be supplied at small personal cost, 
it may be well to make haste slowly, lest the public lose what it already possesses 
without gaining any adequate substitute. 
New York City, great and rich and busy as it is, seems to have little time to think. 
about the culture of its people. Not the Astor Library with its 200,000 volumes, the 
Lenox Library with its priceless Americana and its bibliographical treasures, the val- 
uable possessions of the Historical Society, the Young Men’s Christian Association, 
the Mercantile Library, nor the united resources of the rest of the collections seem 
to satisfy the needs of the city. Probably a scheme of reading, prepared and encour- 
aged by the school authorities, would be the proper beginning for the great collection 
that such a city as New York ought to have. The future public trained to need the 
library and the library itself would thus grow up together, and before many years 
the average tone and intelligence of New York in relation to books and reading would 
be modified greatly for the better. ® 
Yet another noble gift to libraries is the collection of 12,000 volumes, once owned 
by the late Hon. George P. Marsh, LL. D., formerly our minister to Italy and one of 
the greatest and most modest scholars that this country has produced. The Hon. 
Frederick Billings has purchased and presented these volumes to the library of the 
University of Vermont, to which at one time Mr. Marsh, before his long service to his 
country had made him poor, designed giving his books. It is fortunate that the col- 
lege has thus received the books without impoverishing the family of the collector. 
Rochester, N. Y., has been offered by Mr. Mortimer F, Reynolds, one of its worthiest 
citizens, real estate now producing an income of $40,000 per annum, on condition that 
the city shall release all taxes thereon when it is conveyed to a free public library 
association. Doubtless this generous offer will result in another large library founda- 
tion. . 
The village of Fredonia, N. Y., has been given property by Judge Darwin R. Bar- 
ker in order to endow a free public library, George M. Pullman, noted for his good 
works as well as for his sleeping cars, has given 5,000 volumes to the town of Pullman, 
IL, as the nucleus of a free public library. Beaufort, 8. C., has been given 800 
choice books by the Hon. Edward L. Pierce, of Milton, Mass., and a book room to 
contain them by Mr. R. K. Darrah, of Boston; the charge for using this library is 3 
cents a week. Mr. John Carlovitz, a teacher, of Milton, Fla., has collected a library 
of 2,500 volumes, which he designs to present, together with a natural history collec- 
tion, to some institution of learning in the town, of permanent character and properly 
chartered. Meanwhile the library and museum are handsomely cased and deposited 
in the custody of the Masonic fraternity, in whose building a room for their safe 
keeping has been set apart. Surely the generosity and self denying labor of such 
men deserve commemoration among a people who have abolished all hereditary dig- 
nities and allow a man to leave his children only the property he has accumulated. 
The Public Library of Chicago, having outgrown its present quarters, is now medi- 
tating the construction of a new building on a new site. In addition to Dr. Poole’s 
many labors in this direction and on other subjects, this indefatigable worker has 
lately begun a labor designed to bring the public school and its teacher into more in- 
timate relations with the public library and its custodian. He invites a single school 
or class, with its teacher, to visit the library on a Saturday morning designated in 
advance. Here they find Dr, Poole surrounded by all the books in the library that 
treat of the subject intended for the morning’s conversation. By showing how in- 
teresting that subject is as a department of human thought and industry and how

much the contents of the library may help the student to a knowledge of the subject, 
he has succeeded in producing a profound and beneficial effect on the upper grades 
of the school system. This connection between library and school, both in Chicago 
and elsewhere, is the true solution of the whole matter, the school training the 
reader to use the book for his own information, and the library training him to use 
the book he reads for the benefit of himself and others.

  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS. CLXXXIX 
Perhaps a little care should be exercised lest the support and enthusiasm which en- 
courage the beginning of these schools should wane and the enterprises fall through 
from after lack of interest. Still, the need of trained murses is so very great, even 
in private cases, that all qualified persons now living can find remunerative work, 
and a judicious increase in the number of schools for their instruction will meet with 
public support and approval. 
In connection with this subject, it is timely to invite attention to the propriety of 
establishing ‘“ directories” for nurses, such as those in Boston, Philadelphia, Washing- 
ton, and other cities, where families and physicians may apply for them and where 
unemployed nurses may leave their addresses and references. 
Nor should the importance of nurses’ homes be forgotten. The women engaged in 
this laborious, monotonous, and almost sacred duty must of necessity be chiefly drawn 
from the unmarried and unprotected portion of their sex. A home, where they can 
find peace, rest, cheerful company, and healthy regimen during the intervals between 
their engagements, and where pupils may lodge while under instruction, is of the 
greatest value to them and to the community they serve. I am happy to report that 
the Washington Nurses’ School has at last been able to open a “ home” of this kind 
at 1321 H stgeet n. w. This school has graduated its second class of thoroughly trained 
nurses, and with the increased faci itjes now at its command will doubtless extend 
its work and usefulness.

Cxcl. REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The condition of deaf-mute education is satisfactory and has not been affected by 
any unusual occurrences during the year. An institution has been established in 
New Jersey. Increased attention is being paid to giving facilities for education to 
colored deaf-mutes. Provision was made for them in North Carolina as early as 1867 
and in Maryland in 1872. Departments for the colored pupils exist in the Tennessee 
and Mississippi institutions. Georgia and South Carolina are more recently assum- 
ing their burdens of this character. 
The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Rev. Thomas H. Gallaudet occurs 
in 1887, andit is proposed that the deaf-mutes of the country erect a statue to the 
man whose life and family have been closely identified with their education. Phila- 
delphia and Washington (Kendall Green) have been suggested as suitable places. 
A new feature of the Nebraska Institute is the attempt of its principal, Mr. J. A. 
Gillespie, to cultivate the power of hearing in cases where there is any to be developed, 
so that semi-deaf persons may distinguish sounds and even spoken language. 
METHODS OF DEAF-MUTE INSTRUCTION. 
The different methods of instruction in language are often mentioned and dis- 
cussed, but are rarely defined so as to be intelligible to the common reader. Prof. 
Edward A. Fay, editor of the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb, has stated 
the essentials of each method with unusual clearness, and the following defini- 
tions of the manual, oral, and combined methods are taken from one of his editorials: 
By the manual method is meant the course of instruction which employs the sign 
Janguage, the manual alphabet, and writing as the chief means in the education of 
the deaf, and has facility in the comprehension and use of written language as its 
principal object. The degree of relative importance given to these three means 
varies in different schools ; but it is a difference only of degree, and the end aimed at 
is the same in all. If the pupils have some power of speech before coming to school 
or if they possess a considerable degree of hearing, their teachers usually try to im- 
prove their utterance by practice; but no special teachers are employed for this pur- 
pose and comparatively little attention is given to articulation, 
By the oral method is meant that in which: signs are used as little as possible; the 
manual alphabet is generally discarded altogether, and articulation and lip reading, 
together with writing, are made the chief means as well as the end of instruction. 
Here, too, there is a difference in different schools in the extent to which the use of 
signs is allowed in the early part of the course; but it is a difference only of degree, 
and the end aimed at is the same in all. 
The combined method is not so easy to define, as the term is employed with reference 
to seyeral distinct methods, such as (1) the frap use of both signs and articulation 
with the same pupils and by the same teachers ieasneut the course of instruction ; 
(2) the general instruction of all the pupils by means of the manual method with 
the special training of a part ‘of them in articulation and lip reading as an accom- 
plishment ; (3) the instruction of some pupils by the manual method and others by 
the oral method in the same institution; (4)— though this israther a combined system — 
the employment of the manual method and the oral method in separate schools under 
the same general management, pupils being sent to one establishment or the other, as 
seems best with regard to each individual case. 
Elmentary instruction — Alexander Graham Bell, py. D., has made an interesting 
and successful experiment in the instruction of a congenitally deaf boy five years of 
age. The plan adopted was to familiarize the child with written language by means 
of play. The child’s school room was turned into a play room, and language lessons 
were given through the instrumentality of toys and games. Words were taught first. 
Tite names of playthings were put on them and a search instituted for their counter- 
parts in a collection of names on cards. Afterward the child was required to ask for 
playthings and food by presenting cards, with the proper names on them. Words 
signifying action were added later. Sentence exercises were soon begun in the forms 
of impromptu conversations and regular sentences. The impromptu conversations 
were written on a blackboard, with the words which should be emphasized in speak- 
ing written large. After the writing, pantomime was used sparingly to explain 
it. The regular sentence exercises consisted of imperative sentences written on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
DEAF-MUTE INSTRUCTION. OXCIIr 
board, and their commands obeyed first by the pupil, afterward by the teacher, when 
the pupil pointed toasentence. The child soon wished to write as well as point 
out the sentence, and instruction in writing wascommenced. At first partially erased 
sentences were traced over. Then copies of sentences were made. The need of spell- 
ing was soon felt, and a glove with the letters located upon it was put on his left 
hand. He was soon taught to find particular letters and to point out in order those 
that formed individual words. Professor Bell soon could communicate with him by 
touching the places on his hands corresponding to those on the glove where letters 
were located. From this time onward the child was required to communicate by 
language, and progressed rapidly in its skilful use. He was afterward admitted to 
the primary department of the Columbia Institution and was distinguished for freo- 
dom and accuracy in the use of language. It is thought this trial will afford encour- 
agement and aid to parents in giving home instruction. ‘If pupils could commence 
their school course,” says Professor Bell, ‘‘with even an imperfect and rudimentary 
knowledge of English, the labor of the teacher would be enormously reduced and 
the progress of the pupil immensely accelerated.” 
Preparation for college.—It is important for the instructors of deaf-mutes to be well 
informed as to the nature of the preparation they should give pupils intending to 
pursue a higher course of studies, and such information is suggestive to many who 
are brought into other relations with such pupils. Prof. A. G. Draper, a. M., pre- 
sented a paper on this subject at the tenth convention of American instructors of the 
deaf and dumb, held at Jacksonyille, Il., in August, 1882. He says that the first 
and foremost requisite is the ability to use and to understand the English language. 
This may be increased by substituting, as far as possible, the use of connected lan- 
guage in place of sign language. Proficiency in arithmetic is a second essential, 
because its principles underlie all mathematics and its study develops the power of 
attention and ideas of order, value, and proportion. 
Lip reading should be familiarized before entering college, as afterward the required 
work does not allow leisure for the acquirement of elementary skill, though constant 
opportunities for intercourse exist. A trade should be learned, as a resource against 
misfortunes that may deprive one of other fields of labor. The use of tobacco should 
be prevented, as it is an obstacle in the path of mental and physical improvement. 
Bodily exercise should be taken, for by strengthening the muscles of the deaf-mutes 
‘‘we shall store up the energy, courage, and temper without which their best gifts 
will be of little worth.” Finally, moral instruction should be faithfully imparted, 
especially by personal efforts and example.

cators of the blind are the industries most suitable to their pupils, the adoption of a 
single kind of printing, the regulation of the association of the sexes, the medical 
care to be bestowed, and the removal of prejudices against sending children from 
home to an institution commonly but erroneously called an asylum. They find the 
same need of the codperation of parents, of prompt and regular attendance, and 
of an appropriate arrangement of studies which is felt by teachers in ordinary pub-

lie schools. The mind of a blind child is developed by the usual methods of educa- 
tion, but these must be employed by patient, skilful, and sympathetic teachers in 
order to produce immediate and permanent results. 
The attendance upon schools for the blind is much smaller than it should be. The 
Michigan school had 73 pupils in 1882, and its superintendent, Mr. J. F. McElroy, 
estimates the number of blind persons in the State who are of proper age and condi- 
tion to beeducated at 350. 
It is estimated that only 25 per cent. of the blind in Arkansas who are of suitable 
age to be admitted to the State school are or have been in it. The reasons given for 
this are the ignorance of the people as to the existence of the school, the supposition 
that the school is not free but expensive, the idea that the school is a sort of poor- 
house, the reluctance of parents to be separated from their unfortunate children, 
and the failure of the State to supply full accommodations and to enable the officers 
of the school to offer its privileges to all those who are deserving of them. 
It seems to be always in order to urge those having the care of young blind children 
to treat them in such a way as to prepare them for school duties when they are of 
sufficient age to leave home. The age at which they should enter a school of the 
usual character depends much upon the circumstances of the family. A rule given 
by a good authority is that, if they can be under good influence at home, can have 
the care of mother or sister, can exercise freely in the open air, can be taught ele- 
mentary studies, it is better for them to remain at home until they are twelve years old; 
but, if they cannot receive proper care and be taught to some considerable extent, they 
should enter at the age of nine or ten. Dr. 8. G. Howe was emphatic in cautioning 
parents against too much indulgence of sightless children. His ideas are shown by 
the following quotation: 
Do uot prevent your blind child from developing as he grows up, in courage, gener- 
osity, self reliance, and manliness of character, by excessive self indulgence, by spar- 
ing him thought and anxiety and hard work, by giving him undeserved preference 
over others. Much may be done for his advantage by judicious firmness, by reso- 
lutely insisting that he shall learn to do everything for himself and for those about 
him which it is possible to do without actually looking at things. 
Keep him out of doors and running about as much as possible. Bear in mind that 
he is exercising for health and strength, and that his object is to be in the open air 
and to keep warm by exercise, not by extra clothing. ‘But the benefit accruing to 
your blind child from such continued exercise and work in the open air is not con- 
fined to his bodily growth and health ; for the effort to do something useful, to bestir 
himself and to keep himself warm, is good exercise for his moral nature; for every 
habit of meeting and overcoming little difficulties increases courage and self reliance. 
Hon. F. J. Campbell, 11. p., principal of the Royal Normal College and Academy 
of Music for the Blind, Upper Norwood, London, Eng., puts great emphasis on phys- 
ical training. In his report for 1881 he says: 
By careful examination it will be found that the blind men who are leading lives 
of usefulness are those who have not allowed their blindness to debar them from 
physicalactivity. Professor Fawcett in his able addresses on blindness has repeatedly 
borne testimony to this fundamental truth. The pupils of the Royal Normal College 
who have been most energetic in regard to their physical development have achieved 
the best results when they have gone forth to test their value in the open market. 
Owing to the lack of physical training, young blind persons come to us awkward and 
helpless, although they have been several years under mechanical training. 
The disposition to give blind children suitable medical attention and opportunities 
for physical culture is manifest in many schools. The strength and vigor of blind 
youth are not up to the average. The same causes which operated to produce blind- 
ness have also resulted in other evils, sometimes scarcely less deplorable. 
The object of physical culture is to increase the strength and fortify the health, 
The aim of the medical efforts is to remove pain and disease, and in some cases to 
restore sight. The trustees of the Iowa College for the Blind appointed two physicians, 
expert ‘‘ophthalmologists,” to examine and operate upon the eyes of the members of 
the college. They reported that none had been made worse by their interference 
and that many successful operations had been performed. They found over'40 per- 
sons needing their special attention, half of them for increase of vision and half for
-P-A-G-E-196

the purpose of personal comfort and for relief of pain. Nearly as many more could 
be benefited by medical treatment and the adjustment of glasses. The regular course 
of instruction pursued in the literary, musical, and industrial departments has not 
undergone any marked change. The studies in the literary departments are like 
those of elementary public schools and are graded as closely as circumstances will 
allow. The instruction in music is continued with profit to pupils and with pleasure 
to their friends. Occasionally it seems necessary to neutralize the effect of some un- 
fair criticism of the blind in their work as tuners of instruments by stating their pe- 
culiar fitness for that occupation and the success they have obtained in it. The loss 
of sight seems to quicken the senses of feeling and hearing and to bestow faculties 
peculiarly serviceable to tuners, so that manufacturers and eminent musicians have 
frequently shown preference for blind tuners. The industrial departments include the 
trades mentioned on page 76 of the abstract, and new occupations are being sought 
by the heads of these departments. Broom making and caning still appear to give 
the best results. The profits from the former industry to the Kansas institution for 
the two years ending June 30, 1882, were $820.06, besides $815.25 paid the boys for 
labor. Silk culture has been tried at the Arkansas school. The superintendent, 
Mr. Otis Patten, reported results as follows: 
Two things are proved by our experiment: First, that silk culture can be carried 
on by intelligent blind persons directed by the seeing where sight is indispensable ; 
and, second, that they can do it without special instruction in the institution. Anin- 
telligent blind person can take the manuals prepared for the purpose, and with a see- 
ing person to, read for him can get a knowledge of the subject. I would not advise 
anybody to embark in the business who has not the proper food on hisown grounds. 
Some of our girls who were in the class mentioned in the essay intend to pursue the 
business when they go home. We do not think it necessary to repeat the experiment 
in our institution, but will read to our girls enough to interest them in silk culture. 
Theintroduction of Kindergarten methods or the addition of the Kindergarten itself 
is advocated earnestly by many of those in charge of the education of the blind. It 
is argued that a large part of these unfortunates are among surroundings of vice and 
destitution and should be removed from them at the earliest moment practicable, 
before corrupt tendencies and vicious propensities are hardened and crystallized into 
permanent habits. Mr. M. Anagnos, superintendent of the Perkins Institution and 
Massachusetts School for the Blind, would have a separate school for this purpose, 
with suitable grounds, ample endowment, and nothing to compromise its educational 
character. The pupils should be received when from five to nine years of age, “‘re- 
tained until the age of twelve, and taught and trained objectively according to the 
simple and rational methods developed in Frébel’s Kindergarten.” The trustees of 
the institution favor such a school. They say in their annual report for 1882: 
For such children the Kindergarten system, with the genial warmth of kindness 
radiating from its principles, with its methodically arranged gifts and games, its 
block building, weaving, sewing, and modelling, affords the best and most efficient 
means of training. It is calculated to awaken, strengthen, and regulate their facul- 
ties of imagination, volition, and action, which are. weakened by their infirmity, 
depressed by the wretchedness of their surroundings, and benumbed by the frost of 
their privations. It promises to raise them up from a state of misery, sloth, and tor- 
por, to that of comfort, activity, and diligence. It will create a new era in the his- 
tory of the education of the blind by laying the foundations and increasing the possi- 
bilities of a higher standard of attainments than has hitherto been reached. 
Mr. B. B. Huntoon, superintendent of the Kentucky institution, speaks of his ex- 
perience with the Kindergarten as follows: 
‘The Kindergarten department, under the charge of a skilled teacher from Mr. Hail- 
mann’s training school in Detroit, has answered every expectation formed of its great 
practical usefulness in a school for the blind. In training the senses, in stimulating 
thought, and in developing the mind, it seems to furnish the methods needed to make 
broad and strong the foundations of an education. 
Some of the results of the education of the blind are shown in the following quota- 
tion from the report of Mr. William Chapin, superintendent of the Pennsylvania in- 
stitution : 
Of the 32 institutions for the blind in America sustained mainly by the States, 
10 were originated by blind graduates: 4 from the Pennsylvania institution, 5 from
-P-A-G-E-197

the Ohio, and 1 from the Massachusetts institution. This isa gratifying record of the 
talent, energy, and perseverance of these persons under trying difficulties. 
Referring to statistics reported to a convention of American superintendents in 
1878, of the graduates of these institutions 16 became superintendents of institutions 
for the blind and 5 of orphan asylums; instructors in literature, music, and handi- 
eraft, 502; clergymen, 34; piano tuners and repairers, 125; students and graduates 
of colleges, 36; agents and lecturers, 71; editors, lawyers, and physicians, 30; store- 
keepers and traders, 277. Classifying these and others, it appeared that the number 
engaged in literary or mental work was 710; in music and tuning pianos, 527; in handi- 
eraft, 1,111; total, 2,348, 
These numbers would be considerably enlarged up to the present time. 
Mrs. Asa D. Lord, matron of the New York State institution, reviewed the work of 
institutions for the blind in an excellent paper before the convention of instructors of 
the blind held in August, 1882, at Janesville, Wis. A few clauses from her remarks 
give a concise view of the situation : 
The coming year, the first of the last half of the century [of instruction for the 
blind], will mark a new era in the progress of the education of the blind. We stand 
on high vantage ground. Our buildings in the main are ample, well furnished, and 
well adapted to their uses. We have improved and vastly increased appliances to 
facilitate our work, for which, I trust, we are truly grateful. Our pupils, as in the 
past, are the beautiful, the deformed, the strong, the weak, physically, morally, and 
intellectually. j 
It is our work to take these contrasting and widely diversified powers and develop 
from them men and women who shall be fitted to take honored and useful places in 
society, not only in the estimation of men, but in God’s sight. 
VISIT OF DR. WILLIAM MOON. 
The intention of Dr, William Moon, of Brighton, Eng., to visit this country for the 
purpose of extending his work for the blind, was announced in my last annual report. 
An authoritative account of this visit has been published, from which the following 
paragraphs are taken: 
In tke month of April, 1882, at the request of Sir Charles Lowther, Dr. Moon, ac- 
companied by his daughter, paid a visit to several cities of the United States to see 
what could be done by way of establishing home teaching and free lending libra- 
ries for their blind. The visit was most successful; throughout the whole of his tour 
Dr. Moon was warmly received by the various authorities of the institutions he visited, 
and at Philadelphia the Bible Society displayed the deepest interest in circulating 
copies of the Bible in his type, through the agency of home teaching and free libraries. 
Mr. Rhoades, the treasurer of the Bible Society, through a requisition signed by Mr. 
Chapin, principal of the School for the Blind, Mr. Hall, superintendent of the Work- 
shop for the Blind, and Miss Lloyd, president of the Home for Blind Women, convened 
a public meeting which was held at the Bible Society House. At this meeting a home 
teaching society was formed and a committee appointed for arranging the details of 
the work. Teachers were shortly afterwards appointed, and Dr. Moon had the pleas- 
ure of seeing the work progressing before his return to England. 
At Mr. Chapin’s institution, as soon as the books arrived which had been pre- 
sented by Sir Charles Lowther, they were distributed among the inmates, and as many 
as 114 were able to read them in the short space of 8 days. Thirty of these readers 
were adults accustomed to work and unable to read any of the books embossed in the 
United States. This, it may be remarked, was not owing to any defect in the em- 
bossing, for the books are beautifully printed, and sufficiently raised for the use of 
children, both at the American Printing House at Louisville and at Boston, but 
owing to the complex form of the letters, which is avoided in Dr. Moon’s simplified 
alphabet. At the Workshop for the Blind and the Home for Blind Women, good pro: 
ress was soon made when the books were presented to those institutions, and Mr. 
Hall, the admirable superintendent of the workshop, who is himself blind and who 
could never read the American embossed books, was among the early readers of Dr. 
Moon’s type. Sir C. H. Lowther has kindly made a present of the entire Bible to this 
institution, and it was most gratifying to hear Mr. Hall’s warm and grateful expres- 
sions in reference to the benefits the inmates would receive therefrom. ” 
At Chicago Mr. W. H. Bradley and his son manifested great interest in the work of 
home teaching, and called a number of friends together and laid the matter before 
them. Twelve married gentlemen and their wives immediately gave their names as 
members of a committee and a sufficient amount was subscribed for a complete set of 
Dr. Moon’s books to form a free library. A teacher was expected to be soon appointed, 
and the names and addresses to be obtained of the entire blind of the city. Before Dr. 
Moon left Chicago he had the gratification of knowing that several of the blind had

learned to read and were anticipating with much pleasure the use of the boeks of the 
new library. 
At Boston and New York promises were received from friends that in the autumn 
of the year they would use their endeavors to carry out the same means for the blind 
of these cities. 
The success of Dr. Moon’s efforts is indicated by the following extract from a letter 
from Mr. J. P. Rhoades, of Philadelphia, through whom much las been done to ad- 
vance the interests of the adult blind and the introduction of Dr, Moon’s system of 
printing: 
  Tam glad to say that the results of our efforts to reachthe adult blind who cannot learn 
to read by the old system are highly encouraging. I have received numerous applica- 
tions from the blind living in various parts of the United States, and have mailed to 
.them the alphabet and elementary reading cards. Many of these have informed me 
that after a few weeks’ study they have learned to read and are now using the books. 
We are reaching those who are isolated from all other efforts in their behalf, and who 
have no access to institutions designed for their benefit, and who never supposed it 
possible to learn to read.

INSTRUCTION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. CxcIx 
The education of feeble-minded children is undertaken by public authorities not so 
much as a charity as a means of increasing the productiveness of a large class of de- 
fective eitizens and decreasing the probability of the transmission of their defects to 
another generation. Many children of undeveloped intellect are in popular estima- 
tion included among those almost hopelessly idiotic. While the latter class may be 
improved by the careful training of their muscles and their habits of life and action, 
the most satisfactory results have been obtained with the more intelligent. Their 
training is painfully sfow and must provide for the gradual increase of physical 
power, the stimulating of the senses, and the application of the mind to tasks judi- 
ciously assigned. Their education cannot come from instruction in the branches 
taught to stronger youth so much as from simpler exercises calling will power into 
play and withdrawing the attention from personal feelings and wishes. Still, tha 
classification of feeble-minded youth for purposes of school work is very complete in 
several institutions. This is necessary in order to accomplish the most possible in 
this difficult work at the smallest expense. The English schools pay less attention to 
formal educational efforts than do ours, and some American instructors are inclined 
to imitate their example. Certainly the health of these youth is of primary impor- 
tance, as it is frequently on an equality with their mental condition. Recreation and 
labor are the means for strengthening both body and mind. The recreations must be 
of the simplest kind, and the labor adapted to the abilities of the child. The demand 
for farms and agricultural employment is made by institutions having only small 
tracts of land. Massachusetts has provided a farm to which the school can send a 
portion of its inmates who are best fitted for farm work. The Ohio institution finds 
its large tract of land of great value to its pupils. There are some simple trades 
that may be followed by the feeble-minded, but their condition of mind and body di- 
ininishes their ability to do farm work less than it does their efficiency in shops, 
The usefulness of institutions is increased when they are enabled to extend care to 
feeble-minded adults, for whom no provision exists outside the poor-house. It is pub- 
lie economy to remove such from a life whose probable tendency is toward an ulti- 
mately increased burdening of the community. It has been said that ‘the helpless 
condition and prospective fate of these children of misfortune, after they have received 
all the training, both mental and physical, that any school can give them, appeal 
strongly and constantly to the same spirit of public charity that founded the present 
asyluins, for further protection.”

One of the questions naturally asked about the inmates of reform schools is as to 
their antecedents. Statistics bearing on this inquiry are collected by nearly all the 
schools. They show that the offender has almost always been idle; that he has very 
frequently been the child of parents born in foreign countries; that a large propor- 
tion of the boys have no father living; and that, contrary to the prevailing opinion, 
their parents are not usually intemperate. The statistics of different States vary 
greatly as to the social condition of parents, and an equal dissimilarity exists be- 
tween city and country schools. After giving percentages of children coming from 
specified clafSes of surroundings, Mr. Israel C. Jones, superintendent of the House of 
Refuge on Randall’s Island, near New York City, comments upon the statistics as 
follows: 
“It does not appear from the foregoing that intemperance is a prevailing vice with 
the parents, nor that the delinquency of the children is chargeable to their being 
orphans, for about 86 per cent. of the fathers and 94 per cent. of the mothers are 
found ‘to be temperate people, and correspondingly few of the children have lost both 
parents. A noticeable feature that probably contributes to their delinquency is the 
thriftlessness of the parents, as indicated by the character of the homes and the 
lack of forethought in laying up any portion of their earnings against want. From 
75 to 80 per cent. are known to live in crowded tenement houses, and about the same 
proportion are possessed of no property except their furniture, which is often scanty.

ccll REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The reform school of the present is a decided improvement on those which were 
first established, some sixty years ago. ‘Tho changes effected have been stated as fol- 
lows in a pamphlet issued by the Colorado State Industrial School : 
_ In the earlier history of these schools all inmates were classed together. For their 
safe keeping it was thought necessary to fasten them in cells at night; strong iron 
bars guarded the windows; heavy doors, constantly locked and bolted, closed the 
passages; and the premises were surrounded by high stone walls. Great improve- 
ments have marked the progress of reform schools. In the modern reformatory 
neither high walls, cells, bolts, nor bars dre found. Nothing in the surroundings dis- 
tinguishes them from first class public schools. Neat fences inclose the grounds, 
which are beautified by trees, shrubs, lawns, and flowers. Well kept roads and walks 
lead to the various places of interest, and thus the very grounds are used to teach 
important lessons, 
A description of some of these institutions shows them to be inviting in appearance 
and attractive in surroundings. For example, the Ohio Reform School is a village of 
itself, excellently laid out and provided with conveniences. 
The buildings consist of the main building ; the Ohio, Hocking, Muskingum, Cuy- 
ahoga, Scioto, Huron, Miami, Erie, Maumee, and Union family buildings; shoe, brush, 
blacksmith, tailor, paint, carpenter, bake shops; carriage, meat, ware, engine, gas, ice, 
corn, and green houses; water tower, hospital, mending room, knitting room, cham- 
pet of reflection, laundry, two horse barns, a piggery, cow barn, and numerous out- 
uildings. 
The emily, buildings are arranged in a segment of a circle around the main build- 
ing, with the exception of a double building, called the Ohio, for the use of the very 
youngest boys, which is separated from the main and other buildings nearly half a 
mile, but is connected with the rest of the institution by a good board walk. These 
family buildings are named for the rivers in the State. The building for the young- 
est boys has three stories above the basement. On the first floor are two rooms for 
the elder brother and his family, two school rooms with folding doors between, 
which, when open, throw both into a sitting room for the boys in the evening. There 
is a wide hall separating the elder brother’s rooms from the school rooms. On the 
second floor are rooms for the teachers and two dormitories. On the third floor are 
rooms for the employés and two smaller dormitories. The basement serves as a play 
house and a place where the boys prepare themselves for school or detail. This build- 
ing accommodates about one hundred boys under twelve yewrs of age. There is con- 
nected with it a kitchen, dining room, and workshop, so the boys have no communi- 
cation with the large boys, only coming over to chapel on the Sabbath. 
Of the other family buildings, four are 57 feet long by 36 wide and are three steries 
high above the basement. The remaining five are like the four, with the exception 
of being but two stories high above the basement. Each of these nine buildings 
makes a good, comfortable home for fifty boys. 
    The treatment of the inmates of reform schools has improved as much as the build- 
ings in which they are accommodated and the methods of instruction. Home life 
more attractive than they have ever known awaits many of those committed. Kind- 
ness and patience awaken hope and confidence in many a dark and suspicious mind. 
The future welfare of the inmates is primarily regarded by most institutions, nof only 
in the studies and labors required, but also in the attention given them. This is 
indicated in a circular issued recently by the board of managers of the Connecticut 
State Reform School. The methods and advantages of the institution are described 
in the following terms: 
  The institution is not a prison, but a school of detention and reform, where the in- 
nates receive such instruction and training as are best adapted to form gnd perpetu- 
ate a virtuous character, to establish habits of industry, and to advance them in those 
branches of knowledge which are tanght in the common schools of the State. They 
are here provided with a home in every way pleasant and comfortable ; are furnished 
with steady employment that will aid them in earning an honest living after they 
Jeave the school; They ha appropriate seasons for recreation and play, are well 
fed and clothed, and when sick have the best of care and medical attendance. They 
attend school regularly six days of the week, are taught by experienced and efficient 
teachers, and on Sunday enjoy the privileges of the Sabbath school and one regular 
chapel service, over which some minister of the gospel from one of the city churches 
presides. The Catholic boys of the school receive one hour of instruction each Sab- 
bath {rom the Sisters of Mercy.

REFORMATORY INSTRUCTION. ocr 
Mr. J. J. Barclay, president of the board of managers of the House of Refuge at 
Philadelphia, describes the life of inmates there as follows: 
Great care is bestowed on the training, health, and comfort of the inmates. The 
discipline is parental and calculated to prepare them for the duties of life. When 
sick they are placed in an admirable infirmary and attended by experienced aif 
skilful piyeluiens and an excellent nurse. They are employed about seven hours a 
day in the workshops or household duties, are engaged three hours in the school rooms 
under excellent teachers, and strenuous efforts made to instruct them in the elements 
of a good education. They are allowed ample opportunity for exercise in the open 
air and in the recreations suitable for the young. They are provided with a well 
selected library, affording them the means of acquiring valuable information and 
mental enjoyment. 
The daily routine of these schools is so planned as to avoid too rigorous exactions 
and to secure the full value of their time and strength to the inmates and less di- 
rectly to the institutions. A division of the day between study, labor, and recreation. 
is effected so as to give a suitable proportion to each. An example of this and of the 
attention paid to other minor details may be taken from the report of the Girls’ In- 
dustrial Home, Delaware, Ohio. The matron says: 
The work hours are from 8 to 11 A. M., the school hours from 1.30 to 4.30 P.M. In 
the work and school room, the schedules require promptness to the minute, as indi- 
cated by the central bell. The time for recreation is so arranged as to allow all a 
liberal amount of exercise. Special attention is given to the housekeeping and laun- 
dry departments, so as to have the girls, if possible, when discharged from the home 
second to none in this very important branch of woman’s education ; also, the work in 
the sewing room is carefully watched, so as to secure both neatness and promptness 
in the use of the needle. To secure harmony and equality in the kitchen instruction, 
as well as to secure an economical variety of food, we have provided a regular bill of 
fare, by which all are equally governed. 
Mr. W. C. Sampson, superintendent of the Colorado State Industrial School, says 
that the course of industrial, mental, moral, and religious instruction in that institu- 
tion ‘is arranged to correct the bad and vicious habits already partially formed; to 
induce the love of system, regularity, and cleanliness in heart and person; to create 
a thirst for knowledge and habits of industry as a means of earning a competence, 
comfort, and happiness; to elevate the low moral and religious standard to the Bible 
standard; and to thoroughly instil the love of country and good citizenship.” The 
necessity of not only industrial instruction but also of comparatively uninstructive 
labor is understood. The constant use of the head and the hands is effective in crowd- 
ing out and keeping out of a boy’s mind the thought and desire of wrong doing and 
deprives him of time for accomplishing mischief. ‘‘An important auxiliary in the ref- 
ormation of boys, at least,” as is said by Mr. J. Hood Laverty, superintendent of the 
Philadelphia House of Refuge, ‘is regular, steady, concentrated work. Neither 
idle boys with dishonest tendencies nor girls with lewd inclinations can ever be re- 
formed until they are taught to love and adapt themselves to steady, continuous work 
of some kind, and to understand that all honest labor is not only respectable but 
yields pecuniary advantage.” Consequently, as much of the work of a reform school 
as possible is performed by the inmates, whether boys or girls; with the latter, house 
work is given most prominence. The future of girls who are qualified to enter fumi- 
yies, and do so, is much more secure than that of girls passing from school life into 
shops and Jpctories. The trustees of the State primary and reform schools of Mas- 
sachusetts, in a recent report, say: 
The house work, ai first irksome to a girl who has been leading a lazy life of self 
indulgence, becomes interesting when carried on with companions. Recognizing the 
difficulty which seems to belong to all institution life, the contrast of its shelter and 
security as compared with the unexpected trials and insecurities of a life of honest 
self support, it is the constant study of the trustees to make the family system of the 
school a preparation for family life outside; to train the girls not only to submit 
to rules, but also to obey conscience when rules are withdrawn. They are taught 
the economies necessary to good housekeeping, they see the little vexations resulting 
from carelessness, and learn what is meant by “duty” and ‘individual responsi- 
bility” as they could not under the restraint found necessary for a more hardened 
class of offenders.

  CCIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The now acknowledged principle that industrial education should be a part of every 
system of reformatory training is stated by Mr. Z. R. Brockway, superintendent of 
the New York State Reformatory, at Elmira, as follows: 
No reformatory system is complete that does not train each subject for a specific 
inidustry for which he has natural adaptation, and actually induct him into it, main- 
taining supervisory control long enough to insure a good degree of permanence and 
success. In spite of all our efforts and because of the limits of the industrial organi- 
zation here, we are obliged to send men, naturally qualified for something better, to 
menial or cheap employment, with which they will not and ought not to be content. 
There is a most intimate connection between the conduct of reformed criminals and 
the readiness with which they.can suitably support themselves. 
The shop work of the Connecticut State Reform Schoo! is reported by the superin- 
tendent, Mr. George E. Howe, as follows: 
We now have three shops where cane seating is done, two being in the main build- 
ing and one at the cottage building. The whole number of boys employed in these 
shops averages about one hundred and seventy-five in the winter season. In the sum- 
mer time there is a less number, as the boys are taken from these shops for the farm, 
garden, and other out-of-door work. 
In the manufacturing room, where overalls are made, we employ about ninety boys. 
Seventy-five boys, seated at as many sewing-machines, at active work, with a large 
class of the little fellows sewing on buttons, folding the goods, keeping the records 
of work, &c., makes a pleasant and interesting sight to behold. The boys in this 
department soon become experts at the machines, and a knowledge of this manufact- 
uring prepares them to obtain ready employment after leaving theschool. We have 
a tailor shop in which twelve boys are employed in the manufacture of the clothing 
worn by the boys. The mending is also done in this shop. Only two boys work in 
the shoe shop. We manufacture but few of the shoes worn, but all of the repairing 
is properly attended to in this shop. 
The Toledo (Ohio) House of Refuge has introduced knitting as one of its industries, 
and the superintendent, Mr. A. A. McDonald, contrasts it with other employments 
very favorably. He says: 
In the [knitting] industry each boy has his machine ; he takes it apart, cleans it, puts 
it together, repairs it, and prides himself on keeping it in perfect order. It to him 
is a machine, and in viewing its parts his mind goes out to stronger and more com- 
plicated machinery ; he discusses its beauty and power; he is improved and benefited. 
In operating a ‘‘ knitter” every muscle of the body rought into play, the mind is 
active in calculations and watchful in giving proper dimensions to articles manufact- 
ured. In every instance, without exception, each boy who goes into the knitting 
factory comes out of it in better health and stronger mentally and physically. In 
the latter industry [brush making] nineteen-twentieths of the boys never can reach 
beyond the hope of being able to sit in cramped positions and fill little perforated 
boards with bristles, in which “trade” no ingenuity is awakened, no lively interest 
manifested. 
         
The usefulness of reform schools is enhanced by facilitating the employment when 
they are discharged of those who have been inmates. There is great danger that the 
correct habits which have been slowly forming will not have taken a sufficient hold 
upon them to keep them from falling into temptation. Itis not easy either to prepare 
such youth for an occupation or to find a place in which they may exercise such skill 
as they possess. These difficulties have not been so great as to prevent the majority 
of those that have gone out from becoming useful men and women. Ninefy-two per 
cent. of the boys paroled from the Newark (N. J.) City Home are “ on tM law and 
order side of life and are thrifty and industrious.” More than 73 per cent. of the 
20,000 children who have been under the care of the refuge at Randall’s Island, near 
New York City, ‘‘ have owed to it their permanent change from the condition of out- 
casts to that of useful citizens.” Similar reports are made by other institutions, and 
there is abundance of proof that the usual result of reformatory education is to prepare 
inmates to meet successfully the duties of life in some honorable pursuit. The atten- 
tion given to industrial training is still insufficient, and it i to be hoped that legisla- 
tures may see the wisdom of promoting it by such means as they are able to command.

REFORMATORY INSTRUCTION. ccv 
THE CONTRACT SYSTEM. 
A committee recently inquired into the truthfulness of charges that cruelty was 
shown to the inmates of the State Reformatory at Elmira, N.Y. They found the 
charges unwarranted; they added to their report some remarks on the administra- 
tion of such institutions. They objected to the contract system of labor for the fol- 
lowing reasons : 
(1) The contract system introduces into the management of the prison the factor of 
private pecuniary interest. The State enters into a contract with private parties to 
furnish them with a specified number of laborers at a fixed price per day for each 
laborer. The contract is likely to be, and in fact is, one requiring, in order to its 
financial success, the employment of a large number of men, and at the ruder, heavier, 
less intelligent, and less desirable forms and kinds of mechanical labor. The prison- 
ers have been employed in the manufacture of shoes of the coarser grade, brushes, 
stoves, and various other forms of hollow ware. These contracts must be strictly 
carried out. The pecuniary interest of the contractor must be a controlling consider- 
ation in connection with the discipline and treatment of the prisoners. No legal 
skill or adroitness can so frame the contract as to exclude from it the element of private 
interest and include in it a paramount regard for the well being and reformation 
of the prisoners ; and, if a contract could be so framed, no sane business man would 
take it. No contractor, not even the very intelligent and estimable gentlemen who 
have contracts with the State for prison labor at Sing Sing and Elmira, some of 
whom appeared before us and testified concerning the operation of the contract 
system, would enter into a contract with the State for the labor of prisoners upon 
any other basis than that of their own financial advantage. 
(2) Under the contract system the prisoners are brought under a divided control: 
the control of the State on the one hand and that of the contractors on the other 
hand; and these will not always agree. The control of the State is, in theory, pa- 
ternal and reformatory ; that of the contractors is, in theory and in fact, purely legal, 
and looks alone to their business success. Such a conflict of interest and purpose 
cannot be otherwise than prejudicial to the discipline of the prison and to the refor- 
mation of the prisoners. ‘The interest of the contractor and the terms of his contract 
may require that certain prisoners shall be employed at a particular kind of work as 
long as practicable, while the interest of the prisoner and the proper conditions of his 
reformation and transformation into an industrious and worthy citizen may require 
that he should be put at a different kind of labor, or even that he should be dis- 
charged from his imprisonment altogether or upon his parole. The interest of the 
contractor requires that his agents and subordinates in the prison should be selected 
with reference to their fitness and skill in supervising and directing the particular 
kind of work to be done under the contract, while the interests of the prisoners and 
the reformatory ends sought by the State require that the men who are put in imme- 
diate supervision of the prisoners should possess other and higher than mere mechan- 
ical and business qualifications. 
(3) A proper classification of the prisoners as to their moral and intellectual status 
and as to their fitness for particular kinds of labor cannot be made under the con- 
tract system. The contract calls for several hundred men to be employed, for in- 
stance, in the manufacture of hollow ware. Among the hundreds so employed there 
must be a large percentage of men whose love of honest remunerative labor willnever 
be stimulated or strengthened by such employment. They will feel their work to be 
onerous and degrading, and will never voluntarily engage in it after their discharge. 
If put at employment suited to their capacity and peculiar adaptations and, so far 
as practicable, to their taste and preference, their self respect might be restored, their 
love of honest work encouraged, and their purposes of reformation confirmed. In- 
stead of smarting continually under a sense of injustice and spurning all induce- 
ments to the amendmentof their lives, as isnow too often the case, they would be made 
to feel tha@the State cherishes a genuine, kindly interest in their welfare ; and unless 
they can be made to feel that the State whose laws they have violated is benign and 
magnanimous, as well as great and powerful to punish, no genuine desire and purpose 
to leada better life can be awakened inthem. Mere power cannot subdue and reform 
thehuman will, and an exhibition of mere vindictiveness only begets the like spirit in 
its victims. 
(4) In order to secure the best reformatory results in prison management, it is im- 
portant that the State should maintain its proper immediate relations with the crimi- 
nals therein confined. The prisoners should be led to see and feel that they are in 
direct contact with the sowereign power which they have disobeyed. This may hum- 
ble, but cannot degrade them. They will respect the majesty of the law. They can- 
not despise, though they may defy it. But the contract system introduces an inter- 
mediary power, and that a purely self interested or mercenary one, between the pris-  
-P-A-G-E-206
ccovt REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
oner and the State. The labor of the prisoner is letor sold by the State with a view 
to the largest pecuniary profit to the State. The prisoner thus finds himself in the 
situation of a hireling, not to say a slave, to serve mere mercenary ends: first, the 
pecuniary advantage of the State, and, second, the pecuniary interest of the con- 
tractor; and the reformatory design of the prison becomes necessarily a subordinate 
and scarcely appreciable factor in the management. 
(5) The inevitable result of the contract system must be and is to prevent the 
introduction into prison management of those reformatory methods and influences 
which are required in order to carry out the design of this institution. Mere labor 
is not in itself and irrespective of other agencies reformatory in its nature. Nor is 
it rendered so by making it remuneratiye, especially if the remuneration is to some 
one other than the laborer. And yet the great State of New York, after proposing to 
itself the grand moral and benevolent purpose of reforming the younger class of its 
criminals and establishing a magnificent prison upon this reformatory basis, and after 
timidly experimenting for the short period of five years on the plan of employing the 
prisoners on its own account, suddenly and apparently from mere pecuniary considera- 
tions reverses its policy, abandons its great humanitarian purpose, and by the act of 
1881, and against the earnest protest of the superintendent and managers, adopts the 
contract system as a part of its reformatory scheme and resolves to transform this great 
charity into a money making institution. Itmay be claimed that the State was wrong 
in founding this prison for reformatory purposes; but if, as we believe, the State was 
right in its original purpose, then, in our judgment, that purpose should be consistently 
carried out with all the energy and resources which the State is accustomed to bring to 
the execution of its will. The question of pecuniary profit or loss in the management of 
» in all cases treated as a matter of secondary consideration, and 
ent to one controlling end of reforming the prisoners therein confined. And 
we are gratified to find that some of the best authorities on prison management in 
this country have given expression to similar views. 
        
PROTECTION OF FOREIGN-BORN CHILDREN, 
Connected with the general subject of juvenile protection and care is the preven- 
tion of the traffic in foreign childyen, and especially in children from Italy, by 
padroni, who gain a livelihood out of the earnings, beggary, and moral ruin of the 
children whose time and labor they contrél. Congress in 1874 passed an act making 
the importation or holding to inyoluntary service of persons kidnapped or inveigled 
in foreign countries, or guilty consent to such importation or retention, a felony 
punishable by fine and imprisonment. Almost at the same time the legislature of 
Pennsylvania passed a law whereby persons hiring, giving, or employing minors under 
eighteen years of age for public minstrelsy, begging, or other mendicant business, and 
persons sharing in any way in the profits of such business, are guilty of a misde- 
meanor punishable by fine and imprisonment. 
The State of Maryland has passed an act similar in purpose to that of the State of 
Pennsylvania; it is an excellent example for all other States to follow, for, though 
driven out of Pennsylvania and Maryland, there is nothing to hinder these cruel and 
lazy child-owners from carrying on their business in other parts of the country, and 
particularly in those places where neither a federal judge nor an Italian consul is to 
be found. This traffic deprives Italy of the civil labor and military service which 
that government under its laws has a right to expect from many of these deported 
youth; it deprives the children themselves of their home, their native country, and 
all regular instruction in morals, behavior, and letters, exposing them in a foreign 
land to all the moral and physical dangers of a strange climate, of oxhfusting and 
unimproving toil, of bad and insufficient food, and of foul lodgings among immoral as- 
sociates, while jealously preventing them from acquiring sufficiently the speech, the 
habits, or the self reliance that they could so easily obtain by a suitable life in this 
country; finally, it afflicts the cities and large towns of this nation with numerous 
ill-used children, who often become thieves, desperadoes, and paupers as they grow 
older: the only persons benefited by all this suffering, injustice, crime, and squalor 
being the ruthless men or women who import these children, live on their earnings, 
and keep them from all hope or desire of anything better.

Avsrnria-HUNGARY.—«a. AUSTRIA, constitutional monarcby: Area, 115,903 square miles ; populatior 
(December 31, 1880), 22,144,244. Capftal, Vienna; population, 1,103,857. Minister of public instruc- 
tion, S. Conrad von Eybesfeld. 
The following information is taken from the Oesterreichische Statistik —Statistik 
der Unterrichts-Anstalten in den im Reichsrathe vertretenen Kénigreichen und 
Liindern fiir das Jahr 1881-82; bearbeitet von der k.-k. Direction der administrativen 
Statistik. ‘ 
Higher instruction.— The number of teachers of all kinds at the different universities 
of Austria in 1881-’82 was as follows: At Vienna, 319; Griitz, 122; Innsbriick, 89; 
Prague, 203; Lemberg, 60 ; Cracow, 96; and Czernowitz, 38—total, 927. Ofthis num- 
ber 328 were regular or ordinary professors, 138 were extraordinary, and the rest were 
Docenten, assistants, special teachers, &c. Seventy of the 927 teachers belonged to 
the theological faculty, 134 to the law faculty, 342 to the medical, and 381 to the phil- 
osophical faculties. The students attending the universities numbered 10,594 in the 
winter and 9,766 in the summer semester. Of these, 11.8 per cent. attended the theo- 
logical faculty, 52.5 per cent. attended the law faculty, 23.8 per cent. the medical, and 
11.9 per cent. the philosophical faculty during the summersemester. As to religious 
belief, 76.3 per cent. of the students were Roman Catholics, 2.9 Greek Orientals, 
3.7 per cent. Evangelicals, 16.6 per cent. Israelites, and 0,5 percent. belonged to other 
faiths. These religions had somewhat different proportions in the population at 
large. Thus, in 1880, the Roman Catholics formed 91.35 per cent. of the total popu- 
lation, the Greek Orientals 2.23, the Evangelicals 1.81, the Jews 4.54, and other con- 
fessions 0.07 per cent. Classified as to native language, 48.9 percent. of the students 
were Germans, 15.5 per cent. Czech-Slayonians, 15.7 Poles, 4.8 Ruthenians, 1.8 Sloven- 
ians, 2.8 per cent. Servians and Croatians, 3.2 per cent. Italians, 1.6 per cent. Rouman- 
ians, 4.5 per cent Magyars, and 1.2 per cent. belonged to other branches. 
There were six higher institutions for technical instruction, with 337 teachers and 
an attendance of 2,699 students in 1881-82. The attendance on these institutions has 
been decreasing in the last few years. The superior agricultural institute in Vienna 
had 16 professors and 23 teachers and Docenten and 511 students in"%1881~’82. The 
two mining academies at Leoben and Pribram have shown increased activity in the 
last few years. They had 29 professors and 188 students in the academic year 
1881~82. 
Secondary and special instruction.— There were six commercial academies, with a total 
attendance of 1,284 persons at the close of the collegiate year. Between the year 
1877-78, when the academies were increased to their present number, and the year 
1881-82 the number of students increased 18.8 per cent. The academies of art at

Jastic year 1881-82. During the same period there were 52 commercial schools, 345 in- 
dustrial schools, 191 singing and music schools, 68 agricultural and forestry schools, 
5 mining schools, 4 veterinary schools, 14 schools of midwifery, 3 naval schools, 282 
work schools for women, and 342 other special institutions. These various institutions 
had, in all, 5,917 teachers and 82,674 students in the year 1881~’82.

Capital, Budapest; population, 360,551. Minister of public instruction, Dr. August von Trefort. 
Primary education.— According to Das ungarische Unterrichtswesen, 1882-’83, the 
number of children of school age in 1882 was 2,215,387, of which number 1,697,984, 
or 76.7 per cent., attended school. The review schools were not so well attended, 
the attendance reaching only 55 per cent. of their school population. Classi- 
fied as to nationality, 44.87 per cent. of the children of school age were Magyars, 
14.60 per cent. were Germans, 17.66 per cent. were Roumanians, 15.88 per cent. 
Slovakians, 2.56 per cent. Servians, 1.87 per cent. Croatians, and 3.06 per cent. Ruthe- 
nians. As regards school attendance, 49.56 per cent. of the pupils were Magyars and 
15.49 Germans, showing a larger proportion of these two nationalities attending 
school than would be expected from their proportion to the school population. The 
other nationalities showed a smaller proportion in attendance than in school popula- 
tion. The total attendance was far from being that required by law, school attend- 
ance being obligatory from the beginning of the eighth to the end of the thirteenth 
year. The number of elementary schools was 16,000, made up of 22,661 class rooms, 
of which only about three-fifths were in the condition required by law. In the last 
twelve years a great number of fine school-houses (nearly 300 a year) have been built 
of stone or brick at the expense of the state, and these and many others compare 
favorably with the school buildings of any other country. But in many small vil- 
lages, especially in Roumania, the school-houses are mere huts, totally unsuited to 
the purposes for which they are used. The regular teachers, male and female, num- 
bered 22,396, and the assistants 3,054. The expenses for primary education in 1882~63 
reached 11,755,625 florins ($4,714,006), 
Secondary instruetion.—There were 150 Gymnasien and 28 Realschulen in the kingdom 
in 1882, with 37,876 students. Of these 71.34 per cent. were Magyars, 15,37 per cent. 
Germans, 6.4 per cent. Roumanians, 1.80 per cent. Servians, 0.44 per cent. Croatians, 
and 0.8 per cent. Ruthenians. The proportions of these nationalities to the pop- 
ulation of the country were different from those just given, and were as follows: 
Magyars, 45.11 per cent.; Germans, 13.15 per cent.; Roumanians, 16.98 per cent.; 
Slovakians, 13.08 per cent.; Servians, 3.01 per cent.; Croatians, 1.97 per cent., and 
Ruthenians 2.50 per cent. The outlay for secondary education was 3,465,997 florins 
($1,389,865). The average annual expense of a student of a Gymnasium supported by 
the state was 98.7 florins ($40), and 76.3 florins ($31) in a Gymnasium belonging to a 
religious denomination. The cost of primary education per child was 6 florins, 40 
kreutzers (about $2.60). 
Superior instruction.— Work on the buildings of the University of Budapest was 
continued in the year 1882-’83. There were 160 professors, of whom 63 were ordinary, 
20 extraordinary, and the rest Docenten and special teachers. They delivered 590 
lectures during the scholastic year 1882-83. At the University of Klausenburg there

were 60 professors, 43 of whom were ordinary or regular, who delivered 250 lectures 
during the year. The appropriation for the University of Budapest was 520,804 
florins ($208,842), and for the University of Klausenburg 189,275 florins ($75,899). 
Special instruction.— The central drawing institute at Budapest had 108 students 
in 188283. It has recently opened a practical course in painting. A superior nor- 
mal school of drawing is annexed to this institute, which granted 17 certificates for 
teachers of drawing in Gymnasien, &c., in 1882~’83.

béeck. 
The following information is taken from the Annuaire statistique de la Belgique 
for 1882. 
Normal and primary instruction.—Up to December 31, 1881, the six normal schools 
for male teachers had 767 students and the eight normal sections had 785 students, 
making a total of 1,552. The six normal schools for young women had an attendance 
of 823 and the seven normal sections an attendance of 727; total, 1,550. The num- 
ber of diplomas issued from the schools for male teachers was 325 and from the schools 
for female teachers 311; total for the year, 636. 
There were 174 nidenia in attendance at the normal achools and seetions for sec- 
ondary instruction during the scholastie year 1881-82. Sixty-three of these were 
young women. 
The number of primary schools in 1881 was—

For these schools there were 5,307 male and 2,990 female lay teachers, no male and 
31 female teachers belonging to some religious order; total, 8,328. The number of 
protective schools for infants in 1881 was 701, with an attendance of 2,142 children 
(only three provinces, recorded). The schools for adults numbered 2,445, of which 
1,925 were for males and 512 for females, 8 being mixed schools. They were attended. 
by 59,268 males and 17,650 females, 76,918 persons in all. Of these only 575 were 
paying students. There were 81 schools under the supervision of the department of 
justice (asylums, prisons, &c.), with a total of both sexes of 6,393 persons under in- 
struction. Of conscripts for the army 19.33 per cent. could neither read nor write in 
1881. In 1882 the proportion was 19.09 per cent. 
On June 30, 1882, a bill was introduced into the Belgian chambers by the govern- 
ment making elementary education obligatory throughout the kingdom. 
Secondary instruction.— Institutions for secondary instruction numbered 130, divided 
into royal athenzxums, 22; secondary schools for young men, 65; the same for young 
Women, 26; and 17 subsidized communal colleges and athenums for young men. 
These secondary schools were attended by 22,947 students in 1881, 3,427 of whom were 
young women. ;

Superior and special instruction.—At the state universities, viz, Ghent and Liége, 
there were, in the scholastic year 1881-’82, 706 and 1,203 students, respectively, and at 
the independent universities of Brussels and Louvain 1,341 and 1,592 students, respect- 
ively. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Antwerp was attended by 1,792 students 
in 1881, Besides the Antwerp academy there were 80 other academies and drawing 
schools in the kingdom in 1881, with a total attendance of 10,488 persons. The royal 
conservatory of music at Brussels had 515 students in 1881; that at Liége had 1,105 
and that at Ghent 584 students. Besides these royal conservatories there were 87 
other conservatories and schools of music, attended by 8,405 students. 
There were five agricultural, horticultural, and veterinary schools, with an attend- 
ance, in the year 183182, of 225 students, and 33 industrial schools, with an attend- 
ance of 9,198 students. To these should be added the industrial and mining school 
at Mons and the superior commercial institute at Antwerp, with 84 and 119 students, 
respectively. The apprentice workshops numbered 52, with 1,029 pupils, of whom 
7.48 per cent. were illiterate. The number of workmen turned out in 1881 was 541. 
DENMARK, constitutional monarchy: Area, 14,553 square miles; population (February, 1880), 1,969,039. 
Capital, Copenhagen ; population, 234, 850. 
Very little information is obtainable respecting the schools of Denmark for 1881~’82. 
It is stated, however, that the educational system is especially well organized. Yet, 
notwithstanding this, there is a vast amount of ignorance among the people, as was 
shown by the examinations in reading, writing, and orthography of the recruits in 
1881. Only about one-third could read correctly, one-third could read a little, while 
the other third read very badly. About one-fifth of the recruits were reperted as able 
to write Danish — yet not in a very correct manner —as orthography seemed to be a 
great stumbling block. The university statistics, however, speak well for the higher 
education of the people. According to the Aarbog for Kj¢benhavns Universitet 
for 1881, there were 1,057 students in attendance in the autumn of 1980 and 867 in 
the early term of 1881. Among the number were a few graduates of previous years 
(1863-1880), who were continuing certain branches of study. Connected with the 
university are the polytechnic institute (107 and 69 studen{g in the terms mentioned), 
school of pharmacy (61 and 52), the agricultural, botanical, and forestry departments 
(9 students each term), and a normal school with 11 pupils in 1880 and 9 in 1881. 
The courses in the university cover theology, jurisprudence, political science, medicine, 
philology, philosophy, mathematics, and natural sciences. At the entrance examina- 
tions in 1881, there were 223 students from the lower schools of Denmark who passed 
successfully. Of these 141 obtained first class certificates, 54 the second grade, 21 
the third, while 7 were classed as ‘remarkably successful.” Six students entered 
the university who had not taken the lower school courses, so that there were 229 
seeking university instruction. 
Copenhagen University is well endowed and has a fine library of nearly 300,000 
volumes and 4,000 manuscripts. The surgical academy, two observatories, a botanical 
garden, and a museum furpish students with varied opportunities for getting an ex- 
cellent education.

A large majority of the people of Finland are Lutherans. In the year 1881 the 
numbers stood as follows: Lutherans, 2,040,535; Greek orthodox, 38,757; Roman 
Catholics, 2,320, The population of Finland is made up of Finns, 1,756,381 (in 1880) ; 
Swedes, 294,876; Russians, 4,195; Germans, 1,720, and 3,610 with no nationality 
given. The Finnish and Swedish tongues are both taught in the schools, Statistics 
of schools for 1881~s2 are presented in the Arsbok fér Finland. The primary grades 
numbered 668, teachers 858, pupils 37,166, or an average of 43to each teacher. Sevene 
lower elementary schools are also reported, with 21 teachers and 266 pupils. There

were 4 seminaries for instructing teachers of the primary grades, with 43 teachers and 
479 pupils. Schools for girls numbered 41, teachers 404, and pupils 3,169. The 19 
Realschulen had 868 pupils, under charge of 135 teachers. Four preparatory depart- 
ments, with 14 teachers and 201 pupils, lead up to the 23 lyceums. These had 3,713 
students and 298 teachers. The Polytechnic Institute at Helsingfors reported courses 
in architecture, engineering, constructing machines, surveying, and chemistry. There 
were 26 teachers and 95 students at the first term of 1883, The university at Hel- 
singfors has four departments, those of theology, law, medicine, and philosophy. 
The professors and lecturers numbered 67 in the early part of 1883, the students 
present 725 (including one woman, in the philosopical course); those on the rolls, 
1,330. The receipts for the university were 980,700 marks; the expenditures, 839,300 
marks,

Taking the various states in alphabetical order the following are the latest avail- 
able educational statisticgof the German empire: 
Alsace-Lorraine.— After the annexation of this territory to Germany in 1871 great 
attention was paid to education by the imperial government. The University of 
Strassburg was opened on May 1, 1872. In 1882 this institution had 104 teachers (64 
of whom were ordinary or regular professors) and 849 students. The library, which 
was destroyed in the bombardment of August 24 and 25, 1870, was replaced as soon 
as possible by a new one of about 400,000 volumes. Higher and lower schools were 
established on the German system, but open to pupils of all religious beliefs without 
distinction. When General von Manteuftel became governor on October 1, 1879, the 
management of the schools passed to a department of the ministry of the interior. 
Since then a series of regulations creating supervisory officers of education in the 
different districts, organizing local school boards, and reorganizing Kindergiirten 
and elementary schools has been issued. In 1882 a superior school council was es- 
tablished as the supreme supervisory body respecting educational affairs, presided 
over by the secretary of state. This superior council busied itself in 1882 with the 
“overpressure” question, in which Alsace-Lorraine took an equal interest with other 
German States. According to Seyffarth’s Chronik des Volksschulwesens, in 1881 
there were 214,657 pupils in the public elementary schools, 6,137 in the free schools, 
37,976 in infant schools, 2,607 in the review schools, 6,368 in the higher girls’ schools, 
and 913 in the middle schools (higher elementary schools), making a total of 268,658, 
These pupils were instructed by 2,725 male and 2,853 female teachers. Of the female 
teachers 61 per cent. and of the male 1.7 per cent. belonged to some religious order. 
Thirty-two per cent. of all the teachers (male and female) were clerical, There were 
+6 teachers’ seminaries for males and 3 for females, and 4 preparatory schoo)s, with 872 
students in 1880. There were 12 Gymnasien, 3 Realgymnasien, 1 Oberrealschule, 
 
-P-A-G-E-218

9 Realschulen, and 5 Realprogymnasien. In 1878 these institutions were attended by 
6,213 students and had 324 teachers. 
Anhalt.— The appropriations for the salaries of teachers increased 200 per cent. in 
ten years and amounted in 1883 to 665,376.64 marks ($158,360). In 1582 there were 
100 teachers at the Gymnasien and Realschulen, 1 female and 15 male teachers at the 
seminary, 30 male and 17 female teachers at the four higher schools for girls, and 543 
male and 91 female teachers at the elementary schools, a total of 797 persons. In 
1881 the number of scholars in the primary schools was 37,147 (an increase of 8 per 
cent. in seven years). In 1882 two Realschulen of the first grade were opened, The 
higher schools for girls were raised in grade and the programs of the ‘middle” 
schools (burgher schools) were also enlarged. 
Baden.—The central authority on school matters is the ministry of the interior, 
which also directly administers the two universities at Heidelberg and Freiburg and 
the Polytechnic Institute at Carlsruhe. All other educational institutions are under 
the supervision of a superior board or council of education, which deals immediately 
with the secondary schools, as the ministry does with the universities. There were 
in 1882 7 Gymnasien, 5 Realgymnasien, 6 complete and 3 incomplete Progymnasien, 
30 higher burgher or city schools modelled after the Prussian system, 37 industrial 
schools, 8 higher schools for girls, 3 teachers’ seminaries for men and 1 for women, 
1 seminary for teachers of gymnastics, 2 institutions for the deaf and dumb, and 1 
blind asylum. The primary schools numbered 1,592 and had 3,238 teachers and 
245,650 scholars. 
Bavaria.— Mr. Joseph W. Harper, United States consul at Munich, prepared a report 
on the school system of Bavaria in 1882, which was transmitted by the Department of 
State to the Bureau of Education. The following is a summary of it: School attend- 
ance iscompulsory in Bavaria, and non-compliance with the law on the part of parents 
or guardians or of persons of school age themselves is punished by fine and imprison- 
ment. Teachers of elementary schools pass through a 3-year course in a preparatory 
school after leaving the elementary schools, then attend a teachers’ seminary for 2 
years, and finally have a 4-year course of practical training and study, after which 
they are required to pass an examination. The minimym amount of pay for male 
teachers of elementary schools ranges from 857.20 marks ($204) a year in districts 
or communes of 10,000 inhabitants to 600 marks ($142.80) in communes of Jess than 
2,500 persons. An assistant gets a minimum of 342.90 marks ($81.61), of which he 
must pay 205.80 marks ($48.98) for board and lodging. In addition to their salaries 
teachers receive a quinquennial advance of 90 marks ($21.42), beginning with the tenth 
year after leaving the seminary. Female teachers receive a minimum of 514,20 
marks ($122.40) and have an increase of pay for long services, like the men. In the 
elementary schools both sexes receive instruction in common where there is only one 
teacher; where there are two or more the government decides whether the separation 
of the school shall be made by class or sex. Where there are more than three teachers 
the highest class is divided according to sex. In all the larger towns a complete 
separation of the sexes has been effected. Children of poor parents are educated 
at public expense. The school age is from 6 to 13 years, inclusive, for elementary 
schools, after which there is a further compulsory attendance of 3 years at the Sun- 
day schools. 
The preparatory schools for teachers had an attendance of 2,464 and the teachers 
seminaries 1,329 students in 1882. The agricultural review schools numbered 1,088 
with 1,412 tonctiens and 14,633 scholars. There were 296 industrial review echinnts: 
with 22,269 students and 1,160 teachers; 4 superior industrial schools, with 309 
students; 5 Realgymnasien, with 480, and 46 Realschulen, with 7,065 students. The 
technological institute had 741 students. The universities had an attendance of 3,664 
students. There were 14 institutions for the deaf and dumb, with 63 teachers and 
573 pupils. The Bavarian teachers’ union numbered 10,084 members. 
Bremen.— The city possesses a high school, which comprises a Gymnasium, Real-
-P-A-G-E-219

gymnasium, and a common preparatory school for both; and 2 Realschulen, besides 1 
each in Bremerhaven and Vegesack. The higher schools for girls are private institu- 
tions. The elementary schools are partly under church control, supported and super- 
intended by the state, and are partly state institutions ; of the latter 5 are public com- 
mon schools, with 3,500 scholars, and 6 charity schools, with 4,000 scholars. There is 
a teachers’ seminary for men; also, a private institution of the same character for 
women. 
- Brunswick.— Brunswick had in 1882 1 superior institute of technology, 5 Gymna- 
sien, 1 Realgymnasium, 1 Realschule, 3 private schools of the grade of a burgher school 
(2 of which were Jewish), 1 school of agriculture, and 1 school of construction. There 
were two public superior schools for girls combined with seminaries for female teach- 
ers. The elementary schools were under the supervision of 44 superintendents and - 
had a teaching force of about 700 persons in 1882. There were 3 seminaries for train- 
ing teachers, 2 reform schools, several orphan asylums, 1 institution for the deaf and 
durab, and 1 institution for the care of idiots. 
ientars — From the report of the board of education for the year 1962-63 we take 
the following figures: In that year Hamburg had 61 public elementary schools, with 
34,847 scholars and 540 male and 247 female teachers. Of the 34,847 children 33,819 
were Lutherans, 352 Reformed, 148 Catholic, and 29 Jews. The teachers’ seminary 
for men had 102 and the teachers’ seminary for women 66 students; there were 2 pre- 
paratory schools for teachers, with 111 male and 94 female students: giving a total of 
373 individuals studying the profession of teaching. The Wilhelm Gymnasium had 
203 students, the Realschule 531, the higher burgher school 388, and the Johanneum 
school 633 students. Preparatory schools for these higher institutions had a total 
attendance of 534 scholars. The poorhouse school had an attendance of 95; the 
orphan asylum school, 462; the institute for the deaf and dumb, 65; and 47 other fan 
lic schools had an atlendasies of 6,623 in all. The total public school attendance was 
44,381 persons. There were 27 church, foundation, and association schools, with 7,780 
children in attendance. There were 129 private schools of all kinds, with an attend- 
ance of 14,453. The total of all persons receiving instruction was 66,614. 
Tiibeck.— At the close of the year 1881~82 Liibeck and its suburbs had 76 schools, 
with 11,478 children and 211 male and 163 female teachers, This number includes 
the Catharineum, the higher burgher school, the business school, the navigation 
school, the industrial art school, all the public elementary schools, church and charity 
schools, and private schools of all kinds. 
Mecklenburg-Schwerin.—This duchy had 6 Gymnasien, 6 Realgymnasien, 1 Progym- 
nasium, 1 Realschule, and 4 higher burgher schools in 1882-83. In 1877 the number of 
public elementary schools was 1,389, together with 55 burgher and city schools. There 
was 1 institution for the blind, 1 for the deaf and dumb, and 1 for the feeble-minded. 
The business review schools numbered 45. The ini nitty of Rostock had 42 ean 
ers and 236 students in the winter of 1882-83. 
Mecklenburg-Strelitz had 3 Gymnasien, 2 Realschulen, 2 higher schools for girls, 1 sem- 
inary, and 233 county and 12 city schools. 
Prussia.— The number of elementary primary schools in Prussia in 1882 was 33,040. 
Sixty-nine per cent. of these schools had only 1 teacher each. As to religious belief 
22,821 schools, having 2,723,911 children and 39,106 teachers, were evangelical; 9,45: 
schools, having 1,405,989 children and 17,429 teachers, were Roman Catholic; 250 
schools, with 10,037 children and 310 teachers, were Hebrew; and 517 schools, with 
199,792 children and 3,072 teachers, were schools where children of different beliefs 
received instruction incommon. The total number of children in school was 4,339,729, 
and the number of instructors 59,917. For preparing teachers there were 103 seminaries 
for males and 8 for females in 1882~83 and the attendance was 9,955. In 1870 the 
number of seminaries was 79 for males and 3 for females, with an attendance of 5,000. 
Prussia had 249 Gymnasien, 33 Progymnasien, 89 Realgymnasien, 12 upper Realschulen, 
78 Realprogymnasien, 16 Realschulen, and 23 higher burgher schools. The Gymnasien

and Progymnasien enrolled 77,260 students in 1879, all the Realschulen about 50,000. 
Of the 127,260 over 90,000 were evangelical, about 22,500 were Catholic, and 13,000 
Jews. There were in 188217 agricultural schools of an intermediate or secondary 
grade (below the agricultural institutes connected with the university), and -53 of a 
lower grade.

In 1881 there were 51 institutes for the deaf and dumb, with 301 teachers and 3,629 
students. 
Saxony.—In 1881 the number of schools in Saxony was 2,205, with 6,551 teachers 
(only 350 of whom were women) and 488,680 scholars—16.4 per cent. of the total popu- 
lation. The review schools numbered 1,832 and had an attendance of 71,114 persons. 
There were 12 Gymnasien, with 355 teachers and 5,098 students; 11 Realschulen of the 
first order, with 216 teachers and 2,779 students; 22 Realschulen of the second order, 
with 236 teachers and 3,023 students, and 19 seminaries, with 271 teachers and 2,596 
students. 
The University of Leipzig had 177 professors and teachers and 3,317 students. The 
Polytechnicum at Dresden had 51 professors and teachers and 371 students. There were 
557 pensioned teachers, including 4 women, The mining academy, at Freiberg, had 19 
teachers and 122 students, and the 2 mining schools had 8 teachers and 87 students. 
These institutions, together with the forestry school, are under the minister of finance. 
Under the minister of war are the cadet school at Dresden, with 21 teachers and 160 
students (in 1881~82) ; the subaltern school, at Marienberg, with 13 teachers and 400 
students; the school for soldiers’ sons, at Struppen, with 2 teachers and 80 scholars, 
and 5 garrison schools, with 6 teachers and 106 students. The minister of the inte- 
rior has control of the art academy at Dresden, with 23 teachers and 123 students; 
the art industrial school, at Leipzig, with 13 teachers and 196 students; the art 
industrial school at Dresden, with 19 teachers and 212 students; the technological in- 
stitute at Chemnitz, with 40 teachers and 447 students; and 44 industrial and review 
schools, with 309 teachers and 6,127 scholars. The conservatories of music at Leip- 
zig and Dresden were attended by 985 students and had 101 teachers in 1881~82. 
Besides these institutions there were 15 fitting schools for trade, with 94 teachers 
and 1,536 students, and schools for preparing boys for special vocations, such as sea- 
faring, architecture, agriculture, &c. 
Wiirttemberg.— On January 1, 1882, there were 4,158 primary school teachers in 
Wiirttemberg, of whom 2,890 were evangelical and 1,263 Catholic. In 17 cities there are

so-called elementary schools, which receive boys of six years of age and give them in- 
struction until they enter the Gymnasien. These schools numbered 18 in 1881 and had 
58 teachers and 2,482scholars. ‘There were 11 higher schools for girls, with 3,299 pu- 
pils, 106 male and 98 female teachers. The number of public secondary schools numbered 
92, of which 4 were lower evangelical theological seminaries, 12 were Gymnasien, 8 
lyceums, and 68 lower Latin schools. These institutions had 406 established principal 
teachers and 9,257 students. Of the latter, 6,716 were evangelical, 2,134 Catholics, and 
396 Jews. There were 74 public Realschulen, including the burgher school at Stutt- 
gart, with 268 teachers and 6,629 scholars. The seminary for teachers of higher 
schools for girls at Stuttgart had 41 students and 14 teachers, 12 of whom were men. 
The art school at Stuttgart had 11 teachers and 69 students in 1881, and the con- 
servatory of music had 610 students at the same time. The Polytechnikum in Stutt- 
gart had 65 teachers and assistants in 1881 and 410 students. The school of archi- 
tecture at Stuttgart had 41 teachers and assistants and 448 students. There were 
153 industrial review schools, with an attendance of 9,600 scholars and 735 teachers, 
and 28 industrial schools for girls and women, with a total attendance of 3,182 per- 
sons. The agricultural institute at Hohenheim had 21 teachers and assistants in 
1881 and 72 students. The veterinary school at Stuttgart had 13 teachers and assist- 
ants and 60 students. The farm schools at Ellwangen, Ochsenhausen, and Kirchberg 
had 12 students each. The school of viticulture at Weinsberg had 15 students, 5 
agricultural winter schools had 89 students, and the various other evening and win- 
ter agricultural schools numbered 883 and had an attendance of 20,100 persons. 
The University of Tiibingen had 106 professors and assistants and 1,401 students in 
1882. 
The Knabenhort.— The Prussian minister of the interior, in a circular dated April 10, 
1883, called the attention of the provincial authorities to an association called the 
Knabenhort which has existed in Munich since 1881. The object of this association 
is to place boys of school age who are sons of poor parents in charge of suitable per- 
sons during part of the time they are not in school, and give them some useful occu- 
pation, such as wood working, &c., or amuse them in a way to stimulate and develop 
their understanding and sensibilities. The boys in this way become accustomed to 
habits of obedience, order, industry, and cleanliness and are kept from the influences 
of bad company. Of the objects of the association, the first report says: 
The homes of many poor people are left deserted on work days until evening, and 
when their children come out of school there is no dne to take care of them, so that 
they are exposed to the dangers which come from bad company or from being left to 
themselves. So also many poor widows heroically devote themselves to work for their 
own and their children’s support. They are compelled for the most part to work far 
from home during the day, and they return at night filled with anxiety lest some 
bodily or moral harm has come to their children during their absence. The conviction 
is constantly spreading that indifference to these circumstances on the part of the 
public will tend to aggravate the social evils which spring from them, and it is from 
such considerations as these that the Knabenhort was established. 
Notwithstanding its recent origin this association has received such support as to 
enable it to open two places for its purposes in Munich. 
In his circular the minister points out that the Kindergirten and similar schools 
exercise a very salutary influence, but that their scope is limited to infants not yet 
old enough to attend the public elementary schools, while the danger of leaving 
pupils of the latter schools to themselves after school hours is equally to be avoided. 
Moreover, the expenses of such a society asthe one at Munich are small, the subscrip- 
tion in that city being only one mark, and yet the Knabenhort has been able to take 
care of over a hundred boys in less than two years. The minister recommended 
the formation of similar societies whenever local circumstances made it desirable. 
The circular also states that the boys are admitted at 2 o’clock Wednesday and Sat- 
urday afternoons and at 4on-other work days. They only get bread to eat in the 
Munich Knabenhort, because the popular schools of that city have kitchens attached, 
where the poor children can get both bread and soup.

OOXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Similar institutions have since been started in Hanover, Fiirth, and Bamberg, 
while Nuremberg also reports in favor of a Knabenhort. As far back as 1829 Darm- 
stadt undertook to look after her boys out of school hours, and now between 400 and 
500 boys are cared for. Erlangen, Batimenheim, Augsburg, and Dresden have had 
like establishments under way in past years. In some of these “refuges for boys” 
soup and meat are given at noon. At Hanover each boy is given a plot of ground to 
cultivate. At present 25 boys are learning, under charge of 2 instructors, to hoe, 
chop, plant, water flowers, keep paths clean, &c. The fruits or vegetables raised 
may be carried off for home consumption. In wet weather indoor industries are . 
taught, and already a straw matting has been made for the shop floor. Whether all 
these institutions are called ‘Knabenhort”? is not stated, but the plan is said tobe 
the same.

35,241,482. a, EXGLAND AND WALES. Population, 25,974,439. Capital, London; population, 4,766,661, 
The following information regarding elementary education is compiled from the 
report of the committee of council on education for the year ending August 31, 1882, 
signed by Lord Carlingford and Mr. Mundella: 
Day schools.—Number of day schools inspected, 18,289; number of certificated 
teachers, 35,444, with a Jarge number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommoda- 
tion for 4,538,320 scholars; enrolled, 4,189,612; average daily attendance, 3,015,151; 
present on the day of inspector’s visit 3,542,742; qualified by attendance for exam- 
ination, 2,943,114; presented for examination, 2,780,430, viz, 661,056 (being under 7 
years of age) for collective and 2,119,374 (7 and above) for individual examination. 
Of these last, 1,378,175 passed the prescribed test without failure in any one of the 
three subjects, viz, reading, wriving, and arithmetic. 
These figures show improvement upon the returns quoted in 1881, as follows: While 
the increase of the population during the year is estimated at 1.35 per cent., the ac- 
commodation has increased by 148,687 school places (or 3.39 per cent.); the scholars 
on the registers, by 144,250 (3.57 per cent.); the average attendance, by 151,616 (5.29 
per cent.); and the number of children individually examined, by 123,676 (or 6.2 per 
cent. ). 
Since 1870 the provision in schools visited by the inspectors has risen from 1,878,584, 
or 8.75 per cent. of the population, to 4,538,320, or 17,24 per cent. of the population. 
Of this total increase of 2,659,736 school seats, no fewer than 705,868 have been required 
to meet the growth of the population. The rest, or nearly 2,000,000 seats, may be 
taken as the measure of the deficiency which existed at the passing of the education 
act, 
Night schools.— Number examined, 1,015; average attendance, 33,135. 
Training colleges.—Number, 41 ; attendance, 3,121. 
Income and expenditures,—The total income of day and night schools was 5,566,8041. 
The total cost of maintenance of day and night schools was 5,572,8201., an increase of 
235,8417. over the same for 1881. 
ren accommodation and attendance.— On the usual assumption that six-sevenths of 
the population are of the class whose children ought to attend public elementary 
schools, one-fifth of the whole population might be found in the registers of the schools, 
and seats should be provided for one-sixth of the population, which seats ought to be 
daily occupied. With the estimated population for 1882 (viz, 26,325,376), this would 
give 5,265,075 on the school registers and 4,387,562 in average daily attendance, where- 
as the returns show 4,189,612 children on the registers and 3,015,151 in attendance. 
The actual provision of school places, while somewhat in excess of the number re- 
quired, is not evenly distributed, so that in several counties there is marked deficiency 
of accommodation. 
  
1A Berlin society is to be started early in 1884 for the express purpose of establishing similar places 
for girls: that is, Midchenhort.
-P-A-G-E-223
  
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXXHI 
The average daily attendance, it will be seen, falls below the required number by 
above one and a quarter million. Improvement in this respect will, it is thought, be 
very rapid under the new code, which makes it, more than ever, the interest of all con- 
cerned in the efficiency of each inspected school to increase the average yearly attend- 
ance by diminishing daily irregularities. 
Infants.— Of the day scholars on the school registers 416,126 were under 5 years of 
age and 898,483 were between 5 and 7. The provision which in many districts was 
specially needed, and has been supplied of late years, for the separate accommoda- 
tion of infants, will, it is to be hoped, materially increase the number of this latter 
Glass of scholars. ‘The methods of instruction for children over and under 7 years of 
age are very different, and cannot be efficiently carried on in the same room. Every 
scho81, therefore, except the very smallest, requires a separate department for infants, 
and the new code contains special provisions for securing that proper arrangements 
are made for the purpose. Of the 863,817 infants in average attendance during the 
last year, 565,224 were found in infant schools, 139,746 in infant classes of mixed. 
schools under schoolmisiresses, and as many as 158,847 in similar classes under the 
very unsuitable charge of male teachers. 
Scholars over 7 years of age.— The following table shows the classification of children 
over 7 for each standard:

Whereas, out of 2,119,374 scholars examined individually, as many as 1,062,625, 
being over 10 years of age, ought to have been presented in standards IV-VI, only 
591,238 were so presented, while 471,387 (or 44.36 per cent.) were presented in stand- 
ards suited for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
There has been, however, a gradual improvement in this respect, which is due partly 
to the more regular attendance and increased proficiency of the children between 5 
and 10 years of age and partly to the greater attention paid by teachers to the prog- 
ress of individual scholars, in consequence of a provision of the codes of late years 
which made the payment of certain grants depend upon the proportion of scholars ex- 
amined in the three upper standards. That proportion has risen from 17.96 in 1872 
to 28.26 per cent. 
Class subjects and specific subjects.— For class subjects grants were made in respect of 
an average attendance of 1,878,987 scholars, of whom 1,514,446 were paid for passes 
in two subjects. Tho number examined in specific subjects was 185,157, of whom 
137,671 passed successfully, 50,953 of them in two subjects and 1,287 in three subjects. 
In this class were comprised 59,812 girls examined in domestic economy. 
Miscellaneous.— Military drill is systematically taught to the boys attending 1,157 
day schools. Cookery is taught in 347 schools, or in 48 more than in 1881. Savings 
banks have been established in 1,376 and school libraries in 2,603 schools. Singing 
is taught in 26,681 departments of schools, the instruction being given by ear in 
22,352. 
With the view of encouraging the study of scientific subjects in training colleges, 
it has of late years been arranged that success in the examinations in science held by 
the Science and Art Department should be taken into account in determining the 
students’ places in the class list of candidates for teachers’ certificates. From the 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
CCXXIV. REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
record of the Christmas examinations it appears that 1,357 male students wereexamined 
in one or more subjects, the total number of passes being 1,915; the number of female 
students was 1,245; number of passes reported for them, 511. 
Languages now enter into the course of study in all the training colleges for masters 
and in several of those for mistresses. At Christmas last 1,122 papers were worked 
by male students and 465 by female students. Of the papers presented 1,122 were in 
the French language, 463 in the Latin, and 2 in the Greek. 
Salaries.—The average salary of a certificated master, which in 1870 was 951. 12s. 
9d., is now 1191. 15s. 6d.; that of a schoolmistress was 571. 16s. 5d, in 1870 and is now, 
721. 0s. 11d. In addition to their other emoluments, 6,194 out of 14,255 masters and 
5,393 out of 20,094 mistresses are provided with residences free of rent; these averages 
are calculated upon the whole of the certificated teachers, whether principal or akist- 
ants. 
The number of female pupil teachers in 1869 was 7,273; they now number 19,433, 
an increase of 167 per cent. The male pupil teachers, who numbered 5,569 in 1869, 
have increased to 8,852, or by about 59 per cent. 
Pensions.— The education department has received during the school year 140 ap- 
plications on behalf of teachers in England and Wales satisfying the required condi- 
tions, and has awarded 5 pensions of 251. and 5 of 201., together with 12 gratuities to 
the amount of 3601. 
Education in London.—From the annual statement of the chairman of the board, Mr. 
Edward North Buxton, it appears that the number of places required in efficient ele- 
mentary schools, December, 1882, was 641,428, while the number provided was 539,044, 
A practical proof of the deficiency here indicated, Mr. Buxton observes, is found in 
the number of children who are still refused admission in the growing districts. He 
recommends, as in previous years, the purchase of sites for school-houses in anticipation 
of the demand in rapidly growing districts. The report of the by-laws committee for 
the half year ending midsummer, 1883, gives as the total accommodation 557,984; av- 
erage number on the roll, 530,697; average attendance, 431,467. As compared with 
1871, these figures show that in all efficient schools the number of school places has in- 
creased by 295,725— that is, by 112.7 per cent.; that the number on the roll has increased 
by 308,179—that is, by 138.4 per cent. ; and that the average attendance has increased 
by 257,166—that is, by 147.5 percent. Attention is drawn to the fact that the percent- 
age of average attendance as compared with the average number on the roll is higher 
in this report than in any previous report, not only for the whole metropolis, but also 
both in board and voluntary schools. This percentage for the whole metropolis is 
81.3; for board schools, 82.0 per cent.; and for voluntary schools, 80.2 per cent. The 
committee, however, would point out that the board must not expect this proportion 
to be maintained in future, for the following reason: The board schools have been in 
the habit every week of clearing their rolls of children who have been absent for two 
weeks. A regulation of the education department, which the boards have been com- 
pelled to follow, lays it down that the roll of all public elementary schools should 
only, except in certain specified cases, be cleared of children who have been absent for 
six weeks. In future, therefore, the number on the roll as compared with the average 
attendance will, at all events in the board schools, appear to be greater than has 
hitherto been the case. 
The whole number of schools under the board, viz, 324, shows the number of chil- 
dren in each standard in the week ending March 22, 1883, as follows: : 
Total number in and percentage of each standard, the enumeration being taken 
just before the Easter holidays, when the attendance is always low:

The report of the government examinations for the year ending March, 1883, shows 
for 110 schools the following results: 
-- 91.9 
89.3 
-- 86.0 Percentage of passes in reading... 
Percentage of passes in writing 
Percentage of passes in arithmetic.    
  The income of 120 schools, for which the reports of the government inspectors were 
received for the same year, was 226,8241. 10s. 7d., all of which was absorbed in the 
expenditure. 
. The gross average cost per child in average attendance in 110 schools reported upon 
for the entire year was 21. 15s. 104d., and the net cost 11. 11s, The fees charged in the 
schools average about 2s. 2d. per week. The gross amount collected from this source 
for the year ending September 29, 1882, was 100,000/. The expenditures of the board 
for the fiscal year 1881-’82 were 921,642I. 2s. 11d. The rates for 1881-’82 were 6.15d.; 
for 1882-83, 5.934. 
For the year ending September 29, 1882, there were in the service of the board 837 
head teachers, 2,821 assistant teachers, 1,078 pupil teachers, and 468 candidates. The 
average salary of head teachers was 2021. 2s. 9d.; that of assistants, 1020. 158. 4d. A 
proposal of the school management committee recommending that the teachers be 
paid fixed salaries will undoubtedly be adopted by the board. 
The number of blind children on the rolls 22d of March, 1883, was 105. They re- 
ceived special instruction in 33 classes, which included from 1 to 13 children each. 
The number of deaf and dumb children on the rolls was 191 and their average 
attendance was 128. With reference to their instruction the superintendent observes: 
The oral system, which teaches all deaf children speech by means of speech, to the 
entire exclusion of manual signs, is undoubtedly the best system, and efforts are now 
being made to carry it out to its fullest extent in all the classes. It has been consid- 
ered desirable under the present arrangements to make the average as near as possible 
ten children in each class, and to keep the classes separate and distinct. The difti- 
culty of obtaining qualified teachers in the oral system still continues, the few who 
are trained at the Ealing College being eagerly sought after as private governesses, 
‘Twenty-three cookery centres were open during the half year; all girls in stand- 
ards V and YI in schools where domestic economy is taken as a specific subject have 
beén required to attend a course of twenty lessons in practical cookery; also, girls 
over twelve years of age, not in the upper standards, have to make twenty attend. 
ances at a cookery centre. 
The superintendent of method in infants’ schools points out the need of increased 
material and better accommodation for the training of young children. 
The reports of the instructor in drill and the superintendent of the physical edu- 
cation of girls show progress in both these departments. 
In 1882 the number of schools saving penny banks in co:ynection with the post office 
was 30. 
Industrial school cases.—Under this head Mr. Buxton observes: 
Since 1870 7,566 children and during the past three years 2,231 children have been 
sent to industrial schools. The convictions for juvenile crime are now only half what 
they were in 1870. The obvious connection between these figures justifies me in 
placing them together. It is now difficult for a child in the company of thieves, or 
otherwise likely to adopt a life of crime, to escape the knowledge of one or other of our 
industrial school officers; and if, on investigation, his ease is found to be a suitable 
one, hé is removed from a position where he is in danger himself and likely to become 
dangerous to the community, and placed where there is a reasonable chance of his 
becoming a useful member of society. During the past three years 4,580 of such cases 
have been considered by the committee, 3,675 have been taken. before the magistrates, 
and 2,231 have been sent to industrial schools. * * * The appointment ofa royal 
commission to inquire into the whole subject of industrial schools is a satisfaction to 
all of us, as we may confidently hope that the weak points of the system will be ex- 
posed without the destruction of so valuable an aid in arresting the sources of crime. 
J also trust that one result will be to give more prominence to the educational and 
less to the penal side of these institutions.

CCXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
b. SCOTLAND: Population, 3,735,573. Capital, Edinburgh; population, 236,002. , 
The following summary is compiled from the report of the committee of council of 
education in Scotland for the year 1882, signed by Lord Carlingford and Mr. Mun- 
della. 
Day schools.— Number of day schools inspected, 3,073; number of certificated teach- 
ers, 5,728, with a large number of assistants and pupil teachers; accommodation for 
619,086; enrolled, 555,660; average daily attendance, 421,265; present on day of in- 
spector’s visit, 490,372; qualified by attendance for examination, 413,266; presented 
for examination, 374,957, viz, 54,207 (under 7) for collective and 320,750 (7 and 
over) for individual examination; of these last, 243,814 passé. the prescribed test 
without failure in any one of the three subjects. © 
Since 1872 the provision in aided schools has risen from 281,668, or 8.3 per ante of 
the population, to 619,086, or 16.4 per cent. of the population. 
Of the total increase of 337,418 seats, some 63,260 have been required to meet the 
growth of the poptilation during the last ten yeats. The rest, or upwards of 274,000 
seats, may be taken as the measure of the deficiency in inspected schools at the pass- 
ing of the education act. 
Night schools.— Number examined, 221; average attendance, 11,904. 
Training colleges.— Number, 7; attendance, 850. 
Income and expenditure.— The total income of day and night sthools was 878,5061. ; 
total cost of maintenance of day and night schools, 873,9181., an increase of 11,1441. 
over the same for 1881. 
School accommodation and attendance.—It is stated that, when the outstanding build- 
ing grants have been paid and several schools now in the coutse of erection without 
such aid are occupied, the school supply of the country will be virtually complete. 
School attendance is still far below the required number, for, whereas there might 
be 755,072 scholars on the registers and 629,227 in average daily attendance, the re- 
turns show only 555,660 children on the registers and 421,265 in attendance. 
This deficiency in school attendance has caused the department to make special in- 
quiries 48 to the manner in which the school boards carry out their compulsory pow- 
ers. They have also presented a bill in Parliament with a view of facilitating the ex- 
ercise of those compulsory powers. 
Infanis.— Out of a total of 114,267 children from 4 to 7 years of age enrolled upon 
the school registers, there was an average attendance of 81,087; of these, only 
25,987 were instructed in infant schools proper, 10,454 in the lower classes of mixed 
schools under schoolmistresses and as many as 44,646 in similar classes under male 
teachers, who, unless assisted, as they sometimes are, by competent fernale teachers, 
are obviously quite unsuited for such a charge. 
Scholars above 7 years of age.-— Whereas, out of 320,750 scholars examined, as many 
as 162,057, being over 10 years of age, ought to have been presented in standards 
IV-VI, only 114,699 (or 70.78 per cent.) were so presented, whilé the remaining 47,358 
were presented in standards suited for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
Specific subjects.— Of 58,210 scholars presented in subjects beyond the standard ex- 
amination, 2,805 passed in three subjects, 24,190 in two subjects, and 23,088 in one. 
In this class were comprised 25,367 girls examined in domestic economy, of which 
num ber 20,078 passed. 
Miscellaneous.— Military drill is systematically taught to the boys ited dliey 258 
schools; cookery is taught in 40 schools; savings banks have been established in 94 
and school libraries in 136 schools. In 3,082 departments of schools in which singing 
is taught, the instruction is given by ear in 1,222, or 39.65 per cent. 
Teaching power.—The number of students in training colleges who presented them- 
selves at the examinations of the Science and Art Department was: men, 298; women, 
217. For the former, 299 passes are reported ; for the latter, 58. The extent to which 
the training colleges have contributed to the existing supply of certificated teachers 
‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXXVII 
in Scotland is shown by the fact that, of 3,211 masters employed in schools reported on 
last year, 1,929, or 60.08 per cent., had been trained for two years; 323, or 10.06 per 
cent., for one year, and 98, or 3.05, for less than one year, while 861, or 26.81 percent., 
were untrained. In like manner, of 2,517 schoolmistresses, 1,734, or 68.89 per cent., 
had been trained for two years; 122, or 4.85 per cent., for one year; 8, or .32 percent., 
for less than one year, and 653, or 25.94 per cent., were untrained. Of the teachers, 
however, who, from whatever cause, have not attended a training college, a consider- 
able proportion cannot, except in a technical sense of the word, be classed as un- 
trained, having under the superintendence of some of the best teachers satisfactorily 
completed the pupil@eachers’ course and served as assistants in large schools before 
passing the examination for a certificate and undertaking independent charges. 
The system introduced by the code of 1873 of combining attendance at university 
classes with the efficient course of practical professional training provided by the col- 
leges under inspection, is now producing very satisfactory results. All the training 
colleges for masters are now availing themselves of this provision of the code. 
Salaries and pensions.—The average salary of a certificated master, which was in 
1870 1107. 16s. 7d., is now 1361. 8s. 7d.; that of a schoolmistress was 551. 14s. 2d. in 
1870 and is now 671. 10s. 10d. During the year the department has received 11 appli- 
cations for pensions on behalf of teachers in Scotland. Since the practice of granting 
pensions was resumed in 1875, 117 Scotch applications have been dealt with, and the 
department has granted 5 pensions of 301., 19 of 251., and 26 of 201., and 18 gratuities 
to the amount of 6501. 
IRELAND: Population, 5,174,836. Capital, Dublin; population, 249,602. 
From the report of the commissioners of national education in Ireland it appears that 
the number of schools on the operation list on the 31st of December, 1882, was 7,705. 
During the year 72 schools were dropped or ceased to exist as independent schools 
and 129 were brought into operation, giving a net increase of 57 schools as compared 
with 1881. 
The total number of pupils on the rolls between the Ist of January and the 31st of 
December who made at least one attendance was 1,083,298; the number of pupils 
on the rolls who made at least one attendances within the last fortnight of the results 
period was 678,970; the average daily attendance was 469,192, an increase of 15,625 
as compared with that of 1881. 
School accommodation, allowing 8 square feet for each pupil, was adequate for an 
attendance of 670,178. 
Mixed schools.—The total number of mixed schools under Roman Catholic teachers 
exclusively was 2,750, attended by 358,342 Roman Catholic pupils and 22,458 Prot- 
estant pupils; the total number of mixed schools under Protestant teachers exclu- 
sively was 1,283, attended by 24,316 Roman Catholic and 128,812 Protestant pupils. 
The number of mixed schools under Roman Catholic and Protestant teachers con- 
jointly was 86, attended by 10,331 Roman Catholic pupils and 10,069 Protestant pupils. 
Total mixed schools, 4,119 ; total attendance, Roman Catholic pupils, 392,989; Prot- 
estant pupils, 161,339. * 
Unmixed schools.— Of 3,501 schools showing an unmixed attendance, 2,907 were in 
charge of Roman Catholic teachers and attended by 462,481 Roman Catholic pupils 
and 594 were in charge of Protestant teachers and attended by 65,922 pupils. 
Model schools.—The nuriber of model schools reported is 26, having an average daily 
attendance of 8,692 pupils. 
Workhouse schools.—The number of workhouse schools in connection with the board 
on the 3ist of December, 1882, was 160, having an enrolment of 14,382 and an aver- 
age daily attendance of 7,709. 
Examinations— The total number of distinet schools examined for results during 
the year was 7,648, including 64 evening schools. The number of pupils examined 
was 491,440, of whom 115,370 were infants. The number passed was 372,967, includ-

ing 194,752 infants. The number of pupils examined and passed in extra subjects 
was as follows: Music, examined, 53,474; passed, 40,099. Drawing, examined, 23,210; 
passed, 17,028. Other extra subjects, viz, mathematics, physical science, language, 
domestic economy, &c., examined, 27,782; passed, 17,950. 
Comparative view.—The percentages of passes gained in reading, writing, and 
arithmetic in Ireland, as compared with England and Wales and with Scotland, are 
set forth in the following table:

  Treland. | ands Walon Scotland. 
92.9 92.3 
94.7 89.3 
76.6 85.1    School farms and gardens.— The total number of school farms in connection with the 
board on the 31st December, 1882, was 73, of which 71 were examined during the 
year, and special results fees for agriculture were granted upon the answering of the 
pupils. The total number of pupils examined in agriculture in this class of schools 
was 965, of whom 709 passed in the agricultural program. 
Thé commissioners had also 19 schools having school gardens attached, for the 
management of which and for the agricultural knowledge displayed by the pupils 
special agricultural fees were granted upon the reports of the district inspectors. ' 
‘The number of pupils examined in the school gardens last year was 257, of whom 118 
passed, 
The number of pupils examined in agriculture by the district inspectors in the 
ordinary national schools at the results examination was 44,493, of whom 21,135 
passed. The total number of pupils examined in agriculture during the year 1882 
(including the pupils of ordinary agricultural schools and school gardens referred to 
above) was accordingly 45,715, of whom 21,962 gained passes for their proficiency in 
that branch. These figures show that a larger number of pupils were brought under 
instruction in agriculture in 1882 than in 1881. 
Teaching power.— There were in the service on 31st December, 1882, 7,497 principal 
teachers and 3,035 assistants, making in the whole 10,532 classed teachers, of whom 
3,491 were trained. In addition to these there was a large number of paid monitors, 
temporary assistants, &c. The total number of teachers and students trained in 
1882 was 161, viz, 70 males and 91 females. 
The total number trained from the commencement of the proceedings of the com- 
missioners up to 31st December, 1882, was 10,875. 
The total income of the teaching staff from all sources for the year ending March, 
1883, amounted to 746,5861. 4s. 9d., viz, 600,2931. 15s. 7d. from the board, 11,9061. 7s. 1d. 
from the rates, and 134,3861. 2s. 1d. from payment by pupils (including portion of 
model school fees), subscriptions, and the estimated value of free residences, &c. Of 
the total sum 19.6 per cent. was locally provided and 80.4 per cent. was derived from 
the parliamentary fund. 
Pensions.—The number of teachers connected with the pension fund in the year end- 
ing the 31st December, 1882, was 4,927, and the amount paid in pensions was 9,552I. 
17s. 9d. and in gratuities 8,1397. 8s, 8d. 
Income and expenditure.—The funds at the disposal of the commissioners for the year 
ending 31st of March, 1883, amounted to 829,9381. 2s, 5d. The expenditures by the 
com ioners for the same time were 803,109J. 8s. 3d., leaving a balance on 31st of 
March, 1883, of 26,8281. 14s. 2d. 
Progress of national education.—The per cent.. for all Ireland of children 5 years 
old and upwards who could neither read nor write was, in 1881, 25.2, being a re- 
duction in illiteracy of 8.2 as compared with the year 1871, the greatest reduction ’ °

EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, CCXXIX 
attained in any consecutive decade. The commissioners submit that this improve- 
ment affords the most satisfactory evidence of the progress of national education 
within the last ten years. The percentage of illiteracy of those who were 15 and 
under 20 years of age—a section of the population for whose education the national 
system might, to a certain extent, be held responsible— was, in 1861, 27.3; in 1871, 
17.5; and in 1881, 12.4. 
Science and art department.—The following information is derived from the report of 
the Science and Art Department, whose operations embrace the United Kingdom : 
The numbers of pergpns who, during the year 1882, have attended the schools and 
glasses of science and art in connection with the department are as follows, viz: 
68,581 attending science schools and classes in 1882, as against 61,177 in 1881, and 
909, 216 receiving instruction in art, showing a decrease upon the previous year of 
481. é 
At the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines there were 39 regular 
and 178 occasional students ; at the chemical department science schools, 78 students ; 
at the metallurgical laboratory, 31 students; at the Royal College of Science for 
Ireland there were 24 associate or regular students and 61 occasional students. 
The lectures delivered in the lecture theatre of the South Kensington Museum were 
attended by 5,207 persons; the evening lectures to workingmen atthe Royal School 
of Mines were attended by 1,732 persons, being 260 more than last year; and 256 
science teachers attended the special courses of lectures provided for their instruction 
in the new science schools at South Kensington. 
The various eourses of lectures delivered in connection with the department in 
Dublin were attended by about 766 persons. The total number of persons who, 
during the year 1882, attended the different institutions and exhibitions in connection 
with the department has been upwards of 5,015,217. This total, compared with that 
of the previous year, presents an increase of 203,959 persons. 
The expenditure of the department during the financial year 1882~83, exclusive of 
+ the vote for the geological survey, which was 18,5361. 17s. 4d., amounted to 326,8260.

GREECE, constitutional monarchy: Area, 19,941 square miles ; population, 1,679,775. Capital, Athens; 
population, 63,374. Minister of education, Lombardos. 
No educational statistics are at hand for the year under consideration, but the fol- 
lowing items, from the pen of Professor Pio, of Denmark, give an insight into the 
school life of Greece. % 
A great stumbling block to learning is said to be the use of modern Greek in eonversa- 
tion and ancient Greek in official and social correspondence. Even adults find that this 
creates a difficulty, and for children it is especially hard to overcome. Compulsory 
education for children between 5 and 12 years of age is a feature of the law since 1834, 
Yet even the fine of 50 francs for any infringement of the law has no material effect; 
and it practically remains a dead letter on the statute books. The people will not pay 
the fines, and the officials omit to enforce the penalty. Certain studies are required 
by law, but theory and practice seem to differ. The law specifies the following sub- 
jects for common schools: the catechism, elementary Greek, writing, arithmetic, 
weights and measures, linear drawing, singing, and, “ when convenient,” the elements 
of geography, history of the country, and the elementary training most needed in 
natural sciences. For boys there are these additional branches: gymnastics, practical 
agriculture, horticulture, arboriculture, beekeeping, and silk culture ; for girls, prac- 
tical instruction in handiwork. In reality no instruction is given in gymmastics, at 
least the writer of this article has seen nothing of the kind, either in the common or 
higher schools. In the district schools many of the abovementioned branches are 
taught; in the village schools the limit is reading and writing (not very correct chi- 
rography either) and the fundamental rules of arithmetic in addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. After 1834 many of the schools were subdivided into 
schools for girls and schools for boys, yet many mixed schools existed. As the years 
went on the people revolted against the coeducation of the sexes, so that by law of 
1852 a separation took place, and a philanthropic society took charge of educating 
girls. In Greece, the connecting link between the common (elementary), middle 
(Hellenic), and higher schools (gymnasia) is an esfablished fact. In the Hellenic 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
    CCXXX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schools, which are similar in grade to the lower Gymnasien of Germany, instruction 
is given in ancient Greek, biblical history, ancient Greek history, with short exercises 
in more modern history, in geography, arithmetic, and geometry. French is taught 
from the second school year, while pupils fitting for the gymnasium take up Latin 
from the third year. The course of study in the gymnasium includes reading from 
Greek authors, with grammatical instruction (12 hours a week), Latin (4 hours a 
week), French, history, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and mathematical geogra- 
phy ; also, natural history, physics, psychology, logic, and religions instruction. Ac- 
cording to the school law of 1836, German, drawing, painting, and music are also to 
be taught, but they do not enter into the course. In theory the Hellenic (middle) 
schools require a good deal of their pupils, but, on account of the scarcity of scholars, 
this course of study is rarely carried out. In a gymnasium the pypils are expected to be 
very thorough, and the requirements are considerable, but the Culture of the teaching 
force is defective. Tuition fees are the order of the day in the lower grades, but in- 
struction is free in the middle and higher schools. In the matter of punishment a 
very humane course is pursued, the law forbidding corporal punishment. Unfortu- 
nately this phase of law does not seem to be appreciated by the school children, for 
they are reported as lacking greatly in discipline. According to official statements 
the illiteracy among the people, estimated or the basis of those supposed to attend 
the lower public schools, is as follows: In the district of Thebes, as in the Peloponne- 
sus, the Dayoantage of population regarded as illiterate is 90 to 95 per cent,; in other 
districts, 75 to 90 per cent.; and where more favorable reports are received —as in 
Attica—55 to 60 per cent. can neither read nor write. The contrast in the education 
of the sexes is quite noticeable. For instance, in Attica and Ithaca, where more than 
half of the men hgve some education, there are few districts in which more than 30 
per cent. of the women are educated, while often only 1 to 2 per cent. haye been m- 
structed. As an ofiset to the statements of a lack of education mentioned above, te- 
ports indicate that private schools are flourishing. The philanthropic society asso- 
ciated in the work of providing a suitable education for girls has developed many * 
private institutions. These are laying a foundation for a higher order of culture 
than is found elsewhere. 
‘Favorable reports are received from the American school of classical studies at 
Athens, which was under the charge of Prof. William W. Goodwin, of Harvard Col- 
lege, during its first year. 
Tray, constitutional monarchy: Area, 114,296 square miles; population, 28,452,639. Capital, Rome; 
population (at end of 1880), 300,467. Minister of public instruction, G. Baccelli. 
The latest available statistics published by the Italian government give some in- 
teresting information respecting public instruction in that country. 
Cost of education.— From these statistics it appears that only about 12,500,000 lire! 
($2,412,500) were expended for public instruction during the first year of the existence 
of the kingdom. From 1867 to 1870 the average annual expenditure was about 
15,000,000. Since then the increase has been rapid, as is shown by the following 
figures:

Primary instruction.—Before the unification of Italy primary instruction was only 
organized in Piedmont (law of 1848). The first general organic law dates from Novem- 
ber, 1859. This law makes instruction compulsory and gratuitous for all children 
from 6 to 12 years of age. It should be remarked, however, that its provisions were 
not carried into execution. It should also be noted that under the law the com- 
munes were to bear the expense of establishing new primary schools. For this 
reason the increase in the number of these schools was not very rapid, as is shown by 
the following table: a

  CCXXXIT_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The number of pupils nearly doubled from 1861 to 1876, but 28,000 should be de- 
ducted from the total for the annexed provinces, Rome and Venice, and the general 
increase of population of the kingdom should also be taken into account. During the 
same period (1861 to 1876) the number of primary school teachers increased from 21,050 
to 37,623 in the public schools and from 7,123 to 9,462 in the private. On July 15, 1877, 
the law on primary instruction was passed. It went into effect in 187778 and requires 
all communes of less than 5,000 persons to have at least one teacher to 1,000 inhabi- 
tants; communes of from 5,000 to 20,000 population, one teacher to 1,200 inhabitants ; 
and all the more important communes, at least one teacher to 1,500 persons, In 
all other communes the law had to be applied gradually. At'the end of the school 
year 1877~'78, 7,533 communes out of a total of 8,279 were complying with the law 
making instruction obligatory. In 1881 about 700 additional communes came under 
thenewlaw. The progress which resulted from the application of this law was slower 
than had been expected and is shown by the following figures:

The private schools decreased during the two years 1878 and 1879 from 9,156 to 7,422 
and the total number of primary schools increased only from 47,411 to 48,530. The

These figures represent the enrolment, not the actual attendance. The number 
of children who gradually absented theniselyes from school, especially in summer 
time, amounted to a third of the enrolment.

It should be added that 7} per cent. of the population cannot profit by the primary 
schools on account of the distance of the schools from their dwellings. : 
There were, in 1878~79, 11,161 schools for adult males, 472 for females; 592 Sunday 
schools for males and 5,979 for females. These schooli were attended by 460,818 males 
and 207,308 females. The census of 1881 shows that in 18 principal towns the number 
of persons from 12 to 18 years of age who conld neither read nor write varied between 543 
721

82,55 and 51.15 per cent. of the population. In145 chief towns there were only 32 where 
the percentage of illiteracy was less than 30; in 13 the proportion was 80 per cent. ; 
in 12, 70 per cent. ; in 18, 60 per cent. ; and the rest varied from 50 to 30 or less, There 
is considerable improvement in this respect in children between 6 and 12 years-of 
age, for the proportion of them unable to read or write has declined to 72 per cent. in 
the pontifical states and to 20 per cent.in Lombardy. Ten and twenty years ago 
the percentage was as follows:

The proportion of all persons over 5 years of age who could neither read nor write 
declined from 75 to 69 per cent. during the decade 1861 to 1871. 
Classical and technical instruction in secondary schools.— Secondary classical instruc- 
tion lasts eight years, the first five of which are passed in the gygnnasia and the re- 
maining three in the lycées or colleges. The number of these institutions in 1880-81, 
with their enrolment, was as follows:

These schools had a total teaching force of 2,704 persons. 3 
There were also 79 technical institutes, public and private, with 6,878 enrolled stu- 
dents and 1,169 teachers, and 26 naval schools (merchant marine), with 816 students 
and 183 teachers. There were therefore in'1880~’81 a total of 1,487 secondary insti- 
tutions, with 9,331 teachers and 82,071 enrolled students. 
Superior and special instruction.— The 17 royal universities of Italy are those at Bo- 
logna, Cagliari, Catania, Genoa, Macerata, Messina, Modena, Naples, Padua, Palermo, 
Parma, Pavia, Pisa, Rome, Sassari, Sienna, and Turin. The total enrolment, during 
the scholastic year 188081 was 10,592 students. The largest numbers were enrolled 
at the universities of Naples and Turin and were 2,851 and 1,651, respectively. Then 
came Padua with $73, Rome with 754, Bologna with 743, and Pavia with 714 students.

  CCXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Pisa, Genoa, and Palermo had hetween 500 and 600 students each, and the rest 
a much smaller number. There are 4 independent universities in the kingdom, at 
Camerino, Ferrara, Perugia, and Urbino, which had a total of 265 students in 188081, 
Besides these there were 21 superior institutes, academies, and special schools, with 
1,948 enrolled students. This makes a total of 12,805 enrolled students in the higher 
institutions of learning in Italy in the year 1880-81. 
Marra AND Gozo, British colony: Area, 111 square miles; population, 149,782. Director of education, 
S. Savona, 
The following information is derived from the report of the director for 1882: 
The department includes (1) the primary or elementary schools in Malta and Gozo; 
(2) the lyceum and the female secondary or intermediate school at Valletta and the 
Gozo secondary school; (3) the university. 4 
The primary schools are entirely under the management of the director of educa- 
tion, assisted by an inspector, who examines each school twice a year and visits tho 
same at least once in every quarter. In the administration of the lyceum, the direc- 
tor of education is assisted by the speical council of the faculty of arts and sciences, 
and in all important matters connected with the university the director of education 
is advised by the special councils of each of the four faculties, of which he is the pres- 
ident. The principal of the university is intrusted with the general supervision and 
the maintenance of discipline in the several schools of the university and lyceum. In 
the director of education, under the head of the government, is vested the supreme 
control of the education department, for which he is responsible to the governor. 
The government of Malta thus makes provision for the educational requirements of 
all classes of the people. 3 
Gratuitous elementary schools are open to the children of the poor in all the towns 
and in almost every village in Malta and Gozo. The lyceum of Valletta and the see- 
ondary school of Rabato, Gozo, prepare the sons of the middle and higher classes for 
the superior professional studies pursued in the university, for the civil service, the 
army, government and other appointments, and for commerce. The university com- 
pletes, in the arts faculty, the studies pursued in the lyceum; prepares students for 
the degree of m. A, and for entering upon their professional studies in the faculties 
of theology, law, or medicine; and, after an academical course of 4 years in any one 
of these faculties, confers upon successful students the degree of D. D., LL. D., or M. D. 
Primary schools.— The rolls of the primary schools for thé month of October, 1882, 
showed 9,891 pupils registered and 7,158 in average attendance. The unsatisfactory 
results accomplished in the primary schools led to the appointment of a special com- 
missioner to inquire into the causes. These were reported to be, in the main, want of 
trained teachers, adoption of Italian as the medium of communication, and inefficient 
and badly paid assistants. With reference to the first of the causes specified Mr. Sa- 
yona says: 
The chief cause of the unsatisfactory condition of our primary schools, as pointed 
out by Sir P. Keenan, was the want of trained teachers, snitably remunerated for the 
important work intrusted to them; and, before that want is adequately supplied, it 
is vain toexpect any real and permanent improyement in our elementary schools. 
Not only was the training of the teachers employed entirely neglected, but the rate 
of payment offered to them from the beginning was most inadequate to secure the 
services of persons possessing the literary qualifications required to teach, besides 
other branches, the two foreign languages (English and Italian), through which it 
was attempted to give instruction to the children of the poor. Eleven pounds a year, 
rising to a maximum of 38/., was the salary offered in 1851 to the schoolmistresses, 
and 181., rising to 45/., was assigned to the schoolmasters that were called upon to 
devote 6 hours a day to the education of the people. These minimum rates were in 
1861 raised to 217. and 38/., and the maximum to 48l. and 651., respectively. At the 
time of my appointment, little more than two years ago, there were 8 schoolmis- 
tresses receiving 211. a year and 11 with a salary of 251.; whilst 7 schoolmasters re- 
received 381. a year and 16 from 411, to 451. a year; this, too, at a time when police- 
men were paid at the rate of 301. to 38I., and clerks in the public service received 
601. a year on first appointment, with the prospect of rising to 2501. and even to 5001,

ayear. As was natural, none but young’men, who were unable, because not quali- 
fied, to obtain better situations, offered themselves to perform the duties of element- 
ary teachers, and to these teachers, without any attempt being made to train them 
for the duties of their profession, was intrusted the arduous task of developing the 
mind and heart and of moulding the character of the rising generation, besides 
teaching them the English and Italian languages, arithmetic, writing, geography, 
the catechism, and the other subjects enumerated in the programs of the schools. 
Arrangements have been made by which a certain number of promising pupil teach- 
ers may be sent to England annually to be prepared for their work in some one of the 
inspected training schools. The first company sent under this arrangement, viz, four 
in 1881, will not return to Malta before January, 1884, and the result of this excellent 
measure will not be felt for some years yet. 
Salaries.— Teachers’ salaries have also been materially increased since the 1st of De- 
cember, 1881. The lowest salary now paid to principal teachers is for men 501. a year, 
for women, 401. a year; average salary: for men, 641, ; for women, 531. The teaching 
staff numbers 77 principal teachers and 225 assistants. The director reports that the 
increase of salaries has had a most salutary effect on the schools.

In the figures for 1881-82 students attending the universities gratuitously are not 
included. They numbered 179, of whom 101 were at Leyden, 44 at Utrecht, and 34 at 
Groningen. 
The number of students at the communal university of Amsterdam was 637 in 1881-82, 
against 632 in 188081. The independent university at Amsterdam had 15 students 
in 1881-82. There were 24 Gymnasien and 5 Progymnasien, with 334 teachers and 
1,911 students. 
To these Gymnasien should be added 13 private institutions intended to prepare 
young men for superior instruction. These institutions were attended by 613 students 
in 188182. Besides these there were also 14 seminaries of various denominations, 
which have theological and literary courses combined, These institutions had an at- 
tendance of 1,323 students. The fotal outlay for the universities in 1881 was 1,339,870 
florins ($538,628). For the Gymnasien, Progymnasien, &c., there were expended dur- 
ing the same time 332,361.52} florins ($133,609). The total amount expended by the 
state and communes for the universities, Gymnasien and Progymnasien, Latin schools, 
and seminaries was 1,918,391 florins ($771,193.) 
Secondary instruction.— There were 86 burgher schools and similar establishments in 
1881, with 3,871 students against 4,034 the preyiousyear. The teachers numbered 369, 
There were, besides, 46 drawing, industrial, and professional schools, with 252 teachers 
and 4,842 students, and 59 higher burgher schools, with 4,653 pupils. Twenty-one of 
these schools were open to girls and had an attendance of 150. Tke number of higher 
burgher schools attended by both sexes was increased by 2, while the nymber of 
female students diminished by 5, compared with the previous year. The inerease in 
the number of male students over 1880. was 144. The teachers of the higher burgher 
schools numbered 668, Besides the mixed burgher schools aboye mentioned there were 
14 schools of the same grade for girls exclusively, attended by 1,089 pupils in 1881 
against 1,002 in 1880, The teachers numbered 165, of whom 106 were women. This 
grade of schools received 992,704 florins ($399,067) from the state, the total expendi-

ture being 1,965,118 florins ($789,977). Tlie Royal School of Midwifery had 11 stu- 
dents during the year 1881-82. The Royal Veterinary School had 53 students during 
the same year. 
Primary instruction.—The primary schools showed an increase of 47 over the year 
1st0, and numbered 3,927. Of these, 2,799 were public schools, 86 were private sub- 
sidized schools, and 1,050 were private schools not subsidized. A comparison of the 
attendance in January, 1881, and January, 1882, results as follows:

The number of children of school age who did not receive instruction during the 
year 1881~’82 was 71,658, of whom 30,725 were boys. In 1880 the number of children 
receiving no instruction was 70,085. The school population in 1881-’82 was 528,827 
children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The previous yoar it was 517,259. Non- 
attendance at school was due in great measure to the want of suitable school accom- 
modations in the large communes, and this defect will be soon remedied. It is ex- 
pected also that a salutary effect will be felt from the general interdiction of infant 
labor, which was forbidden in only 115 communes in the year 1881. The number of 
pupils attending evening schools exclusively was 10,866, of whom 8,610 were boys. 
This does not include 7,601 pupils of the review schools. The number of teachers 
in the year 1881 was 15,123, of whom 3,747 were women. The previous year the num- 
ber was 14,174. The normal courses were attended by 829 persons, 588 of whom were 
men. The state appropriation for primary instruction in 1$81 was 4,665,228 florins 
($1,875,422), an increase of 2,224,237 florins over the amount granted in 1880. The 
communes contributed 5,533,715 florins ($2,224,553). The total amount expended in 
» 1881 for educational establishments, except military, prison, and protection schools for 
infants, was 14,168,734 florins, or $5,695,831. 
These infant schools and asylums numbered 802 in 1881, with 87,728 infants in 
attendance and 2,710 teachers. These figures, however, do not include many private 
institutions of this character, about which the government has no information.

The latest information with reference to the schools of this country is to be found 
in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1881. 
A catalogue of the famous Latin school of Norway, the Aars og Voss’s latin- og 
realskole, presents the following statistics: This school is a private establishment 
situated at Christiania; in 1883 it entered on its twentieth year of existence. In 
1882~83 there were 47 mile instructors and 3 women teachers connected with the 
school. Three divisions are reported: the common, with5 classes; the Latin, with 6; 
and the real, with 5, The pupils in regular attendance numbered 578 in 187374 
and 782 in 1882~83. Of the 782, 620 resided in Christiania, 50 came from other Nor- 
wegian towns, 107 from the rural districts, and 5 from other countries. There 
were, in the last year mentioned, 222 students in the Latin classes and 187 in the 
“real” classes. During the twenty years 2,777 pupils were reported, 2,022 in the last 
ten years. The studies for the common or lower division were religion, Norwegian and 
German, history, geography, naturai sciences, arithmetic, writing, and drawing. In 
the Latin and “real” divisions the studies enumerated are religion, Norwegian, Ger-

PortTuGAL, constitutional monarchy: Area, 36,510 square miles; population, 4,160,315. Capital, Lis- 
bon; population, 253,496. Minister of the interior, Barjona Freitas. 
Hon. John M. Francis, minister resident and consul general of the United States 
to Portugal, addressed a communication to the Department of State on the progress 
of education in Portugal, under date of December 29, 1883, which was forwarded to 
the Bureau of Education by the kindness of the Hon. Secretary of State. Mr. Fran- 
cis’s account is as follows: 
Portugal has made considerable and commendable progress in educational achieve- 
ment during the past fifteen years. 
A stimulus was given to this paramount interest of the state in 1869 by the testa- 
mentary ae of a large sum—150,0001.,I am informed—by the late Count 
Ferreira, of Oporto, for charitable and educational purposes in this kingdom. This 
included provision for the construction of 120 school-houses in needy districts. Then 
the government directed its efforts with more efficiency than ever before to the im- 
portant duty of making additional provisions for the education of the children of 
the state. 
Primary instruction, as now existing in Portugal, is based upon the decree of May 2, 
1878, modified somewhat by subsequent legislation. The primary schools are intended 
for the instruction of both'sexes and are divided into two classes, namely, primary and 
advanced primary. They are, for the most part, under district ‘control and sustained 
by district contributions. 
Attendance at the primary schools is obligatory, unless evidence is adduced that 
the children receive instruction at home or reside at a greater distance than two kilo- 
metres [about a mile and a quarter] from the public school. In case of non-attend- 
ance without the above valid excuses, parents or guardians are subject to fine. 
The primary schools are intended for all children from 6 to 12 years of age. Asa 
rule, every parish must have an elementary school; but in cases where the children 
of adjoining parishes do not exceed sixty in number, then one school may be organ- 
ized for two or more parishes. 
The parochial authorities are required to furnish house, books, and furniture for 
the school and residence for the teachers, and to pay the latter 100 milreis annually 
in rural districts, L20 in towns, and 150 in Lisbon and Oporto. In addition to this 
compensation the teacher is entitled to 5 cents monthly for each pupil under his in- 
struction, 2 milreis for each pupil passing successfully the final examination in the 
elementary branches, and, further, for every six years of acceptable service, an advance 
of 25 per cent.on the salary. There is also a pension system of small allowances for 
“retired” teachers. 
In the primary schools boys are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, elements of 
rammar, of the metrical system, rudiments of drawing, and ‘moral and Christian 
octrine,” the last excepted in the case of children not ‘Catholics ; the same tuition 
for girls, with the addition of needle work. Mixed schools are t0 be instructed by. 
married teachers, a lady to teach needlework. Boys may be taught by teachers of 
either sex. 
In each district there must be an advanced primary school, to be sustained by the 
municipality thereof, teachers of these schools to be paid at least 180, and in Lisbon 
and Oporto 200, milreis per annum, receiving also 2 milreis fer every pupil passing 
into a higher school. 
The “advanced primary” teaching for boys includes (1) reading and recitation in 
prose and verse; (2) writing and written exercises; (3) arithmetic and elementary 
geometry; (4) grammar; (5) legal system of weights and measures; (6) elements of 
cosmography, geography and Portuguese history; (7) sketching; (8) moral and sacred 
history; (9) elements of hygiene; “(10) elements of agriculture; (11) gymnastics ; 
(12) choral singing; (18) rights and duties of citizens. 
For the female sex, same as above from 1 to 9 inclusive, with lessons on the duties 
of a mother; also, embroidery, making patterns, taking measures, and lace and flower 
work. 
Theremust be a regular assistant for every 60 pupils, The municipalities are to 
appoint the teachers and pay them. 
‘There shall be in Lisbon and Oporto two normal schools for qualifying teachers 
of eithersex. Each school shall have 40 pupils of either sex, who shall be entitled to 
7 milreis monthly for maintenance, the same to be paid by the district. There shall 
be in other districts normal schools of the second class to the number of ten. Tho 
State will appoint and pay inspectors and subinspectors.

  CCXXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
In towns liaving more than one school, the municipality is authorized to establish 
“central schools,” with three or four teachers for each one. The establishment of 
evening and Sunday schools for adults is enjoined upon the various municipalities as 
aduty. In every district there shall be a school committee to aid the municipality, 
anil in every parish a parochial delegate. 
There shall be conferences of teachers in each district annually. 
The government will give annually prizes of 100 and 200 milreis to students; it 
will provide books by public competition every five years. It will aid the parochial 
assemblies in the creation of a school fund to assist the municipalities in the payment 
of teachers, in the establishment of evening and Sunday schools, in the establishment 
of Kindergiirteri for children, to enlarge educational institutions, to establish libraries, 
and to bestow prizes upon deserving teachers and worthy pupils, to secure pensions 
for poor scholars who may enter the normal schools, to provide proper instruments 
for instruction in the natural sciences, &c. 
Secondary instruction is given in institutions of three classes according to the decree 
of June 14, 1880, namely, central lyceums, national lyceums, and secondary mu- 
uitipal schools. There is a central lyceum in Lisbon, in Oporto, and in Coimbra; in 
éach of thé ¢apitals of other districts there is a national lyceum, All these are sup- 
ported by the state. Other municipalities may, upon petition, open secondary mu- 
nicipal schools, they paying two-thirds and the state one-third of the cost of their 
support. The object of these lyceums is to prepare pupils for admission into schools 
of superior instruction. 
The course in the central lyceum embraces (1) Portuguese language; (2) French 
language; (3) Latin; (4) geography, cosmography, universal and natural history ; (5) 
architegture, geometry, algebra, book-keeping; (6) elements of pliysics, chemistry, and 
natural’history; (7) elements of civil legislation, of Portuguese law, and political 
economy ; (8) drawing; (9) national literature; (10) natural and moral philosophy and 
laws of nature; (11) algebra, geometry, and trigonometry; (12) physics and chemis- 
try; (13) Latin; (14) Greek; (15) English ; (16) German. 
‘There are taught in the secondary schools (1) Portuguese; (2) French; (3) arithme- 
ticand geometry; (4) drawing; and there may be one or two professional chairs. 
No pupil under 10 years of age is to be admitted to the lyceumis. 
o school for private instruction by individuals can be opened without informing 
the supervisor of the district. 
The teachers of central lyceums receive an annual salary of 600 milreis; of the na- 
tional lyceums, 500; the rector of the central lyceums, 200; of national lyceums, 150; 
the teachers of secondary municipal schools, 200, with some additional fees for schol- 
ats and upon the successful examination of the latter. 
Superior instruction.— The centres of superior education are Lisbon, Oporto, and 
Coimbra. The university at Coimbra has faculties of law, theology, medicine, and 
philosophy or natural sciences. 
In Lisbon there are the polytechnic school, the army, navy, and medical and sur- 
gical schools, school for the superior course of literature, commercial and industrial 
school, general institute of agricultire, arid an academy of fine arts. 
There exist in every diocese of the kingdom institutions for ecclesiastical learning. 
At Oporto there are a polytechnic academy, an agricultural college, and an acad- 
eimy of fine arts. Near Cintra there is also an agricultural college, with an experi- 
mental farm. 
I have presented an analysis of the laws on the subject of education in Portugal. 
The system embraces a wide and extended field, with a great deal of machinery for 
its working, and, though it is imperfectly operated in many cases, the fact is con- 
ceded that decided educational advancement has been made in this kingdom since the 
enactment of these laws. 
No reliable statistics of the attendance of children at the public primary schools 
can be obtained. I have seen a statement that in 1875-’76 (before the adoption of 
the existing law enforcing attendance) there were in the kingdom and adjacent 
islands 141,166 children attending school. 
This, I am assured, was incorrect, and to my inquiries inregard to the number now 
in attendance I am told in the proper official department that no statistics can bo 
furnished which would be other than vague estimates.. It is a truth, however, that 
the wanit of school-housés is severely felt throughout the kingdom, that those exist- 
ing are uncomfortably crowded, and that in the city of Lisbon the want is pain- 
fully felt. However, gradually, but too slowly it is feared, buildings are provided 
for this purpose, to meet the growing necessity. 
The criticism [ have heard pronounced upon the educational system of Portugal is 
that it expends its greatest forces upon higher education, and fails to provide as good 
schools as should be maintained for elementary instruction. 
As to expenditures for education by the government (not ineluding the larger local 
contributions for this purpose), it may be stated that under the head of “ Public in-

In 188283 there wero 2,459 primary rural schools for both sexes reported. The 
pupils numbered 83,076, 8,544 of whom were girls; teachers, 2,101 males and 358 fe- 
males. In thé cities were 146 boys’ primaries, with 475 teachers and 23,832 pupils; 
also, 125 schools of like grade for girls, where 12,989 pupils were taught by 342 teach- 
ers of their own sex. Aniorg the higher grades there were 7 lyceums, with 160 pro-

seminaries had 1,512 pupils, under the care of 99 professors; 8 primary normals, with 85 
professors and 741 pupils; 5 comimercial schools, with 56 professors and 772 students, 
while in 12 secondary and professional schools for gitls there were 1,316 pupils, taught 
by 144 instructors. The special schools numbered 31; professors, 217; students of both 
seX6s, 2,316. The 2 universities, at Bucharest and Jaffy, had a total of 693 stu- 
dents and 87 professors. At Budharést there were 4 women studying, 1 in the philo- 
logical department, 1 in the philosophical, and 2 in the medical department. In ad- 
dition to thesé public schools there were 205 private schools, with 1,120 male and 
female teachers and 13,124 pupils.

Minister of public insttiiction, Delyanof. 
The state of education is such in Russia that but little information ean be given in 
reference to the country as a whole. At St. Petersburg there were 105 primary day 
schools and 8 schools taught on Sunday at the commencement of the year 1883. The 
pupils numbered 4,866. A haniliwork school for boys was also reported. Generally 
speakitig, education is at alow ebb in Russia. The upper classes are said to be at fault, 
and they are upheld by the clergy in preventing the spread of popular education. 
Still there is a tendency towards progress in certain directions: For instance, a proj- 
ect is on foot to establish a nuimber of superior primary schools for girls. Among the 
lower or middle classes in the cities ate many yotivg girls who earnestly desire an 
elementary education, A few parents sénd their daughters to the Gymnasien and Pro- 
gymisien, but the courses there are said to be too long and quite unsuited to these 
girls, who nitist necessarily labor for a livelihood. The plan at present is to have 
elementary grades especially adapted to the waits of this part of the population, In 
October, 1882; a beginning was maile, and the first superior primary school was es- 
tablished in St. Petersburg: The coursé of study covers 4 classes, and pupils are 
admitted between 9 and 11 years of age. The program of studies is as follows: 
religion, the Russian tongue, arithmetic, geography, calligraphy, natural and national 
history; drawing, geometry, singiiig, and needlework. These primary grades are to 
be attached to the so-called Empress Maria institutions: In Russian Gymnasien 
aiid Realschulen socialistic doctrines prevail to such an extent that the Russian au- 
thorities have taken the matter in hand. A circular of the minister of education, 
Deljanoff, states that in 13 Gymnasien, 1 Progymnasium, and 16 Realschulen evidences 
of the intluence of nihilistic ideas are noticeable, For this reason many new reg- 
ulations have been made; so that directors and teachers nay have better control of 
the pupils under their charge. Out of school, too, a certain watch is kept in regard 
to the movements of pupils. Thé police, parents, and teachers are expected to aid

the minister in his efforts to crush out revolutionary ideas. The only information 
obtainable for the year under consideration in regard to Russian universities is that 
reported on the foundation day of Dorpat University, which was celebrated on Decem- 
Der 23, 1883. Statistics at that date were as follows: In the theological faculty there 
were 191 students; in the law department, 242; in the medical, 711; in the histori- 
co-philological, 180; in the physico-mathematical, 109; total, 1,433. In the preced- 
ing year 1,331 students were reported. The increase of 102 students in the year 
speaks well for the college. Most of the chairs are filled, a statement which does not 
hold good in many of the Russian universities, as quite a number of professors have 
been called to professorships in other countries. 
SENVIA, principality: Area, 18,787 square miles; population (December 31, 1882), 1,810,606. Capital, 
Belgrade; population, 36,177. Minister of public instruction and worship, G. Pantelitch. 
The minister of public instruction and worship is at the head of educational and 
church affairs in Servia. A director has immediate supervision of the school system. 
There is also a council of education composed of 12 ordinary and 20 “extraordinary” 
members; the first of whom are appointed by the minister for 2 years and the second 
for 1, they being also eligible to reappointment. This body is recruited from the 
teaching force of the country. The council formulates school regulations and laws 
and, as a consulting body, aids the minister in executing the laws pertaining to schools 
and in deciding all literary and scientific questions. 
The library and national museum are considered a part of the educational system; 
a director has charge of each at asalary of 18,031 francs ($3,479). In 1883 the museum 
was placed under charge of the professor of archwology at the university. 
The university has a rector and 27 professors. In the budget there is an item of 
214,229.30 francs ($41,346) for the university. Of this amount 2,000 francs ($386) 
are for scientific excursions, 5,052 francs ($975) for a botanical garden,and 46,500 
franes ($8,974) to buy books, &c. ‘The university of Belgrade has faculties of philos- 
ophy, arts and trades, and law. It does not, however, grant doctors’ degrees, but 
simply prepares young gentlemen for liberal careers. ‘lhe number of students ranges 
from 150 to 200. 
The theological seminary, with 4 courses, 14 professors, and 186 pupils, is in the 
budget for 48,290 francs ($9,320). 
A school of pedagogy reports a director, 12 professors or instructors, 97 pupils, and 
93,970 francs from the budget. About 15,000 francs ($2,895) are to be used for the in- 
struction of young teachers who are insufficiently prepared, this instruction to take 
place during the vacations. At the close of 1881 a school of pedagogy was to be 
opened at Nich. This normal school was to be divided into two sections, one section 
to instruct pupil teachers for the Servians in Turkey. 
The Belgrade Gymnasium has a director, 22 professors, and 455 pupils, and an in- 
come of 81,710 francs annually. The Gymnasium at Kraguyewatz has a director, 18 pro- 
fessors, and 225 pupils; annual fund, 59,770 francs. A similar school at Nich, which 
is still incomplete, reports a director, 5 professors, and 73 pupils; annual income, 
16,208 francs from the state. Two Progymnasien in Belgrade, each under charge of 
a director, have 7 or 8 professors and over 150 pupils. The annual budget provides 
30,790 and 27,750 francs, respectively. Eighteen Progymnasien, several of them 
still incomplete, with but two or three classes, receive 202,420 francs annually, A 
Progymnasium at Oujiza, having 7 professors, 73 pupils, and funds amounting to 
16,909 francs, was to be changed into a Realschule. These Progymnasien have, by 
a recent law, courses of study very similar to the courses in the lower classes of the 
Realschulen, The special instruction commences with the upper divisions. The 
Realschule at Belgrade has 5 higher classes (the two lower classes have the same 
studies as the Gymnasien), 12 professors, and 47 pupils; funds, 35,540 francs ($6,859). 
A school for the higher education of young girls has a pedagogical section. There 
is a directress in charge; then there are 7 instructresses and 10 professors from the 
middle schools of Belgrade. The pupils number 250; funds, 49,428 francs.

Primary education is given in 614 schools, with 705 men and 112 women teachers. 
Pupils: boys, 24,000 ;* girls, 4,000. For teachers’ salaries the budget provides 760,000

SPAIN, constitutional monarchy: Area, 195,767 square miles ; population (June 1883), 16,858,721. Cap- 
ital, Madrid; population, 397,690. 
Education in Spain is passing through a period of reform, the object of which is to 
reorganize the system of public instruction so that it may compare favorably with 
educational methods in other countries. The present government is eager to break 
loose from precedent and has already taken the first steps in that direction. Its 
first general measure was the publication of the royal decree and ministerial circular 
of March 3, 1881, which set forth the views of the government on public instruction 
and reinstated the professors who had been removed from their chairs in 1875. Before 
carrying its projected reforms of educational methods into execution the government 
sought to find out the opinions of teachers on the subject, which was done by means 
of the decree and circular of July 15, 1881. In order to enable the public to form a 
correct idea of the legislation and other measures taken in other countries in regard 
to public instruction, the royal decree of September 12, 1881, supplemented the pre- 
ceding decree by creating a special library under departmental direction. 
‘Then came the decree of March 4, 1882, reorganizing the system of inspection of edu- 
cational institutions. The number of inspectors was increased, and they were re- 
quired to visit all the institutions in their districts and report on them. Following 
this came measures of a more special character and particularly those affecting pri- 
‘ mary instruction, which has always been in a lamentable condition in Spain. The 
only innovation worthy of praise made in this branch of education during the last 
twenty-five years is the establishment of the Frébel school at Madrid, by decree of 
March 31, 1876. Other attempts at reform, although supported by official decrees, 
have been unsuccessful. 
A notable evil, which has always affected primary education, is the practice of al- 
lowing the small salaries of teachers to remain unpaid. The arrearages amounted to 
* such a large sum in 1881 that the King himself took the initiative, and provision was 
made for paying salaries promptly when due. This was etiected by the decree of 
‘June 15, 1882. 
On May 6, 1882, an educational museum was.established, embracing collections of 
models and drawings of Spanish and foreign primary schools, furniture, and appa- 
ratus, scientific apparatus and material, objects and charts for illustration, and a 
library. On August 13 of the same year a fourth year was added to the course of the 
central normal school for female teachers, and on May 17 provision was made for the 
care and training of very young children in ‘‘ maternal” schools. The necessity of 
providing better educated teachers for primary instruction is recognized in Spain, 
and this necessity is greater there than in many other countries, because the propor- 
tion of children whose education ceases with the primary grade is larger. 
Little change has as yet been made in secondary education. By a decree of July 8, 
1881, an industrial school was established at Toledo and a veterinary school at San- 
tiago. 
ya new professorships were established in the universities during the period 
188182, and the salaries of the professors were raised. 
In addition to the decrees mentioned above there were two, of March 17, 1882, and 
February 23, 1883, which, if carried out, will lead to great educational reforms. The 
substance of them is as follows: The public primary or infant schools are to be placed 
4n charge of women, who are to be aided by assistants, according to the number of 
pupils. For more than 60 pupils at least one other teacher is to be employed, with 
title of professor; under 60 pupils the directress is allowed to designate one of her 
own sex to aid her.

CCXLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
These schools are to be free; the school age is from 3 to 7. In benevolent institu- 
tions, in charge of sisters of charity or of any religious body, children up to 4 
years of age are to be cared for. Above that age they are to be placed in the public 
schools. Directresses who-are obliged to have an assistant are to receive extra com- 
pensation: not less than 275 pesetas (peseta=19.3 cents) in schools where the salary 
is less than 1,650 pesetas, 325 pesetas where it amounts to that, and 375 when the 
pay is greater. To be a head teacher the proper qualifications must be shown as 
required by law and the proper certificates obtained. There are to be boards of 
directors of primary schools (Patronato general de las escuelas de parvulos), com- 
posed of a president and eight members, appointed by the minister of commerce and 
agriculture, Among the members are to be the directress of the central normal 
school, one other woman, and several professors already connected with the corps of 
primary school instructors. One of these professors is to be secretary of the board. 
The regulations of the board are to be considered by authorities, officials, and cor- 
porations as orders from the minister, while the board may act without referring to 
the minister. An annual report is to be published by the board. A special course 
for preparing primary school teachers, principals, or assistants is to be opened atthe 
central normal school at the beginning of the next academic year. Professors for 
primary grades are to be appointed by the minister in accordance with any sugges- 
tion from the board of directors as a whole. According to the decree of February 23, 
1883, local boards of primary instruction (juntas locales) are to publish each Decem- 
ber an annual census of all children of the ages specified by the law of September 9, 
1857, who are found within their districts. The provincial committees and the boards 
of directors are to receive copies. In April and October of each year teachers of 
primary grades are to send in to the president of the local board of their commune, 
or district, a complete list of the boys and girls in attendance at school during the 
preceding term. This list is to cover scholarship, conduct, and general bearing of 
pupils, &c. Inspectors of primary grades are to be advised of the fines imposed 
in executing the law of 1857, and justices of the peace are also to forward the 
decisions pronounced during the year according to the provisions of the penal code. 
The inspectors are to give the board of directors, in June and December, a list of the 
children of school age, attendance, or reasons for non-attendance, with suggestions 
as to negligence of local authorities. Inspectors not attending to their duties and 
offering no good exeuse are to be dismissed. The hoard of directors is to report to the 
minister any negligence on the part of the authorities in warning parents of the pen- 
alties attached to non-attendance of children at school. Teachers of either sex who 
increase attendance in their schools from term to term, keep their lists up to the 
maximum, show good reports as to punctuality, scholarship, &c., are to be rewarded 
as follows: by receiving a sum of money in proportion to their salary and to the 
reports made; by honorable mention; with right to an earlier promotion; with greater 
inerease of salary than would naturally follow; and by report of their names to the 
to the minister for some honorary distinction. 
Special meetings are to be held annually by local boards to decide as to the compen- 
sation of teachers. The minister is to reward teachers according to the representa- 
tions made by the general and provincial boards. Allowance is to be made in the 
general budget for such pecuniary rewards, and local and provincial committees or 
boards are requested to add whatever funds seem necessary and to distribute a few 
prizes to poor parents who have made sacrifices in order to send their children to 
school at the proper hour each day. Provincial and local boards and primary school 
inspectors who show great zeal in enforcing the attendance of pupils are to be espe- 
cially and honorably mentioned by the government. All public functionaries of the 
  state, province, or municipality, with a salary not exceeding 1,500 pesetas a year, E 
must show to their immediate chief that their children over 6 years of age have re- 
ceived the education required by the law in either public or private schools. Labor-

Employés carrying out the above to the best of their ability are not to be dismissed 
for any apparent fault until they have been allowed a hearing. Heads of depart-

Swepen, constitutional monarchy: Area, 170,979 square miles; population, 4,579,115. Capital, Stock- 
holm; population, 185,325. Minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs, Carl Gustaf Hammars- 
kjdld. 
The latest educational statistics from Sweden were given in the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for 1881. The subject of industrial education is one of great 
interest in Sweden, as elsewhere, and the following items give the latest news in 
regard to this matter. At the ninth meeting of the Swedish Common School Teach- 
ers’ Association, which took place at Upsala, in August, 1883, about 1,300 teachers 
were present. The subject of industrial training was earnestly discussed, and it was 
stated that handwork had already become a part of the course in 500 schools of 
Sweden. There is also a seminary at Niiis, where manual training is carried on to 
perfection. The object of such instruction is to produce orderly methods, skill in use 
of the hands, close attention to business and to inculcate habits of industry and produce 
a general interest in work for the work’s sake. Certain methods are adhered to very 
closely. Work in wood is a specialty, and 100 models are used in the different steps 
leading up to the end of the course. In connection with the teachers’ meeting, there 
was a display of articles made by different schools. The finest specimens came from 
Stockholm, in which city about 370 boys receive industrial training three times a 
week, 24 hours eachtime. What Sweden is doing for the education of woman may 
easily be learned from the following: 
Until the early part of this century the education of women had preserved an ex- 
clusively private character in Sweden. The rich families of the aristocracy intrusted 
the education of their daughters to governesses and the middle classes in easy cir- 
cumstances had recourse to private schools established in the cities or the country. 
These schools were always in charge of women and were ordinarily combined with 
accommodations for boarding a greater or less number of pupils. A certain number 
.of women received in this way a relatively good education, considering the demands 
of the times, but the great majority, even among the educated classes, were content 
with very elementary instruction. According to the ideas then in vogue it was a 
waste of time for women to devote themselves much to study; it was enough for them 
to know how to manage their domestic affairs properly and to appear well in society. 
In the private boarding schools the principal aim was to enable the scholars to carry 
on a conversation in foreign languages, especially French. Music, painting, and 
fancy work held a subordinate place. Religious instruction was generally given by a 
clergyman and embraced as a minimum the knowledge necessary for the confirma- 
tion of catechumens. The study of history, geography, and mathematics was of the 
most elementary kind and no attempt whatever was made to include natural sciences. 
Between the years 1820 and 1830 the need of public establishments for young girls 
began to be felt. In 1826 a merchant of Gothenburg, M. Jonas Kjellberg, be- 
queathed to that city the sum of 50,000 crowns (about $13,500), in memory of his 
wife, for the establishment of an institution for the higher education of women. 
That institution was opened in 1835; it has received additional gifts at different 
times from the Kjellberg family, and is still in operation under the name of ‘‘The 
Kjellberg School.” In 1831 there was opened at Stockholm, through the efforts of 
Bishop Wallin, a new school for the education of women, which was designed to en- 
able young girls to acquire the same serious and substantial instruction boys received 
in the public schools. This establishment is still in existence, under the name of 
“The Wallin School.” It is a strictly private institution. All the measures tending 
to elevate the instruction of women could not, however, attain their complete devel- 
opment without government aid in providing capable teachers. A vigorous impulse
-P-A-G-E-244
CCXLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in this direction was given by a number of professors and men of learning interested 
in the education of women, who organized at Stockholm in the winter of 1858~59 a 
course of higher instruction for adult females. Many of the scholars were already 
teachers and others wished to prepare themselves for that vocation. From that 
moment the government took the movement in hand. The first normal schools for 
female teachers of primary schools were opened in 1860, and the normal school for 
female teachers of secondary schools was opened at Stockholm in 1861. Now there 
are 5 government normal schools for female teachers of primary schools and 7 for 
males. More than half the teachers of the primary schools are women, who, for the 
most part, have charge of the lower primary schools. The principal object of the 
superior normal school for female teachers is to train private teachers, that is, govern- 
esses, as well as mistresses of higher girls’ schools. At present it graduates twenty or 
twenty-five such teachers annually. 
The total number of girls’ high schools in Sweden is now between 60 and 70. Only 
one belongs to the government, namely, the practice school attached to the Superior 
Normal School for Female Teachers. The object of this school is to serve as a model 
for other high schools and to give an opportunity to the scholars of the normal schoo) 
of attending the school exercises and of taking part in them, so as to get practice in 
teaching. Nearly one-half of these girls’ schools are municipal institutions to a 
greater or less extent. In localities where the district or community has not estab- 
lished such schools intelligent and educated or tolerably wealthy private individu- 
als have joined together for that purpose. Generally they contribute a considerable 
sum at the outset to start the institution and guarantee additional amounts in case 
of need. The greater part of these schools receive aid from the district in which 
they are placed or from business concerns in the neighborhood, and some from the 
general council of the province. It is probable that they will gradually become 
purely community or district schools and will eventually be taken in charge by the 
municipalities. The other half of the girls’ high schools are exclusively private and 
are established wherever they can be supported by the tuition fees. With the excep- 
tion of the Kjellberg school at Gothenburg, all the institutions for the superior edu- 
cation of women receive tuition fees. In this respect they differ from all the other 
educational institutions of the country. 
An idea of the scope of the education given in these girls’ high schools in Sweden 
may be obtained from the following program of subjects taught in one of them, 
which is substantially a representative one. The figures of the table give the num- 
ber of hours devoted weekly to each subject of study by each of the classes,

  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCXLV 
These studies are all obligatory in the three lower classes; in the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth classes fancy work is optional; in the seventh and eighth classes one of the foreign 
languages may be dispensed with, as well as geometry and drawing; singing and 
gymnastics are electives in these two classes. French is the foreign language most in 
demand. In the western part of the country, however, and in some cities, the schools 
commence with German, and one of them gives English a prominent place. The fact 
that German occupies the leading place in secondary schools for boys may account for 
its comparative popularity in girls’ schools, but in the majority of them French holds 
its sway and has increased in popularity in the last few years. 
The age for admission to these high schools for girls is generally fixed at 9 years, 
asin the boys’ schools. Most of the girls’ schools have a preparatory department, 
which embraces three classes for children from 6 to 9 years. It appears from the 
program of studies that obligatory instruction is, strictly speaking, limited to the first 
six classes ; consequently, obligatory studies are confined to a period ending with the 
fifteenth year of the pupil’s age. 
SwitzpRianp, federal republic: Area, 15,992 square miles; population, 2,846,102. Capital, Berne; 
population, 36,000. 
Educational statistics of the different cantons for the year 1881 were not received 
in time for the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1881, They are herewith 
presented. 
The totals, according to the Statistik itiber das Unterrichtswesen in der Schweiz, 
show that in the whole of Switzerland there were, on March 31, 1882, 434,080 pupils 
in the 4,386 primary schools. Of these, 14,892 were natives of other countries. German 
was the mother tongue of 311,271; French, of 97,113; Italian, of 19,864; the Romance 
tongues, of 5,832. There were 2,021 feeble-minded children not attending school and 
7,876 children free from school attendance. In the 4,386 schools there were 8,362 classes, 
6,462 of them mixed. About half the schools employ one teacher only. ‘The teaching 
force numbered 5,840 men and 2,525 women, an average of 1 teacher to 52 pupils. 
Among the male teachers there were 15 belonging to some religious order and 30 lay 
brothers; among the female teachers, 299 belonging to an order. The age of male 
teachers was ‘between 15 and 80 years. Over 80 years of age there were 2 teachers; 
between 71 and 80 years, 40; between 61 and 70 years,306. The 12 oldest women 
were between 61 and 70 years of age. There were 90 between 51 and 60 years. 
Between the ages of 15 and 20 were 250 men and 335 women teachers. ‘Two men had 
taught 60 years, 32 from 51 to 60 years; 294 men and 8 women had taught between 41 
and 50 years. There was 1 teaeher to every 340 inhabitants. For teachers’ salaries 
(males) 7,608,694 francs ($1,468,478) were expended; for women, 2,074,560 francs 
($400,390). Added to this there were 686,775 francs’ worth of produce for the men and 
179,270 for the women, an average of 1,419 francs in value for each man and 901 for 
each woman. The canton of Berne paid out the largest amount for the support of 
teachers, viz, 2,375,214 francs; Ziirich, 1,381,258; Vaud, 1,200,395 francs. The high- 
est average salaries were paid in Ziirich, 2,228 francs for men, 1,805 francs for women. 
‘There were 17 teachers who are graduates of universities, 63 from Gymnasien, 6,971 
from normal schools, and 85 from primary schools. 
The annual expenditure for the schools was 14,781,616 francs ($2,852,852) ; the value 
of school property, 137,534,597 francs ($26,544,177). 3 
In the 413 secondary schools (283 of which were mixed) were 11,155 boys and 8,976 
girls; men teaching, 1,216 (958 lay teachers, 14 belonging to some order, and 244 lay 
brothers); women, 232 (200 lay, 32 sisters). The teachers’ salaries amount annually 
to 2,370,180 francs. The expenditures were 2,136,514 francs; the school property 
amounted to 9,077,720 francs. ‘There were 102 middle schools, including Gymnasien, 
technical industrial schools, normal schools, and those for girls. The pupils in at- 
tendance numbered 9,492 boys and 2,093 girls. 
The ‘‘high schools” (universities), located at Ziirich, Berne, Basle, and Geneva, re-

ported 2,512 students. At Ziirich are also a polytechnicum and a veterinary school ; 
at Lucerne, a theological institute; at Freiburg, a law school; and at Lausanne and 
Neufchatel, academies. . There were 104 women pursuing higher studies in connection 
with these ten schools. 
In the Kindergiirten (which are obligatory only in the canton of Geneva) there were 
10,864 boys and 11,242 girls; in private schools, 6,057 boys and 4,834 girls. The Fort- 
bildungsschule Ge review school) is only obligatory in two cantons, Thurgovia and 
Soleure. 
A total of 516,925 children was reported on March 31, 1882, in some grade of 
school. The funds for school purposes vary in the different cantons; in certain ean- 
tons there is no school fund; in others the taxes leave a large amount above expen- 
ditures; in others still, private parties and communes raise from fourteen to fifteen 
million franes annually for school purposes. 
Hon. M. J. Cramer, minister resident and consul general of the United States in 
Switzerland, forwarded a communication on the Swiss school system to the State 
Department in December, 1882, which, by the kindness of the honorable Secretary 
of State, has been transmitted to this Bureau. In this communication Mr. Cramer 
gives the following translation of Article 27 of the present federal constitution of 
Switzerland in regard to public instruction: 
The several cantons will provide for sufficient primary instruction, which shall 
be under the exclusive supervision of the state. It is to be obligatory, and in the 
public schools gratis. The public schools shall be so conducted that they may be 
attended by the children of all confessions (denominations) without their Tberey of 
faith and conscience being encroached upon. Against cantons which neglect to fol- 
low these provisions the confederation is to take the necessary steps. 
Mr. Cramer also quotes the following resolution of the Federal Assembly in regard 
to the preceding article, adopted on June 14, 1882: 
The federal council is instructed to cause the department of the interior to collect 
without delay such information concerning the public schools in the several can- 
tons as is necessary for a thorough execution of Article 27 of the federal constitution, 
as well as for the adoption of laws in relation to it. In order to enable the depart- 
inant of the interior to carry out the provisions of this resolution, that department 
appoint a secretary (of education) with a salary of 6,000 francs, whose duties 
a be prescribed by the federal council. 
This resolution gave dissatisfaction in many quarters, on account of the apparent 
abridgment of the rights of the individual cantons which it sanctioned. Accord- 
ingly a petition was drawn up against the resolution, as allowed by the Swiss con- 
stitution, and signed by 180,000 persons. When the vote was taken on November 
26, 1882, the resolution was defeated by a vote of 316,852 against 171,970. 
TL.— Asia. 
Britisu Inpra: Area, 1,383,504 square miles; population, 253,906,449. 
The following information is from the reports of the director of public instruction 
for the Bombay presidency for 188182 and 1882~’83: The total number of all schools 
and colleges aided and inspected by government was, for 1881~’82, 5,704, having on 
the rolls March 31, 1882, 358,891 pupils, 1.57 per cent, of the estimated population 
(22,928,851). For 1882~’83 the number of schools was 6,138, having on the rolls March 
31, 1883, 389,986 pupils, or 1,68 per cent, of the estimated population (23,184,835). 
The income of the department in 1881~82 was, from provincial funds, 1,128,148 ru- 
pees (rupee = 38.3 cents); from local funds, 1,295,109 rupees; total, 2,423,257 rupees. 
The total expenditure on schools and institutions connected with government, in- 
cluding the expenditure from private funds on aided schools and the cost of schools 
belonging to native states and inspected by the education department, was 3,407,508 
rupees. The corresponding figures for 1882~83 are: income from provincial and local 
funds, 2,618,091 rupees; expenditures, 3,811,222 rupees. 
Schools for girls— The total number of schools for girls is now 326, with 19,197 
pupils, but the director of public instruction has given these figures as exclusive of

28 schools of the high and middle class and of many girls, whose number should 
have been stated, attending boys’ schools. In 1882~83 schools for girls numbered 
359, with 23,586 pupils. 
In 188182 the night schools numbered 134, with 3,919 pupils; in 1882~83 the num- 
ber was increased to 176 schools, with 4,826 pupils. 
In 1882~83 the number of pupils learning English was 26,732, The total number 
of Mussulmans at schools was 46,167. It is stated that the emplayment of special 
Mahometan deputy inspectors has produced good results. 
Physical training receives much attention. Most of the high schools are furnished 
with gymnasiums, and in some cess schools! a beginning has been made in providing 
the means of physical training. In some villages small open places near the school- 
houses are hedged round for the gymnasium, and soft earth or sand thrown over the 
levelled ground. 
University examinations.— The number of candidates sent up for matriculation ex- 
amination in 1881~82 was 1,374; number passed, 383, of whom 26 were Europeans. 
For the various degree examinations 643 candidates were sent up, of whom 221 
passed, including 3 Europeans. The corresponding report for 1882~83 gives the 
number sent up for matriculation as 1,600; passed, 572, including 30 Europeans. Num- 
ber sent up for the various degree examinations, 683; passed, 308, including 6 Eu- 
ropeans. 
From report on public instruction in British Burmah for the years 1881~82 and 
1882~83 : 
The total number of children of school age (4-19) in British Burmah, according to 
the recent census, is 1,327,080. The total number of schools under inspection in 
1881~82 was 3,286, having 89,050 pupils, a number equal to 2.35 per cent. of the whole 
population. The primary schools numbered 3,238 and were attended by 87,750 pupils, 
of whom 6,677 were girls. The large majority of pupils at primary schools, namely, 
81,334, were Burmese. In 59 of the schools English was taught; the rest were ver- 
nacular schools. In 1882~’83 the total number of schools under inspection was 3,863, 
having 107,037 pupils, a number equal to 2.8 per cent. of the population and to 10 
percent. of the children between 5 and 15 years of age. 
Primary education was provided for in 3,857 schools, haying au average attendance 
of 105,387 pupils. The average number of girls attending English schools’ was 
1,050; the average number attending vernacular schools was not shown; but it is 
obseryed that of the total number of pupils on the rolls at the close of the year 8,196, 
or 7.8 per cent., were girls. 
Secondary instruction is carried on in. high and middle schools that numbered 39 
in 188182, having 1,074 pupils, viz, 981 boys and 93 girls, In 1882~83 the number 
of secondary schvols had increased to 43, attended by 1,074 boys and 115 girls. All 
these schools are classed as English except one. 
Under the head of special and technical schools an account is given of the three 
normal schools for training teachers, which, in 188182, numbered 99 students, and 145 
in 1882~83. In 1881-82 an extension of this branch of education was undertaken by 
establishing anormal class for Burmese schoolmistresses in connection with the Ameri- 
can Baptist mission school at Rangoon. Out of a total of 5 higher grade and 71 
lower grade certificates granted to normal students during 1882~83, 3 of the higher 
and 10 of the lower were awarded to candidates from the girls’ class. 
The government high school at Rangoon is the only institution with a college de- 
partment. Seventeen undergraduates studied in this department in 1882~’83 and two 
passed the first arts examination of the Calcutta University. 
Insumming up the information with reference to the education of girls in 1882~83, 
the chief commissioner says: 
From the statements it is observed that the number of institutions devoted to the 
education of girls increased from 21 in 1881-82 to 26 in the year under review. Of 
these 2 are classed as high, 8 as middle, and 16 as primary schools. There are besides   
1 Schools supported partly or wholly by local tax.

many schools which admit boys and girls. Of these the number is not stated in the 
report. The number of girls under instruction is shown as 8,394, as compared with 
6,770 in the previous year. One hundred and forty-five girls passed various exami- 
nations as compared with 121 in 188182. 
The chief commissioner has been much struck by the great success which has at- 
tended the opening of separate classes for girls under female teachers at several 
of the municipal schools which he has visited in the course of his recent tours. At 
Henzada he found 70 girls attending a class which had very recently been opened. 
The number paappecone far too large to be properly managed by the single teacher in 
charge of the class. At Yandoon, also, he found a capital girls’ department under a 
female teacher. It is evident that, if only good female teachers can be provided, the 
Burmese are ready and anxious to send their daughters to school. The training of 
schoolmistresses is accordingly a matter which the chief commissioner would specially 
commend to the attention of the director. An excellent example has been set by 
Miss Rathbun at the American Baptist mission school in Rangoon, one of whose 
pupils is mistress of the Henzada school. 
The expenditure on education in 1881~82 was 497,794 rupees and in 1882~’83 594,892 
rupees. 
Curna proper: Area, 537,590 square miles ; population, 350,000,000. 
\ Education is considered of the utmost importance in China, as it leads to rank, 
wealth, and influence. Even many of the literati become teachers. Self supporting 
day schools are universal and primary instruction is found in the remotest village. 
The government appoints state examiners, but does not otherwise assist in educating 
the masses. There is an absence of statistical publications in regard to public instruc- 
tion, yet M. Martin, director of the university at Pekin, estimates the proportion of 
illiterates for the whole empire above 10 years of age as 1 to 6, and for the countries 
of Northern China as 57 to the 1,000 or 1 to 18. The governmental examinations admit 
about 2,000,000 candidates each year, and 1 or 2 per cent. of these pass successfully. 
The public examinations take place in October, and persons of all ages throng from every 
part of the empire to the large cities to attend them. They many times bring their own 
tents and utensils, as each person must be in a separate establishment, without commu- 
nication with the outside world, during the period of the examinations. Each person 
is to show by an essay that he comprehends the ancient authors, that he can express 
himself with poetical elegance, and write a fine hand. History and geography are 
nottakenup. Thelaureates are admitted to the presence of the Emperor, which honor 
is felt in the family for generations, and the most distinguished receive employment 
under the administration. Others who are successful become licentiates (hsiu ts’ai). 
Each licentiate may open a school, and he is allowed to arrange the tuition fees. 
Those pupils who cannot pay him 6 tiaos (about half a dollar) a month are not consid- 
ered worth teaching. There are many private schools, There are also public schools, 
for which the Emperor furnishes the buildings and pays the teachers’ salaries. These 
imperial professors receive from 12 to 18 tails (taél=about $1.35) a month and two 
meals a day. Inspectors have the care of such schools, each of which consists of one 
class, with only 15 pupils as the maximum. If a private individual wishes to open 
a school for adults his salary is to be limited to 20 taéls and only 6 pupils are to be 
allowed at a time. Preliminary instruction is very long in Chinese schools, from 
the lack of alphabet, declensions, conjugations, and grammar; in fact, with nothing 
but words or characters, which must be memorized in a certain order, with all 
the affixes and prefixes which throw light on the phrase or word. A stumbling block 
in education is that the language of the school is different from that of the people. 
When a young man knows about 12,000 characters and can compose literary or poeti- 
cal essays he is ready to go up to the examination for licentiate. The university at 
Pekin, founded about 20 years ago, contains about 150 pupils who enter for the pur- 
pose of acquiring a knowledge of foreign branches, and who are paid for so doing. 
Professors from other countries teach French, English, German, Russian, geography, 
history, physics, chemistry, astronomy, &c,

Educational affairs are under the direction of a primary school inspector. As the 
people are mostly Anamites, primary teaching differs from that in the majority of the 
colonies, The primary schools number 443, with 473 instructors and 13,299 pupils 
(boys, 13,172; girls, 127). In these the Anamese tongue and the elements of French 
are taught. In the schools of first grade (so called) the children are taught to read 
and write in French, and also receive their first lessons in grammar, arithmetic, and 
geography. These schools number 7, with 47 professors (13 Europeans and 34 natives) 
and 1,062 pupils. They are located where the population is thickest. In the second 
grade schools the instruction is very similar to that of the French primary school; a 
3-year course is given. Only two establishments— the Collége Chasseloup-Laubat at 
Saigon and the college at Mytho—have adopted this method. , The professors number 
35; the pupils, 279. Eventually these two colleges will be considered as the first two 
years of secondary instruction. Private schools are found in many villages. The 
pupils are taught to read and write the Chinese or Cambodian characters. These 
schools are kept up by gifts from individuals or the pupils pay a modest sum towards 
the expenses. ‘About 414 private schools are reported, with 417 professors giving in- 
struction to 6,008 pupils (5,928 boys and 80 girls). The mission schools number 64; 
professors, 97; pupils, 3,384 (1,839 boys and 1,545 girls). 
JAPAN, absolute monarchy: Area, 156,604 square miles; population (1883), 36,700,118. Capital, Tokio; 
population, 823,557. Minister of public instruction, Fukuoka. 
According to a report on the Japanese school system, there were 5,615,007 children 
of school age inthe monarchy in 1881, as a census of that datestates. The school age, 
since the school law was revised in 1879-80, is 6-14. Attendance is obligatory in the 
common schools, which in 1881 numbered 28,901, including private schools organized 
like the public ones. There are 3 grades in these common schools, a 3-year course in 
the first two and a 2-year course in the last. The studies are: first year, morals, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, singing, and gymnastics; second year, elements of geog- 
raphy, history, drawing, natural history, and sewing (for girls); third year, elements 
of chemistry, physiology, geometry, national economy, or, in the school for girls, 
domestic economy. In certain sections of the country the elements of an agricult- 
ural, industrial, or commercial education enter into the course, which in that case is 
somewhat modified; but in any case instruction must be given in reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. ° 
The program of studies in the middle schools varies somewhat according to the 
needs of the youth of the quarter. There were 172 middle schools reported, with two 
divisions, one for elementary, the other for higher instruction, in each school. The 
studies at the school in Osaka serve as a model, viz: Lower course, moral teach- 
ings, Japanese and Chinese literature, English, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geog- 
raphy, history, physiology, zodlogy, botany, physi¢s, chemistry, national economy, 
book-keeping, calligraphy, drawing, singing, and gymnastics. This course lasts 4 
years. The higher course, lasting 2 years, continues morals, literature of China and 
Japan, English, book-keeping, drawing, singing, and gymnastics, and adds trigonome- 
try, mineralogy, Japanese code of laws, physics, and chemistry. 
The normal schools, 74 in number, have a threefold course, covering 1, 2}, and 4 
years. There are also model schools connected with these teachers’ seminaries. The 
one year course embraces morals, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, physics, 
pedagogy, school supervision and school practice, singing, and gymnastics. In the 
2h-year grade the same studies are continued, and history, drawing, physiology, nat- 
ural history, chemistry, geometry, and book-keeping are added. In the 4-year course 
are found the additional branches of algebra, national economy, Japanese legal lore, 
and psychology. This plan of study may be changed according to the wants of an 
industrial, commercial, or agricultural education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  ccL REPORT OF THH COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The normals for women follow out the same courses, only that instead of national 
economy and law they take up: domestic economy and needlework. In Tokio there 
are two model institutions for men and women desiring to become teachers. The 
one for males has two subdivisions, a 4-year course for those intending to teach in 
the common schools and another course (which is now undergoing some changes) for 
those who wish to be teachers of the middle grades. These courses take up the 
studies named above. The other, for women, which allows graduates to teach in 
any grade, has a 4-year course, covering morals, reading, narration, writing, arith- 
metic, geography, Japanese history, natural history, physics, chemistry, drawing, ped- 
agogy, practice in teaching, needlework, etiquette, domestic economy, singing, and 
gymnastics. A six-class school for girls—a lower grade school — serves for a practice 
school; a five-class higher grade is also connected with it. A school for children 
from 3 to 6 years, similar to the Kindergarten, is also a part of this teachers’ seminary. 
Seven of these infant schools are now in existence. 
A certificate of graduation, showing how much of the course the normal pupil has un- 
dertaken, entitles the holder toa teacher's position in some of the grades according tothe 
branchespursued. This certificate is good for7 years, but may be extended 7 years or for 
life. Examinations are also held for persons of 18 yearsof age or more who desire to take 
the position of teacher but who have not followed thenormal courses. A successful pass- 
ing of such examination before the proper authorities entitles the candidate to a grade 
of certificate equivalent to the studies examined in. The teacher is then allowed to 
fill a position within the district for a longer or a shorter period,in any case not 
upwards of 5 years, although then a renewal is permitted if the position has been ac- 
ceptably filled. 
The university at Tokio and the polytechnie school represent the highest grade of 
instruction, in addition tosome special schools. The four faculties embrace law, sciences, 
medicine, and literature. The legal studies include English, French, and Japanese 
Jaw, but not the Roman law. The sciences include mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
biology, astronomy, geology, civil and mining engineering. The medical department 
graduates physicians, pharmacists, and apothecaries, The literary course has four sec- 
tions: philosophy, politics, national economy, and Japanese and Chinese literature. 
Each course takes 4 years except the pharmaceutical, which requires 3 years, and the 
higher medical, which occupies 5 years. Two preparatory schools have special courses 
for the university. One, with a 3-year course, leads up to the legal, scientific, and 
literary departments; the other, four years in length, to the medical school. As- 
tronomical and meteorological observatories, a botanic garden, a chemical and a 
natural history museum, and two hospitals are all connected with the university. 
The technical high school, or school for engineers, has a 6-year course, two of which 
are preparatory. The English language, geography, the elements of mathematics] 
mechanics, and physics, chemistry, and geometrical and machine drawing are taught 
as preparation for the special courses in the construction of machines and ships, in 
telegraphy, architecture, practical chemistry, surveying, and mining. The instrue- 
tion is both theoretical (two years) and practical (two years). Museums, labora- 
tories, foundries, &c., aid greatly in rendering the students proficient. 
Special schools are scattered among the cities and districts of Japan. Accord- 
ing to the needs of the people around, there are either medical, pharmaceutical, legal, 
agricultural, or commercial institutions, or, perhaps, schools for students of natura, 
sciences, mathematics, literature, drawing, architecture, seamanship, &e. Far more 
schools are devoted to medicine than to any other branch. A 4-year course leads to the 
degree of M. D.; a 3-year course produces physicians of the second class. There are 
similar courses for those desiring to become druggists, but the studies are limited 
to 2 and 3 years. There are 2 special schools—one for languages and one for 
teachers of gymnastics—in Tokio. The first, in a 5-year course, gives instruction 
in French, German, Russian, Chinese, English, and the Corean tongues. The second 
pays more attention to physical development, yet it includes Japanese, Chinese, and

English literature, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, anatomy, physiology, physics, hy- 
giene, and drawing. The course is of two years’ duration. There are also army and 
navy institutes; schools of agriculture, forestry, and veterinary science; 3 commer- 
cial or trade schools; many private establishments; a school of technology (especially 
for chemical and mechanical branches); various institutions for the deaf, dumb, and 
blind ; so-called ‘‘ Japanese” schools, where the history, literature, poetry, and ancient 
art of Japan are taught; German schools; schools of etiquette and for woman’s handi- 
work, needlework, &c, 
The school system is benefited materially by the numerous libraries, pedagogical 
museums, and collections of apparatus which are found in the capital and in the 
provinces. * Students are sent at government expense to foreign lands to study edu- 
cational systems. Conferences are held in different districts, so that there may be an 
exchange of thought on school matters, and the minister of education gathers his 
aids around him from time to time fora like purpose. Japan is divided into 44 school 
districts, with the prefect at the head of the educational system in each, but each of 
these districts is subdivided and under supervision of an inspector, all of these offi- 
cials being subject to the commands of the minister of education. There are also 
school boards having certain duties in the communal departments. Religious orders 
have nothing to do with schools in Japan. With the exception of the governmental 
schools, the different sections are supposed to furnish funds for their own immediate 
schools; still help is given if the district funds do not hold out. When new school 
buildings are to be erected, the government furnishes the ground, if possible; all 
school grounds are free from taxation. 
The Japanese school system is not yet fully developed and some reforms are seon 
to be made, but the prospects are said to be excellent. The greatest trouble so far 
seems to be in the lack of money in a few districts and in the lack of cultivation 
among the teachers. This last, it is thonght, will be done away with as the teacher 
realizes more fully what is expected of him.

Care oF Goon Horr, British colony: Area, 239,805 square miles ; population, 1,155,168. Capital, Cape 
Town. Superintendent general of education, Langham Dale. 
Since 1860 the aided school system has been extending its operations in this colony. 
Theoretically it presents a very elaborate and complete gradation of schools, extend- 
ing from the elementary schools to the university and adapted to all the classes and 
races that make up the population ofthe colony. Practically, the results accomplished 
have not proved satisfactory, and in 1882 Donald Ross, previously well known as one 
of Her Majesty’s inspectors in Scotland, was appointed inspector general of colleges 
and schools, with instructions to investigate and report in full upon the educational 
affairs of the Cape. His preliminary report gave an interesting survey of the field 
and evinced a wonderful power in the observation, analysis, and classification of 
practical details. His death, which followed almost immediately upon the comple- 
tion of this report, brought to an end one of the most promising investigations ever 
undertaken in the interests of education. For reasons that may be readily inferred 
from the condition of the colony, it is not easy to gather reliable school statistics. 
Mr. Ross concluded that one-sixth of the children of school age in the colony attend 
schools with beneficial results, while five-sixths are still outside the government 
system; of the latter number he estimated that about 6,500, mostly children of the 
superior class, were under private instruction.

CCLIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Of the total population the Europeans number about 250,000. It is estimated that 
one-half the children of this portion of the community are under instruction. Mr. 
Ross dwelt particularly upon the want of competent teachers, which the superin- 
tendent general had ‘also long recognized as a great obstacle to the progress of the’ 
schools. The most satisfactory feature in the system at present seems to be the sup- 
ply of good buildings and apparatus, in which respect Mr. Ross was of the opinion 
that the colony surpassed what England had accomplished up to 1870. 
The following statistics are from the report of the superintendent general for 1882: 
Number of aided schools, 960; annual enrolment, 75,314; daily attendance, 37,316;

Each of the seven provinces forming the Dominion of Canada has power to regulate 
its own local affairs, including education, so faras may be done without interfering 
with the policy and action of the central administration under the governor general, 
Public instruction in most of the provinces is under the control of a council of edu- 
cation and of one or more superintendents, according as the religious element is or is 
not recognized. Full information upon this point is embodied in my annual report

The following information is derived from the report of the education department 
for 1883 and the statistical report for 1882: 
School population and attendance.—The number of children between 7 and 13 years 
of age reported as not attending any school for 110 days during the year is 87,444, 
The number between 7 and 13 not attending any school whatever was 8,086, or less 
than 2 per cent. of the whole school population. By the school act of 1881, now in 
force, the parent or guardian of every child between the ages of 7 and 13 is required 
to cause such child to attend a public school for 11 weeks in each of the two terms 
of the public school year, and the attendance must be during the whole time in each 
week, except in cases where half time is allowed. 
The average attendance, viz, the aggregate daily attendance divided by the number 
of legal teaching days in the year, being 222 days for rural and 211 for urban schools, 
was 214,176. The percentage of average attendance, as compared with total number 
attending school, is, for rural districts, 43; cities, 58; towns, 53; province, 45, The 
percentage of pupils under 5 to the total number attending school is 0.28; for pupils 
between 5 and 16, 96.96; for those between 17 and 21, 2.66; and for those over 21, 0.10. 
Nine per cent. of the pupils attended for less than 20 days during the year, 17 per 
cent. from 20 to 50 days, 25 per cent. 51 to 100 days, 22 per cent. 101 to 150 days, 23 
per cent, 151 to 200 days, 4 per cent. 201 days to whole year. 
Teaching force.—In the 5,203 schools reported, 6,857 teachers were employed, of 
whom 3,062 were male teachers and 3,795 female teachers. There were 733 more fe- 
male than male teachers. Highestsalary paid to a male teacher in a county was $900; 
the lowest, $120; in a city, the highest, $1,100; the lowest, $400; in a town, the 
highest, $1,000 ; the lowest, $240. ‘The average salary of male teachers in counties 
was $385 ; of female teachers, $248 ; in cities, of male teachers, $742; of female teach- 
ers, $331; in towns, of male teachers, $576 ; of female teachers, $273. The number of 
teachers who had attended the normal schools at Toronto or Ottawa was 1,873, an in- 
crease of 74. 
High schools.— Number of schools, 104; number of pupils, 12,473. The amount re- 
ceived by the high school board from legislative grant for the salaries of teachers 
was $84,304; increase, $1,016. The amount of municipal grants in support of high 
schools was $196,438 ; decrease, $4,375. The amount received for pupils’ fees was 
$29,269 ; decrease, $1,621. Balances of the preceding year and other sources, $63,137 ;

Jamaica, British colony: Area, including Turk’s Island, 4,362 square miles ; population, 585,536. Cap- 
ital, Spanish Town; population, 6,000. Inspector of schools, Thomas Capper. 
The following information is derived from the annual report of the inspector of 
schools for the year ending September 30, 1882: 
Number of schools inspected, 677; number receiving aid, 627; number of pupils 
registered, 53,366; average attendance, 29,894; amount of grants in aid, 18,2251. 
With respect to school attendance the inspector says: 
The a ulation Seana all schools receiving government aid to be open for at 
least 180 days in the year has been very generally disregarded. The ed eae of 
scholars on the books of schools under government inspection to the whole number 
of children in the island between the ages of 5 and 15 is almost exactly 30 per cent. 
But low as this percentage undoubtedly is, it must not be inferred from it, as some 
suppose, that 70 per cent. of the children in the island go without any education. 
The figures would be the same if every child in the island attended school regularly 
for three years, which, unfortunately, is far from being the case. To putitin another 
way, the children of Jamaica have on an average three years each in an elementary 
school, which, if they attended regularly and were well taught, would be quite suf- 
ficient to give them a better education than the great majority of them actually get. 
In the course of those three years, however, they only attend on an average five- 
ninths of the school days, broken up in most cases into detached portions, so as to 
produce the smallest possible good results. 
As a means of improving the teaching force, regulations were published in August 
last under which certificates will be granted, on the results of an examination to be 
held annually, to teachers, and, after a probationary period of two years, to outgoing 
students of training colleges. To holders of these certificates an annual bonus will be 
paid of 51., 101., or 15l., according to the class of their school at the annual inspec- 
tion. Provision is also made for the payment of a sum of 151. to such voluntary 
training colleges as apply for examination, for every resident student who passes. 
The standard to be attained is such that nearly all capable teachers in the island 
should be able to secure a certificate within two or three years.

There are no statistics of primary education covering the whole country of Mexico 
later than 1875. A French gentleman, M.A. Dupin de Saint André, has made a re- 
port to the French minister of public instruction on education in Mexico, from which 
the following details are taken: 
The reorganization, or rather the organization, of primary instruction in Mexico 
was effected in 1867, since which time considerable progress has been made and numerous 
schools have been established. In 1875 instruction was made obligatory in 19 out 
of 29 states, viz, in Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Coahuila, Campeche, Guanajuato, 
Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Morelos, Nuevo-Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Sinaloa, Sonora,

San Luis Potosi, Tlaxcala, Vera Cruz, Distrito federal, and Baja California. In 
some of these states (Aguacalientes, Campeche, Michoacan, Jalisco, Morelos, Nuevo- 
Leon, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Vera Cruz, San Luis Potosi, and Guerrero) parents and guar- 
dians who do not send their children to school are fined and may be sent to prison. 
In others (Puebla and Coahuila) the delinquents are brought before the police magis- 
trates, while in Sonora, the federal district, and Lower California children who go 
regularly to school receive a reward, and all public employment is refused to the 
fathers who neglect to comply with the requirements of the law. 
The program of primary instruction embraces reading, writing, Spanish grammar, 
arithmetic, weights and measures, morals, and politeness. In most of the schools 
instruction in geography, drawing, and natural history and in the rights and duties 
of citizenship are added to these obligatory subjects. Girls are taught sewing. In 
the City of Mexico the school programs are of wider scope and include geometry, 
algebra, general history, and Frei ch. 
In 1875 (date of the latest statistics) there were 8,103 primary schools in Mexico, 
conducted by the government, the municipalities, or by corporations and individuals, 
They are subdivided as follows: government schools, 603; municipal, 5,240; main- 
tained by corporations or private parties, 378; by the clergy, 117; private schools, 
1,581; unclassified, 184. Instruction is gratuitous in all, except some of the private 
schools. The schools belonging to the clergy, as shown above, are not numerous. 
Clericalism is powerless in Mexico. This fact is all the more extraordinary because 
the country is Roman Catholic and the Indians are still the humble servants of the 
padres. But sangre azul Mexicans dislike the priests. They are anxious to rescue 
the country from their influence and hope to succeed in their project by increasing 
the number of governmental or communal schools. 
Divided as to sex and age, the Mexican schools are classified as follows: Primary 
schools for boys, 5,567; for girls, 1,594; mixed schools, 548; adult male, 124; adult 
female, 21; unclassified, 249; total, 8,103. The number of pupils in the 8,103 schools 
was 349,000. This is not a large number in proportion to the 800,000 children of 
school age in the country. But, although the Mexican Republic is three times as 
large as France, the population is scattered, the schools are not nearly se numerous 
as they should be, and the illiterate Indians have no conception of the value of edu- 
cation, These causes sufficiently account’ for the ignorance of which so much com- 
plaint is made and for which there is no remedy except the establishment of schools 
in all the remotest villages. In 1875 the confederation, the states, the municipali- 
ties, and the corporations expended $1,633,436 for primary education, of which nearly 
$417,000 came from the confederation, the corporations giving $173,000. The rest 
came from State funds and municipalities. 
The number of secondary and professional schools in 1875 was 54, with 9,337 pupils. 
This is exclusive of the ecclesiastical seminaries, which numbered 24, with 3,800 stu- 
dents. There were also 15 secondary schools for girls, with an attendance of 2,300 
students. 
Yucaran, Mexican state: Arca, 29,567 square miles; population, 302,319. Capital, Merida; popula- 
tion, 9,727. 
From a report presented by the president of the council of public instruction of Yu- 
catan to the governor of that state we obtain the following statistics: The number 
of primary schools in 1882~’83 was 227, an increase of 37 over the previous year. Of 
these, 170 were boys’ and 57 were girls’ schools. The total attendance was 8,216, and 
of this number 6,041 were boys and 2,174 were girls, The previous year the attend- 
ance was 9,600, composed of 7,500 boys and 2,100 girls, thus showing a decrease. The 
annual expenditure was 71,220 pesos ($63,671), of which sum 43,068 pesos were ap- 
propriated from the public treasury and 28,152 pesos were contributed by the vari- 
ous municipalities. 
There are a normal school; a literary institute for girls, which had an attendance of 
177 pupilsin 1882; the Literary Institute of Yucatan, which gives both primary and sec-

ondary instruction and was attended by 174 students in 1882; a public museum; and a 
library of 1,340 volumes. The literary institute of Valladolid, which gives primary 
instruction, had an attendance of 57 pupils in 1882, The medical school at Merida 
had 50 students the same year, while the law school had 53 students.

ARGENTL Rerupiic: Area, 515,700 square miles; population, 2,830,000. Capital, Buenos Ayres; 
population, 295,000. Minister of justice, worship, and public instruction, Dr. Eduardo Wilde. 
  The following information is taken from an official report on the condition of edu- 
cation in the Argentine Republic in 1882 by Dr. Benjamin Zorrilla, president of the 
national commission on education, The commission was established in 1882 for the 
purpose of examining and reporting upon the condition of education in the republic 
during that year. 
The first act of the commission was to take a school census of the city of Buenos 
Ayres, so as to determine the number of children of school age (5 to 14 years) in that 
city, the number attending the public and private schools, those receiving instruc- 
tion at home, and those who receive no instruction whatever. The census showed 
that there were 44,170 children of school age whose parents are required by law to 
send them to school, and 19,543 children enrolled in the public schools in May, 1882, 
with an attendance of 16,958, which figures rose in October to 21,698 enrolled, with 
an attendance of 17,885. 
There has been a gradual increase in school attendance in the last few years. To go 
back twenty-five years, there were 6,427 children at school in Buenos Ayres in 1856, 
according to information in the possession of the department of education. The 
census of 1869 showed that the total population of the province of Buenos Ayres, in- 
cluding the city, was 495,107, and that 28,373 children attended the public and private 
schools. In the city alone in 1882 there were 21,698 children enrolled at the public 
and 11,493 at the private schools, making a total of 33,191, or 4,818 more than at- 
tended school in the whole province in 1869. The population of the city in 1881 was 
289,925, while in 1869 it was 177,790, 
A comparison of the enrolment and attendance in the years 1880, 1881, and 1882 at 
the public schools shows a constant increase. Thus in 1880 the enrolment was 16,637 
and attendance 13,422; in 1881 the corresponding figures were 18,023 and 14,714; and 
in 1882, 21,698 and 17,885, which shows an increase of 5,000 children in the enrol- 
ment during those three years, The number of schools in 1882, besides normal schools, 
was 168, divided into 5 graded, 94 elementary, 53 infant, 14 night, 1 Sunday school, 
and 1 Kindergarten. The total number of teachers was 437, The sum of $137,000 was 
paid for the rent of 150 buildings for school purposes, including that occupied by the 
national educational commission. 
The number of private schools in Buenos Ayres was 118, of which 46 were for boys, 
19 for girls, and 53 mixed. The attendance in September, 1882, was 6,777 boys and 
4,716 girls, a total of 11,493. The number enrolled in the public schools at the 
same time was 21,698, so that the entire number of children enrolled in the schools 
was 33,191. There were, besides, 697 pupils of the public normal schools, 225 students 
at the national college in the first and second years (who still belonged to the school 
population), and 1,323 children who received instruction at home, making a total of 
35,436 children receiving instruction out of the 46,000 of school age in the city. The 
number 46,000 represents the number of children of school age better than the census 
figure, 44,170, because many persons did not give the number of their own children or 
of others living in théir houses who were of school age. 
The law of September 25, 1871, organizing public instruction, had gone into effect 
in all the provinces of the republic by the end of 1882. Under this law school com- 
missioners are appointed in each province, who are independent of the local govern- 
ments and who administer the funds appropriated for school purposes. The law 
specifies the sources from which the appropriation shall be made.

EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. CCLIX 
In the province of Buenos Ayres 70 new school buildings were in course of con- 
struction in 1882. The total number at tho close of that year was 324, with 276 male 
and 294 female teachers and 22,498 pupils (of whom 12,102 were boys and 10,396 
girls), The average attendance was 16,742. The number of schools in 1881 was 248 
and of pupils 18,451. 
The province of Santa Fé made no returns for the year 1882, and therefore had no 
share in the national subyention for education. 
The census of 1869 showed 7,188 pupils-of both sexes in the public and priyate 
schools of the province of Entre Rios, out of 27,709 children of school age. Since 
then the school attendance has not increased, while the number of children of school 
age has kept pace with the increase of population. The number of children attend- 
ing the public schools in 1882 was 3,777; the enrolment was 4,217 (2,399 of whom 
were boys and 1,818 girls). There were 64 schools, with 64 male and 57 female teachers, 
The average monthly pay of all the teachers was 44.64 pesos fuertes (about $45). 
The total school attendance did not exceed 7,000. 
The province of Corrientes, like San Luis, Santa Fé, and others, has passed excel- 
lent laws on primary education, which have not been rigidly enforced, on account of 
the apathy and indifference of the public. In 1882 there were in that province 101 
schools, with 151 teachers (88 male and 63 female) and an enrolment of 4,928 children 
(of whom 2,977 were boys and1,951 girls). The attendance was 4,420. The total 
paid for salaries was 2,680 pesos fuertes a month. In 1869 the school attendance, pub- 
lic and private, was put down at 6,569. The returns for 1882 only give the public 
schools, but it is probable that there has been no increase in the attendance at private 
schools since the earlier date. 
Cordova is the second province of the republic in population. It has no law upon 
primary instraction but the legislature votes a certain amount of money for that 
branch of education every year. Its university and the Colegio de Monserrat receive 
much attention from the legislature and the public, but primary education is neg- 
lected. In 1872 the city of Cordova had 2 public schools, with 42 pupils; in 1882 the 
number had increased to 20 schools, with 1,698 pupils. The province has a population 
nearly equal to that of the city of Buenos Ayres, so that it may be assumed that it 
contains 46,000 children of school age. In 1872 the province had 39 public schools, 
with 1,559 pupils. In 1882 there were 102 schools, with 6,611 pupils. More children, 
therefore, attend the private schools of the city of Buenos Ayres than are taught 
in all the schools of Cordova. In the 102 schools there were 147 teachers (76 male 
and 71 female), the number of pupils enrolled was 6,611 (3,976 boys and 2,635 girls), 
and the attendance was 5,692. 
The legislature of the province of San Luis passed a now law on public primary 
education on March 14, 1883, some of the principal features of which are as follows: 
It makes primary instruction obligatory and gratuitous. An annual census is es- 
tablished to determine the number of children of school age and a fine is imposed upon 
the parents or guardians for non-enrolment and non-attendance of such children at 
school. A provincial educational commission is established, with a president, council, 
and other officers, and district inspectors are appointed under the commission. The 
duties and powers of the commission are to administer the school fund, appoint and 
discharge employés (discharges are to be made for sufficient reasons only), take 
the school census, draw up regulations and programs for the schools, visit and in- 
spect the schools twice a year (and oftener if necessary), suggest improvements to the 
executive, prepare an annual report, appoint and remove teachers, build or buy 
school-houses, propose new taxes to increase the school fund, ‘receive gifts or lega- 
cies, demand dispossession of land necessary for school purposes, draw up annually 
a general budget for all school districts and forward it to the executive, keep an 
account of the receipts and expenditures of the commission, recommend the estab- 
lishment of public libraries, deposit the fands it receives in the national bank, 
collect the subsidies granted by the general and provincial governments for school

purposes, receive and distribute books and apparatus, &c., for educational pur- 
poses, and arrange for collecting taxes destined for the school fund. The members of 
the commission are responsible for the property administered by it. The commission 
has the right of representation in court. The president has control of the employés 
of the commission. His powers and duties are to preside over the commission, and he 
may votein caseofatie. His signature, together with that of the secretary, legalizes 
the acts of the commission, and he communicates such acts to the proper functionaries. 
His duties are, further, to draw up and submit to the commission the regulations atfect- 
ing the powers and duties of the employés thereof; to authorize payments and col- 
lect, distribute, and advise upon the various appropriations ; to execute the disposi- 
tions made by the commission for distributing school furniture, books, &c. ; to inspect 
the schools of the capital and to recommend improvements in instruction; to conduct an 
official journal containing decrees, &c., on primary instruction ; to superintend school 
inspection ; to prepare an annual report and a budget; and to become a party to any 
suit or action involving school funds or property. The duties of the inspectors are to 
inspect and report upon the competency of the teachers, prevent them from using other 
text books than those adopted by the commission, notice the attendance of the teach- 
ers and verify their returns of attendance of the pupils, keep the commission informed 
of the hygienic conditions of the schools and the condition of the buildings, furniture, 
&c., and attend to the fulfilment of the regulations of the commission and to the collec- 
tion of taxes for the school fund in each district. The law then specifies the sources 
from which money is to be derived for the school fund. They include certain fines and 
penalties, a percentage of gifts and legacies and of property left by persons dying intes- 
tate, proceeds of the sale of public lands, taxes on wills,the income from certain 
rights and privileges, and the subsidies from the national and provincial legisla- 
tures. The receivers of these moneys, appointed by the executive authority, render an 
account thereof to the commission of education, and they act in concert with said 
commission on all matters affecting the disposition of such moneys. 
The salaries of the officers of the central commission, of the inspectors, and other 
employés are to be determined annually by the budget for that year and be paid by 
the commission itself. The teachers are required to present their pay estimates to 
the district inspectors every four months, and the latter send the same to the com- 
mission. Every person who has established or desires to establish a private school 
must prove to the inspector of the district that the branches which are required as a 
minimum in the public schools are taught in his school. This is to permit the chil- 
dren in private schools to be exempt from attendance at the public schools. Pri- 
vate schools are required to give the statistics demanded by the inspectors and the com- 
mission and to be subject to supervision and inspection by the inspectors as far as 
the morality of the instruction and the hygienic conditions of the school are con- 
cerned. 
The commission will establish two endowments for boys and girls in the normal 
schools of each school district. The beneficiaries of these endowments are bound to 
serve four years in the schools of the province. The number of subsidized schools in 
the province of San Luis at the end of 1882 was 78, with 116 teachers (55 male and 
61 fémale) and 4,047 enrolled pupils, of whom 2,298 were boys and 1,749 were girls. 
The attendance was 3,653. The average monthly pay of the teachers was 27.87 pesos 
fuertes (about $28). The census of 1869 showed 2,216 children attending the public 
and private schools, so that the subsidized schools now have an attendance which is 
nearly double the total number of children who went to school fourteen years ago. 
The province of Mendoza passed a law on public instruction on November 30, 1880, 
which is like those enacted by other provinces in the last few years. The school sta- 
tistics for 1882 show 61 public subsidized schools, with 64 male and 55 female teachers 
and 4,458 enrolled pupils (2,665 boys and 1,793 girls). The attendance was 3,843, In 
1869 the total attendance at public and private schools was 2,132. The province of 
fan Juan enacted a law on primary education in 1873, and as considerable attention

is paid to the subjectin that province many improvements have been introduced into the 
system which was adopted at that time. A proposed new law provides, among other _ 
things, that a school shall be established in every locality where there are 30 children 
of school age; that public schools shall be open to both sexes; that whenever the mean 
attendance at a school exceeds 30 pupils an assistant teacher shall be engaged ; that 
private schools shall submit to inspection and supply the statistical information re- 
quired by the general council within specified periods, under penalty of a fine. An 
additional fine will be imposed for refusing to supply the information desired or for 
giving false returns. Teachers will be required to obtain diplomas from a normal 
school or from the general council, In 1882 San Juan had 48 public subsidized 
schools, with 41 male and 77 female teachers and an enrolment of 5,031 children. 
In 1869 the census showed an attendance at all schools of 5,091 children. 
The province of Rioja is in an isolated situation, its soil is barren, and its mineral 
resources have only recently begun to be developed. It could hardly be expected, 
therefore, to contribute much to educational purposes. Nevertheless its legislature 
passed a law in July, 1882, which is in conformity with the national school law. It 
appropriated 16,000 pesos fuertes, to be deposited in the national bank subject to 
the order of the school commission. The latter was created by the same law and 
was also intrusted with the money of the national subvention. In 1882 there were 
69 public subsidized schools in the province, with 40 male and 45 female teachers and 
an enrolment of 4,120 pupils, of whom 2,295 were boys and 1,825 girls. The attend- 
ance was 3,796. The average monthly pay of the teachers was 14.92 pesos fuertes 
(about $15). In 1869 the attendance was 3,000. 
The group of the four provinces San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan and Rioja presents 
a more satisfactory state of things, as far as public elementary instruction is con- 
cerned, than the littoral provinces, except Buenos Ayres. 
The province of Catamarca was one of the first to respond to the national law by 
enacting one in conformity therewith, appointing commissions in the capital and 
the country districts and appropriating money for public instruction. But primary 
instruction made little progress under the original law, and a new law was passed in 
December, 1882, which reorganized the system of instruction and made additional 
appropriations to support the same. The number of public subsidized schools in 
the province in 1882 was 37, with 29 male and 21 female teachers and an enrol- 
ment of 2,443 children, of whom 1,601 were males and 842 females. The attendance 
was 2,077. The monthly pay of the teachers was 18.84 pesos fuertes. The public 
and private school attendance in 1869 was 2,622. f 
None of the requirements of the law of September 25, 1871, had been complied with 
in the province of Santiago up to the beginning of 1882. No school commission had 
been appointed and no funds had been raised for educational purposes. But this 
state of things will not last long, and a law has been proposed which is fully in ac- 
cord with the circular of April 10, 1882, and makes appropriations for school 
purposes. In the early part.of 1883 there were 34 public primary schools in the pro- 
vince, with 26 male and 16 female teachers. The enrolment was 1,117 boys and 566 
girls. The attendance was 1,679. The average monthly pay of the teachers was 
26.42 pesos fuertes. 
The province of Tucuman had not adopted a general law on primary education be- 
fore 1882. It regulated its schools in its own way, without reference to the national 
law on elementary education. The governor of the province, however, in his annual 
message to the provincial legislature, called attention to the importance of accepting 
the conditions of the law providing national aid for elementary instruction, and the 
province will, in all probability, shortly join in the general movement which has given 
an impulse to that branch of education in the last few years. In 1882 there were 64 
public elementary schools, with 58 male and 62 female teachers and an enrolment of 
3,186 boys and 2,912 girls. The attendance was 5,118. The average monthly pay of 
the teachers was 20.35 pesos fuertes, In 1869 there were 3,219 children attending the

public and private schools of the province. The legislature of the province voted 
23,563 pesos fuertes for primary instruction in 1882, and the municipalities 34,440 pesos 
fuertes additional. 
The constitution and school laws of the province of Salta provide for an annual 
school tax, which equalled the general estimate of the province in 1883. A periodical 
representing the interests of education is published under the auspices of the council. 
In 1882 there were 64 subsidized elementary public schools in the province, with 43 
male and 56 female teachers and an enrolment of 2,335 boys and 2,123 girls. The 
attendance was 3,990. The average monthly pay of tlie teachers was 35.82 pesos fu- 
ertes. In 1869 there were 2,885 children in the public and private schools of the 
province. 
In 1882 the province of Jujuy adopted the conditions of the national law on ele- 
mentary education, made suitable appropriations to supplement the national aid, ap- 
pointed a school commission, created a system of school inspection, and, in short, 
complied with all the requirements of that law. The number of subsidized public 
elementary schools in the province in 1882 was 28, with 19 male and 14 female teachers 
and an enrolment of 626 boys and 414 girls. The attendance was 1,035. The aver- 
age monthly pay of the teachers was 18 pesos fuertes. There is no record of the 
school attendance of 1869. 
The following table gives a summary of the foregoing information, together with 
some additional figures showing the condition of primary education in the colonies 
and the average monthly cost of each scholar in each province :

CCLXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION» 
Secondary education.—From a report presented to the national congress in 1883 by 
Dr. Eduardo Wilde, minister of justice, public worship, and instruction, the fol- 
lowing statistics of secondary instruction are taken. In the report regrets are ex- 
pressed that in consequence of insufficient appropriations the efficiency of the teach- 
ing force in the national colleges and normal schools has been seriously diminished, 
both as regards the number and permanence of the force and its energy and enthu- 
siasm. Attention is also called to the insufficient number of school buildings and 
their bad condition. . 
In the 14 national colleges of the country there were 1,116 students in 1881 gnd 
1,629 in 1882. In the 9 normal schools for boys there were 228 students in 1881 and 
306 in 1882. There were 6 normal schools for girls in 1881, with 272 pupils, and in 1882 
the number had increased to 8, with 335 pupils. 
Complaint is made that many students of the secondary schools do not complete 
their elementary education before entering them. Some of the teachers of the girls’ 
normal schools are foreigners. An idea of the character and scope of the instruc- 
tion given in the colleges may be obtained from the program of the National Col- 
lege of Corrientes: 5 
First year. The native language; reading; writing; grammar; geography; arithme- 
tic (including decimals, powers end roots, ay: sacred and ancient history; French. 
Second year. Native language; arithmetic (including elementary algebra and loga~ 
rithms); practical geometry and lineal drawing; geography and history (Argentine 
Republic and America) ; English and French. : 
‘hird year. Exercises in composition, &c.; algebra; book-keeping; French, English, 
Greek, and Roman history ; geography ; drawing. i 
Fourth year. Literature and rhetoric; geometry; trigonometry; Latin and Greek 
grammar; physics; history ; general review of geography. 
Fifth year. Literature and rhetoric; topography; physics; inorganic chemistry ; 
natural history; mental philosophy ; Latin and Greek ; review of history. 
Sixth year. Spherical trigonometry and cosmography ; organic chemistry ; natural 
history ; physiology and hygiene; moral philosophy; Latin ; general review of his- 
tory; civic instruction ; elements of political economy. 
Some teachers complain of the inadequacy of scientific teaching and of the insuffi- 
ciency of apparatus and material. 
Superior education and special institutions.—The National Academy of Sciences was 
founded in 1870, under President Sarmiento, as a faculty of mathematical and physical 
sciences at the University of Cordova, but that institution manifested so much op- 
position to the plan that the faculty was reorganized under its present name. It 
was afterwards reunited with the university. It publishes reports and other works 
and its members give instruction in the university. 
The university at Buenos Ayres had 40 professors and 761 students in 1882. Of the 
professors 15 were in the medical faculty,8 in the faculty of law and social science, 
and 17 in the faculty of physics and mathematics. Of the students 365 were in the 
medical, 215 in the law, and 181 in the physical and mathematical faculties. There 
were 2,684 medical lectures, 485 on law, and 1,629 on physical and mathematical sub- 
jects during the year. The library contained 6,834 volumes. 
The University of Cordova had 240 students in 1882. The mineralogical museum 
contained 9,000 specimens. There were, besides, a zodlogical museum, a cabinet of 
physical apparatus, a chemical laboratory, an anatomical museum, and histological, 
physiological, and pharmaceutical laboratories. The library contained about 8,000 
volumes. Complaint was made of the want of books. 
The engineering school at San Juan graduated 15 students in 1882. 
Besides these purely educational institutions, the national observatory at Cordova 
carried on astronomical observations, including celestial photography, and the meteor- 
ological bureau continuetl its observations; both were under the directorship of the 
American astronomer, B. A. Gould. The report of this officer for 1882 contains the 
results of observations taken at eight stations in different parts of the country, from

The latest information in regard to the educational system of this country is to be 
found in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1881. 
‘VENEZUELA, republic: Estimated area, 439,120 square miles; estimated population, 2,075,245. Capital, 
Carécas; population, 55,638. Minister of public instruction, Dr. A. Dominici. 
The following account of the Venezuelan school system was prepared by Mr. 
Horatio N. Beach, United States consul at Puerto Cabello: 
Until recent years there has not been in Venezuela anything that could properly be 
denominated a school system. Prior to 1879, the period of the incoming of the pres- 
ent president, there were no public schools. There existed in the larger towns a few 
private schools, having a very restricted attendance. President Guzman Blanco, 
since his last advent as chief magistrate, has inspired the establishment and mainte- 
nance of public schools. 
The principal school is the university at Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, a spacious 
and well arranged edifice, with a large and able faculty, the institution giving a 
classical education. It receives government aid. 
Aside from the university named there are no buildings erected for school purposes 
in the country. The school system will be best explained by saying that the seantey 
has seven states, each state divided into two legislative or judicial districts. Eac 
district has a chief, who, together with the municipal officers, administers the city and 
village governments; he also administers the governent of the rural population and 
manages the schools. The expense of conducting the schools is shared between the 
national government and the district governments. 
There being no public school-houses, the plan has been adopted of giving a teacher 
astipulated price per quarter, the compensation to include instruction and a furnished 
school room. The ‘‘furniture” is often quite scant in the school rooms, there being 
nothing more than miscellaneous sized boxes and kegs that are utilized as seats. 
Nearly all the schools are conducted under this system. In some of the cities a par- 
tial exception is made, a portion of the scholars being provided with instruction rooms 
Jeased for the purpose. ‘The teachers in these schools are paid a monthly sum for in- 
struction alone. ‘These leased school rooms are provided with blackboards, wooden 
benches with backs, and ordinary tables for writing. 
The teachers who provide school rooms are paid from $40 to $80 per quarter. Those 
teaching in rooms provided by the authorities are paid from $15 to $40 per month. 
The school hours are from 8 to 11 in the forenoon and 2 to 5 in the afternoon. In 
the cities the sexes are educated separately. There are no restrictions or distinctions 
on account of raceorcolor. As before indicated, tuition is free to allscholars. ‘There 
are no rate bills and no school tax, 
The language generally taught is the Spanish and the books in use are intended 
to impart only a rudimentary education in reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and 
geography. 
At present only about one-tenth of the adult population can read or write, which, 
however, is a much better percentage for education thin a few years ago would have 
shown. Of course literature is very circumscribed. In the cities the public journals 
do not have more than one subscriber to each 300 population, and in the villages and 
more rural communities the proportion of subscribers and readers is much less. In 
the cities there are many highly educated people, who in the main received their edu- 
cation in the United States and Europe. But the cause of education is progressing 
slowly, like nearly everything else in the way of advancement, yet in the right di- 
rection.

all classes, employing 314 teachers and having an enrolment of 8,046 pupils. Three- 
fourths of the children in the country were being educated in the public schools, while 
about one-fourth were cared Yor in the private schools. Considerably more than half 
of the children of the natio were under training in the English language, while the 
remainder were instructed. in the Hawaiian language. 
The tables show an exvess of 1,010 boys over girls in attendance upon the schools. 
This is in part accounted for by the tendency to early marriage in the case of the 
girls, but the presideut observes that it is in a measure attributable to unknown 
causes. Progress is ‘aoted in almost every particular: enrolment and average daily 
attendance are greater than in any previous report, many new school-houses have 
been built, and school accommodations and equipment have been greatly improved 
and increased. /, teachers’ association has been formed that promises good results in 
awakening enthusiasm and extending the knowledge of the best methods of instruc- 
tion and discipline. Progress is also shown in the growing interest of parents and 
the public generally. 
During the year 1882 the inspector general of schools, by direction of the board, 
prepared 2, course of study for the government select schools. Th¢ course comprises 
twelve grades, each corresponding to one year, beginning with the entrance of the pu- 
pil to the primary and progressing with easy gradations each year until the pupil is 
prepared for college, for teaching, or for business. Promotions are based on annual 
and term examinations. 
Tae amount of school tax paid over to the several school agents throughout the 
kingdom for 1881 was $46,872; the amount of school fund in the Hawaiian treasury 
giarch 31, 1882, bearing 12 per cent. interest per annum, was $44,629.38, 
New South Waxzs, British colony : Area, 316,320 square miles ; estimated population, 817,468. Capital, 
Sydney; population (1881), 220,627. Minister of public instruction, G. H. Reid. 
The following information is from the report of the minister for 1882:. 
Means of education.—(a) Provided at the public expense: The Sydney Grammar 
School, 1; public schools, 1,229; provisional schools, 188; half time ‘and third time 
schools, 81; evening schools, 36 ; certified denominational schools, 124 ; orphan schools, 
2, and ieaeecral schools 2. (b) Provided at private expense : School for the deaf and 
dumb and the blind, 1; ragged schools, 3; private schools, 491; total number of 
schools, 2,158. 
Number of children from 4 to 15 years of age, December, 1882 (estimated), 222,426; 
net enrolment in the schools of the department, 167,989 ; number of children receiving 
instruction through other agencies, so far as can be ascertained, 38,890. 
With reference to these figures the minister observes: That in any community 
206,879 out of a population of 817,468 (ie., one im every four persons) ean be under 
instruction in ordinary schools or at home, seems well-nigh impossible, and such a 
phenomenon, it is believed, has never yet been observed in any country. This point 
cannot be definitely cleared up, however, until some more effective mode of obtain- 
ing complete educational statistics than that now existing has been devised and 
brought into operation. 
While the record of enrolment is fiattering to the colony, the minister expresses re- 
gret that such a limited proportion of the children attend school for a sufficient length 
of time for the instruction to be efiective. Thus, in 1¢82 the number of pupils enrolled 
in the day schools was: For the whole year, 76,554, being 45.95 per cent. ; for three 
quarters only, 23,542, being 14.13 per cent. ; fortwo quarters only, 34,004, being 20.41 
per cent. ; for one quarter only, 32,504, eae 19.51 per cent. 
The average attendance for the year was 90,944; total number of eed 2,926 5 
number of persons constituting the inspectorial staff, 26; the number of pupils enrolled 
in the training school for the year, 94, viz: 40amen and 54 women; total sum avail- 
able for the operations of the department, 648,8101. 9s. 2d.; total expenditure for the 
year, 618,800/. 88, 9d.

The deaf and dumb institution was attended by 31 pupils; the articulation method 
is employed to the exclusion of all others. The course of instruction includes reading 
and writing in the first instance, followed by English composition, arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, history, drawing, elementary science, &c. The girls are also instructed in sew- 
ing, knitting, and other useful domestic accomplishments. The pupils, who are all 
resident boarders, under the watchful supervision of Mr. and Mrs. Van Asch and the 
assistants, occupy three separate dwellings, situated at convenient distances from one 
another. There is also a detached school-house. Besides the gardens attached to the 
residences, there are ample playgrounds and abundant facilities for recreation pur- 
poses. The locality is salubrious. The institution is subject to regular medical in- 
spection, and it is visited, from time to time, by the minister of education and officers 
of the department. 
The number of children on the rolls of the industrial schools December 31, 1882, 
was 1,040. The colony is well supplied with secondary schools, twenty of which 
made report to the government for the year. 
Provision is also made for superior education in the University of New Zealand, 
University of Otago, the Canterbury College, and the University College at Auckland, 
which last was established by act of the general assembly in 1882.

Schools of design have been established at twenty-five places in Victoria, in con- 
nection with a royal commission for promoting technological and industrial instrue- 
tion. Each school receives 2s. 6d. from government for every pupil who attends at 
least eight times in one quarter, besides which, fees varying from 2s. to 10s. per quar- 
ter are paid by pupils. The number of pupils on the rolls December 31, 1882, was

during the quarter ending with that day. 
Among important educational agencies may be mentioned the Melbourne Public 
Library, which has cost 111,6041. and is still unfinished; the National Gallery, con-

CCLXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. 
The invaluable Report of the Royal (English) Commissioners on Technical 
Instruction comes in while my report is in press, and it seems best to substitute the 
conclusions of the commissioners for other subjects. They are as follows: 
PROGRESS OF MANUFACTURE ABROAD. 
It will have been seen from the preceding pages of this report that we have at- 
tached considerable relative importance to that portion of our ecmmission which di- 
rected us to inquire into the condition of industry in foreign countries; and it is our 
duty to state that, although the display of continental manufactures at the Paris 
International Exhibition in 1878 had led us to expect great progress, we were not 
prepared for soremarkablea development of their natural resources, nor for such perfec- 
tion in their industrial establishments as we actually found in France, in Germany, in 
Belgium, and in Switzerland. Much machinery of all kinds is now produced abroad 
equal in finish and in efficiency to that of this country, and we found it in numerous 
instances applied to manufactures with as great skill and intelligence as with us. 
In some branches of industry, more especially in those requiring an intimate ac- 
quaintance with organic chemistry, as, for. instance, in the preparation of artificial 
colors from coal tar, Germany has unquestionably taken the lead. 
The introduction by Solvay, of Brussels, of the ammonia process for the manufact- 
ure of soda and the German application of strontia in sugar refining constitute new 
departures in those arts. In the economical production of coke we are now only 
slowly following in the footsteps of our continental neighbors, while the experiments 
which have been carried on for nearly a quarter of a century in France for recover- 
ing the tar and ammonia in this process haye only quite recently engaged our atten- 
tion. . 
The ventilation of deep mines by means of exhausting fans was brought to perfec- 
tion in Belgium earlierthan with us, and although our methods of sinking shafts served 
for many years as models for other countries, improvements thereon were made abroad 
which we are now adopting with advantage. 
The abundant water power in Switzerland and in other mountainous districts is 
utilized for motive purposes by means of turbines perfect in design and execution. 
The construction of the dynamo-machine by Gramme gave the first impulse to the 
eneral use of electricity for lighting and to the various new applications of that 
fie which appear likely to exercise so great an influence upon the industry of the 
world; and in all these applications at least as much activity is exhibited on the 
continent as with us. 
In the construction of roofs and bridges, more especially in Germany, accurate 
mathematical knowledge has been usefully applied to the attainment of the neces- 
sary stability with the least consumption of materials. 
Certain printed cottons of the highest class, produced at Mulhouse from Parisian de- 
signs, are not excelled, and rarely equalled, in this or in any other country, although 
the distance between our general productions in this department and those of Alsace 
is no longer so great as it was ten or twenty yearsago. The soft, all-wool fabrics 
of Rheims and Roubaix are scarcely equalled as yet on the average by those of 
Bradford, especially as respects the dyeing. 
Silk dyeing and finishing is still as much the specialty of Lyons as is the produc- 
tion of the beautiful silk fabrics on its hand looms, for which it hasso long been pre- 
eminent. 
The export from Verviers to Scotland of woollen yarns, carded and spun by ma- 
chinery made in England, from South American wool formerly purchased in Liver- 
pool and London, but for which Antwerp is now becoming the chief market, is an 
instance of an intelligent, careful, and persevering attention to details having e 
lished a special trade which the cheaper labor of the Belgian factories now assists 
in preserving. 
The ribbon trade of Basle, that in velvets andsilks of every kind at Crefeld and in 
mixed fabrics at Chemnitz, are examples of recently established or transformed in- 
dustries which have rarely been excelled in boldness of enterprise and in success by 
anything of the same kind accomplished in our own country. And it may not be im- 
proper to mention here that in whatever degree the technical instruction of our 
continental rivals may have trained them for competition with ourselves in their own, 
in neutral, and to some extent in our home markets, much of their success is due to 
more painstaking, more pliancy, and greater thrift ; and also to the general cultiva- 
tion, the knowledge of modern languages, and of economic geography usually pos- 
sessed by continental manufacturers. 
  NEW DEPARTURES AT HOME. 
But great as has been the progress of foreign countries and keen as is their rivalry 
with us inmany important branches, we have no hesitation in stating our conviction, 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. CCLXIX 
which we believe tobe shared by continental manufacturers themselves, that, taking 
the state of the arts of construction and the staple manufactures as a whole, our peo 
pie still maintain their position at the head of the industrial world, Not only has 
nearly every important machine and process employed in manufactures been either 
invented or perfected in this country in the past, but it is not too much to say that 
most of the prominent new industrial departures of modern times are due to the in- 
ventive power and practical skill of our countrymen. Among these are the great in- 
vention of Bessemer for the production of steel in enormous quantities, by which alone, 
or with its modification by Thomas and Gilchrist, enabling the commonest descrip- 
tion of iron to be used for the purpose, steel is now obtained at one-tenth of the price 
of twenty years ago; the Weldon, Hargreaves, and Deacon processes, which have 
revolutionized the alkali trade; the manufacture of aniline colors by Perkin; the new 
processes in the production of silk fabrics by Lister; the numerous applications of 
water pressure to industrial purposes by Armstrong; the Nasmyth steam hammer; 
the compound steam engine as a source of great economy of fuel; and the practical 
application of electricity to land and submarine telegraphy by Cooke, Wheatstone, 
Thomson, and others. 
Machinery made in this country is more extensively exported than at any former 
period. The best machines constructed abroad are, in the main, and with the excep- 
tions which we have named, made, with slight, if any, modifications, after English 
models. A large proportion of the power looms exhibited and used in the continental 
weaving schools has been imported from this country. In the manufacture of iron 
and steel we stand preéminent, and we are practically the naval architects of the 
world, Our technical journals, such as those of the Institutes of Civil and Mechanical 
Engineers and of the Iron and Steel Institute, are industriously searched and their con- 
tents assimilated abroad. 
Tn those textile manufactures in which other nations have hitherto excelled us, as 
in soft, all-wool goods, we are gaining ground. We saw at Bradford merinos manu- 
factured and finished in this country which would bear comparison in texture and in 
color with the best of those of the French looms and dye houses, and in the delicate 
fabrics of Nottingham and Macclesfield (thanks, in great measure, to their local schools 
of art) we no longer rely on France for designs. 
In art manufactures proper, notably in porcelain, earthenware, and glass, as also in 
decorative furniture, our productions are of conspicuous excellence. It is possible 
that this may be due ina certain degree to the employment, in some branches, of 
skilled workers trained in foreign countries, and we cannot do otherwise than ac- 
knowledge the preéminence, in the main, of our French neighbors in design as applied 
to decorative work or disregard the efforts which they are making to maintain that 
preéminence, and those made in Belgium and Italy to emulate them. 
ORIGIN OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM, 
The beginnings of the modern industrial system are due, in the main, as we have in- 
dicated, to Great Britain. Before factories founded on the inventions of Watt, of 
Arkwright, and Crompton had time to take root abroad, and while our own commerce 
and manufactures increased from year to year, the great wars of the early part of this 
century absorbed the energies and dissipated the capital of continental Europe. 
For many years after the peace we retained almost exclusive possession of the im- 
proved machinery employed in the cotton, woollen, and linen manufactures. By va- 
rious acts of the last century, which were not repealed till 1825, it was made penal 
to enlist English artisans for employment abroad ; the export of spinning machinery 
to foreign countries was prohibited until the early years of Your Majesty’s reign. 
Thus, when less than half a century ago continental countries began to construct 
railways and to erect modern mills and mechanical workshops, they found themselves 
face to face with a full grown industrial organization in this country, which was 
almost a sealed book to those who could not obtain access to our factories. 
FOREIGN TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
To meet this state of things abroad, foreign countries established technical schools 
like the Ecole Centrale of Paris and the polytechnic schools of Germany and Swit- 
zerland and sent engineers and men of science to England to prepare themselves for 
becoming teachers of technology in those schools. 
Technical high schools now exist in nearly every continental state and are the 
recognized channel for the instruction of those who are intended to become the tech- 
nical directors of industrial establishments. Many of the technical chemists have, 
however, been and are being trained in the German universities. Your commissioners 
believe that the success which has attended the foundation of extensive manufact- 
uring establishments, engineering shops, and other works on the continent could not 
have been achieved to its full extent in the face of many retarding influences, had it

CCLXX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
not been for the system of high technical instruction in these schools, for the facil- 
ities for carrying on original scientific investigation, and for the general apprecia- 
tion of the value of that instruction and of original research which is felt in those 
countries. 
With the exception of the Ecole Centrale of Paris, all these schools have been created 
and are maintained almost entirely at the expense of the several states, the fees of 
the students being so low as to constitute only a very small proportion of the total 
income. The buildings are palatial, the laboratories and museums are costly and 
extensive, and the staff of professors, who are well paid according to the continental 
standard, isso numerous as to admit of the utmost subdivision of the subjects taught. 
In Germany, as we have stated in a previous part of our report, the attendance at some 
of the polytechnic schools has lately fallen off, chiefly because the supply of techni- 
cally trained persons is in excess of the present demand; certainly not because it is 
held that the training of the school can be dispensed with. The numerous young 
Germans and Swiss who are glad to find employment in our own manufactories have 
te without exception been educated in one or other of the continental polytechnic 
schools. 
Your commissioners cannot repeat too often that they have been impressed with 
the general intelligence and technical knowledge of the masters and managers of in- 
dustrial establishments on the continent. They have found that these persons as a 
rule possess a sound knowledge of the sciences upon which their industry depends. 
They are familiar with every new scientific discovery of importance and appreciate 
its applicability to their special industry. They adopt not only the inventions and im- 
provements made in their own country, but also those of the world at large, thanks 
to their knowledge of foreign languages and of the conditions of manufacture prev- 
alent elsewhere. 
The creation abroad of technical schools for boys intending to become foremen is of 
much more recent date than that of the polytechnic schools. To this statement 
the foundation during the First Empire of the three French Ecoles des Arts et 
Métiers, at Chalons, Aix, and Angers, is only an apparent excepticnu, because they 
simply vegetated until their reorganization -within the last twenty-five or thirty 
years. Mining schools were, however, established in Prussia in the last century and 
in France about 1817. Among the examples of schools for foremen are those of Win- 
terthur in Switzerland, Chemnitz in Saxony, and Komotan in the Austrian dominions, 
principally for engineers, and the Ecole des Mines at St. Etienne, the latter more 
especially for mining and metallurgy. The theoretical instruction in these schools is 
similar in character but inferior in degree to that of the great polytechnic schools. 
On the other hand considerable attention is devoted in these schools to practical in- 
struction in laboratories and workshops, which is not the case in the polytechnic 
schools. In Prussia, as will be seen from the ministerial report found in the appendix, 
a beginning has been made in the establishment of such secondary technical schools, 
but, in the words of the report, ‘its execution will be tedious and costly.” In Bavaria 
the Industrie-Schulen, which are technical schools of a grade inferior to the poly- 
technic school, give both theoretical and practical instruction, the latter in some 
cases highly specialized, in preparation either for direct entrance on an industrial 
career or for further study in the polytechnic school. In France technical schools of 
a somewhat lower type are being established all over the country. The one at Rheims, 
reviously described, is an excellent example of these schools. The boys from the 
heims school either enter the Ecole des Arts et Métiers at Chalons or go into man- 
ufactories or into business, in each case with a fair knowledge of theory and manipu- 
lation, as mechanics or as chemists. 
It is important to bear in mind that the French schools of the type of that at Rheims, 
though virtually advanced schools, now rank as superior elementary schools, to which 
the pupils are consequently entitled to claim admission without the payment of any 
fees. 
Up to the present time, however, although a few foremen have received some theo- 
retical instruction in schools of this kind, foreign foremen have not generally been 
technically instructed, but, as in England, are men who, by dint of steadiness, intel- 
ligence, and aptitude for command and organization, have raised themselves from 
the eeeon of ordinary workmen. 
The continental weaving schools may, on the whole, so far as their influence on 
trade is concerned, be ranked in the first and second categories; that is to say, they 
are attended by those who propose to become merchants, manufacturers, managers, 
or foremen. They are held in the highest estimation by some of the most intelligent 
and successful continental manufacturers; of this there can be no better proof than 
the erection, in substitution for the one already existing, of the splendid new weay- 
ing schools at Crefeld, probably the most ilourishing centre of the general silk trade, 
at the joint expense of the state, the locality, and the commercial body. Weaving 
schools for workmen, like the evening and Sunday school of Chemnitz, which must 
not be confounded with the superior weaving school of that town, are poorly attended,
-P-A-G-E-271

and can have had no sensible influ ence on the progress of textile manufactures. But 
there are in many places lectures on weaving and pattern designing largely attended 
by workmen. 
The French and German schoo's for miners, and the one which has been quite recently 
founded in Westphalia for workers in iron and steel, differ from the preceding schools 
for foremen, inasmuch as they’ are reserved for the theoretical instruction of men who, 
having already worked practically at their trades, have distinguished themselves by 
superior intelligence and good conduct. Most of the German schools of this kind are 
founded or maintained by “che manufacturers, and will, we feel confident, repay the 
trades which have had ‘he foresight and public spirit to create them, by training 
young men to become fo:-emen and Teading hands, willing and able to carry out with 
intelligence the instruc’,ions of their superior officers.    
SOCIETIES AS TEACHING BODIES. 
For the technical education of workmen, outside of the workshop, the resources of 
continental countries have hitherto been and are still very much more limited than 
has been suppose: in this country to be the case. In several of the more important 
industrial centres of the continent there exist societies such as the Sociétés indus- trielles of Mulhouse, Rheims, Amiens, &c.; the Société @enseignement professionnel 
du Rhéne, which has its headquarters at Lyons and the Niederdsterreichischer 
Gewerbe-Ver‘jin of Austria, one of the chief objects of which is the development of 
technical edrication among workmen and other persons engaged in industry, by means of lectures and by the establishment of schools and museums of technology. These 
associations are supported mainly by the merchants and manufa. vers of the district 
to which ‘heir operations are restricted. In many cases they axe founded and sup- 
ported oy: are greatly assisted by chambers of commerce. These bodies abroad being 
incorporated, and having in France considerable taxing powers over their members, 
are generally wealthier and more influential than those in our own country. In addi- 
tion to these sources of income the associations receive help from the municipality 
and sometimes from the state. In Mulhouse, besides promoting education, the so- 
ciety sees to the material wellbeing of the workmen by erecting on a large scale 
labovers’ dwellings (la cité ouvritre) and by organizing savings banks and other eco- 
nooii¢e arrangements, undertaking in this respect on a smaller scale what is done in 
this country by self sustaining associations ike building and codperative societies 
o£ the workpeople themselves. The society in Lyons has established numerous even- 
ing classes for elementary and technical instruction,which are attended chiefly by 
workpeople; and the South Austrian Trade Society, which has its central office in 
Vienna, has organized several technical day and evening schools for operatives of 
every grade, which are now under state control-and receive subyentions from the 
government. But although these societies, under different names and with varied 
objects, are very numerous, their sphere of action is limited, and the facilities Hey 
offer for evening instruction in science and technology are inferior to those whic! 
are at the disposal of our own workmen. No organization like that of the Science 
and Art Department or of the City and Guilds Institute exists in any continental 
country, and the absence of such organizations has been lamented by many compe- 
tent persons with whom we came in contact abroad. 
EDUCATION OF ARTISANS ABROAD. 
In two very important respects, however, the education of a certain proportion of 
persons employed in industry abroad is superior to that of English workmen: first, 
as regards the systematic instruction in drawing given to adult artisans, more espe- 
cially in France, Belgium, and Italy; and, secondly, as to the general diffusion of ele- 
mentary education in Switzerland and Germany. In some parts of these latter 
countries great attention is paid to drawing in the elementary schools. In France, 
too (where elementary education has hitherto by no means been so general as in the 
two former countries), in the case of those workmen who have had the benefit of reg- 
ular elementary school training, more attention has been paid to elementary drawing 
than is the case in this country. There are also in all large towns in France, and to a 
more limited extent in other countries, numerous evening $ conférences” and ‘ cours” 
on almost every subject of interest in art, science, and literature which workmen have 
the opportunity of attending, as they are entirely gratuitous. Among these the 
most remarkable are the lectures given by eminent men at the Conservatoire des Arts 
et Métiers of Paris. Most of these are of the nature of lectures rather than of prac- 
tical instruction. There are, however, in many places excellent and numerously at- 
tended evening and Sunday technical classes, more especially in Belgium and Austria, 
and there can be no doubt’ that the instruction thus given is already exerting a con- 
siderable influence on the capacity and intelligence of the workmen, and that this 
influence will be increasingly felt in the future. 
         
  
-P-A-G-E-272
  
  * CCLXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
In the evening schools of North Germany (Fortbildungsschulen) the studies of the 
ordinary elementary school are continued, the farther instruction being confined 
mainly to book-keeping and rudimentary mathematics, with some notions of natural 
philosophy. In the evening schools of the same class in South Germany the instruc- 
tion given is of a more technical character than in tlie North. 
For instruction in drawing, as applied mainly to decorative work in France, and 
to both constructive and decorative work in Belgium, the opportunities are excellent. 
The crowded schools of drawing, modelling, carving, and painting, maintained at the 
expense of the municipalities of Paris, Lyons, Brussels, snd other cities —absolutely 
gratuitous and open to all comers, well lighted, furnished with the best models, and 
under the care of teachers full of enthusiasm— stimulate those manufactures and 
crafts in which the fine arts play a prominent part to a degree which is without par- 
allel in this country. Instruction in art applied to industry and decoration is now 
pursued with energy in South Germany and in several of the northern Italian towns, 
and the influence of this instruction on the employment of tl:e people is becoming 
very conspicuous in those countries. The government schools of applied art in France, 
under the decree of 1881, of which the Limoges Decorative Arts School is the earliest 
example, and which, like the abovementioned schools, are gratuitous, should be 
mentioned in this connection. * * * 
HOME INDUSTRIES. 
Home and village industries have been in some cases initiated, in others improved 
and extended, in districts where, from the poverty of the population and the scarcity 
of capital, special aids were essential, notably in Baden, Bavaria, and the Tyrol. In 
the schools established and maintained for this purpose, wood carving and inlaying, 
clock making, filagree work, basket making, and other simple trades for which there 
were local material and aptitude, have been taught with considerable success. In 
some cases these industries have been so firmly and permanently established as to 
render unnecessary the further maintenance of the special schools. In the primary 
schools of the Black Forest, straw plaiting is taught to the girls. Discriminating 
regard is paid to the capabilities of each sex. In “ women’s work” schools on the 
Reutlingen model and in the professional schools for girls which have been estab- 
lished in France and the Netherlands, instruction is successfully given qualifying 
girls for many useful occupations, though these are scarcely of the kind usually un- 
derstood under the term of manufactures. 
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES. 
The report of Mr. William Mather to your commissioners on his six months’ tour 
throughout the United States of America and Canada for the purpose of studying the 
schools and factories of that continent deserves the most careful perusal. It will be 
seen that Mr. Mather assigns greater influence on American manufactures tothe gen- 
eral education of the American people derived from their common schools than to their 
technical schools, the importance of which latter, however, in the training of civil 
engineers has been experienced forsome years, though it has only more recently become 
recognized by those who are engaged in mechanical engineering and in metallurgi- 
cal and manufacturing establishments of various kinds. This recognition is, how- 
ever, now becoming universal. A decided preference is being given in the United States 
for the positions of managers and heads of departments to persons who have received 
ascientific training in a technical school, and the plan is followed in these schools 
of combining instruction in ‘‘application” with instruction in pure science. Al- 
though the conditions of American industry differ in many respects from our own, 
there can be no doubt that we may derive great advantage from a careful study of 
what is being done in the way of technical instruction in the United States, as, to- 
gether with the elementary education of Canada, it is so graphically described by 
Mr. Mather. We may add that the accuracy. of his statements and conclusions is 
generally. confirmed by the accounts of technical instruction in America which we 
ave received from other competent judges. 
® NEED OF TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
Not many years have passed since the time when it would still have been a matter 
for argument whether, in order to maintain the high position which this country has 
attained in the industrial arts, it isincumbent upon us to take care that our managers, 
our foremen, and our workmen should, in the degrees compatible with their circum- 
stamces, combine theoretical instruction with their acknowledged practical skill. No 
argument of this kind is needed at the present day. In nearly all the great indus- 
trial centres, in the metropolis, in Glasgow, in Manchester, Liverpool, Oldham, Leeds,
-P-A-G-E-273
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. CCLXXIII 
Bradford, Huddersfield, Keighley, Sheffield, Nottingham, Birmingham, The Potteries, 
and elsewhere, more or less flourishing schools of science and art, of various grades, 
together with numerous art and science classes, exist, and their influence may be 
traced in the productions of the localities in which they are placed. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED BY MANUFACTURERS. 
The schools established by Sir W. Armstrong at Elswick, by the London and North- 
western Railway Company at Crewe, and those of Messrs. Mather and Platt of Sal- 
“ford, in connection with their engineering works, testify to the importance attached 
by employers to the theoretical training of young mechanics. The efforts of Messrs. 
Denny, the eminent shipbuilders of Dumbarton, for encouraging the instruction of 
their apprentices and for rewarding their workmen for meritorious improvements in 
details applicable to their work, are proofs of this appreciation. The evidence of 
Mr. Richardson, of Oldham, and of Mr. Mather, of Salford, isemphatic as to their ex- 
perience of its economical value. 
Without more particularly referring to the valuable work in the past accomplished 
by the numerous mechanics’ institutes spread over the country, many of them of long 
standing, we may point out that they are now largely remodelling their constitutions 
in order to bring up their teaching to the level of modern requirements as regards 
technical instruction. The example of the Manchester Mechanics’ Institute may be 
studied in this connection. 
Moreover, as evidencing the desire of the artisans themselves to obtain facilities for 
instruction both in science and art, we must not omit to mention the classes estab- 
lished and maintained by some of the leading codperative societies. The Equitable 
Pioneers’ Society of Rochdale has led the way in this, as in so many other social 
movements, It is much to be wished that the various trades’ unions would also con- 
sider whether it is not incumbent on them to promote the technical education of 
their members. 
The manufacturers of Nottingham speak with no uncertain voice of the important 
influence of the local school of art on the lace manufacture of that town. Without 
the Lambeth school, the art productions of Messrs. Doulton could scarcely have come 
into existence. The linen manufacturers of Belfast are becoming alive to the neces- 
sity of technical instruction if competition on equal terms with foreign nations in 
the more artistic productions is to be rendered possible. The new generation of en- 
gineérs and manufacturers of Glasgow has been trained in the technical schools of 
that city. The City and Guilds of London Institute owes its existence to the convic- 
tion of the liverymen that technical instruction is a necessary condition of the wel- 
fare of our great industries. - 
TEACHING OF NATURAL SCIENCE. 
Natural science is finding its way surely though slowly into the curriculum of our 
older English universities and of our secondary schools, It is becoming a prominent 
feature in the upper divisions of the elementary board schools in our large towns. 
There are scarcely any important metallurgical works in the kingdom without a 
chemical laboratory in which the raw materials and products are daily subjected to 
careful analysis by trained chemists. The attainments of the young men who have 
been trained in the Royal Naval College at Greenwich recommend them for remuner- 
ative employment by our great shipbuilding firms. 
BEST MODES OF ADVANCING TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
In our relations with public bodies and individualsin this country during the progress 
of our inquiry, the greatest anxiety has been manifested to obtain our advice as to 
the mode in which technical instruction can be best advanced, and we have to ac- 
knowledge the readiness of the Education and Science and Art Departments to receive 
and act upon suggestions in matters of detail from individual members of the commis- 
sion which it would have been pedantic to delay until *the completion of our task. 
Among the suggestions which have thus been made was that of an exhibition of 
the school work of all nations, which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has 
consented to add to the health exhibition of 1834. This exhibition will be an appro- 
priate illustration of the account of foreign schools contained in the previous parts 
of this report. Your commissioners, during their continental visits, received from 
the authorities of technical schools numerous assurances of their cordial support 
and codperation in such a display. 
Thus, there is no necessity to ‘preach to the converted,” and we may confine our- 
selves to such considerations as bear upon the improvement and more general diffu.

CCLKXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
sion of technical education at home in accordance with the conditions and needs of 
our industrial population. 
In dealing with the question of technical instruction in this country we would, at 
the outset, state our opinion that it is not desirable that we should introduce the 
practice of foreign countries info England without considerable modification. As to 
the higher education, namely, that for those intended to become proprietors or mana- 
gers of industrial works, we should not wish that every one of them should continue 
his theoretical studies till the age of twenty-two or twenty-three years in a poly- 
technic school, and so lose the advantage of practical instruction in our workshops 
(which are really the best. technical schools in the world) during the years from 
eighteen or nineteen to twenty-one or twenty-two, when he is best able to profit by it. 
We have, also, in the science classes under the Science and Art Department (to the 
intelligent and able administration of which it is our duty to bear testimony) a sys- 
tem of instruction for the great body of our foremen and workmen, susceptible cer- 
panty of improvement, but which in its main outlines it is not desirable to dis- 
urb. 
Moreover, in considering by whom the cost of the further development of technical 
instruction should be borne, we must not forget that, if it be true that in foreign 
countries almost the entire cost of the highest general and technical instruction is 
borne by the state, on the other hand, the higher elementary and secondary instruc- 
tion in science falls on the localities to a much greater extent than with us; while, 
as to the ordinary elementary schools, the cost in Germany and Switzerland is al- 
most exclusively borne by the localities; and this was also the case in France and 
Belgium until the people of those countries became impatient of the lamentable ab- 
sence of primary instruction on the part of vast numbers of the rural and in some 
instances of the town population, an evil which large state subventions alone could 
cure within any reasonable period of time. With the exception of France, there is 
no European country of the first rank that has an imperial budget for education com- 
parable in amount with our own. In the United Kingdom at least one-half of the 
cost of elementary education is defrayed out of imperial funds, and the instruction 
of artisans in science and art is almost entirely borne by the state. Hence it will be 
necessary to look, in the main, to local resources for any large addition to the funds 
required for the further development of technical instruction in this country. 
In determining what is the best preparation for the industrial career of those who 
may expect to occupy the highest positions, it is necessary to differentiate between 
capitalists, who will take the general as distinguished from the technical direction of 
large establishments, and those at the head of small undertakings, or the persons 
mnore especially charged with the technical details of either. For the education of 
the former, ample time is avaiiable.and they have the choice between several of our 
modernized grammar schools, to be followed by attendance at the various colleges in 
which science teaching is made an essential feature, or the great public schools and 
universities, provided that, in these latter, science and modern languages should 
take a more prominent place. Either of these methods may furnish an appropriate 
education for those persons to whom such general cultivation as will prepare them 
to deal with questions of administration is of greater value than an intimate acquaint- 
ance with technical details, It is different in regard to the smaller manufacturers 
and to the practical managers of works. In their case, sound knowledge of scientific 
principles has to be combined with the practical training of the factory, and there- 
fore the time which can be appropriated to the former, that is, to theoretical instruc- 
tion, will generally be more limited. 
How this combination is to be carried out will vary with the trade and with the 
circumstances of the individual. In those cases in which theoretical knowledge and 
scientific training are ef preéminent importance, as in the case of the manufacturer 
of fine chemicals, or in that of the metallurgical chemist, or the electrical engineer, 
the higher technical education may with advantage be extended to the age of twenty- 
one or twenty-two. In the cases, however, of those who are to be, for example, 
managers of chemical works in which complex machinery is used, or managers of 
rolling mills, or mechanical] engineers, where early and prolonged workshop expe- 
rience is all-important, the theoretical training should be completed at not later than 
nineteen years of age, when the works must be entered and the scientific education 
carried further by private study or by such other means as do not interfere with the 
practical work of their callings. Many colleges of the class to which we have referred 
have already arranged their courses to meet these requirements, and some of them, 
as will appear from our reports of visits, have workshops for the purpose of familiar- 
izing the students with the use of machine and hand tools. 
It is to be regretted that nearly all of these very useful institutions suffer more or 
Jess from the want of adequate funds to enable them to provide for such a staff of 
professors as is necessary for the proper subdivision of the various subjects taught, 
and for the equipment of museums, apparatus, and laboratories of the various kinds 
essential.to the practical instruction of the student. In this respect the provision in  
-P-A-G-E-275
    TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. CCLXXV 
uzis country compares most unfavorably with that in the universities and polytechnic 
schools of the continent, even in spite of recent munificent benefactions like those of the 
late Mr. Charles Beyer of Manchester, the late Sir Josiah Mason of Birmingham, of the 
Baxter family at Dundee, the late Mr. Harris of Preston, the liberal gifts of Mr. 
Crawford to the Queen’s College at Cork, and others. In ene of benefactions, 
we do not overlook the noble endowment of Sir Joseph Whitworth for the encourage- 
ment of engineering by affording to able and promising young men, especially of the 
class of artisans, the means of obtaining theoretical combined with practical train- 
ing, the former in institutions of the kind we have referred to. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS AS A PREPARATION FOR TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
The best preparation for technical study is a good modern secondary school of the 
types of the Manchester Grammar School, the Bedford Modern School, and the Allan 
len’s Institution at Glasgow. Unfortunately, our middle classes are at a great dis- 
advantage, compared with those of the continent, for want of a sufficient number of 
such schools. The transfer of the functions of the endowed schools commissioners 
to the charity commissioners has not had the effect of increasing the rate of progress 
in the reorganization of our secondary schools. We consider it to be essential that 
steps should be taken to insure that this work shall be carried on with greater vigor 
in the future than it has been hitherto. We learn that there are still endowments 
available for education, amounting to upwards of 200,000/. per annum, which have 
not been dealt with by the commissioners. In the schemes for the new schools the 
subjects of science and modern languages should form a very prominent part ; and it 
would be desirable in some of these schools, especially in large towns (where classical 
schools are not wanting), in order to provide for the fuller teaching of these subjects, 
more particularly of mathematics, that the classical languages should be altogether 
excluded from the schemes of instruction. But the existing endowments are very 
unevenly distributed over the country; in many of the large manufacturing centres 
no resources of the kind exist; private enterprise is clearly inadequate to do all that 
is required in establishing such schools, and we must look to some public measure to 
supply this, the greatest defect of our educational system. It is to be desired that, 
in the proposed. reorganization of local government, power should be given to im- 
portant local bodies, like the proposed county boards and the municipal corporations, 
to originate and support secondary and technical schools in conformity with the public 
opinion for the time being of their constituents. 
Intelligent youths of the artisan classes should have easy access to secondary and 
jostininel uabbota by numerous scholarships, and the more promising students of them 
again to the higher technical colleges. 
SCIENCE TEACHING IN THE ELEMENTARY SCiH100L. 
For the great mass of our working population, who must necessarily begin to earn 
their livelihood at an early age and from whom our foremen will be mostly selected, 
it is essential that instruction in the rudiments of the sciences bearing upon industry 
should form a part of the curriculum of the elementary schools, and that instruction 
in drawing, Ane more especially in drawing with rule and compass, of a character likely 
to be useful to them in their future occupations as workmen and artisans, should receive 
far greater attention than it does at present. The importance of the first of these sub- 
jects has so far been acknowledged by the education department that in all infant 
schools simple lessons on objects and the more commonly occurring phenomena of 
nature have been made obligatory. This system of instruction, if properly illustrated 
by the exhibition of the object itself, or of diagrams or models of the same, or by the 
simplest kinds of experiments, is an excellent foundation for the subsequent teaching 
of elementary science. 
When, however, the child enters the elementary school the teaching of science prac- 
tically ceases until it reaches the upper division, inasmuch as the arrangement of the 
class subjects in the lower division is found in practice to exclude science from that 
division; only two subjects being allowed, of which “English” must be one and 
“ geography” may be another, this latter being generally preferred to the alternative 
subject of “elementary science.” It appears to us that geography, if properly taught, 
isa branch of elementary science which need not be separated from science generally, 
and can well be taught along with the other branches of science by means of the 
object lessons which are described in the code. Thus there would be only two class 
subjects instead of three, and in this way the connecting link which is now wanting 
between science as taught in the infant school and in the higher division of the ele- 
mentary school would be supplied

insures the sound character of the instruction, while the repetition of the lesson by 
the schoolmaster enables him to improve himself in the methods of science teaching. 
This should, however, be supplemented by the establishment of higher elementary 
schools, like those of Sheffield and Manchester, into which the more advanced pupils 
of the primary schools may be drafted, especially if the parents of those children 
should be able to keep them at school up to the age of fourteen or fifteen unassisted, 
or, if they are unable to do so, assisted by schoJarships taking the place of the wages 
which they would otherwise earn. In these latter schools it is possible to provide 
efficient laboratories in which practical work is performed by the pupils, while this 
cannot adequately be done for the ordinary primary schools. Youths having the ad- 
vantage of such instruction will be well prepared to avail themselves at alater period 
of the classes of the Science and Art Department and of the technical classes under the 
auspices of the City and Guilds Institute, which are now so numerous, and many of 
which are under excellent teachers. 
The evidence given before us leaves no doubt that the directors of both these institu- 
tions use every effort in their power to secure sound and practical teaching in these 
classes, so faras thatcan be effected by assistance in training the teachers and by careful 
testing, in their examinations, of the results of the instruction given. In regard to 
the first, much is to be hoped for from the increasing number of teachers who are now 
able to take advantage of the high scientific instruction given in the Normal School of 
Science at South Kensington, as well as from the pCRELALy: assistance offered by the 
Science and Art Department to science teachers desirous of attending the courses and 
laboratories of various provincial colleges, while for teachers of technology a great 
step in advance will be made when the Central Institution of the City Guilds is in 
operation. As to the latter—that is to say, the thoroughness of the instruction given 
in the classes—more close and frequent inspection than at present is much to be de- 
sired, a higher payment for the more advanced grades of several subjects should be 
made than is now the case, and practical laboratory work in the higher grades in 
science should be more generally demanded. 
An important point to which the attention of the inspectors should be more partic- 
ularly directed is to ascertain that proper apparatus and appliances are provided 
for practical work in these classes, 
ART SCHOOLS FOR ARTISANS. 
. With reference to the subject of drawing, we cannot too often call attention to the 
extraordinary efforts which are being made abroad for instruction in art, more espe- 
cially as applied to industrial and decorative purposes, and to the important influence 
of this instruction in furnishing employment for artisans on the continent. Without 
depreciating what has been done in this direction by the schools and classes under the 
auspices of the Science and Art Department in this country, and while fully alive to 
the importance of the organization which tends to the diffusion of art instruction 
over a wide area, your commissioners cannot conceal from themselves the fact that 
their influence on industrial art in this country is far from being so great as that of 
similar schools abroad. Thisis due, no doubt, to some extent to the want of proper 
and sufficient preparation on the part of the students, owing to the inadequate in- 
struction they have received in drawing in the elementary schools. 
DRAWING AND MODELLING. 
Your commissioners are aware that the numberof children who are supposed to 
learn drawing in elementary schools is considerable, but it is small compared with 
the total number in attendance, and it is, we have reason to believe, diminishing. 
We have ascertained by inspection that the instruction is in far too many cases of 
little value. Instead of a mass of inferior drawings being sent up once a year to 
South Kensington for examination there, it is necessary that the instruction in draw- 
ing in elementary schools should be as carefully supervised on the spot by the White- 
hall inspectors as is that in other branches of primary education. In nearly all 
the places abroad which your commissioners have visited they have found that 
drawing is an obligatory subject of instruction in the primary school and that it 
is regarded as of equal importance with writing. The number of hours which:the 
children devote to lessons in drawing abroad is frequently as many as three per 
week, whereas in England the subject is not only not obligatory, but in about three- 
fourths of our elementary schools no instruction whatever is given in this subject, 
and in those schools in which drawing is taught the time devoted to it rarely exceeds 
one hour per week, and even that not always regularly. This want of attention, to- 
gether with the absence of competent teachers, proper models and methods, and ade- 
quate inspection, fully accounts for the inferiority to which we have referred. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE, CCLXXVII 
training of teachers for the Irish national schools includes special instruction in draw- 
ing, and a grant for drawing is made to primary schools in Ireland by the commis- 
sioners of national education. The drawing in some of the schools of the Christian 
Brothers and in some of those under the board of intermediate education is good. 
Your commissioners are of opinion that sound instruction in the rudiments of draw- 
ing should _ be incorporated with writing in all primary schools, both for girls and 
boys, by which, also, according to the experience of competent authorities, the writ- 
ing would be much improved. Something in this direction has already been done in 
many good infant schools, where children of the age of six draw triangles, squares, 
oblongs, &c., on their slates. This exercise is repeated on the day of inspection, and 
is taken into account in estimating the value attached to ‘‘appropriate occupations.” 
We have observed with satisfaction the recent circular (Art Form, No. 1194) of 
August, 1883, prescribing the new exercise of drawing to scale. We believe the prin- 
ciple therein laid down to be excellent, and we trust that the school managers and 
teachers will avail themselves of the advantages offered to them in this alteration in 
the first grade work. The permission recently accorded to teachers to give instruc- 
tion in drawing and modelling to the children of the elementary schools out of the 
ordinary school hours is also likely to prove very advantageous. 
We are of opinion that more attention than has hitherto been devoted to it should 
be directed to the subject of modelling in the elementary school. We notice that by 
arecent addition to the art directory small classes in modelling may now claim a 
local examination; we believe this to be a most salutary regulation. Modelling is 
an exercise of great importance to the future workman, and its rudiments can well 
be taken up, as in continental schools, at the earliest age. 
Assuming such preparation in the infant and elementary school as we have here 
suggested, the progress of subsequent instruction in art classes would be immeasur- 
ably more rapid. Whether the attendance in any given locality will ever be so great 
in this country, where the instruction has to be paid for, as in France, Belgium, and 
elsewhere, where it is gratuitous, is a matter for grave doubt. However this may be, 
there are two points in connection with the instruction in art schools and classes as 
bearing on industrial pursuits which require careful attention. The first is 'one 
which we are glad to perceive is now fully appreciated by the Science and Art Depart- 
ment, viz, the advantage of substituting practice in rapid but correct execution in 
place of the method of stippling, which was formerly not sufficiently discouraged in 
art schools and classes ; greater attention also than hitherto should be given to mod- 
elling. The second point relates to industrial designing. This, for a variety of 
reasons, the chief of which are the want of sufficient knowledge of manufactures 
on the part of art teachers and the absence of sympathy evinced by the proprietors 
of industrial works, has, with some notable exceptions, not received sufficient at- 
tention in our art schools and classes. In fact, there has been a great departure in 
this respect from the intention with which the ‘‘schools of design” were originally 
founded, viz, ‘‘ the practical application of (a knowledge of) ornamental art to the 
improvement of manufactures.” Large grants of public money for teaching art to 
artisans in such classes can scarcely be justified on any other ground than its indus- 
trial utility. 
APPLIED ART WORK. 
On the subject of the teaching of industrial design, we are of opinion that the 
Science and Art Department may with advantage depart from their principle, as at 
first laid down, of granting encouragement to design only, so far. as to award grants 
for specimens of applied art workmanship in the materials themselves, as a test of 
the applicability of the design and as a reward for success in overcoming the tech- 
nical difficulties of the manufacture. 
It seems scarcely fair that well executed art work by a student, say a richly chased 
piece of silver plate, should obtain only the same recompense as the design for the 
same object on paper. We are aware that special vigilance would in this case be 
required in order to prevent the use of such rewards for trade or for other than edu- 
cational purposes. 
It appears from the evidence, with which we include a remarkable letter from M. 
Willms, the eminent designer of Birmingham, that it would be well if persons prac- 
tically acquainted with the application of design to industrial manufactures were 
more extensively consulted in the award of prizes for industrial design. We are 
aware that this is now done in some measure, but, however eminent may be the gen- 
tlemen whom the department has been in the habit of consulting, it is unlikely that 
the small number of these should be sufficiently familiar with the vast varieties of 
applications to have the special knowledge requisite for judges in the large number 
of trades in which design forms an important element. 
INDUSTRIAL ART MUSEUMS, 
Among the most important means of stimulating industrial art education and of 
spreading a knowledge and appreciation of art throughout the country is the foun-  
-P-A-G-E-278
  CCLXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
dation of local museums of applied art of such a character as is best adapted to ad- 
vance the industries of the districts in which they are situated. 
Stimulated by the advice and influence of the direetor of the South Kensington 
Museum, and with the liberal aid of private benefactors, such collections have been 
provided in the local art museums at Sheffield, Derby, York, and elsewhere. In Man- 
chester also, steps have been taken to found an industrial museum, and the corpora- 
tion has acquired the famous Bock collection of textile fabrics for this purpose. The 
Manehester, Birmingham, Stoke, and other galleries are open on Sundays, and are 
visited by increasing numbers of orderly working people. It is very desirable that 
similar facilities should be provided for the inspection of our metropolitan museums 
and collections. We are of opinion that the connection between these museums and 
the local schools of art should be of an intimate character. Indeed, in this respect 
much may be learned from foreign countries, where many such museums exist and 
exert great influence on manufactures. Further, we must express strong approval, 
in which we merely repeat the opinion offered by competent witnesses both at home 
and abroad, of the system of circulating among the local museums collections of works 
of art from the national collection at South ‘Kensington. The value and utility of 
these collections are greatly enhanced by suitable manuals and guide books well illus- 
trated and sold at a cheap rate; these serve to explain to visitors of the artisan 
classes the features most worthy of notice. i 
While we fully admit the force of the contention that the contributions of the 
state to the foundation and maintenance of museums will be of the greatest service 
to the country at large, if applied mainly to central institutions like those of the 
metropolis, of Edinburgh, and of Dublin, we highly approve of the grants to provin- 
cial museums of reproductions, either gratuitously or at a very low price. Those 
ae may even, in the case of typical museums situated in some of the chief indus- 
rial centres, be extended with advantage to original examples of art and of manu- 
factures calculated to increase the knowledge and improve the taste of those (more 
especially of the artisans) engaged therein. 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING GRANTS. 
Your commissioners believe that the grants now made in aid of the buildings for 
Jocal schools of science and art and for industrial museums in connection with them, 
limited as they are to a maximum of 5001. for art schools and the same sum for seience 
schools, coupled also with the requirements that they shall be given only for build- 
ings under the free libraries act or in connection with schools of art require revision, 
and tend rather to discourage local effort than otherwise, inasmuch as they give an 
erroneous impression of what is really required in order that suitable buildings may 
be provided. 
Yourcommissioners highly approve of the recent foundation ofscholarships to promis- 
ing students in the science classes of the Science and Art Department, enabling them to 
continue their education at various higher schools. The limitation of the available 
funds appears to have rendered necessary in consequence of this step the abolition of 
the Queen’s prizes, given for success in the elementary stages, and the substitution of 
honorary certificates in place of them. We find there is an opinion prevalent that 
these certificates will not afford sufficient stimulus to certain students. It is to be 
hoped, however, that a small addition to the customary local prize funds will be readily 
subscribed to supply this deficiency. 
But all these institutions and measures will not alone accomplish the object aimed 
at. For this the localities must rely far more than has been the case hitherto on their 
own exertions. Teachers should know that they labor under the eye of those who are 
interested in the work being thoroughly and conscientiously done. The organization 
and efficiency of the science schools at Oldham and Keighley are conspicuous exainples 
of what may be done in regard to the scientific and technical instruction of artisans, 
where local employers take an active and intelligent interest in the work. The Old- 
ham School of Science and Art may, so far as science teaching is concerned, be re- 
garded as the type and example of what evening schools should be; and the existence 
of similar efficient and flourishing schools in all our industrial towns would greatly 
contribute to confirm our industrial position. The remuneration of teachers should 
not depend to so great an extent as at present on the grants from headquarters. 
School boards should be authorized to establish and conduct science and art classes 
for artisans, and where no school boards exist power should be given to the local 
governing bodies to establish or support such schools. If the teaching is not entirely 
gratuitous (and the regularity of attendance in the art classes in the French and Bel- 
gian cities and in the science classes in Liége, Seraing, and elsewhere shows that it 
is a prejudice to suppose that people only appreciate what they pay for), the fees 
ought to be on the lowest possible scale.  
-P-A-G-E-279
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. COLXXIX 
TEACHING AND APPLIANCES. 
Your commissioners have had before them deputations of representative working- 
men who have expressed their views on the wants of the working classes with re- 
spect to the teaching of science and art, and who have stated that the assistance 
afforded by the department is not sufficiently directed towards the requirements of 
their several trades. We believe that many workmen are disposed to attach too little 
value to the importance of acquiring a knowledge of the principlesof science because 
they do not see their application. Weare ofthe opinion that whenever it is possible 
persons engaged in the trade taught and having scientifie knowledge should give in- 
struction to workmen, and we have ascertained that a large number of such teachers 
are registered under the examination scheme of the City and Guilds of London Insti- 
tute. We visited classes of this character at the Polytechnic Institution in Regent 
street, at the Manchester Technical School, the Lyceum at Oldham, and at other places, 
some of which were excellent. 
The city guilds are trying a most important experiment in their practical classes. 
If empiricism be avoided, a great point will be gained by the attraction to working 
men and women of a mode of instruction in which the direct application of scientific 
principles is the means by which a knowledge of those principles is conveyed to their 
minds. As to this point, we refer to the almost unanimous expression of opinion 
coittained in the letters of eminent manufacturers in reply to our circular asking 
their advice as to the best means of promoting technical instruction. 
We cannot dismiss this branch of the subject without calling attention to the edu- 
eational value of the museums of natural objects now found in many of the modern 
elementary schools of the continent, Probably the best examples of such collections 
are those of the Normal School of Brusseis and of the elementary schools of Ziirich. 
Collections of natural objects, pictures, and diagrams are of the greatest assistance 
for illustrating object lessons in rudimentary science to children of the earliest 
ears. 
_ Many persons who have paid attention to the working of free libraries in our large 
towns are of opinion that the benefit of these might be extended to elementary 
schools by placing at the disposal of such schools books of a character calculated to 
interest children of school age. Among these books some suitable technical works, 
especially illustrated ones, might be included, These school libraries would be of the 
nature of the branch libraries which are now attached to many of the free libraries 
of our large towns. 
Your commissioners, after having had the opportunity of further considering the 
value of manual work asa part of primary instruction and after having seen such 
work introduced into elementary schools of various grades in other countries besides 
France, are able now to express @ stronger opinion in its faver than at the time of 
their first report. They do this with greater confidence because, in consequence 
partly of the suggestion contained in that report, the experiment of introducing 
manual work into primary schools has been successfully effected by at least two 
school boards in this country, viz, those of Manchester and Sheflield.    
MANUAL WORK. 
Your commissioners have had the opportunity of inspecting the manual work of the 
pupils, both at the Manchester board schools and at the central school in Sheffield, 
and they are satisfied that such work is v beneficial as a part-of the preliminary 
education of boys in this country who are to be subsequently engaged in industrial 
pursuits, even though it should not, as however it probably will do, actually shorten 
the period of their apprenticeship. 
Your commissioners see no reason why, since grants are made on needlework in 
girls’ schools, they should not be made on manual work in boys’ schools. This in- 
struction may be given so as not to interfere with the ordinary work of the school. 
Tt has been proved that this can be done, the boys being most eager to return for 
handicraft teaching after school hours. 
Whenever more attention shall be given to drawing, and especially to mechanieal 
and geometrical drawing, in the ordinary and the higher elementary schools, it will 
be proper and desirable that the work executed in the shops attached to these schools 
should be made from drawings prepared by the children themselves.    
         
  
ATTENDANCE AT ELE 
  NTARY SCHOOLS, 
We need scarcely say that the success, not only of technical, but of the ordinary 
elementary instruction of our working population depends upon the regular attend- 
ance of the children at school and upon their remaining there sufficiently long to 
insure that the knowledge acquired shail leave some lasting impression on their 
minds. As will have appeared from other parts of this report, the children of the
-P-A-G-E-280
  CCLXXxX REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
workpeople of Germany and Switzerland, with few exceptions, remain at school till 
the age of fourteen years, and in some of the German States are required to continue 
their elementary instruction two years longer in evening and Sunday schools, if their 
examination at fourteen has not been satisfactory. The wages of the parents in these 
countries are generally lower and the sacrifice of their children’s earnings is conse- 
quently felt more than with us. The efficiency of the American workmen is mainly 
attributed, by all who have inquired into the subject, to the primary education ac- 
quired by them during a prolonged attendance at school. In our own country great 
diversity prevails as to the standard authorizing the employment of children as full- 
timers. In Scotland this will be remedied by the act of last session. After next year 
no child under the age of fourteen years can be employed on full time in Scotland, un- 
less it has passed the fifth standard. We.have no doubt that all classes interested in 
industry will quickly reap the benefit of this amendment of the law, and we see no 
reason why this regulation should not be extended to England and Wales, so far as 
it applies to factories and workshops.      
COLLEGES AND THEIR TEACHING, 
We have avoided in the foregoing statement making special observations on the 
merits or defects of the various scientific and technical colleges and schools which 
are at work or in course of establishment in this country, but we think it due to those 
who have founded and those who are conducting these excellent institutions to state 
that all of them, in each of the three divisions of the United Kingdom, are, in spite 
of limited means, producing good results. It is most praiseworthy on the part of the 
professors and teachers that they devote themselves to the important work of tuition 
for salaries so small as those which they as a rule receive, when many would, by em- 
ploying their scientific and technical knowledge in private enterprise, obtain much 
arger pecuniary remuneration. We may remark concerning the colleges that it is 
not necessary that all of them should be of the highest type. To enable the rela- 
tively small number of persons capable of occupying the highest industrial positions 
to acquire the most complete education of which modern science admits, only a few 
well-equipped institutions of high rank are needed. It is, however, of national im- 
portance that these few should be placed in such a position of efficiency as to enable 
them to carry out successfully the highest educational work in the special direction 
for which circumstances, particularly of locality, have fitted them. Your commis- 
sioners believe that no portion of the national expenditure on education is of greater 
importance than that employed in the scientific culture of the leaders of industry. 
Your commissioners fear that the belief in the efficacy of training of this highest 
character is, in England, at present small among those whom it will ultimately 
benefit; and yet there are few countries in which so many investigations have 
been made the practical bearings of which were not at the outset apparent but 
which have in the end led to the most important practical results. The discovery by 
Faraday of magneto-electricity and by Joule of the mechanical equivalent of heat 
at once occur as examples. The Englishman is accustomed to seek for an immediate 
return, and has yet to learn that an extended and systematic education up to and 
including the methods of original research is now a necessary preliminary to the 
fullest development of industry. It is, among other elements of progress, to the 
gradual but sure growth of public opinion in this direction that your commissioners 
Jook for the means of securing to this country in the future, asin the past, the high- 
est position as an industrial nation. 
We desire to express our satisfaction at the recent establishment of weaving and 
dyeing schools in the north of England, and of mechanical laboratories in several 
localities. The utility of weaving schools to proprietors and managers of factories, 
and to merchants who desire to become acquainted with the processes of the manu- 
facture of the goods in which they deal, has been so clearly demonstrated on the 
continent that we need adduce no further arguments in their favor. The weaving 
and dyeing schools of Leeds have been established and are maintained entirely by 
the Clothworkers’ Company of London. We regard this as one of the most useful 
and appropriate purposes to which a portion of their funds could have been devoted. 
The mechanical laboratoriesand mechanical drawing schools at Nottingham, Shef- 
field, Hudderstield, and elsewhere will be of the greatest service in enlarging the 
knowledge and experience ef young artisans who are kept continuously at one branch 
in their daily work. 
The teaching of art and science subjects in the training colleges of Great Britain 
for elementary school teachers is very defective. The inspection on the part of the 
Science and Art Department has until lately been greatly neglected, owing to the 
divided responsibility for the colleges of the Education Department and the Kensington 
authorities. The answers received by the examiners to such questions as the follow- 
ing: ‘Write out the heads of a lecture to an elementary class on the chemical and 
physical properties of water, mentioning the experiments which you would show and
-P-A-G-E-281
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. CCLXXXI 
your object in showing them,” prove conclusively that the students have no idea as 
to how such a simple matter ought to be brought before a class. It would greatly 
conduce to sound and efficient training in science, and particularly in the methods 
of teaching, if those students in training who have shown an aptitude for science 
work could be sent annually to the Normal School of Science at South Kensington or 
to other approved ‘ient institutions. The provision for art teaching in most of the 
training colleges is inferior even to that at present made for science, and an entire 
reform in this respect is urgently needed; and similar measures should be taken for 
systematic instruction in art asin science, Considerable attention is, as we have said 
elsewhere, paid to drawing in the Normal School in Dublin, where it is tanght by a 
competent art master. 
The school boards of our great cities are fully alive to the defective character of 
the instruction of pupil teachers. In London, Liverpool, and elsewhere they have 
endeavored to apply a partial remedy by introducing joint instruction, under special 
teachers qualified in each subject, instead of having each headmaster to instruct the 
pupil teachers of his own school in every subject. The Education Department has 
also taken a small step in the right direction by somewhat limiting the number of 
hours that the pupils may be employed in teaching, so as to give them a little more 
leisure for learning. No considerable improvement can, however, be expected until 
the great school boards are authorized to establish colleges for training teachers. 
Thése colleges would be day schools and need not receive from the State enormous 
capitation grants like those now given to the English denominational training col- 
leges, ay only small allowances like these granted to the day students in those of 
Scotland.   
CITY AND GUILDS OF LONDON INSTITUTE. 
In concluding this part of our subject, we deem ourselves justified in giving, at the 
risk of repeating some of the statements we may have made in the earlier parts of 
our report, a short review of the work initiated, controlled, and contemplated by the 
City and Guilds of London Institute, inasmuch as this important organization has 
been created in order to promote the technical instruction of persons of every grade 
engaged in industry. 
fhe institute had not been in existence very long when your commissioners were 
appointed, and consequently they have scarcely had the opportunity of estimating 
the value of the work it is doing in some of its branches. Even now that work is 
in many parts of the kingdom unknown, and this is particularly the case in Ireland. 
In Dublin, Cork, and in many other Irish towns athe was known at the time of 
our visit of the encouragement to technical instruction offered by the institute’s 
scheme of technological examinations, whereas in Belfast advantage has been taken of 
it, and the establishment there of a technical school for instruction in the weaving 
and dyeing of linen and in mechanical engineering is largely due to its action. 
Central Lnstitution.— The Central Institution, which is not yet opened, is intended by 
the institute to fulfil functions resembling those of the great polytechnic schools of 
the continent. Your commissioners have examined the proposed scheme of instruc- 
tion embodied in the report of the institute, and they have also inspected the build- 
ing, which is nearly complete. They consider that, as the number of technical classes 
and technical schools increases, as it is likely to do, the want of such an institution as 
that in Exhibition road for the training of teachers will be more and more felt. It 
will be of great advantage as a technical high school for the metropolis, which is in 
fact one of our greatest industrial centres. It is intended to afford additional facili- 
ties for the prosecution of original research in science. Jn order, however, that the 
institution may effect the purpose for which itis intended, itshould be well endowed, 
both for the provision of adequate special instruction and also for the establishment 
of exhibitions to defray the cost of mainteriance of poor students while BUTRIDE 
their studies. Without expressing any positive opinion as to the amount required 
for this purpose, your commissioners fear that the annual sum at present subseribed 
by the livery companies is inadequate to the future requirements of the institution. 
Finsbury Technical College.—As regards the Finsbury Technical College, your com- 
missioners believe that the evening classes connected with it are giving valuable 
technical instruction, such as is greatly needed by the artisans of the district in 
which the school is situated. The practical laboratory instruction in the applications 
of electricity to trade purposes is worthy of special mention. 
The program of the day school is well devised, and the offer of scholarships to the 
principal middle class schools of the metropolis, which enable select pupils there- 
from to continue their education at the Finsbury College, is a good feature in the 
scheme. Considering the want that is generally felt of good trade schools into which 
promising pupils from the upper standards of the public elementary schools may be 
drafted, your commissioners are of opinion that a more intimate connection of the 
day department of the Finsbury Technical College with the elementary schools would 
also be desirable.  
-P-A-G-E-282
  CCLXXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
We think that similar trade schools, in which the curriculum consists mainly of 
practical science teaching, workshop instruction, drawing, and modern languages, 
en with advantage be established in other parts of London. 
jouth London Technical Art School.—Your commissioners examined with great in- 
terest the work of the South London Technical Art School. The teaching of this 
school has had a direct bearing upon the important manufacturing works of Messrs. 
Doulton, and in few cases have we been able more definitely to ascertain the extent 
to which technical instruction has benefited a local industry. In many other branches 
besides that of the manufacture and painting of pottery, the teaching of design in 
eonnection with the material to which it is to be applied would be undoubtedly ad- 
vantageous. In this school practical instruction is also given in wood engraving, and 
a class is about to be formed in enamelling; the City and Guilds of London Institute 
might usefully extend this kind of teaching in other directions. 
‘echnological classes in the country.—By means of the institute’s scheme of techno- 
logical examinations, classes have been formed in all the large manufacturing towns, 
in which the instruction is more specialized, according to the requirements of persons 
engaged in different industries, than has been thought desirable in the state-aided 
classes which are held under the direction of the Science and Art Department. It 
will be seen by the collection of letters from eminent manufacturers, that classes of 
the former kind are greatly valued and regarded as deserving of continued encour- 
agement. 
The regulation of the institute which restricts the payment on results to the ease of 
candidates engaged in the industries to which the examination refers, is a good one; 
and the introduction of practical tests and the importance which the institute attaches 
to preliminary science knowledge and to skill in drawing are to be commended. 
From the rapid increase in the number of candidates for these examinations during 
the last four years (the number in 1879 haying been 202, and in 1883, 2,397), it may be 
assumed that, as they become more generally known, that number will still further 
eee and that much larger funds will be required in payment to teachers on 
results. 
We consider that the institute has rendered efficient service to technical education 
by means of the contributions it has given to the establishment of technical schools in 
the great centres of manufacturing industry, where they are even more necessary 
than in the metropolis. The institute appears to have distributed its grants with 
judgment and discretion, and in many cases, notably in Nottingham, Manchester, 
Sheffield, and Leicester, its contributions have had the effectof stimulating local effort 
in the establishment of new technical classes. 
Your commissioners are able generally to indorse the several schemes of technical 
instruction now in operation or about to be carried on by the City and Guilds of Lon- 
don Institute, and in view of the efficient and permanent working of these schemes 
we should be glad to see the funds of the institute made fully adequate to the effi- 
cient carrying out of the objects it has in view, which, in our opinion, is not yet the 
ease. We think it is of importance that the grants made by the contributing livery 
companies should be placed upon a permanent basis. 
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN IRELAND. 
While the preceding remarks apply to the United Kingdom as a whole, including 
those portions of Ireland, and more especially of the province of Ulster, in which the 
factory system is fully developed, other portions of the latter country require to be 
separately considered. In saying this we refer more particularly to the poor and 
remote districts of the west. 
Dublin.— Before preceeding to this part of the subject, however, we would refer very 
shortly to the question of technical instruction suitable for foremen and workmen in 
Dublin. While science and art classes, many of them very successful, are to be found 
in several of the important towns of Ireland, there are scarcely any science classes at 
work in Dublin, ‘Various reasons were assigned to us for this state of things, some of 
. them of a kind into which it is not expedient that we should enter. At the same time, 
there is in Dublin the Royal College of Science, with a staff of competent professors, 
an admirable technical museum, and laboratories fairly well equipped for practical 
work. It appears from theevidence that, of the small number of students who follow 
a complete course of instruction in this institution, about one-half are Englishmen, 
holders of the royal exhibitions of the Science and Art Department, scarcely any of 
whom become teachers of science in Ireland. There are no short summer courses at 
the college, liké those at the normal school at South Kensington, for the instruction 
of science teachers. There are, we are aware, some courses of evening lectures, 
but, although the laboratories of the college are the only ones in Dublin available for 
practical evening instruction, such instruction in science and in mechanical drawing 
forms no part of the arrangements of the college. It appears that by the rules of the 
Science and Art Department the professors of the college cannot earn grants on the
-P-A-G-E-283

results of instruction in science, as would be the case if they were ordinary science 
teachers. We aré of opinion that so long as the effective work of the college in pre- 
paring associate students, and more particularly Irish students, is so limited in area 
as at present, evening classes with practical laboratory work should form a part of 
the regular college courses, and that the remuneration of the professors should depend 
in part on the success, or at any rate on the regular attendance, of students at such 
classes. 
Irish intermediate schools.—We would also remark that we have received evidence 
of a very contradictory nature as to the teaching of science in the Irish intermediate 
schools, We believe, however, that it is engaging the attention of the board of in- 
termediate education, and we only d¢em it necessary to state in reference to this sub- 
ject that efficient instruction in science will not be possible in those schools unless 
they are provided with proper laboratories, which in most if not in all of them are at 
present entirely wanting. 
But the most important part of our task with regard to Ireland is to consider the 
peer of improving the industrial conditions of the poor and remote districts of 
he west by means of technical education. 
Books used in Irish national schools.— By the courtesy of Sir Patrick Keenan, K. C. M.G., 
the resident commissioner of national education in Ireland, your commissioners have 
been furnished with what they understood to be a complete set of the books used in 
the Irish national schools. They find that these books are well adapted for the liter- 
ary instruction of the children of various ages in those schools, and that they contain 
much interesting information on the natural features and resourcesof Ireland. But, 
except as to agriculture, they do not afford adequate assistance towards graduated 
instruction in industrial processes or in the rudiments of the sciences on which those 
processes are founded. As the Irish national education commissioners are by their 
regulations mainly responsible for the selection of the books used in the schools, this 
defect should receive their early attention. 
Home industries and manual deaterity of Irish people.—There is a general consensus of 
opinion on the part of persons of all ranks in that country, whatever may be their views 
on other subjects, that the prosperity of the poorer districts of Ireland may be greatly 
promoted by technical instruction in handicraft and in home industries. There is a 
conviction not less general, and it is one which our visits have fully confirmed in our 
minds, that the children and young people of Ireland of the laboring class possess 
great manual dexterity and aptitude, which only require to be developed in order to 
be useful to themselves and to those among whom they live. As evidence of this 
we need only to refer to the remarkable success of the Christian Brothers and to that 
of the ladies of religious orders in training children and young persons for handicrafts 
in industrial schools and institutions of a like nature. There appears to be noreason 
why similar instruction to that which is given in these schools should not be given 
elsewhere if the necessary funds and teachers are forthcoming. We have shown 
that instruction of this kind given on the continent to persons in remote districts, 
who would otherwise be idle, has added materially to their resources, both directly 
and by training them for employment in larger industrial concerns, and we have as- 
certained that no great expenditure of public money has been required in order to 
produce these effects. . 
Not only is instruction of this kind deemed to be desirable, but we have found that 
there is a willingness on the part of benevolent persons in Ireland to assist its pro- 
motion by subscriptions and in other ways. It is true that by some it has been pro- 
posed that the government should itself initiate, if it did not entirely charge itself 
with, this work, but we were happy to find there were others who would be quite 
satisfied if its utility received the imprimatur of the government and if the state 
offered rewards for the ascertained results of instruction of this kind. We are of 
opinion that successful work of this nature, whether it be conducted by individuals 
or societies or by religious bodies, deserves the recognition and reward of the gov- 
ernment. We think it no part of our duty to state which are the home industries 
best adapted to the conditions of different parts of Ireland. Each locality will be 
able to form its own judgment in regard to this, and due weight should be given by 
the government to such local expression of opinion, payment in all cases being de- 
pendent upon the results obtained in the schools or classes. Wedo not think it would 
be possible for the government to train teachers for a variety of home industries, but 
it might contribute to the payment of such teachers appointed by the localities, and 
it would be expedient to establish a class of itinerant teachers for service in districts 
where resident instructors cannot be maintained. 
These suggestions apply even in a greater degree to the instruction of girls than of 
boys. 
Ss ca in the use of tools in Irish primary schools.—We need scarcely point out 
that, if it be deemed desirable to introduce manual instruction in the use of tools in 
elementary schools at all, this would apply in an eminent degree to the primary 
schools of Ireland. It was stated in evidence before us that in some partsof Ireland
-P-A-G-E-284
CCLXXXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ordinary handicrafts, like those of the mason, have become absolutely extinct. 
Whether the children remain in their own immediate localities or migrate to other 
parts of the country or emigrate to our colonies or to foreign countries, such instruc- 
tion leading up to their apprenticeship as skilled laborers, instead of their fulfilling, 
as is now too much the case, the part of mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, 
would be of the greatest value to them. We are happy to find that the authorities 
of the national board of education in Ireland appreciate the importance of introduc- 
ing instruction in manual work into their schools. They have already begun to give 
instruction of this kind to some few of their teachers, with a view to qualify them for 
imparting it to the children in the schools; but, in order that this instruction may 
be satisfactory, it is important that the training of the teachers themselves should be 
systematic and thorough; and, obvious as this might appear to be, we do not hesi- 
tate to impress it upon the minds of the authorities of the national board. Until the 
teachers are able themselves to give the instruction, it might be given by skilled and 
intelligent artisans. We have reason to believe that, whenever efficient teachers can 
be found, the national board will be prepared to pay for the results of manual teach- 
ing in the primary schools. It is scarcely necessary to say that our statement with 
regard to drawing, in reference to schools generally, applies with equal force to the 
Trish schools. We may remark that the progress of children in learning home trades 
will be much more satisfactory if they have been trained at school in the use of the 
ordinary tools for working in wood and iron and in drawing. 
We shall deal with instruction in agriculture in Ireland in the succeeding subsec- 
tion, in which we review the separate report of Mr. Jenkins and the evidence which 
we personally received in Ireland on that special branch of the subject. 
Compulsory attendance in Irish primary schools.—While dealing with Irish education, 
we cannot refrain from expressing our satisfaction at having found that public opinion 
among all classes in Ireland is in.favor of some measure for gradually making pri- 
mary education in that country compulsory. The subject is one surrounded with difti- 
culties of a nature which appear to us 4 place the discussion of its details beyond the 
scope of our commission. We consider, however, that we should not do our duty if 
we did not express our decided opinion that no marked progress in the direction of 
technical education can be effected in Ireland until primary education in that country 
has been placed on a proper footing. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
As stated at the commencement of this report, your commissioners did not think 
that an inquiry into the instruction of the industrial classes would be complete unless 
it included some notice of the instruction of the large and important class of agri- 
culturists. 
We were unable ourselves to conduct this branch of the inquiry, except partially 
in regard to Ireland, but we trust that those who read the report on agricultural 
education of our subcommissioner, Mr. H..M. Jenkins, the secretary of the Royal 
Agricultural Society of England, submitted herewith, will think that we have been 
well advised in placing the inquiry in his hands. As supplementary to his report, 
your commissioners refer to the Irish evidence in the appendix and to the narrative 
of their visits to the Royal Albert College, at Glasnevin, to the Munster Dairy School, 
and to parts of the south and west of Ireland. We have not inquired into the state of 
agriculture, as an art, abroad and at home; to have done this would have lengthened 
the inquiry beyond measure, and it was the less needed, as this branch of the question 
has been incidentally treated in the recent report of the royal commission on agri- 
culture. It will, however, be seen from the report of our subcommissioner that those 
best able to form an opinion attribute a great and beneficial influence upon the prog- 
ress of agriculture to the agricultural schools of various grades of the continent, and 
more especially to those like Hohenheim and Grignon, in which practice is combined 
with scientific teaching. 
At a time like the present, when cheap railway and water conveyance of agricult- 
ural products from distant countries has completely changed the economical condi- 
tions of successful agriculture in Great Britain, it is of the greatest importance that 
those who are interested in the cultivation of the soil, whether as proprietors or as 
farmers, should not simply be familiar with existing practices at home, important as 
is such a familiarity, but that they should understand also the reasons which have 
caused these practices to prevail, in order to be able to decide to what extent they 
should continue to be pursued. They should likewise be acquainted with the nature 
and mode of cultivation of crops, the rearing and feeding of cattle, and the dairy 
practice of other countries. 
1The practice of growing beet roots for the manufacture of sugar has been attended with most beneficial changes in continental agriculture. This cultivation is carried on in countries varying re- 
markably in the conditions of climate in regard to heat and moisture. Should the recovery of am- 
monia in ths manufacture of coke and from the raw coal used in the blast-furnace be attended with 
the success which there is every reason to anticipate, the cheapening of nitrogenous manures may 
indicate some considerable changes in the agricultural practice of our own country.
-P-A-G-E-285
  
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN EUROPE. CCLXXXV 
Higher agricultural schools.—To impart knowledge of this description is the proper 
function of the agricultural school. In Great Britain the agricultural department of 
the normal school of South Kensington, the Royal Agricultural College of Cirencester, 
and the College of Downton are the only institutions for higher agricultural education, 
the former principally for training teachers, the two latter for the education of land own- 
ers, land agents, and farmers. The first of these has been so short a time in existence 
that no definite judgment of its results can be formed by the test of practical success or 
failure. But we agree with our subcommissioner in thinking that the complete course 
of four years at the normal school is inconyeniently and unnecessarily long, that at 
least all students who propose to become associates should on entrance prove that they 
possess the amount of practical knowledge of agriculture which can be acquired by a 
year’s residence on a farm, and that visits to farms and factories connected with agri- 
culture during the recess should be encouraged and rewarded by scholarships to those 
who have profited by them. Our subcommissioner considers that colleges like those 
of Cirencester and Downton do not require ‘‘ propping” by the state, but that schol- 
arships tenable at those colleges might be given by the government to deserving stu- 
dents in the agricultural divisions of county schools. 
Secondary agricultural schools.—These agricultural divisions which are intended by 
our subcommissioner to provide secondary agricultural instruction have still to be 
created. Mr. Jenkins proposes that farms should be attached to county schools, in 
which the pupils in the higher forms should be taught the principles and practice of 
farming and should take part in farming operations and the management of stock. 
The experience of schools of this kind on the continent and of some isolated attempts 
in this country shows that they cannot be self supporting. He proposes that the lo- 
cality (the county) should equip the school and, we suppose, the farm attached to it, 
and that the government should contribute as liberally to the buildings as to those 
of schools of science. We can see no objection to the latter proposal, and we approve 
of the suggestion that the governing bodies of counties should have the power of es- 
tablishing and maintaining agricultural schools or contributing thereto under proper 
conditions ; we should be glad to see this power conferred on them by the proposed 
measure for reorganizing county government. But it would also appear to us that 
an active participation in the encouragement of secondary agricultural schools would 
be an object well worthy of our great national agricultural societies. Their funds 
have hitherto been devoted mainly to the encouragement by premiums of improve- 
ments in cattle breeding and in agricultural machinery. The commercial demand 
for animals of a high class and for implements of the best construction is now so 
great that any other than an honorary recognition of merit seems to be no longer re- 
quired; and, if a portion only of the money now distributed in prizes were offered in 
aid of local subscriptions for the addition of an agricultural department to the existing 
and in many cases flourishing county schools, it is probable that so desirable an ex- 
periment as that proposed by our subcommissioner would very soon be carried into 
effect. 
We are aware that the fact of the number of competitors for the Royal Agricultural 
Society’s junior scholarships having been small may not encourage that great society 
to increase its efforts in the direction of agricultural education, but we believe with 
Mr. Jenkins that the fault lies in a great measure with the want of competent teachers, 
a want which is now in the course of being supplied by the Normal School of Science 
and otherwise. With respect to the classes in the ‘‘ principles of agriculture” in 
connection with the Science and Art Department, which properly come under the 
head of secondary instruction, Mr. Jenkins is of opinion that ‘the attempt to teach 
the principles of a subject without first teaching its facts and phenomena is very 
much like trying to build an actual castle in the air.” We quite agree in this opinion, 
and we consider it essential, even if it should involve some change in the program 
of the department, that the examiners should so arrange their questions as to as- 
certain as far as possible from his replies that the student is acquainted with facts 
to which the principles are applicable, just as in chemistry, for instance, the examiner 
would not be satisfied with a mere knowledge of the laws affecting the combinations 
of chemical elements and compounds, but would expect the student to be acquainted 
with the nature and properties of the substances entering into combination. Un- 
fortunately, there is not the same room for a practical examination in agriculture as 
that which is now very properly required by the department in other sciences. On 
the whole it may be expected that young men following the profession of farmers 
and acquainted with farming practice will derive advantage from the classes in the 
theory of agriculture which are held in county towns. 
Farm apprentice schools.— Of our subcommissioner’s suggestions in regard to lower 
agricultural education in Great Britain, that which recommends the apprenticeship 
of youths to selected farmers is very importantif it can be carried out. There can 
be nd doubt that, if competent farmers can be found willing to receive boys and girls 
as apprentices (the girls in the dairy), and to allow nar of their time to be spent 
in continuing their school instruction, as is suggested by Mr. Jenkins, there could 
   
-P-A-G-E-286
  CCLXXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
be no better training for the pupils. The French fermes-écoles and German Acker- 
bauschnlen are examples of this kind of training. 
Instruction in agriculture in rural elementary schools — His recommendations in ref- 
erence to elementary schools in rural districts are more definite. We agree with 
him in thinking that imstrnction in the theory and practice of agriculture should, 
in Great Britain, as it already does in Ireland, after suitable introductory object 
lessons, form in the upper standards a part of the ordinary elementary subjects 
of rural schools, and should not be relegated to “class subjects;” and that, if time 
cannot otherwise be found for them, which we scarcely anticipate, some of the ele- 
mentary subjects, such as the higher branches of arithmetic, should be transferred 
from¢the former to the latter category; and, further, that encouragement should be 
given, by way of grants, to practical work on plots of land attached to such schools. 
One good result of this would probably be that children, takin & a more intelligent 
interest in farm work, would be less anxious to migrate from the country into the 
larger towns. 
It is probable that, if a demand existed for a practical knowledge of agriculture 
on the part of teachers in rural schools, some of the farmers’ sons who at present un- - 
healthily increase the competition for farms would qualify themselves to become ele- 
mentary teachers. 
Agricultural education in Ireland.— The subject of agricultural education, which is of 
national interest in Great Britain, is a question of life and death for Ireland. We are 
happy to find that this is thoroughly felt both by the government and by the people. 
There is progress in all directions. The Albert Agricultural Institution at Glasnevin, 
near Dublin, no longer confines itself to the instruction of young men who intend to 
become farmersor land agents, but is training teachers who will disseminate a knowl- 
edge of sound theory and likewise of successful practice throughout Ireland; for the 
G@lasnevin farms, the 6-acre as well as the 100-acre, are pecuniarily successful. The 
Munster Agricultural and Dairy School, especially its dairy department, as will appear 
from the evidence given before us, is ascertained and acknowledged by all classes to 
be rendering eminent service to the farmers of the county of Cork. Every elementary 
teacher in Ireland is required to pass an examination in agriculture, and the science 
and practice of agriculture are taught to all boys in the three upper standards (or 
classes, as they are called in Ireland) of all rural schools. Last year nearly 45,000 boys 
were examined in this subject. Small farms are attached to some of these schools, 
and special grants are made for proficiency in practical agriculture as tested on 
those farms. What is most encouraging is that the authorities of the national board 
themselves are not satistied with what is being done. They are anxious that more 
encouragement should be given to the patrons of schools to furnish them with small 
example farms; they admit that when this is done results cannot be effectively 
gauged by their single agricultural inspector, Mr. Carroll, in addition to his duties 
as head of the Glasnevin institution. Your commissioners believe that the board 
would gladly see the successful experiment of the Cork Dairy School repeated in other 
parts of Ireland, each such school being established, as at Cork, by local effort, con- 
ducted by local managers in accordance with the wants of the locality, and supported 
in part by local subscriptions. Your commissioners trust that the treasury would see 
its way clear to encourage and aid such schools by grants out of imperial funds. 
The evidence shows that the members of some boards of guardians are not satisfied 
with the prevailing absence of agricultural instruction for the children in the Irish 
workhouses. They desire that the plots of land attached to the workhouses should be 
more generally used than they now are, for this instruction. 
At the same time the faults of the past are acknowledged. It was stated in evi- 
dence before us that the failure to introduce the cultivation of flax in the south of 
Ireland was due in a great measure to the ignorance of the instructors and to their 
haying persuaded the people to grow it on unsuitable land, with the result of stunted 
crops, badly prepared, and scarcely fit for the commonest tissues. 
That some of the instructors were ignorant we cannot doubt; but the example of 
Flanders and other countries shows that flax can be grown on the poorest soils, pro- 
vided that they are liberally manured and receive such painstaking and assiduous 
cultivation as the peasants of those countries bestow on them. Failures, however, 
like that of flax culture in the south of Ireland will induce the promoters of agricult- 
ural education in that country to proceed with caution, and not to raise a prejudice 
against it by schemes for which the teachers are not qualified and the learners are 
not ripe. 
Following this summary the commissioners make a number of recommendations. 
Of these the following paragraphs give an account sufficient for present purposes in 
this country. The board recommends for “public elementary schools” that rudiment- 
ary drawing be incorporated with writing as a single elementary subject, and that 
instruction in elementary drawing be continued throughout the standards (classes);
-P-A-G-E-287
  PUBLIC INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOL, CCLEXXVIL 
‘that drawing from casts and models be required as part of the work, and that model- 
ling be encouraged by grants; that a school shall not be deemed to be provided with 
sufficient and suitable apparatus of elementary instruction unless it have a proper 
supply of casts and models for drawing ; that proficiency in the use of tools for work- 
ing in wood and iron be paid for as a “specific subject,” the work to be done, when 
practicable, out of school hours; that the collection of objects, casts, and drawings 
for school museums be encouraged ; that children under fourteen in England, as al- 
ready in Scotland, be prohibited from working ‘full time” in factories and work- 
shops; and that, for the rural schools, instruction in agriculture be made obligatory 
in the upper grades, 
The commissioners also recommend that the Science and Art Department should 
make instruction in science more practical and systematic, should admit artisans to 
the science and art classes without payment of fees, should insist on the applica- 
bility of artistic designs to the material in which they are to be executed, and should 
supply local museums of industrial design with original examples tending to improve 
the industries of the districts in which the museums are situated. 
As to the “training colleges” (normal schools), they recommend that the teaching 
of science and art be made efficient and, for the most promising pupils, more extended. 
Respecting public libraries, they advise that localities having less than 5,000 in- 
habitants be put on the same footing as those having more, aud that ratepayers be 
given the power to increase the expenditure for libraries in their localities when 
desirable. 
The remarkable document from which I have made these extracts was prepared 
under the direction of Messrs. B.Samuelson, H. E. Roscoe, Philip Magnus, John 
Slagg, Swire Smith, and William Woodall, the board of commissioners, of which Gil- 
bert R. Redgrave, esq., was the secretary.? © 
THE PUBLIC INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOL OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. 
This school was established under the direction of Charles G. Leland and opened 
on the first Tuesday in May, 1881. It was maintained by an appropriation from the 
funds of the school board, under control of the art committee, Messrs. William 
Galagher, Wright, Sheddon, and Cooper. This appropriation for the first two years 
was $1,500, but only half the sum was spent by the school, the rest being devoted 
to teaching drawing in other schools, to an exhibition, &c. 
The school began with 150 pupils of from 12 to 16 years of age, all sent from the 
public grammar schools, each teacher of which was allowed to select a limited num- 
ber of applicants. Nine-tenths, if not more, of these were from 13 to 15 years old. 
They were divided into two classes of about 75 each, one attending on Tuesdays from 
3to5 Pp. M., the other on Thursdays at the same hours. A class in brass repoussé was 
held on Saturday afternoons from 2 to 5. 
All the pupils were obliged to begin with lessons in design, according to Mr. Le- 
land’s method of simple outline decotative work in curves. As soon as a boy or girl 
could make a design fit to be “put in hand,” he or she was allowed to take up any 
branch of work taught in the school. 
‘These other branches were embroidery, wood carving, modelling inclay with colorand 
glaze, and rudimentary decorative oil painting—subsequently increased by carpenters’ 
work, cabinet making, mosaic setting, inlaying, scroll sawing, and sheet leather work. 
There is no definite limit, however, as to the branches taught, the principle tested 
being this, that any pupil who can design and has learned to model in clay can turn 
his or her hand almost at once to any kind of decorative art. This has been fully

tested, as there is no pupil in the second year who cannot turn his hand successfully to 
anything. The seeing others work, the being in an atelier where many kinds of work 
are going on, teaches them to regard them all as one. 
The business of the school (i. e., purchasing art materials, paying all bills, keeping 
the accounts, calling the rol], and looking after the children) was in the hands of 
Miss Elizabeth Robins, who was also treasurer of the Ladies’ Art Club, 
The general direction of all branches of study, excepting design, was under charge 
of Mr. J. Liberty Todd. Both of these assistants gave their services gratis the first 
year. : 
The teacher of brass repoussé was Theo. Heustis; that of wood carving, Bernard 
Uhle; of embroidery, Miss L. Moss, who also gave her labor gratis for more than a 
year. Being obliged to leave on account. of ill-health, her place was filled by Miss 
Annie R. Springer. Mr. Liberty Todd teaches modelling, painting, mosaic, and pot- 
tery. Carpentry, scroll sawing, cabinet making, and inlaying or marquetry are 
taught by Eugene Bowman (colored). 
The school was from the beginning an experiment to ascertain what children could 
do, not an institute to teach art. A want of appreciation of this fact on the part of 
the public has been the only source of the only troubles which the school lias experi- 
enced. The general outcry has been, teach boys while at school a practical trade, 
by which they can get aliving. The Leland experiment was made solely to find out * 
what boys and girls are capable of learning. The result has been to prove beyond 
doubt that all children taxing one or two lessons a week in an atelier can in two years’ 
time learn not one but several arts so well that they can obtain paid situations. On 
one occasion the head of a factory offered to take forty of the designing class at once 
into paid employment. 
No effort was made to sell the work of the pupils, but much valuable and beautiful 
glazed and colored pottery was made which had a high market value. The panels 
produced by the wood carvers, owing to the ability of the teacher, Prof. B. Uhle, are 
decidedly superior to the average work seen in cabinet making. There are 30 boys 
and girls in this class (3 colored), and there is not one who could not earn $9 a 
week. All of the pupils can design a piece of work, model it in clay, and then carve 
it. All the wood carvers are encouraged to make their work up in the carpenter 
shop. 
Orders are sometimes received and executed. These are for designs, repoussé, &c. 
It has been fully proved that, if the building or rooms can be provided with an outfit, 
such a school can be made to pay its expenses, as is the case with the Midhat Pasha 
school in Damascus. This would require, however, a special out-of-door agent to 
solicit orders and sell goods. 
A close study of the pupils themselves by the director developed these facts: 
(1) That one or two afternoons’ work in the week at the art school, far from inter- 
fering with the regular school studies, seems to aid them materially. This is the 
opinion of the teachers in the grammar schools. 
(2) That the pupils in the art school began to take a greater interest in reading of 
all kinds, and that in visiting exhibitions or when seeing art work or tasteful manu- 
factures they criticize what is before them with more ability than grown persons dis- 
play who have not been trained to understand design and its applications. 
(3) That the children all regard the art work of the school as being as attractive as 
any amusement; and as the drawing is not mere copying, but original design, they 
regard it also as agreeable employment. If the bell did not ring to summon them to 
cease, the pupils would apparently never leave off designing, modelling, and wood 
carving. In one school of 87 pupils every one entered his or her name for a place in 
the industrial school. 
CONGRESSES AND EXHIBITIONS. 
The facilities afforded at international congresses and exhibitions for the exchange 
of ideas, processes, and products have been so thoroughly demonstrated in the past
-P-A-G-E-289
CONGRESSES AND EXHIBITIONS. CCLXXXIX 
that I need not dwell on this topic. The number and variety of such meetings are 
increasing year by year. Among those lately held, now in progress, or announced for 
the near future are the following: 
The Central German Committee on Handicraft and Household Industries opened 
an exhibition in June, 1882, at Leipzig, of handiwork done by pupils in manual labor 
and industrial schools. In July, 1882, a Congress of Schools for the Blind was held 
at Frankfort-on-the-Main, at which Dr. Arends’s ingenious system of stenography 
for blind persons was specially exhibited and advised as a subject of tuition. In 
May of the present year, the General German Teachers’ Congress has been held 
at Bremen, and the exhibition of material illustrative of its researches was classi- 
fied under twelve heads, viz: literature; geology, mineralogy, and biology; phys- 
ics; chemistry; technology; geography; history; religion; elementary instruction ; 
drawing; mathematics; and collective exhibits of schools and societies. A finely 
organized and most instructive exhibition of colonial development at Amsterdam 
was also opened in May and will continue till October, 1883, at which provision 
has been made for displays relating to schools and systems of elementary, secondary, 
middle, and higher education; to books and apparatus of instruction ; to drawings 
and models of school buildings; and, finally, to the results of missionary labors on 
colonial populations, The International Fisheries Exhibition at London is attract- 
ing crowds of visitors and immense scientific interest. The government of Brazil 
announced an elaborate educational congress at Rio Janeiro for the summer months 
of the year 1883 (which, of course, are pleasantly cool in the southern hemisphere); 
the president of the congress is the Count d’Eu, son-in-law of the emperor, and the 
government has expressed a special desire that the education of this country should 
be exhibited on this occasion. The groups are school architecture, school furniture, 
apparatus and material for class room instruction, text books, and educational treat- 
ises and reports. 
In order that the desires of the Dutch and Brazilian governments might be made 
known as widely as possible to Americans interested in these matters, I have taken 
special measures to place information relative to the exhibitions at Amsterdam and 
Rio Janeiro before the educators of the country. 
An interesting exhibition for competitive designs and models of school architecture 
has just closed in Paris, and a Congress of Provident Institutions (such as school say- 
ings banks, &c.) is open thore while I write. Without specifying minutely other in- 
ternational meetings announced for the future, I cannot close this brief enumeration 
before inviting special attention to the International Health Exhibition to be held at 
London in 1884, at which school hygiene will be fully represented, and to the Inter- 
national Prison Congress at Rome in the same year. 
If this Office were put in possession of a small sum annually for the purpose, it © 
could make effective and useful displays of American education on these occasions, 
and thereby largely increase the knowledge of other communities respecting the most 
unique feature of our national life. : 
Among domestic exhibitions every one will recall the excellently managed cotton 
exposition at Atlanta, Ga., during the winter of 1882~83; the very large and well at- 
tended exhibition at Louisville, Ky., now progressing (in which this Office has made 
a small but typical exhibit); and the comprehensive and interesting display of her 
mineral resources that Colorado presented at the Denver exhibition. Interesting feat- 
ures in the future are the two large exhibitions during the coming autumn in Boston, 
one chiefly of foreign articles, the other chiefly domestic, at which North Carolina will 
make an unequalled display of her agricultural and mineral resources, as also the 
proposition to hold a great international exhibition in 1884 at New Orleans, with spe- 
cial reference to the development of trade between the United States and the Spanish 
Main,

  CCxe REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
FORESTRY. 
The interest in forestry is increasing in extent and intensity as the injurious effects 
of the diminution of our wooded areas are more fully realized. Societies for the pres- 
eryation of forests and the cultivation of trees are being organized and their gath- 
erings attract much attention. The meeting of the American Forestry Congress at 
Montreal, August, 1882, was attended by many representative men from the North- 
ern and Western States. The objects of this association are to discuss matters relate 
ing to arboriculture, collect forest statistics, advance educational, legislative, and 
other measures tending to the promotion of forest culture and preservation, unify the 
plans for work, and diffuse knowledge ascertained. A State Forestry Association ex- 
ists in Ohio. It has a committee on arbor day. An extract from a circular issued by 
Hon. John B. Peaslee, of Cincinnati, chairman of the committee, will give an idea of 
the purposes it seeks toaccomplish. After urging the importance of instructing youth 
in the value and utility of forests and the cultivation and protection of forest trees, 
the committee says: 
The most impressive way of imparting the instruction and of interesting the pupils 
in the subject is through the celebration of tree planting. We therefore earnestly re- 
quest you to have the pupils under your charge plant trees on arbor day, the fourth Fri- 
day of April, with appropriate ceremonies. We suggest that the trees be planted in 
the school grounds, by the roadside, or in parks or commons, and that they be planted 
in honor and memory of American authers, thus ‘‘ making trees monuments of history 
and character.” 
We suggest also that the exercises consist of reading compositions on the importance 
and usefulness of forests, of reciting selections on trees from various authors, of giving 
extracts from and sketches of the life and writings of the particular author in whose 
honor or memory each tree or group is planted, of singing, of the ceremony of throwing 
the soil—each pupil in turn—about the trees, and of appropriate talks by trustees, 
teachers, and others. 
In other States school authorities have encouraged the planting and protection of 
trees. Hon. B. G. Northrop, formerly secretary of the Connecticut State board of edu- 
cation, inaugurated a movement which is improving the surroundings of schools in 
rural districts almost beyond recognition. In West Virginia the State superintendent, 
Hon. B. L. Butcher, has made successful efforts to celebrate arbor day and otherwise 
to promote tree culture, The 27th of April, 1883, was recommended as a suitable 
occasion for planting trees for the adornment of school grounds, and was very gener- 
ally celebrated in that way. This Office has published a letter, written by Dr. Franklin 
B. Hough, on planting trees in school grounds, which contains directions as to time 
and place of planting. 
The study of forestry is pursued in the agricultural colleges of many States, especi- 
ally in the West. Forest culture is under the charge of a separate professor of horti- 
culture and botany in the Ohio State University and it is one of the junior year 
studies in the agricultural course of Purdue University, Indiana. Pomology and 
forestry are included among the special studies in horticulture in the Illinois Industrial 
University. Forest plantations, wind breaks, hedges, and ornamental trees are dis- 
cussed in the Iowa Agricultural College, and its grounds are an object lesson in tree 
planting and cultivation. The study of arboriculture in the Minnesota State Univer- 
sity includes the consideration of the reasons for planting forest trees, kinds to be 
chosen for planting, methods of propagating, care in the nursery, and special culture of 
each species. 
The School of Political Science of the University of Michigan has an attractive 
course of instruction in forestry. The historical development of the science, the in- 
fluence of forests on human affairs, the control of wood lands, and forest legislation 
in Europe and America are subjects considered. Prof. C. K. Adams, dean of the 
school, says: 
The course on forestry has naturally attracted much attention ; and it is not a little 
singular that a subject of so much importance has hitherto been entirely neglected 
by our colleges and universities. Within the past few years the necessity of some
-P-A-G-E-291
FORTHCOMING CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION. CCxCl 
eare of our forests has impressed itself upon the people of our country as never before. 
Their rapid disappearance in some parts of the land is a matter of the gravest con- 
sequence. Not only are vast economic questions directly involved in the destruction 
ot timber, but, what is, perhaps, of even greater importance, if this destruction is not 
properly guarded against or counterbalanced by the judicious planting and care of 
trees, even our climate is in great danger of. being permanently changed. In this 
State our forests are a great source of wealth, and there is no one of our industrial 
resources that is worthy of more careful study. We have recently had painful admo- 
nitions that the unwise cutting away of our forests may be attended with the most 
appalling consequences. The mere statement of these facts is enough to show that 
the subject is entitled to the most careful consideration, In the Old World schools of 
forestry have long devoted themselves to a systematic study of the various ways in 
which the questions that now perplex us in regard to the care of forests are best to be 
met. As the fruit of studies carried on in these schools, and the consequent wise 
management of forests, Germany is much less likely to suffer in the near future from 
the want of the different kinds of the useful woods than is the United States. An 
important literature on the subject has grown up; and althongh it is not to be sup- 
posed that the methods adapted to European requirements can be transferred to 
America without essential modifications, yet it is certain that great advantage may 
be gained from a familiarity with the results of European study and experience. 
Prof. J. T. Rothrock, of the University of Pennsylvania, has given from fourteen 
to eighteen lectures annually on botany and tree culture for some years past in Hor- 
ticultural Hall, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. I am indebted to Hon. Eli K. Price 
for the following account of the origin of this course of lectures: 
The history of the free lectures in the Fairmount Park by Professor Rothrock is this: 
André Frangois Michaux, of Vauréal, near Pontoise, France, by his will, dated 4th 
September, 1855, gave the income of his estate to his widow for life, and after her 
death $12,000 to the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia and $8,000 to 
the Society of Agriculture and Art of Boston, Mass. By an earlier will, revoked by the 
last, his chief purpose was to promote the culture of trees, which himself and father 
had so much loved, and to that purpose the American Philosophical Society have de- 
voted all the income of the legacy since the death of the widow, directly or indi- 
rectly. The direct mode is the gift of half the income in the purchase and planting 
of tree seeds and trees, and thence making distribution into our park and to other parks, 
the city, institutions, and individuals, and especially to churches and schools, meet- 
ing houses, cemeteries, and graveyards. The indirect mode is by applying the other 
half of the income in support of the lectures on botany, sylviculture, and forestry, 
as a basis to effect the further purpose of the testator, namely, by tree culture to 
promote agriculture; both as a protection from high winds and severe cold and as at- 
tractors of rain and the prevention of droughts, and also by the preservation of natu- 
ral springs. 
     
SUBJECTS RESERVED FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT. 
Teachers’ institutes, city school systems, instruction in shorthand, instruction in 
physics, the detection and measurement of impurities in the air, the study of hygiene, 
and decisions on questions of school law are among the subjects now being investi- 
gated under the direction of this Office. The results of these studies will be pub- 
lished as they are completed by the persons undertaking them. The appropriation 
and expenditure of money, the length of session, the plans of management, and re- 
sults are topics to be discussed in relation to teachers’ institutes. The plans and 
differences of administration of city schools, their courses of study, methods of gov- 
ernment, and the management of details will be presented from a practical stand- 
point. 
Instruction in shorthand has increased rapidly for a few years past, and the schools 
in which it alone is taught or is a prominent feature are becoming numerous. The 
statistics of the study are being collected in a most thorough manner and a bib- 
liography of English and American works on the subject is being prepared. The 
growth of this study and the call for those skilled in the practice of the art indicate 
the interest now taken in the provisions made for instruction and in its literature. 
The object of the inquiry respecting instruction in physics is to obtain a full dis- 
cussion and comparison of views with regard to the systematization of the study of 
this branch of science, so that different classes of schools should give instruction of a 
different kind, according to their grade. This is made desirable because at present

CCXCII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the same ground is passed over in colleges that has previously been covered by the 
course in high schools and academies. 
The inquiry into the study of hygiene is to cover the most practical ground, ascer- 
taining the examinations of candidates for admission into various classes of schools, 
both as to their knowledge of the laws of hygiene and as to their physical condition; 
the gymnastic exercises or military drill required or expected of either sex; the 
provision for medical attendance upon students; the character and equipment of 
gymnasiums; the management of athletic sports and intercollegiate contests; and 
the opinions of experienced men on the effects of special forms of exercise. 
The decisions relating to school law will be obtained by an examination of the 
cases which have been decided in the highest courts of the various States in recent 
years. Such points are to be selected from these as have a public bearing upon edu- 
cational interests, such as the constitutionality of measures, the manner of conduct- 
ing school meetings, the formation of school districts, and the administration of 
their affairs, the duties and liabilities of officers and teachers, and the discipline of 
the school. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
Irecommend the publication of twenty thousand copies of this report for the use 
the Office. This will only enable it to supply its correspondents, and whatever may 
be deemed best to distribute under the personal direction of members of the Senate 
and House of Representatives should be in addition to this number.! 
The organization of the educational museum in connection with this Office, which 
Ihave had the honor to recommend, now constituting a collection of great value 
and more and more visited and studied by teachers and school officers, should have 
a sufficient appropriation to enable it, by exchange and otherwise, to supply similar 
collections in the offices of the several State superintendents and the leading cities 
when desired. A new and important additional demand has been made upon the 
collection for supplying exhibits where educational collections are presented in 
State and other expositions. There can be no question of the effective aid these 
collections would render to the progress of education. Through this Office the best 
illustrations of improved appliances should be collected and distributed to all parts 
of the country. 
The reports of efforts to educate the youth of 30,000 Alaskans continually disclose 
the embarrassments arising from all absence of local administration of law. Itis said 
the parents are disposed to have their children taught and the pupils learn readily, 
but it is clear there can be no satisfactory success, that the entire youth cannot be 
reached, until some form of law is provided for the organization of society. The 
pledges of the past and the honor of the nation would seem to permit no delay. Some 
inexpensive form of organization can be devised, and an appropriation of $50,000, it 
is believed, would give the work of education an excellent start, and is earnestly 
recommended.? 
I renew most earnestly the following recommendations : 
(1) I recommend that the office of superintendent of public instruction for each 
Territory be created, to be filled by appointment by the President, the compensation 
to be fixed and paid as in the case of other federal appointees for the Territories. 
(2) In view of the large number of children growing up in ignorance on account of 
the impoverished condition of portions of the country, and in view of the special diffi- 
culties in the way of establishing and maintaining therein schools for universal edu- 
cation, and in consideration of the imperative need of immediate action in this regard, 
Irecommend that the whole or a portion of the net proceeds arising from the sale of 
  
1 As this report goes through the press Congress has passed a joint resolution ordering the publi- 
cation of thirty-eight thousand copies of this report, twenty thousand for the use of this Office, as 
recommended, six thousand for the use of the Senate, and twelve thousand for the use of the House 
of Representatives.

  CONCLUSION. CCXCIIz 
public Jands be set aside as a special fund, the interest of said fund to be divided an- 
nually pro rata among the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia, 
under such provisions in regard to amount, allotment, expenditure, and supervision 
as Congress in its wisdom may deem fit and proper. The returns of the last census 
emphasize the importance of this recommendation. The per cent. of illiteracy of per- 
sons 10 years of age and upward has decreased from 20.05 in 1870 to 17 in 1880, but 
the number of illiterates over 10 years of age has increased from 5,658,144 to 6,239,958 
in the same period. 
(3) Irecommend the enactment of a law requiring that all facts in regard to national 
aid to education and all facts in regard to education in the Territoriesand the District 
of Columbia necessary for the information of Congress be presented through this Office. 
(4) I recommend an increase of the permanent force of the Office. The experience of 
the Office indicates clearly that the collection of educational information and publica- 
tion of the same, as required by the law regulating it, cannot be properly done with 
the present limited clerical force. 
CONCLUSION. 
I take pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to the faithful laborers in the. 
Office and to all others elsewhere who have contributed to the success of its work. 
Ihave the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commissioner.

  PREFATORY NOTE. 
‘The following abstracts of education in the States and Territories are derived from a great variety ofsources. First among these come reports of State officials, such as State boards of education and State superintendents of instruction; next, those of county and city superintendents, school com- mittees, acting school visitors, and principalsof State institutions. From these are derived nearly all the information given respecting elementary and special instruction, city school systems, and nor- mal schools, and much of that relating to secondary, schools, as the high schools of the States and cities. What concerns private secondary schools is almost wholly from returns made by the princi- pals of these to the Bureau of Education, supplemented by catalogues and other documents. For the matter relating fo universities, colleges, and scientific and professional schools, depend- ence is placed on the annual catalogues of such institutions, on occasional circulars issued by them, and on special returns, made usually in the autumnal and winter months, in reply to circulars of inquiry sent them by the Bureau. In every instance, official authority only is relied upon for statements distinctly and definitely made, the printed catalogues and reports being chiefly used for this purpose, though sometimes an item of interesting information from other than official sources may be given, with a reference to the quarter from which it is derived. In such cases, however, the éffort is always made to verify the statement before it is committed to the press. ‘The matter derived from the various sources above indicated is formulated, in the abstracts of education for each State, substantially in accordance with the schedule given below.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
‘These are (1) a State superintendent of education, elected by the people; (2) a superin- 
tendent for each county, appointed by the State superintendent; (3) a township superin- 
tendent of schools, appointed by the county superintendent; and (4 acounty board ineach 
county, composed of the county superintendent and 2 teachers of his appointment, to 
examine teachers and organize institutes. The State, county, and township superin- 
tendents serve 2 years; the members of the county board, 1 year.
-P-A-G-E-299

OTHER FEATURES OF THE! SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained from the following sources: 6 per cent. interest on 
the proceeds of sales of lands granted by the United States; 4 per cent. intereston United 
States surplus revenue deposited with the State; net proceeds of a poll tax of $1.50 on 
every male inhabitant over 21 and under 45 years of age; an optional local tax in each 
county (except Mobile) of not more than 10 cents on $100 (not less than one-half to be 
used for pay of teachers in the county thus taxed); the annual proceeds of the sales of 
lands that may be given for the support of the public schools; an annual appropriation 
of $130,000 from any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated; and all sums 
accruing from escheats and licenses required by law to be paid into the school fund of any 
county. School moneys are distributed according to the number of children7 to 21 years _ 
of age. No denominational school is to share in the fund; while separate schools for 
whites and blacks must receive their pro rata shares and the amount of poll tax paid in 
by each race. All children of school age are entitled to the benefits of any public school 
for their own race in their district or township. Public examinations must be held in the 
schools at least once each year; and students who have completed the course of studies 
required receive from the board of education a certificate to that effect. The school 
month is 20 days, of not less than 6 hours each; the scholastic year extends from October 
1 to September 30. Teachers must be duly licensed, and they must make the required 
quarterly reports to the county superintendent before receiving their pay. They must 
attend at least one of the three annual institutes held in each county. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State superintendent regards the public school system of the State as a well de- 
vised and good one, adapted to the wants and condition of the people, the only necessity 
Peing an adequate fund to properly administer it. 
The statistics for 188182 show an increase of 12,999 in school population over the pre- 
vious year, while the school income was less by $4,574, with a decrease in expenditures 
of $7,088. Contrasting the two races, the figures show that while the white school popu- 
lation increased 3 per cent. the colored gained 3} per cent. In nearly allother respects 
the contrast is largely in favor of the whites. - Both had about the same proportionate 
increase in enrolment, while in average daily attendance (nearly 65 per cent. of the en- 
rolment) the whites gained 541 and the colored lost 1,330. Schools for whites increased 
by 77, those for blacks decreased 25; the number of white teachers was increased by 3, 
that of colored teachers was decreased by 137. In the grades of spelling, reading, writ- 
ing, geography, and grammar there was a large increase of pupils, while in arithmetic 
there was adecrease. The appeal of the State superintendent to the legislature, show- 
ing that with present means only 44.25 per cent. of the children of the State were enrolled 
and only 28.56 per cent. were in average daily attendance, it was hoped would secure 
the necéssary aid, especially as the reduction of the school fund was made when the 
State was overburdened with debt and taxation, and now the time had come when the 
State could do tardy justice to her children.—(State report.) 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
In fulfilment of the promise made the previous year, $5,000 of this fund were appro- 
priated to Alabama for the scholastic year 1882; the sum was disbursed as follows: For 
10 scholarships in the normal college at Nashville, Tenn., $2,000; for 16 scholarships in 
the State Normal School at Florence, $2,000; the remaining $1,000 was divided equally 
between the colored normal schools at Marion and Huntsville. In addition to this 
timely aid to the normal schools, which greatly enlarged the sphere of their usefulness, 
25 Peabody medals were offered for the highest degree of attainment in scholarship and 
deportment; after a lively contest, they were about equally divided between white and 
colored pupils in the normal and leading city schools.— (State report. ) . 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Montgomery and Selma are the only cities calling for notice that have city school sys- 
tems separate from those of the counties of which they forma part. Each has a city board 
of education and a superintendent of city schools. 
Mobile, reported under this head in preceding years, has neither city board nor city 
superintendent separate from those of the county of which the city is a part, and makes 
no report of city schools as distinct from the very numerous ones of the county. It is 
therefore omitted here.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Montgomery reported 2,054, or 54 per cent., of its school population as colored. There 
were 376 whites enrolled and 829 colored, with 360 whites in average daily attendance 
and 625 colored. In the white schools there were 47 whites to each teacher; in the colored 
schools, 138. The average length of schools for both races was 180 days as against 160 
the year before.— (State report. ) 
Selma reported a school population of 863 whites and 1,158 colored; but, unlike Mont- 
gomery, had a preponderance of school attendance on the white side, 424 whites being 
enrolled against 312 colored, and 382 whites appearing daily in the schools against 240 
colored. Two school-houses were reported, which, with other property, were valued at 
$10,000; there were 8 schools for white and 6 for colored pupils. With the same num- 
ber of schools as in 1880-81, there was an additional school building reported. Enrol- 
ment, however, was less by 151. The average time of school was 206 days, against 195 
the year before. There were 12 teachers of White and 6 of colored schools, while under 
each of the white teachers there were enrolled 35 pupils and under the colored 52, the 
average monthly pay of the white teachers being $85.40 and that of the colored $7. — 
(State report.) . 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In 1881~’82"there were 4 normal schools under the care of the State, 1 for white teachers 
and 3 for colored, all reported to be doing good work, their graduates being called for 
from all parts of the State. 
‘The State Normal School (for whites of both sexes), Florence, had 164 students in the 
school year 1881~’82, of whom 76 were normal, a gain of 8 over the previous year. The 
senior class of 7 received certificates of graduation, and 5 engaged in teaching, accord- 
ing to contract with the State. The school year opening September 6, 1882, promised 
still better results, the pupils in the first term numbering 12 more than in the previous 
session, 10 more being normal, and the class for graduation having 20 more members. 
Grateful mention is made of the help given to the school from the Peabody fund, by 
which 2 students have been able to complete and 14 others to undertake the normal 
course. Appropriation by State for payment of the faculty, $7,500.— (State report.) 
The Normal School for Colored Teachers, Huntsville, with the aid of the State and the 
Peabody fund, purchased, before the opening of the session of 1881—’82, a desirable school 
building in the city for $3,000. It had, for the session, 3 teachers and 227 pupils in all 
departments, 68 of them normal, of whom 4 were graduated. The next session opened 
wih 150, against 130 at the same time in the previous year. Its course of study covers 
4 years, There is a model school for practice teaching. Music, vocal and instrumental, 
is taught. The school had a library of 217 volumes, 150 of which were added during 
the year, with 10 pedagogical works. There were also 4 educational journals and maga- 
zines taken.— (State report and return. ) 
Linco Normal University (for colored students), Marion, for the school year 1881-82 
reported 5 instructors and 174 students, 128 being normal, of whom 9 graduated from 
its 4-year course and engaged in teaching.. A falling off of 50 from the attendance of 
the previous year was attributed to short crops and competition with other schools. 
There were 200 volumes in the library. There were the usual facilities for the study of 
drawing, vocal and instrumental music, chemistry, physics, and natural history.— (State 
report and return. ) 
Tuskegee Normal School (for colored teachers), Tuskegee, provided for by the legisla- 
ture of 1880, opened July 4, 1881, with 3 instructors and 30 students, closing its first 
session of 36 weeks with 112. The regular 4 years of study include all the branches 
laid down in the State law, with some others. The town public school, being on the 
grounds of the normal school, is used as a model school for the normal students. The 
school has a farm of 100 acres, used by pupils studying agriculture to defray a part 
of their expenses. On this farm was erected a 3-story building containing recitation 
rooms, a chapel, a reading room, an office, and dormitories for girls. To meet various

   the people of Tuskegee and friends at the North raised $5,522 and the State 
gave $2,000, while 600 volumes for a library, a cabinet organ, and many other valuable 
articles were donated by friends. This prosperous heginning, it is said, is owimg largely 
to the hearty codperation of the white and colored citizens of Tuskegee,— (State report.) 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS OR DEPARTMENTS. 
Rust Normal Institute (for colored), Huntsville, under the care of the Freedman’s Aid 
Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had 2 instructors and 111 students in 1880-'81 
and reported steady growth. 4 
Emerson Institute (for colored), Mobile, conducted by the American Missionary Asse- 
ciation, for 1881-’82 reported 9 instructors; 22 normal and 230 other pupils; a 4-year 
course of study, of 32 weeks each year; 100 volumes in the library, 25 of them pedagogical 
works, and 2 educational journals. Graduates receive diplomas, but are subject to ex- 
amination as teachers in the State. The school building, having burned down a see- 
ond time, was rebuilt on an enlarged scale, but at an expense not much above the 
insurance money.— (Return and American Missionary, 1882. 
Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School (for colored), Selma, is reported to 
have been the first school of its kind established and managed by the colored Baptists 
in America. It aims to educate colored teachers and supply the colored churches with 
an educated ministry; has a 3-year course, including vocal and instrumental musie; and 
in 1882 had 7 instructors and 151 students, normal students not designated.— (American 
Baptist Year Book.) 
In the normal department of Talladega College, Talladega, the course of 4 years is in- 
tended to prepare students to teach in the most advanced schools in the South, and to 
meet the demand for better teachers special attention is given to strictly normal work. 
A teachers’ institute is held at the close of the spring term. In 1881-’82 there were 36 
normal students.— (Catalogue and American Missionary, 1882.) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State superintendent reported that 122 teachers’ institutes (voluntary organiza- 
tions of teachers) were held in 1881~’82 in the different parts of the State and that the 
expenses of the same were a tax on teachers which he regarded as ae The insti- 
tutes, he thought, should besustained by public funds. He would have ont held yearly 
in each county, for each race, during one month, to be conducted by a thoroughly com- 
petent instructor. The present law, while it provides for holding at least three institutes 
annually and requires teachers to attend one of them, fixes no penalty for non-attendance 
and forbids involuntary assessments upon members. The superintendent would have 
the law changed in this respect also, as county superintendents complain of fhe non- 
attendance of teachers and the want of power to enforce attendance.— (State report. ) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. ° 
The Alabama Progress, a weekly educational journal edited and published by George 
P. Keyes, was established at Montgomery, April, 1882, under the auspices of the depart- 
ment of education, of which it is the official organ. Whe State superintendent speaks 
of it as steadily growing in popularity and circulation, and thinks it should be liberally 
supported by the friends of free education. — (State report.) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No provision for schools of this grade appears in the (latest) school law of 1879and no 
mention of such schools is made in the State report for 1881~82. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, was reported in 1880-’8t to have extended its 
curriculum and raised its standard of graduation. There were 2 general departments 
of instruction, academi¢ and professional, but no preparatory department. The academic 
comprised scientific and classical courses and was arranged under 9 schools. Candidates 
for the degree of B. A. were required to take either the full classical or full scientific

course, each of 4 years. Students unable to complete all the studies of oneof the regular 
courses are allowed to select a course of study from the 9 schools, and upon completion 
of the course of any school are entitled to a diploma of graduation in that school and 
are enrolled as alumni of the university. The session of 1881-’82 opened with 14 resi- 
dent professors and instructors, 173 undergraduate students, the above mentioned col- 
legiate courses of 4 years of 36 weeks each, and 6,000 volumes in the library. Students 
in the academic department are subject to military discipline and are required to reside 
in barracks.— (Catalogue of 1880-81 and return for 1882.) 
Southern University, Greensboro’ €Methodist Episcopal South), reported in 1881 th: 
presence of 69 students, under 6 instructors, with 2-year preparatory, 4-year classical, and 
3-year scientific eourses, arranged under'7 schools. ‘To the 4-year classical course was 
appended a master’s course of 1 year, the completion of which, after pursuing the 
regular course, was required for the degree of M. A. A return for 1882reports a tempo- 
rary suspension, but with a prospect of early reorganization.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Howard College, Marion (Baptist), continued its courses of study in 11 schools, in- 
cluding the usual classical and scientific studies, with a business school and a school 
of military art and science. For the degree of B. A. 4 years of classical study are re- 
quired. Certificates of distinction are given to undergraduates for distinguished at- 
tainments in any class of any school. A certificate with title of ‘‘distinguished under- 
graduate’? is conferred on a student who secures high standing in any three schools 
within one session. There were 8 resident professors, 103 students, 20 of them prepara- 
tory, with 7 graduates at the end of the year.— (Catalogue and return.) 
A return from Spring Hill College, Mobile (Roman Catholic), gives a total of 20 in- 
structors and 168 studefits for the year ending October 1, 1882.

their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For information regarding the colleges for this sex alone, reference is made to Table

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, Auburn, has four reg- 
ular degree courses, each covering 4 years of 39 weeks, viz, a course in agriculture, 
with degree of B.S. A.; In engineering, with degree of B. E.; in literature, with degree 
of A. B.; in general science, with degree of B.s. The studies are the same in all for the 
first two years and the full course is followed by a graduate course of 1 year, on the com- 
pletion of which the graduate in engineering receives the degree of civil and mining 
engineer and the graduate in agriculture, literature, or science the degree of master in 
that course. There is also a department of military science and tactics, in which every 
able-bodied student is subjected to strict military discipline and training. There were 
9 professors and instructors and 122 students, 81 in the scientific and 41 in the pre- 
paratory department. Since its organization 901 have been matriculated, while only 94 
have graduated with degrees, owing to the large number of young men who, after two 
years’ study, leave the college to enter business. To accommodate such students, a 2- 
year special course has been established. Since 1879-’80 the increase of the regular 
college classes studying for degrees had been from 67 per cent. in that year to 83 per 
cent. at the close of 1882. There were,2,500 volumes in the library, college property 
was valued at $100,000, and the productive funds: were $253,500, affording an income 
of $20,280.—(Report of trustees, catalogue, and return.) 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.—The Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, Selma, for 1881- 
°82 reported 1 instructor; 45 students; a 5-year course of 32 weeks each, including pre- 
paratory and literary studies; and 400 volumes in library. 
The theological department of Talladega College (Congregational) had 2 instruc- 
tors and 14 students. Its full course of .study was 3 years of 34 weeks each; it had 
1,000 volumes in the library, property valued at $5,000, a productive fund of $5,000; and 
received during the year $5,000 for scholarships from the estate of R. R. Graves, of Moz- 
ristown, N. J. 
The Institute for Training Colored Ministers, Tuscaloosa (Presbyterian Church South), 
reported 30 students, under 2 instructors; a 3-year course of study of 43 weeks each; 
about a thousand volumes in the library; property valued at $2,000; and an income from 
contributions of the churches amounting Jast year to $3,200, besides. gift of $100 from

the late Edmund H. Payton, of New Jersey. All these schools require an examination 
for admission.— (Returns. ) 
Legal.—The law department of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, reported 3 in- 
structors; 25 students; 15 graduates; 2 years of 36 weeks each in the full course of study. 
Instruction by a weekly lecture was given in international and constitutional law; in 
common and statute law and in equity jurisprudence, by lectures and recitations.— 
(Catalogue and return. ) 
The law department of the Southern University, reported as having been suspended in 
1881, sends no report of resumption of studies in thi ensuing year. 
Medical.—The Medical College of Alabama, Mobile, for 1881-82 reported 11 in- 
structors; 60 students, 2 of whom had received degrees in letters or science; graduated 
16 with degree of M. D.; required 3 years’ study, of 20 weeks each; and had college prop- 
erty valued at $150,000. As many medical colleges have extended their courses of lect- 
ures and made instruction in the different departments more thorough and practical, the 
college announced that it would keep up with other institutions in every step to elevate 
the profession and raise the standard of medical education.— (Catalogue and return.) 
The medical department of Southern University, said to have been suspended in 
1881, has sent no report. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Alabama Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Talladega, was reported 
in 1880~’81 to have had a complete corps of instructors in both departments, the ordinary 
branches ofa practical English education being taught. There wastraining in shoemaking, 
cane seating, mattress making, printing, plumbing, gas fitting, and agriculture. Articu- 
lation was not taught. The Annals of the Deaf and Dumb, published at Washington, 
D. C., gives an attendance of 48 for the year 1882— males 28, females 20— but there is no 
distinct statement whether these included the deaf-mutes alone; instructors, 5, 3 of them 
mutes; value of buildings, $60,000; expenditure for support, $10,886; pupils from the 
beginning, 175.*~-(Annals of the Deaf and Dumb.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF COLORED SCHOOLS. 
‘The colored teachers and white teachers of colored schools, from all parts of the State, 
met in convention at Selma, April 6 and 7, 1882, when 60 members effected a permanent 
organization of a State Teachers’ Association, adopted a constitution, and elected officers. 
Papers, which are said by the State superintendent to have indicated remarkable advance- 
ment by the colored race, were read on ‘‘The teacher and his work,’ by Prof. Martin, 
of Montgomery; on ‘‘Text books,’? by Prof. Silsby, Selma; ‘‘The Quincy method,”’ by 
Prof. Patterson, Marion; ‘‘ Model lessons,’’ by Miss Holmes, Selma; ‘‘ How to secure 
the codperation of parents and guardians,’’ by Prof. Miles, Marion; followed by dis- 
cussion of the school law of the State, by Hon: H. C. Armstrong, State superintendent, 
and others. Prof. D, T. Washington, of Tuskegee, a colored graduate of Hampton, 
spoke with much force, it is said, on ‘‘ Industrial education.”” Entire harmony and the 
best of spirit are said to have prevailed, and the association adjourned to meet again at 
Montgomery the fizst week in April, 1883.— (Journal of Education and Present Age.) 
STATE ASSOCIATION OF WHITE SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
  ‘The white teachers met in convention at Bigmingham, July, 1882, for the first timein 
ten years, haying about the same attendance as the colored convention. State Super- 
intendent Armstrong was elected president. Among the papers read and the addresses 
made were “The schoolmaster,” ‘‘Graded schools,’’ ‘‘ Educational wants of the pres- 
ent time,” ‘Industrial education,” ‘‘Text books: what they are and what they 
should be,’’ “Normal schools,”’ ‘‘ Technical education of women,’’ ‘‘ How much and 
what mathematics should be taught in our common and high schools,’ ‘‘ Educational 
literature,” ‘‘ Institutes, and how they should be conducted,” ‘‘How to teach Eng- 
lish composition,” ‘‘ Study of the classics,” and “‘ English grammar.” The association 
adjourned to meet at Talladega, July 5, 6, and 7, 1883.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
These area State superintendent of pubfic instruction, elected for 2 years; a State board 
of commissioners of the common school fund; an examiner for each county, appointed by 
the county court; and elective boards of 3 district directors, 1 to be changed each year. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are supported from the income of a State school fund, a tax of $Lonmen 
over 21, with such other appropriations as the legislature may make, and optional dis- 
trict taxes, which may not exceed 5 mills on $1. Theapportionment of public funds is 
on the basis of resident youth 6 to 21. If imany district the public money, with the dis- 
trict taxes voted, should not suffice to sustain a school for 3 months, directors may deter- 
mine that no school shall be taught during such year. Reports of school statistics must 
be made annually by all school officers. The law forbids the use of sectarian books in 
public schools, commands the separate instruction of white and colored, and provides for 
teachers’ State certificates, valid during life, as well as for limited ones of 3 grades, and 
for teachers’ institutes, to be held by examiners in each county and by the State super- 
intendent in each judicial district, a

GENERAL CONDITION. 
An encouraging condition of public school affairs is reported. Prejudice against the 
system, engendered by unwise legislation and waste of school funds, was disappearing, 
and the people were coming to look on the public schools as the only means through 
which a large portion of the school population could obtain an education. The statistics, 
though imperfect and unsatisfactory, furnish abundant proof of progress. With but 
16,776 more youth of school age than the previous year, the stated increase in public 
school enrolment was 18,952, although only about half the school districts reported on this 
point. The superintendent thinks the real increase‘in attendance was about 40,000, or 
more than twice as great as the increase of youth to be educated. More money was ex- 
pended on the public schools. More teachers were employed, and the standard of qual- 
ification for them was raised; county examiners were more careful in granting certifi- 
cates, and the consequence was better teaching. Although the number of school-houses 
built was less than in 1880-81, those erected were better adapted to their purpose; many 
were more attractive in appearance and were supplied with improved furniture and ap- 
paratus. Several school districts had no schools during the year, preferring to use their 
funds to provide school-houses. The public schools in cities and towns were rapidly in- 
creasing in number and importance. Some of the more important towns failed to report, 
but spch reports as were received showed increased attendance on schools and larger 
expenditures for them. 
    
   
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF LITTLE ROCK. 
OFFICERS. 
A law of 1869 provides for the election of 6 directors for the supervision of city 
schools, the directors being authorized to employ a superintendent, who may also be 
principal of a graded or high school established by the board. 
STATISTICS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Little Rock had in 1880 a population of 13,138, and in 1882 reported 5,533 youth of 
school age, with 3,066 pupils in public schools and 1,742 in average attendance, a gain 
in enrolment of 428 over the previous year, with 2 more teachers. 
The public schools are classed as primary, grammar, and high, each comprising 4 
grades. The improvement effected during the year was as great as could be reasonably 
expected, considering the crowded condition of the lower grades. Two additional rooms 
were opened, making seats for 120 more pupils, but this is not sufficient, even for the 
present, and the school population is constantly increasing. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMALS. 
The State continues its training of teachers in a normal department belonging to 
the Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, and in a branch normal of the same at 
Pine Bluff, the former for white students, the latter for colored. Each of these schools 
in 1881~’82 offered 400 free scholarships, 63 more than the previous year, the university 
trustees having authority to decide as to the number. They are divided among the 
vounties according to population. Of the 400 open to white students, 385 were vacant 
in 1881-’82. The literary requirements for admission were not high, but they em- 
braced a thorough knowledge of the four fundamental rules of arithmetic, with decimal 
fractions, ability to read well in the fourth reader, a knowledge of primary. English 
grammar and geography, the rudiments of penmanship, and the ability to spell ordinary 
words of the grade of the fourth reader. The course of study, covering 4 years in both 
schools, in addition to instruction in the branches taught in the public schools, includes 
training in methods of imparting instruction, in organizing and governing schools, and in 
the legal duties of teachers. The school for white pupils reports 56 in normal studies; 
that for colored pupils, 40 during the year. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
By arrangement with the general agent of the Peabody fund, the State was entitled to 
8 Peabody scholarships in the Normal College of the University of Nashville, which 
scholarships are filled by appointment upon competitive examinations. 
Marianna College and Normal Institute, Marianna, reorganized September 15, 1882, under 
the supervision of the schoo] board of Marianna and partly sustained by the publieschool 
funds, offered tuition free to residents of the district, the principal being allowed to re- 
ceive paying pupils from outside. What normal training or normal students there were 
does not appear. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  12 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
During the year, too, a normal department was added to the public graded school 
system of Russellville. 
Normal instruction is given to colored students in Southland College and Normal Insti- 
tute, Helena, under the direction of Friends, which, besides 248 other pupils in 1882, 
reported 36 under training for teaching. : 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Twelve normal institutes were held in the several judicial districts under the personal 
supervision of State Superintende#t James L. Denton, assisted by Prof. O. F. Russell, 
whose salary and travelling expenses were paid out of an appropriation from the Pea- 
body fund. State Superintendent Pope says too nruch importance cannot be attached to 
these migratory schools for teaching teachers how to teach, but that the shortness of the 
sessions has prevented the attainment of the best results. According to a recent rule 
made by the agent of the Peabody fund, the sessions of all institutes aided by that fund 
must henceforth be longer. 
SCHOOL JOURNAL. 
The Arkansas School Journal, the official organ of the public school system, continued 
to be published at Little Rock, under the editorship of the late State Superintendent 
Denton, until the death of that officer in October, 1882. e 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In several of the principal cities and towns, public high schools formed a part of tle 
graded system in 1882. Little Rock, Bentonville, Searcy, Fort Smith, Russellville, and 
Lonoke had such schools and other towns were proposing toestablish them. Little Rock 
reports 2, one for white and one for colored youth, the average enrolment in the former 
being 69; in the latter, 20. There were 1,453 in the State studying the higher branches, 
a slight decrease during the year. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges and universities, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and fora 
summary, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Four out of 5 collegiate institutions in this State reported statistics for 1881-82, viz: 
The Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville; Arkansas College, Batesville; Cane 
Hill College, Boonsboro’; and Judson University, Judsonia. All these were open to both 
sexes, as was also St. John’s College, Little Rock, at last accounts; but no report from it 
has come since 1879. 
The latest catalogues received from the 5 colleges show that all had preparatory and 
classical and that 3, the Arkansas College, Judson University, and St. John’s College, 
had scientific and commercial courses; that all except Arkansas College report provision 
for instruction in music; that Cane Hill College offered a ladies’ course of 3 years, and that 
the State University and St. John’s College madesome provision for the training of teachers. 
The whole number of young women availing themselves of the privileges offered them 
aoes not appear. Only the two universities distinguish as to the sex of students, the 
State University having 17 young women in the regular collegiate classes and Judson 
University 62 in all departments. None, except the State University, reports the number 
belonging to the collegiate classes. In Arkansas College, no special lines are drawn be- 
tween classes; there is only a prescribed course for degrees, which may be completed in 
more or less time, according to the ability and industry of students. In Judson Univer- 
sity and St. John’s College also class distinctions were not obseryed, the courses being 
arranged in independent schools. 
The Arkansas Industrial University offers nine courses of study: classical, Latin letters, 
modern languages, English, normal, and 4 scientific courses. A preparatory department 
gives the necessary training for admission, which in Latin includes only a mastery of 
the principles of the grammar and two books of Czesar’s Commentaries. Military in- 
struction forms a part of the course for young men, and a department of music afiords 
opportunity for thorough drill during the four yearsin vocal and instrumental music, 
including piano and violin. Evidences of substantial progress during the last few years 
were found in more students and teachers, more buildings, an extended curriculum, and 
more exacting standard. The averageannual attendance during the last four years was 
426, against 256 in 1877~’78, although the enrolment during the last year fell considerably 
below the average forthe four, owing to various transientgauses. . Thenumber of professor-

ships increased, during the same period, from 11to 16. The State superintendent says the 
influence of the university has begun to be felt. Some of the graduates had obtained pro- 
fessorships, three or four were elected to the legislature, and many had turned their 
attention: to teaching. 
In addition to previous ones, three colleges —one for whites and two for blacks—seem 
to have begun at Little Rock in 1881-’82. The college for whites, Little Rock Univer- 
sity, under Methodist influences, secured thirteen acres of land in the city and began its 
instruction in the fall of 1882. The institutions for blacks, Philander Smith College 
(Methodist Episcopal) and Edward Smith College (Congregational), took the prelimi- 
steps towards organization by securing sites and preparing to build. The site for 
the last included fourteen acres, overlooking the city, purchased and fenced through funds 
furnished by Mr. Edward Smith, of Enfield, Mass. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Provision for scientific instruction is made, as already noted, by the Arkansas Indus- 
trial University in 4 distinct courses, all extending over 4 years, one being in general 
science, one in agriculture, and one each in civil and mining engineering. These courses 
are nearly identical during the first and second years, the principal differences being in 
the last two years. Students receive the degrees of civil engineer, mining engineer, and 
bachelor of agriculture on completion of the corresponding courses. There is a small 
farm connected with the institution, on which labor is paid for at 8 to 10 cents an hour. 
* Cane Hill College, Boonsboro’, presents a department of engineering, with a course 
extending over 4 years, while at St. John’s College, Little Rock, and Judson University, 
Judsonia, general scientific courses are outlined. 
» PROFESSIONAL. 
The medical department of the Arkansas Industrial University, organized in 1879-’80, 
reports its third annual course of lectures commenced October 5, 1881, and continued 5 
months. There were 36 regular matriculates, 5 of whom were graduated. Among the 
requirements for graduation are 3 years’ study of medicine, including attendance on 2 
courses of lectures of 20 weeks each, and a satisfactory examination ou the studies of the 
course, 
There is no information of any other institution or department for professional in- 
struction in the State, although it appears that there were 3 students of theology in 
Judson University, Judsonia, during 1881-’82. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Arkansas Deaf-Mute Institute, Little Rock, is for the free instruction of children 
too deaf to be taught in the common schools. Pupils from 9 to 30 are received and may 
remain 7 sessions of 9 months each. Substantial improvements had been made in the 
erection of buildings and the introduction of trades. Printing, shoemaking, agriculture, 
housekeeping, and dressmaking are now taught, besides the common school branches. 
Attendance during the last 4 years has varied from 57 to '76. A proper appreciation of 
educational advantages would, it was believed, bring it up to 150 or 175, for there were 
on the books of the institute the names of 250 mutes, residents of the State, of proper 
age to be in school.— (Report of principal in State report.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Arkansas School for the Blind, Little Rock, gives instruction in all the branches 
of a good English education, besides training in music and in various handicrafts, with 
the hope of making many of them self-sustaining. The institute is reported as prosper- 
ing in its work, notwithstanding want of room, limited means, and other drawbacks. 
During the two years ended September 30, 1882, more new pupils were ‘admitted than 
ever before for the same length of time, the whole number under instruction reaching 67. 
The great want was more room.— (Report of superintendent in State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ARKANSAS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Hot Springs, June 
20-22, 1882. President C. P. Conrad, in his opening address, touched on the educational 
progress made recently in the State and spoke of the necessity existing in the South for

aid from the General Government in the maintenance of schools. The second day came 
a paper on ‘‘ What ought parents to do for their children?’ one on the ‘‘ Necessity of 
primary education,’’ and one on ‘‘Make the children talk.’’ All gave evidence of seri- 
ous thought and were discussed at length by members of the association. In the after- 
noon papers were presented on ‘‘A graded course of study for the primary and preparatory 
schools of Arkansas,’’ on the ‘‘Relation of the public schools to higher schools,’” and on 
“The Bible’s place in our schools.’? In the evening a letter from Hon. J. L. Denton 
was read, expressing regret at his inability to be present and occupy his place on the 
rogramme, and a paper by H. C. Hammond on ‘‘Compulsory education’? was discussed 
at some length. The subjects on the third day were ‘‘ What are correct habits of study 
and how can we form them in our pupils?’’ ‘‘ The profession of teaching: how can it be. 
made more attractive, remunerative, and prominent?’ ‘‘ Expositions for our schools,” 
“The county examiner: his duties and responsibilities,’ ‘‘Natural sciences,’’ ‘‘ Elocu- 
tion,” and ‘‘ Value of teachers’ meetings.’’ 
Among the resolutions adopted was one that in future each member who reads a paper 
before the association shall append to it such resolutions as shall call out the action of 
the body; another made it the duty of the executive committee to represent the pub- 
lic school interests before the legislature of the State and to memorialize Congress in 
regard to an appropriation in aid of public education in the Southern States; and still 
another called for the passage of a compulsory education law to secure the attendance of 
every child between 6 and 14 for at least 4 months of the year. The association also 
expressed approval of educational exhibitions and appointed a standing committee to 
make arrangements for them. } 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
J. L. DENTON. | 
James L. Denton, late State superintendent of public instruction of Arkansas, was born 
in Johnson County, Arkansas, July 6, 1836. While still young he showed a great fond- 
ness for reading and for public speaking. The foundation of his education was laid in 
the country schools and academies of Washington County. At the age of 18 he taught 
school in that county and in Benton. Before attaining the age of 20 he was licensed to 
preach, and soon afterward was admitted to the conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South, and appointed to the Clarksville circuit. In 1857 he was elected chap- 
lain of the lower house of the State legislature. In 1858 he was stationed at Van 
Buren, and, in addition to his ministerial duties, assisted in teaching in the Wallace In- 
stitute, and continued his studies in the ancient languages at the same time. In 1859, 
he was stationed at Helena, where he remained until driven out by the Federal forces in 
1862. In 1869 Mr. Denton was stationed at Little Rock, but was recalled to Helena in 
1870, where he remained in charge of the same congregation for four years, after which 
he became interested in the insurance business, which he conducted for seven years. 
He was one of the ablest pulpit orators of the South. His sermons were practical, 
forcible, and inspiring, and always attracted large audiences. 
In the fall of 1878 Mr. Denton was elected State superintendent of public instrue- 
tion, and entered upon the duties of his office November2. Besides attending to the de- 
tails of office work, he delivered stirring addresses on education in the towns and vil- 
Jages, awakening public sentiment on the subject to an unusual degree. He then held 
a series of normal institutes, which served the double purpose of giving instruction and 
new energy to teachers and people and of strengthening the school system. He was en- 
gaged in this work at the time of his death, October 9, 1882, having been reélected with- 
out opposition in 1880. 
It would be but an indifferent comment on the earnest and devoted labors of this su- 
perintendent to say that he faithfully discharged the duties of his office. He assumed 
duties and responsibilities not imposed on him by law and gave all his time and ener- 
gies to the work of building up the school interests of the State. Active and energetic, 
he devoted all his powers to the cause of popular education, creating in every part of the 
State a new interest in it, which was followed by better schools and by a general desire 
to be in harmony with the progressive spirit of the age.

  16 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State there are a board of education of three members and aState superintend- 
ent of public instruction, whois its secretary; for each county, a superintendent of public 
schools and a board of education for the examination of teachers, prescribing of text 
books, &c.; for cities, hoards of education, with generally a superintendent of city schools 
and a city board of examination; for each school district not otherwise provided for, a 
board of 3 trustees, chosen at first for 1, 2, and 3 years, and subsequently one each year 
or 3 years. ‘The State and county superintendents hold for 4 years. Women are eli- 
gible to school offices. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State system provides for a free school to be supported in each district at least six 
months in every year after the first year in which a school has been established. It in- 
cludes primary and grammar schools and such high schools, evening, normal, and tech- 
nical schools as may be established, but the entire revenue from the State school fund 
and the State school tax must be applied exclusively to the support of primary and 
grammar schools. Local boards and county superintendents of counties which may not 
have county boards of education adopt text books, to continue in use not less than four 
years, and also examine teachers for certificates. 
Sectarian doctrine may not be taught in the public schools and no public money may 
be apportioned to any school district, town, or city in which denominational or sectarian 
doctrine is taught in any of the public schools. Teachers must be eighteen years of age 
and must have a certificate of qualification before assuming charge of a public school. 
In cities having graded schools beginners must be taught for the first two years by 
teachers who have had at least four years’ experience, and such teachers rank in point 
of salary with those of first grade. Instruction must be given in manners and morals, 
in patriotism and good citizenship. The school day is of six hours; the school month, of 
twenty days. The public schools are sustained from the proceeds of a State poll tax of 
$2 on each male inhabitant over 21 and under 60 years of age, except paupers, &c., to 
be used for paying teachers; a county tax, not to exceed 50 cents on $100; and a dis- 
trict tax, not to exceed 70 cents on $100 for building or 30 cents on $100 for other school 
purposes. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The report of the State superintendent of public instruction indicates a decided ad- 
ance in the public schools during 1881—’82, as will be seen from the statistical summary. 
Among evidences of progress is the fact that a large majority of the district school- 
houses were supplied with ample accommodations for the pupils, had good ventilation, 
&c., and were generally surrounded by suflicient grounds. There was a decided im- 
provement in the force of teachers, the number holding first grade county certificates 
having increased from 1,816 to 2,115. In other points there was a slight decrease : 3 
fewer school-houses built, 42 fewer men teaching, and 26 cents less in the average 
monthly pay of women. 
Superintendent Campbell says that, though highly satisfactory, the advance still falls 
short of the reasonable requirements and expectations of the people who furnish the 
means for carrying on the work of free public education. After visiting sixty-nine 
county teachers’ institutes and conferring with teachers and hearing them discuss the 
educational problems of the day, the superintendent of the State says that, taken as a 
whole, the teachers of California are a body of earnest, thoughtful, educated men and 
women, doing good and thorough work. He strongly advocates a return to State uni- 
formity in. text books and urges that the legislature submit to a vote of the people an 
amendment to the constitution embodying this change. His only objection to the 
present system is the great variety of books upon the same subject, imposing heavy ex- 
pense upon parents who remove from one district to another. The change retards the 
progress of the children of such families and is a source of embarrassment to teachers 
taking charge of new schools. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
The school officers of each city are a board of education, a board of examination, and 
superintendent of public schools. Each city having over 30,000 inhabitants is allowed 
a deputy superintendent.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. * 
Los Angeles city schools had, as above shown, 43 teachers, the rapid growth of the city 
requiring the employment of eight more than in the previous year. Three school- 
houses were built, and, still lacking room, the board rented seven rooms for the city 
high school and three primary classes. The grades appear to have embraced, as before, 
5 primary, 3 grammar, and 4 high school divisions, covering 12 years. A commercial 
course, apparently of 2 terms, is also offered. 
Oukiand shows by a return the continuation of its graded system of schools (which em- 
braced primary, grammar, and high) in 16 buildings, with sittings for 6,347 children. 
Music and drawing still entered into the instruction given, there being special teachers 
of these branches. The evening school before reported was also continued, with 1 teacher. 
The estimated enrolment in private and church schools increased 239. For the only fur- 
ther information available, see Secondary Instruction, page 18. 
Sacramento, according to the Rules and Regulations of the City Board of Education, in- 
cludes in its system some ungraded.schools, with the usual primary, grammar, and high 
schools. The last three cover 11 years, 4 each in the primary and grammar grades and. 
3inthehigh. Evening schools are also provided for, to afford the means of an elementary 
_ English education to boys and girls that cannot attend the day schools, as well as to 
adults who may wish to avail themselves of this means of remedying past neglect of train- 
ing. Beyond this there is no information for the year. 
San Francisco, with 765 more census children, shows an increase of 565 in public school 
pupils; a per cent. of attendance on the average number belonging higher than for two 
preceding years; an increase of 343 in the average daily attendance in all the public 
schools; and yet 14,189 children of school age that had not attended school at any time 
during the year, an increase of 1,216. This number did not include Chinese. In addi- 
tion to the ordinary English studies, German was taught in two primary schools; French 
and German, in two grammar schools; and French, in the Boys’ High School. Twenty 
substitute teachers and one teacher of music were employed. One school-house was 
built, at a cost of $4,449, while four rooms were added to another school. Evening schools 
were growing in favor and were reported to be the most useful and prosperous schools 
in the city. There were 3 such schools, with 905 young men and women in attendance, 
under the instruction of 21 teachers. Classification and promotions occur at the end of 
each term and as nearly as practicable the same course of study is pursued as in the day 
schools. The valuation of school property in San Francisco was $3,137,000, including 
$12,000, value of school libraries. ‘The enrolment in schools other than public was 5,912. 
San José shows a decrease in the city population, in children of school age, in enrolment 
in public schools, in average attendance, and in number of teachers, but a slight increase 
in the school expenditure wasnoted. The estimated enrolment in private and parochial 
schools was 600. 
Stockton presents an increase of 106 in children of school age, of 51 in enrolment in 
public schools, and of 64 in average daily attendance, with the same number of teachers. 
‘There was a decrease of $6,622 in school expenditure. There were 246 pupils enrolled 
in private and parochial schools. Estimated value of school property, $145,137. There 
were four grades in the primary and twoin the grammar schools; the studies of the high 
school occupy three years, with business, normal, literary, classical, and scientific, be- 
sides graduate, courses. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The attendance on this school, located at San José, had increased about 60 per cent. 
in the years 1880-81 and 1881-82. Out of 216 applicants for admission, 177 succeeded 
25
-P-A-G-E-312
      
18 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in entering. The highest number present at one time was 532. The average attendance 
for the term, exclusive of the training school, was 506, and the average daily attend- 
ance 495. A well organized training school is connected with the normal school and in 
this the pupil teachers find opportunity to apply practically the instruction received in 
methods of teaching. The legislature appropriated $100,000 to rebuild the normal 
school building destroyed by fire in 1880. This, with the $50,000 insurance on the former 
building, was deemed sufficient, and the cost not only came within the appropriation 
but left a margin of $1,063, which the trustces returned to the State treasury. 
A building for a branch State normal school was erected at Los Angeles in 1882. Out: 
of 82 applicants, 64 were admitted; 19 more afterwards entered, making a total of 83. 
A training school was organized, numbering 145 pupils, divided into three classes, Whose 
teachers were graduates of the San José Normal School. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The normal department connected with the Girls’ High School at San Francisco was 
established in 1876 and since that time has graduated 374 pupils. By resolution of the 
board, June, 1882, this department was restricted to one class of 50 pupils; the gradu- 
ates now teceive only second class certificates.. Mr. Swett, the principal, strongly urges 
the erection of a building for the normal school. 
Normal classes are formed towards the close of the collegiate course each year in Pietee 
Christian College, College City, and Hesperian College, Woodland, while the normal 
class in Pacific Methodist College, Santa Rosa, constitutes a regular department of the in- 
stitution. 
At San Francisco there were in 1881-82 at least two Kindergarten normal schools, one 
under Miss Emma Marwedel, the pioneer in Kindergarten training on the Pacific Coast; 
the other under Mrs. Kate Wiggin, one of her gradtiates. The former had between 40 
and_50 pupils in Kindergarten and primaty departments, under 4 instructors, and gradu- 
ated 15; the latter, not reporting the number of students in 1881~’82, graduated 15, all of 
whom engaged in teaching. Drawing and vocal music were taught in both schools, and 
that of Miss Marwedel had a gymnasium and a museum of natural history. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Superintendent Canrpbell states that teachers’ institutes have been held in most of the 
counties of the State and have been productive of mueh good, not only to the teachers, 
put, through them, to the schools, and have awakened in the community a more lively 
interest in the public schools and in the cause of education generally. The number of 
institutes held during the year was 48; number of teachers attending, 3,298. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
The State board of education in 1877 designated as the official organ of the school 
depattment The Pacifie School Jourial, edited by Mr. Albert Lyser. It has sitice con- 
tinued to be an important thedium of educational information, not only for California, 
put for all the Pacific Slope. 
The nee California Teacher is tinderstood to have been since adopted as the organ of 
the board.   
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report shows an enrolment in 1881-'82 of 3,848 in high schools, but does not 
give the number of such schools. 
San Francisco had 2. The one for boys had an enrolment of 327, of whom 34 gradu- 
ated; while the girls’ school had 930 and graduated 170. The total number in both 
schools, 1,257, was an increase of 82. 
The number of pupils in the high school at Oakland was 296 and the graduates 24, 
7 men and 17 women. The San José high school graduated 12 young ladies. 
Stockton high school, numbering 99 students, at the last exercises graduated 14, 9 
young ladies and 5 young men, 
Thé Pacific School Journal shows the existence of a high school in Los Angeles, which 
graduated a class of 23 in June and was to be transferred to the new normal school 
building in the autumn. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private acatlemic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of 
the appendix following, and the summaries thereof in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. Besides the separate business colleges, a number of the colleges in Table LX 
have either commercial departments or arrangements for instruction preparatory to a com- 
mercial life.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of California, Berkeley, continued its departments of instruction, com- 
prising the college of letters, which includes the customary classical course, while scien- 
tific studies were presented in the colleges of agriculture, mechanics, mining, ¢ivil en- 
gineering, and chemistry. There were in addition a literary course, a coutse in letters 
and science, and certain itregular courses, besides professional courses, noticed elsewhere. 
The general funds of the university are devoted to the colleges of letters and science. 
The undergraduate colleges of letters, agriculture, mining, mechanics, civil engineer- 
ing, and chemistry were the only ones included in the original organization in 1868. The 
professional colleges have since been added. State students receive free tuition. Those 
from other States are admitted to equal privileges on the payment of a small fee. All 
courses are open to both sexes without distinction. In both the scientific and literary 
colleges German, French, and Anglo-Saxon enter into the courses of the freshman and 
sophomore years. Provision is also made for the optional study of Spanish, Hebrew, 
Chaldaic, and Syriac. Latin up to 4 books of Cesar, 6 orations of Cicero, and 6 books of 
Virgil and Greek up to 4 books of Xenophon and 2 of Homer are required for entering the 
classical course. The total number of students in 1881-’82 in the college of letters was 
142, including 3 graduate students. : 
The number of other colleges continued to be twelve, California College, at Vacaville, 
suspended in 1881, not reporting and supposed to be still closed, and the College of Our 
Lady of Guadalupe returning to the list, but with uncertainty yet as to its collegiate 
standing. Five of the above colleges were under Roman Catholic influence, 3 under 
Methodist Episcopal, 2 under Christian, 1 under Protestant Episcopal, and 1 non-secta- 
-rian. Nearly all gave courses of fair standard and of four years’ duration in their clas- 
sical departments, with three or four years in the scientific and two or three in the pre- 
paratory departments. All gave instruction in music and modern languages. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Opportunity for the higher instruction of women was found in seven of the above named 
colleges and returns show 3 institutions designed for this sex alone: the Young Ladies’ 
Seminary, at Benicia, with 12 professors and teachers; Mills Seminary, at Mills Semi- 
nary P. O., with 16 instructors; and the College of Notre Dame, San José. Music was 
taught in all these; also, French, German, and Spanish. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of California continued its scientific courses of four years each in the 
colleges of agriculture, mechanics, mining, civil engineering, and chemistry. In addi- 
tion to these 4-year courses, the colleges of mechanics and mining had graduate courses, 
where advanced instruction was given in such studies as were necessary for the profes- 
sional degree. f 
Upon recommendation of the faculty a diploma from the university entitled the holder 
to a teacher’s certificate, The University of the Pacific gave a 3-year Latin-scientific 
course, 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The only distinctively theological schools in 1881-’82 were the two that have been re- 
ported in preceding years: (1) The Pacific Theological Seminary, Oakland (Congrega- 
tional), with a 3-year course of study and a preliminary examination of candidates for 
admission that do not present evidence of sufficient scholastic preparation, and (2) the San 
Francisco Theological Seminary, San Francisco (Presbyterian), with the same length of 
course and the same ruleas to examination. Some theological instruction was also given 
at the Franciscan College, Santa, Barbara (Roman Catholic), at Pierce Christian College, 
College City, and at Hesperian College, Woodland (both Christian). In the University 
of Southern California, Los Angeles (Methodist Episcopal), students preparing for the 
ministry were offered instruction in Hebrew and in historical and systematic theology. 
During the year under review the Pacific Theological Seminary received $56,000 for 
endowment, Mr. Moses Hopkins, of San Francisco, giving $50,000, and Mrs. Whitin, of 
Whitinsville, Mass., $5,000 of this amount, while 944 volumes were given the library 
by the sons of the late Dr. E. Pond, of Bangor, Me. Five students were graduated from 
the seminary, two more than in any previous year. 
For legal instruction the Hastings College of the Law, San Francisco (the law school of 
the University of California), continued in 1881-82 to require from candidates for its 
3-year course of 40 weeks yearly preliminary evidence of literary training sufficient to

warrant their admission. It also required, as before, an examination at the close of the 
first and second years for an advance to the class of the succeeding year, as well as a final 
examination for graduation. Moot courts were held for the argument of causes and the 
discussion of legal questions. Instructors for the year, 4; students, 136. 
For study in medicine, the medical department of the University of California, San 
Francisco, provided a 3-year graded course, with 20 weeks in each year (attendance on 
the preliminary or spring term of 12 weeks not being compulsory), and examinations at 
the end of the first and second years for promotion and final examination. Thecourse of 
studies comprises clinical, didactic, and laboratory teaching, with dissections. Cooper 
Medical College (originally the medical department of the University of the Pacific) also 
gave a 3-year course of 20 weeks in the regular term each year, with annual examinations 
asabove and apreliminary examination. The California Medical College (eclectic), Oak- 
land, offered and recommended a 3-term graded course of instruction and required for 
graduation a course covering 2 years of at least 24 weeks each. The Woman’s Medical 
College of the Pacific Coastopened in 1881, with a course of 20 weeks each year, has 
thus far sent no further information of itself or of its work. 
The dental department of the University of California, San Francisco (organized 1881, 
opened 1882), required for graduation two full lecture courses of 20 weeks each, a satis- 
_ factory final examination, a thesis, and approved cases of operative and mechanical den- 
tistry. There is no preliminary examination till 1883; then it is to be required of all 
except such as present evidence of graduation from a high school or college. 
California College of Pharmacy, San Francisco (a branch of the University of California), 
requires 4 years of pharmacal service, three and a half of these before graduation, with 
attendance on two full courses of lectures. Besides examination and additional profes- 
sional service, there must be a joint recommendation from the faculty and the examining 
board before a diploma will be conferred. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The California Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Berkeley, still con- 
tinuedits useful work. The increase of pupils indicated ahealthy growth. The number 
on the rolls June 30, 1880, was 128, which had increased to 136 June 30, 1882, while 9 
more were admitted during the year. The teaching force of the institution consists of 
the principal, 7 teachers of the deaf and dumb, a teacher of articulation and one of draw- 
ing, 2 teachers for the blind, and a teacherof music. The course of study embraces what 
is usually taught in the common and high schools of the State, and a limited number were 
prepared for college. Two deaf-mutes were in the university at the date of the report 
and held good positions in their respective classes. A new school-house was erected dur- 
ing the year, which combined the requisites of light, heat, space, ventilation, and facility 
of exit. 
EDUCATION OF THE CHINESE. 
The American Missionary Association reports 15 schools for the education of the Chinese, 
with a total enrolment of 2,567 pupils, an increase of 935 over the preceding year. At 
the close of the year there were 31 teachers, 11 of whom were Chinese. Eleven of these 
schools were sustained during the entire year. The Mission Home at San Francisco, 
under the auspices of the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society (Presbyterian), had in 
1882 an enrolment of 39 young women and girls, who were taught housekeeping, clean- 
liness and order, writing, reading, &c. There had been admitted to the home in the 10 
years of its existence 129 women and girls. Two Sunday schools and one evening school 
were organized under the same influence, the former instructing 150 pupils; the latter, 
140, of whom 60 were boys under 17. Another mission school at San Francisco, con- 
ducted by the same society, had 125 pupils, of whom 20 to 30 were boys. The Women’s 
Foreign Missionary Society also had classes at Oakland, San José, and other cities. The 
Mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in 1868, had schools in San Fran- 
cisco, San José, Oakland, Sacramento, and Chico. Schools, 5; teachers, 13, with 890 
pupils and an average attendance of 188. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANED AND ABANDONED CHILDREN.           There were 21 institutions for the care and maintenance of minor orphans, half orphans, 
and abandoned children, receiving aid from the State to the amount of $190,486. No 
child is entitled to aid from this fund who is over 14. The course of study embraced 
the usual branches, with some instruction in morals and religion. ‘The girls were taught 
plain and ornamental needlework, &e.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association held its sixteenth annual session in San Francisco, 
December 27-29, 1882, President J. B. McChesney in the chair. The meeting is said to 
have been one of the most interesting and valuable ever held. There were present nearly 
170 members, including a large proportion of the representative educators of the State. 
President McChesney read an interesting address, devoted to the discussion of the func- 
tions of professional organizations like this association. Superintendent J. L. Shearer, 
of Napa, presented an able paper on ‘‘ Our school work.’’ Papers were read during the 
session by Professor Cook, of the State University, on ‘‘ English in our public schools;”? by 
Mrs. 8. B. Cooper, on the question ‘‘Shall the Kindergarten be a part of the public 
school system of the State;’’ by Ex-Superintendent Mann, on “Arnold of Rugby;’’ and 
by Prof. Ira Moore, on ‘‘ Graded schools.’’ An address on ,‘ Physical, intellectual, and 
moral training” was made by State Superintendent Welcfer, and there were also ad- 
dresses by Governor Stoneman and Superintendent Campbell. 
‘The discussions formed one of the important features of the meeting and general in- 
terest was manifested in all the proceedings. The subjects under discussion were “‘A 
proper course of study for our schools,’’ ‘‘ Free text books,” ‘State publication of text 
books,”? and ‘‘Home and school study.”” A committee on spelling reform was an- 
nounced by the president, and was instructed to report at the nextannual convention. 
William White, of San Francisco, was elected president for the ensuing year. 
SUPERINTENDENTS’ MEETING. 
‘The second Biennial Convention of County School Superintendents of California was 
-* held in San Francisco December 27, 1882, State Superintendent Campbell presiding. 
Albert Lyser, editor of the PacificSchool Journal, was chosen secretary. Thirty counties 
were represented during the entiresession. A large amount of work was done and many 
subjects were discussed; much time was given to the subject “Should the State print its 
text books and should it furnish them free?’’ the report of a committee of five on this 
subject being in the negative. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
MRS. MARY ATKINS LYNCH. 
Born in Jefferson, Ohio, July 7, 1819, Mary Atkins studied in the public schools and 
academies of theState. In 1835 she became a teacherin the public schools of New York. 
Six years later she entered Oberlin College, graduating with distinction four years after- 
ward and becoming assistant principal of the ladies’ department of the college; the fol- 
lowing year she was principal of the girls’ high school at Columbus, and then of the 
Woodward high school, Cincinnati, remaining till 1854. Called to the head of the Be- 
nicia Seminary for Young Ladies, Cal., which had been organized two years before, she 
infused her vigor and energy into the school, and for eleven years so managed it as to 
make it the leading seminary for young ladies on the Pacific coast. Disposing of her 
interest in the school she spent a few years in travel, to restore her impaired health, and 
then, at the instance of Superintendent Rickoff, resumed work, this time in the Cleve- 
land (Ohio) high school. In 1869 she was married to Mr. John Lynch, of Louisiana, 
going back in 1877 to the Benicia School, with which she had been so honorably identi- 
fied. She died September 14, 1882. 
CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER. 
Hon. FREDERICK M, CAMPEELL, State superintendent of public instruction, Sacramento, 
{Term, January 5,1830, to January 8, 1883.] 
‘This term was one year shorter than the regular time, because of a requirement to that effect in the constitution of 1879, which shortened by so much the terms of all officers chosen at the first elec tion under it, that subsequent elections might come in the years ofeyen numbers, 
In November, 1882, William T, Welcker was chosen to succeed Mr. Campbell.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
These are (1) a State board of education; (2) a State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion; (3) a superintendent of public schools for each county; (4) district boards of 3 or 6 
directors, according to population; (5) a committee of 3, with the county superintendent

as president, for any union high school formed by uniting districts to establish one; (6) 
aboard of 6 regents of the State University; and (7) a board of 4 commissioners of 
public lands. Women are eligible to district offices.— (Constitution and school law.) 
\ OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained from the income of a State fund and a county tax of 
2 to 5 mills on the dollar. An additional district tax may be levied for school buildings 
and furniture, and another, not to exceed one-tenth of a mill on the dollar, for the pur- 
chase of a school library. The public schools, except the high schools, are to be open at 
least 3 months in each year for the instruction of youth 6-21 residing in the districts, 
the district board having power to admit others, if thought best. Instruction must be 
given in English, though German or Spanish may be taught when demanded by the 
parents or guardians of 20 or more pupils attending any schoo!. The distriet hoard must 
employ teachers, fix the course of study and the exercises and text books to be used, 
procure books for indigent children, require all pupils to be furnished with the books 
preseribed, exclude from school and school library all reading of a sectarian character, 
and require teachers to conform to the laws. School funds are apportioned according to 
the youth of school age in each district; and a school to receive its share must have 
been taught by a duly licensed teacher 60 school days. The constitution forbids secta- 
rian instruction in the State schools, as well as a distinction or classification of pupils 
by race or color. Teachers must have certificates of qualification, and, besides the ordi- 
nary one, the State board issues certificates, good throughout the State, to teachers of two 
years’ experience who are highly qualified. The public schools are organized as graded 
and ungraded, the graded having high school courses, open to all.— (School law.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The year ending August, 1882, presents a large increase of school population and cor- 
ieepcoting work on the partof State school officers. During two years the school youth 
increased 13,642, and in the last year 8,404, To provide schools for these there 
were organized during the two years 97 new districts, 57 of them in 1881-82; 78 new 
school-houses were provided and furnished, affording 9,910 additional sittings and 
increasing the value of school property $553,081, of which $258,278 were for the last 
year; 222 more teachers were employed, 99 of them the increase of the last year. Only 
2,471 of the school population in 1882 could neither read nor write. The State super- 
intendent speaks of this growing and organizing period as of great importance, though 
attended with the danger of giving more attention to securing school privileges than to 
having these of the best quality; still, he reports a steady improvement in%he quality 
of the schools as well as an increase in number. In all the other items the statistics 
show a corresponding increase. Schools were taught an average of 100 days. The ex- 
cellent school system of the State is ascribed to the character"and intelligence of the 
people, a large per cent. of whom, from’ the earliest settlement of the State, have come 
from the best educational centres of the East.— (State report. ) 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN CITIES OF 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Denver and Leadville have school boards of 6 directors, elected by the people for 3 
years, with annual change of 2, each board appointing a superintendent of schools.—

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Denver reports only the statistics of district No. 1, including five-sixths of the city, 
there being also one ward west of Cherry Creek and a district beyond the Platte, in each 
of which there was an independent school authority, making ample provision for public 
instruction. Enrolment and average attendance were greater in 1881-’82 than in any 
preceding year. >

  24 REPORT. OF THE COMMISSICNER OF EDUCATION. 
Hon..J. D- Philbrick, long the superintendent of schools in Boston, Mass., speaks as 
follows of the Denver schools, which he visited in the spring of 1882: 
“Tn the latter part of April I made a thorough inspection of the school system of 
Denver, especially the division constituting the first district, which comprises the bulk 
of the schools. In the first place the school-houses were visited while occupied by the 
pupils, and their qualities, mechanical, economic, hygienic, and pedagogical, noted in 
detail. Superintendent Gove then, with documents in hand, went over to me, at great 
length, the organization and practical management of the system with respect to admin- 
istration, supervision, instruction, and discipline. , Thus instructed I applied myseli’ to 
the inspection and examination of the classes in the school rooms, beginning with the 
lowest primary and ending with the graduating class of the high school, in the hands of 
Mr. Principal Baker. In this survey I observed carefully the methods of teachers, the 
proficiency of the pupils, and the spirit in which teachers and pupils were working for the 
endsin view. Finally, I had the privilege of meeting the teachers in a body and conversing 
with a considerable number of them. 
“In the progress of this study of the system I could not but be impressed with the 
accumulating evidence of its efficiency and excellence. The result may be summed up by 
saying that I found the Denver school system to be admirable in all respects. Although 
its origin dates back scarcely more than a decade, its development has been so wisely and 
energetically conducted that already it fairly belongs to the front rank of city systems. 
It is pretty safe to say that the creation of a system of schools on so large a scale, of such 
exceptional merits, and in so brief a space of time, is a phenomenon to which the history 
of education affords no parallel.’’ a 
Leadville is as remarkable for its progress in education as for its growth in material 
prosperity. Its public schools, begun in 1878, are primary, with 2 grades of a year each; 
intermediate, with 4 grades; grammar, with 3; and a high school of 4grades. For these 
there were 4 school buildings, 2 of brick, costing with their furniture $102,000, and 2 of 
frame, costing $11,000. The buildings contained 22 schools, with 1,500 sittings, and 
were valued at $150,000. To provide for the rapidly increasing school population 2 of 
these, 1 of brick and 1 of frame, were erected during the year. Of the school population 
in 1881~’82, 82 per cent. were in average attendance. There were 26 regular and 2 special 
teachers (of German and music) employed at an average monthly pay of $92.13; the 
superintendent received $150. The superintendent thinks the school system of Lead- 
ville so complete that it offers in its fourth year as good facilities for public education as 
any city of its size in the United States. 
« 
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The University of Colorado, Boulder, has a definite normal course of 3 years. Applicants 
for admission to it must be at least 16 years of age, must declare their intention to become 
teachers, and must pass a satisfactory preliminary examination in elementary English 
studies. There were 17 normal students in 1881-82. Three completed the normal course, 
2 of whom were teaching. 
Colorado College, Colorado Springs, had, at the last advices, a normal course of 4 years, 
requiring for admittance a satisfactory knéwledge of. the elementary English branches. 
It sends no report for 1881-’82. 
The University of Denver provides a special course of studies for those who wish to pre- 
pare for teaching in the public schools. 
Denver City has also a normal and training class, with examinations, for such as desire 
to teach in the city schools. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
No information has reached this Bureau regarding teachers’ institutes held during 
1881-’82, and probably there were none, owing to the reason mentioned in the Bureau 
report of 1880-81, viz, the great extent of territory in each county, and the consequent 
difficulty of gathering at any central point a sufficient number of teachers to make an 
institute successful, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Denver and Leadville in 1880-’81 were reported to have fair high school studies, the 
former having 3 courses, each of 4 years. The course at Leadville was also of 4 years. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
According to the information athand, there appear to be 4 church schools of academic 
rank,.2 of them, Jarvis Hall, for-boys, and Wolfe Hall, for girls (Protestant Episcopal), 
one.

at Denver; 1, St. Mary’s Convent Academy, for girls (Roman Catholic), also at Denver, 
and Trinidad Academy (Congregational), the last believed to be open to both sexes. 
Five other Roman Catholic schools in different parts of the State ‘are reported as acad- 
emies in Sadlier’s Roman Catholie Directory, but without such statement of courses as 
to indicate academic rank.— (Year books and Report for 1881.) 
For statistics of business colleges, private or church academic schools, preparatory 
schools, and preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of 
the appendix; for summaries of their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN AND FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Colorado, Boulder, is a part of the public school system of the State 
and is governed by a board of regents elected by the people. It aims to complete the 
work begun in the public schools by affording facilities for education in literature, sci- 
ence, and the arts. It has full preparatory courses of 3 years, leading to classical, scien- 
tific, and Latin-scientific courses of 4 years each, with special courses for students not 
candidates for graduation. The normal course has been already mentioned. Males and 
females are admitted on equal terms. 
At the close of 1881—’82 there were, in all departments, 113 students: 72 in preparatory 
classes, 18 in collegiate, 17 in normal, and 6 special students; 19 completed the prepar- 
atory, and 6 who completed the full classical course were graduated in June, -1882.— 
(Calendar and State report.) 
Colorado College, Colorado Springs (non-sectarian), has a preparatory, a classical col- 
legiate, and a normal course, each of 4 years, and one of undefined length in mining and. 
metallurgy. French and German are elective studies in the freshman and sophomore 
years, and Spanish in the junior year. There are also special linés of studies for such 
as cannot pursue full courses. Both sexes are admitted to all the courses. Two wings 
were added to the. college building; the property of the college was valued at $75,000. 
The metallurgical department was in operation and scientific work was made more effi- 
cient by the addition of suitable rooms and apparatus. 
The college held its first commencement in June, 1882, when two young men gradu- 
ated and President Tenney was formally inaugurated. 
The University of Denver (Methodist Episcopal) had, in 1881-’82, preparatory, classical 
collegiate, scientific, music, and mining engineering courses, each of 4 y medical 
course meant to cover 3 years, and normal and art courses not fully defined. There 
is also provision for commercial instruction when desired by 5 students. , Instruction is 
given in French, Italian, German, and Spanish. Both sexes are admitted.— (Calendar.) 
For statistics of 1881-82, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary :of such sta- 
tistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF ‘YOUNG WOMEN, 
Up to 1881~’82 no institution of full collegiate rank exclusively for females had been 
established, but the 3 above mentioned colleges admitted them on equal terms with 
inales. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of Colorado, Boulder, provides a scientific course. : The well arranged 
courses of the University of Denver lead to the degrees of bachelor of science and mining 
enginegr, while Colorado College limits its scientific instruction to mining and metal- 
lurgy. The State School of Mines, Golden, near Denver, works in the same direction 
through courses which in the first two years deal with the general elements of science and 
in the next two prepare especially for mining engineering, civil engineering, and metal- 
lurgy. The Colorado Agricultural College, Fort Collins, beginning also with general 
elements, branched from these in 1882, as previously, into studies relating to scientific 
agriculture: horticulture, botany, zodlogy, geology, and chemistry. A part of its teach- 
ing is also directed to preparation for practical mechanics, including the use of t6ols and 
materials, with the principles underlying the various trades. . All these institutions, ex- 
cept the State School of Mines, offer instruction preparatory, to the collegiate scientific 
courses presented. 
For statistics of these schools, see Tables IX and X of the appendix; for summaries of 
their statistics, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. ©

26 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction was given in 1881 by the Protestant Episcopalians in the Cathe- 
dral Theological School, in Denver, by 4 instructors, but apparently to only 4 students. 
The required course is 3 years.— (Protestant Episcopal Almanac: ) 
There was also some ecclesiastical instruction given under the auspices of the Roman 
ee Church, as 12 ecclesiastical students were reported in 1881-’82,— (Catholic Year 
Book. 
Medical.—The only medical course reported in 1881-’82 was offered by the College of 
Medicine of the University of Denver, with a faculty of 17 professors and instructors. 
This college followed in its instruction the graded course recommended by the American 
Medical Association, although the completion of that course, which embraced 3 annual 
lecture terms of 20 weeks each, had not yet been made obligatory. Applicants for admis- 
sion must pass an examination in the ordinary high school studies or give other evidence 
of fitness. The conditions of graduation were 3 years of study, attendance on two courses 
of 20 weeks, instruction in practical anatomy and chemistry during two sessions, the 
presentation of a medical thesis, and the passage of an examination before the faculty on 
the seyen principal branches of medical science,— (Calendar. ) 
« SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF MUTES AND THE BLIND. 
The Colorado Mute and Blind Institute, Colorado Springs, is a State institution, 
founded in 1874, with a course intended to cover’ years. The State report discloses the 
presence of no blind pupils, and as to mutes only states that during the year there had 
been 49 in attendance, under 3 teachers; that in the domestic department some of both 
sexes were employed in the printing office; and that some girls were taught fancy work, 
dressmaking, and general housekeeping.— (State report.) 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The University of Denver, in its College of Music and Art, presents a course of 4 years 
in music; also, one in painting, the length of which depends on the ability and diligence 
of the student. 
In 1881-82 there were in the former 49 students, under 2 instructors, and in the latter 
17, under 1 instructor. Both courses appear to be thorough.— (Calendar.) 
* REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Colorado State Industrial School, Golden, incorporated February, 1881, was opened 
in July, 1881. During the year additions were made to the buildings, and the grounds 
were graded and improved, mainly through the work of the boys. Beginning with 3 
boys, July 11, 1881, in November, 1882, there were 80 enrolled, most of them under 15 
yearsof age. Of those received, 48 were committed for incorrigibility; 53 had been habit- 
ually idle and only 9 regularly employed. The board of control reported the school 
under thorough discipline, with energy and good management manifest in every depart- 
ment. It is made a principal object to teach trades involving the use of tools, Within 
two years, it is thought, the school will be required to care for 250 boys and 60 girls,— 
(State report. ) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
COLORADO STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body held its eighth annual meeting at Pueblo, opening Wednesday, December 
27, 1882. For the first time in the history of the association the entire State was repre- 
sented, delegates appearing from every educational institution, including the colleges and 
universities. On Thursday the president, James S. McClung, of Pueblo, addressed the 
convention, and this address, as well as each paper read, was followed by a general dis- 
cussion, One read by Prof. Copeland, touching the work of teachers in the formation of 
character, led to much debate, Superintendent Gove held that there is no character worth 
having but Christian character, and earnestly objected to the least shadow of an inference 
that the schools of this country are not forming good character, saying that a purer, better, 
truer, and more noble body than our public school teachers does not exist. In the even- 
ing Prof, Paul Hanus, of the State University, gave a lecture on ‘‘Growth”’ to a large 
= After the election of officers, the association adjourned.— (Journal of Edu- 
cation.

educators of the State werepzesent. Committees were appointed to report courses for the 
different grades of schoois. The following resolutions were adopted: (1) Thatinall towns 
of sufficient size we deem it important that a 3-year high school course be established as 
soon as possible if not already in existence ; (2) that so far as practicable the course 
of study in the high schools of the State should meet the requirements for admission to 
the State University; (3) that we recognize the necessity of encouraging a uniform 
course in both the graded and ungraded schools of the State. The superintendent was 
instructed to have full reports of the committees printed in his report to the governor, 
giving the courses of study for each grade.— (State report. )

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State board of education of six members has general charge of the school system, 
For current work it appoints a secretary to serve during its pleasure as general superin- 
tendent, and also an agent to enjoin the observance of laws respecting the employment 
of children. ‘Towns choose boards of school visitors of 3 to 9 members, except where any 
have abolished their petty districts and been reconstructed as town districts; then they 
have school committees of 6, 9, or 12members. Districts that continue to be only parts of . 
towns have such committees of 3 members, save where they succeed former school societies; 
then they choose boards of education of 6 or 9 members. All these town and district 
school officers are liable to partial annual change.

CONNECTICUT. . 29 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. . 
Public schools must be taught for at least 30 weeks each year in every school dis- 
, trict in which the school population numbers 24 or more, and for at least 24 weeks in 
other places. All children 8 to 14, unless disqualified, must attend someschool at least 
3 months each year or be taught at home for an equal length of time, and such chil- 
dren may not be employed in any business unless they have been taught at least 60 days 
in the year preceding. School funds come from local taxation, the income of a State 
school fund and of town or district funds, and from a State appropriation of $1.50 for 
each child between 4 and 16, which ages are the basis of apportionment of all public 
school moneys. No district may receive its share unless schools have been taught therein 
the required length of time, nor unless an annual report has been made to the town board 
and satisfactory school accommodations are furnished. Towns neglecting to provide for 
support of schools forfeit to the State a sum equal to the amount which they were required 
by law to appropriate. Teachers must hold a certificate of qualification from the school 
authorities and must keep a register and report to school visitors, who, in turn, are 
required to report annually to the State board. The system comprises public school libra- 
ries, graded and high schools, a normal school, a reform school, and an industrial school 
for girls. Text books are furnished free of cost to pupils unable to pay for them. 
AMENDMENTS TO THE scHOoL LAW. * 
Among additions to the school law passed during the legislative session of 1882 are 
noted the following: Any town or school district failing to make the required annual 
returns of statistics by October 15 shall forfeit of the $1.50 State money for each census 
child 1 per cent. for the first week of such delay, 2 per cent. for 2 weeks, and 5 per 
cent. for four weeks, after which the loss is to be 10 per cent. The compulsory educa- 
tion law was modified by reducing the penalty for employing a child illegally from $100 
to $60 and by making each week’s failure on the part of parents to send their children to 
school a distinct offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $5. It was also made the 
duty of parents or others having control of children under 14 to furnish the employer 
of such children certificates from teacher, school visitor, or committee showing that the 
Jaw as to attendance has been complied with; and it was also made the duty of employers 
to keep such certificates at their place of business and exhibit them to the proper officers 
on demand. Parents making false statements or causing children to make them, with 
intent to evade the law, are to be fined not more than $7 or imprisoned not more than 
30 days. Members of district committees and janitors of school buildings were made 
eligible to appointment as special constables to arrest for truancy and certain other 
offences. School visitors are authorized, on petition of 12 adults, to order that instrue- 
tion be given in the public schools concerning the effects of intoxicating beverages on 
individuals and the community. If any persons feel aggrieved by such action, on petition 
of 20 legal voters the question must be submitted to the next annual town meeting, which 
has power to decide it for one year. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show that with 2,443 more children of school age 1,804 more were enrolled 
in publieschools; that there was a larger average attendance both in winter and summer, 
asmall increase in the average monthly pay of teachers, and $76,374 (or about 5 per cent.} 
more expended for public schools, almost two-fifths of this being for teachers’ wages. The 
sum raised by town and district taxes was 8 per cent. larger than the previous year and 
the receipts from all sources were $81,726 more, although a decline in the rate of interest 
on investments (with the increased enumeration) considerably diminished the amount 
per pupil received from the school fund. ' The secretary of the board of education con- 
siders that the increase in attendance about kept pace with that of school population, the 
number of school age reported as attending no school being slightly less than it was the 
previous year, although in regard to the latter he says there is always some uncertainty, 
for two reasons: first, reports from private schools are more or less imperfect, school 
officers having no authority to require them; second, the enumeration of school popula- 
tion is made on the Ist of January, while the reports of attendance cover the year ending 
with August. Thatso large a proportion of the children between 8 and 14 attended some 
school during at least a portion of the year is ascribed to the influence of the compulsory 
law and to the efforts of the secretary and agent in securing its enforcement.’ Of the 
teachers employed 470 were beginners, about the average number reported for each of the 
past five years. Onlyasmall fraction of these, it is supposed, prepare themselves for teach- 
ing by study, observation, or apprenticeship. The result is that many schools are poorly 
taught, particularly small ones in the rural districts, although the evil was not confined 
to these. The remedy pointed out is in a public opinion that’ shall demand a special 
preparation for teaching corresponding to that required in other employments, which, it 
is believed, would very soon create a supply of competent teachers.

  380 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The compulsory education law continued to work well and.to be approved by the people. 
Of the 26,100 youth of school age reported in no school, only 2,858, or less than 11 per 
cent. , belonged to the period of required attendance (8 to 14), a proportion largely ascribed 
to the systematic efforts made to diminish absenteeism and to the labors of Mr. Potter,# 
agent of the boatd. This officer reports that he found less neglect and careléssness of 
the right of children to an education than in any former year since hisemployment: that 
parents were nore mindful of their duty and that employers generally demanded the 
certificates which the lawrequires. The Willimantic Linen Company posted notices that 
after July 4, 1883, ability to read and write would be a condition of employment in their 
service. The managers adopted this rule purely on business principles, believing that 
ignorant labor is expensive and that the amount and quality of work, as a rule, are pro- 
portionate to the intelligence of the laborers. The compulsory law was amended by the 
general assembly of 1882 and much improved; the penalty for its violation is made less 
severe, but its provisions are more easily executed and more effective. During the year 
8 parents were prosecuted and fined for not sending their children to school, and one 
person for persistently employing children who had not.attended. A father who defied 
the law, and could not pay the fine nor furnish bonds, was sent to jail, where he remained 
three weeks, the first case that has occurred in the State of the imprisonment of a parent 
for not sending his child to school. This case had the desired effect, breaking up a kind 
of conspiracy to resist the law. No prosecutiéns are ever made until personal efforts to 
secure compliance by persuasion and admonition have failed. 
During the year the public schools lost. the services of Secretary Northrop, who in 
October resigned the position he had held for 16 years of chief executive of the board of 
education. The State board ascribes the great advancement in school interests during 
this period largely to his influence. In 1868 Connecticut was the only State in New 
England which had not established free schools by law. The proposition to make them 
free met with strong opposition and was carried only by the persistent efforts of men who 
were ready to sacrifice popularity for the public good. To Hon. James E. English, then 
governor of the State, and to Secretary Northrop, more than to any other two men, belongs 
the honor of securing the passage of the free school law of 1868. The reéstablishment 
of the State Normal School, suspended in 1867, was another important measure secured. 
through the sectetaty’s influence, and many others followed. Among the results of his 
Jabors may be mentioned an increased attendance on teachers’ institutes, improvement 
in school-houses and villages by the planting of trees, a repression of the sale of injuri- 
ous reading and a dissemination of information regarding good books, the enactment of a 
compulsory law through which public school attendance was enforced, and other provis- 
ions for the care of neglected children and the repression of truancy. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The 5 Kindergiirten noted in Table V in the report for 1881 as existing at Baapeert, 
Hartford, New Britain, New Milford, and Stamford appear to have been continued, one 
at New Haven being added in 1882.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The Bridgeport report shows a prosperous educational condition on the whole; enrole 
ment and average attendance increased, as well as the number of youth of school age; 
- but the percentage of attendance fell off slightly, tardiness increased nearly 6 per cent., 
and truancy did not diminish. The training school for teachers, a department of the 
public high school, sent out 11 teachers, all of whom received appointments in the vari- 
ous schools. Attendance on the evening drawing school was larger than during any 
previous winter, reaching 137, of whom almost all were mechanics and 80 beginners. 
The oldest student was 40, the youngest 16. 
Greenwich reports an increase of interest in the public schools and a slight advance of 
average daily attendance, although only about two-fifths of the youth of school age, or 
54 per cent. of the number enrolled, were in average attendance. In respect to attend- 
ance Greenwich ranks among the lowest 20 towns in the State. The reason given for 
non-attendance is not, as in many other towns, the employment of children in mills, but 
a lack of general interest in the schools. 
In Hartford, the school work is said to have been systematic and thorough. No mate- 
rial changes were made in the system of instruction or the list of teachers, The only ma- 
terial drawback to an otherwise successful year was the loss by fire of the high school 
building, in January, 1882. Measures were immediately taken for the erection of a new 
one, which at date of the report was well under way. Itis to be fire-proof, of two stories 
only, 236 by 95 feet, to cost, with furniture, $230,000, and will be one of the best struct- 
ures of its kind in the country. The work of the high school for the year was especially 
satisfactory, considering the disadvantages under which all had to labor in the loss of the 
building. The evening schools were as successful as usual, but'the question is being 
considered whether it would not be better to make 14 the minimum age for admission, 
instead of 12. ¢ 
The Meriden school officers and teachers found truancy the most perplexing problem 
with which they had to deal, the chief cause of it being the carelessness of parents on the 
subject. More thorough work than ever before was done in the inspection of factories 
with reference to the employment of children under 14, and most of the employers 
showed a readiness to obey the law. The high school, established in 1881, was emi- 
nently satisfactory during its first year. Among other results of its influence was the 
arrangement of a course of study for the lower schools. ‘These are now classed as pri- 
mary, intermediate, and grammar, the whole course up to the high school comprising 9 
years. 
The Middletown report shows an advance in public school enrolment and average at- 
tendance, truancy decreasing from 143 cases in 1881 to only 50; also, a decided improve- 
ment in discipline and in the moral tone of the schools, the latter ascribed to the dis- 
continuance of corporal punishment. 
In the school afiairs of New Haven the most important event of the year was the resig- 
nation, on December 31, 1881, of Mr. Ariel Parish, who had filled the office of school 
superintendent with great ability for more than 16 years. During that period public 
school attendance much more than doubled and the ratio of attendance to the enumera- 
tion increased by about 30 per cent., an advance much assisted by his conscientious and 
thorough management. Since the last report a portion of East Haven was, by act of the 
legislature, united to the city school district and placed under the care of the school 
board, thus increasing the need of school accommodations. Good healthand good attend-. 
ance helped to make the year a prosperous one in the schools. During the latter half of 
it a successful effort was made to have the ‘‘new methods” in primary teaching more 
universally understood and adopted. The evening schools were taught for 5 months 
and accomplished in many instances great good, the number enrolled being 575; average 
attendance, 150. An additionalspecial school for neglected children was opened, 194 being 
transferred to such schools and 46 promoted from them to their own. Truants to the 
number of 417 were arrested and taken to school, and 14 boys were sent to the State 
Reform School. There were 3,018 visits made to families with reference to non-attend- 
ance, and 150 children were reported not in any school. 
The schools of Norwich prospered, on the whole, with no marked changes in the man- 
agement or methods of instruction. Irregular attendance continued to be the greatest 
evil experienced, and this increased during the year without the unusual sickness which 
excused it the year before. The only adequate remedy is thought to be the arrest of 
truants by civil authority and their return to school. In discipline an effort was made 
to develop the capacity for self government. The result was very general good order, only 
a few cases of insubordination calling for more severe treatment. Teachers’ monthly 
meetings were well attended. An evening school, taught 14 weeks, accomplished a good. 
work jor the iew who continued until the close of the term.

  32 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
TRAINING OF. TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, NEW BRITAIN. 
About 175 pupils were connected with the school during the year and 39 were grad- 
uated. Nearly all the latter engaged in teaching, and the principal received calls for 
more teachers than he was able to supply. Little change took place during:the year 
in he teaching force or in methods of discipline and instruction. The course cevers 
2 years. ‘Applicants for admission must pass a satisfactory examination in the common 
English branches; they must also be at least 16 years old and of good moral character. 
Tuition is free to persons preparing to teach in the schools of Connecticut;the use of text 
books, too, is without charge. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
Provision is made for the training of teachers in classes or departments of the public 
high schools in some of the larger cities, especially at Bridgeport and New Haven. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Nine institutes were held during the year, each for a single day or for two evenings and 
a day. The attendance and interest were such as to encourage these short sessions. 
Time enough is given in them for many practical hints as to mistakes to be avoided 
and the best methods to be adopted. Efforts were made to adapt the instruction to the 
needs of beginners without normal school training by giving special attention to the every 
day work of the school room. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
All towns in this State are authorized but none are required to establish public high 
schools; if established, they receive nothing from the State. Statistics of those in opera- 
tion do not appear in the report for 1881-’82, but that for the previous year gave a list 
of 51 having claims to be considered such. 
The high school in Hartford enrolled 345 students in its classical and 89 in its English 
department. There were also 6 engaged in graduate studies. Of the 72 graduates 45 
were girls. 
The New Haven high school had 597 pupils registered and 350 in average daily attend- 
ance, with 14 teachers ; 58 graduates during the year (37 of them girls); a classical depart- 
ment, which prepared’ for the academical department of college; and an English depart- 
ment, which prepared for scientific study, for commercial and general business, and for 
teaching. There is also a special class intended particularly for those whose health is 
imperfect. Its members are required to be present only at recitation; they may,if they 
choose, take a single study ata time and eventually graduate with the same honors as the 
others, if as well*prepared. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and preparatory schools report- 
ing, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and summaries in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES, 
Yale College, New Haven, as heretofore, provides departments of theology, law, and 
medicine and one of philosophy and the arts, the last including graduate and under- 
graduate academical and scientific departments and a school of the fine arts, each with 
a distinct organization. During the year there was a total attendance in ‘all depart- 
ments of 1,096 students against 1,041 in 1881. In the academical department there 
was an increase of students and officers, although the number had been larger the pre- 
vious year than ever before. The proportion of students who were non-residents of the 
State continued to increase. From the required examinations for the admission of 
students to this department, the subjects of geography and English grammar were omit- 
ted. Entrance examinations may hereafter be held at Andover, Mass. Provision has 
been made by which students of the academical department may hereafter receive such 
instruction in the general principles of jurisprudence, as well as in constitutional and 
international law, as all ought to obtain before receiving the degree of bachelor of arts. 
Plans for the projected physical laboratory, for which funds were given in 1881, had 
been nearly matured; the legacy of $10,000 left in 1881 by the late Lucius Hotchkiss, 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
    i CONNECTICUT. 33 
for the aid of needy students, had been paid into the treasury, and a gift of $10,000 was 
receivedin 1882 from Hon. Elias W. Leavenworth, of the class of 1824. 
The schcol of the fine arts, the only department of the college open to both sexes, has in 
view thecu tivation and promotion of the arts of design, viz, painting, sculpture, and 
architecture, through practice and criticism. The exhibition of the year’s work con- 
tained 516 studies, including drawings from the antique and from the nude living model, 
portrait studies, anatomical and perspective drawings, architectural designs, pen and 
pencil sketches, copper plate etchings, compositions and studies in oil and water colors. 
During the year the college library was. increased by 4,400 volumes and 20,000 pam- 
phlets; the Peabody Museum received important additions; and gifts to the observatory 
came from various friends, amounting to $4,420, besides funds for the purchase of an 
equatorial telescope from one who withheld his name. 
Trinity College, Hartford, reports 84 students in 1881-82, a decrease for the year, and 
17 degrees of B. A. and 10 of M. A. conferred, besides 2 honorary of M. A. Gifts were 
received from Col. C. H. Northam, of Hartford, amounting to $155,000, of which $50,000 
were for the endowment of a professorship, $30,000 for a new building, and $75,000 for 
the general fund. 
Wesleyan University, Middletown, the only one of the 3 colleges of this State which 
offers equal privileges to both sexes, continued to provide 3 regular collegiate courses of 4 
years each, Classical, scientific, and Igatin-scientific. Of 170 students reported in regular 
undergraduate classes during the year, 14 were young women. One of the 6 graduate 
students and 3 out of 8 special students were also women. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of institutions of this class, see Table VIII of the appendix, and the sum- 
mary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
. SCIENTIFIC. 
The Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, besides making ample provision for 
graduate study in the higher scientific branches, presents a number of undergraduate 
courses, extending over 3 years and comprising instruction in chemistry, civil and me- 
chanical engineering, agriculture, natural history, biology (preparatory to medical stud- 
ies), and studies preparatory to mining and metallurgy and to other higher studies. These 
courses all lead to the degree of PH. B., but the degrees of doctor of philosophy and 
civil and dynamic engineer are only obtained after at least two years of graduate study. 
The progress of the school during 1882 was eminently satisfactory. A constantly in- 
creasing number of students were taking the course of instruction in biology, with a 
view to future medical study. The number in chemistry so increased that accommoda- 
tions for all could not be furnished, and it was found necessary to give notice to the agri- 
cultural experiment station of Connecticut that the rooms occupied by it in Sheffield 
Hall must be vacated. These, when fitted up for laboratory work, will, it is hoped, fur- 
nish sufficient space for a few years to come. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The schools for theological instruction in this State, as reported, are the Theological 
Seminary of Yale College (Congregational), Berkeley Divinity School, Hartford (Protes- 
tant Episcopal), and the Theological Institute of Connecticut, Hartford (Congregational). 
All have courses of study covering three years and demand a collegiate or equivalent 
preparation for admission, while the Seminary at Yale and the Institute at Hartford also 
make provision for graduate study. Of 97 students attending the Seminary at Yale, 7 
were pursuing advanced studies in a graduate class, the work of which was carried for- 
ward with success even beyond that of the previous year. The new library building, 
completed in September, 1881, was made a memorial of Dr. Leonard Bacon, in whose 
death the department sustained a great loss. The Theological Institute also reports a 
new building, Hosmer Hall, recently erected at a cost of about $100,000, a gift of the 
late James B. Hosmer. 7 
Legal instruction was given in the law department of Yale College to 73 students, 
including 5 of the senior class of the previous year in a graduate course, which, like the 
undergraduate course, extends over two years. Applicants for admission to thedepart- 
ment must be at least 18 years old, of good moral character, and, if not college grad- 
uates, must pass an examination in history of England and of the United States and in 
the Constitution of the United States, unless they have already passed the examination 
for law students prescribed by the Board of Regents of the University of New York. The 
condition of the department is reported as satisfactory, having been advancing since its

reorganization in 1869. Prior to that period it graduated 194 persons in 27 years, and 
during the 12 subsequent years 248 were graduated and 21 degrees in a graduate course 
Were granted. 
In the medical school of Yale College attendance has decreased since the standard was 
raised in 1879, Since then an examination has been required for admission and the time 
of attendance has included the entire academic year. Notwithstanding this decrease, 
the wisdom of the change is not doubted. Other causes besides this elevation of the 
standard tended to lessen the attendance, among them an increase in the cost of attend- 
ance. This was again reduced in 1882to an extent which it is hoped will result in bring- 
ing in a larger number of students. During the 3 years since the new plan of instruction 
was adopted there has been a steady increase in the number of hours given to instruc- 
tion by the faculty, amounting in 1881~’82 to a gain of 144, not including the time spent 
in dissections and autopsies. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The American Asylum for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Hartford, gave instruc- 
tion during the year to 219 students, of whom only 62 were from Connecticut, the others 
being from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Ma@sachusetts, and Rhode Island. The 
greatest number of students present at any one time was 183; average attendance, 180. 
No change has been made in the method of instruction already reported, which includes 
the manual alphabet, writing, articulation, and signs, the common school branches being 
taught, besides tailoring, shoemaking, and cabinet making to the boys. Although there 
Was an unusual number of beginners in the shops, a gratifying interest was shown and 
very creditable work turned out. 
Whipple Home School for Deaf-Mutes, near the village of Mystic River, is a family 
school, owned and conducted by Jonathan Whipple, its founder. The system of in- 
struction is by articulation and lip reading; the methods employed are*Whipple’s nat- 
ural alphabet, oral speech, and natural signs. As the pupil improves in speaking, the 
signs are discarded and speech becomes the medium of communication. Eleven pupils 
were under instruction during the year in the common English branches; also, in farming 
and gardening for boys and housework and sewing for girls.— (Circular and return.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
Connecticut has no institution for the blind, but provides for their instruction in the 
schools of other States. 
STATE REFORM SCHOOL, MERIDEN. 
This school reports a great improvement made during the Jast four years. Although 
the number of pupils has increased during this time trom 240 to 380, better influences 
have so far prevailed that for more than three years no boy has been sent to the lockup or 
subjected to any of the severe forms of punishment formerly in vogue, and corporal pun- 
ishnient is seldom inflicted. It has been clearly demonstrated that the law of kindness 
has a greater power for good than any coercive restraints. The boys have shown their 
appreciation of the new system by a uniform regard for all the requirements of the school, 
quiet, respectful behavior, and willingness to do as required. 
CONNECTICUT INDUSTRIAL SCHOQL FOR GIRLS, MIDDLETOWN. 
This school, a private charity with State aid, receives girls from 8 to 16 years of age, 
bestowing on them like care to that given boys in the State Reform School. The condi- 
tions of commitment are truancy, vagrancy, and manifest danger of fallinginto vice. The 
common English branches are taught, including history and voeal music, also general 
housework, paper-box making, flower gardening, dressmaking, and fancy work. After 
leaving the institution a correspondence is kept up with former pupils, who are also vis- 
ited by an agent. About 66®%per cent. of those discharged are known to have become 
orderly and useful members of society. There were 181 under instruction during 
1881-82, of whom 21 were colored and 12 foreign-born.— (Return. ) 
  TRAINING FOR NURSES. 
Two training schools for nurses report from this State, one at New Haven, organized 
in 1873, and the other in Hartford, organized in 1877, the former having had 23 under 
instruction during 1881 the latter, 16, Since 1873 the school at New Haven has 
given instruction to 200 pupils and has graduated 70. The school at Hartford has had 
81 on trial, of whom 39 were discharged at the end of the trial month, or before complet- 
ing the course, and 26 were graduated. The course of study in both extends over 18 
months.— (Returns. )

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
CONNECTICUT STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-sixth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at New 
Haven, October 26-28, 1882. After singing by a chorus of 128 members from the high 
school, showing superior musical training, President Warren delivered an inaugural 
address, after which a message was read from Mr. Ariel Parish, temporarily residing in 
Colorado. The address of the evening, by W. T. Harris, LL. D., of Concord, Mass., was 
on the theme ‘Do the public schools educate children beyond the position which they must 
oceupy in life?’? The speaker said, among other things, that we should consider what 
education ought to be as a whole; that in this country people make the laws as well as 
obey them, and that, therefore, education should not be wholly one of business. He 
opposed the idea that the common laborer ought to be contented with the lot in which he 
is placed by the accident of birth and said that no contented race has ever accomplished 
anything for which mankind are the better, that our civilization rewards the workman 
who is looking beyond the machine he is using to a better one that he has conceived in 
his mind, and that invention keeps pace with educated intelligence. The first exercise 
of the following day was on the Grube method of teaching numbers. Following the 
discussion on this was an illustration by a class, dressed in costume, of a method of cal- 
isthenics taught in the schools of Milwaukee, Wis. ‘‘ The relation of the public library 
to the public school’’ was considered in a paper by H. F. Bassett, of Waterbury, and, 
after a discussion as to the character of reading matter which should be provided, it was 
resolved that a committee be appointed by the chair to consider the subject and report 
at the next meeting. Exercises were given in map drawing, in teaching language in the 
lower classes, and in giving first lessons in script. A paper was read by Charles G. 
Leland, of Philadelphia, on the question ‘‘Should hand work constitute a part of all 
education?’ He claimed that the elements of hand work should be taught in the 
public schools, but not special technical instruction ; certain arts, but not trades; that 
simple outlines of decorative art require but little time and may be properly introduced, 
one lesson a week being given. Mr. L. H. Marvel, of Boston, presented some perti- 
nent facts, growing out of his experience in the supervision of a manual training school 
at Gloucester, Mass. A spirited discussion followed, participated in by Messrs. Beech 
of Windsor, Sheldon of Boston, Kellogg of New York, and others. An address by Rev. 
Newman Smyth, D. D., of New Haven, on ‘The art of thinking,” called out a large 
audience in the evening. The opening paper of the third day, by E. Sawyer, A. M., 
was entitled ‘‘ Less hours per day, more days in the year,”’ advocating shorter vacations 
and longer school terms, embracing 45 or 48 weeks, with only three hoursa day for study. 
A paper by T. I. Briggs, of Waterbury, on ‘“‘ The examination of teachers by the State,”’ 
advocated the enactment of a bill before the legislature concerning a State board of ex- 
aminers. After the adoption of resolutions and the election of officers for the ensuing 
year, the association adjourned.— (Journal of Education and State report.) 
CONNECTICUT COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
The State Council of Education met at Hartford, June 17, 1882, I. N. Carleton in the 
chair. The principal business before it was a consideration of the report of a committee 
appointed at the annual meeting to present the merits of the bill to secure the appoint- 
ment of a State board of examiners to the State legislature. From the committee’s re- 
port it appeared that the bill failed in consequence of the opposition of a few men from 
some of the large cities in the State, who feared that the measure might interfere with 
the operation of their city boards of education, although they acknowledged that it must 
do good in the sparsely settled districts for whose benefit it was especially intended. It 
was decided by the council that the bill, being in the line of true progress, must not be 
abandoned, and a new committee was appointed to bring the subject before the next 
legislature.— (Journal of Education. ) 
The sixth semiannual meeting was held December 29. A paper was read by Mr. M. 
S$. Crosby, reviewing Dr. W. T. Harris on ‘‘The church, the state, and the school.” 
Other papers, on the improvement of the present system of school supervision, on the con- 
ditions of growth in teaching power, and on the question whether there are too many 
studies in the public schools, were also presented.— (New York School Journal. ) 
OBITUARY RECORD, 
J. E. SHEFFIELD, 
Joseph Earle Sheffield, founder of the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, was 
born in Southport, Conn., June 19, 1793. His early education was obtained in the com- 
mon schools, which he left in 1808 to become a clerk in a business house at New Berne, 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
e 
36 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. \ 
N.C. In 1813 he formed a partnership with a house in New York, though continuing 
to live ia New Berne; butafterward he transferred his business to Mobile, Ala., and soon 
became one of the largest shippers of cotton in the country. Returning to the North in 
1835, he established himself in New Haven. A sagacious and successful business man 
as well as a generous giver, he was the chief projector of two railroads, was largely en- 
gaged in the construction of another, and was prominent in banking circles. 
Mr. Sheffield’s principal donations to Yale College were Sheflield Hall, twice enlarged 
and fitted up throughout; a fund of $130,000 for professorships; a library fund of $10,000, 
increased to $12,000; the Hillhouse Mathematical Library, costing $41,000; $2,700 to 
the Collier cabinet; North Sheffield Hall, erected and equipped at a cost of over $100,000; 
and numerous contributions to current expenses, amounting for ten years to $10,000 
annually, to the Scientific School, and during 1881 to $20,000, this additional sum being 
intended to increase the pay of professors. He also made large donations to Trinity Col- 
lege, Hartford, and to the Theological Seminary of the Northwest, in Chicago. He 
established a parish home, costing $75,000, in connection with Trinity Church, New 
Haven, and gave liberally to a great number of public institutions of various kinds in 
New Haven and elsewhere, the aggregate of his educational benefactions alone exceed- 
ing $650,000, to be probably more than doubled by his final bequests for such purposes. 
Mr. Sheffield was a prominent member of the Episcopal Church. His manner was 
that of the proverbial gentleman of the old school, gracious, gentle, charming, with the 
simplicity of the highest breeding and the kindliness of a noble heart that was always 
moved to helpfulness by a story of need or suffering. Until within the last two or three 
years he enjoyed good health, and even after eighty years of age his handwriting was as 
perfect and legible as that of a young man. He died February 16, 1882. 
HENRY A. YARDLEY. 
Henry A. Yardley, professor of Christian evidences and homiletics in the Berkeley 
Divinity School, at Middletown, Conn., born in Philadelphia December 20, 1834, died 
on Sunday, April 2, 1882, aftera longillness. He was graduated at, Yale in 1855, taking 
high rank as a scholar.— (Philadelphia Evening Telegraph. )

STATE SCHOOL. SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The officers of the State system are a superintendent of free schools, with an assistant, 
both appointed annually by the governor, and a State board of education, composed of 
the secretary of state, president of Delaware College, and the State superintendent. The 
president of Delaware College is president of the board, and the assistant superintend- 
ent, secretary. In each district, for schools for whites, committees of 3 members are 
elected by the people for 3 years, with change of one member each year. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYs' 
  cM. 
The State superintendent is required to report in writing to the governor annually the 
condition of the public schools and make any recommendations he may think proper.

38 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The State board determines what text books shall be used in the free schools. Theschools 
are sustained from ‘‘the school fund of the State of Delaware”? (which cannot be used 
for academies, colleges, or universities) and from a local tax which, in each school dis- 
trict of New Castle County, amounts to $150, of Kent County to $125, and Sussex County 
to $60, yearly, to be applied to the support of Schools in the district-in which the tax is 
raised. In addition, under special acts, other needed sums are authorized to be raised 
either annually or for a limited time in various school districts of the State. Two or 
more school districts in any county may unite in supporting a free school for their com- 
mon benefit. The State superintendent is to hold teachers’ institutes of 3 days’ session 
in each county once a year, which the teachers are required to attend in their respective 
counties. Teachers are required to submit to the proper authorities a quarterly report; 
otherwise their pay will be withheld. 
For the instruction of colored children the Delaware Association for the Education. of 
Colored People has in charge two separate funds, one of $2,400, annually appropriated 
from the State treasury since 1881; the other, a tax of 30 cents on the $100 of real and 
personal property and poll of colored persons, levied annually in aid of colored schools. 
The $2,400 is divided equally among the schools of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Coun- 
ties, no school receiving its pro rata unless it is sustained at least 3 months of the school 
year with an average attendance of atleast 15pupils. A body politic, called the “Indian 
River school districts for a certain class of colored persons,” is exempted from the regular 
taxation and establishes schools of its own, voting the sum required, not to exceed $200 | 
for the two subdistricts it embraces. Each school is to be open to the children of the 
persons specified, and is to receive a pro rata share of the school fund for colored people, 
provided that $25 have been raised by taxation for each school during the year and that 
the schools ave taught at least 3 months in the year with an average attendance of 20 
scholars. 
GENERAL CONDITION. . 
The schools for colored pupils under the care of the Delaware Association for the Edu- 
cation of Colored People, with the aid of a State appropriation, have done better than 
ever before, nearly every locality that could support a school having had one. New 
Castle County, including 2 schools in Wilmington, had 6 more schools and 327 more 
pupils; Kent County, 6 more schools and 357 more pupils; and Sussex County almost 
doubled the number both of schools and pupils. The teachers are said to have been 
prompt, energetic, and competent. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF WILMINGTON, 
OFFICERS, 
Wilmington— the only city in the State with more than 7,500 inhabitants—hasa board 
of public education composed of two members from each of its 11 wards. These mem- 
bers appear to be elected for 2-year terms, with change or reélection of 1 each year. The 
board employs a superintendent of schools, who has not been changed for many years. 
STATISTICS. 
The population of the city, according to the school report, was 45,000; youth of school 
age (6-21), not given; enrolment in 1881~’82 in public schools, 7,123; average number 
belonging to these schools, 5,191; average attendance, 4,600; teachers employed, 117; 
AS aaa for current needs of schools, $73,581; for new buildings, $15,791; total, 
9,372. 
: ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The schools were held in 1881-’82 in 19 buildings, with 116 rooms and 5,920 sittings; 
three new buildings were in course of erection, which it was believed would ‘accommo- 
date all likely to attend. The grades, probably only covering half a school year each, 
were 10 primary and 6 grammar, beyond which were 3 high school years. Industrial 
drawing enters into the studies of the grammar grades and geometrical drawing is con- 
tinued in the first high school year. Four pupil teachers are reported as in training 
and on trial in as many divisions of thetraining school. These receive no salary. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL TEACHING. 
The normal class formerly taught at the State College, Newark, seems to have been 
dropped. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
In place of the teachers’ institute at Wilmington, formerly held for city teachers of 
all grades, Supertendent Harlan writes that he now holds grade meetings, including 
 
-P-A-G-E-333

&. 
only teachers of one grade at each meeting, for suggestions as to their special work. | 
‘These are held after school hours about eight times a year.. The training school for 
candidates for teachgys’ places is continued. 
Of the county institutes held under the State law there is testimony from an unofficial 
source tending to show that the interest and enthusiasm of preceding years have not 
abated. S 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No specific provision for this class of schools appears in the State law, but 2 have long 
been sustained at Wilmington, 1 for each sex, with 3-year courses, which include at 
present only advanced studies in English. These schools had 5 teachers in 1881-82, 
with an enrolment of 110 and an average attendance of 83. A return from Dover shows 
also 2 high school rooms there, with 1 male and 1 female teacher and sittings for 96 
pupils, but does not give the statistics of attendance. 
OTHER SECONDARY TRAINING. 
Fourteen academic institutions report from this State, most of them giving instruction 
in the classics and about half offering also modern languages. The Wesleyan Female 
College, Wilmington, has an academic preparatory course for such as intend to take the 
English collegiate course, adding Latin for those expecting to enter the classic:l course. 
For statistics, see Tables VI and VIII of the appendix; for a summary, corresponding 
tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
STATE COLLEGE. 
Delaware College, Newark, first opened as a preparatory school in 1830, then for some 
years known as Newark College, and finally chartered under its present title in 1867, has 
admitted both sexes since 1872. It has no preparatory department; its collegiate work 
is embraced in 3 courses: classical, scientific and agricultural, and literary. The last 
mentioned is open to all, but is more especially intended for young lady students. It 
embraces English studies, with German or French and Latin, as required parts of the 
course, Latin being optional in the senior year. The faculty includes 5 professors, be- 
sides the president; the students in 1881-82 numbered 54, of whom 9 were graduated, 
4 of them from the literary course, none from the classical. Students in the first session 
of the next year, 52. 
COLLEGE FOR WOMEN. 
Wesleyan Female College, Wilmington (Methodist Episcopal), was chartered in 1841 
as the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute and in 1855 under its present title. It is the 
only college for women in the State; it has primary and preparatory as well as colle- 
giate classes, and permits in the collegiate a choice between a 3-year English and a 4- 
year classical course. The former embraced at the last accounts English studies only; 
the latter added to these French, German, and Latin. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific and agricultural department of the Delaware State College offers to stu- 
dents that can sustain an examination in the ordinary English school studies a well 
arranged course covering four years and leading to the degree of B. 8. This includes 
Latin, French or German, civil engineering, the natural sciences, laboratory practice; 
some training in tillage, stock breeding and feeding, fruit and cereal culture; and the 
elements of veterinary science. Military drill is obligatory in the fall and spring terms. 
Selection of studies is allowed, but the full course is strongly recommended. 
. PROFESSIONAL, 
No strictly professional schools appear to have been established. The State board of 
health examines candidates for medical practice who do not present diplomas from 
accredited medical schools. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES, BLIND, AND FEEBLE-MINDED. 
Unfortunates of these classes continue to be either cared for by the authorities of their 
respective counties and by parents and friends or are sent for training’ to institutions in 
Pennsylvania and elsewhere, One feeble-minded youth from Delaware is reported in an

EDUCATION OF ORPHANS AND FRIENDLESS CHILDREN. 
In a Home for Friendless and Destitute Children, Wilmington, about 700 in all had 
been under care and training up to the close of 1882, and out of about 70 inmates of the 
home some 50 were in the school connected with it.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Thesystem of public instruction continued to be administered by a State superintend- 
ent, a State board of education, a board of public instruction and a county superintend- 
ent for each county, local school trustees, treasurers, and agents. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The law provides that public schools shall be taught for at least three months each year, 
and any district neglecting to maintain them for that length of time forfeits its share of 
the common school fund during such neglect. They are sustained from the interest on 
that fund, a special tax of 1 mill on $1, and a county tax of not less than 2} nor more 
than 4 mills on $1. The interest of the school fund and the proceeds of the 1-mill tax 
are distributed among the several counties according to the numberof youth 4 to 21 years 
of age, but they are apportioned to the different schools in proportion to the average at- 
tendance of pupils between 6 and 21. The census of youth 4 to 21 and 6 to 21 must be 
taken every 4 years by the county tax assessor atthe timeof assessing taxes. Teachers’ 
certificates are of three grades, the standards being fixed by the State superintendent. They 
are granted by county boards on examination and are good in the county for 1 year; 
they are also granted by the State superintendent, good in any part of the State during 
the time specified in them. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
State Superintendent Foster reports that the cause of education advanced rapidly 
during the two years ending September, 1882, the number of public schools reported for 
that year being higher and the total enrolment greater than for 1879. The statistics 
for 1881 and 1882 also show advancement in most particulars, although it should be  
-P-A-G-E-336
42 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
noted that the reports are notsufficiently complete to render a comparison of much value. 
Thus, in 1881, 12 counties out of 39 failed to report the number of pupils enrolled, and 
in 1882 only 3 failed to give this item, while in both years 12 failed to rej 
ber in average attendance. Still the amount spent for teachers’ pay was greater in 1882 
in almost every county; and this fact, the superintendent says, is worthy of notice as 
indicating an increasing demand for the public school and an encouraging groyth in 
educational work. He hopes, however, that the time will come when teachers shall be paid 
according to their capacity and the character of their work, rather than on the basis of 
average attendance. He also suggests that the legislature enact a law with penalty 
attached requiring county superintendents to keep proper records and make full reports. 
PEABODY FUND AID. 
The trustees of this fund appropriated $1,900 for 1881-82 in aid of graded schools at 
Gainesville, Starke, Quincy, Pensacola, and Tallahassee; with $1,825 for State scholar- 
ships in the Normal Coliege at Nashville, Tenn., to prepare teachers for Florida schools,   
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
There is no separate city school system in this State. City schools are controlled by 
county school officers and no separate reports are made. 
STATISTICS. 
Key West, including Monroe County, with a population of 10,940, reported 3,416 youths 
of legal school age, and 1,069 attending public schools, under 20 teachers; public school 
property was valued at $12,500, and about $7,000 were expended during the year for 
public schools.— (Return. ) 
Jacksonville continued at the last accounts to have the primary, grammar, and high 
schools reported in 1881, but no statistics of them have been received up to the time at 
which this goes to print. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
East Florida Seminary, Gainesville, organized in 1880 as a State normal school, is 
supported from the proceeds of the congressional land grant and gives free tuition to one 
student from each legislative district. There were 155 enrolled during 1881~’82, of whom. 
40 were in a normal course of study. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State has long authorized the holding of teachers’ institutes, but it appears that 
none were held in 1881~’82. The legislature is said to have since made an appropriation 
for them. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Little information as to the public high schools of Florida for 1881—’82 has reached 
this Office. That at Jacksonville reported in 1881 a 3-year course, in which instruction 
was given in the usual high school branches, the school serving for Duval County as 
well as for the city. There is also high school training at Tallahassee, in the West 
Florida Seminary, and at Gainesville, in the East Florida Seminary. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For statistics of any academic schools reporting, see Table VI of the appendix, and for 
a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR, SCIE}    TIFIC, AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
STATE UNIVERSITY. 
The State constitution makes it the duty of the legislature to establish a State univer- 
sity, but as far as has been learned no steps had been taken in 1882 to establish more than 
the agricultural and mechanical departments of it. Provision for instruction in the pro 
fessions*of teaching, medicine, and law is directed to be made in this university, and at 
least one medical school is likely to avail itself of this.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND, DEAF, AND OTHERS. 
The constitution of 1868 says that ‘‘it is the paramount duty of the State to make 
ample provision for the education of all the children residing within its borders, without 
distinction or preference.” But thus far the blind, deat, feeble-minded, and children 
needing reformatory training do not appear to have had any benefit from this provision. 
Superintendent Foster now suggests that, as the census shows 119 Geaf-mutes in the State, 
78 of them within the school age, some institution should be provided in which they may 
be taught the mute language. Nothing is said as to provision for the other classes indi- 
cated, though there were 215 blind and 369 feeble-minded also shown by the census.   
  EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ MEETINGS. 
The school law makes it the duty of the State superintendent to call meetings of 
county superintendents and other officers for obtaining and imparting imformation on the 
practical workings of the school system and the means of promoting its efficiency and 
usefulness. No information has been received of such meetings for 1881-82.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State there is a board of education composed of the chief State officers, with 
the governor as president; there is also a State school commissioner, appointed by the 
governor every two years, who is the chief executive officer of the State board; for each 
county there is a board of education of 5 freeholders, holding office for 4 years, which elects 
a secretary, who is ex officio school commissioner; for each subdistrict into which a county 
may be divided 3 trustees are appointed by the county board for local supervision.
-P-A-G-E-339
  
  GEORGIA. 45 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State school fund is derived from a poll tax of not more than $1, from a special 
tax on shows and exhibitions and the sale of spirituous and malt liquors, from the half 
rental of one railroad and dividends on stock held in another, from the proceeds of com- 
mutation taxes for military service, from a tax on dogs, and from such other sums as 
may be authorized to be raised by general taxation. High schools are not provided 
for except in districts chartered before 1877, as the constitution since then provides 
for the elementary branches only. ‘he schools are free and provision is made for the 
separate instruction of white and colored children. Each county board of education 
prescribes what text and reference books shall be used, provided it does not introduce 
any books of a sectarian or sectional character or exclude the Bible. Ambulatory and 
manual labor schools are provided for in the school laws, as well as evening schools for 
such youth over 12 years of age as are unable to attend the day schools; but thus far none 
have been reported. Teachers, to receive their pay, must report to the county commis- 
sioner at the close of each term; he to the State commissioner, who reports annually 
to the general assembly. Primary schools, free to all, must be taught at least 3 months 
of the year to entitle a county to its proportion of the State fund. But when from 
sparsity of population a county cannot maintain a school for that time, the board may 
provide schools of at least 15 pupils, to continue 2 months, in places convenient to a 
majority of the children, the terms of which may be so arranged that the same teacher 
may serve in more than one of said schools. Each county commissioner examines can- 
didates for teaching; he must also visit the schools in his county twice a year, enumerate 
the school population quadrennially, distribute the school fund on the basis of such 
enumeration, and report annually to the State superintendent. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The condition of the public schools seems to have improved, the enrolment of pupils 
increasing by 12,235, the average daily attendance by 14,272, the number of teachers by 
223, and the receipts for school purposes by $85,642. For obvious reasons, the large addi- 
tions to the average attendance and to the funds for support of schools are especially en- 
couraging. As the reported attendance in elementary private schools continued tosensi- 
bly diminish, the number of teachers in such schools falling off still more, it looks as if 
the free State system would eventually absorb the private pay schools. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The proceedings of the Peabody fund trustees at their meeting in New York City, 
October 4, 1882, show that for 1881—’82 Georgia received from the fund. $8,590, of which 
$3,700 went for normal scholarships at Nashville for Georgia students ; $800 to the public 
schools of Americus ; $1,500 to Atlanta University, for normal training of colored stu- 
dents ; and $2,590 for State teachers’ institutes. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The report of the meeting of the State Teachers’ Association indicates that there were 
at least 12 children under Kindergarten training in a school of the Misses Chase and 
Thornbury, at Albany, Dougherty County; but no report from it has been received. 
A prospectus of the Atlanta Female Institute, Atlanta, for 1882~’83, shows that a Kin- 
dergarten department was to be established in that seminary in the autumn of 1882, 
under the charge of a young lady trained at St. Louis, Mo. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities of over 2,000 inhabitants may have independent school systems under boards of 
education or trustees of schools, mayors of cities and judges of courts sometimes being ex 
officiomembers. Augusta, Macon, and Savannah combine county and city systems,! and 
each city employs a superintendent.

46 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Atlanta, for 1881-82, reported 10 schools, 7 for white children and 3 forcolored. The 
total enrolment was, in high schools, 221 girls and 111 boys; white pupils in grammar 
schools, 2,943; colored, 1,477. There was still a lack of room in all grades, and there was 
room for only half of the colored children of the city. The employmentof colored teach- 
ers for colored pupilsis said to be a success. Private and parochial schools enrolled 1,000 
upils. 
ti Augusta had a graded system of schools, classed as primary, intermediate, grammar, 
and high schools, the studies in the primary grades occupying 3 years; in the interme- 
diate and grammar, 2 years each; and in the high school department, 3 years. There 
were two normal classes, one for white teachers and one for colored. 
Columbus had 7 school-houses, with 1,282 sittings, valued, with grounds, buildings, 
&c., at $39,700. In the primary schools 992 pupils were enrolled and in the grammar 
556. The estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools was 275. 
Macon reports 8 school buildings, with accommodations for 1,420 pupils; value of 
buildings, including grounds, &c., $55,500. The primary and grammar courses cover 7 
years and the high school 2. There were 2 normal classes gratuitously instructed by the 
superintendent. The graduates of the high school for 1882 numbered 18 girls and 14 
boys, 7 more than ever before graduated during one year. The superintendent reports, 
too, that a much higher proportion of the graduating class were trained in the public 
schools exclusively; also, that there had been a steady advance in attendance and deport- 
ment. The enrolment in private and parochial schools was 400. 
Savannah had'7 white schools and 2 colored, with an enrolment of 1,658 girls and 1,497 
boys. Two high schoolshad an average daily attendance of 147. Below the high schools 
there are 8 grades, beginning with the lowest elementary studies. Although the esti- 
mated value of school property was $105,500, the city was in need of more school room 
to accommodate the growing enrolment. In private and parochial schools there were 600 
pupils. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
There is no school under State direction especially devoted to normal training, but 
State Commissioner Orr earnestly recommends that a State normal school be established. 
This he does on the ground that the constitution requires a thorough system of common 
schools; that to such a system thoroughly prepared teachers are necessary, and that these 
can only be secured by means of a normal school. 
The Peabody fund, by means of an appropriation of $3,700 for scholarships, provided 
for a number of specially selected white students from this State at the Normal College 
at Nashville, Tenn. 
The Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College, Milledgeville, and the North 
Georgia Agricultural College,, Dahlonega, both offered free normal instruction to students 
of either sex who wished to become teachers. Certificates of proficiency granted by the 
faculty enable their holders to teach without further examination. 
Atlanta University (for the superior instruction of the colored race) presented a 4-year 
normal course, in which were'61 students, of whom 10 (young women) were graduated 
in 1882. 
Clark University, Atlanta, gives a 4-year course of normal training for colored teachers, 
The Haven Normal School, Waynesboro’, for the instruction of colored teachers, as- 
sisted by the Freedman’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, presented a 
4-year course of study. There appears to have been an enrolment of 80 pupils, under 2 
instructors, the same as reported the preceding year. 
Some normal instruction was given to the teachers of public schools in Augusta and 
Macon by the superintendents, classes being held so as not to interfere with school 
duties.   
  TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Superintendent Orr reports that, failing to obtain an appropriation from the general 
assembly for holding teachers’ institutes, he applied to the agent of the Peabody fund 
for the necessary means, and had $2,000 put at his disposal. With this sum he con- 
ducted 3 institutes, at Americus, in South Georgia; Milledgeville, in Middle Georgia; and 
Toccoa, in North Georgia. Several eminent gentlemen visited the institutes and deliv- 
ered lectures. They were held during the entive month of August. The one at Ameri- 
cus, W. H. Baker, superintendent, had an attendance of 41 white teachers and 41 colored, 
representing 22 counties. Daily instruction was given in common English branches 
and in the practical work of teaching. The institute held at Milledgeville, B. M. Zettler, 
superintendent, enrolled 68 white teachers and 47 colored, with an average daily at- 
tendance of 71 during the session of 4 weeks. In addition to the regular exercises, each
-P-A-G-E-341

Fridwy was given to the diseussion of questions relating to difficulties and matters occur- 
ring daily in school. The institute held at Toccoa, H. C. Mitchell, superintendent, had 
in attendance 45 white and 10 colored teachers and 15 county commissioners, representing 
30 counties. The common branches were taught, with instruction in the hygiene of the 
school room and analysis of English poetry. The institutes are said to have accomplished 
much good for the educational interests of the State. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The proceedings of the Georgia Teachers’ Association for 1882 show that 4 periodical, 
entitled the ‘‘Musical Eclectic and Journal of Education,’’ was established in the spring 
of that year at Macon. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIG HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No provision is made in the constitution of 1877 for high school instruction in the 
public schools, but in a few cities and counties under local laws high schools are sustained. 
Atlanta, Augusta, and Savannah in 1881~’82 had each 2 separate high schools for whites, 
with courses of 3and 4 years. Augusta had alsoone for colored youth. Those at Atlanta 
had 332 pupils, of whom 40 were graduated in 1882. The one for white girls at Augusta 
reported an enrolment of 100; that for white boys and girls, an enrolment of 22, under 
3 teachers. The full course was 3 years. The cost for each enrolled scholar is reported 
to have been only $2.17 a month. Statistics of the third school (for colored boys and girls) 
are not given, but the school is said to be thoroughly taught. Macon @entral High 
School, for white boys and girls, had 3 teachers and 111 pupils, of whom 32, the highest 
number ever reached, were graduated in 1882. At Savannah there was a high school for 
boys and also one for girls, with courses of four years and an enrolment of 186 pupils, 
under 5 instructors. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of commercial schools, academies, special preparatory schools, aid pre- 
paratory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and 1X of the appendix, and 
the summaries thereof in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Georgia, Athens (non-sectarian), had for 1881-82 collegiate, law, 
and medical departments. In the collegiate department there were 10 schools, but in- 
struction was given in scientific and literary courses of four years each. The total num- 
ber of students in all the departments, including four branch colleges, was 900. 
Seven other institutions of different grades, but all claiming collegiate rank, present 
themselves, namely: Atlanta University and Bowdon College (non-sectarian), Clark Uni- 
versity and Emory College (Methodist: Episcopal), Methodist College (Methodist Church 
South), Mercer University (Baptist), and Pio Nono College (Roman Catholic). These all 
had classical courses of four years, some of them beginning at a low point, and all but 
Mercer did some preparatory work. College Temple, Newnan (non-sectarian), presents 
preparatory and collegiate courses, but not of high grade. Atlanta steadily advancing 
and Clark beginning full collegiate instruction, gave some industrial training to both 
sexes, teaching the young men the elements of mechanical trades and farming, and the 
young women cookery, nursing, sewing, and housework. Pio Nono offered graduate in- 
struction, but had no students beyond the sophomore year. Clark University presented 
an English classical course. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Atlanta and Clark Universities, Bowdon College when last heard from, and College 
Temple gave equal instruction to young women. ‘There were 16 institutions reported for 
young ‘women alone, all giving instruction in music, drawing and painting, and modern 
Janguages. For statistics, see‘Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. 
SCTENTIFIC. 
The State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts offered courses of 4 years in 
agriculture, horticulture, and natural history; engineering ; and chemistry ; with a course 
in building and architecture of undefined length. ‘To aid in the instruction in chemistry, 
the citizens of Athens gave a 3-story building, 100 by 50 feet, costing $25,000, and the    
 
-P-A-G-E-342

legislature added $15,000 to equip this with requisites for chemical and physical work, as 
well as with aids to instruction in engineering. Somescientific training was offered also 
in the four branch agricultural colleges andin the courses of Atlanta and Clark Universi- 
ties; while at Mercer University, Emory College, and Pio Nono College there were special 
scientific courses, of 3 years in Mercer and Emory and of 4 at Pio Nono. 
For statistics, see Tables IX and X of the appendix; for a summary of them, like tables 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Of the 9 schools for superior instruction of young women mentioned on page 45 of 
the report for 1881 as having laboratories and apparatus for illustration of instruction in 
chemistry and physics, all but 3 continued to report these (Andrew College, Cuthbert, 
and Monroe College, Forsyth, not heard from, and Georgia Female College, Madison, said 
to have lost its buildings by fire). College Temple, Newnan, and Wesleyan Female Col- 
lege, Macon, ate to be added to the list of those with such aids, and Columbus Female 
College, Columbus, reports considerable additions to its means of training in science. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction continued to be given to some extent in Atlanta University (Con- 
gregationalist), Atlanta Baptist Seminary, and Clark University (Methodist Episcopal), 
all at Atlanta and all for colored youth, as well as at Emory College, Oxford (Methodist 
Episcopal South), and at Mercer University, Macon (Baptist). Theological classat Atlanta 
University, 4 in 1882; at the Baptist Seminary, 44; at Mercer, 13; at Clark and Emory, 
some theological students in the courses, though not separately indicated. 
Legal training, covering a collegiate year, was given at the University of Georgia and 
at Mercer University (the former recommending two years of study). Graduation admits 
to practice in any of the courts of the State except the supreme court. For men of busi- 
ness, there is at the former a course of instruction in legal forms and mercantile law to 
which seniors in some of the college courses are admitted. Professors and lecturers at 
the University of Georgia, 6; at Mercer University, 3. 
Medical instruction has been brought under control in this State by an act of Septem- 
ber 27, 1881, to regulate the granting of medical diplomas, which forbids the granting of 
a medical diploma to any person that has not attended two or more full courses of study 
in some regularly chartered medical college in good standing and passed an examination 
satisfactory to the professors of said college in all the branches usually taught in such 
colleges. A further act of September 28, 1881, regulates medical practice by requiring 
that no one shall practise medicine in the State without legal authority to do so, evi- 
denced first by a diploma granted by an incorporated medical college, medical school, or 
university, and next by registration in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the 
county in which he practises. 
The ‘‘regular’’ schools for instruction were in 1882, as in 1881, Atlanta Medical Col- 
lege and Southern Medical College, both at Atlanta, and the Medical College of Georgia, 
Augusta, a department of the University of Georgia, the first with 12 instructors, the 
second with 11, and the third with 15. All required the customary 3 years of study un- 
der a medical preceptor, with attendance for at least 2 years on the regular lecture 
courses, which are stated to be of only 19 weeks each at the Southern College, of 18 at the 
Atlanta College, and of 17 at Augusta, all 3 below the standard of the American Medi- 
cal Association. The Savannah Medical @ollege is reported to have suspended in 1880. 
, The College of American Medicine and Surgery, with 6 professors, and the Georgia 
Eclectic Medical College, with 8, the only schools other than the ‘‘regular’’ schools 
above mentioned, both had the same general requirements as those above referred to, 
but the annual lecture course at the latter was 20 weeks; at the former, only 16 weeks. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Georgia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, at Cave Spring, in 
1882, had 86 pupils, 17 of whom were only semi-mute. There were 5 instructors; 1 of 
them was a deaf-mute and 2 were semi-mutes. The method of instruction was manual, 
the common English branches being taught, with shoemaking as the leading industrial 
occupation. 
There is no official report available respecting the education of the blind in Georgia 
during 1882. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The sixteenth annual session of the Georgia Teachers’ Association convened at Augusta 
May 2, 1882. There were 60 members present, President G. M. Dews in the chair. 
The first day was given to addresses, and in the evening session there was an interesting
-P-A-G-E-343

discussion on ‘‘ Methods of increasing the interest of the teachers in the association and 
its objects.”” There was a notable increase of members and visitors on the second and 
third days. Text books and the common English branches were discussed, and some of 
the methods of Kindergarten instruction were illustrated by Misses Chase and Thorn- 
bury, with 12 little children from their school at Albany. The members were encour- 
aged by the result of the meeting and adjourned to meet at Athens in May, 1883.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A superintendent of public instruction has the supervision of ali the common schools 
of the State, and it is his duty to report their condition biennially; a county superin- 
tendent visits the schools in each county to note the methods of discipline and teaching, 
and to assist teachers and school officers in improving them; while in each township a 
board of three trustees of schools has charge of public school-houses and sites, and under 
certain restrictions may divide cr create districts, in which districts, however, when 
created, boards of 3 school directors! have supervision and control. All these officers are 
elected by the people, the State and county superintendents for 4 years, the others for 
3 years, with annual change of one. By act of 1873 women were made eligible to any 
school office in the State and several have proved efficient county superintendents. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The common schools of each district are free to all of school age (6-21) residing therein, 
irrespective of color. The studies to be pursued and the text books to be used are de- 
termined by the local school authorities; but no sectarian instruction is allowed and no 
change of text books may be made oftener than once in four years. The minimum 
school period which will entitle districts to a share of the school fund embraces 110 
days of actual teaching in one year. The required studies are spelling, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, grammar, ‘and geography; also, for higher classes, the elements of the natural 
sciences, United States history, physiology, and the laws of health. Other branches 
may be introduced at the discretion of the directors or voters of a school district. Free 
instruction is given in two State normal schools and in a State University. Persons un- 
dertaking to teach in any public school must prove their qualifications, moral and edu- 
cational, before the proper officers, and must obtain certificates from them to secure em- 
ployment; teachers must report, in legal form and time, to receive pay for their work. 
‘Towards this for teachers Tilinois appropriates $1,000,000 annually. To prolong the 
yearly instruction to 9 months the directors of districts “and the authorities of villages 
and cities are authorized to levy any year a tax on property not to exceed 2 per cent. 
for educational and 3 per cent. for building purposes. The State appropriation goes to 
townships, villages, and cities in which schools are taught 110 days, according to the 
number of persons under 21 years of age, as ascertained by an annual census. Any 
surplus of district, village, or city school funds may be expended for libraries and appa- 
ratus, and the statistics of the preceding table show that 895 districts haveavailed them- 
selves of this permission. 
    GENERAL CONDITION. 
In Illinois, with an increase of $5,345 in children of school age, there were fewer 
public schools reported by 14, fewer ‘school-houses by 22, and fewer teachers by 270; 
notwithstanding this, 15,936 more pupils were in the State schools and 26,627 more were 
in average daily attendance. In new buildings for public schools there was an increase 
of 38 and public school property was rated $1, 220, 666 higher. Of the schools 1,120 were 
graded and 144 of these were high schools, an increase of 57 graded schools i in all. In 
the graded schools 295,620 pupils were enrolled (41.4 per cent. of the whole public school 
enrolment), an increase of 18,034 pupils, or of more than 14 per cent., while attendance 
in ungraded schools fell off 2, 098. Receipts were $358,281 greater than in 1880-’81 and 
expenditures $709,261 higher, the latter partly due to an increase in the pay of teachers, 
averaging $2.69 a month for men and $2.27 for women. 
IMPROVEMENTS RECOMMENDED. 
While speaking well of the State school system as a whole, Superintendent Slade 
suggests and urges improvements at some points. As to text books, he says that, not- 
withstanding an 1 explicit Jaw for uniformity, many school boards do not prescribe the 
books for use within their districts and that in many other cases the books prescribed are 
not used because of the opposition of parents unable or unwilling to procure them. 
From this and other causes several different books are frequently in use in the same 
class, embarrassing the teacher and hindering effective work. He therefore urges the 
passage of a law by which school boards shall be authorized to purchase the text books 
for use in their respective schools and to furnish them to pupils without charge, except 
for misuse; the expense of this would be much less to a whole district than the present 
plan of individual purchase, and the advantage to the teacher and pupils from uniform- 
ity of books would be very great. 
As to county superintendency, he repeats his recommendations (1) that only men ot 
    
Districts with 2,000 or more inhabitants are exceptions as to the number and title of the school board. Sce School Systems of Cities with 7,500 or More Inhabitants, p. 52.

  52 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
women whose qualifications have been carefully ascertained should be made superin- 
tendents; (2) that superintendents be required to inspect the schools of their counties, 
being allowed assistants for this purpose in the larger counties; and (3) that the pay of such 
officers be increased. The experience of the last two years has convinced him of the 
necessity of these amendments. As the present law Icaves it to county boards to say 
whether county superintendents shall inspect the schools or not, only about one-third of 
the schools were visited by them in 1882. The amount paid county superintendents in 
1872 was nearly double ($123,730) the amount paid in 1882 ($74,841), although the 
number of schools was smaller. In 1872, 9,243 schools out of 11,396 were visited once 
and 2,250 more than once; in 1882, 4,484 schools out of 11,948 were visited once and 
941 twice. The pay has been so reduced that in more than two-thirds of the counties 
the best paid teachers could only accept the office of county superintendent at a peeun- 
iary loss unless they failed to give their whole time to their work. 
Compulsory education of children 8 to 15 years of age is also urged; and it is under- 
stood that the legislature to which the report embodying these suggestions was pre- 
sented enacted a law to secure it. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
More than 20 of these means of instruction are reported in Ilinois for 1881-’82, for 
statistics of which, see Table V of the appendix. 
At Cook County Normal School 8 Kindergartners were graduated in December of the 
school year 1881-82. 
Under the auspices of the Free Kindergarten Association of Chicago, a new impulse 
was given to this class of instruction and its advantages were brought within the reach 
of a much larger number of children. The assoaiation seeks to extend these advantages 
to the poor as fast as funds and teachers can be secured. 
  SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS, 
Chicago, under a special law for cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, has a board 
of education of 15 members appointed by the mayor, with the advice and consent of the 
common council. Cities and school districts with 2,000 or more inhabitants not governed 
by special law have elective boards of education of 6 members till the population reaches 
12,000, when 3 more members are added, and so on for every subsequent addition of 
10,000 inhabitants. One-third of each board is liable to change each year. In most 
eases these boards employ superintendents and delegate to them the supervision of 
schools. Chicago has also a deputy superintendent.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
From Alton, Aurora, Cairo, Danville, Galesburg, Jacksonville, Joliet, and Peoria no 
information for 1881—’82 has been received. 
Belleville, according to written returns, increased by 155 its youth of school age, ay 136 
its public school enrolment, and by 2 the number of teachers in 1881-’82; but showed a 
loss of 12 in average attendance; school property was rated $15,425 higher. To remedy 
overcrowding, the city board was preparing to make additions to the school buildings; the 
improved arrangements, it was hoped, would better accommodate the different grades, 
which were 8 in number, there being no high school. German appears to have been 
taught in all the grades by German teachers. Private and parish schools enrolled 675
-P-A-G-E-347
      ILLINOIS. 53 
pupils. It was from superintendent ofschools in this city that Mr. Raab was promoted 
in 1882 to be State superintendent. ‘ 
Bloomington shows for 188182 an increase in youth 6 to 21. School property was 
rated at $300,200; the sittings for study numbered 3,100. The schools were held for 175 
of 180 school days of the year in 10 different buildings, one of which contained 3 high 
school rooms. To aid.in preparation for the various manufacturing pursuits open to 
pupils in the place, industrial drawing formed a part of the school course. 
Chicago, reporting fully, both in print and by written return, indicates for 1881~’82 a 
growth of 18,131 in youth of school age and an additional enrolment of 5,473 in its day 
schools, with an additional daily average attendance of 3,462, under 54 more teachers. 
There were also 1,057 more enrolled in evening schools, with 98 more in average attend- 
ance. It seems from these figures that, with 7,038 additional pupils reported in private 
and church schools, more than 74 per cent. of the 18,131 new school youth were brought 
under instruction of some kind. One of the evening schools was a high school, in which 
advanced mathematics, book-keeping, chemistry, mechanical drawing, and stenography 
were taught. This had 274 pupils on its roll, most of whom were to attend only on 
alternate evenings; average attendance, 65. An evening school for newsboys was also 
held under city teachers at the Newsboys’ Home, with an enrolment of 195 and an 
average attendance of 37. In the day schools instruction in German made considerable 
progress; two more schools began the language and the pupils studying it increased from 
4,827 to 5,332; many of the most successful teachers of it were graduates of the city high 
schools. The 5 city schools for deaf-mutes were continued during the year under the 
same teachers, with 2 more pupils (57 in all); instruction in the articulation method was 
given to such as desired it, and instruction in morals and manners once a week. In the 
schools generally discipline is said to have been improved under the milder system of 
the last.few years. Instead of teaching pupils to memorize merely, an attempt was 
made to teach them to observe and think. Drawing was prosecuted with new interest, 
especially in the higher grades and as a preparation for industrial and mechanical pur- 
suits. Singing, under the interval system, is reported to have made great progress. 
Five new school-houses, with accommodations for 4,347 pupils, were completed at a cost 
of $232,639, school property advancing from $2,763,396 to $3,456,810. Other buildings 
were in process of construction. 
Decatur gave all its teachers better pay; with 49 more children of school age, 104 more 
were enrolled and 101 more were in average attendance. The estimated value of school 
property was $106,000. : 
The increased enrolment in the public schools of Elgin almost equalled the increase 
in youth of school age, and with only two more teachers there were 191 more in average 
daily attendance. The valuation of school property was $12,170 higher than in 1880-81 
and accommodations were afforded for 136 more pupils. 
Freeport, enrolling 60 more children in public schools, had 6 more in average attendance 
under 2 more teachers. In schools other than public there were 260 more pupils than 
in the previous year. : 
Lake anid Hyde Park (townships in the suburbs of Chicago, with a totel population of 
34,096) are reported together by the superintendent of the Cook County schools. They 
included 7 districts, with 24 schools, all graded and 3 of them high. Out of a school 
population of 11,403 these schools enrolled 7,680 pupils, under 134 teachers. There are 
8 grades below the high school. Drawing and music were taught, the former up to the 
sixth grade, the latter throughout the whole eight grades. e high school courses beyond. 
these were of 3 years. ‘The Cook County Normal and Training School prepared teachers 
for all the county schools, and was to have the author of the Quincy methods at its 
head in 1883. School property in Lake and Hyde Park was valued at $495,205. 
Ottawa reports for 1881-’82 3 fewer teachers. School property was rated $1,110. 
higher. Estimated number in private and church schools, 273. 
Quincy, with an increase of 452 in youth of school age, enrolled in its public schools 
204 more and had 75 more in average daily attendance, under 3 additional teachers. 
The superintendent says that of children 6 to 16 years of age 54 per cent. attended 
public schools and 25 per cent. private or church schools. Seven additional rooms in a | 
new building were occupied in December to accommodate the increased attendance, which, 
however, was afterwards diminished by an outbreak of disease. To this loss in attend- 
ance a decision of the supreme court of the State that colored children must be admit- 
ted to all schools equally with whites also contributed, many of the colored children 
being withdrawn from their own schools, although there was no accommodation for them 
in the schools for whites. The grades below the high school were changed frem 7 to 8, 
the high school retaining its 4-year course, in which German, Greek, and Latin are 
optional. Drawing and music run through the 12 years. 
While Rockford’s public schools enrolled fewer pupils by 355, notwithstanding an ad- 
dition of 526 to the youth of school age, the city increased its average attendance by

  54 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
170 and its enrolment in other than public schools by 320, gave tts teachers better pay, 
and added 210 new sittings to its public school accommodations, the valuation of school 
property advancing $11,159. Grades, primary, grammar, and high. 
Rock Island, in returns for the 2 years ending June 30, 1882, reports the school pop- 
wation and number of teachers unchanged, with a decrease in the latter year of 15 in 
enrolment and of $2,700 in valuation of school property, but an increase of 11 in average 
attendance on public schools and of 144 in the enrolment in other schools. 
Springfield enrolled 138 more pupils in 1881—’82, and had 66 more in average attend- 
ance, with 3 more teachers. The schools were uncomfortably crowded but the work 
of the. year appears to have been successful. There are 8 school grades below the 
high school, the courses in which were of 4 years. Drawing and music formed a part of 
the instruction in primary and grammar grades, and the former was continued through 
the high school course. A teachers’ institute, held every month during the school ss 
sion, appears to have been of great practical value. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE, COUNTY, AND CITY SCHOOLS FOR NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Illinois State Normal University, Normal, and the Southern INinois Normal Univer- 
sity, Carbondale, both under State direction, continued in 1881-82 their work of pre- 
paring teachers for the public schools, with incidental instruction of many others. 
The Illinois Normal, with 14 regular instructors and 136 pupil teachers, had 474 dif- 
ferent normal students in its 3-year course, 2 graduate students, 8 in special science 
studies, and 288 in the model school, which contains primary, grammar, and high school 
grades; total for the school year 1881-’82, deducting 40 counted twice, 732. In aspecial 
summer normal term for teachers, held in August, 1882, 261 were present at least 6 days 
each, of whom 171 had never been in the regular normal classes. 
The Southern Ilinois, which had 12 regular instructors and 22 pupil teachers, reported 
for the same period 184 different normal students in its 3 and 4 year courses, with 223 
in the preparatory training school, 407 in all. At this school there was also a vacation 
summer institute in 1882, at which 59 were present. 
Cook County Normal School, Normalville, prepares teachers for the schools of that popu- 
lous county in a regular course of 3 years, of 3 terms each year, and in a special profes- 
sional course which may be completed in 4 terms by graduates of high schools and persons 
with equivalent preparation. Its training school of primary and grammar grades exhib- 
its.and affords opportunity for practising the best methods of teaching, discipline, and 
classification. There was also a Kindergarten department, from which, at the close of 
1881, 8 Kindergartners were graduated. Pupils in 1881-82 in normal department, 202, 
under 10 instructors; in preparatory department, 162; in training school, 183; total, 547. 
Graduates of the year, 40. 
A renewal in some form of the work of training teachers to supply vacancies in the 
Chicago city schools has been recommended by successive superintendents since the abo- 
lition in 1878 of the training class at the city high school, but the reports of the school 
board and superintendent for 1881~’82 give no indication that such a renewal is contem- 
lated. 
a At Springfield a monthly teachers’ institute for discussion of improved methods in all 
school work appears to serve the purpose of a continuous training school for the teachers 
in that city. ° 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
  Fourteen academic schools offer instruction in school law, school studies, methods of 
discipline, &c., to persons desiring teachers’ certificates or a better preparation for school 
work, and in 13 collegiate institutions normal training was continued. In addition to 
these means of normal training outside of the State normal schools and the Cook County 
Normal School, several private summer normals were in operation. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Of this important class of agencies for improving teachers already in the schools and of 
preparing candidates for effective future school work, 147 were hel by county superin- 
tendents and 17 by other persons in 1881, covering 1,385 days in all and enrolling 7,638 
teachers, at an expense to the counties of only $673. Besides these, 676 other meetings of 
teachers in townships and school districts were held for mutual improvement, In 1882 
there were 151 institutes reported as held by county superintendents and 62 by other 
persons, covering 1,577 days and enrolling 6,657 teachers, at an expense to the counties 
of only $742. Of other teachers’ meetings in townships or districts 519 were reported. 
This record for both years shows a decrease from 1820 in the number of institutes held 
and the number attending them. The Chicago Institute of Education cultivates peda- 
gogy-

EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
Of these valuable aids to teachers there were 11 in this State in 1882: the Normal 
Journal, Carmi, in its first volume and the beginning of the second, which seems also to 
have proved its last; the Practical Teacher, Chicago, in its fifth; the. Present Age, Chi- 
cago, in its first; the Western Educational Journal, Chicago, in its third; the School 
Herald» Chicago, in its first; the Schoolmaster, Chicago, in its second; the Normal Mir- 
ror, Danville, in its first; the American Educator, Lockport, in its seventh; the Normal 
Worker, Morris, in its third; the Ilinois School Journal, Normal, in its first; and the 
Iapi Oaye, or Word Carrier, published at Chicago, in Indian and English, for the Dakota 
Mission at the Santee and Yankton Agencies, Nebraska. All are monthlies except the 
Present Age, which is a weekly. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, : 
Superintendent Slade, in his excellent report for 1881-82, gives statistics of 144 high 
schools belonging to the State school system, such only being in the list as had courses 
of 3 years or more. Of the 144 reported, 81 had courses covering 3 years; 3, courses be- 
tween 3 and 4 years; 4, courses that might be of either 3 or 4 years, as students and 
parents should desire; 55 had 4 years in the regular course; and 1 had 5 years. One of 
these high schools had a session of oniy 6 months; another, of 7 months; 42, sessions of 
8 months; 12, sessions covering more than 8 months but not reaching 9; while 62 had 
9 months; 1, 9} months, and 25 had 10 months. The enrolment in the schools thus 
enumerated reached 11,004 within the year; the average attendance, 9,060, or 82.4 per 
cent. of the enrolment. The teachers employed numbered 370, at salaries ranging from 
$20 a month to $250. The yearly cost for each pupil enrolled was only $23.21 for tui- 
tion, or $26.08 for tuition and incidental expenses. Thirteen of these high schools had 
separate buildings, valued, with grounds and furniture, at $399,250. A hundred and 
twenty-one of them had libraries, the volumes in these numbering 26,390, libraries and 
apparatus being valued at $69,018. Such full statistics as to schools of this class are 
rarely to be had, many States making no report of them and other States only brief and 
incomplete reports. : 
    OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Statistics of business colleges, private academies, independent preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges and scientific schools may be found, as far as reported 
to this Bureau, in Tables IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of the appendix to this report; sum- 
maries of them, in corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The only institution for superior instruction under State direction was the Illinois In- 
dustrial University, Urbana, chartered in 1867 and organized in 1868. In its college of 
literature and science the chief studies of a good classical course are presented in a school 
of ancient languages. French and German are taught in the school of English and mod- 
ern languages. The standard of admission to the university has been rising gradually 
for.several years. As to the technical courses, it was satisfactory in 1882; but it is 
urged that the requirements for admission to the literary and classical courses should be 
immediately advanced. Preparatory instruction at the university, which it was hoped 
might be dropped in 1881, was continued; but as the State high schools become more 
efficient the faculty hope to be able soon to leave to them all preparatory work. In 
1882 the list of schools allowed to send their graduates into the freshman classes without 
examination numbered 30, while 10 other schools examined candidates for admission, the 
papers being sent to the university for final decision. 
As to other training in the 3 additional colleges and 2 scientific schools of the univer- 
sity, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, p. 56. 
.. Besides the State University, 28 schools of recognized collegiate standing were on the 
list of this Bureau as colleges for young men or for both sexes in 1882, for statistics of 
which, see Table IX of the appendix. Of the 28 all but 3 make report in some form for 
the year. One of the 3 exceptions, Rock River University, Dixon, has not been heard 
from for several years; the other 2, Abingdon College, Abingdon, and Carthage College, 
Carthage, reported for 1881. The remaining 25 continued with but little change the 
‘preparatory, classical collegiate, and scientific collegiate courses that have been noticed 
in preceding years, the preparatory courses ranging from 1 to 3 years; the collegiate gen- 
erally covering 4, though Rock River when last heard from had only 2 in its scientific 
course, and Monmouth only3; Wheaton College, in its philosophical and laureate courses,

\ 
3; Lincoln University, in a ladies’ course, 3. Almost all included 2 or more modern 
languages with their courses in the ancient languages; at least 23 taught music, most of 
them offering also instruction in drawing and painting ; while 16 presented facilities for 
business training and 2 of them for telegraphy also. A few allowed elective courses, but 
did not advise them, and 9 afforded instruction in elocution and voice culture under 
special teachers. Lincoln University had prescribed courses for the degrees of A. M., 
M. S., and M. PH.; Illinois Wesleyan College, courses for graduates and non-residents, 
leading to the degrees of PH. B. and PH. D. 
Eleven of the colleges report for 1881-’82 donations for buildings, current expenses, 
payment of debts, &c., amounting to $227,699. The amount in each case, the names of 
donors, and purpose of gifts may be found in Table XXIII of the appendix. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Twenty-four of the colleges for young men or for both sexes (including the Industrial 
University) offered women substantially the same opportunities for instruction as young 
men. Lincoln University, while opening all its courses to women, offers to such as 
desire it a shorter course of 3 years. 
For women only there were 11 schools reputed to be of collegiate or approximate rank, 
for statistics of which, see Table VIII of the appendix. Of these all but one show pre- 
paratory courses of 1 to 3 years and classical collegiate of 4 years, 4 having also scientific 
courses and the same number adding literary or graduate courses. Instruction in music, 
drawing, painting, and in the French and German languages appears to be offered in 
them all. 3 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Of the 4 colleges that make up the Illinois Industrial University, 3 are distinctively 
scientific: the College of Agriculture, which gives instruction in scientific farming, gar- 
dening, orchard and plant culture, and in the care of farm animals; the College of Engi- 
neering, with schools of mechanical, civil, and mining engineering and architecture ; and 
the College of Natural Science, with schools of chemistry and natural history. There is 
also aschool of military science. The course in each of the 3 colleges covers4 years; thatin 
the school of military science begins with the third term of the freshman year and covers 
2 years. A school of art and design aids the instruction in engineering and_architect- 
ure and affords teachers in the public schools an opportunity to prepare for their school 
work in this direction. A school of domestic science, which existed up to 1880, does not 
appear in the report of 1881 or 1882. 
Of the 28 other colleges in the State for young men or for both sexes all but 4 had 
scientific courses in 1881-82 or slightly different ones entitled philosophical. The Uni- 
versity of Chicago offered also training in astronomy, both to special students and to 
those in the regular collegiate courses, it having a well equipped observatory, with a 
special superintendent and instructor. St. Viateur’s College and Chaddock College 
offered instruction in telegraphy. 
In Chicago a movement was on foot for the establishment of a manual training school 
similar to that of Washington University, St. Louis, Mo., to give young men an oppor- 
tunity for training in the use of tools and in the elements of the industrial sciences. 
A school for supplementing the studies of the public system by instruction in scientific 
agriculture and horticulture for the benefit of farmers’ sons, established in 1868 at Sugar 
Grove, Kane County, by the school authorities of that place, with aid from Mr, Thomas 
Judd, is reported as still continued. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology was taught in 1881-’82 in at least 14 collegiate and theological schools 
with courses of 3 or more years and in at least 4 others with courses of 2 years. These 
figures, however, do not clearly represent the standards of the several schools, as some 
of the 3-year courses followed 5 or 6 years of preparatory and collegiate study, while 
some of four years were preceded by only a small amount of such study. In several 
cases, too, the secular and sacred training went together; in others the latter followed 
the former. The theological department of Jubilee College (Protestant Episcopal) re- 
mained suspended, though plans were on foot for its reopening. Carthage College 
(Lutheran), which had a German theological class of 5 students in 1881, gives no informa- 
tion as to the instruction init in 1882. Lombard University (Universalist) and Wheaton 
College (Wesleyan) instituted theological courses, of 4 years in the former case and 3 in 
the latter, for the year 1881-82. 
For statistics of all these schools, see Table XI of the appendix. 
1Pwo of the schools here referred to—the Chicago Theological Seminary (Congregational) and the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of the Northwest — received in 1881-82 donations amount- 
ing to $119,638. For particulars of these gifts, see Table XXIII of appendix.    
-P-A-G-E-351
ILLINOIS. 57 
Law was taught, as before, in the Bloomington College of Law of Illinois Wesleyan 
University, Bloomington, and in the Union College of Law of the University of Chicago and 
Northwestern University, near by, as well as in the law department of McKendtee Col- 
lege, Lebanon, while Chaddock College, Quincy, instituted for 1881~’82 a law depart- 
ment. In the first 2 and last of these the course covered 2 years of 36 weeks each; at 
McKendree, 2 years of 40 weeks. At the Union College and at Chaddock a fair English 
education was expected of matriculates; at the others there was no requirement on this 
point. f 
For statistics, see Table XII of the appendix. 
Medicine was taught in ‘‘regular’’ schools at the Chicago Medical College (a depart- 
ment of Northwestern University), the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Rush Med- 
ical College, and Woman’s Medical College, all at Chicago.. At a new school, the Quincy 
College of Medicine, also, ‘‘regular”’ instruction was begun in October, 1882. All had 
the common requirements of 3 years’ study under a medical preceptor and of attendance 
on at least 2 annual lecture courses, varying in length from 20 to 24 weeks. All but 
Rush required an examination for admission except where there was evidence of a fair 
English education, and Rush was to require this from 1883. All had graded courses of 
study and desired to have these cover 3 years. 
Of the schools not classified as ‘‘regular,’”’ there were continued the Bennett College 
of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery, the Chicago Homceopathic Medical College, and the 
Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital, all in Chicago. The requirements for gradu- 
ation in the 2 schools first named were similar to those above, but the lecture courses 
were longer, being 26 weeks annually in the first and 29 weeks in the second. In the 
Hahnemann Medical College there were ‘‘ two full lecture courses,” with 26 weeks in 
each year. 
The Chicago College of Pharmacy maintained essentially the same requirements as be- 
fore, namely, 4 years of service in a pharmacy and 2 years’ attendance on the collegiate 
lecture courses of 20 weeks each. 
Yor statistics of all these schools, see Table XIII of the appendix. 
A law of July 1, 1877, requires that in this State all persons desiring to practise medi- 
cine, if not graduates or licentiates of a medical school, shall be examined by the State 
board of health, a certificate of qualification from which board becomes a license. 
Those who possess diplomas of graduation from such schools must present them for 
verification as to their genuineness, and the certificate of the board that the diploma 
is of a satisfactory character renders it a valid license to practise. The certificates given 
are to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county in which the holder resides, and 
a list of such certificates, indicating the persons by whom they are held, is to be always 
kept ready for inspection. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
TRAINING OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Illinois Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Jacksonville, continued 
in 1881-82 its instruction in school studies and in industries that prepare for self sup- 
port to an average of 501 pupils, under 29 teachers, at a cost of $96,538. The number 
under instruction during the year was 550. Large as this number seems, the superin- 
tendent says that it includes only about half of the deaf-mutes in the State. Of the 
graduates of the school, the greater part are said to be doing well in useful and profitable 
occupations, while none have become inmates of jails or almshouses. 
The Chicago Deaf-Mute Day Schools, under the charge of the board of education of the 
city of Chicago, still numbered 5, of which 4 were for comparatively elementary instruc- 
tion and 1 for an advanced class. Instructors, 5; pupils, 57; each present, on an aver- 
age, 139 days. The studies were ‘‘all those of a common school course, with the addi- 
tion of morals and manners.’’ No industries were taught. The articulation method 
was added during the year in the advanced class and one other. 
TRAINING OF THE BLIND. 
The Illinois Institution for the Education of the Blind, Jacksonville, had for 1881-’82 a 
total attendance of 128 pupils. The schoolstudies begin with the alphabet and end with 
geometry. Music is also taught, with such industries as plain and fancy sewing for the 
girls and mattress making, broom making, and chair caning for the boys. The progress 
made, especially in music, is said to compare favorably with that of pupils gifted with 
sight. A large wing was added to the buildingduring theyear. Ordinary expenses for 
the year, $25,447; special, for building, &c., $37,056. 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, Lincoln, aims to promote the intel- 
lectual, moral, and physical culture of this class of unfortunates, fitting them, as far as

possible, to earn a livelihood. The number present September 30, 1881, was 287; new 
pupils admitted during 1881-’82, 77; readmitted, 111; absent, discharged, or died, 173; 
Jeaving 302 present at the clos The cla school studies numbered 11, each com- 
posed of pupils of one sex a >, while there were also classes for calisthenic ex 
for singing, for sewing, and for drawing and painting. The methods of instruction 
appear to be eminently practical, and great success was attained in developing imperfect 
- faculties and awakening dormant intellectual life. Expenses for the year, $70,493.      
            
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
At the Illinois Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home, Normal, there were 317 pupils, under 37 
officers and teachers, in 1881-82, being 8 more than in 1880-’81. The average attend- 
ance was 279; the number of days taught, 192; the grades, 9. During the year 2 pupils 
completed the studies of the ninth grade and a class of 6 was ready to enter on these 
studies at the opening of 1882~’83. Farming, gardening, and housework helped to pre- 
pare the pupils for self support. Expenses of the year, $50,036. 
Besides this State school, 6 others under private or church control, in Addison, Chieago, 
and Quincy, report a total of 682 orphan pupils under the instruction of about 60 teach- 
ers and employés in school studies and domestic industries. Two others, known to 
exist, have made no report. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Illinois State Reform School, Pontiac, had been 11 years in operation at the date 
of the report for 1881~’82, and in that time has had over twelve hundred boys under its 
care, of whom 250 remained on September 30, 1882. The boys received instruction in 
common school studies, in shoemaking, cane seating of chairs, farming, gardening, 
cookery, baking, and kindred employments. Of the beneficial influence of this instruc- 
tion in combination with moral training some striking instances are given. Overerowd- 
ing caused such hinderance to securing good results that a new building to separate the 
younger from the older boys was becoming a necessity. 
The Illinois Industrial School for Girls, Evanston, conducted similarly to the one for 
boys, but a private corporation, had 82 under its care in 1881-82, of whom 26 were sent 
to homes during the year and 56 remained on October 1. Sewing, housework, and cook- 
ery seem to have been the chief industries taught, while school training under a special 
teacher was supplemented by the home influences of a matron and superintendent and 
by moral and religious teaching. 
The Industrial School of the Women’s Christian Home Mission, Peoria, which aims to pre- 
vent pauperism and beggary by giving to the children of the poor instruction in sewing 
and other industries, had 300 such children on its roll in 1881-’82, whom it hoped to in- 
struct eventually in all branches of householdindustry. Great care is taken to inculcate 
good manners and good habits. Singing was taught and pleasant readings were given. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Illinois Training School for Nurses connected with Cook County Hospital, Chi- 
cago, opened for instruction May 1, 1881, had in its first 5 months 8 pupil nurses under © 
training and in charge of 2 hospital wards; in October, 1882, it had 21 in charge of 6 
wards and receiving instruction from the medical staff of the hospital in anatomy, phys- 
iology, materia medica, therapeutics, obstetrics, surgery, electricity, massage, and bath- 
ing. A return of later date indicates 30 pupils and 6 graduates. The physicians and 
surgeons of the hospital testify with great unanimity as to the advantage of having these 
trained pupils in its wards. 
TRAINING IN FINE ARTS, 
Of the instruction given in this direction the information received is very limited, ex- 
tending little beyond the facts that at the schools of the Chieago Academy of Design, 
Academy of Fine Arts, and Society of Decorative Art, as well as at the Hershey School 
of Musical Art, Chicago, and in the East INinois Conservatory of Music, Danville, the 
preceding courses appear to have been continued, while at the State Industrial Univérsity 
and at many of the colleges for young men or for both sexes, as well as in high grade 
schools for young women only, instruction in music, drawing, and painting was provided 
for. Eloeution was taught by specialists in at least 9 colleges, and at Chicago the train- 
ing given by several local teachers was supplemented in the sammer of 1882 by several 
weeks of instruetion by an eminent professor of this art. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
ILLINOIS SOCIETY OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS. 
  This society held its fourteenth annual meeting at Traverse City, Mich., July 3-5, 
1882. It discussed such topics as ‘‘ The responsibility of the teacher for the physical 
development of pupils;’* ‘How can the teacher increase the moral power of his pupils?’”  
-P-A-G-E-353
     
ILLINOIS. 59 
“Free schools the hope of a free people’ ‘Do our schools as now organized and con- 
ducted meet the wants of the times?’ What conclusions were reached the brief reports 
received do not distinctly show. 
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The second annual meeting was to be held at Vandalia, August 30 to September 1, with 
a well arranged programme of topics for discussion. There is no report at hand of the 
debates or the conclusions reached. 
ILLINOIS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-ninth annual session of this body was held, as in 1881, in the legislative hall 
at Springfield, the State capital, December 26-28, 1882. The address of the president, 
Superintendent N. C. Dougherty, of Peoria, was on ‘‘ Needed legislation with respect to 
public schools,’’ which recommended a truant law for cities, provision for well superin- 
tended county institutes, an organized township system of schools to control and improve 
thecommon district system, a better qualified and better paid county superintendency, and 
a fuller arrangement for free libraries as necessary adjuncts of the free schools. The dis- 
cussion of these topics occupied most of the time in the first day’s session and part of the 
succeeding day. The importance of a higher technical training to prepare for a successful 
prosecution of industrial pursuits was also brought forward in an excellent paper by Re- 
gent Peabody, of the State Industrial University, while another by William H. Smith, 
of Peoria, on ‘‘ Education regarding amusements,’’ excited considerable attention. Reso- 
lutions adopted at the close favored more thorough county supervision and a State 
system of county institutes as a most efficient means of aiding the schools at a compara- 
tively small expense; called for laws to enforce the school attendance of truantand vagrant 
children, to substitute the township for the district as the unit for school purposes, and to 
establish and aid district school libraries; advocated township supervision as an effective 
auxiliary to the work of county superintendents; urged generous support of the. Indus- 
trial University as a means of efficient training for important industries; and finally rec- 
ommended that the subjectof healthful and legitimate amusements for the youngshould 
receive careful attention from all teachers. 
Other matters presented were ‘‘School hygiene,’’ by Dr. H. Ziezing; ‘‘ Educational 
ideals, past and present,’’? by L. J. Block; ‘‘Memory in school,’’ by Superintendent 
Howland, of Chicago; ‘‘Historical outline of the progress of education in the United 
States,’’ by Hon. W. H. Wells; and ‘‘ Influence of home on the school,’’ by Miss Sarah 
E. Raymond. 
After the adjournment of the association proper, the county superintendents’ section 
discussed such subjects as ‘‘ Preparing pupils for citizenship,”’ presented by Miss M. A. 
West; ‘‘Grading of country schools,’’ by Superintendent Mastin; and ‘‘ Examination of 
township treasurers’ accounts,’’ by Superintendent A. G. Lane. 
NOTEWORTHY BENEF ACTIONS. 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
It has been mentioned under Superior Instruction that $227,699 were given to col- 
leges in this State in 1881-82. Besides this, it is understood, on what appears to be 
good authority, that subscriptions to theamount of nearly $100,000 were made in Chicago 
towards establishing and equipping a manual training school for the instruction of young 
men in the use of tools, as weil as in the elementary principles of mechanics and of the 
arts that prepare for useful trades. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
DANIEL S. WENTWORTH. 
Thesubject of this sketch was born at Parsonsfield, Me., March 3, 1824, and died at Den- 
ver, Colo., September 16, 1882. Mr. Wentworth was for 30 years a teacher of high repute, 
trained for his work at the Bridgewater Normal School and Phillips Academy, in Massa- 
chusetts. The ability developed in him at these schools, and shown afterwards in four 
years of teaching in the State, in 1854 brought him an invitation to the principalship of 
the Scammon School, Chicago, where he introduced the graded system of instruction 
and helped its introduction in all the public schools. With a brief interval, in which 
he was a member of the Chicago board of education, he was successively at the head of 
two of the most important city schools till 1867, when he organized the Cook County 
Normal School. Bringing to this work high intelligence, great energy, and thorough 
acquaintance with the science of education, he made the new school a remarkable suc- 
cess, training in it great numbers of effective teachers and securing for it a high repu- 
tation. :

60 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SAMUEL H. WHITE. 
Mr. White began his life at Lockport, N. Y., October 7, 1830, and died at Mapleton, Iowa, 
March 9, 1882. When he was in his third year his parents carried him with them to 
Michigan, where, as “he grew up, he made the most of his scanty opportunities of ob- 
taining an education till at 16 he became a teacher, and then, alternately teaching and 
working on his father’s farm, prepared himself for study at the University of Michigan, 
Which he entered in 1852 and graduated from in 1856. Returning to Lotkport, he 
taught in the high school for two years, studying law at, the same time, and then went 
for another yeartothe Albany Law School. Thus equipped, he turned towards the West, 
with an idea of settling in Iowa. But while on his way through Chicago he entered 
an examination of candidates for the principalship of a new school in that city, and 
passed with such success that the city school board offered him the place, which he ac- 
cepted, entering on his work September, 1859. That settled his vocation, and from the 
foremost in the city he soon became one of the foremost teachers in the land. He was 
prominent first in the Principals’ Association of Chicago, then in the State Teachers’ 
Association of Illinois, and finally in the National Educational Association, which last he 
did much to organize in 1870, in its present working form. Two years before this, in 
1868, he had been called from Chicago to organize the Peoria County Normal School, 
and for 11 years he carried it forward with such success as greatly to increase his reputa- 
tion and much improve the quality of teachers, both in the county and elsewhere. But 
continuous work (including editorship of the Illinois Teacher from 1863 to 1871) be- 
gan, at length to tell so greatly upon his health that retirement became necessary. He 
ret tred in 1879, after 20 years devoted to education in Illinois, and sought recuperation 
in change of occupation. But it proved to be too late, and he survived only about three 
years.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
These are a State board of education; a State superintendent of public instruction, who 
is ex officio president of the State board; a county superintendent foreach county; 3school 
trustees for each township, incorporated town, or city, except in cities with 30,000 or 
more inhabitants, which have a school commissioner for each ward; and a director for

each rural school. The membership of the State board includes the governor of the State 
and 7 educational officers named by the law; the State superintendent is elected by the 
people for 2 years; the county superintendents, by the assembled township trustees of 
each County for a like term; the trustees, by the electors in townships, common councils 
in cities, and boards of trustees in incorporated towns, usually for terms of 3 years, with 
partial annual change where they form a board; the director, by the patrons of the schools 
he is to care for. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all unmarried youth of school age as ascertained by an 
annual census. They are sustained from the income of a large common school fund and 
of the congressional township school fund, a State tax of 16 cents on each $100 of tax- 
able property and 50 cents on each taxable poll, and the income from licenses for the sale 
of intoxicating liquors and from unclaimed fees, all which, without deduction for expense 
of collection, must be used for the payment of teachers. In incorporated towns there 
may be also levied a special tax, not to exceed 30 cents on each $100, for support of town 
schools. For school-houses, furniture, apparatus, and fuel, a special tax is authorized 
in townships, towns, and cities with less than 30,000 people, not to exceed 50 cents on 
$100 of property and $1 on each poll in any year; but in cities of 30,000 or more inhabit- 
ants it must not, for the same purpose, exceed 25 cents on each $100 for buildings, &c., 
or the same amount for payment of teachers. For the support of free libraries in connec- 
tion with the common schools in cities of 30,000 or more inhabitants a tax not to exceed 
+ of a mill on the dollar and in any township where there has been or may be by private 
donation a library worth $1,000 a tax not to exceed 1 cent on $100 may be levied. 
The trustees of two or more adjacent counties or townships may establish a new dis- 
trict when in their judgment it shall appear necessary. Trustees may establish graded 
schools, or any modification of them, and joint graded schools may be established by 
school trustees of two or more municipal corporations. To be employed, teachers 
must possess a State, county, or city license, covering 6, 12, 18, or 24 months, which may 
be revoked for incompete: immorality, cruelty, or general neglect of the business of 
the school. At the close of each term of school, teachers must make to the proper trustee 
a full report of the required data, verified by affidavit, not more than 75 per cent. of their 
wages being paid them until such report shall have been filed. They are also required 
to attend the township institutes or forfeit 1 day’s pay for each day’s absence not due 
to sickness. 
Separate schools for colored children may be established, with all the rights, privileges, 
and advantages of other public schools; but where no such schools exist colored children 
may attend the schools for whites. Any youth attending a colored school, on showing 
sufficient advancement, must be placed in a higher grade, and no distinction is to be made 
on account of race or color. German may be taught at the request of the parents or 
guardians of 25 or more children attending a public school. The Bible must not be ex- 
eluded from the public schools. Women are eligible to school offices.— (School law, 1877, 
and general laws. )     
    
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As will be seen from the foregoing summary, the statistics of 1881-’82 compared with 
those of 1880-’81 indicate a general falling off in all important items except the number 
of school-houses, valuation of school property, income and expenditure, and the amount 
of the common school fund. State Superintendent Bloss offers no explanation in his re- 
port of the figures indicating so general a decrease, but he says that during his term of 
office, thus far, he has found much to commend and few things to condemn in the work- 
ing of the school system; what he cannot commend he finds in the administration rather 
than in the system. He regards the organization of the schools as accomplished; the 
schools in cities and towns have been graded, those of townships have been classified, and 
in many counties they have reached a fair standard of gradation. More attention was 
given to the mental, moral, and physical education of the children; more thought to 
methods and subjects of instruction; greater efforts were made to train pupils to think 
for themselves; more attention was given to the formation of character and the inculca- 
tion of good habits. These things he regards as the true evidences of progress. He has 
aimed to lessen the defects in the working of the system by holding the county superin- 
tendents and school trustees stricily to their duties and has sought to improve the schools 
by improving the teachers. While Indiana has a fair proportion of good teachers, com- 
pared with other States, the superintendent thinks a very large number of them are not 
well fitted for their work. Still, the fact that, while 63,853 applied for licenses, 23,317 
were rejected shows some care in the admission of teachers. Of the 13,259 now in the 
field, he says only a part have attended a normal school, college, or university, and com- 
paratively few were graduates of any of these institutions. 
As showing the need of fuller schooling, a table taken from the census and embodied    
-P-A-G-E-357
  INDIANA. 63 
in his report shows that of the population of the State of 10 years of age and upwards 
in 1880 4.8 per cent. could not read and 7.5 per cent. could not write; of whites 7 per 
cent. and of colored 35.6 per cent. could not write.— (State report.) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
One of the Kindergiirten reporting from Indianapolis was reported in 1882 as closed, 
the teacher, Miss A. Steiger, being engaged in one of the public schools with a view to 
introducing the system. For statistics of others reporting, see Table V of the appendix. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS, 
These are a superintendent ; a board of three school trustees, elected for 3-year terms 
by the common council of each city, with partial annual change ; and, in cities of 30,000 
or more inhabitants, a board of school commissioners holding office for three years, with 
annual change of part of its membership.— (School law.)

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. : 
Evansville, reporting for 1881—’82 an increase of 822 youth of school age, still enrolled 
only about 40 per cent. of the school population; 78.7 per cent. of the enrolment were 
in average daily attendance.— (State report. ) 
Fort Wayne, with 9 public school buildings (3,972 sittings), provided for only about 
28 per cent. of the school population; adding 3,600 sittings in private and parochial schools, 
only 53 per cent. had school accommodations. School property was valued at $227,500. 
While school population and enrolment slightly increased, there was a small decrease in 
average daily attendance. Of the 3,200 in private and parochial schools, about 2,200 
were in average daily attendance, occupying 16 buildings, with 3,600 sittings for study. 
The public schools were in session 192 days. Special teachers in music, drawing, and 
* penmanship were employed.— (Return. ) 
Indianapolis in 1881-’82 had 29 school buildings, with sittings for 10,755, only a frac- 
tion more than one-third of the school children. These buildings, with other school 
property, were valued at $920,137. While there was an increase of 1,919 in school pop- 
ulation, of 504 in enrolment, and of 445 in average daily attendance, 13 fewer teachers were 
employed, with an increase of $27,517 in expenditure. For music and drawing there 
were special teachews. Only 43.13 per cent. of school population were enrolled in the 
public schools; and, if to this be added 1,053 in private and parochial schools, it shows 
only 46.55 per cent. in school.— (Return.) 
From Jeffersonville the only three items of school statistics reported for 1881—’82 show 
a gain of 286 in school population over the previous year, of 109 in enrolment, and of 97 
in average daily attendance. Only 46.4 per cent. of the children of school age were in 
the public schools during the year, while 72.2 per cent. of the enrolment was in average 
daily attendance.— (State report, 1882.) 
La Fayette reported for 1881—’82 only three items of school statistics, which show an 
increase of 166 in school population, of 18 in enrolment, and of 4 in average daily attend- 
ance, enrolling during the year only 45 per cent. of its school children and having only 
53.7 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance.— (State report. ) 
Logansport in 1881~’82 had 6 school buildings, with 1,660 sittings, school property being 
valued at $145,900, This provides public school room for 42.3 per cent. of the school pop-

and parochial schools.— (Return. ) - 
Madison reported 7 public school buildings, with 29 rooms for work, valued, with other 
school property, at $81,000. There was a falling off of 1,425 in school population and a 
decrease of 219 in average daily attendance, of 7 in teachers, and of $3,396 in expenditure. 
Its enrolment shows not quite 39 per cent. of its children of school age in the public 
schools; there were 750 in private and parochial schools. Schools were taught 196 of the 
200 school days.— (Return. ) 
New Albany reported only 46 per cent. of its school population as enrolled and 69 per 
cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance.— (State report. ) 
Richmond presents a full report, showing 10 public school buildings, with 51 rooms and 
2,045 sittings. The 8 owned by the city and other school property were valued at $103,350. 
‘There were 46 schools, employing 50 teachers and 2 specialists in music and German. 
The enrolment exceeded that of last year by 131; the average daily attendance was 80 
more; the public school enrolment was only 46.19 per cent. of the school population. 
There were 700 in private and parochial schools.— (City report and return. ) 
South Bend reports an increase of 542 in school population over 1880-81, of 140 in en- 
rolment, and of 175 in average daily attendance, this attendance being 69.47 per cent. of 
enrolment. The 7 school buildings, which furnished abundant sittings in the previous 
year, were insufficient in 1881-’82. With the rapid increase of school population addi- 
tional school rooms were imperatively called for; school property increased in value from 
$131,350 to $134,000. The schools are classed as primary, lower and upper interme- 
diate, grammar, and high, the course covering 12 years, giving 2 years to each lower de- 
partment and 4 to the high, in which German may be substituted for Latin throughout 
the course, no Greek being required.— (City report and return. ) 
Terre Haute, to provide foran increase of 849 in school population, of 206 in enrolment, 
and of 131 in average daily attendance over 1880-’81, added 4 roomsto one of its 11 school 
buildings, making in all 73 roomsfor both recitation and study and 13 for recitation only, 
with 3,900 sittings; school property was valued at $229,930. The full course covers 12 
years, music and drawing, with instruction in good behavior, coming in each year below 
the high school, which has a 4-year course, in which Greek iselective. German, if 
elected, begins in the third year of the district schools or in the first year of the high 
school, and is taught by special teachers, while Latin is also elective in the first 3 years 
of the high school course. The work of the high school was satisfactory, the enrolment 
being up to that of former years and the average attendance better. The publicschools 
enrolled only 47 per cent. of the school population.— (City report and return.) 
Vincennes reported 4 school buildings and 20 rooms for both study and recitation, with 
854 sittings. School property was valued at $44,500. There was an increase of 102 in 
enrolment, of 30 in average attendance, and of 2 in teachers. Special teachers in music 
and German were employed. There were sittings for only 22 percent. of youth of school 
age. Including 700 in private and parochial schools, 49 per cent. of the school population 
was enrolled.— (Return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Indiana State Normal School, Terre Haute, prepares young men of 18 and young, 
women of 16 for work in the public schools. To enter, all pupils must have at least 
a fair knowledge of common branches and a reputation for good moral character. It pre- 
sents 3 courses of study: one of three years, for those needing a knowledge of the subjects 
to he taught, as well as of approved methods of teaching them; another, of 2 years, for 
persons of better education or of some experience in teaching, who need a closer insight 
into the principles and practice of effective teaching; a third, of 1 year, for college grad- 
uates and other high grade students who wish to study the philosophy of teaching and 
the best means of imparting knowledge. All that enter these courses are pledged to 
teach in the State schools twice as long as they attend the normal school, if practicable. 
To aid and illustrate the training given there is a practice department of about 200 pupils, 
under 4 critic teachers, and every student in the theory department is expected to spend 
from 1 to 3 hours daily in observing the work done in the practice schools, in teaching 
in them, or in some study relating to such work. The number of regular professors, 
besides the critic teachers above mentioned, was 12 in 1881-’82; the number of different 
normal pupils, 529; graduates for the year, 30, all engaged in teaching. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Indianapolis Normal School and the Training Department of Public Schools, Fort 
Wayne, continued to give instruction in the work of teaching, with practice in model 
schools, granting diplomas on completion of required courses. The former, with a course 
of 1} years, had 1 instructor and 39 students, graduating 19, who all engaged in teaching; 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
  
INDIANA. 65 
the latter, requiring 1 year of study after the high school, had 3 instructors and 9 stu- 
dents, all graduated and engaged to teach. Two opened in 1882: (1) the Elkhart Nor- 
mal School, with 10 instructors, 23 normal and 19 other students, and a 2-year course; 
(2) the Kindergarten Normal Training Department of the Hadley and Roberts Academy, 
Indianapolis, with a 2-year course, 2 instructors, and 4 students, all engaged to teach in 
1883. Normal training, in some cases separate from the regular course, in others con- 
nected with it, appears in the latest catalogues of a number of the colleges and univer- 
sities. 
The 5 private schools reported in 1880-81, with large rewards for short courses, show 
no changes in 1881-’82. These are the Central Normal College, Danville; the Central 
Indiana Normal School, Ladoga; the Southern Indiana Normal College, Mitchell; the 
Southern Indiana Normal School, Paoli; and the Northern Indiana Normal School, Val- 
paraiso. The last reported, for 1881-82, 2,910 normal students, against 2,100 the previous 
year. For statistics of others reporting, see Table III of the appendix. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
According to the law requiring teachers’ institutes to be held in each county of the 
State at least-once a year and in townships at least one Saturday of each month, 90 
county and 4,299 township institutes were held in 1882. Of private normal institutes, 
101 were reported as held, under 255 instructors, with 4,809 attendants. 
These institutes are regarded as a most important factor in the school system, giving 
larger returns than any other local expenditure. To aid the instructors, the State board 
of education prepared outlines of the work in the county institutes to be held in 1881 
and 1882. The State superintendent says that no work of the board has done more for 
the cause of education in so short atime or prepared the way for grander results for 
the future. During 1882 he visited 63 institutes, spending 1 day or more in each and 
delivering 160 addresses to teachers and the public in 78 different counties. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Indiana School Journal, Indianapolis, the organ of the State superintendent, 
began its twenty-seventh volume in June, 1882, continuing through the year. School 
Education, Terre Haute, which began its second volume December, 1880, appears to have 
suspended. The Normal Teacher, Danville, began its fourth volume in March, 1881, 
but the numbers necessary to complete the volume not having been received it is sup- 
posed to have suspended. The Normal News, also published at Danville, continued its 
publication through 1882 in quarterly numbers. t 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of high schools is not reported, because not expressly provided for in the 
State law. They are, however, recognized by the State University and the State board 
of education under an arrangement which admits certified graduates of approved high 
schools without examination into the freshman classes of the State and Purdue Univer- 
sities. Such graduates are also admitted in the State Normal School to advanced stand- 
ing, by which they are enabled to complete the whole course in 2 years. Thirty-four 
such schools were commissioned for the school year 1881-82. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For detailed statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory 
schools, and preparatory departments of universities and colleges, see Tables IV, VI, 
VU, IX, and X of the appendix; for a summary of their statistics, see corresponding 
tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Indiana University, Bloomington, waives the admission examination of graduates (of 
either sex) of approved high schools. Other candidates may beexamined by any county 
superintendent who holds a commission from the university for that purpose. In all 
such cases the questions are prepared and the answers examined and graded by the 
university. All other applicants must be examined on the studies of the university’s 
preparatory course of 2 years, the entrance examination being the same for all courses. 
The student on admission has his choice between three collegiate courses, one in ancient 
classics, leading to the degree of A. B.; one in modern classics, leading to the degree of 
LIT. B.; the other in science, leading to the degree of s. B, These courses are the same 
in extent and value, each requiring 4 years for its completion, and in culture and mental 
discipline they are as nearly equivalent as possible.

  66 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Catalogues of other universities and of colleges for 1882 show no material changes in 
the amount and character of their work since 1880-81. The following continued their 
full classical, scientific, or philosophical courses of 4 years each, with preparatory courses 
of 2 and 3 years: Butler, Hartsville, Indiana Asbury, and Notre Dame Universities and 
Concordia, Earlham, Franklin, Hanover, Moore’s Hill, Ridgeville, Union Christian, and 
Wabash Colleges. Franklin and Wabash had also English courses. Ft. Wayne, Moore’s 
Hill, Notre Dame, St. Meinrad’s, and Union Christian gave commercial training; Earl- 
ham, Ft. Wayne, Hartsville, Moore’s Hill, Ridgeville, and Union Christian gave some 
normal training; all but Wabash and St. Meinrad’s, instruction in music; 4 taught draw- 
ing and painting; all but 2 taught modern languages, while 7 gave ministerial training. 
‘Two universities have law courses of 2 years, and 2, medical coursesof the same length, 
for which, see next page. 
Ft. Wayne College does not attempt a full collegiate course. Though chartered as a 
college, it is thought best at present to do only academic and preparatory work, hop- 
ing with the increase of funds to be able to enlarge the course of study.— (Catalogue. ) 
For statistics of colleges, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of their statis- 
tics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the 15 institutions for young men heretofore mentioned, 11.admit women on equal 
terms with men, while Purdue University, noted below, has from the first been open 
for the liberal education of women. Of those for young women only, the Moravian Sem- 
inary, Hope, was closed in 1882, and the Female College of Indiana, Greencastle (Pres- 
byterian), has not reported for several years. The only definite information for 1882 is 
therefore from De Pauw College for Young Women, New Albany (Methodist Episcopal), 
and from St. Mary’s Academic Institute, St. Mary’s (Roman Catholic), the former with 
preparatory and collegiate courses of fair grade, in which were 45 preparatory students 
and 40 collegiate, besides 45 others, all under 8 instructors; the latter with courses less 
defined, in which were 148 pupils of all grades, under 25 teachers. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIO. 
The Indiana University and 11 other colleges offered scientific instruction to some 
extent in 1881-82. " 
Purdue University, La Fayette, was the only institution devoted exclusively to tech- 
nical training. Such instruction was given in 3 departments: (1) the college of gen- 
eral science, with 3 general courses of 4 years each, scientific, agricultural, and mechan- 
ical; (2) six special schools: (a) school of agriculture and horticulture, 4 years; (0) 
school of mechanics, 2 years; (¢c) industrial art, 4 years, 2 given to industrial design and 
2 to mechanical drawing; (d) school of chemistry, 3 years; (e) school of natural his- 
tory, 4 years, 2 years each given to botany and zodlogy; (f 5 school of mechanical and 
civil engineering, reorganized in 1882; and (3) the university academy course of 2 years, 
which prepares students for admission to the college of general science and provides in- 
struction in the higher common school branches for those not able to take a more ex- 
tended course. Women are admitted on equal terms with men. Instructionin military 
tactics is given in three drills a week, under an officer detailed by the War Department. 
Under 13 instructors, including the president, there were 238 students (excluding dupli- 
cate enrolments), 129 in academy, 61 in special courses, and 99 in college. 
Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, founded by the late Chauncey Rose, was to be 
opened March 8, 1883, adding much to the means of scientific training in the State. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—Theology was taught in 1881-’82, mainly, as in previous years, as a mere 
auxiliary to university and college courses, with but slight changes since 1880-81. The 
exceptions, as before, were in Union Christian College, Merom (Christian), and St. Mein- 
rad’s College (Roman Catholic), both having special theological courses of 3 years 
each. In the biblical department of Butler College, Irvington (Christian); in that of 
Indiana Asbury University, Greencastle (Methodist Episcopal); and probably in connec- 
tion with the elective Hebrew in Moore’s Hill College, Moore’s Hill (Methodist Episco- 
pal), and of Notre Dame University, Notre Dame (Roman Catholic), some instruction 
was given in aid of those designing to enter the work of the ministry. Concordia Col- 
lege, Fort Wayne (Evangelical Lutheran), continued to prepare students for the Practical 
Preachers’ Seminary, at Springfield, Il., and Evangelical Lutheran Seminary, at St. 
Louis, Mo. 
For statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of the appendix.

INDIANA. 67 
Legal.—The University of Notre Dame in 1881-82 continued its law department with 
3 professors, giving no statement of attendance. For admission to its 2-year course, a 
complete English education was expected and a classical training wasadvised. Students 
must pass an examination at the close of each term and present an essay on some prac- 
tical topic. For graduation, proof must be given of proficiency in rhetoric, English 
literature, and logic, as well as inlaw. Indiana Asbury University, during the year, 
organized a department of law, under a faculty of 5 professors, with a class of 12 stu- 
dents for the first year. 
Medical.—Medical instruction was given in 1881-’82, as in 1880-’81, by the following 
“yegular’? schools: Medical College of Evansville; Medical College of Fort Wayne (not 
to be confounded with the Fort Wayne College of Medicine, which remained under the 
ban of the American Medical College Association); Medical College of Indiana, Indian- 
apolis; and the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, Indianapolis. 
The Medical College of Fort Wayne and the Central College, Indianapolis, lengthened 
their lecture courses, the former to 24 weeks, the latter to 21. Both offered (though with- 
out requiring it) a graded 3-year course. 
Central Normal College, Danville, Northern Indiana Normal School, Valparaiso, and 
Notre Dame University announce courses preparatory to entering the regular medical 
schools. 
The Indiana Eclectic Medical School, Indianapolis, continued its teaching in 1881-82, 
graduating 7 students from a 2-year course of 20 weeks each year. 
Dental.—The Indiana Dental College, Indianapolis, continued its instruction in 1881-82 
with increased facilities. As heretofore, it required 2 years of preparatory work and an 
entrance examination in common school studies when necessary. ‘The course of training 
of 1, 2, or more years covered 5 months each year and an examination was required at its 
close. Women as well as men are admitted. Professors and instructors for the year, 11; 
graduated at its close, 15 
For statistics of medical and dental schools, see Table XIII of the appendix; for a sum- 
mary of them, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES. 
The Indiana Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Indianapolis, had 
in 1882 a total of 374 pupils, 201 of them males and 173 females, under 18 instructors, of 
whom 4 were deaf-mutes and 5 semi-mutes; 83 of the pupils also were deaf-mutes, Of 
the 374 pupils for the year, 324 remained December 1, 1882. Whole number instructed 
from the beginning, 1,451. ‘The instruction included common school studies, cabinet 
making, chair caming, and shoemaking for boys, with household industries for the 
girls. A library of 3,172 volumes aided and supplemented the instruction given, which 
combined the manual and oral methods. Valuation of buildings and grounds, $457,510; 
expenditures for the year: for support, $52,819; for buildings, $2,982. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
Indiana Institute for the Education of the Blind, Indianapolis, reported for 1881-’82 
10 teachers and 14 other employés, 4 of the last mentioned being blind, with 128 
pupils. The common and high school branches are taught, and an additional 3-year 
course is given those who can advance so far. Special attention is devoted to music and 
piano-tuning. All are taught handicrafts; the girls, beadwork, sewing by hand and 
machine, crocheting, cutting and fitting dresses; the boys, broom making. The health 
of the inmates was good and satisfactory progress was made in the different depart- 
ments. There had been 700 admitted since the opening. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, near Knightstown, reported a decreased en- 
rolment in 1881-82, but the same number of instructors and other employés. Since 
opening (in 1879) 9 had been dismissed as improved. ‘The children are taught reading, 
writing, simple numbers, music, and light gymnastics. Income from the State, $10,000. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS.       
The Indiana Soldiers’ Orphan Home, near Knightstown, is under the same general super- 
vision as the above, both being State institutions. Children to be admitted must be 
under 15 years of age, and on reaching that age have homes in good families provided 
for them. The older boys work on the farm. In school, reading, writin: arithmetic, 
drawing, and vocal music are attended to. Number of officers, teachers, and assistants 
in 1881~’82, 8; pupils, 154; pupils since opening, 1,232; State appropriation, $24,000.

  68 REPORT 'OF' THE’ COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Asylum, Terre Haute, and St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum and Manual Labor School, Rensse- 
laer (Roman Catholic), are for girls, and teach domestic duties, knitting, sewing by hand 
and machine, and in school a common education, with music. They provide good homes 
for the younger and prepare the older ones to earn their own living. The former had 
151 inmates, and 978 since opening; the latter, 42, and 358 since opening. The others 
are (1) the Jeffersonville Orphan Home, Jeffersonville (non-sectarian), supported by alocal 
association; (2) the Wernle Orphan Home, Richmond, supported by the Evangelical 
Lutheran Synod of that and other States, which admits children 2 to 14 years of age, and 
teaches reading, writing, arithmetic, and music, girls being also taught to knit, sew, and 
do general housework, and boys to do farm and garden work; and (3) the Hamilton County 
Children’s Home, Westfield, supported by the county, which admits children 2 to 16 
years of age, gives a common education, with instruction in housework, laundry, needle 
and fancy needle work, and in farming, and at suitable age provides homes or employ- 
ments. 
Besides these are the Richmond Orphan Asylum, Richmond, and the Indianapolis 
Orphan Asylum, Indianapolis, from which no returns have come in. 
FREE KINDERGARTEN. 
During 1882, the Indianapolis Benevolent Society opened 2 free Kindergarten in parts 
of the city where large numbers of destitute families were found. Under the teachings 
of experienced and devoted instructors the results were so happy that the public promptly 
met the expenses, and this beginning was to be followed by thé opening of others. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Flower Mission Cottage Hospital and Training School for Nurses, Indianapolis, 
begins its work in a 2-year course under a head nurse from Bellevue Hospital, New 
York. Work will be found in the hospital for 6 pupil nurses. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Busy Bee, Richmond (Friends), gathers poor and idle children over 4 years of 
age, teaches them to sew, knit, work on cardboard, &c., and is supported by contribu- 
tions. It had 22 female teachers and 105 pupils. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Reformatory Institution, for women and girls, Indianapolis, had penal and reform- 
atory departments under State control at a cost in 1882 of $28,000, and earned in that 
year by its industries $2,600. In the reformatory department children must be under 16 
years of age to be admitted. During 1881-’82, 51 were committed, 61 discharged, and 
144 retained. The inmates were in school one-half of the day and were taught the com- 
mon branches. The industrial training included cane seating, laundry work, sewing, 
and all domestic employments. Of those gone out during the year, 88 per cent. were 
doing well, while of all released from the beginning 82 per cent. are known to have be- 
come useful members of society. Whole number committed since establishment, 492.— 
(Report and return. ) 
Indiana Reform School for Boys, Plainfield, is a State institution, and in 1882 cost 
$16,125, an average of $120 for each inmate. Boys are admitted between 10 and 17 and 
are taught the common English branches. They are also trained in farming, gardening, 
tailoring, carpentry, chair caning, shoemaking, and laundry work. During the year, 
177 being committed and 183 released, there were 372 inmates, 16 more than the preced- 
ing year. The parents of nearly all were illiterate, and many of the oldest inmates, 
when committed, had never been at school. Their progress while in the institution was 
generally rapid. Since the opening 1,718 had been committed, and 95 per cent. of those 
honorably discharged were known to have become useful citizens,— (Report and return.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
This body held its annual session at Indianapolis, June 20 and 21, with superintend- 
ents present from 58 counties. The meeting is said to have been one of the largest and 
most profitable ever held. Mr. Nowles, of Jasper County, chairman of a committee on 
a ‘system of graduation from district schools,’’ reported for the committee, recommend- 
ing that diplomas or certificates of proficiency be given to pupils who shall have com- 
pleted the course of study in district schools and suggesting a plan for the accomplishment 
of this purpose. There is no record of any action taken on this report.— (Indiana School

STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body met in its twenty-ninth annual session at Indianapolis, Tuesday, December 
26, 1882, and was called to order by the retiring president, H. B. Jacobs, who in a brief 
address insisted that good teaching does not consist in teaching many things but in 
teaching a few things well. Superintendent H.S. Tarbell, president elect, on taking the 
chair, delivered an admirable address on the ‘* Relation of the imagination to educational 
work.’? . 
The first paper read on Wednesday morming was by W. F. Yocum, president of Fort 
Wayne College, on ‘‘ Relative values of discipline and instruction in the public schools,”’ 
which was discussed by Edward Taylor, of Vincennes; Dr. Brown and Michael Seiler, of the 
State Normal School; and W. A. Bell and J. M. Strasburg, of Richmond. There was pre- 
sented a petition prepared by the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, to be signed 
and presented to the legislature, asking it to authorize the teaching of temperance in the 
public schools. Miss Lida D. Hadley, of Richmond, then read a paper on ‘‘ Essentials 
in education,’’ such as care of health, good primary training, pleasant moral influences, 
and judiciously planned coursesof instruction. The discussion of this subject was opened. 
by D. W. Thomas, of Wabash, in a well prepared paper, who was followed by Timothy 
Wilson in a short paper on the same subject. In the afternoon there was a carefully 
prepared paper on ‘‘ Psychology and the preceptor,”” by Howard Sanderson, of the State 
Normal School. In opening the discussion, Professor Study, of Greencastle, said that the 
teacher should know the mind intrusted to him for development, but of this he feared 
the great mass of teachers almost entirely ignorant. Dr. E. E. White, of Purdue, said 
that the importance of a knowledge of the human mind must be conceded by all. He 
was glad the normal school had taken hold of this work, and hoped that the science of 
education would be so formulated that teachers might have something to study on this 
subject. Jesse H. Brown gave an exercise to explain drawing as taught in the Indianap- 
olis schools, and Prof. L. S. Thompson, of Purdue, then presented some forms of it for use 
in country schools. At the evening session an address was delivered by Dr. Moss, presi- 
dent of the State University, on ‘‘Education and the Commonwealth.”’ 
At the morning session of the third day Mrs. L. D. Cunningham, of Madison, read a 
paper on ‘Cultivation of the powers of expression.”” After discussion of this paper 
Charles F. Coffin, superintendent of schools of New Albany, read a paper on ‘‘ Teaching 
thrift in the public schools.’’ This paper was discussed by Superintendent J. M. Bloss, 
Prof. Amzi Atwater of the State University, Prof. L. S. Thompson, and Dr. J. 8. Irwin 
of Fort Wayne. In the afternoon William A. Bell, of the Indiana State Journal, read 
a paper on “ Recent criticisms on public schools.’ 
The usual officers and committees for the ensuing year were appointed and resolu- 
tions adopted, after which the association adjourned. ‘There was an attendance of about 
500 and a membership of 214, of whom 42 werenew members.— (Indiana School Journal, 
February, 1883.) 
SOUTHERN INDIANA TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body held its fifth annual meeting at Connersville, March 29, 1882. Several able 
papers were read and discussed, which, for want of space, cannot be fully noted in this 
report. Itis said to have been one of the largest and most enthusiastic meetings ever 
held.— (Indiana School Journal, May, 1882.) 
INDIANA COLLEGE ASSOCIATION, 
This association held its fifth annual session at Indianapolis, December 26 and 27, 1882, 
the following universities and colleges being represented: Indiana, Indiana Asbury, But- 
ler, Purdue, and Hartsville Universities and Hanover, Wabash, Franklin, and Earlham 
Colleges. 
Prof H. W. Wiley, of Purdue, read the opening paper, on ‘‘The disciplinary value of 
the study of the natural sciences,’’ the discussion of which was opened by Prof. D. S. 
Jordan, in a paper on ‘‘ The disciplinary value of the natural sciences.” 
Next came ‘‘The schools of the United States,’’ from the president, D. W. Fisher, of 
Hanover College. The idea, he said, of a single organic whole, with the perfect articu- 
lation of a living creature, with no loss of time in the transition from one department 
to another, and friction at a minimum, has, in a large degree, been realized in our school 
system. But we must not refuse to see defects. Law and medical schools admit on too 
low astandard. The State should require a diploma of a chartered college as the lowest 
standard of admission. Of colleges we have none too many—only about 400. The fault 
with us is in a lack of means to do the work as it should be done in the time allotted 
to it. Weare trying to do too much for the time. The high schools are the most 
important representatives of secondary instruction. There is need of them as the 
feeders of colleges, and they should have a uniform course. As to our intermediate and 
primary schoo:s, we may be proud of them. ‘The one defect in our whole system is lay-

  ing too much stress on breadth and too little on depth and thoroughness. Yet with all 
the deficiencies, we need not be ashamed to submit our school system to the scrutiny of 
the world as one of the grandest features of our civilization. 
Then came a paper on ‘ Disciplinary value of philological study,’? by Professor Amzi 
Atwater, which was discussed at great length and was followed by an able paper on 
“College discipline,’ read by Dr. Lemuel Moss, defining discipline as having reference 
to conduct and character rather than to scholarship. : . 
Dr. W. T. Stott, from the committee on degrees, reported that the association rec- 
ommend to the colleges to make the amount of work necessary for the degrees of B. s. 
and B. PH. equal to that necessary for A. B., to give the second degree in course only 
upon application of the candidate and upon evidence of scholarly habits and activity, 
and to give the degree of PH. D. only upon satisfactory examination. 
Prof. J. W. Moncrief then read the closing paper on ‘‘The place of American liter- 
ature in the college courses.” 
Officers for the ensuing year having been elected, the association adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent, elected for two years, has general supervision of the public 
schools. A law of 1 ated a State board for the examination of teachers, to consist 
of the superintendent, the president of the State University, the principal of the State 
Normal School, and two persons, one of whom must be a woman, to be appointed by the 
executive council. Each county has a school superintendent ; each township and inde- 
pendent district, a board of directors ; and each subdistrict into which a township may be 
divided, a subdirector, the subdirectors of the subdistricts forming a district township 
poard. Women are eligible to any school office in the State.      
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
  Public schools must be taught in each subdistrict for at last 120 days in the year and 
are free to all resident youth of school age. They are sustained from the income of a
-P-A-G-E-366
72 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
State school fund, from county taxes of 1 to 3 mills on $1, and from district taxes notto 
exceed 10 mills on $1 for a school-house fund and $5 a pupil for a contingent fund. Be- 
sides common schools the system includes high schools, a State Normal School, teachers’ 
institutes, a State university, agricultural college, reform school, institutions forthe blind, 
the deaf and dumb, and the feeble-minded. Teachers, to be legally employed, must have 
certificates of qualification. They must keep a register and make annual reports to the 
board of directors, which, in turn, reports to the county superintendent, and he to the 
State superintendent. 
ADDITIONAL SCHOOL LAWS. 
The legislature at its session in 1882 provided that boards of directors of each district, 
township, and independent district should cause to be set out at least twelve shadetrees 
on each school-house site belonging to the district, in case so many were not already 
growing. It was made the duty of the county superintendent to see that this provision 
was complied with. It provided also that boards of directors of district townships 
should be authorized to obtain at the expense of the district township such highways 
for proper access to their school-houses as they might deem proper, and to use unappro- 
priated contingent funds to effect insurance on the school property of their districts; 
that county superintendents should have $4 instead of $3 for every day necessarily en- 
gaged in the performance of official duties, and that they might visit the different 
schools of their counties in their discretion, and must, at the request of the majority of 
the directors of a district, visit the school in said district at least once each term; and, 
finally, that there should be a State board of examiners for teachers desiring certificates 
of qualification good throughout the State. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
‘The printed reports of public education being biennial in this State and the last one 
being for 1880-’81, no information as to the condition of the public schools can be pre- 
sented beyond what may be drawn from the above summary of statistics, which was pre- 
pared from figures kindly furnished by the State superintendent. 
It appears that, with 10,009 more youth of school age in the State, there were 24,566 
fewer pupils enrolled in public schools, the average attendance also decreasing, but in 
much smaller proportion; the ratio of average attendance to the number enrolled in- 
creased 3.5 per cent. The average school term was 6 days shorter. More teachers were 
employed, and their average pay was slightly greater. More money was received and 
expended for school purposes; the permanent fund increased by over $185,000 and the 
estimated value of public school property by nearly $450,000. 
KINDERGARTEN, 
' Kindergarten instruction has been given in Cedar Rapids since 1877; in Des Moines, 
since 1876; in Manchester, since 1878; and in September, 1882, a Kindergarten was or- 
ganized at Council Bluffs in connection with the public school system. West Des 
Moines introduced Kindergarten instruction the spring previous. For statistics of these 
schools reporting, see Table V of the appendix, and for a summary, see the report ofthe 
Commissioner preceding. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Public schools are controlled by boards of school directors, numbering 6 members in 
cities of more than 500 population, and in smaller cities 3 members. City superintend- 
ents, appointed by the board, are generally employed.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The Cedar Rapids public schools, comprising primary, grammar, and high grades, with 
12 years in all, were taught 178 days, in 9 school buildings having 38 rooms for study 
and capable of accommodating 2,024 pupils. About 300 attended private and parochial 
schools. 
Clinton reports 32 public schools, primary, grammar, and high, taught for 184 days 
in 6 buildings valued, with other school property, at about $75,150. Besides the public 
school attendancenoted above, Clinton had about 300 pupils in private or parochial schools. 
The Council Bluffs public schools were taught 194 days in12school buildings. The en- 
rolment reported above includes children 5 yearsold, who were taught in a Kindergarten. 
Davenport had 73 public schools, including primary, grammar, high, city normal, and 
evening schools, the day schools being taught 193 days in 13 school buildings. Value 
of all school property, about $291,000.. There were 1,200 pupils enrolled in private and 
parochial schools. 
Dubuque reports her public schools (primary, grammar, and high) taught for 198 days 
in 9 school buildings, which afforded accommodation for 3,550 pupils. ‘Therewere 2,620 
pupils attending private and parochial schools. 
In Keokuk public schools were taught for 186 days in 8 school buildings. Value of 
all school property, about $100,000. Besides the public school enrolment shown in the 
above table there were about 300 pupils in private and parochial schools. 
Ottumwa reports 26 public schools, taught for 187 days in 3 buildings valued, with 
other school property, at $65,150, and a private school enrolment of about 200. 
West Des Moines reported her public schools as taught for 187 days in 6 school build- 
ings, valued, with other school property, at- $247,500. The year was one of marked 
progress in school affairs, the enrolment increasing by 400, more than double the increase 
of the last year, a new building necessary to accommodate this increase being added and 
a training school for teachers established. The course of study begins with a year of 
Kindergarten work and includes beyond that 3 primary years, 4 grammar, and 4 high. 
A special effort was made to increase the practical efficiency of the schools. In arithme- 
tic, business methods adapted to the ability of the children are used, and every example 
given is an actual problem drawn from business pursuits. Improvement in music wes 
noticeable. The only drawback to the prosperity of the schools was the prevalence of 
scarlet fever, which, for a time, almost caused their suspension.— (City report and return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AND STATE UNIVERSITY NORMAL DEPARTMENT. 
The Iowa State Normal School, Cedar Falls, enrolled 352 students during the year, all 
but 7 of them being normal students, and graduated 37, of whom 28 engaged in teaching. 
‘Two courses are presented, a didactic course of 3 years, which prepares for teaching in 
common and high schools, and a scientific course, comprising one additional year and 
fitting teachers to be superintendents and principals of high and normal schools and acad- 
emies. Tuition is freeto normal students. 
The chair of didactics of the State University, Iowa City, an elective course of the senior 
year, comprises a study of the history of education and of the works of the best educa- 
tional writers, of national systems of education, practical educational topics, school man- 
agement and supervision, and the principlesof education. There were 29 pupils engaged 
in the course during 1881-’82 and 15 were graduated. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The Eastern Iowa Normal School, removed from Grand View to Columbus Junction, 
has been established in a new and convenient building costing $25,000, a gift from the 
people of Columbus Junction. Two normal courses of study are offered, an elementary 
of 3 years and an advanced which adds 2 more. There is also a commercial course of 2 
years. Of 232 students attending, 110 were in the normal courses. 
Southern Iowa Normal School and Commercial Institute, Bloomfield, offers preparatory, 
teachers’, collegiate, commercial, fine art, musical, and telegraphic courses of study. The 
teachers’ department comprises a course including among other branches mathematics, 
natural sciences, language, United States history, civil government, and the theory and 
practice of teaching. The course of 50 weeks is divided into terms of 10 weeks each. 
Beginning, advanced, and review classes are sustained each term, allowing persons of vari- 
ous degrees of advancement to enter during any part of the year; but special attention 
is given to review work during the fifth or summer term. There were 491 normal pupils 
enrolled during 1881~’82 and 20 were graduated. 
Whittier College and Normal Institute, Salem (Friends), offers a teachers’ course of 3 
     
-P-A-G-E-368
TA REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
. 
Years, a scientific course which adds another year, and a course in business, as well as 
elective courses. Of 122 pupils attending during the year 38 were preparing for teach- 
ing. 
Deuter Normal School, Dexter, reports an elementary normal course of 2 years, the full 
course adding one year; also, scientific and business courses and a course preparatory to 
the State University. 
The Normal School of the German Evangelical Synod of Iowa, Waverly, reports a normal 
course of 3 years and 20 students engaged in it during 1881~’82. 
‘The normal department of Upper Iowa University, Fayette, had 150 pupils in a 3-year 
normal course, and the normal department of Oskaloosa College, Oskaloosa, 217 pupils in 
a 4-year course. 
Normal instruction was also given, either in the collegiate or preparatory department, 
at Iowa College, in a course of 1 year; at Amity, Tabor, and Western Colleges, in courses 
of 2 years; at Norwegian Luther College, in one of 3 years; at Cornell College, in one of 2 
preparatory or two collegiate years; at Penn College, in one of 4 years; at Parsons College 
and in Iowa Wesleyan and Central Iowa Universities, in courses not defined. Callanan 
College, Des Moines, and St. Agatha’s Academy (for women), Iowa City, also made pro- 
vision for the training of teachers, the former in a course of 3 years, the latter in one not 
limited as to time. 
A new normal college is reported in the Iowa Normal Monthly to have been estab- 
lished (apparently in 1882) at Shenandoah, under the presidency of I. E. Wilson. 
Normal ox training departments were also reported in connection with the city school 
ere of Davenport and West Des Moines, the former having 13 students enrolled, the 
latter 9. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Tnstitutes for the instruction of teachers, to continue from 2 to 4 weeks, were adver- 
tised by the State superintendent to be held in all the counties of the State, but no fur- 
ther information regarding them has been received. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Iowa Normal Monthly, Dubuque, continued its useful career in 1882, being in 
Volumes V and VI and doing much to interest and aid the teachers of the State. 
‘The Central School Journal, Keokuk, a monthly, was also in its fifth volume and did 
good service in the same direction as the Normal. 
The Normal Index, Columbus Junction, monthly, worked together with the above, 
being then ina third volume; while the Normal Institute, Glidden, and a companion, the 
Glidden News Boy, gave considerable educational information. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of high schools in Iowa cannot be definitely stated, but there were 25 in 
1881-82 approved by the State University as fitting schools for it, their graduates being 
admitted without the examination required of other applicants for admission. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and for summaries 
of them, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The State University of Iowa, Iowa City, has collegiate, law, medical, and dental de- 
partments, noted under Professional Instruction. The collegiate department has 2schools, 
1 of letters and 1 of science, each with 2 courses of study, the former classical and 
philosophical, the latter engineering and general scientific, all requiring 4 years for 
completion. No preparatory work is done, the public high schools supplying most of 
the students. Graduates of approved high schools and academies are admitted without 
examination. The university fund arising from the sale of lands granted by the General 
Government has been supplemented from time to time by legislative grants, and the in- 
stitution now receives an annual State appropriation. Tuition is free to 2 students from 
each county, also to all Iowa soldiers and orphans of soldiers,.on payment of a small inci- 
dental fee. There were 272 students in the collegiate department (71 of them young 
women), against 242 the previous year. 
Of 19 colleges and universities reporting for 1881~-’82 or the preceding year all but 2

continued to be open to young women, the exceptions being Griswold College, Davenport 
(Protestant Episcopal), and St. Joseph’s College, Dubuque (Roman Catholic); all except 
2 (Amity College, College Springs, and the State University) were under the management 
of some religious denomination; all but the State University provided preparatory courses, 
generally of 2 years; all had classical collegiate courses of 4 years; 16 had scientific or 
philosophical courses, which in all but Amity and Griswold Colleges extended over 4 years. 
‘The State University and Iowa Wesleyan added courses in engineering also. Three pro- 
vided 4+year courses especially for young women; 2, philosophical; and 6, commercial 
courses. Nearly all made provision for instruction in music and art, some having music 
courses of 2, 3, and 4 years, with facilities for advanced instruction in vocal and instru- 
mental music. In 14, students intending to teach received instruction during either the 
collegiate or preparatory course; 6 had departments or courses in theology or sacred litera- 
ture; 3, departments in law; 3, in medicine; 1, in dentistry; and 1, in pharmacy. In 
the 15 reporting statistics for the year there were over 1,100 students enrolled in regular 
collegiate classes, and in the 12 which reported the sex of pupils there were over 400 
young women. 
Eleven colleges received gifts amounting to over $134,000 during the year. To Gris- 
wold College $5,500 were given for scholarships and general expenses; to Drake Univer- 
sity, $25,000 for endowment, $20,000 of it being from General I. M. Drake, of Center- 
ville; Parsons College, $5,950 for general endowment; Upper Iowa University, $5,000 to 
endow achair; German College, $600; Iowa Wesleyan University, $900; Cornell College, 
$18,000 for building; Penn College, $3,050 for endowment, &c.; Central University of 
Towa, $56,000 for professorships and general purposes; Tabor College, $6,118 for endow- 
ment, building, and current expenses; and Western College, $8,000 for building. 
For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a summary, see the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
        INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Reports come from 3 institutions either exclusively or, principally for women, viz, the 
Immaculate Conception Academy, Davenport (Roman Catholic); Callanan College, Des 
Moines (non-sectarian); and St. Agatha’s Academy, Iowa City (Roman Catholic), the last 
two authorized to confer collegiate degrees. 
For statistics of colleges for women, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary, 
see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 
SCIENTIFIC, 
Towa Agricultural College, Ames, established in 1858 to give a higher education to 
the industrial classes, afterward received the State’s share of the congressional grant for 
the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts. The courses of study are general and 
technical. The general course aims to give a liberal culture in the sciences which un- 
derlie the industries, without regard to any special pursuit. Certain elective studies 
give it flexibility and adapt it to the wants of both sexes, affording the young women 
more time for domestic economy and kindred subjects and the young men more forthose 
branches which are of especial value to them. ‘The technical courses, while giving a lib- 
eral culture, aim to prepare for some special pursuit or profession. They are: (1) The 
course in agriculture, which requires 4 years of study and leads to the degree of bachelor 
of scientific agriculture; (2) the course in mechanical engineering of 4 years, and lead- 
ing to the degree of bachelor of mechanical engineering; (3) the course in civil engineer- 
ing of 4 years, leading to the degree of bachelor of civil engineering; and (4) the course 
in veterinary science, 2 years in length, leading to the degree of bachelor of veterinary 
medicine. Tuition is free. Of 238 students during the year in regular 4-year courses, 
56 were young women. 
The general scientific course and the civil engineering courses, before noticed as pro- 
vided at the State University, Iowa City, were continued in 1882. The former affords 
a liberal culture on the basis of science, including enough laboratory work to make stu- 
dents familiar with the more important facts and laying a foundation on which they 
may build if they desire to become specialists in any line of work. The engineering 
course aims to lay a good foundation in the principles of engineering and to acquaint 
students with thé best engineering practice. Drawing, surveying, mechanics, and mili- 
tary science and tactics are among the branches included. Cornell College, Mt. Vernon, 
also continued its 4-year course in civil engineering, besides one in general science of 
equal length. Twelve of the other colleges report courses leading to the degree of B. 
s. and extending over 4 years, except in two, Amity and Griswold Colleges, where the 
course was of 3 years. :

  76 REPORT ‘OF ‘THE: ‘COMMISSIONER. OF EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology was taught in 3-year courses at Griswold College, Davenport (Protestant Epis- 
copal), and German College, Mt. Pleasant (Methodist Episcopal). Oskaloosa College, Oska- 
Joosa (Christian), also offered 2 theological courses, an English of 2 years and a classical 
of 4. Drake University, Des Moines (Disciples), organized during the year, had a Bible 
department of 2 years, and Iowa Wesleyan University, Mt. Pleasant (Methodist Episco- 
pal), nue to give some theological instruction during the collegiate course when 
esired. 
For statistics, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary of them, see the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction was given in the Iowa College of Law, a department of Drake Uni- 
versity, opened for instruction in 1881. It was continued if the law departments of Iowa 
State University and Iowa Wesleyan University. In the State and Drake Universities 
(reporting, respectively, 126 and 17 students) the course required 1 year in the formerand 
2 in the latter; in that of Iowa Wesleyan the length of course is not defined, and the cat- 
alogue does not show that there were any students pursuing it. 
For statistics of law schools reporting, see Table XII of the appendix, and for a sum- 
mary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Medical teaching in ‘‘regular”’ schools was continued in 1882 under 8 instructors, with 
273 students, in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Keokuk (organized in 1850), 
and under 11, with 151 students, in the regular medical department of the Iowa State 
University, Iowa City (organized in 1870). It was begun in the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons of Iowa, Des Moines (organized 1882), under 15 professors, with 9 students. 
A good English education was required in the 2 former, as well as 3 years of study in 
all, including attendance on at least 2 lecture courses of 20 weeks each in the two former 
and of 22 weeks in the last named. 
Homeopathy was taught in the homeopathic department of the State University (or- 
ganized in 1877), under 2 professors, 5 lecturers, and an assistant, with 46 students, the 
requirements being essentially the same as in the regular department. The final exam- 
inations in both are supervised by a board of examiners. 
“Eclectic”? medicine was pursued under 13 instructors, with 25 students, at the Iowa 
Eclectic Medical College, Des Moines, organized under this title in 1881 as a department 
of Drake University. It is understood to have since dropped the word ‘‘eclectic”’ from 
its title, but to have retained that system as the basis of its instruction. 
A dental department in the State University, with 10 instructors, was established, as 
announced in 1881, in the autumn of 1882. It had 7 students for its first year. 
Training in veterinary practice was given in one of the courses of the Iowa Agricult- 
ural College, Ames, which covered 2 collegiate years. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The State makes provision for the free instruction of its deaf and dumb 10 to 25 years 
of age in its institution for them at Council Bluffs, and for the blind in the Iowa College 
for the Blind, Vinton. The latter had 141 pupils during the year and 34 instructorsand 
other employés. The branches taught are those of primary, grammar, and high schools; 
the employments, broom and mattress making, cane seating of chairs, and sewing. The 
Institution for the Deaf and Dumb gave instruction to 276 pupils during the year. . The 
employments taught were broom and shoe making, cabinet work, printing, and farming. 
TRAINING OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The feeble-minded are cared for at the Iowa State Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, 
Glenwood, established in 1876. Here those who are so deficient in intelligence as to be 
unfit to attend ordinary schools receive physical and mental training suited to their 
condition. The age for admission is 7 to 18. Children whose parents or guardians are 
too poor to pay are supported by the State. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
A State Reform School, with a department for boys at Eldora and one for girls at 
Mitchellville, undertakes the reformation, education, and industrial training of the youth 
committed to it for juvenile offences. In the boys’ department, besides the common 
schoo] branches, farming, gardening, stock raising, and shoe and hat making are taught. 
Every boy is required toattend school 4 hours each school day during the school months. 
It is visited every month, as the law requires, by the local school trustee. The girls 
must also attend school 4 hours each day and receive 4 hours’ instruction in some 
branch of household labor. — The aim is to prepare.them.to earn a living for themselves 
in domestic service.
-P-A-G-E-371
  
  IOWA. TT 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
To foster in the public schools an interest in useful industries and to give this interest 
a practical direction, Iowa by a law of 1874 encourages industrial expositions in con- 
nection with the public schools. Such expositions are to consist of useful articles made 
by the pupils, as samples of sewing and cooking, knitting, crocheting, and drawing, iron 
and wood work of all kinds, as well as farm and garden products that are the results 
of their own toil. The pupils are to explain the use and method.of such work and the 
processes of culture of their farm and garden products. The papers of the State show 
that these exhibitions are often held, and they must prove very useful. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
«The twenty-seventh annual meeting of the association, held at Cedar Falls, December 
27529, 1882, is described as a great event in the educational annals of the State. A 
hearty fraternal feeling prevailed; the programme was fully carried out, and the papers 
read were excellent. ‘Those for the first day were on ‘‘ Reading and elocution: prov- 
ince, character, and methods;”’ on ‘‘The vocal apparatus: its use and abuse;’’ and on 
“Drawing in the public schools.’? On the second day, after the announcement of com- 
mittees, a paper was read on ‘‘County high schools: their objects and work,” by the 
principal of the Guthrie County high school, and one on ‘‘The defects of our public 
schools and methods of instruction.’’ The president of the association, R. A. Harkness, 
then delivered his annual address, after which Superintendent H. Sabin, of Clinton, read 
a paper on “The children of crime,’’ the subject being continued by Superintendent B. 
F. Miles, of the Iowa Reform School, and by Mr. Lewelling, of the girls’ department 
of that school. Prof. Emlin McClain, of the State University, read a paper on ‘‘The 
legal rights and duties of teachers.’? ‘‘The public desire for industrial education in 
the public schools’? and ‘‘Character the product of culture’? followed. On the third 
day, after the adoption of resolutions approving of congressional aid to education, the 
question ‘‘How can a taste for the reading of literature be formed?’’ was discussed. 
Prof. W. N. Hull, of the State Normal School, then gave a ‘‘Chalk talk,’’ using the 
blackboard to illustrate his system of drawing; following which came a paper on the 
“Evil effects of overmethodizing in school management.”’ In the afternoon, after the 
adoption of resolutions and short speeches by a number of superintendents, theassociation 
adjourned. 
Meetings of the different sections of the association took place as usual during the 
sessions. ‘Those of the Latin teachers’ section, held during the morning of the 28th and 
29th, were regarded by its members as highly interesting and instructive. The only 
papers mentioned in the report were one by Prof. Harkness, of Parsons College, on ‘‘Pri- 
mary instruction in Latin,”’ and one by Principal Cary, of the Des Moines high school, 
on “‘Methods of pronunciation.’? Each was discussed freely though informally, nearly 
all who were present participating. 
In the college professors’ section the first paper was by Prof. Cooke, of Cornell Col- 
lege, on ‘‘Elevation and uniformity of standards.’’ After a discussion of it by Presi- 
dent Beardshear, of Western College, Toledo, Prof. Wilson, of Coe College, Cedar Rap- 
ids, read _a paper entitled ‘‘Things left undone.’’? A discussion followed, generally in 
the line of commendation of the paper. 
The county superintendents’ section met December 27, and after introductory remarks 
by the vice president, Superintendent Frost discussed the question ‘‘To what extent 
should county superintendents require reports from teachers in country schools??? On 
the following day the main subject of debate was ‘“‘What recognition should be given 
teachers who complete a graded course of study for normal institutes?’ and on the 29th 
“What immunities from examination can we consistently give teachers holding cer- 
tificates from other counties or applicants holding diplomas from colleges?’’ All three 
papers were quite freely discussed. When the last mentioned was disposed of, State 
Superintendent Akers offered suggestions of value to superintendents in their work. 
In the city superintendents’ and principals’ section a paper was read by Principal O. 
C. Scott, on ‘‘ The practical side of high school work.” 
SOUTHWESTERN IOWA EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The fourth annual meeting of this association was held at Corning, July 5-7, 1882. 
After the adoption of a new constitution, among other papers read was one on ‘‘ How 
can we inspire in our pupils alove for good literature?’’ Other papers read were on ‘‘ The 
proper place of natural science in the public high school,’”’ on ‘“‘The proper work of 
the public school,’ and on the question ‘‘ How can teachers secure better wages?”’? In 
the evening State Superintendent Akers delivered a lecture on ‘‘The elevation of the

masses.”? The first topic of the following day was ‘‘ The graded course of institute in- 
struction: what are the results of the first year’s work?’’ A lady spoke of the recog- 
nition that should be given teachers who complete this course, after which came a 
paper containing replies from county superintendents in response to inquiries made of them. 
After further discussion of the subject, a paper on ‘‘ How to teach languages’? was read. 
and debated in a spirited manner, resolutions were adopted, and the association ad- 
journed. 
q COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ CONVENTIONS. 
At several conventions of superintendents held in different districts of the State dur- 
ing the summer of 1882, State Superintendent Akers presented such topics as “The du- 
ties of superintendents,’’ ‘‘Changes in the school laws of Iowa,”’ ‘‘Compliance with the 
law requiring school boards to plant shade trees and beautify school grounds,” and on 
‘Meetings of teachers.’’ Other topics of discussion by different members at these meet- 
ings were ‘‘To what extent should a spirit of emulation be encouraged in the schools?” 
“The duties of the county superintendent in the school room,’’ ‘‘The adoption of a 
course of study for ungraded schools,’’ and ‘‘ How to secure the best practical resultsin 
teaching.”’

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS, 
For the State and foreach county there is a superintendent of public instruction, elected 
biennially by the people; for school districts? 2 board of 3 members, elected each for 3 
years, one liable to change each year. For Samia applicants for State diplomas and 
State certificates, there isa State board of education; for examination of teachers in coun- 
ties, there are associated with the superintendent 2 holders of first grade certificates, each to serve 1 year. For the care of State school funds there is.a board of commissioners con- sisting of the State superintendent, secretary of state, and attorney general. Women 
may_vote and hold school offices.

80 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
‘The schools of the State are of all grades, high and normal schools being included, with 
a State agricultural college and a State university. There are also schools for the deaf 
and dumb and the blind and a reform school, all sustained by the State. No sectarian 
doctrine may be taught in the public schools, but the reading of the Bible without 
comment is not prohibited. For the improvement of teachers, county teachers’ insti- 
tutes must be held annually ; they are supported by an appropriation not to exceed $100 
made by the board of county commissioners and by funds received from persons attending 
and from those examined for certificates. These certificates are of first, second, and third 
grades, and continue in force 2years, 1 year, and6 months. Teachersmustreport to county 
superintendents and county superintendents to the State superintendent. The State 
treasurer must also report semiannually to the State superintendent the amount of 
money in the treasury for the support of schools and subject to disbursement. There 
must be uniformity of text books. All public schools are free, and children from 8 to 14 
must attend at least 12 weeks each year unless excused by the school authorities or taught 
elsewhere. 
GENERAL EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. 
The report of State Superintendent Speer shows very gratifying progress in the school 
work of the State for 1881~’82. ‘The number of school districts organized was 111 more 
than in the preceding year; the number reporting, 86 more; the number with the mini- 
mum term of school or more, 289 greater; and, although the number of school-houses 
reported was less by 116, the accommodations were much greater, there being 241 additional 
school-rooms. . The receipts for the free schools were $228,458 greater and the expendi- 
ture for the support of them $197,839 more. The enrolment advanced 22,126, being 
12,506 more than the increase in youth of school age. The average daily attendance in 
public schools slightly exceeded even the increased enrolment. There were 208 fewer 
men employed as teachers and only 117 more women, the former at a considerable re- 
duction and the latter at a slightly advanced pay. This record on the whole indicates a 
general zeal for public education that is creditable alike to the State and its children. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS, 
Cities of more than 15,000 inhabitants have elective boards of education of 3 members 
from each ward, one of the 3 liable to change each year; cities with from 2,000 to 
15,000 have similar boards of 2 members from each ward, one of the 2 liable to annual 
change. The larger boards may and the smaller must choose a superintendent.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Atchison for 1881-’82 reports 5 different school buildings, with 14 rooms for primary 
classes, 14 for grammar, and 1 for high, all affording 1,650 sittings, a scanty supply for 
the 2,258 in average daily attendance. The schools, accordingly, were overflowing, 
many having to be turned away for want of room. _The high school is reported to have 
had 90 pupils, with an average attendance of 88; private schools had an estimated enrol- 
ment of over 1,000. 
Lawrence had 10 school buildings in 1881-’82, with 25 rooms for study and recitation 
and 2 for recitation only. These buildings, with grounds, furniture, &c., were valued at 
$104,200. ‘There was an increase in the enrolment in the public schools of 56 over the 
Jast year and a gain of 158 in average daily attendance, with 1 more teacher. The high 
school enrolled 123 pupils. 
Leavenworth public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, occupied 55 rooms. 
‘There were 7 school buildings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $178,000. ‘There was a de- 
crease in youth of school age, but! a‘ gain. of 159 in the number enrolled and of 75 in 
average daily attendance, with 1° more teacher. ‘The high school reports an enrol- 
ment of 200 pupils with 4 teachers,.the regular course covering 4 years. ~ Total receipts 
for the year, $29,895. :
-P-A-G-E-375
KANSAS. 81 
Topeka had 4 primary school buildings, 8 with both primary and grammar classes, 
and one high school building; an increase of 291 was reported in youth of school age, 
and of 804 in enrolment in public schools, with a gain of 15 teachers. There were 97 
pupils in the high school, under 1 instructor. The 13 school buildings, with sites, &c., 
were valued at $179,800. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEPARTMENTS. 
The Kansas State Normal School, located at Emporia, according to its: biennial report, 
had just closed two of the most successful yearsin its history. The enrolment in 1881— 
182 was 402, being an increase of 36 over the preceding year. The students in 1881 and 
1882 represented 44 counties in Kansas, and 8 different States. The graduating class of 
1881 numbered 21; that of 1882, 44, 40 of whom have since engaged in teaching. The 
library and apparatus were said to be insufficient for the needs of the work. 
A well organized training school was connected with the institution, presenting in- 
struction in Kindergiirten, primary, intermediate, and grammar school grades. This 
school receives children at 3 years of age and provides a full course of study, which 
prepares for admission to the normal department. 
The University of Kansas provides a 3-year normal course, in which there were 53 stu- 
dents, 33 of whom were young women, a total gain of 15over 1881. Four of these were 
graduated and received from the State board of education State certificates good for 5 
years. One of the students in 1882 was a resident graduate. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Kansas Normal College, Fort Scott, organized in 1878, reports 105 students in its 
teachers’ class for 1881-82, of whom 55 were male, besides 162 other students, all under 
7 instructors. 
The Kansas Normal School and Business Institute, Paola, prepares for teaching and for 
business with a 3-year course. It reported to the State superintendent 228 normal 
students in 1882, besides 212 others. Children selected from the city schools form its 
training department. 
The Campbell Normal University and Commercial Institute, Holton, a private enterprise, 
organized in 1882, with a faculty of 7 instructors, and with nearly 100 students enrolled in 
November, 1882, presents a 3-year collegiate course of 48 weeks each. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
County normal institutes were advertised to be held in 54 counties during 1882. The 
union of two or three counties is permitted for this purpose where the population of each 
is less than 3,000. 
A writer in The Educationist reports having visited 24 of these institutes during July 
and August, and says the work was of a high order, there being less talking and more 
teaching than the year before. Everywhere were displayed a spirit of thoughtful ear- 
nestness and a realization of theimportance and responsibility of the work, but there was 
the same dearth of reference books noticed last year. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Educationist, published at Emporia by the former State superintendent of public 
instruction in Indiana, George W. Hoss, continued to be the official organ of public in- 
struction and the chief medium for the diffusion of educational information ¢hroughout 
the State. The Industrialist, published weekly at Manhattan, is the organ of the Kan- 
sas Agricultural and Mechanical College, and is devoted specially to industrial educa- 
tion. The former was in its fourth volume in 1882; the latter in its eighth. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of cities reporting high schools for1882 was 30, with 1,700 pupils and 149 
graduates. The length of the school courses varied, the shortest, at Chetopa, being of 
12 months; the longest, at Winfield, of 45 months. The high schools recognized by the 
State University as qualified to prepare students for its courses were those of Abilene, 
Atchison, Beloit, Emporia, Junction City, Lawrence, Leavenworth, Neodesha, Peabody, 
Topeka, and Washington, 11 out of the 30 above mentioned. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

appendix following; for summaries of them, see corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. For preparatory departments of colleges and scientific schools,

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, in its collegiate department presénts classical, 
scientific, modern literature, civil engineering, natural history, chemical, and musical 
courses, each of 4 years, with a department of elementary instruction and 3 higher 
normal classes of 3 years each. The institution also provides a 2-year course in lawand. 
a preparatory course of a year in medicine. The total number of students in attend- 
ance (more than half of them in the preparatory department) was 443, 39 of them from 
other States. A graduate course for non-residents of 3 years beyond the regular col- 
legiate is provided, examinations being required at the end of each year. All courses 
are open alike to both sexes. The Kansas Review, a monthly, is conducted by an asso- 
ciation of the students. 
Other collegiate institutions, 8 in number, were St. Benedict’s College, Atchison, and 
St. Mary’s College, St. Mary’s (Roman Catholic); Baker University, Baldwin (Metho- 
dist Episcopal); Highland University, Highland (Presbyterian); Gould College, Harlan 
(founded in 1881); Lane University, Lecompton (United Brethren); Ottawa Galveniity, 
Ottawa (Baptist); and Washburn College, Washburn (Congregational). All report 
preparatory departments; all but Gould, classical courses of 4 years; all but St. Bene- 
dict’s and St. Mary’s, scientific courses also; while Baker, Highland, Gould, and Lane 
had normal courses. Baker, Highland, St. Benedict’s, and St. Mary’s taught music, 
more or less, and St. Benedict’s had instituted an ecclesiastical course. All but the 2 
Roman Catholic schools admit both sexes. For statistics, see Table IX of the appendix; 
for a summary of these statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
INSTITUTION FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The College of the Sisters of Bethany, Topeka (Protestant Episcopal), chartered in 
1870, continued to be for 1882 the only school of this class reporting. It had 17 instract- 
ors and an enrolment of 259 pupils, of whom 64 were in collegiate classes, 94 in prepar- 
atory and scientific, and 101 in Kindergarten and primary studies. Whole number of 
graduates, 39, 1 only at the close of 188i-’82. Estimated value of collegiate property, 
including furniture, site of 20 acres, and buildings, $150,000; collegiate course, 3 years. 
For further statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, provided general scientific, civil engineering, 
natural history, aid chemical courses, each of 4 years. 
The Kansas Agricultural College, Manhattan, has a general course in agriculture and 
science of 4 years. Three-fourths of the students come from the homes of farmets. 
In January and February of 1882 a series of 6 farmers’ institutes, conducted by members 
of the faculty, was held in as many counties, imparting some of the benefits of the col- 
- legiate instruction to those outside of the institution and bringing the college into closer 
relation with the farmers of the State. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.2- St. Benedict’s College, Atchison (Roman Catholic), in 1882 instituted an ec- 
clesiastical course covering one preparatory and three theological years of study. Kansas 
Theological School, Topeka (Protestant Episcopal), continued its 3-year theological course, 
which by the canons of the Protestant Episcopal Churchis ordinarily to be prepared forby a ~ 
collegiate course or its equivalent. It reported 2 instructors and 4 students in 1882. 
Law.— The law department of Kansas University (with 2 instructors and 7 senior stu- 
dents in 1881~’82) gave a course of law covering 2 annual terms of 7 months each. 
Medicine.—The medical preparatory course of the University of Kansas, covering 2 
terms of 20 weeks each, appears again in the university catalogue of 1881-82, but no 
professors or students are indicated, nor do any appear in the opening term of the next 
session. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES. 
The Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Olathe, under the 
control of the State board of charities, reported for the year ending June 30, 1882, the 
same number of pupils as given in last year’s report, 171 (males 89, females 82), under 
‘Vinstructors. They were taught the common school branches, the method of instruc- 
tion being the manual and articulation combined. The course comprises also such em- 
ployments as printing, cabinet making, shoemaking, sewing, and housework. Since

the foundation of the institution in 1862, 306 pupils have received instruction. The 
average time spent in the institution by each pupil is 3} years. Tuition, board, books, 
and other necessaries are furnished free. The grounds, buildings, and apparatus were 
valued at $54,000. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The State Institution for the Edueation of the Blind, at Wyandotte, reports for the 
year ending June, 1881, an average attendance of 52 pupils, of whom 2 were graduated; 
for the year ending June, 1882, there was an average of 53, of whom 3 were graduated. 
Instruction was given in the literary branches of a good education, as well as in music, 
and broom making was taught to the boys. Through appropriations of $25,000 for 
additional buildings and $3,000 for steam heating, the accommodations were much im- 
roved. 
y REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
No report for 1882 has reached this Bureau from the State Reform School for Boys, 
near Topeka, opened in 1881, which had 12 boys under its charge in July of that year. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Kansas State Teachers’ Association held its annual session at Topeka, December

A State board of education looks after the general interests of the free schools; a State 
board of examiners tests the qualifications of candidates for State school certificates; 
while a State superintendent of public instruction acts as president and executive officer 
of each board. Each county, through its presiding judge and justices of the peace at the
-P-A-G-E-379
    KENTUCKY. 85 
court of claims, chooses biennially a commissioner for general oversight of common 
schools, and he forms a board for the examination of teachers by associating with him- 
self 2 other persons. Each school district for whites in a county has 3 trustees, all 
chosen together at the first election by the resident voters (widews with children to be 
taught being allowed to vote) and afterwards one each year. In districts for colored 
pupils, the white county commissioner appoints yearly 3 trustees from the colored race. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Most of these remained in 1882 the same as previously reported, but an act of April 
24 in that year did away with several distinctions made in 1874 between the systems 
for white and colored youth. The length of term, the course of study, the qualifica- 
tions of teachers, and the rates of payment to these teachers in the schools for blacks 
were made to correspond as much as might be with those in schools for whites; the age 
for free instruction in the former (6-16) was changed to that forthe latter (6-20). Both 
races, too, were made participants (on the same basis, the number of youth of school 
age) in the 6 per cent. interest from the State school fund ($1,327,000), as well as in the 
receipts from the State school tax, which tax, by the same act, was raised from 20 to 22 
cents on $100 of property. 
Some differences as respects the two races, however, are still maintained. One (for 
the benefit of colored schools) is that they continue to receive, with their share of the 
general school tax, the proceeds of fines, forfeitures, penalties, and taxes collected specifi- 
cally from the colored race, except the capitation tax on negro voters, which is abol- 
ished. Two others, of a different character, are (1) that the colored people do not elect 
their own district school officers, like the whites, but such officers. are chosen for them 
by the white county school commissioners, and (2) that, instead of putting their school- 
houses where most convenient, they must, if in the country, locate them at least a mile 
away from any school for whites, and if in cities, at least 600 feetaway. Of course, there 
is also the prohibition, usual in the Southern States, of the union of the two races in any 
public school. Provision is made too for separate institutes and teachers’ associations. 
The new law is on the whole a great step forward in the improvement of the colored race.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Covington in 1881-’82 more than recovered its losses of school population and attend- 
ance in 1880~’81, there being a gain in school population of 888 against a loss of 463, and 
in other points a proportionate gain. Six school buildings, having 4,000 sittings for study, 
with other school property, were valued at $204,500. ‘The school course isa graded one 
covering 12 years. German is taught in 4 grades, and drawing in all below the high. 
Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 2,560, only 818 less than in public 
schools. There isa board of examiners. The superintendent says that the work of the 
year had been satisfactory. 
Lexington reported 5 white schools and 4 colored. The former enrolled 1,249, with an 
average attendance of 935; the latter, 956, with an average attendance of 484, In the 
total enrolment there was a gain of 23 over the previous year. No other information 
is at hand. 
Louisville shows a gain of 4,055 in school population, exceeding that of the previous 
year by 1,805; also, a gain of 997 in enrolment against a loss of 801 the year before, and 
of 490 in average daily attendance, against a loss of 228. There were 30 school build- 
ings, valued, with other property, at $875,144, in which were taught for whites 7 primary 
and branch, 18 secondary, and 5 intermediate schools, having 8 grades of 1 year each, 
and a high school for each sex, with courses of 4 years each. For colored there were 2

primary, 1 intermediate, and 2 secondary schools. Music was continued,in all the 
grades below the high, and drawing throughout all. German, under special teachers, 
went through 7 grades below the high schools. The schools are opened daily with brief 
readings from the Bible without comment, and may be closed with singing. ‘There were 
two ae of examiners, one for English teachers, the other for German.— (Manual and. 
return. a 
Newport, with a loss of 7 in school population, gained in enrolment and average daily 
attendance, the latter being 79 per cent. of the enrolment. There were 5 school build- 
ings, with 2,510 sittings, the entire school property being valued at $133,500. In these 
buildings there were taught 44 schools, 1 high, 5 intermediate, 37 primary, and 1 
colored, under 46 teachers, including a special teacher in drawing and penmanship. 
Schools were in session 202 days, with 1,002 fewer cases of tardiness, 10 per cent. fewer 
of corporal punishment, and none of permanent suspension. There is a board of exam- 
iners; also, provision for normal training. The president of the board of education, 
while reporting the schools in good condition, deplored the lack of school room, and the 
legislature, at its last session, authorized a vote of the city as to levying a tax of 5 
cents on $100 for additional school buildings. Estimated enrolment in private and 
parochial schools, 700. 
Paducah showed a gain of 116 in school population, of 128 in enrolment, and of 69 in 
average daily attendance, the number of teachers remaining the same. It added 1 school 
building, and school property was valued at $33,700. The schools, which were of 12 
3, were in session 205 days; the per cent. of average daily attendance on enrolment 
was 78 and on school population 36. Primary pupils make up nearly half the schools 
and fully a quarter of the school population. In the primary schools the boys and girls 
are about equal, but only 1 in 15 or 16 of the boys reaches the grammar school and only 
1 in 100 the high, most of them leaving school at the end of their tenth year. The super- 
intendent thinks the female sex is fast becoming the more cultured of thetwo. A weekly 
teachers’ meeting washeld. Estimated enrolment in private and parochial schools, 200. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND NORMAL DEBARTMENTS. 
Of the 12 normal schools and normal departments reported in 1880-’81 only 4 report 
any statistics for 1881-’82 (for which see Table III of the appendix). 
The Kentucky State Normal School, the superintendent says, was chartered for only 
two years and existed only to start such schools in the State. The Kentucky Female 
Orphan School trains its orphan girls with a view to fitting them for teachers’ work. It 
reported for the year 5 teachers and 83 inmates; pupils are admitted at 14 years and up- 
wards. The school has an endowment fund of $120,000, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
It is presumed that the teachers’ institutes required to be held annually in each county 
for whites, and allowed to be held for colored, were held in 1881—’82, but no report of 
their sessions has come to hand. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Covington reported a high school, with a 4-year classical and a 3-year scientific course; 
191 enrolled pupils; 155 in average daily attendance, and 13 graduated, all girls but 1. 
Louisville had a high school for each sex for whites and one for both sexes for colored, 
the schools for whites with courses of 4 years and the school for colored with a 3-year 
course; there was a total of 645 enrolled and of 539 in average daily attendance. 
Newport high school shows a 3-year course, with 73 enrolled, 58 in average attendance, 
and 8 girl graduates. 
Paducah had a high school, with a 3-year course and 65 students, 60 of them girls. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of schools of this class and of business colleges, see Tables IV and VI of 
the appendix; for summaries, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Of 17 universities and colleges, 15 make return for 1881~’82. Eight had preparatory 
courses of 2 or 3 years; 11, classical courses of 4 years; 1, a classical course of 3 years; 5, 
classical courses of undefined length. In the Kentucky Military College the B. a. course 
usually oceupies 3 or 4 years, with agraduate course provided beyond this. Four offered

normal instruction; 10 had undefined commercial courses; 5 had literary courses, al] but 
1 of 4 years, and that of 3; 6 gave moreor less training for ministerial work; 1 had alaw 
course; 5 included music and 4 music and art in their courses; while in 10 French and 
German were among the regular or elective studies. South Kentucky College, Hopkins- 
ville, was reopened in 1881 with a larger faculty, an extended course of study, an exten- 
sion of its privileges to both sexes alike, and the addition of normal and commercial 
courses, 
Kentucky Wesleyan College, Millersburg, was found by an examining committee of the 
Methodist conference to have an excellent curriculum and to require a high standard 
of proficiency. Central University, Richmond, during the year added to the department 
of mathematics and astronomy an optional course in theoretical and practical railroad 
engineering. 
Ogden College, Bowling Green, reporting for the first time in 1881—’82, presents no fixed 
course, but arranges its studies in 8 schools, of ancient languages, of mathematics, of 
natural science, of philosophy, of civil engineering, of modern languages, of English 
language and literature, and of commercial science. It was founded by the late Robert 
W. Ogden, after whom it was named. In his will, among other donations, Mr. Ogden 
provided for 60 free scholarships. Though non-sectarian, it inculcates Christian moral- 
ity and its course provides for weekly study of the Bible. Its property was valued at 
$20,000 and it has $120,000 in productive funds, yielding an income of $8,000. 
For statistics of colleges of this class reporting, see Table IX of the appendix; fora 
summary of their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner pre- 
ceding. —(Catalogues and returns. ) 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Twenty colleges and seminaries for young women reported in 1881~’82 against 18 the 
previous year. All had preparatory courses; 18, collegiate courses of 4 years, most of 
them including drawing, art, music, German, and French. Bowling Green Female Col- 
lege arranges its studies in schools, not in years. Caldwell Female College, Danville, 
reopened in 1881, had 41 students in its collegiate course, not yet defined. All the 20 
schools offered training in vocal and instrumental music; 15, in German and’ French, 
1 adding Italian; 3, in German only; while 1 showed no modern language; 4 provided 
normal training for those who wish to become teachers. 
In nearly all especial importance had been recently given to English language and lit- 
erature. In 5 the study of the Bible and of the elements of theology was in the regular 
course; 2 offered graduate courses; 6 had gymnastic training. Most of them appear to 
have about the same classical training as the colleges for young men. The aggregate 
collegiate attendance of women for the year was nearly 3,000, about 1,200 more than the 
number of men in colleges. 
Christ’s Church Seminary, Lexington, Louisville Female Seminary, and Paducah Fe- 
maleCollege were not heard from. 
For statistics of these schools, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary, the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTLFIC. 
The State Agricultural and Mechanical College, Lexington, reorganized in 1880, con- 
tinued in 1881-’82 to give instruction in its 14 courses of from 1 to 5 years in length. 
The scientific course included, with the usual scientific studies, agriculture, horticulture, 
landscape gardening, civil history, and political economy, Latin, Frerich, or German, and 
English language and literature. In the scientific department there were 11 profess- 
ors and 321 students, a gain of 87 over the previous year. It has 400 State scholar- 
ships, not one-half of which were filled. Provision is also made for some free instruction 
in the normal department. ‘The income for the year was $9,900 from a fund of $165,000, 
$17,000 from the State, art $2,000 from tuition fee: At the commencement 3 young 
men received degrees in arts and 3 in science.— (Register and return. ) 
Eleven other colleges reported courses in general science, those in 6 covering 4, in 3 
only 3 years, in 2 not defined. Kentucky Military Institute reported a course in civil 
engineering. 
‘or statistics of scientific schools and scientific departments reporting, see Tables IX 
and X of appendix; for summaries of these, corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
    PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—There were in 1881-’82 4 theological seminaries, 3 with 3-year courses, 
viz: Danville Theological Seminary (Presbyterian), requiring for admission a college 
diploma or an examination; Preston Park Seminary, Louisville (Roman Catholic); and 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  88 : REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville. The College of the Bible, Lexington 
(Christian), in 1882 had a 4-year course open to young men without a classical education. 
Biblical instruction in connection with college studies was given in St. Joseph’s, Berea, 
Eminence, South Kentucky, and Bethel Colleges and in Central University. 
For statistics of theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appendix; for asum- 
mary of such statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preced- 
ing. 
Legal.—The law school of Kentucky University was not in operation in 1881-82. 
With the exception of some preparatory legal studies in South Kentucky College, the 
Louisville School of Law alone seems to have: afforded legal training. It requires for 
admission evidence of sufficient mental development to pursue advantageously the studies 
of the course. Though intended to occupy 2 years, the whole course may be completed 
in 1, Graduates are entitled to practise without further examination. 
Medical.—Since 1874 there has been provision in this State for a board of examiners in 
each judicial district to test the qualifications of medical practitioners who have not di- 
plomas of some chartered school of medicine; but it is said to have been little observed. 
Four medical schools, all in Louisville, reported for the year 1881-82. ‘These were Hos- 
pital College of Medicine, Kentucky School of Medicine, Louisville Medical College, and 
the medical department of the University of Louisville. All provided courses of medical 
study covering 3 years, including 2 terms of lectures of 21 weekseach. The examinations 
for the degree in all were the same on all the branches taught in the colleges. The 
Hospital College gave notice that after 1882-’83 a graded course of 3 years would be re- 
quired. Candidates for graduation in this school who on final examination receive 90 
credits in 100 are marked ‘‘ distinguished’? in the published list of alumni. 
The Louisville College of Pharmacy continued in 1881~’82 to require for graduation an 
apprenticeship of 4 years and attendance on 2 courses of lectures; important additions 
made to its building, cabinet, library, and apparatus increased its facilities for instruc- 
tion. 
For statistics of the above schools, see Table XIII of the appendix; for a summary, a 
corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Danville, reported for 
1881-82 9 instructors, 2 of them semi-mutes, and 145 inmates, making 810 since its 
foundation. The average term of instruction is 7 years. Of the graduates 7 had be- 
come teachers. The pupils are taught the common school branches, including the ele- 
ments of natural philosophy. For boys the employments are carpentry, printing, book- 
binding, broom making, and gardening; for girls, sewing and housekeeping. Articula- 
tion was taught only incidentally. The State appropriation for the year was $27,000. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Kentucky Institute for the Education of the Blind, Louisville, had 25 instructors 
and employés (8 of the last mentioned being blind), with 77 pupils for the year, and had 
had 441 since opening. In school elementary studies were pursued, with special train- 
ing in music. The employments taught were broom making, cane seating, mattress 
amaking, fancy work, and sewing. A Kindergarten department had proved satisfactory. 
The president speaks of the year as one of the best in the history of the institution. 
There was a library of 1,200 volumes; property valued at $100,000; a State appropriation 
of $18,870; a total income of $28,859; and an expenditure of $20,084. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Kentucky Institution for the Education and Training of Feeble-Minded Children, 
Frankfort, reported 27 instructors and employés, with 132 inmates October 1, 1881, and 
143 October 1, 1882. All the inmates were taught the common English branches; boys, 
to work in the shops and gardens; girls, to do laundry work, sewing, and housekeep- 
ing. During the year extensive improvements were made in the buildings, requiring 
the moving of a great amount of earth, which, with the help of 1 laborer, was done by 
the boys, the carpenter boys doing the wainscoting of the new rooms. The superin- 
tendent says that the workshop, laundry, and sewing rooms showed conclusively that 
feeble-minded children can be taught industrial occupations so as to make them self sup- 
porting. The State expended on this class of unfortunates $31,748 during the year. 
INSTRUCTION OF ORPHANS. 
There were 8 institutions for orphans and dependent children and 1 for the normal 
training of female orphans over 14 years of age. In all instruction was given, as
-P-A-G-E-383

far as possible, in the common branches and in such industries as would facilitate self 
support. A constant endeavor was made to provide good homes or employment for their 
inmates. 
For statistics of these institutions, see Table XXII of appendix; for summaries of them, 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Louisville House of Refuge does its work in three departments, 1 for white boys, 
1 for colored boys, and 1 for white girls, each in a separate building, with its own play- 
ground, workshop, garden, and teacher, under 1 superintendent. Since opening there 
had been 1,508 inmates, and for the year 323. Of those taught during the year 28 had 
intemperate parents. Instruction was given in the common school branches, in shoe- 
making, cane seating, gardening, and farm work for boys; for girls, sewing, laundry 
work, and housekeeping. The earnings from shops, garden, and farm were $6,604; 
the additional current expenses, $19,868.— (Seventeenth annual report.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
KENTUCKY STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its eighth annual meeting at Hopkinsville, December 26-28, 
1882. No other information of the session has been received except that it was regarded 
as the best meeting of the association since its organization. The number of teachers in 
attendance was not large, but a deep and active interest is said to have been manifest 
throughout.— (Journal of Education.) : 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROF, NOBLE BUTLER. 
Noble Butler was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, July, 1810, and died at 
Louisville, Ky., February 12,1882. His ancestors came to America with William Penn. 
When the boy was 7 years old his father settled near Madison, Ind. From the log school- 
house there he went to Hamover College, Ind. In 1839 he became professor of Greek 
and Latin in the University of Louisville, giving his life to education and general cult- 
ure. He was the author of a Practical and Critical Grammar, revised and edited Good- 
rich’s series of readers, and afterward published a series of hisown. He wrote a Theory 
of the Hebrew Tenses which was adopted asa standard. His last work was a Revised 
and Practical Grammar, issued a year before his death. He also entered largely into 
the field of general literature both asacritic andapoet. He was peculiarly an educator, 
having a rare faculty of imparting knowledge, and thus did much to cultivate a high 
taste for literature and love of culture in the city where he lived.

being available.) 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
There is a State superintendent of public instruction elected for 4 years; a State board 
of education, with the State superintendent as executive officer; and there are parish 
boards of not less than 5 nor more than 9 members, except in the parish of Orleans, which 
answer to county boards elsewhere. ‘These last may appointa parish superintendent, 
who becomes secretary of the parish board. Women over 21 are eligible to educational 
offices. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
‘The means for the education of children between the ages of 6 and 18 in this State come 
(1) from the proceeds of a State fund of $1,130,868, bearing 4 per cent. interest (which, 
however, is to be paid out of taxes “‘ levied and collected for the general purposes of edu- 
cation”) to be paid annually to the townships; (2) from a poll tax of $1 to $1.50 on each 
voter; (5) from a State tax not to exceed 1 mill on $1; and (4) from a local levy of 2 
mills on $1, which any parish may order. ‘Teachers must receive a certificate of com- 
petency from the parish board, and those who maintain discipline without punishment, 
other qualifications being sufficient, are preferred. Each school must have at least 10 
pupils and not more than 60 to each teacher. 
No denominational or sectarian school is to be supported by public school funds. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Although no official report for 1882 comes from the State superintendent, it is evident 
from the Louisiana School Journal for that year, edited by a former superintendent, that 
the public school interests went from bad to worse. The poor pay of teachers, the in- 
sufficient provision for comfort in rural school-houses, and the inadequacy of funds for 
the support of even the New Orleans schools, together with the continued want of a 
definite school law corresponding with the new constitution, combined to make good
-P-A-G-E-385
LOUISIANA. 91 
and efficient school work almost impossible. Teachers in the country schools, the super- 
intendent said in his last report, had rooms almost destitute of educational conveniences, 
and those of New Orleans, in December, 1882, were still waiting for the pay which they 
had earned in 1881. ‘To make things worse, the aunual fund for the support of public 
schools—already charged by the constitution of 1879 with the payment of $45,235 inter- 
est on the school fund and with $14,551 interest on other funds—was further charged 
by the legislature of 1882 with the payment of $10,000 to each of the three State uni- 
versities, one at Baton Rouge and 2 at New Orleans. As the annual school revenue was 
fixed at $107,000, these large deductions, with others for the pay of school officers, left 
Jess than $9,000 for the support of free schools throughout the State, exclusive of New 
Orleans, which depends largely on special appropriations. The result has naturally been 
that outside of New Orleans free education of the masses has been substantially sus- 
pended. Almost the only reliance for the maintenance of schools in the rural parishes 
is on volunteer taxation in addition to the poll tax, which latter under the constitution 
is to be retained in the parishes in which it is collected. This, an intelligent writer in 
the New Orleans Daily Picayune of April 24, 1882, says, if faithfully collected, should 
secure for the free schools at least $120,000 annually. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The Kindergarten Institute of Mrs. J. E. Seaman, noticed last year in the report from 
this Bureau, was continued in 1882 with encouraging results. For statistics, see Table 
V of the appendix. 
The Louisiana Journal of Education for November, 1882, says that in most of the 
private schools of New Orleans the experiment of connecting this form of education for 
young children with other preparation for higher classes has been tried with such good 
results as to justify the belief that it has become a permanent feature in primary school 
work. The children are said to be not only happier, but also more apt to learn, making 
better scholars in the more advanced grades. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The two normal institutions for free education of white and colored teachers at New 
Ovleans continued in 1881~’82 to be supported by the Peabody education fund, but doubt 
‘was expressed of the continuance of such support if the State failed to provide partially 
for their maintenance. The distribution to each of the schools is given in the report of 
the trustees as $1,500, with $1,000 for public schools, $200 for teachers’ institutes, and 
$200 for the Louisiana Journal of Education. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
NEW ORLEANS. 
Officers.—The public schools of this city are under a board of 20 directors, 8 appointed 
by the State board of education and 12 by the board of administrators of the city, with 
a superintendent appointed by the directors. 
Statistics. —Population in 1880, 216,090; youth of school age in 1881, 61,456; enrolled 
in public schools in 1882, 24,976; average daily attendanee, 15,224; number of teachers, 
402; school buildings, 52; receipts forschools, $208,339; expenditures for them, $279,316; _ 
valuation of school property, $667,500; enrolment in private and parochial schools, 5,000. 
Additional particulars.—Of the 52 schools under the care of the city board in 1881, 13 
were for the exclusive use of colored pupils, with an enrolment of 5,473. The 12 build- 
ihgs erected from the proceeds of the McDonogh school fund were commodious and com- 
fortable, while the others, 13 of them rented, were poorly adapted to educational purposes, 
the réoms being too small, the light and ventilation defective, and the grounds insufii- 
cient. 
In July, 1882, we learn from the Louisiana Journal of Education, contracts were signed 
for the erection of 2 new school-houses out of the McDonogh fund, now limited to the 
construction and repair of buildings. One of these was to take the place of a fine school- 
house in Algiers, destroyed by fire, the other to be a large and substantial structure of 
brick, in the third ward, with a capacity for about 700 pupils. These were to be fin- 
ished in time for use in the fall session df the schools. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
The Peabody Normal Sentinary, New Orleans, gave free normal training to white grad- 
uates of high schools and colleges and other advanced students over 16 years of age 
from any partof the State. The normal department offered a 3-year course; in this course 
previons studies were reviewed and the members of the senior class were daily required 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
    92 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
to teach classes of children in the model school for an hour or more. There was also a 
preparatory department for young ladies. The normal pupils for 1881-82 numbered 48 
young women; in the preparatory and model class there were 40; instructors, 4; 14 were 
graduated in 1882. This seminary is said by its principal to have prepared during the 
twelve years of its existence not less than 200 well qualified teachers for the public school 
system of the State. . 
The Peabody Normal School for Colored Students, New Orleans, presented two years of 
free normal training to graduates and advanced scholars of the higher grades over 17 
years of age and fitted them for teaching; the school for 1881~’82 numbered 34 students, 
under 2 instructors. During the 5 years in which it has been in operation this school 
has furnished the public system 40 teachers. 
Straight University, New Orleans (for colored), gave a 2-year course of normal training to 
82 young men and 29 young women, under 3 instructors; number of graduates, 22 for 
the year, 12 of whom were teaching at the date of the report. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ institutes were held at New Orleans twice a month during February, March, 
and April. The largest number of teachers present was 150. The subjects discussed were 
arithmetic, elocution, drawing, history, the Kindergarten, methods of discipline, object 
teaching, patience in the school room, spelling, and the study of maps. Other sessions 
were held during the fall term. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Louisiana Journal of Education, published monthly in New Orleans and jointly 
edited by a former State superintendent and the present city superintendent of New 
Orleans, maintained in its third year its high standard of usefulness, giving valuable in- 
formation to the teachers and efficient aid to the educational interests of the State. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The two high schools in New Orleans continued their 3-year courses in the English 
branches. From the girls’ school 37 pupils graduated in 1882; there was no class from 
the boys’ school. In the boys’ school there were 4 teachers and 80 pupils; while the 
girls numbered 138, with 5 teachers. Average daily attendance: boys, 68; girls, 114. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and schools for preparing 
students for college, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and summaries of these 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, BatongRouge 
(non-sectarian), offers two courses, a classical and a scientific, of 4 years each, as well 
as agricultural and mechanical, of 2 years each. Military discipline is maintained. 
Residents of the State, on passing an entrance examination, are entitled to admission 
without distinction as to race or color. In 1882 there were 48 students taking the clas- 
sical course, with 52 preparing for it, and 50 in the scientific department, with 29 in 
preparatory. The degree of B. A. was conferred upon two young men at the last com- 
mencement. 
The University of Louisiana, New Orleans (non-sectarian), adopted by the constitution 
of 1879 as a State institution, had academical, medical, and legal departments, the first 
mentioned having schools of English, Greek, Latin, French, German, physics and me- 
chanics, chemistry, &c. There were 250 students in this department and its adjunct 
high school, 77 of them collegiate; instructors, 12. The degrees conferred are B. A.,B. 
s., and B. LIT., and students were advised to arrange their studies with a view to taking 
one of these. From the preparatory school, containing 173 students, 12 young men grad- 
uated in 1882 and entered the senior classes of the academic department. 
Leland University, New Orleans (Baptist), had @ new building in progress costing 
$12,000, largely the gift of Mr. Chamberlain, the founder, who also deeded the trustees 
property valued at $25,000 for the endowment of the institution. 
Other institutions of this class were Centenary College, Jackson (Methodist Episcopal 
South); Straight University, New Orleans (Congregational); New Orleans University, 
New Orleans (Methodist Episcopal); Jefferson College, College Point, Convent P. 0.; 
St. Charles College, Grand Coteau; and the Jesuits’ College, New Orleans (Roman
-P-A-G-E-387
  LOUISIANA. 93 
Catholic). All provided substantially 4-year classical collegiate courses, with a fair pro- 
portion of scientific studies. Each of the Roman Catholic colleges gave a 4-year com- 
mercial course. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
New Orleans, Leland, and Straight Universities, the three Protestant institutions at 
New Orleans, gave equal privileges to young women. For information relative to schools 
exclusively for women, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The report from the State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, at 
Baton Rouge, shows a 4-year scientific and a 2-year agricultural and mechanical course, 
following preparatory studies. The University of Louisiana, at New Orleans, and other 
colleges, as before stated, give scientific instruction in connection with classical. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.—Straight University, for the education of colored people, reported for 1882 
a class of 16 students taking the 3-year course in theology, New Orleans and Leland 
Universities also present courses in theology, the former of 3 years, the latter of 2. For 
statistics of schools of this class, see Table XI of the appendix. 
Legal.—The University of Louisiana and Straight University each gave a coutse of 2 
years in legal instruction. In the former there were 27 students; in the latter, 28. For 
statistics, see Table XII of the appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Louisiana Institute for the Education of the Deafand Dumb, Baton Rouge, reported 
for 1881~’82 50 pupils, 23 of them young women, all under 3 instructors; 8 pupils and 
1 teacher were semi-mutes. The boys are required to cut wood or work in the garden 
an hour a day, besides being taught printing or carpentry. The girls in charge of the 
matron are taught to sew and are drilled in habits of care and neatness in all the duties of 
housekeeping. The school hours are from 8 A. M. tol P. M., and the method of in- 
struction combines oral and manual. 
No statistics for 1881~’82 of institutions for the training of the blind are at hand. 
ART CULTURE. 
The Southern Art Union and Christian Woman’s Exchange, New Orleans, appears to 
be doing good work in the way of art culture. Among the 75 pupils taught during the 
year were many who made rapid progress in sketching from life and in learning to paint 
and draw from nature. 
A gonservatory of music was organized which had over 100 pupils, with 15 classes 
and 18 professors. Musical instruction was also given at the Philharmonic Society bya 
single teacher.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTFM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State there is a superintendent of common schools, who is also superintendent 
of the State normal schools; for each township or plantation, a superintending school 
committee or a supervisor; for each school district in these towns or plantations, a school 
agent. The offices of member of superintending committee and supervisor of pores are 
open to women. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The common schools of the State, of all grades, are for the free instruction of resident 
youth 4 to 21, and youth 9 to 15 are required to attend at least 12 weeks each year unless
-P-A-G-E-389
  
MAINE. 95 
excused by the school authorities. The studies (except in high schools established before 
February 24, 1873) are the ordinary English branches prescribed by the State superin- 
tendent and taught from text books selected by the town committees or supervisors. 
Text books are not to be changed oftener than once in five years except by vote of the 
town. Teachers are examined and licensed by the superintending school committees and 
are required to report to them. The expenses of the schools are defrayed out of an ap- 
propriation equal to 6 per cent of the State school fund, aided by a State tax on savings 
bank deposits of 2} mills on the dollar and a State tax of 1 mill on the dollar on all other 
property, with loeal taxes of at least 80 cents for each inhabitant. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1881-’82 compared with those of 1880-’81 show a loss of 920 in school 
population and of 2,079 in enrolment, but an increase of 11,688 in average daily attend- 
ance. In view of these remarkable figures Superintendent Luce says that the almost con- 
stant decrease in school youth that has characterized the last 20 years goes on, though 
the decrease for the year was less than the average for some preceding years. Should 
this continue for another decade the condition of the schools in the older rural sections 
will be deplorable, for in those sections the decrease has been most marked. Already 
in many of the farming towns the majority of the schools register not more than a dozen 
pupils. The marked decrease in enrolment, he admits, is difficult to account for, espe- 
cially in connection with the large increase in average attendance; but he suggests that 
as many pupils in the rural towns not only attend school in their own districts but also 
in the neighboring ones, they are counted but once as enrolled and counted twice in reg- 
istered and daily attendance, so that increase in daily attendance does not, of necessity, 
indicate an increase of individual pupils. He relies upon the actual increase in 
aggregate daily attendance as measuring the productive work of the schools, and thinks 
that as a whole the statistics of attendance show a healthier condition of school affairs 
than in the preceding year. 
Statistics of graded schools appear for the first time. The ungraded schoolsimproved 
in the scope and character of their work. A large increase in female teachers was not 
deemed indicative of less effective work, inasmuch as many of these were experienced, 
and districts were able to secure first class female teachers at less cost than third class 
male teachers. The abolition of the ‘‘ outgrown, wasteful, inequitable, and iniquitous 
school district system ’’ is said to have made slow progress during theyear, only 2 towns 
haying changed to the town plan. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the superintendent 
seated the statistics for the year as indicating that the schools were moving toward a 
higher state of efficiency. As compared with last year, the attendance had been more 
regular; better teachers had better appliances; instruction was broader and more prac- 
tical; the schools were carefully and wisely supervised, and their financial management 
‘was more economical.— (State report. )

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Auburn for 1882 reported 30 school buildings, 2 less than the previous year, with 2,200 
sittings, and entire school property valued at $105,000. Enrolment decreased 412 and 
expenditure increased $3,219. Schools were classed as primary, grammar, high, and 
rural mixed; they were in session 175 of the 180 school days. Estimated enrolment in 
private and parochial schools, 25.— (Return. ) 
Augusta reported 28 school buildings instead of the 33 of 1881 (probably from an ad- 
ditional building, erected during the year at a cost of $20,000, having accommodated the 
pupils of some smaller schools); but the value of school property rose to $75,000. There 
was a falling off of $9,547 in expenditure.— (State report.) 
Bangor, for its school population of 5,390, had 35 school buildings, 1 less than the year 
before. Notwithstanding the loss of the high school building by fire, school property 
was rated at $122,000, or $47,000 more. In school population and enrolment there was 
a slight falling off from 1881, but an addition of 3 teachers and of $1,153 in expendi- 
ture. One special teacher in penmanship was employed. The superintending school 
committee reported a year of earnest work, though serious inconvenience was experienced 
from the burning of the chief school building. The experiment of the previous year in 
placing all the schools above the intermediate grade under the control of a principal had 
proved a marked success. Two ungraded schools were opened, to which were sent from 
the grammar schools such pupils as had failed to maintain their standing. The standard 
for promotion established the year before had been sustained. The school year was 
lengthened from 34 to 36 weeks.—(City report and return. ) 
Bath had 14 school buildings, 2 less than in 1881, 13 of them in good repair. The 
entire school property of the city was valued at $59,300. Enrolment increased 79; ex- 
penditure, $285. Schools were in session 204 days of the school year.— (State report. ) 
Biddeford reported 26 school buildings, a gain of 3, but the same number of sittings, 
1,835, and the same estimated value of school property, $95,000. There was a loss of 17 
in enrolment, of 43 in average daily attendance, and of 4 teachers. Schools were taught 
184 days.— (State report and city return.) 
Lewiston reported 29 school buildings, the same as in 1881, and entire school property 
valued at $174,700. There was a loss of 381 in enrolment, of 357 in average daily 
attendance, and of 7 teachers, with a decrease of $570 in expenditures. One special 
teacher of music was employed. Schools were taught 183 days. The estimated enrol- 
ment in private and parochial schools was 500.— (City report and return.) 
Portland reported for the year ending March 6, 1882, the erection of 1 school building, 
costing $21,720, giving to all school property the value of $370,000, an increase of 
$20,000 over 1881. ‘The schools were taught by 131 teachers for 190 days, and classed 
as primary, grammar, and high, with 1 ungraded and 1 for the deaf. Compared with 
1880-81, there was a gain of 129 in enrolment and of 7 teachers, and a loss of 91 in 
average daily attendance, owing to contagious diseases; while expenditure was increased 
$10,432. The chairman of the school committee says that the schools were in a more 
satisfactory condition than a year ago, although no marked change for the better could 
be expected in one year, in view of the excellence which their schools had attained. 
‘With less corporal punishment, truancy had in a measure been kept under control. T:o 
special teachers in music and penmanship and drawing were employed. Estimated 
enrolment in private and parochial schools, 1,200.— (State and city reports. ) 
Rockland, so far as reported, shows no advance from the few statistics of 1880-81. 
The oO classed as primary, grammar, and high, were in session 150 days.— (State 
report. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL AND TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The normal schools at Castine, Farmington, Gorham, and the training school at Mad- 
awaska, all under the care of the State, are reported as having about the same attendance 
as in 1880-81. Though the attendance was less than it should be, theschools did valua- 
ple work, having 498 students, under 21 teachers, and having graduated 84 in 1882, of 
whom 78 were teaching in the State. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The practice school at Portland, sustained by the city, had 3 teachers, with 9 female 
students, and graduated 8, all of whom engaged in teaching. In a similar school at 
Lewiston 7 teachers were graduated. For local reasons, this school was discontinued at 
the close of 1881-’82.

TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
' Under the new law of 1881 changing the time of teachers’ institutes to two days in- 
stead of five, teachers’ associations were organized in every county in the State where 
they did not already exist. During the year there were 25 meetings, and the year’s trial 
indicated the superiority of the shorter term over the former one. Nearly 2,000 teachers 
were thus associated, the number doubling in one year. As a specimen of the working 
of these institutes, the outline of the one held at Bethel, Oxford County, in December, 
1882, isgiven. The first subject presented was “‘ Opening’ exercises: their purposes, char- 
acter, and methods of conducting them.’’ Next came * Practical exercises in arithme- 
tic,’’ followed by ‘‘Arithmetic for practical ends.’’? Then camean essay on ‘‘Moralsand 
manners,’’ another on ‘“‘ Reviews: their purposes, frequency, and methods,’ follovved 
by still another on ‘School government: its purposes, means, ends, and methods.’? In 
closing, examples in reading and gesture were given by aclass trained by Miss Mary M. 
Parker, teacher of elocution. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
FREE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Free high schools in Maine are not a required part of the public school system, it being 
optional with towns and districts whether they will have such schools. In some cases 
they have become part of a graded system, though such cases are exceptional. A vote 
to establish one remains in force onlya year. The superintendent says that these schools 
have been growing in public favor; forten years they have existed in their present form, 
and have come to stay in some form. They are a necessity to the common schools below 
them and the seminaries and colleges above them. In 1881 there were 101 towns that 
had them, in 1882 there were 109, at a cost in 1881 of $69,469 and in 1882 of $88,372, 
enrolling 7,792 in 1881 and 10,374 in 1882.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR BOTH SEXES. 
Bowaoin College, Brunswick (Congregational), reported for 1881-’82 a faculty of 14 pro- 
fessors (3 non-resident), with 147 students in its 4-year collegiate course, in the junior 
and senior years of which a wide range of elective studies is allowed. For the depart- 
ments of engineering, medicine, and military science, see Scientific and Professional In- 
struction, next page. Facilities for graduate instruction are provided for such as desire 
to pursue special studies after graduation, either with or without reference to an ad- 
vanced degree. Special students may also enter the regular classes and remain in them 
at their pleasure. Gifts of $1,500 in aid of students and $1,500 for the libraries were 
received during the year. There were 44 specific scholarships, which were based on a 
fund of $46, 859.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Colby University ty, Wi aterville (Baptist), with a faculty of 9 in 1881-82, had 124 students 
in its 4-year classical course, including 8 females and 2.special students. Women are 
admitted on equal terms with men. ‘The university held 69 scholarships, with an ag- 
gregate fund of $50,000; had 17,763 bound volumes in the library, increased by 573 dur- 
ing the year, and productiv e funds amounting to $235,000. Much attention is given te 
the study of French and German, the natural sciences, art, and political economy.— 
(Catalogue and return. ) 
Bates College, Lewiston (Free-Will Baptist), reported for 1881-82 a faculty of 7 resi- 
dent and 3 non-resident professors, with 106 students in its 4-year classical course, 12 
being women, who are admitted on equal terms with men. The preparatory work is 
done in the Nicholas Latin School, which, though owned by the college, is a separate 
school and had 63 pupils in 1882. There were 24 scholarships, sustained by a fund of 
$24,000. The degree of A. B. was conferred on 24 young men and 2 young women, and 
that of A. w. on 17 young men. A library of 6,883 volumes was increased during the 
year by 1,112, and nearly $20,000 in gifts were Teceived. — (Return. )

reported a year of hard work and substantial results. Two much needed instructors 
were added, 1 in military science, the other in agriculture, thus providing in the latter 
for experimental and practical farming. In the shop decisive success was reached in vise 
and forge work, but carpentry, lathe work, &c., had not been added to the courses, for 
want of necessary buildings. At the last commencement 12 young men received the

1816, wasmoved to Bangor i in 1819, where in 1820 it graduated its first class. Up to 1880 
its graduates numbered ‘600; counting 160 other students, educated for 1 and 2 years, the 
seminary had sent out 760 ministers. A majority of these are still livi ing: 6 are college 
presidents; 13 have been college or seminary professors; 24 have been foreign and large 
numbers home missionaries. For 1881-’82 it had 5 5 professors, 28 students (of whom 7 
had a degree in letters and science), and 11 graduated from the 3-year full course of 36 
weeks each. An examination is required for admission. ‘There were 15,500 volumes in 
the library, of which 300 were added during the year.— (Statement and return.) 
The Bates Theological School, Lewiston (Free ‘Will Baptist), in 1881-82 had 4 pro-

The Portland School for Medical Instruction is a high grade preparatory school not 
conferring degrees. It was organized in accordance with resolutions adopted by the 
American Medical Association, approving the establishment of private schools to meet 
the increasing desire of students for a higher grade of professional instruction than can 
be had by the usual study with a single instructor. The report fcr 1881-82 shows 11 
professors and 19 students, 6 having a degree in letters or science, aud year course of 
32weeks each. An examination in English, Latin, and physics is required for admission.

REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION, 
The State Reform School, Portland, admits boys 8 to 16 for any offence not punishable 
by imprisonment for life. In 1881~’82 there were 17 employed as officers, teachers, and 
assistants; 110 inmates, 106 native born and 4 foreign; 30 were committed and 33 dis- 
charged during the year. Since its establishment, 1,711 have been committed. The 
common English branches, including book-keeping and vocal music, were taught in 
school; the industries were baking, cane seating, house and laundry work, sewing, gar- 
dening, and farming. Many released on ‘‘ticket of leave’? had been placed in good 
homes and some indentured until 21 years of age. The library contained 1,600 vol- 
umes.— (Return.) 
The Maine Industrial School for Girls, Hallowell, was designed as a place of refuge for 
girls 7 to 15, who by force of circumstances are in danger of becoming outcasts from 
society. During the year 1881—’82 there were 44 inmates, 18 committed, 5 returned, 18 
sent to homes provided for them, and 4 married. Since 1875 148 had been received, 
112 sent to homes, 32 returned tor a new trial, and 81 were in homes provided for them. 
A flower garden was one of the attractive features of the home, the whole work in it being 
done by the inmates, besides a large amount of sewing and knitting. Under the good 
discipline, running away had ceased, no locks were used, and as much freedom as possi- 
ble was given to the girls.x— (Report, 1882.)

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
MAINE PEDAGOGICAL SOCIETY. 
The Maine Pedagogical Society was organized in 1875, and, having similar aims to 
those of the Maine Educational Association, took its place in 1881, when the latter went 
out ofexistence. The third annual meeting of the society was held at Portland, and its 
first session opened in the afternoon of November 9, 1882; with Prof. H. L. Chapman, 
of Bowdoin College, in the chair, many of the prominent educators in the State being 
present. Hon. N. A. Luce, State superintendent, gave an address on ‘‘ School supervision 
in the smaller towns,’’ in which he defined the duties of school supervisors. 
At the evening session, Professor Chapman, delivered the annual address on “‘ The 
duty and the opportunity of the teacher in respect to the development of character in the 
pupil.” Hesaid that our conception of the teacher’s duty is determined by our theory of 
education. The end of education is not reached when the intellect is informed and the 
reasoning power disciplined, as the intellect is not the man. To realize the object for 
which schools have been endowed, they should be something more than training places 
of special aptitudes or magazines of multitudinous facts. More and more will society 
distrust these educational agencies if they do not send forth successive generations of 
young people fitted to act wisely in the social conditions under which their lives must 
be passed. One of the foremost thinkers says: ‘‘It has come to be one of the chief en- 
deavors of educational thought of to-day to go deeper, and moralize as well as mental- 
ize children, and to develop the will as the chief factor of character.’? The teacher who 
does not aim to furnish the pupil with this equipment fails to appreciate the true ends 
of his calling. This idea of the teacher’s mission of to-day was elaborated with much 
clearness and force. 
Principal C. C. Rounds, of Farmington Normal School, then gave an account of the 
last session of the National Educational Association. Prof. E. W. Hall, of Colby Univer- 
sity, read a paper on ‘‘Admission to college on certificates from fitting schools.’’ After 
a discussion of some length the opinion was unanimous that colleges should not admit 
without the certificate of the fitting school. Prof. C. H. Smith, of Bowdoin College, 
read a paper on ‘‘Instruction in geometry,” followed by a report from Mr. Rounds on 
“The study of arithmetic;’”? this by a paper on ‘‘ The use and abuse of text books,’’ 
by Dr. O. 8. Lowell, of Ellsworth High School; and this by a paper from Principal 
Woodbury, of Castine Normal School, on ‘‘ Professional enthusiasm.’’ The ‘Ranking 
system in schools’ was then discussed by Messrs. Frash, Chase, Rounds, Hon. W. J. 
Corthell, Prof. E. W. Hall, and Dr. D. O. S. Lowell, all expressing disapprobation of the 
system of marking as now practised. 
‘The officers for theensuing year having been elected and 15 new members received, the 
association adjourned. The session was said to have been of much profit to the teachers 
in attendance.— (Maine State Press. ) 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
REV. ENOCH POND, D. D. 
Rey. Enoch Pond, D. D., was born at Wrentham, Mass., July 29, 1791, and died at 
Bangor, Me., January 21,1882. He graduated at Brown University in 1812 and entered 
at once upon the study of theology with Rev. Nathaniel Emmons, at Franklin, Mass. ' 
After a pastorate of thirteen years at Auburn, Mass., and editing the Spirit of the Pil- 
grims four years, he was elected professor of theology in the Theological Seminary at 
Bangor. He held this professorship twenty-three years, when he was transferred to that 
of ecclesiastical history and made president of the institution. Resigning the professor- 
ship in 1871, he retained only the general duties of president, which office he held till 
his death, having been connected with the seminary for nearly 50 years and having 
trained 700 young men for the ministry. He was also the author of about 50 volumes 
on theological and practical themes, besides preparing 115 articles for magazines, 70 of 
which were published in the Bibliotheca Sacra.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS, 
State educational affairs are in the hands of a State board of education, composed of the 
governor and 4 persons appointed by him, with the president of the State Normal School, 
who is ex officio secretary and executive officer of the board and superintendent of public 
instruction ; county school affairs are managed by boards of 3 school commissioners, 
appointed for 2 years by the judges of the circuit courts, this number being increased to 
5 in counties having over 100 schools; district schools are under boards of 3 trustees 
selected by the commissioners, 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The schools for whites are supported from the income of a free school fund and from a 
State tax of 10 cents on each $100 of taxable property. If in any county these funds 
should prove insufficient to keep the schools open for the legal term of 10 months the 
commissioners are required to levy suth a tax on the property of the county as will make 
good the deficiency, but not to exceed 10 cents on $100 unless with the approval of the 
county commissioners. If in any county on the 31st day of December the term for the 
year has been less than 73 months, such county forfeits its instalment of the State school  
-P-A-G-E-395
MARYLAND. 101 
vaxin April. Theschools for colored youth receive a State appropriation of $100,000 annu- 
ally, and all the taxes paid by colored people for educational purposes are devoted to the 
support of colored schools. The funds for both races are distributed on the basis of the 
number of youth 5 to 20 years of age; but the legal age for free attendance for whites is 
6-21 and for colored 6-20. It is the duty of the county school board to establish in 
each election district one or more public schools for colored youth. These schools are 
under the direction of a special board of school trustees, appointed by the county com- 
missioners. If the average attendance does not fall below 15 they may be taught as long 
as the other public schools of the county. Orthography, reading, writing, geography, 
arithmetic, history of the United States, and good behavior are required studies in the 
schools for both races; other branches may be added when deemed expedient by the board 
of trustees. County commissioners select the school books, which must contain nothing 
of a partisan or sectarian character. The system provides for high schools, teachers’ insti- 
tutes, and a State normal school. Aid from public funds is also given to several colleges, 
which are required to make annual report to the State superintendent. The law recom- 
mends the establishment of district, county, and State teachers’ associations; also, of 
district libraries, the latter receiving each $10 annually from county funds, provided 
the people of the district raise the same amount for the purpose. Teachers, in order to 
receive pay for services, must report quarterly to the county commissioners; county 
boards mustreportannually to the State board, and the latter tothe governor. ‘Teachers, 
unless graduates of the State Normal School, musthave a certificate of qualification from 
the county examiner, the principal of the State Normal School, or the State board of 
education. ‘Teachers for schools of high grade are trained in 4 colleges aided by the 
State. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The board of education reports another year of successful work by the public schools, 
and evidences of advance appear in almost every item of the above summary. The 
number of pupils enrolled increased by more than a thousand, and the number in aver- 
age daily attendance by nearly 3,500; more teachers were employed, more schools were 
taught, and more money was expended on them. The report calls attention to the inad- 
equacy of teachers’ pay in some of the schools and to the very small enrolment in a num- 
ber of schools, a single county reporting 21 schools with an average attendance ranging 
from 1to8. The law allows schools having less than 10 pupils in average attendance to 
be closed, but closing one is always unpopular, and school commissioners are reluctant to 
resort to it. It is suggested that in such cases the law might allow teachers to receive 
full pay for the first term and for succeeding ones pay in proportion to the average 
attendance, or else that the smaller schools: be taught. for a number of terms propor- 
tional to the attendance, the same teacher thus being employed in two or more schools. 
The necessity for some provision to secure statistics in regard to the number of pupils 
of school age in the State is presented by the report and a plan is proposed similar to one 
used in an adjoining State, in which it is made the duty of the principal teacher in every 
school district to make annually an enumeration of all the children in the district of 
school age. Itis suggested also that information be added as to the causes of non-attend- 
ance. The superintendent remarks that such a plan, besides securing the desired infor- 
mation, would bring teachers into direct contact with parents and afford them an oppor- 
tunity to explain to careless and indifferent parents the advantages their children lose 
by non-attendance. 
In consequence of the complaint of a parent whose son had been unmercifully whipped 
for having missed lessons, the general question of corporal punishment in school came 
before the board for consideration. The result developed a decided opinion on the part 
of members that the best school management discards the rod. But in consideration of 
the faulty home training of many children it was believed that the abolition by law of 
corporal punishment would not promote the welfare of the schools at present. It was 
decided, however, that for missed lessons it is not a proper punishment, and no teacher 
will be sustained who resorts to it to correct scholars delinquent only in that respect. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF BALTIMORE. 
OFFICERS. 
The schools of Baltimore are controlled by a board of 20 school commissioners, 
appointed by the city council for 4 years, 5 going out each year. The board appoints a 
superintendent of public instruction for the city, who serves 4 years, devoting his whole 
time to the work; likewise, an assistant superintendent. 
STATISTICS. 
Population, census of 1880, 332,313; children of school age, 86,961; enrolment in 
public schools, 48,277; average daily attendance, 29,178; number of teachers, 818; ex- 
penditure, $692,740.

  102 REPORT OF THE’ COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
’ A DDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The above statistics include 121 public schools, of which 14 for colored pupils had an 
attendance of 4,314. Sixty of the white schools were of primary grade and had 
15,521 pupils; re grammar schools, with 10,586; 5, with over 3,000 pupils, had 
been formerly E n-German schools; 2 were high schools for girls numbering 947 
pupils; while the city college for boys had 596. These schools were taught in 65 different 
buildings, of which the city owned 62; estimated valuc, about $1,200,000, Liberal ap- 
propriations were made during the year for the erection of new buildings and the repair 
of old, but still more money will be needed to make some of those in use comfortable and 
suited to their purpose. Additional and better accommodations were especially needed 
for the primary schools; had they been provided, more pupils would have attended the 
schools during the year. The number of different pupils in all the schools increased by 
1,229, but the average attendance was lower, haying been diminished by the prevalence 
of an epidemic, The percentage of attendance was about the same as during the pre- 
vious year, ranging from 76.6 in the colored schools to 92.3 in the city college, and av- 
eraging 82in all. The average cost per capita for education was $17.70. Teachers’ asso- 
ciations, which meet monthly for professional improvement, and public libraries for the 
use of teachers and pupils, are a part of the school system. The schools are reported to 
be generally in good condition, giving evidence of progress and success. Discipline was 
good; while corporal punishment was not prohibited, the annual summary of cases 
showed that it was inflicted much less than formerly, the schools being satisfactorily con- 
trolled by other means. The primary and grammar schools, enrolling as they do a very 
large proportion of all the pupils, receive special attention from the board and superin- 
tendents. Each of these had 6 grades, requiring 3 years for completion, so that the child 
who enters the primary at the age of 7 generally finishes the grammar school course at 
13. Physical training is not forgotten, a portion of each day being devoted to calis- 
thenic exercises; and not more than 2 hours a day need be given by any giade of pupils 
to study out of school.— (City report.)     
    
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Maryland State Normal School, the chief agency for the training of teachers in 
this State, has been from its organization in 1866 steadily and sometimes liberally sup- 
ported by the legislature. From the first, when 11 anxious pupils gathered around a 
no less anxious master in a rented hall, till 1882, when about 300 met 12 teachers in one 
of the most comfortable and best appointed school-houses in the country, there has been 
no change of administration or of plan. The principal has been at his post for 17 years, 
the vice principal for 16, and two other teachers 5 and 10 years respectively. During 
1881~82 there were 38 graduated from the course of study, which extends over 3 years, 
all but 3 of whom engaged in teaching. Diplomas, conferred after one year of success- 
ful work as teachers, authorize employment in the public schools without further exam- 
ination. Tuition is free to 200 State scholars. 
OTHER NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The Baltimore Normal School for the Education of Colored Teachers is reported to be in a 
very flourishing condition, with 6 teachers, 142 pupils on the roll, and a total enrolment 
during the year of 150; 25 of them in normal studies. There was a library of 1,100 good 
books in constant use by the pupils. Over 150 of the pupils of the school have been em- 
ployed to teach at different times and in various localities of Maryland, Virginia, and 
North Carolina. An annual appropriation of $2,000 is made by the State, and the results 
from this expenditure are more satisfactory than could have been expected.— (State report 
and return.) 
The Centenary Biblical Institute, Baltimore, a Methodist school for the education of col- 
ored preachers and teachers, reports a normal department in which only those studies 
are required in which candidates for positions in grammar schools must pass; but this de- 
partment is intended only to meet the emergencies of the present.— (Report, 1882.) 
TEACHERS’ INSTI1 ‘ES. 
  The law requires a teachers’ institute to be held in each county once a year, to con- 
tinue in session 5 days and to be presided over by the principal or one of the professors 
of the State Normal School, if he can be present, assisted by the county examiner. It 
appears, however, that this law has not been carried out in all portions of the State. 
The school authorities are not always convinced of the necessity of such meetings, and it 
has not been thought advisable to hold an institute without the hearty approbation of 
county school boards.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
High schools or high school departments are reported by the State board as existing 
in 12 of the 23 counties. All the counties, however, report pupils in geometry and phi- 
losophy; 22 had students in algebra and physiology, and 21 in book-keeping. In 19 
counties Latin was studied by over 600 pupils; in 2, Greek by 25; and in 2, French 
by 92. The course varies greatly in the different counties, since, although high schools 
are recognized as a part of the public school system, the law does not define what con- 
stitutes one. Some give adequate preparation for college in English, classics, and math- 
ematics; in others the course is only an extension of the district school to a seventh, 
eighth, or ninth grade. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
State aid was given during the year to 15 academies and academic schools, amounting 
in all to $11,229. Of 788 students attending, 194 studied Latin; 32, Greek; 42, French; 
30, German; 180, algebra, and 87, geometry. Pupils were also reported in trigonometry, 
natural philosophy, chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, logic, rhetoric, English lit- 
erature, and instrumental music. 
For statistics of these and other secondary schools reporting to this Office, see Tables 
IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; and for summaries, see corresponding tables in the re- 
port of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, liberally endowed by the merchant whose name it 
bears and opened in 1876, presents two distinct departments, undergraduate, or colle- 
giate, and university. Of 175 students enrolled during 1881—’82 under 43 instructors 
and lecturers, 99 (including 21 fellows) were university students, graduates of 50 colle- 
giate institutions; 45 were undergraduates, candidates for the degree of A. B.; and 31 
were admitted as special students to pursue courses for which they were fitted without 
regard to graduation, Of the whole number, 97 were residents of Maryland, 68 came 
from 21 other States, and 10 trom foreign countries. 
Tn the organization of this institution, the funds being ample and unrestricted, it was 
decided to follow no existing model but to create a true American university, The aim 
has been to select the ablest teachers whose services could be secured; to keep them free 
from petty cares and encourage them in original research; to maintain a high standard 
of matriculation and graduation; to allow wide latitude in respect to the choice of courses 
of instruction; and to give special facilities, such as fellowships and scholarships, to 
those who show unusual ability in any department of study. In the undergraduate 
department 8 different courses have been marked out and so arranged that before gradu- 
ation all will have been trained in mathematics, Latin, German, French, and English, 
in one branch of science, and in some branch of historical or philosophical investigation. 
Graduate students are received with or without reference to candidacy for a degree and 
attend such lectures and exercises as they prefer and are fitted for. The university pro- 
fessors give personal counsel and instruction. Books and instruments adapted to inves- 
tigation and advanced work have been liberally provided. The system of fellowships 
secures the presence of 20 students imbued with the university spirit, Seminaries, lim- 
ited to a few advanced students, have been organized in Greek, mathematics, physics, &e. ; 
societies devoted to philology, the sciences, metaphysics, and historical and political 
science afford opportunities forthe presentation of original communications; there are 
clubs for the discussion of various topics; and lectures by specialists. Select libraries for 
the use of scholars are accessible. The university reading room is well supplied and every 
pa not only to instruct, but to encourage original inyestigation.— (University 
Register. 
Besides Johns Hopkins University, which stands first among institutions for superior 
instruction, 10 colleges report, of which 4 receive a regular annual appropriation from the 
State. These are St. John’s College, Annapolis; Washington College, Chestertown; Fred- 
erick College, Frederick; and Western Maryland College, Westminster. The last named 
is under Methodist control, the other 3are unsectarian. All 4 report to the State authori- 
ties 337 pupils, a total of $20,290 received from the State, and in return 58 free scholarships 
given. These are for students selected by county boards, after competitive examination, 
and are good for the full course of 4 years, the holders being pledged to complete it and to 
teach in the public schools of the State at least 2 years after graduation, The remaining col- 
leges are Baltimore City College, already noted under Secondary Instruction, but present- 
ing acollegiate course of 3 years; Loyola College, Baltimore, Rock Hill and St. Charles Col- 
   
-P-A-G-E-398
  104 . REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
leges, Ellicott City, and Mt. St. Mary’s College, Emmittsburg (all 4 Roman Catholic); and 
New Windsor College, New Windsor, non-sectarian. The course of study in these 10 col- 
Jeges remains essentially the same as reported for 1880-’81. All make provision for pre- 
paratory work and present classical courses extending in most cases over 4 years, 5 adding 
scientific courses of from 3 to 4 years. St. John’s had a graduate course of 2 years and 
reports additional facilities for scientific instruction; Washington, a special course for non- 
matriculates; and Loyola, Rock Hill, Mt. St. Mary’s, and New Windsor had commercial 
courses. Only two, New Windsor and Western Maryland Colleges, receive young women, 
providing for them separate departments and 3-year courses. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Special facilities for scientific study are afforded by the Maryland Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, College Hill, the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, and 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, while, as already noted, courses in general science 
are presented by 5 of the other colleges, viz, St. John’s, Baltimore City, Rock Hill, Fred- 
erick, and New Windsor. 
The Maryland Agricultural College reports 40 students under 6 instructors, a decrease 
for the year of 15 students and 1 instructor. The withdrawal of the usual annual State 
donation of $6,000 made it necessary to add $75 to the annual charge for each student, 
and thus the enrolment fell off. This failure to afford the usual aid resulted, as the 
trustees were assured, from no dissatisfaction with the administration of the affairs of 
the college, but simply from an opinion that agricultural colleges are not required. Not- 
withstanding the discouragement resulting from this action, the several departments of 
the college were in good condition, even better than ever before. The faculty agreed 
to a reduction of 20 per cent. in their already mederate salaries, all the farm hands but 
one were discharged and the work done by students, and 7 young men who came well 
recommended were allowed board, tuition, and all other expenses in consideration of 
5 hours’ labor from them each day on the farm. Military tactics, as required by law, re- 
ceives some attention in the course of study; English literature is studied by all; Greek, 
by 2; Latin, by 8; French, by 6; and German, by 10. 
In the United States Naval Academy the course of study, comprising 4 years at the acad- 
emy and 2at sea, includes, besides literary and linguistic branches, all the higher mathe- 
matics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, dynamics, navigation, surveying, and steam engi- 
neering. The number of cadet midshipmen allowed at the academy is one for every mem- 
ber and delegate of the House of Representatives, who nominate them, and one for the 
District of Columbia and 10 at large, nominated by the President ofthe United States. In 
addition to these, 25 cadet engineers may be appointed each year by the Navy Depart- 
ment, after a competitive examination, those who possess the greatest skilland experience 
in the practical knowledge of machinery having precedence. The course of study for 
engineers, as for midshipmen, comprises 4 years at the academy and 2 atsea. Graduates 
are commissioned as assistant engineers in the Navy as vacanciesoccur. The stipulated 
age for engineers on entering is 16 to 20; that for midshipmen, 14 to 18. 
Johns Hopkins University furnishes opportunities for advanced scientific study and in- 
vestigation in itsgraduate department, while the undergraduate presents two courses in 
which general scientific studies are pursued, viz, a scientific and a mathematical course, 
the latter being intended for those who prefer mathematical studies with reference to en- 
gineering, astronomy, &c. Of 175 students in the university during 1881-82 there were 
33 engaged in mathematical studies, 24 in physics, 44 in chemistry, and 32 in biology. 
The university is provided with 3 scientific laboratories, fully equipped. Chemistry has 
aspecial building, with facilities for about 40 workers, and a wellselected library. The 
physical department is furnished with apparatus from the best European and American 
makers. It was selected with especial reference to investigations, and is particularly 
valuable for researches in respect to electricity, magnetism, light, and heat. The bio- 
logical laboratory, occupying the entire upper story of the university building, includes 
a general laboratory, several private work rooms, anda lecture room and cabinet. Over 
$43,000 have been expended for scientific apparatus. 
For statistics of scientific schools, see Table X of the appendix, and for a summary, see 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
The theological schools in this State are the Theological Seminary of St. Sulpice, Bal- 
timore, the Ecclesiastical Seminaries of St. Mary’s College, Emmittsburg, St. Clement’s 
College, chester, and Woodstock College, Woodstock, all four Roman Catholic, and 
Centenary Biblical Institute, Baltimore for colored men, under Methodist infiuence.    
-P-A-G-E-399
MARYLAND. 105 
The courses of study reported by the first named four are, respectively, of 5, 4, 6, and 7 
years, but the portion which is strictly professional does not appear. The course in Cen- 
tenary Institute extends over 9 years, 3 of these being theological. For statistics of the- 
ological schools, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary, see the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
The law department of the University of Maryland reports 64 students, of whom 15 
had received a degree in letters or science, and 30 graduates in 1882. The course of 
study comprises 2 years of 32 weeks each. There are four examinations each session, 
and in order to be graduated students must attain a grade of at least 75 per cent. in all 
the examinations. For fuller statistics, see Table XII of the appendix. 
Four schools of medicine are reported from this State, all ‘‘regular”’ and all in Balti- 
more, viz, the School of Medicine of the University of Maryland, the College of Physi- 
cians and Surgeons, Baltimore Medical College, and the Woman’s Medical College of 
Baltimore. 
The School of Medicine of the University of Maryland, organized in 1807, presents a 
regular course of 22 weeks and a preliminary one of 10 days, recommends but does not 
require a 3-year graded course, and for graduation requires attendance on 2 regular courses. 
During the last 6 years 40 per cent. of the matriculates have graduated. Matriculates 
for 1881~’82, 197; graduates, 73; faculty, 10. 
In the College of Physicians and Surgeons (organized in 1872) there is a regular course 
of 20 weeks and a spring course of 12, a 3-year graded course is recommended but not 
required, and there are no requirements for admission. To graduate, students must 
have a good English education and must have studied medicine 3 years and passed a 
satisfactory examination. Thirty-nine per cent. of the matriculates during the last 6 
years have graduated. Matriculates, 346; graduates, 158; faculty, 10. 
Baltimore Medical College, first opened in 1881, reports a lecture course of 30 weeks 
annually. Students, in order to graduate, must attend two of these courses and must 
pass an examination in the 7 branches of medical study. An examination in English 
studies is required of applicants for admission who are not graduates of some literary or 
medical school. Matriculates, 46; graduates, 17; faculty, 10. 
The Woman’s Medical College of Baltimore, organized in 1882, provides sessions of 28 
weeks, advises a 3-year graded course, and as an inducement thereto offers free tuition 
during the third year; requires for admission an examination in English branches; for 
graduation, attendance on 2 full courses of lectures on clinics, at least 1 dissection, and 
an examination in all the branches of the course of study. Faculty, 8; matriculates, 19. 
Besides the above, Johns Hopkins University, in a course preparatory to medical 
study, affords opportunity for students expecting to take up the study of medicine to 
become proficient in laboratory work while continuing their general education. Besides 
modern languages and other collegiate studies, the course includes physics, chemistry, 
and biology, the last being the dominant subject. 
Dentistry is taught in the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery and the dental depart- 
ment of the University of Maryland. The former, organized in 1839, reports 1,906 stu- 
dents since then; 89 present during 1881-’82, of whom 10 had received degrees in letters 
or science, and 36 graduated from the 2-year course. The college removed in June, 1881, 
to new and commodious buildings. The dental department of the University of Mary- 
land, first opened October 2, 1882, presents a 2-year course of lectures, each session last- 
ing about 5 months. 
Pharmacy was taught in the Maryland College of Pharmacy, Baltimore, to 98 students, 
of whom 17 were graduated. Besides attendance on 2 sessions of the regular course of 
lectures and on one course of analytical instruction, students, to graduate, musthave served 
an apprenticeship of 4 years in the apothecary business and must have passed an exam- 
ination (under the supervision of a board of examiners assisted by the professors) in each 
a of study, at least 60 per cent. of the whole number of questions to be answered 
correctly. 
For statistics of schools of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, see Table XIII of the 
appendix, and for a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb, Frederick City, receives youth 9 to 21 
years of age and gives free board and tuition to residents of the State unable to pay. 
Instruction is given in the elementary English branches, in the elements of philosophy 
and chemistry, in algebra, drawing, speech and lip reading; also, in such industries as 
shoemaking, cabinet making, printing, and needlework. There were 89 pupils in at- 
tendance during the year, under 10 teachers; and since the foundation of the school in 
1867 instruction has been given to 248.

106 REPORT OF THE: COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Maryland Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Baltimore, reports 70 pupils 
during 1881-’82. The course of instruction consists of English branches and music, he- 
sides broom and mattress making, sewing, and knitting. Pupils remain in school from 
8 o’clock A. M. to 1 P. M,, with intermission of 10 minutes each hour; from 2 to 5 P. M. 
they are employed in the shops, sewingroom, and music classes. The age for admission 
is 9 to 18; expenses to each one, $300 a year, which is remitted, on consent of the gov- 
ernor, to those whose guardians are unable to pay. 
The colore@? blind and deaf-mutes receive instruction in an institution organized for 
them in 1872 by the directors of the institutions for the blind and the deaf and dumb 
white children assisted by the State, which makes annual appropriations for its support. 
The building formerly occupied by the institution for blind white children is commodi- 
ous, in good repair, and well adapted for the purpose. There were 28 pupils during the 
year, of whom 15 were blind and 13 deaf-mutes. Besides the public school branches, 
they were taught chair caning, broom making, sewing, and other employments adapted 
to their capacities and needs. 
  M’DONOGH INSTITUTE, 
This school, which prepares poor boys for useful occupations, considerably increased its 
accommodations in 1882 by the erection of new buildings, the expense of which en- 
croached somewhat on the principal of the endowment fund. Hence, no new pupils can 
be admitted for a time unless the trustees adopt a recommendation of the principal that 
boys of means be received, the fees from whom might add a free foundation. For the 
free pupils admission for some time has been allowed only on competitive examination, 
as, for 10 vacancies in 1872, there were nearly 70 applicants. The boys, in addition to 
instruction in school studies, work in the garden and on the farm in the afternoons and 
on Saturdays, and during the summer vacation are employed continuously in such out- 
door occupation. They are also trained in military tactics. Pupils in 1881-’82, under 
4 instructors and a principal, 50, 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING, 
There are 3 institutions for the reformation of youth under 18 (one of them for colored 
youth), besides one which receives inmates from 3 to 50 years of age, the last being under 
the control of the Roman Catholic Church, the others under State and municipal or pri- 
vate management. Of 3 industrial schools, 2 were under Roman Catholic influence, the 
other Protestant Episcopal. Two of the reformatory schools, the House of Refuge and 
House of the Good Shepherd, both in Baltimore, report a total of 421 inmates during the 
year. Most of those received into the House of Refuge were committed for incorrigi- 
bility, inveterate truancy, or for vagrancy or criminal practices. The object of the school, 
as distinctly stated, is reformation and not punishment. Besides the daily sessions of the 
schools, a portion of time is regularly devoted to industrial hand work. Systematic in- 
struction is given in music as an element of moral training. 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The schools of art and design of the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Me- 
chanic Arts made marked progress during the year. ‘The exhibition of students’ work 
in June, 1882, showed advance in work of different kinds, especially in original designs 
for wall papers and other manufactured goods. Creditable work was also exhibited in 
the higher branches of art, particularly in drawing and painting from objects and life. 
In“the lower grades applicable to industrial pursuits many young women have learned 
the art of decorating pottery, and some of them have obtained employment in decorating © 
faience, at which they can earn respectable wages. The night schools for mechan- 
ical drawing and design have increased in popularity and attendance, being, indeed, 
crowded beyond the limits of comfort. Artisans find that their surest way to promotion 
lies in a knowledge of drawing. Numerous instances have occurred of young men 
being promoted solely in consequence of being trained at these schools. The number 
attending at date of the report was about 700, under 13 teachers besides the principal.—

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association for 1882, held at Cumberland in 
August, was well attended by representative teachers from all sections of the State, as 
well as by school commissioners and county examiners. The evening sessions were also 
attended by the citizens of Cumberland, who showed marked interest in the proceedings 
and by their hospitable attentions made the occasion one to be long and pleasantly re-

membered. The papers read were appropriate, interesting, and instructive, and the dis- 
cussions which followed searching, animated, and aften eloquent.— (State report. ) 
OTHER ASSOCIATIONS. 
County and district as well as State associations are authorized and recommended by 
Jaw as important agents for the improvement of teachers and the increase of professional 
spirit; and the report says all were conducted during the year ‘‘ witha success proportioned 
to the amount of energy displayed.’’? No particulars of the different meetings are given.—

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS, 
Since 1837 the State has had a board of education for the general care of public schools. 
This board has the aid of a secretary of its own choice, for office work and general super- 
vision, and of 3 agents, for the local inspection of schools, holding of institutes, &c. Each 
town (township) has an elective school committee, for the direction and care of its schools, 
and may also have a superintendent. Cities have like arrangements. The old pruden- 
tial committees of 1 in each district of a town ceased at the close of 1882 with the aboli- 
tion, of the old district system throughout the State. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State board holds for the Commonwealth the principal of a small fund in aid of 
normal schools and disburses the income of this for such things as are not provided for 
by legislative appropriations. One half of the income of a State school fund is also dis- 
bursed by it in aid of schools in towns and cities that maintain schools for at least 6 
months each year, with a high school for 10 months where the town or city has 500 fam- 
ilies orhouseholders. ‘The other half goes for general educational purposes in connection 
with the State system. The board is authorized to prescribe the form of registers to be 
kept in the schools, and the form of the blanks and returns to be made by school com- 
mittees. Beyond this, however, it has no control of the free schools. The school com- 
mittees engage teachers, fix their salaries, direct what text books shall be used, and 
prescribe the course of studies. They procure the books for use within their schools 
and furnish them at cost to pupils, and they may, ‘under an ordinance of their city or a 
vote of their especial town, lend pupils the books they need and furnish them stationery. 
Under the State system local control of schools is dominant, while the State stimulates 
interest in them and gets full and regular reports by the distribution of a small fund. 
Nor does the State content itself with this. It endeavors to make sure that all its 
youth are educated. For this purpose it requires the taking of an annual census of the 
- children of school age; provides the needful teachers, school-houses, and funds for their 
instruction; exacts attendance on this instruction for at least 20 weeks each year by every 
child from 8 to 14 years of age not incapacitated or taught elsewhere; and provides vigi- 
lant school officers to see that the laws respecting attendance are enforced. No child 
under 10 years of age may be employed in occupations that hinder school attendance 
and no child under 14 is to be so employed, except during the vacations of the public 
schools, unless in attendance at some school for 20 weeks in the preceding year. Lest, 
after all, the schools should fail of due effectiveness through lack of sufficiently taught 
teachers, care is taken to have these teachers trained as thoroughly as possible in 6 good 
normal schools under State direction, in district institutes under agents of the State 
board, and in county as well as State associations, aided by State funds, 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
The only notable legislation for the year was an act to abolish at the close of 1882 the 
district school system, which for many years has been an incubus on progress in the 
little country neighborhoods where it had survived. This leaves the town as the unit of 
the school system and secures better supervision, with the likelihood of better schools, 
teachers, and school-houses. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Progress appears at almost every point, less marked, however, in some cases because 
of advances in 1880-’81, in which year public school enrolment rose 18,462, schools out- 
side of the public system showing a considerable loss. In 1882 the private schools seem 
to have recovered what they lost in 1881. Still, with 8,697 additional children of school 
age, the State schools received 5,182 more pupils of all ages, average membership 
being 3,411 more and average daily attendance 2,631 more. The evening schools under 
public direction enrolled 920 more pupils and had 1,150 more in average attendance. 
Academies and private schools exceeded their enrolment for the previous year by 3,954, 
the average attendance in them not being reported. In all schools, not including col- 
leges, there were thus 10,113 more youth brought under instruction than in 1881-82, 
or 1,416 more than the increase in persons of school age. To meet the increase of attend- 
ance on the public schools there were 89 more schools in use for day pupils and 10 more 
for evening pupils. The cost of the public schools, exclusive of reform schools, instruc- 
tion of the blind, deaf and dumb, &c., was $104,582 greater than in 1881. 
It is evident from the State report that there is a steady though gradual advance in the 
quality of the teaching. This is attributed by the State superintendent to the fact that 
more than a quarter of the teachers in the State free schools have been trained in normal 
schools, nearly one-fourth being graduates. The influence of such a number versed 
   
-P-A-G-E-404
  110 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in scientific methods of instruction must be beneficial to the teachers of inferior 
preparation with whom they are brought more or less in contact. The labors of the 
travelling agents of the State board of education in visiting and examining the remoter 
schools and in holding institutes for the improvement of the teachers, tend also to ele- 
vate the standard of instruction, as do the discussions of school methods in the county 
and State teachers’ associations and in the widely circulated educational periodicals. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information as to the numerous Kindergiirten in this State, see Table V of the 
appendix; for asummary of their statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES AND TOWNS WITH OVER 7,500 INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
For both cities and towns the general rule is that school committees of 3 members or 
some multiple of 3 are chosen for terms of 3 years, to have charge of the public schools. 
These committees may be changed in one-third of their membership each year. In cities 
they generally have superintendents for their schools, the mayor being ex officio chair- 
man of the board. Boston, besides a superintendent, has 6 supervisors for special parts 
of the school work.

paid out of the proceeds of taxation. b Census of 1880. ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Attleborough in 1882 regraded its larger district schools, making 4 departments, pri- 
mary, intermediate, subgrammar, and grammar. Class promotions from grade to grade 
occur at the close of the spring term, but individual promotions whenever a scholar com- 
pletes the work of any grade. High school courses of four years appear beyond these 
departments. Of the 62 teachers 20 were graduates of normal schools. With 125 more

MASSACHUSETTS. 111 
children of school age the town enrolled only 24 more pupils in public schools and had 
28 fewer in average attendance. In 3 private schools there were 60 pupils. 
Beverly, with 13 more children of school age, enrolled 14 more and had 12 more in ay- 
erage attendance. In its high school, under 4 teachers, were 131 pupils; in 2 private 
schools, 52 pupils. Of the 34 public school teachers, 7 were graduates of normal schools. 
Boston had 3,353 more children of school age, but, as far as the reportsshow, had only 
232 more enrolled in its public schools, though there were 2,017 more in average attend- 
ance. In its 11 high schools there were 2,389 pupils, under 88 instructors; in 22 private 
academic schools, 5,107 pupils; in 70 other private or church schools, 2,761. Adding 
these private pupils to the 60,000 reported in the public schools, it appears that there 
were in all 6,812 more children and youth under instruction in the city than the whole 
number éf school age, which, however, is only from 5 to 15. As to the quality of this 
instruction in the schools under the city system, Superintendent Seaver says that for 
most of the year he had been engaged in inspecting the primary schools, and from careful 
observation, visiting every room once and many twice or three times, he is convinced 
that the new methods of instruction, tried now for nearly 8 years, have borne good fruit. 
That they have not borne better is due largely, he believes, to ultra-conservatism in 
some of the old teachers, who cling tenaciously to former methods or admit new ones 
with reluctance. But he found by far the greater number enthusiastic as to the im- 
provement due to the new methods, which include much object teaching, fresh reading, 
and free use of the pencil for expressing thoughts in writing. The superintendent 
thinks he sees in the improvement made in composition in these lower schools a token 
of a coming higher standard throughout all, A more uniform standard, too, he evi- 
dently believes, has in some degree resulted from the work of the 6 supervisors, though 
it seems to him that the control of the supervisors should be guarded lest it get beyond 
bounds. Forimprovement of the teachers outside of the 600 who were graduates of normal 
schools, Colonel Parker, late of Quincy, had a well attended course of Saturday lessons on 
psychology; Mr. Hitchings, director of drawing, another course on that element of in- 
struction in the schools; and Mr. Holt, a special teacher of music, one on methods of 
teaching that subject. Twice also the superintendent called the teathers generally to- 
gether, and with the aid of the 6 supervisorsat the first meeting went over the work of the 
year, especially ‘‘methods of teaching reading.’’ As to this he warned them against a 
too exclusive use of the word-method and urged a fair employment of the phonic method 
also. At thesecond meeting ‘‘ methods of teaching music in primary schools,’ after in- 
troduction by the superintendent, were discussed by the head master of the normal school 
and the 3 special instructors in music. In 19 evening schools (one of them a high and 5 
others drawing schools) there was an average belonging of 2,839 and an average attend- 
ance of 1,636, under 107 teachers. These schools were not so expensive as in 1880-’81, a 
circumstance due to some delay in opening the high school and to the closing of poorly 
attended schools; but the interest shown was stronger and the general results better 
than in one or two preceding years. ‘Training in the use of tools was given in the Dwight 
School with great success, and in sewing in many of the schools. 
Brockton increased its school children by 190; its enrolment in public schools by 239 
(besides 30 in a private school); its average attendance by 26; its expenditure for schools 
by $17,026, $13,750 being for new school-houses. Of its 52 town teachers, 17 were nor- 
mal graduates. Its high school had 3 teachers and 125 pupils. 
Brookline, with 40 fewer children to be taught, enrolled 85 more than in 1880-81, but 
fell 26 below that year in average attendance. Its high school had 4 teachers and 119 
pupils. Seven private schools had 226 pupils. 
Cambridge, with 192 additional school children, enrolled 375 more and had 145 more in 
average attendance, spending $5,343 more for school purposes. In its high school there 
were 481 pupils, under 12 teachers. Of the 207 teachers in public schools, 116 had 
hools and 98 had graduated from them. Twenty private schools 
reported the year before showed nearly the same attendance. The city schools were: 1 
high, 8 grammar, 23 prim: 1 reformatory, and 2 evening drawing schools. Drawing 
and music formed a part of the instruction in all the day schools. An additional public 
school-house was completed in August, 1882, making 2 new ones within 2 years; but 
more are said to be needed. Improvement in the sanitary arrangements of existing 
schools was also greatly needed. 
Chelsea spent of fands from taxation $6,808 more on its public schools than in 1880-’81, 
enrolled in them 274 more, its additional school children numbering 236, and increased 
by 70 the average attendance. 
Chicopee had 2 high schools and 2 grammar schools, with intermediate, primary, and 
ungraded schools, the number of which is not given. Subject to the fluctuations in pop- 
ulation that marl manufacturing towns, its public schools fell off 194 in enrolment and 
99 in average attendance, though. 2 parochial schools had rather more than the full num- 
ber that had been reported in 5 non-public schools the year before,

  112 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Clinton enrolled 177 more pupils and had 72 more in average attendance. Its high 
school had 74 pupils, 3 more than in 1880-’81; a private school, 40, the same number as 
in that year. Evening schools were maintained. Drawing, introduced in the autumn 
of 1881, will be taught by a special teacher until the regular teachers are sufficiently 
trained to carry iton. An evening drawing school for mechanics had an average attend- 
ance of 19. Music was taught in the grammar and high schools. 
Fall River, with only 489 more children of school age, enrolled 998 more, but the aver- 
age attendance was only 286 greater than that of 1881. In other than city schools 900 
additional enrolments were reported. Seventeen evening schools, opened in December, 
1881, had an enrolment of 982 and an average attendance of 530. One of these was for 
advanced students. Respecting the - training school, see Training of Teachers, p.115. 
Fitchburg had. 8 ungraded, 12 primary, 7 secondary, 6 intermediate, and 3 grammar 
schools, with 1 high school; ‘special teachers of singing, drawing, and penmanship were 
employed ; and the course is well arranged. An evening school for teaching drawing had 
an enrolment of 72 pupils, with 43 in average attendance. A teachers’ association met 
once a month to discuss methods of teaching, &c. During the winter, grade-meetings 
were also held by the superintendent to discuss topics relating to every day work in 
teaching and to get at the experience of different teachers. The increased enrolment in 
city schools exceeded the increase of youth of school age, and the average attendance 
reached 89 per cent. of the average membership. In the high school there were 185 
pupils. Out of 72 teachers, only 12 had received a normal school training. 
Gloucester paid $12,169 less for school purposes. The high school enrolled 205 against 
145 the year before, and 2 private schools reported 70 students. No evening schools 
appear to have been held. In the day schools music and drawing were taught. Of its 100 
teachers, 38 had attended normal schools. City school buildings numbered 22, primary, 
grammar, and high. The instruction in sewing and in the use of tools, given for some 
sessions through private liberality, was discontinued in 1881. 
Haverhill had 28 more school children and enrolled 15 more, but had 86 fewer in aver- 
age attendance. Its high school had 161 pupils; 2 private schools, 60 pupils. 
Holyoke, with 373 more children, enrolled 299 additional to its previous roll, having 
187 more in average attendance. In private and church schools there were enrolled over 
a thousand pupils; in the high school there were 105; in evening schools, 622. Among 
thestudies in the day schools were music, drawing, and penmanship, all taught by special 
teachers. Language lessons continued to receive careful attention, drill in the correct 
use of English running throughout the course. Two of the schools had formed excel- 
lent libraries, one of them for pupils especially, the other rather for teachers, but with a 
department for pupilsalso. Inthe highschool more attention was given to English litera- 
ture; the study ofelocution was begun; and the facilities for laboratory practice in chem- 
istry were improved. Enthusiasm for the study of modern languages was awakened by 
the introduction of the conversational method. 
Lawrence continued to do well, showing an enrolment of 150 additional pupils in 
public schools, out of 278 more children of school age, but an average attendance of 131 
fewer than in 1880-’81. There were 1,200 pupils in upsets and church schools. The 
city high school had 246 pupils, an increase of 49. The payments for city schools were 
$15,688 more in amount than in the previous year. A new school course, entered on in 
1882, gave 3 years each for primary and grammar studies and 2 for intermediate. All 
included drawing and music. The high school had 4 courses: English, of 2 and 4 years; 
classical, of 4; and one styled ‘‘ mixed,”’ in which Latin replaces certain English studies. 
French was optional in the 4-year English and mixed courses. ‘Teachers of the city 
schools continued to be trained for their work in a 2-year course under the control of the 
city school officers. The evening schools had a drawing department for training in me- 
chanical and architectural work, which covered 2 years. There was also an evening 
high school. 
Lowell’s school population increased 903, its enrolment in city schools 175, and its 
average attendance 159. There were 1,520 pupils in an academy and in 5 church 
schools. The city high school had 398 pupils, 41 fewer than the year before. Military 
drill introduced in 1881 was continuedinit. Free text books were supplied to all. Six 
evening schools were maintained, one of them a free evening drawing school, which cost 
about $4,000. The reform school had 125 different scholars for the year 1882, 38 of them 
from the city. 
Lynn also did well, with an increase of 168 school youth enrolling 173 more and hay- 
ing 96 more in average attendance. In the city high school there were 336 pupils against 
265 the year before; in 7 private schools, 515 pupils. The public schools cost $31,622 
more; 60 of the teachers had attended normal schools, 41 being normal school graduates. 
The ordinary evening schools were suspended, but an ev ening drawing school, with 3 
teachers and 124 pupils, was maintained. Musi¢ and drawing appear to have been 
taught in all the city schools.

Malden, with a small increase of school population, enrolled in its 10 school buildings 
61 fewer pupils and had 182 fewer in average attendance, though it paid for school pur- 
poses $14,484 more than in 1880-’81 and included among its teachers 12 graduates of 
normal schools. The high school had 180 pupils; 2 private or church schools, 570. 
Marlborough reported 73 more children and enrolled in its 13 school buildings 65 more 
pupils, the average attendance falling off slightly. The number in its high school fell 
from 141 to 118. In 38 private or parochial schools there were 250, a diminution of 1 
school and 40 pupils. Only 7 of its 51 teachers were trained in normal schools. ‘ 
Medford’s school statistics disclose a slight retrograde movement generally. The high 
school/had 119 pupils; 1 private school, 20 pupils. In the free schools, 6 of the 33 teach- 
ers came from normal schools. 
Milford had 15 teachers who had received normal instruction out of 45 in all. There 
were 24 fewer children of school age, 98 fewer on the list of enrolled pupils, and 67 fewer 
in average attendance. The high school had 203 pupils, an increase of 14; 2 private 
schools, 40 pupils. ° 
Natick, with 23 teachers from normal schools out of 48 in its employ, also reported loss 
as to school children, enrolment, and average attendance, though no private schools ap- 
pear to have competed with the public. The high school enrolled 125. 
New Bedford, with a large but indeterminate increase in the number of children ot 
school age, reports in its 1 high, 3 grammar, 11 primary, 6 country, 1 mill, and 1 farm 
school an increase of 191 in enrolment and of 115 in average attendance. There was 
also some increase in the membership of private schools. Two evening schools for adults 
enrolled 250, and there was an average attendance of 21 on an evening drawing school. 
Of its 115 teachers 24 were graduates of normalschools. Drawing was continued inthe 
day schools, and Superintendent Harrington says that every boy or girl exhibiting special 
proficiency was in request long before the allotted time of schooling was over. Of the 
quality of the instruction, Professor Walter Smith, late State director of art education, 
said: “‘ New Bedford has earned the right to say that in her public day schools industrial 
drawing has been developed more practically and with more general success than in any 
other city.’’ The city high school had 236 pupils. Swain Free School, founded in 1881 by 
trustees under the will of the late William W. Swain, is meant to receive such graduates 
of local secondary schools as wish to continue their studies and ‘‘carry them on in their 
most essential and culturing pursuits to broader and higher reaches of attainment.’”? New 
Bedford will thus have substantially a free college, though it does not take that title. 
The school, at its first session, had 87 pupils, mostly in English and other modern lan- 
guage studies and in industrial art, under 3 instructors. : 
Newburyport had 66 more school youth, enrolled 99 more, and had 22 more in average 
attendance. The high school had 135 pupils, an increase of 4. The cost of city schools 
was $2,443 greater than in 1881. 
Newton paid $2,723 more for schooling its children, had 70 more of school age, enrolled 
259 additional in its city schools (besides 94 in private schools and 247 in academies), 
but showed only 17 more in average attendance than in 1880-’81. Of its teachers 23 
had attended normal schools and 19 were graduates of such schools. In its high school 
there were 313 pupils. Military drill for boys and calisthenics for girls formed a part of 
its exercises. Music and drawing were taught in all grades. Two evening schools had 
100 pupils. 
North Adams had more children of school age and a higher enrolment, but a dimin- 
ished average attendance. Its high school had 1 more teacher, but 6 fewer pupils. 
The increase in the cost of public schools was $3,111. 
Northampton enrolled only 62:more pupils, although there were 115 additional census 
children. Of its 73 teachers, 12 had spent some time at normal schools and 10 were 
graduates. Its high school had 1 more teacher, but 11 fewer pupils. There were accom- 
modations for 2,540 pupils in 26 different buildings. Music was taught in the schools, 
but not drawing, though the population exceeds 10,600 and under the State law drawing 
must be taught in the public schools of towns having over 10,000 inhabitants. s 
Peabody's number of children of school age, enrolment in the public schools, and aver- 
age attendance did not materially vary. Itshigh school had 72 pupils. The freeschools 
cost $1,234 more. 
Pittsfield reported more children 5-15 and more on its free school roll. The average 
attendance in public schools advanced 356. In the high school there were 160 pupils, 
against 96 the year before. Few of the teachers had studied in normal schools and only 
5 were graduates. Vocal music and drawing were taught by special teachers and a free 
evening drawing school was held (embracing 4 classes and enrolling 73 pupils) for in- 
struction in free hand, building construction, and machine drawing. A class of public 
* school teachers was held on Saturday afternoons for special training in the methods of 
teaching this subject. Free text books greatly aided the instruction in city schools. 
Quincy, with apparently 18 of its 64 teachers trained in normal schools, 8 of them

graduates, enrolled for this year 82 additional free school pupils, the additional children 
of school age numbering 189. Its high school had 107 pupils, against 154 in 1880-81. 
Salem, according to the figures of the State report, had in its 83 schools 1,027 fewer 
children in 1881~’82 than in 1880-81, though the school population was 38 greater. 
Yet, with this great falling off in enrolment, the average attendance was hightr by 100. 
The high school had 173 pupils, and on petition of citizens it was arranged that those 
pursuing only English studies in it should be allowed to graduate at the expiration of 
3 years, those in classical studies remaining one year longer. Music was taught, appar- 
ently, in all the schools, and drawing in at least an evening drawing school. , Two other 
evening schools were maintained, 1 for boys and 1 for girls, with special instruction of 
French speaking children. 
Somerville decreased 850 in school population and 269 in the enrolment in its 82 free 
schools, as well as 211 in average attendance on them, although it expended for these 
schools $31,699 more than in 1880-’81. In private and church schools there was also a 
decrease of pupils from 540 to 500. The high school had 842 pupils. Two evening 
schools appear in a return, but without details. 
Springfield added 420 to its youth of free school age, 147 to its previous year’s enrol- 
ment, and 73 to its average attendance in 96 common schools. Its high school, how- 
ever, had only 372 pupils, against 405 the previous year. In 7 private or church schools 
there were 470. The cost of public schools increased by $5,748. A return shows that 
the 3 evening schools reported last year were continued, enrolling 572 pupils and having 
268 in average attendance. Music, drawing, and penmanship were taught by special 
teachers. Of the city corps of teachers, 33 had had some normal training and 24 were 
graduates of normal schools. 
Taunton, with an increase of 146 school children, enrolled 210 more than in the year 
before in its 63 free schools and had 33 more in average attendance on these, while in an 
academy there were 72 and in a. lower grade private school 44. The city high school 
had 149 pupils, against 161 the previous, year. An industrial drawing school, said to 
have been highly successful, enrolled 278 pupils, 38 more than in 1880-81, and con- 
tinued for 16 weeks, 4 evenings each week. Its pupils were divided into 2 sections, each 
attending two evenings in the week separately. 
Waltham paid for school purposes -$22,242 less than in 1880-81, but, with 137 addi- 
tional children of school age, enrolled 86 more in its 38 free schools and had 54 more in 
average attendance. Its high school had 120 pupils. Two evening schools for instruc- 
tion in common English studies were maintained, with an average attendance of 52, and 
an evening drawing school, with an average of 33. Vocal music had been taught in all 
the day schools for years with excellent results, and sewing was introduced in February, 
1882, into 3 classes of the grammar schools, with great promise of future usefulness. 
Westfield increased. by $1,999 its expenditure for its 31 public schools, employed in 
them a large proportion of normally trained teachers, and though, with 55 more youth of 
schoolage, 57 fewer were enrolled, there were 33 mere in average atteudance. The high 
school enrolled 140, against 180 the year before. 
Weymouth spent $8,545 more for its 48 free schools and had 12 more children of school 
age, but it enrolled 16 fewer than the year before and the average attendance was less by 
_50._ Its high school also had 26 fewer pupils. 
Woburn’s statistics changed slightly. Recesses were abolished with the full approval of 
the pupils, Free text books, stationery, and other aids to study were supplied. The 
town high school increased its enrolment from 139 to 145, while a private school had 45 
upils. 
x Worcester, with 193 schools, paid $56,657 more than in 1880-81, enrolled 560 more 
children, and had 372 more in average attendance; besides which number there were 150 
in 2 academies and 2,000 on the rolls of 11 private er church schools. Of the teachers 
149 were normal school graduates. The city high school had 570 pupils, 31 fewer than 
the year before. Besides special teachers of music and drawing for the day schools, 6 
feehes of free evening drawing schools are reported for 1882, with 15 male and 15 
female teachers of other evening schools, apparently for the latter part of that year. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 5 State schools for ordinary normal training are at Bridgewater, Framingham, Salem, 
Westfield, and Worcester; for training in free hand, mechanical, and architectural drawing 
there is anormal art school at Boston, meant to prepare art teachers for the public schools of 
cities in the State. Inthe5 first mentioned there had been taught, up to the close of 1882, 
more than 11,400 pupils, 5,700 of whom had completed the full course, which is of 2 years 
for those that propose to teach in lower schools and of 4 for such as aim at higher grades. 
In the normal art school, since its opening in 1873, there had been 1,194, of whom 260 
/  
-P-A-G-E-409
MASSACHUSETTS. 115 
had completed the work of the first year, 82 that of the second, 23 that of the third, 
while 32 had gone through the full 4-year course and had graduated as art masters or 
art mistresses, the others getting at the close of each year a certificate of their completion 
of that year’s work. 
The number attending each school for the year was: at Bridgewater, 194; at Framing- 
ham, 84; at Salem, 239; at Westfield, 136; at Worcester, 183; at the normal art school, 
171— making a total of 1,007. The graduates for the year were: 47 at Bridgewater, 20 
at Framingham, 68 at Salem, 29 at Westfield, 33 at Worcester, and 1 at the art schoo}, 
making 198. 
At the normal art school an important change was made in the retirement of Art 
Director Walter Smith, who had been principal since 1873, and the promotion of Vice 
Principal Otto Fuchs to the position of acting principal. 
At the Salem school, composed wholly of women pupils, instruction in the use of car- 
penters’ tools was introduced through the liberality of a lady of the city, and under the 
direction of a skilled conductor the senior class voluntarily prosecuted a course in this, 
covering an hour a week outside of the hours for regular school work. They thus learned 
to drive nails, to measure spaces, and to handle the saw and square and plane. The 
exercise was found by them to be as pleasing as it promised to be useful. It did not 
interfere with their usual studies and it is thought will prove of practical advantage to 
the pupils hereafter. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Boston Normal School, with 3 regular instructors, including the principal, and with 
several lecturers, continued to prepare pupils, mainly from the high schools, for teaching 
in the city schools. Up to February, 1882, the average belonging was 92; average at- 
tendance, 90. Up to June the average whole number was 89; average attendance, 87. 
Graduates for the year, 58. The regular course is given by the principal as 1 year, but 
in a classified official table for June, 1882, the 87 above given are divided into 58 of a 
first year class and 29 of a second year class. 
Cambridge City Training School in 1882 lost the principal who for some years had been 
in charge, and no successor was elected, though an order was passed ‘‘ thata training class 
should be established,’’ the members of which should act as assistant teachers and as 
substitutes, whenever necessary, in the primary and grammar schools. 
Fall River City Training School, begun in 1881, continued to give to approved graduates 
of the high school training in actual school instruction, under the guidance of regular 
teachers. The first year there were 18 pupil teachers; the second year, 25. The results 
of the 2 years’ trial of this plan, while encouraging, were not quite satisfactory. Besides 
this training of young candidates the regular teachers were called together several times 
in the year for discussion of educational methods and principles. 
Gloucester Training School, which was organized in 1879, was, for some unexplained 
reason, discontinued in 1882, though the city superintendent in his report for 1881 ex- 
pressed the belief that it could not be suspended even for a year without serious loss. 
Lawrence City Training School, the superintendent says, has fully realized in the school 
session of 1881—’82 the expectations expressed respecting it when it wasestablished. In 
December, 1881, the course had been completed by 7 pupils, who were all doing well in . 
the service of the city in other schools. 
Harvard and Wellesley Colleges continued their training of teachers, the former largely 
in natural sciences in the Lawrence Scientific School, not only in term time but also in the 
summer vacation; the latter, in optional collegiate studies, meant to cover usually 2 
years of work, with special instruction in microscopy. Students in this department 
numbered 80 in 1881-’82. 
Other normal training was given, according to returns, in Cushing Academy, Ashburn- 
- ham, where were 30 normal pupils in a 4-year course, under 6 instructors, with 140 other 
pupils; in the Kindergarten normal class of Miss Garland and Miss Weston, Boston, 
with 7 instructors and 15 pupils; and in the Training School for Kindergartners, Spring- 
field, under Miss Angeline Brooks, which had 11 pupils, under 4 instructors. - 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The secretary of the State board of education, with its 3 agents and selected instruc- 
tors and lecturers, in 1882 held 22 institutes for the improvement of the teachers of the 
State, especially in the small towns. The town committees usually codperated, closing   
1 Besides this training for such as desire to teach in the city schools of Boston, teachers others may attend the free lectures of the ‘Teachers’ School of Science and of the Lowell Institute, both annual courses in Boston provided by the liberality of private citizens, Many teachers aré said to have availed themselves of the advantages of the former. A course of lectures on psychology was also given to the teachers by Supervisor Parker; another, on drawing, by Mr. Hitchings; and 2 third, of practical lessons on méthods of teaching music in the schools, by Mr. Holt, one of the 
ee instructors in that subject, In several other cities similer special instruetion appears to have ven,

their schools that the teachers might attend the meetings and in many cases coming 
with them to render any necessary aid. The aggregate attendance was 1,941, an average 
of more than 88 per cent. of those registered at each place being present daily. Methods 
of teaching and of control formed the subjects for thedaily exercises. The evening lect- 
ures were directed rather to awakening the people to a livelier interest in their schools 
and to codperation with the teachers in efforts for improvement. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The excellent Journal of Education, Boston, weekly, was in its fifteerith and sixteenth 
volumes in 1882, erch volume of over 400 pages. The first half of each issue is largely 
devoted to educational ideas and methods; the second, to educational news. 
Other publications from the same office in the year were: Education, a bimonthly oc- 
tavo, for the discussion of the science, art, and literature of education, in its third vol- 
ume; The Public School, a monthly quarto, for the presentation of principles and methods 
of teaching, in its first volume; the Primary Teacher, a monthly octavo, devoted to pri- 
mary instruction, which closed its fifth volume June, 1882; and Good Times, for day 
school, Sunday school, and anniversary exhibitions, which entered on its sixth volume 
September, 1882. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
By law, any town in this State may establish a high school for instruction in higher 
English studies, civil government, and the Latin language. Towns with 500 families or 
householders must have such schools for the benefit of all the inhabitants, with at least 
10 months of annual term, exclusive of vacations. Towns of 4,000 inhabitants must also 
include in the high school course instruction in French and Greek for such as desire it, 
with natural, intellectual, and moral science, rhetoric, logic, and politicaleconomy. The 
towns required to maintain the lower of these grades were 49 in 1881-82; those required 
to maintain the higher were 84. Of towns not required to maintain such schools, 69 had 
them and 10 of the larger towns and cities had 2 or more. Boston, including its city 
normal school, had 11, the courses in 2 of them covering 6 years; those of 2 others, 4 years. 
The whole number of schools for the year was 221, with 605 teachers and 19,256 pupils, 
an increase of 6 in schools, of 10 in teachers, and of 356 in pupils. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The number of academies reported to the State authorities for the year is '70, an in- 
crease of 2; the number of pupils in them, 9,151, an increase of 1,082. The estimated 
tuition fees received amounted to $451,846, an increase of $18,005. 
For statistics of secondary schools, outside of the State system, reported to this Bureau, 
see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for a summary of these statistics, see corre- 
sponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The institutions of this class in 1882 were, as last reported, 7: Amherst College, Am- 
herst (Congregational); Boston College, Boston (Roman Catholic); Boston University, 
Boston (Methodist Episcopal); Harvard University, Cambridge (non-sectarian); Tufts 
College, College Hill (Universalist); Williams College, Williamstown (Congregational), 
and College of the Holy Cross, Worcester (Roman Catholic). The Massachusetts Agri- 
cultural College, which might also be included, will appear under Scientific Instruction, 
page 118. All had classical collegiate courses of 4 years, and nearly, all scientific courses 
of the same length. 
Harvard College has for some years been raising its standards of study and admission. 
An important change, introduced after full discussion, allows candidates for admission to 
join the sophomore class, if, after passing a creditable examination for admission, they 
also pass upon three-fifths of the freshman work and pledge themselves to make up the 
remaining two-fifths during the 3 remaining years. 
The college faculty and the academic council have abolished a distinction between 
undergraduate and graduate studies which had existed since 1877. The courses in any 
general subject, such as Greek or physics, are now arranged in one series and form one 
course. Special students have at length been admitted to all the privileges of under- 
graduates, except beneficiary scholarships and degrees. They may, therefore, now study 
anything taught in the university, be ranked with other students in the published rank 
lists, and be allowed also to compete for honors. A debated question as to the time and 
grounds for conferring the degree of M. A. approached a settlement, but did not quite   
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  MASSACHUSETTS. DLT. 
reach it. The effort is to make this degree an evidence of high attainments, instead of 
a mere honorarium coming almost of course two or three years after the degree of B. A. 
While ultimate success in this effortis assured, the way to reach all cases uniformly was 
not yet entirely clear. 
The measures taken in 1880-’81 for preventing the continuance of an annual deficit 
were so well devised that in August, 1982, there was a balance of receipts over expendi- 
tures of $91,937, exclusive of gifts for the capital account. 
The number of students in the 4 regular collegiate classes in 1881-—’82,was 824, besides 
37 unmatriculated; the number in the whole university, 1,397; professors, lecturers, and 
other instructors, 161. Students in summer courses (chemistry and botany), 27. 
Boston University, while maintaining its high regular collegiate course, offers to admit 
to a 4-year course for the degree of PH. B. persons s unable to take the full course in arts, 
but desiring to fit themselves for professional study or other liberal pursuits and show- 
ing their capacity for this by passing an examination on three-fourths of the requisites 
for admission to the freshman class. It also announces that, to accommodate mature 
students who desire to pursue the studies for the degree of A. B. with special thorough- 
ness, in a different order or with greater leisure for reading or laboratory work, any 
such student passing the examinations for admission to the freshman class may matricu- 
late as a candidate for the A. B. degree, with permission to take the studies required for 
this degree in whatever order he prefers, subject to the approval of the faculty. The 
instructors in the university for the year 1881-’82 numbered 94; students in its 3 col- 
leges, of liberal arts, of music, and of agriculture, 146; in its 4 schools of theology, law, 
medicine, and all sciences, 429; in both colleges and schools, deducting 30 counted twice, 
545. Of these, 117 were young women and 428 young men. 
Amherst College introduced for trial a new system of college government, under which 
no student was required to attend any recitation; if present and showing due proficiency, 
the student is allowed to proceed with his class to graduation; if absent or reciting un- 
satisfactorily, he must pass an examination at the end of the term. The plan is said 
to have worked well and to have been much more satisfactory than the old methods of 
constraint. 
Tufts College continued to confer special honors for advanced work in several lines of 
study and gave the degree of A. M. only to such graduates as should prove their pro- 
ficiency in graduate studies covering not less than 2 departments and a year of study. 
Instruction in electrical engineering was to be added, but,the addition was not effected 
in 1882. Students, not including theological, 71, of ‘whom 8 were candidates for the M. 
A. degree, 6 for that of c. E., and 1 special. 
Williams College, under its new president, declares its readiness to receive on the cer- 
tificate of instructors students presenting evidence that they have completed a course 
of study fully equivalent to that required for admission to the college. More attention 
is to,be given to the history, structure, and philological relations of the English language; 
the study of astronomy is to be aided by a new transit instrument, a refracting telescope, 
and a meridian circle, with the prospect of an observatory next year; the natural science 
collections are to occupy new buildings; and anew gymnasium and new dormitory build- 
ing were to be added. Professors and other instructors in 1881-’82, 15; students, 253, 
of whom 18 were in partial courses. 
Boston College and the College of the Holy Cross retained the same rudimentary, prepar- 
atory, and collegiate arrangements noticed in the former in 1879; in the latter, in 1876. 
The former had 1 graduate and 110 collegiate students; Holy Cross had 89 collegiate 
students. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
In Table VIII of the appendix may be found the statistics of 11 schools of this class, 
the same number that appeared in the table in 1881; the Swain Free School, New Bed- 
ford, having come into existence in 1882, is added, while the Oread Institute, suspended 
in 1881; is dropped. Of the 11, Smith and Wellesley Colleges (twinsisters of 1875) have 
regular charters from the State and are authorized to confer collegiate degrees; Lasell 
and Mount Holyoke Seminaries (organized respectively in 1851 and 1837) approximate 
closely to like collegiate rank, and to their thorough teaching of high grade studies add 
exercises in practical industries, Lasell having optional courses in book-keeping, cookery, 
dressmaking, and millinery, and Mount Holyoke engaging its young ladies for about an 
hour 4 day in the domestic work of the family. The remaining 7 (except Notre Dame 
Academy, Boston, incompletely reported) show fair provision for effective teaching, 
mostly in 4-year courses, which include Latin, German, French, and tn several cases 
Greek, with music, drawing, painting, and generally gymnastic exercises. The new 
Swain School is meant to supplement high school or academic training, with 2-year courses 
in normal, miscellaneous, art, and special studies, all free to resident young women of 
New Bedford and adjoining towns.

  118 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Instruction was given in the Harvard annex by 5 professors, 7 assistant professors, and 
11 others. The whole number of students aided was about 50, of whom 31 were from 
Massachusetts and 1 from Athens, Greece. In the 3 years of the annex instruction no 
case had arisen that called for discipline or even for remonstrance.—(Journal of Educa- 
tion, November 16, 1882.) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The State College of Agriculiure, Amherst, and the Bussey Institution of Harvard Uni- 
versity, Cambridge, continued in 1882 their instruction in agriculture and botanical, 
chemical, entomological, and veterinary science. _The first had a course of 4 years; the 
second, a course of 1 year for students with a thorough preparation and 2 years for 
others. Students at Amherst, 96 in 1881-82, under 11 instructors; at the Bussey Insti- 
tution, 7, under 7 instructors. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, retained its courses in engineer- 
ing, geology and mining, architecture, chemistry, metallurgy, natural history, physics, 
and combinations of these, each course covering 3 years beyond a first year course that 
prepares for all. To these courses it added in the fall of 1882 another in electrical engi- 
neering, to meet the fast increasing need for such instruction. A school of mechanic 
arts exists also for those who wish to enter on industrial pursuits, its course covering a 
year in carpentry, wood turning, pattern making, and foundry work, with another year 
in iron forging, vise work, and machine tool work. Then, too, under the auspices of the 
Lowell Institute, there are given, usually in the evening, at the Institute of Technology, 
annual courses of free instruction in science, varied from year to year, which are open 
to both sexes. The Lowell School of Design in the Institute prepares students for in- 
dustrial drawing and pattern work. Students in all courses, except the Lowell lect- 
ures, 516, under 43 instructors. There were 14 graduate students, 219 in regular 4-year 
courses, 57 in the school of mechanic arts, and 91 in that of practical design, the others 
being special students. 
The Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University maintained its courses, each of 
4 years, (1) in engineering, (2) in chemistry, (3) in natural history, and (4) in mathematics, 
physics, and astronomy, with 31 students, under 27 professors, instructors, and assistants, 
18 of the students being in special studies. 
The Woreester Free Institute of Industrial Science, Worcester, combining academic eult- 
ure with the practical applications of science, follows in general the teaching couxses of 
the polytechnic schools of Europe and in mechanical engineering gives special attention 
to actual work. The machine shop, which is furnished with all facilities for such work 
in wood and metal, from the first elements up to the actual building of machines, aids 
the school in preparing mechanics, mechanical and civil engineers, and designers for the 
duties of their respective trades or professions. The course for mechanical engineers 
occupies 3} years, that for all others 3 years, of 42 weeks each year. Students in 1882, 
132, under 8 professors and 3 other instructors. 
For more miscellaneous scientific training there was, as in previous years, the Boston 
University School of All Sciences, a department for elective graduate study only, in which 
were offered courses in philology, philosophy, languages, mathematics, and natural sci- 
ences, with others in law, literature, &c. Students in these, 53. 
Besides the courses of the schools above mentioned, there are opportunities for scien- 
tific culture in the monthly meetings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
and of the Society of Arts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Boston; 
in the weekly meetings and laboratory instruction of the Boston Society of Natural His- 
tory; inthe Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology and the Museum 
of Comparative Zodlogy, both at Cambridge; and also in the museum and summer school 
of biology connected with the Peabody Academy of Science, Salem. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology was taught in 1881-82 in at least 6 schools, with courses of 3 years, meant to 
follow a collegiate course, without evidence of which there was an examination for ad- 
mission. Theseschools were the Theological Seminary at Andover (Congregational), Har- 
vard Divinity School, Cambridge (non-sectarian), Episcopal Theoiogical School, Cam- 
bridge (Protestant Episcopal), Boston University School of Theology, Boston (Methodist 
Episcopal), Tufts College Divinity School, College Hill (Universalist), and Newton The- 
ological Institute, Newton Centre (Baptist). In all these there were, under 53 teachers, 
294 students, 207 of them in regular 3-year courses, 30in partial courses, and 48 resident 
graduates. Of the 207, there were 171 college graduates. In the Roman Catholic dio- 
cese of Springfield there were also 50 ecclesiastical students; in the New Church Theologi-+ 
cal School. Boston, the number is not reported.

Law was taught in 3-year courses, for which a preliminary collegiate training was de- 
sired, in the law school of Boston University, under 15 teachers, and in that of Harvard 
University, under 5. To both schools graduates of colleges are admitted without exam- 
ination; all others must prove their qualifications for pursuing the studies of the course, 
or for whatever advanced standing they may aim at, unless they desire to enter as spe- 
cial students of certain studies only, without reference toa degree. At Boston there are 
advanced courses of 2 years for the degree of LL.M. and of 4 years for that of D. C. L., the 
candidates for which degrees must be both bachelors of arts and bachelors of laws. In 
these courses were 3 students in 1881-’82, besides 6 other graduate students; 138 inthe 
3-year course, and 27 special students. Harvard offers the degree of LL. B. cum laude 
to law students thatafter 2 full years in the school as candidates forthe degree pass ex- 
aminations on the whole honor course of 3 years; but no such honor students appear 
there in 1881-’82, though there were 123 regular students in the 3-year course, besides 
33 special students. 
Medicine, according to the ‘‘regular”’ school, was taught at the Harvard University 
medical department, organized in 1782, and at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
organized in 1880, both in Boston. Both had graded courses extending over 3 years, the 
full 8 years being required at the Harvard School and a fourth year recommended, while 
the other required but 2 years of attendance and recommended a third year. The Har- 
vard schoal also adopted a much higher standard for adniission to its course, and its cat- 
alogue for 1881~’82 shows, besides 224 in the required 3-year course, 10 in the unre- 
quired fourth year. The school employed 49 professors and instructors. The College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, which admits women as well as men, had 21 instructers and 
professors, 24 matriculates, and 4 graduates in its second year. 
A third school, the Boston University School of Medicine, was of the homeopathic 
class, but of a standard for admission and graduation similar to that of Harvard, its an- _ 
nual course being of about 30 weeks and its examination for admission of all but col- 
lege graduates high. The degree of M. D. is given for the regular 3-year course and 
for the 4-year course, the degree of surgical bachelor or medical bachelor being allowed 
for 3 years’ work in the latter. Students in the 3-year course in 1881-’82, 90; in the 4- 
year-course, 19, with 1 graduate student, all under 18 professors and instructors. 
Dentistry is taught in two institutions, the Harvard University Dental School and the 
Boston Dental College, both in Boston. Each school has a 2-year course. 
Pharmacy, in a 2-year course, was pursued at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, 
Boston, the term each year occupying about 6 months. Students in1881~-’82, 102, under 
4 professors. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOME STUDY. 
The Society for the Encouragement of Home Study, organized in 1873, reports for the 
year 1881~’82 a membership of 988 students, of whom 732 studied at least 4 months 
and thus became entitled to some rank under the system, a larger membership than 
that of any previous year. There were 555 new students. Of the 433 old students, 
2 entered for their eighth term, 7 for a seventh, 10 for a sixth, 48 for a fifth, 60 fora 
fourth, 97 for a third, and 209 for a second. The usual proportions of the departments 
were maintained, history numbering 381, English literature 367, art 107, the sciences 
114, German 48, and French 34. One improvement noted during the year is that fewer 
studies were taken at once, the result being a higher rank in scholarship. The number 
of teaehers among the students (154, or nearly 16 per cent.) is larger than ever before. 
The geographical distribution was wider, and more were from the Southern and South- 
western States. Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee gave nearly twice as many as last 
year, and Louisiana, Texas, the Carolinas, Alabama, and Mississippi, 35 per cent. more. 
During the year, 1,232 books were circulated by the lending library, which numbered 
1,308 volumes. Since 1874 only 10 books have been lost, 6 in the mail and 4 by the 
carelessness of borrowers. 
TRAINING IN MUSIC, ORATORY, AND LANGUAGES. 
Advanced instruction in music was given in the New England Conservatory of Music, 
Boston, under Professor E. Tourjée; in the Boston Conservatory of Music, under Julius 
Eichberg; in the Mendelssohn Musical Academy; and in the musical courses of Boston 
University and Wellesley and other colleges. 
The New England Conservatory of Musie is planned upon a broad basis, embracing 16 
separate schools and comprising instruction on the piano, organ, violin, and on all or- 
chestral and band instruments, in the art of conducting, in harmony, composition, 
theory and orchestration, church music, oratorio, chorus singing, cultivation of the voice, 
and tuning of pianos and organs. Physical culture and the training of music teachers 
for the public schools are also included. A still more advanced course in music, leading
-P-A-G-E-414
120 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
to the highest musical degrees, is offered in connection with Boston University; also, a 
collegiate course in the latter institution, with which this is intimately connected. The 
Conservatory also makes provision for the study of the common and higher branches in 
connection with the musical training, and offers special facilities in the study of French, 
German, and Italian, which are taught by professors of. the Berlitz School of Languages 
on the plan originated by Professor Gottlieb Heness and carried forward by Professor 8. 
M. Stern and Dr. L. Sauveur. + 
* TRAINING IN THE ARTS AND TRADES. 
Besides the industrial training given in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
Boston, and the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science, Worcester, already 
noted, instruction in various arts and trades is offered by a number of special schools, 
most of them in Boston. 
The Liversidge Institution of Industry, Boston, established in 1881 in accordance with a 
bequest of Thomas Liversidge, is for the benefit of orphan and destitute boys of England 
and New England. The intention is to give them practical instruction in trades and 
industries; also, a good primary and grammar school education, 6 hours a day being de- 
voted to school studies. 
. The Boston Cooking School, an enterprise of the Woman’s Educational Association, gave 
instruction during the latter part of 1882 to over 500 pupils in its ordinary classes and 
to even a larger number in its free classes among the poor. During the four years of its 
existence the school has trained 18 women as teachers, all of whom found excellent 
positions. 
TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR NURSES. 
Three training schools for nurses reported, all connected with hospitals in Boston: the 
Boston Training School for Nurses, attached to the Massachusetts Genéral Hospital; the 
Boston City Hospital Training School for Nurses, opened in 1878 ; and the Training School 
for Nurses of the New England Hospital for Womenand Children, incorporated in 1863 but 
first opened in 1872. The last reports 16 pupils and 7 graduates'during the year, and 
150 students since 1872, of whom about one-third have graduated. ‘ 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
Provision is made by the State for the education of its deaf and dumb in the American 
Asylum, Hartford, Conn., the Clarke Institution, Northampton, Mass., and the Horace 
Mann School, Boston. 
The Clarke Institution is supported partly from funds left by its founder, the late John 
Clarke, and partly from appropriations made by the State. Neither the manual alphabet 
nor the sign languageis usedhere. Articulation, lip reading, writing, and reading are the 
only means used in communicating instruction, The pupils understand what is said by 
reading the lips of their teachers and others, and learn to speak, not with great distinctness 
or in tones altogether natural, but still so that they can be understood very easily by their 
teachers and generally by others. There were 91 pupils under instruction here during the 
year, of whom 74 were from Massachusetts, 
The Horace Mann School, established by the Boston school committee, in‘connection 
with the State board of education, as a day school for deaf children, admits free of tuition 
any deaf child over 5 years of age residing in Boston not physically or mentally disquali- 
fied. Non-residents are charged the average cost of tuition for each pupil, unless received _ 
as State beneficiaries. The school aims to teach all its pupils to speak and to read the 
speech of others from their lips, and gives an elementary English education. Efforts to 
secure industrial training for the pupils have been tosome extent successful. A donation 
of $250 from Prof. Bell, for the benefit of needy pupils, was partly used in payment of 
the tuition of 3 boys at the School of Mechanic Arts in the Institute of Technology, while 
the parents of 4 other boys paid the whole cost of tuition for them. All took great in- 
terest in the work, and their success warranted a return for a second year’s training. 
Several girls who had shown much aptitude with the needle in the regular sewing in- 
struction of the school were given special instruction in the art of needlework as an 
added preparation for self support. Some of these girls were aided from the donation of 
Prof. Bell. At the close of the school year, June, 1882, there were 84 pupils attending, 
53 of them from Boston, 29 from towns in the vicinity, and 2 from other States. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Perkins Institute and Massachusetts School for the Blind, Boston, admits blind 
children 9 to 19 years of age and gives free tuition on the governor’s warrant to resi- 
dents of the State whose friends are unable to pay. There were 165 pupils under 
instruction at the date of the report in 1882, of whom 145 were in the school proper and 
20 in the workshop for adults. .The usual course of study, with music, physical train-
-P-A-G-E-415
  
MASSACHUSETTS. 121 
ing, and handicrafts, was pursued during the year. In the literary department all sug- 
'gestions of improvement in processesof mental development are carefully considered and 
several changes have been adopted. The aim is to give instruction in the most simple 
and natural - way, and the objective method is used whenever possible. The music 
department enrolled 73, of whom 68 were learning the piano; 10, the organ; 21, reed and 
ibrass instruments; 47, class singing ; and 21, harmony, 17 receiving private vocal train- 
ing. There were 4 classes for instruction in the art of teaching music, with an average 
membership in each of 5. The tuning department continued to receive special atten- 
ition, with the usual encouraging results; several improvements were made in the appli- 
ances and new facilities added for rendering the instruction efficient. The results of 
industrial training in the workshops for the boys and the workrooms for the girls were 
satisfactory, as usual. Special attention has also been given to physical training in 6 
regular gymnastic classes, under experienced and prudent teachers, with results quite 
favorable to health and appearance. The work in the printing department of the insti- 
tution has been carried on with unusual vigor, and_a number of valuable books have 
been issued. A printing fund of $100,000 was completed during the year. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
Feeble-minded and idiotic youth receive training and instruction at the State school 
for them in South Boston, at a private institution in Barre, and at another in Fayville. 
The Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth, South Boston, gives free 
instruction to residents of the State whose friends are notable to pay for their care, none, 
however, being received who are epileptic, insane, or incurably paralytic. The studies 
range from the simplest Kindergarten pastimes to the exercises of an easy primary or 
lower grammar class. There were 132 pupils at the date of the report for 1882, of whom 
109 were entirely supported by the State and 10 partially. 
The Private Institution for the Education of Feeble-Minded Youth, Barre, established in 
1848, receives a limited number of pupils, from 6 years upward. They are instructed 
in the elementary branches, according to their capacity ; also, in work. Special attention 
is given to health, exercise in the open air, and gymnastics. Military drill is also 
included. 
Hillside School, Fayville, is a private home school designed for the instruction and train- 
ing of children who cannot be properly taught in ordinary schools, whether they be 
blind, deaf and dumb, or feeble in mind or body. The English branches, music, draw- 
ing, painting, fret sawing, and physical exercises are taught. The.number of pupils is 
limited to 12.— (Circular.) 
CHARITABLE AND REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS. 
The State board of education reports 14 charitable and reformatory institutions, with 
over 1,000 different pupils under instruction during the year and 592 in average attend- 
ance, under 29 teachers. 
Of these, the State Primary School, at Monson, an outgrowth of the almshouse, is pecul- 
jarly hopeful in its field of labor and successful in its results. Taking the chil- 
dren at an impressible age (the average being about 9 years) from the State almshouse, 
the streets, and the neglected abodes of poverty stricken or vicious parents, it puts them 
into a pleasant home, where they enjoy what is necessary to make childhood happy 
and where they are nurtured and trained till they can be placed in good families. Many 
of them are weak and diseased, either through heredity or neglect and. starvation, 
Here they are supplied with an abundance of simple nourishing food and suitable cloth- 
ing, cleanly habits and proper exercise and amusement in the open air being insisted 
on. Visible restraints are reduced toa minimum. Very few punishments are found 
necessary, and these are of the mildest character. There were 756 children in the school 
during the year, the average number being 448, of whom 183 were placed in families. 
The State Reform School, for boys, Westboro’, had 290 under training during the year, 
with an average number of 113, and placed out in homes 146. Of 108 committed during 
the year, 80 were 14 years old or more. The maximum limit of age for admission is 17 
years, but some boys even older secure admission by the misrepresentations of friends 
who wish to spare them a greater disgrace. Thus many boys have found their way here 
who are too old and too hardened in crime to be managed by the methods of a reform 
school and who really belong in an intermediate institution between such a school and 
aprison. The trustees earnestly advise that the law be changed, fixing the limit of age 
at 14; they say that so long as the present condition is permitted the labors of the institu- 
tion in behalf of the younger boys will be in a measure defeated by the influence of the 
older ones. Besides the common school branches, farm work and the caning of chairs 
are taught. 
The State Industrial School for Girls, Lancaster, had nearly twice as many under its 
care in 1882 as in the previous year. This does not necessarily show an increase in crime,
-P-A-G-E-416
  122 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
but may indicate a fuller appreciation of the benefits of the school on the part of the courts 
and the guardians of girls committed. Of 229 on the list during 2 years, 26 were com- 
mitted for stubbornness, 40 for larceny, 91 for immoral conduct, and 72 because in dan- 
ger of falling into bad ways. During this period, 4 died after being placed out, 50 were 
discharged, 63 remained in the school (10 of whom were returned for misconduct), and 
119 were placed out; on only 23 had the care apparently been wasted. Besides the com- 
mon English branches the girls are taught plain sewing, cutting and making of their 
clothing, knitting, and housework, including washing and ironing. They are also em- 
ployed on the farm and garden in work suited to their strength. 
‘There are various private and church institutions for the care of neglected and orphan 
children. In the latter children are received at a very early age and retained until 14, 
15, and 16, being taught the common branches of education, besides housework and 
various handicraits. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MASSACHUSETTS STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCTATION. 
The thirty-eighth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held in Bos- 
ton, December 28-30, 1882, President Larkin Dunton, of Boston, in the chair. Among 
the subjects before the general meeting were ‘‘Sierra’s enchanted valley, or the Yosem- 
ite and the big trees of California,’’ illustrated by stereopticon views; ‘* Bands of mercy: 
their purpose and formation;’’? ‘‘ What place, if any, is religion entitled to in our system 
of public education?”’ ‘Illustrative drawing;’’ ‘The high school in our system of edu- 
cation;’’ ‘The duties of school committees,” and ‘‘ Whatis education?’’? General Fran- 
cis A. Walker, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, read a paper on 
“Tndustrial education,’’ and Prof. John M. Ordway, of the same institution, one on 
sl6jd schools, the latter being an account of industrial schools in Sweden and Norway. 
Discussion followed the reading of all the above papers, that of the last two named be- 
ing of special interest and participated in by a number of members. 
Tn the high school section the topics considered were ‘‘ How to study English litera- 
ture,’ ‘The realia of Greek literature,’’? and ‘‘The rudiments of German,”’ the method 
of instruction advocated by the last paper being illustrated by an exercise with a class 
of 9 boys from the English High School, Boston. 
The subjects considered by the grammar school section were ‘‘Can history be taught as 
a natural science?’’ and “‘Geography and incidental lessons,’’ a thorough discussion fol- 
lowing both papers. 
Before the primary school section were read papers on “Lessons on objects,” ‘‘The 
four-process method of teaching numbers,” and “The Kindergarten in its relation to the 
primary school,’’ the last two topics being discussed by a number of members. 
ASSOCIATION OF CLASSICAL AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS, 
The fifteenth annual meeting of the classical and high school teachers was. held in Bos- 
ton, April 7 and 8, 1882. The first paper read was on ‘‘Some needed reforms in the use 
of botanical terms as applied to schools;’’ the second gave ‘‘Some hints on science teach- 
ing.” ‘‘ English classics for high schools’? was the theme of a spicy paper which advo- 
cated the more general and thorough study of the English language in the schools. ‘‘Out- 
of-school study ’’ gave statistics collected in Fitchburg as tothe number of hours spent by 
the pupils in study at home, the conclusion being that the amount of such study was not 
generally injurious to health. Other papers were on ‘‘The use of photographs in classi- 
cal instruction,”’ on ‘‘ Voluntary work in schools,”’ ‘‘ Educational history,’’ ‘‘The special 
aim of the teacher of language,’’ ‘‘A plan for a town university,’’ ‘‘The senses and ge- 
ometry,”’ ‘‘Some common errors and omissions of text books in physical science,’’ ‘“Bot- 
any as a mental discipline,’’ ‘‘Chemistry in high schools,”’ ‘‘Hints on high school dis- 
cipline,’’ and ‘‘An ideal linguistic requirement for admission to college,’’ the latter being 
a protest against the common practice of devoting the principal work of linguistic prep- 
aration for college to the study of Latin and Greek. 
SCHOOL COMMITTEE ASSOCIATIONS. 
There were during 1831—’82 nine associations of local school committees, meeting twice 
a year to discuss educational matters, lay out courses of study for the adjoining towns, 
and adopt improved methods. _'These discussions have been of great benefit to the schools 
as well as to the committee. In each association the abolition of the district system was 
favored, some urging the formation of the small towns into groups, to be under super- 
intendents to oversee the schools, each single town being too small to maintain a supers 
intendent of its own.

OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROFESSOR THEOPHILUS PARSONS. 
Theophilus Parsons, professor of law in Harvard University from 1847 to 1870 and 
widely known as a writer of legal treatises, died at Cambridge, January 26, 1882, aged 
85. Hewas born in Newburyport, Mass., in 1797. In 1800 his father moved to Boston, 
where the son was fitted for Harvard, graduating from that college in 1815. In 1849 
he received from that college the degree of LL.D. Although engaged in the pursuit of 
Jaw his exceptional talents as a writer found exercise in editorial work in connection 
with the United States Literary Gazette and other periodicals. He was a successful 
lawyer, but did not like practice, and was not sorry to retire from it when appointed 
professor in the Harvard Law School. He devoted himself to the preparation of legal 
treatises. In this work he was very successful, many of his books being considered the 
standard authorities on their subjects now. He continued in this work after his retire- 
ment from the law professorship, also writing works for the New Church (Swedenbor- 
gian), of which he was a devout and active member. His was a serene and happy old 
age. He was well read in the classics, ancient and modern, was proficient in natural 
philosophy and chemistry, and was thoroughly informed on all the important questions 
of his day, in which he took a lively interest.— (Boston Advertiser. ) 
HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the poet, scholar, and teacher, died at his home in 
Cambridge, Mass., March 24, 1882, after an illness of less than a week. 
«Mr. Longfellow was born in Portland, Me., February 27, 1807, of New England stock, 
being descended from John Alden, of Plymouth colonial fame. His father, Hon. Stephen 
Longfellow, was a man of prominence in Maine, a leader of the bar, and representative 
in Congress. The son’s early education was gained at the Portland Academy, where he 
was fitted for Bowdoin College, which he entered at 14. Even before this time he had 
written verses which always found ready admission into the Portland newspapers, and 
before graduation his reputation as a poet extended beyond the bounds of both college 
and State. He graduated second in rank in his class, and six months after was offered 
a professorship of modern languages and literature at Bowdoin, an office created for him. 
Such a professorship was at that time an exceptional thing among American colleges, the 
literature of Greece and’ Rome having hitherto been deemed sutiicient for the purposes 
of college instruction. The appointment was accepted, but only on the condition that 
time should be allowed for study abroad before entering on it. He accordingly spent 
three years and a half on the Continent studying French, German, Italian, and Span- 
ish. \» In 1829, at the age of 22, he entered on the professorship, in which he remained 
five years. During this time he wrote for the North American Review and translated 
the Goplas de Manrique, a work which placed him in the front rank of living poets. 
Outre-Mer: a Pilgrimage Beyond the Sea came out in 1835. In 1835 he was appointed 
to the professorship of modern languages and belles lettres in Harvard College, but before 
‘entering on it he again visited Europe, beginning his official duties at Cambridge in 1836 
and continuing them till 1854. Meantime his career as an author went steadily on, each 
year adding to his fame both as a poet and prose writer. From his first connection with 
Harvard Mr. Longfellow lived in Cambridge, occupying, fixst as tenant and afterwards 
as owner, the mansion famous as being the headquarters of Washington during the siege 
of Boston. His professional services at Cambridge contributed in no small degree to his 
own fame and to that of the university, where he was always a favorite professor. The 
great charm of his presence and manner heightened the pleasure derived from his instruc- 
tion, which, in the form of lectures, was chiefly in Italian and Spanish literature, espe- 
cially the writings of Dante and Cervantes. His translation of Dante was originally a 
part of this class instruction. 
Mr. Longfellow received the degree of M. A. from Bowdoin, LL. D. from Harvard, Cam- 
bridge (England), and Bowdoin, and D. c. L. from Oxford. He wasamember of various 
learned societies in this country, also of one in Brazil, one in Spain, and one in Russia. 
GEORGE C. MERRILL, 
Prof. George C. Merrill died of consumption at Andover, April 19, 1882, after an ill- 
ness of 18 months. He was born in Montague, in 1845, fitted for college at Andover, 
and graduated from Amherst College in 1865. After that he was a teacher of mathe- 
matics for tour years in Phillips Andover Academy, and from 1869 to 1875 professor of 
mathematics and natural sciences ingWashburn College, Kansas. In 1875 he went to 
Phillips Academy as Peabody instrucfor of the natural sciences, a position he filled ac- 
ceptably till his health gave way in the fallof 1880. A year in Colorado failed to check 
the progress of his disease and in January he returned to Andover. Mr. Merrill was a 
man of much learning, successful as a teacher, and beloved and trusted as a Christian.

124 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
KO KUN-HUA. 
Mr. Ko Kun-Hua, instructor in Chinese at Harvard College since 1879, died of pneu- 
monia, after a brief illness, on the 14th of February, 1882, leaving a large family of 
young children in a helpless condition. These were sent back to Shanghai by the uni- 
versity, and a private subscription was raised sufficient to secure them against want un- 
til the children should be grown up and educated. Mr. Ko Kun-Hua was a refined, 
scholarly, and conscientious man.— (President’s report. ) 
MRS. M. B. C. SLADE. 
The Journal of Education of April 20, 1882, records the death of Mrs. M. B. C. 
Slade, of Fall River, aged 56, formerly assistant editor of the Journal and for the last 
four or five years editor of Good Times, a monthly magazine devoted to day school 
and parish recreations, Sunday school exercises, and mission and temperance entertain- 
ments. 
Mrs. Slade was born in Fall River, where her home has always been, and prior to 
her marriage was a successful teacher. She has contributed to the literature of educa- 
tion in its varied forms for several years; was interested in the Little Corporal, pub- 
lished in Chicago ; edited the School Festival; compiled from her writings the Holiday 
Concert ; conducted a department in the School Day Magazine of_ Philadelphia ; wrote 
for the St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, and other periodicals for the young ; and published 
two books for young people, The Children’s Hour and Exhibition Days, which were both 
very successful, the former comprising dialogues, tableaux, &c., for primary schools, 
and the latter, exercises suited to pupils in the common, grammar, and high schools. She 
gave sympathy and help to all who came within her influence. 
WILLIAM B. ROGERS. 
Prof. William Barton Rogers, for many years president of the Massachusetts Insti- 
tute of Technology, died suddenly, May 30, while assisting at the graduating exercises of 
the class of 1882. The venerable ex-president—then in his seventy-seventh year—had 
been presented to the audience by his successor, Gen. Francis A. Walker, and welcomed. 
with enthusiastic cheers. He responded by referring to the history of the school and 
expressing his own unabated interest in its progress and that of science in general,“when 
he suddenly fell and in a few minutes ceased to breathe. ~ 
Professor Rogers, the second of four sons in a family noted for scientific acquirements, 
was born in Philadelphia in 1805 and was graduated at William and Mary College. In 
1827 he succeeded his father, Dr. P. K. Rogers, as professor of natural philosophy and 
chemistry in that institution and in 1835 accepted the chair of natural philosophy and 
geology in the University of Virginia, which he held 18 years. During this period 
he devoted himself ardently and successfully to geology and mineralogy. He was at the 
head of a geological organization which made a survey of the State of Virginia and pub- 
lished annual reports of great value on the work. He also published a treatise on ‘“The 
strength of material’ and one on ‘‘Elements of mechanical philosophy.’’ In°1853 he 
removed to Boston and at once identified himself with the educational interests of the 
city. He early conceived the plan for the organization of the Institute of Technology 
and was appointed its first president, which office he retained till 1881, although as early 
as 1868 illness obliged him to relinquish some of its active duties. ‘ 
Professor Rogers added to extraordinary scientific attainments a personality which by 
its integrity, earnestness, simplicity, and warmheartedness attracted and developed all 
that was best and noblest in others. As a zealous promoter of scientific education among 
the industrial classes he had no superior. His writings have enriched the pages of all the 
leading scientific periodicals in Europe and America. “He received the degree of LL.D. 
from Harvard in 1866.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The State school system is administered by a State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, elected by the people for 2 years; a State board of education, elected for 6 years, 
of which the superintendent is a member and secretary ex officio; and a board of regents 
of the University of Michigan, elected for 8 years. Local officers are district boards 
numbering 3 members in ungraded and boards of school trustees numbering 6 members
-P-A-G-E-420
126 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
in graded school districts, elected for 3 years; township boards of school inspectors, and 
Son school examiners for each county, elected by the chairmen of the township 
ards. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are sustained from the income of a State primary school fund, from a 
_ township tax of 1 mill on $1 (part of which is for the support of libraries), and from taxes 
voted by the districts, of such amount as is considered necessary by the district boards; 
provided that in districts having less than 30 scholars it must not exceed $50 a month 
(including amounts received from 1 mill tax and primary school fund) for the’ period 
during which school is taught in such district. Schools sustained by public funds must 
not be sectarian, and they must be taught at least 9 months in districts having 800 or 
more youth of school age, at least 5 months in districts having ftom 30 to 800, and three 
months in all other districts. They are free to all residents of the district 5 years of age 
and over, without distinction of race or color, and no separate schools for any race are 
allowed by the law. Teachers not graduates of the State Normal School must have cer- 
tificates of qualification from the county examiners or from the State board of education. 
The county certificates, valid only in the county where issued, are of 3 grades, good for 
1, 2, and 3 years. State certificates are valid throughout the State for 10 years. The 
State educational system includes graded, ungraded, and high schools, township and 
district school libraries, county teachers’ institutes, a State teachers’ association, nor- 
mal school, university and agricultural college, institutions for the deaf and dumb and 
the blind, two reform schools, and a Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The cause of education has shared in the general prosperity that marked Michigan 
affairs during the year 1882. With an increase during the year of 20,000 in youth of 
school age, there were 13,761 more enrolled in public schools, the percentage of enrol- 
ment on youth of school age remaining about the same. There was a larger number 
of public school districts and a larger number sustained public schools; 153 more public 
school-houses were built, increasing the estimated value of school property by nearly 
half a million of dollars and affording accommodations for over 27,000 more pupils, 
thus considerably more than keeping pace with the increase in school population. A 
corresponding increase is noted in the expenditure for public school purposes and in 
tHe principal of the available State school fund. While about the same number of 
teachers were employed as during the preceding year, that of'men was 137 less and that 
of women nearly as many more, the average monthly pay of men advancing $4.58 and 
that of women $1.66. This increase in pay, which was almost confined to the rural dis- 
tricts, is ascribed to the operation of the new school law. As the severity of the exami- 
nations was increased, the supply of competent teachers was found inadequate, and the 
pay of men in the ungraded school districts advanced $4.61 and that of women $4.83, 
although, as stated above, the increase for the State was $4.58 for men and $1.66 for women. 
But this advance in pay, the superintendent thinks, will prove temporary only, since, 
owing to the gréater inducements offered, unsuccessful applicants are endeavoring by hard 
study to fit themselves for the examinations and many old teachers who had ceased teach- 
ing on account of the poor pay are returning to the ranks; large numbers also are being 
prepared in normal schools, high schools, and colleges. It is noted that, while the num- 
per of graded school districts and the school population therein increased in greater pro- 
portion than the ungraded, the percentage of public school attendance in graded school 
districts was still smaller than in the ungraded. This state of affairs, however, was 
accounted for by an enrolment of over 20,000 in the private schools of the graded dis- 
tricts. The ruralschools, while not up to what they ought to be, were doing their work 
with a degree of efficiency not surpassed in any previous year, and the general aspect of 
theeducational field, despite some drawbacks, was such as to afford satisfaction and to 
give encouragement. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Five Kindergarten, 1 of them organized within the year, report for 1881-82. Three 
of these are at Detroit, 1 at East Saginaw, and 1 at Ionia. For statistics, see Table V 
of the appendix, and for a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Under a general law of 1875 these are boards of 6 trustees, elected for three years; but 
cities chartered before that time have different provisions. Detroit has a board of educa- 
tion of 12 and Grand Rapids one of 16 members. Superintendents are employed in all 
the larger and many of the smaller cities.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The Ann Arbor public schools report an advance during the year in the number en- 
rolled, but a decrease in average attendance in the primary and grammar grades, due to 
the prevalence of scarlet fever and measles. While work in these grades was conducted 
in much the same manner as usual, increased attention was given to handwriting, with 
good results. In nearly all the schools some time was given to committing and reciting 
choice selections of poetry. The superintendent thinks some progress was made in ban- 
ishing the dimenovel from the boys’ stock ofreading. In grammar grades such pupilg as 
maintained a standing of 90 per cent. in any study, as shown by the monthly examina- 
tion reports, were excused from final term examinations in that study, an innovation 
which lessened the strain of examinations on both teachers and pupils and seemed to 
work well. Inaclass of 56 promoted during the year from the grammar to the high school, 
11 maintained a standing of over 90 per cent. in all their work. ‘The number of pupils 
enrolled in the high school was larger than for any previous year in the history of the 
school, reaching 493, of whom 285 were non-residents. Good order was maintained in all 
the schools and with less corporal punishment than usual, only 19 cases being reported, 
’ against 39 the previous year and 50 the year before that. 
Grand Rapids, with only 663 more youth of school age, reports an attendance on pub- 
lie schools of 723 beyond that of the previous year, by far the largest annual advance 
in one year in the history of the schools. To meet it more school buildings were pro- 
yided and the corps of teachers was enlarged. The cost of schools increased $12,429. 
More attention was paid to the sanitary condition of school buildings. Drawing, music, 
and penmanship were taught by a special teacher for each, and with satisfactory re- 
sults. Good discipline was maintained in most cases without corporal punishment, 
which was seldom resorted to by the best teachers. The evening schools were con- 
ducted ona new plan, only foreigners unable to read English being admitted, as it was 
not thought profitable to maintain such schools for young people. Attendance during 
the term was regular and the interest was well sustained, about 120 being enrolled, 
nearly all adults. 
In Muskegon there was an increase in school population and school enrolment. 
There was also an advance in the average daily attendance and in punctuality. The 
schools BSSREE Re efficient, largely, it was believed, through the selection of good 
teachers. Corporal punishment was eschewed, many teachers not reporting a case dur- 
ing the year. 
No printed reports for 1881-82 have been received by this Office from the other cities 
embraced in the above table, but such statistics as they have furnished in special returns 
will be found in Table IT of the appendix. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. : 
STATE PROVISION FOR NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
The State Normal School, Ypsilanti, reports an increased attendance during the year, 
pupils in the normal department numbering 330, against 318 the previous year, while 
the practice school increased from 174 to 181. Eighty-five students graduated in 1882, 
nearly all of whom engaged in teaching. With the increase of its students and gradu- 
ates the influence of the school is becoming more widely felt. Additions were made dur- 
ing the year to the corps of teachers, the courses of study, and the facilitiesfor work. A 
new building for the training school, erected at a cost of $25,000, was ready for occupancy 
in September, 1882. The library was enlarged hy over a thousand well selected vol- 
umes, and considerable additions were made to the collections of scientific apparatus,

drawings, models, maps, globes, and charts. Students are offered a choice among 5 dis- 
tinct courses of study, viz: scientific, language, literary, art, and common school courses, 
_besides being allowed, in all courses except the elementary, an election of Latin, French, 
or German in place of certain specified subjects. The elementary course covers 2 years, 
while the other courses require 4 for completion. 
The course in the science and art of teaching, connected with the undergraduate de- 
partment of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, aims to fit university students for 
the higher positions in the public school service. It offers ample facilities for profes- 
sional study, and is designed to promote the study of educational science, to teach the 
history of education and of educational systems and doctrines, to secure to teaching the 
rights, prerogatives, and advantages of a profession, and to give a more perfect unity to 
the State educational system by bringing the secondary schools into closer relations with 
the university. Various courses are marked out to suit the wants of different students, 
each requiring a year for completion. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Adrian and Hillsdale Colleges furnish opportunities for preparation to those desiring 
to become teachers, in courses extending over two years; Battle Creek, in a 4-year course; 
Olivet, in courses of 2, 3, or 4 years. 
The Detroit Kindergarten Training School, having a 1-year course of study, reported 9 
students, under 2 instructors, and 4 graduates.— (Return. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The institutes of the year were unusually interesting; the instruction was in most 
cases practical, and the teachers manifested their zeal by regular attendance and by de- 
riving the utmost advantage from the sessions. The number held was 68, an increase of 
13 over that of 1881, while the aggregate attendance (5,566) was greater than the previous 
year by more than 1,000. Twenty-three of the teachers present had received State cer- 
tificates, 88 normal school diplomas, 406 county certificates of first grade, 520 of second, 
and 2,848 of third. There were also 106 who had special certificates; these, being in 
the nature of permits to teach particular schools, are granted to candidates whose schools 
are to begin before the public examinations. Notwithstanding the fact that many of 
the institutes were held in the new counties, where teachers are few, accommodations 
limited, and facilities for travel poor, the average attendance was equally well sustained. 
An important agency in securing a large attendanceat the institutes has been the county 
boards of examiners, who excited the interest of teachers and the community and con- 
tributed greatly to the success of the institutes. f 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Michigan School Moderator, a weekly journal ‘‘for the teacher, the school, and 
the family,” published at Grand Rapids, commenced its third volume September 3, 1882. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
A table in the State superintendent’s report gives statistics of 60 high school depart- 
ments of graded school districts, having a total enrolment of 6,856 pupils, under about 
170 teachers. It appears, too, that some of the higher branches were taught in other 
graded schools not comprised in the high school table. In a list of the graded schools 
of 255 cities, including the 60 high schools above referred to, 81 are reported as giving 
instruction in Latin, 50 in German, 25 in French, and 22 in Greek. 
The largest high school in the State, that at Ann Arbor, reports an enrolment for the 
year of nearly 500 pupils, more than half of them non-residents, and 63 graduates. It is 
asserted that no other publicschool in America prepares so many pupils annually for col- 
lege and university or has so many non-resident students. A new course of study has 
been added during the year, in which about a third of the work is music. Pupils may 
graduate from this on the same footing as from the other courses, it being considered that 
the mental discipline will be about equal to that in the other courses. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, a part of the public educational system and 
governed by a board of regents elected by popular vote, is enabled, through funds pro- 
vided by the United States and by the State, to offer its privileges without charge for tui-
-P-A-G-E-423
  MICHIGAN. 129 
tion to all persons of either sex who are qualified for admission. Students from abroad 
are received on the same terms as residents of the State, except that their matriculation 
fee is somewhat higher. The university is closely connected with the public schools, 
receiving pupils on diploma from such high schools as are approved by the faculty. It 
aims to complete public school work by furnishing ample facilities for liberal education 
in literature, science, and the arts and for thorough professional study of medicine, 
pharmacy, law, and dentistry. In the department of literature, science, and the arts, nu- 
merous elective courses are provided, leading to the degrees of bachelor of arts, science, and 
letters, with the corresponding masters’ degrees ; also, to the degree of doctor of philoso- 
phy and to those of civil, mechanical, and mining engineer. The work in this depart- 
ment was broadened by the establishment of a chair of didactics in 1879 and a school of 
political science in the autumn of 1881, . The latter was attended during its first year by 
an encouraging number of students, the classes being instructed in political and constitu- 
tional history and law, political economy, natural, civil, and political rights, the science 
of forestry, and sanitary science. The last two, it is claimed, have never before been 
taught in any American university. The course in forestry has deservedly attracted 
much attention. 
President Angell mentions various evidences of progress made during his two years of 
absence on a diplomatic mission to China, among them the erection of a new museum 
building and of an eye and ear infirmary and the enlargement of the chemical laboratory 
to nearly double its former capacity. 
The number of students for the two years was greater than ever hefore, that for 1882, 
by a curious coincidence, being exactly the same as for the previous year, viz: 1,534. 
There were 435 degrees conferred in 1882, including 349 professional ones. Of the 75 
bachelors’ degrees, only 9 were in science, the rest being in arts, philosophy, and letters. 
Of the 11 masters’ degrees, 4 were in arts, 3 in science, and 1 each in letters and philoso- 
phy, besides 2 doctors of philosophy. 
Adrian College, Adrian, reports a larger attendance during 1880~’81 than for 12 years 
past, an advance in the entrance examinations in Latin and Greek, the establishment of 
a 3-year course in theology, a new chemical laboratory completed, and North Hall (which 
was destroyed by fire in November, 1880) rebuilt at a cost of about $13,000. ; 
_In Albion College, Albion, the courses of study have been reconstructed during the 
year in accordance with conclusions reached by the faculty as to the proper order of 
college work. Prevailing methods—placing as they do principles before facts, the ab- 
stract before the concrete, the remote before that which is near—the faculty deem un- 
philosophical, and the work has been planned so as to follow nature’s order, as that is 
understood. Science is taught before the history of science. In languages Englishis 
studied first, then contemporaneous foreign languages, then Latin and Greek. Attend- 
ance had increased and with it the interest in study. A year has been added to the pre- 
paratory course, giving opportunity to test more fully the merits of the new plan. 
Another change noted is the introduction of university methods of study. Instead of 
daily recitations, a considerable portion of the work in the junior and senior years is now 
carried on through a system of individual investigations on the part of the student, aided 
by advice from the teachers. a 
Besides the university, 7 institutions in this State report themselves as engaged in 
collegiate work, viz: Adrian College, Albion College, Battle Creek College, Hillsdale 
College, Hope College (at Holland), Kalamazoo College, and Olivet College. In Grand 
Traverse College, Benzonia, there were no college students during the year. Classical 
courses of 4 years were provided by the institutions above named, and scientific courses 
by all except Hope College, the scientific also comprising 4 years in all except Battle 
Creek, where only 3 years were required to complete it. Besides the State University, 
Adrian, Albion, and Hillsdale Colleges add philosophical ‘courses, Kalamazoo offers a 
Latin scientific course, and Olivet a course for ladies, all of 4 years. Business training 
was given by 2 colleges, normal by 5, musical by 6, art by 3, and theological by 3, while, 
as above noted, the State University makes provision for instruction in medicine, phar- 
macy, and dentistry. All are open to both sexes. Four received gifts of money during 
the year amounting in all to $46,658, as follows: Albion, $4,000, to erect an astronomi- 
cal observatory; Hillsdale, $1,878, in small sums, to increaseendowment; Hope, $37,350, 
of which $22,250 was to pay a debt, $12,102 for endowment, and the remainder for cur- 
rent expenses; and Kalamazoo, $3,430, in small sums, for current expenses. Grand Tray- 
erse received from L. Bailey and wife, Benzonia, a gift of 80 acres of land, to be disposed 
of for the benefit of the college. 
For further statistics of the above colleges, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
The only collegiate institution exclusively for women, Michigan Female Seminary, 
Kalamazoo, under Presbyterian influence, reported 45 students, under 7 instructors, and 
2 graduates during the year.

  130 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Michigan State Agricultural College, Lansing, first opened in 1857, has sent out 
272 graduates, the class for 1882 numbering 28. The whole attendance was 219, of whom 
200 were in regular undergraduate classes, 17 in special or partial courses, and 2 in grad- 
uate studies. Besides other branches necessary to a good general education, instruction 
is given in surveying, levelling, laying out of grounds, mechanics as applied to imple- 
ments, building, stock breeding, agricultural chemistry, horticulture, and such practical 
applications of science as are specially useful to the farmer. Each student is required 
to perform 3 hours’ work on the farm or garden in order to render him familiar with the 
use of implements and the principles of agriculture, as well as to preserve in him habits 
of manual labor and to foster a taste for agricultural pursuits. Most of the labor is paid 
for. A part of it is educational and is varied for the illustration of the principles of 
science. For some time a proposition has been under consideration to establish a depart- 
ment in mechanics, to be subsidiary to that in agriculture. A committee appointed to 
consider the subject has reported favorably and estimates of expenses have been sub- 
mitted. 
All the collegiate institutions of the State, except Hope College, as already mentioned, 
provide courses leading to the degree of B. s., the State University adding others in 
civil, mechanical, and mining engineering. The courses in the latter comprise mathe- 
matics, French, German, English, physics, general chemistry, mineralogy, astronomy, 
and drawing, besides the technical branches peculiar to each, and require 4 years for 
completion, as also do the scientific courses in all the other colleges except Battle Creek, 
where the degree is given after only 3 years’ study.

and X of the appendix, and for summaries, corresponding tables in the report of the 
Commissioner preceding.    
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction was given in Adrian, Battle Creek, and Hillsdale Colleges, all 
having coursesof3 years. In Adrian College, which is under Methodist influence, under- 
graduate students of the collegiate department are allowed tosubstitute theological studies 
for certain others in the collegiate curriculum and are thus enabled to complete the theo- 
logical course in two years after graduation. Persons advanced in life or such as from 
other causes cannot devote 3 years to theological study are allowed to pursue a shorter 
course if in the judgment of the faculty they have a fitness for the ministry. 
Hillsdale College (Free Will Baptist) offers 2 courses, a classical and an English, both 
of 3 years. Students who complete the former receive the degree of B. D.; those who 
complete the latter are given a diploma. 
The department of theology in Battle Creek College (Seventh Day Baptist) includes a 
preparatory course of 2 years as well as a biblical one of 3, the latter including Greek and 
Hebrew. 
For statistics of theological schools reporting, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal instruction is given in the law school of Michigan University in a course of 2 
years, embracing the several branches of constitutional, international, maritime, com- 
mercial, and criminal law, medical jurisprudence, and the jurisprudence of the United 
States. Applicants for admission who are candidates for a degree must pass such an 
examination as will satisfy the faculty of the adequacy of their literary attainments, 
unless graduates of some collegiate institution, normal school, or other school of corre- 
sponding grade. Of 333 students attending during 1881~’82, there were 61 who had 
received degrees in letters or science. The graduating class numbered 170. 
For further statistics, see Table XII of the appendix, and for a summary,the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
The medical schools reporting are the medical department of the University of Michi- 
gan, Detroit Medical College, the homeopathic medical department of the University 
of Michigan, and the Michigan College of Medicine, Detroit. All follow the ‘‘regular”’ 
practice, except the homeopathic department of Michigan University. The 3 regular 
schools reported a total of 500 matriculates for the year and 121 graduates; the other 
school, 71 matriculates and 15 graduates. 
The two medical departments of Michigan University offer and require for gradua- 
tion a graded course of 3 years, the annual lecture term extending over 34 weeks. An 
examination for admission is also required. Before receiving a diploma students must 
pass a satisfactory examination on all the branches, practical anatomy and chemical 
analysis included. ..There are also two extended optional courses, one in physiological
-P-A-G-E-425

and pathological chemistzy, the other in toxicology. The course for women is in all re- 
spects equal to that for men. Practical anatomy is pursued by the two sexes in separate 
rooms, which is also the case in some of the lectures; but in most of the latter, also in 
public clinics, the chemical laboratory, and various other classes, it is found that both 
may with propriety be united. 
Detroit Medical College offers and recommends but does not require a 3-year graded 
course of study. In order to graduate, students must take this course or else 2 full 
courses of lectures not within the same year, must pass an examination on all the 
branches taught in the college, take a full course in dissection, a course in the chemical 
and physiological laboratory, and 1 term in hospital and out of door clinics. An exami- 
nation for admission is required of candidates not graduates of a high school or academy 
or matriculates of some college or medical school. 
Michigan College of Medicine, Detroit, also recommends but does not require a 3-year 
graded course of study. To graduate, students must have studied medicine 3 years, in- 
cluding 2 full courses of lectures, each being of 23 weeks, and pass a satisfactory examina- 
tion in all the branches. Applicants for admission not graduates of college, high school, 
or other recognized educational institution must pass an examination. 
Dentistry is taught in the College of Dental Surgery of the University of Michigan, 
which strongly recommends a 3-year graded course of study, but presents a course of 
only 2 years for the convenience of those who cannot take the langer one. Three years’ 
study of dentistry, however, is required for graduation, 2 of them to be in this college. 
Students attend the regular lectures in the department of medicine and surgery, thus 
receiving a complete course in surgery, both didactic and clinical; they are required to 
take a course in histology and in analysis of saliva; also, to attend lectures in inorganic 
and organic chemistry. . 
The school of pharmacy connected with Michigan University gives a training adapted 
to service in commercial, analytical, and manufacturing chemistry and pharmacy, lay- 
ing a foundation for the practice of the dispensing pharmacist, the general analyst, the 
wholesale druggist, and the manufacturing chemist. The course is graded and occu- 
pies as yet only 2 years, but it is contemplated to extend it to 3. This is found neces- 
sary, more especially for the increasing number of graduates who become analytical and 
manufacturing chemists. Graduates must passa satisfactory examination on all branches 
in the course, and they must have also passed a preliminary examination for admission. 
Experience in the business of pharmacy is not a requisite for a degree. A second de- 
gree is offered to resident graduates on presenting satisfactory work in original research 
to an extent representing the work of a full college year. 
For statistics of medical, dental, and pharmaceutical schools reporting, see Table XIII 
of the appendix; for a summary of these statistics, a corresponding table in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB, 
The Michigan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Flint, reports a fall 
school list for 1881-’82. More pupils attended than could be well accommodated and 
an appropriation was asked of the State legislature to provide additional buildings. 
The whole number of pupils was 249; teachers, 13, of whom 3 were deaf-mutes and 2 
semi-mutes. Only 4 belonged to the graduating class of 1882, a much smaller number 
than that of the classes in many preceding years, owing to the fact that the legislature 
has recently extended the time aJlowed to complete the course from 8 to 10 years, and 
many gladly availed themselves of the two additional years. The average time spent 
by each pupil is about 7 years. The latter part is equally divided between the different 
industries and the schools, which include primary, grammar, and academic departments. 
The training received in the industrial department is-considered at least equal in value 
to that received in the schools. Many boys who are dull in their studies make the best 
mechanics and tradesmen. Cabinet making, boot and shoe making, printing, baking, 
and farming are taught to the boys; sewing, cutting, and fitting of garments and general 
housework, to the girls. 
The Lvangelical Lutheran Deaf-Mute Institute, Norris, is controlled by several Lutheran 
congregations. It owns 20 acres of land, the entire property is valued at $12,000, 
and 40 pupils attended during 1881-82. Instruction is given by the articulation method 
inreligion, the common branches, and natural history. Noemploymentsare taught, but 
pupils assist in the garden and in the kitchen.— (Return. ) 
The Class in Articulation for the Deaf, Marquette, a private institution, sends no re- 
port for 1881-82. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Michigan School for the Blind, Lansing, enrolled 63 pupils, a larger number than 
during the previous year; but, as in the case of the institution for the deaf and dumb,
-P-A-G-E-426
    132 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the number received is limited by the lack of accommodations. A good common school 
education is given here; also, training in such occupations as pupils are best able to 
pursue. The work is carried on in three departments, literary, music, and handicraft, 
the first enrolling the whole number of pupils; the second, 39; the last, 62. A specialty 
is made of music with a view to preparing pupils to teach this branch. Some increase is 
reported in the library facilities and other apparatus, but much more needs to be done 
in this direction.— (State report.) 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Michigan State Reform School, near Lansing, received 392 boys during the two 
years commencing September 30, 1880. There were 76 more committed during the 
latter than the former of the two years, an increase, it is remarked, the continuance of 
which would necessitate an early extension ef the accommodations. Fewer commit- 
ments would be made to the school, it is believed, if there were less desire on the part of 
many justices of the peace and constables to obtain fees and if more earnest efforts were 
made by agents of the State board of charities and corrections to find komes for those 
whose only crime is that they are homeless. Of the 346 boys who left the institution 
during the two years reported, 249 were discharged, 94 were granted leave of absence, 
2 escaped, and 1 died. A practice recently inaugurated of granting leave of absence on 
trial to boys who by good conduct have merited confidence has resulted most satisfactorily, 
only 9 of the boys so released having been returned, and some of these through no fault of 
theirs, but from lack of good home surroundings. The average time spent in the institu- 
tion by the boys released during the year was about 19 months, less by nearly 8 months 
than for several years. The intention is to give each a fair knowledge of the common 
English branches, except when he is to goto a home where he will be sent to school. 
All the boys attend school in the institution an average of 4} hours each day for 5 
days of the week and work the same length of time, performing the entire labor of the 
institution, including farming, house cleaning, laundry and dining room work, cooking, 
and making clothes, bedding, and shoes. 
The Michigan Reform School for Girls, Adrian, opened in August, 1881, up to Septem- 
ber 30, 1882, had received 85 girls. The courts have authority to commit to this school 
any girl between 7 and 17 years of age who shall be convicted of being a disorderly per- 
son or of having committed any offence not punishable by imprisonment for life, except 
she be deemed incorrigible. The sentence is until the girl is 21 years of age, but the time 
may,be reduced by the board of control as a reward for good conduct. The greataim of 
the school is to surround the girls with the atmosphere of home and to develop in them the * 
home instinct: They are housed in four pleasant cottages, the housework of which is all 
done by themselves under the supervision of teachers. A special sewing department, too, 
has been organized, with ateacher of dress cutting, fitting, and making. Connected with 
the chapel are school rooms where the afternoons are spent instudy, with one hour in the 
evening. There is a well chosen library of 179 volumes, from which pupils draw books 
once a week, 
EDUCATION IN PENAL INSTITUTIONS. 
Within a recent period the authorities in charge have given considerable attention to 
furnishing instruction in the common branches of an English education to the inmates of 
the penal institutions in this State. At each of them a competent instructor is em- 
ployed. At Jackson, 30 of the prison officers and at Ionia 13 inmate instructors aid the 
superintendent of the school in the work of instruction. The effect of the work is already 
apparent in its influence for good on the prisoners. During the year, 701 prisoners at 
Jackson and 335 at Ionia have availed themselves of the opportunity offered, and the 
progress made in many instances was surprising. 
EDUCATION OF POOR AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN. 
The State Public School for Poor and Dependent Children, Coldwater, receives children 
3 to 12 years of age, trains them as far as practicable in school studies and industries, 
and finds homes for them in families till they are 18 years of age, retaining guardian- 
ship even later. Since its opening in 1874, homes have been provided for 1,231 chil- 
dren, 824 boys and 407 girls. In the beginning there was room in the institution for 
only 150, but its capacity has been gradually increased so that now more than 300 are ac- 
commodated. The demand for admission has been greater, too, since 1881, when a law 
was passed forbidding any children admissible here to be placed in county poorhouses or 
with adult prisoners in jails. Another amendment made in 1881 provides that children 
of this school who are ill, and such as would be admitted hereif cured, are given treat- 
ment, board, and nursing at the university hospital, also transportation to and from it, 
free of charge. The experience of 8 years has confirmed confidence in the main prin- 
ciple on which the school is based, that it is only a temporary home for the child, who
-P-A-G-E-427
  
MICHIGAN. / 183 
is placed in a family home as soon as a suitable one can be found and the child can be 
prepared for it. The number received in 1881-’82 was 150; indentured, 175; returned 
to counties whence they came, 19; died, 2; remaining in school September 30, 1882, 311. 
The course of school study for such as can complete it apparently covers 6 years. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-second annual meeting of the Michigan State Teachers’ Association was 
held in Representative Hall, Lansing, December 27-29, 1882. Several of the committee 
rooms were made headquarters for a variety of interesting exhibits of school work, in- 
cluding drawings, written class work, and philosophical apparatus. The sessions were 
numerously attended and productive of much profit. The papers presented were upon 
live subjects and, on the whole, were of unusual merit. . The discussions were generally 
participated in and were real contributions to the consideration of the topics before the 
association. Among the topics considered were ‘‘The need of visible illustration and 
the proper use of apparatus,’’ ‘‘ Plans for country school-houses,’’ ‘‘ Ornamenting school 
grounds,’”’ ‘‘Science in primary schools,’ ‘‘Temperance,’’ ‘‘ From county institute to 
county normal,’’ and ‘‘'The microscope in our public schools.’”’ 
MEETING OF COUNTY SCHOOL EXAMINERS. 
In response to an invitation of the superintendent of public instruction to the mem- 
bers of the boards of county school examiners to meet in convention, a large number of 
these officers, together with other educationists of the State, met at Representative Hall, 
Lansing, December 27, 1882. After some remarks by State Superintendent Cochran, 
explanatory of the purposes of the meeting, reviewing the operations of the new school 
law, and relating to the outlook of the future, the following subjects were discussed by 
the convention: ‘‘ Certificates: their grades and requirements;’’ ‘‘ How to secure classi- 
fication and grading in district schools;’’ ‘‘The duties of the secretary of the board of 
examiners,’’ and ‘‘Ends to be attained and methods to be used by the examiners in 
their work for the schools.” 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
REV. JOHN D. PIERCE. 
Rev. John D. Pierce, ‘‘father of the Michigan school system’? and first State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, died at the home of his daughter, in Medford, Mass., April 
6, 1882, aged 85 years. He was born in Chesterfield, N. H., and lived with an uncle 
until twenty yearsofage. During boyhood he was allowed to attend school two months 
in each year. His uncle gave him his timea year before he arrived at his majority and 
then he worked as a farm laborer until he had saved $100. His grandfather gave hima 
like amount and then began the struggle for an education. Entering Brown University 
in 1818 and during his course teaching school three months each year to maintain him- 
self, he graduated in 1822. He was one year principalof Wrentham Academy, Mass., and 
in 1823 entered Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1825 he became pastor of a Congre- 
gational cwurch in Oneida County, N. Y., where he continued four years, then becoming 
principal of the Goshen Academy, in Connecticut. In 1831 he was sent by the Home 
Missionary Society to Michigan, where he labored as a missionary until 1836, when, on the 
organization of the State government, he was appointed superintendent of public instruc- 
tion. The schools of the Territory up to that time had been little else than private en- 
terprises, and to Mr. Pierce more than to any one else does Michigan owe her excellent 
educational system. Being an intimate friend of General Crary (a member of the conven- 
tion which framed the State constitution and chairman of the committee on education), 
Mr. Pierce discussed with him the principles which he thought should be adopted in lay- 
ing the foundation of a new State. They agreed that education should form a distinct 
branch of the State government and that the constitution ought to provide for an officer 
to have charge of the whole matter. This policy was adopted apd Mr. Pierce wasnom- 
inated by the governor and unanimously confirmed as the first incumbent of the office. 
During the next five months he perfected plans for the organization and support of pri- 
mary schools and a university with branches, also for the disposition of the university 
and primary school lands, which were adopted by the legislature. The matter of de- 
vising a plan for a university caused him greatanxiety, for it was said that no State insti- 
tution of the kind had ever succeeded. It was proposed by some to name the several 
private colleges then existing on paper the ‘‘ University of Michigan”’ and to distribute 
the income of the fund jor the support of a university to them in proportion to the num- 
ber of students. But Mr. Pierce opposed this scheme with all the influence he could 
   
-P-A-G-E-428
  134 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
bring to bear and succeeded in defeating it, though only by one votein the house. The 
effect of that one vote has been to give Michigan an institution of learning rivalling the 
best and oldest in the country. As State superintendent Mr. Pierce gave to school work 
five of the best years of his life, often travelling by night as well as day. In 1842 he 
resumed work in the ministry and continued it till 1847, when he was elected to the 
State legislature, where his influence was exerted against the extension of slavery in the 
Territories and in favor of the homestead exemption law. He was a member of the con- 
stitutional convention of 1850 and secured the incorporation of the homestead exemp- 
tion measures and the provisions for free schools.— (Lansing Republican. ) 
PROFESSOR ZELOTES TRUESDEL. 
The death of Prof. Zelotes Truesdel took from the ranks of Michigan educators one of 
the oldest, best known, and most active of the men whose names have been associated 
with the educational history of the State for the last quarter of a century. 
Professor Truesdel was born in New York in 1829, and the family removed to Michi- 
gan in 1843, Entering the university at Ann Arbor in 1853, the young man graduated 
in 1857 with the degree of bachelor of science. He then taught school in Moline, Cham- 
paign, and Springfield, I. Returning to Michigan, he was at once recognized as aleader 
in educational affairs. In 1876, 1878, and 1880 he was the democratic candidate for su- 
perintendent of public instruction ; although defeated, he received the hearty indorse- 
ment of hisown party and many votes from political opponents. He was the first superin- 
tendent of the State Public School at Coldwater, and during the year and a half in which 
he held this position effected the thorough organization of the institution. For nine 
years he was superintendent of the public schools of Flint, Mich. He was afterward 
superintendent of the Pontiac public schools for four years, when, on the failure of his 
health, he retired to Ann Arbor for rest and recreation. Immediately elected a member 
of the county board of school officers under the law of 1881, the board at once appointed 
him secretary, a position that imposed on him many and onerous duties. He bore a long 
illness bravely, and died February 26, 1882,at Ann Arbor. Asastudentand scholar Mr. 
Truesdel was careful, thorough, and practical; as an organizer of schools, a manager and 
disciplinarian, he was exact; and in his political and public educational work he was 
outspoken, incorruptible, and fearless. His personal friends were all who knew him 
and his friendships such as all were proud to share.

@ Census of 1880, From 1870 to 1875, when an annual census of ‘children of school age was taken, 61 per cent. of the school population enumerated was enrolled. Using the same proportion for 1882, the State superintendent estimates the present population to be 315,948. 6 This is the number employed in winter schools, there being 1,625 men and 2,711 women, In summer schools there were 4,000 teachers: 662 men and 3,338 women.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State there is a superintendent of public instruction, appointed for 2 years by the 
governor, with the advice and consent of thesenate; he isa member ex officio of the board of 
regents of the State university and secretary of the board of directors of the State normal 
schools; heis also associated with the governor and president of the university in the State 
high school board. For each county there is a superintendent of schools, elected for every 
2 years, who examines and licenses teachers. There is a board of 3 trustees for common 
school districts; for independent school districts, a board of 6 directors, which appoints 
3 competent persons as school examiners and may elect a superintendent of schools. The 
members of each board are chosen for 3 years. Women may vote and hold any office 
pertaining solely to the management of public schools. -

136 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all resident youth of school age without regard to color or nationality; and county boards of trustees and boards of education have power to admit pupils over 21 years of age or non-residents upon payment of such tuition as 
may be determined upon by the board. The schools are sustained from the proceeds of a State school fund, from a county tax of 1 millon $1, from the proceeds of liquor licenses, fines not otherwise appropriated, and the unclaimed proceeds arising from the sale of estrays, and from an optional district tax not to exceed 9 mills on $1 for schools or 10 mills for school-houses. Teachers must keep the registers properly on which the appor- 
tionment of State funds is based and return them to the district clerk at the close of each, eg in the absence of proof that this has been done the last month’s pay will be with- 
eld. 
The State appropriates $3,000 annually to defray the expenses of such teachers’ insti- 
tutes and other normal training as the State superintendent may deem necessary. The 
ene must have charge of each institute, and itis the duty of all teachers to attend. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics of 1881-82, as compared with 1880-’81, show an increase of 13,257 in en- 
rolment in the public schools and of 12,081 in average daily attendance in winter schools 
and 2,577 insummer schools. ‘The enrolment was 119,305 less than thenumber of youth 
of school age as estimated by State Superintendent Kiehle, who also thinks that 20 per 
cent, of those enrolled attend so short a. time that very little benefit is derived from 
the instruction they receive. In the available school fund there was an increase of 
$464,238; also, an increase in the income and expenditure. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Five schools of this class reported for 1882, 3 at Minneapolis, 1 at St. Paul, and 1 at 
Winona, with a total enrolment of about 150. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS, : 
Cities, towns, and villages of over 500 inhabitants, not under special law, may be or- 
ganized into independent school districts, with boards of education elected for a term of 
3 years by the people. A superintendent is elected by the board, of which he is a non- 
voting member ex officio and executive officer.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Minneapolis, whose schools are divided into primary, intermediate, grammar, and high, 
reports an increase since 1881 of 1,030 enrolled and of 483 in average daily attendance, 
with 9 more teachers. The estimated value of school property was $440,378, while the 
amount received for school purposes was $158,158. The high school had an enrolment 
of 241 pupils and graduated 16. The teachers met each month to discuss questions of 
discipline and teaching, and special subjects were selected for study by the teachers. 
St. Paul for 1882 reports a large increase in enrolment and average daily attendance 
in the public schools. The schools included all grades from primary to high, with spe- 
cial teachers of music, drawing, and penmanship. There were 17 school-houses reported, 
valued, with grounds, &c., at $379,100. Enrolment in private and parochial schools, 
3,610. 
” Stillwater reports a considerable increase in the last two yearsin enrolment in public 
schools and in average daily attendance. The average monthly salary of teachers be- 
low the principal was $54. The schools were taught 9 months. _ 
1The basis of apportionment is the number of children 5-21 enrolled in public schools having an 
aunual term of at least 3 months under a licensed teacher.

Winona reports 3 school-houses, with 1,826 sittings, valued at $147,500. The increase 
of enrolment for the year was 43, witha decrease of 32 in average daily attendance, but 
8 more teachers. There were special instructors in music, drawing, and penmanship. 
Enrolment in private and church schools, 220. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 3 State normal schools report a total of 34 teachers and '776 normal and 326 other 
students. The school at Mankato received $12,000 from the State; it gives 2 years to 
elementary studies and has a 3-year advanced course. St. Cloud normal receives the 
same amount from the State and, with two years of elementary study, gives an ad- 
vanced course of 2 years. The Winona school, which receives $14,000 from the State, 
presents an elementary course of 2 years, a 2-year advanced course, and a course of 1 year 
of professional instruction for those who pass an examination on the academic work of 
either the elementary or advanced course. The Kindergarten at Winona is under the 
auspices of this school. Students are admitted free to any State normal school on pass- 
ing the required examinations and agreeing to teach in the State atleast 2 years. All 
report instruction in vocal music and drawing, laboratories for chemical experiments, and 
model schools for practice teaching. There were 76 normal graduates in the last scho- 
lastic year, 71 of whom have engaged in teaching. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The provisions of the act of the legislature of 1881 regarding institutes were fully car- 
ried out, and 1 teacher from each normal school was elected to serve in institutes during 
a term of 9 months. There were 41 institutes held during the year 1882, with a total 
attendance of 2,151, an increase of 1,321 over the preceding year. Every county apply- 
ing was furnished with an institute and lectures were given gratuitously by teachers of 
the State University and normal schools. Educational subjects were thoroughly dis- 
cussed with a view to gaining the best results of experience and applying them to the 
work of the State. The legislature appropriates $3,000 annually to defray the expenses 
of these institutes. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Summer courses of instruction in botany, geology, German, English, rhetoric, and 
elocution, with lectures and laboratory work, were opened at the University of Minne- 
sota July 5, 1882, and continued 5 weeks. These courses offered to teachers the advan- 
tages of the State University in preparing themselves for teaching literature and the 
sciences. There were 73 teachers in attendance. Minneapolis Academy, Minneapolis; 
Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter; and Rochester Classical School, Rochester, con- 
tinued their normal training. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Minnesota Journal of Education, a monthly begun in December, 1881, continued 
in 1882 to give efficient aid to the educational interests of the State, and was well sup- 
ported by the teachers. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
State aid isafforded for the encouragement of higher education through the development 
of a system of secondary schools, which is in charge of the State ‘‘high school board.”” 
There were 39 graded high schools receiving aid from the State. Students graduated 
from any of these schools were admitted to the University of Minnesota without further 
examination. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (non-sectarian), continued in 1881-’82 to 
offer free instruction to all persons over 14 years of age who passed the required exami- 
nation. The university contains a collegiate department and colleges of mechanic arts, 
agriculture, and science, literature, and the arts. Colleges of medicine and law are pro- 
jected. 
The other colleges reported for 1882 were Hamline University, Hamline (Methodist 
Episcopal), Augsburg Seminary, Minneapolis (Lutheran), each with 4-year classical 
courses; Carleton College, Northfield (Congregational), with a 3-year preparatory depart- 
mentand 4 courses of study of 4 years each; St. John’s College, Collegeville (Roman Cath- 
olic), giving classical, scientific, and commercial instruction in courses of varying length.

  138 REPORT OF ‘THE COMMISSIONER ‘OF EDUCATION. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The University of Minnesota, Carleton College, and Hamline University gave equal 
privileges to young women. St. Mary’sHall, Faribault (Protestant Episcopal), and Ben- 
nett Seminary, Minneapolis (non-sectarian), offered collegiate instruction to young 
women only. Both presented preparatory, collegiate, and English and classical courses 
of 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. ‘ 
For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary of them, the report of the 
Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State University, in its College of Agriculture, follows up 2 years of work in the 
collegiate department with special training for 2 years in botany, zodlogy, anatomy, 
physiology, and other sciences relating to agriculture. Its College of Mechanic Arts 
also presents 3 courses of 2 years each, following 2 years of collegiate work. Graduates 
receive degrees in civil or mechanical engineering and in architecture. Day and even- 
ing courses are given in mechanical drawing. A course in shop work was instituted in 
1881-’82 in a building constructed for that purpose and furnished with appliances for 
wood work, vise work, and forging; the appliances included a steam engine, forges, an- 
vils, and forging tools. ‘Ten young men took the vise or forge work under the direction 
of aprofessor. A summer school of science provided free teaching in botany, chemistry, 
and geology for public school teachers and others. 
Carleton College is supplied with all the apparatus necessary for the practical study of 
meteorology and astronomy. It has also a “science building’? for the pursuit of scien- 
tific studies and the higher grade of mathematics. 
Augsburg Seminary, Hamline University, and St. John’s College also offer special sci- 
entific courses. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology is taught at Seabury Divinity School, Faribault (Protestant Episcopal), Augs- 
burg Seminary, Minneapolis (Lutheran), and St. John’s College, Collegeville (Roman 
Catholic). All have preparatory departments for those who are not college graduates 
and cannot take a collegiate course. 
Medicine is taught at the Minnesota College Hospital, which was inaugurated in 1881 
under a union of the faculty of the hospital with that of St. Paul Medical College. The 
fall course of lectures covers 3 years of 19 weeks each. Candidates for admission must 
be at least 18 years of age and pass the required examination. The matriculates of 
1881-’82 numbered 25, under 21 professors; graduates, 5. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Minnesota Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Faribault, reports 
- for the two years ending November, 1882, an enrolment of 169 pupils, of whom 74 were 
girls. Eleven were graduated or discharged in 1881, and 12 in 1882. The average time 
in school is 5.3 years. The common English branches are taught, and about one-third 
are taught articulation and lip reading by a special teacher. The day is divided into two 
sessions, one for intellectual and the other for industrial work. The latter, with a fore- 
man for each class, teaches sewing, shoemaking, tailoring, printing, and carpentry. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The State School for the Blind, Faribault, had in 1882 an attendance of 35 pupils un- 
der 7 instructors. In addition to the common school studies instruction is given in vocal 
and instrumental music. In the industrial department, in charge of skilled instructors, 
pupils are taught broom making, sewing, knitting, and the simpler kinds of housework. 
Thecourse of study covers 8 years. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Minnesota Training School for Idiots and Imbeciles, Faribault, has become one of 
the permanent institutions of the State. ‘The advancement in the school work is reported. 
to be very encouraging. Children are taught to read, write, count, sing, weave mats, 
and do housework. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Minnesota State Reform School, St. Paul, in its report for 1882 gives 123 in- 
mates, who were taught the common English studies, the hours out of school being de- 
voted to learning some useful trade. ‘The institution was organized in 1868, since which 
time 450 children have been connected with the school.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
MINNESOTA STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The seventh annual session of the Minnesota Educational Association was held at St. 
Paul, December 27-29, 1882, conducted by President Shepard. The following are some 
of the subjects of addresses and discussions: Current criticisms upon the public schools; 
penmanship and free hand drawixg in the public schools; the law of evolution in educa- 
tion; educational conversation; industrial education. A lecture on national aid to educa- 
tion was delivered by Rev. A. D. Mayo, of Boston, Mass. There were 400 teachers present 
and the discussions were practical and excellent throughout. The association adjourned 
to meet &t Minneapolis in 1883. 
CONVENTION OF couNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The second annual convention of the county superintendents met at St. Paul, Decem- 
ber 26, 1882. There were 37 members present, with President O. M. Lord in the chair. 
‘The opening address was delivered by Hon. D. L. Kiehle, who said the all absorbing prob- 
lem was ‘good teachers: how to get and how to keep them,”’ and that the four elements 
of the best type of teachers are natural adaptation and character, academic knowledge 
professional training, and experience, Mr. Kiehle advocated a graded course of study 
and institute instruction. Normal schools, competent supervision, and remedies for tar- 
diness and irregular attendance were freely discussed by the various superintendents.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
By constitutional provisions the officers for general supervision are a State superin- 
tendent of public education, elected at the same time as the governor, for 4 years; a 
State board of education of 3 members, including the superintendent, for the management 
of school funds; a superintendent of public education in each county, appointed by the 
State board for 2 years’ service; and 3 trustees chosen annually by the patrons of each 
school in townships, or by the mayor and aldermen in incorporated towns, to select 
teachers, protect property, provide fuel, and visit the school or schools each month.
-P-A-G-E-435
  MISSISSIPPI. 141 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The ordinary school districts in Mississippi are counties, but incorporated towns with 
1,000 or more inhabitants may become separate school districts if the mayor and alder- 
men so determine. Schools for white and colored children, as elsewhere at the South, 
are required to be separate. Teachers must have certificates of qualification correspond- 
ing to the grade of school they are to teach, these certificates to be signed by the super- 
intendent having supervision of the school. The minimum annual time of school is five 
months, except when the maintenance of one for that time would require for county 
school purposes a tax of more than $7.50 on each $1,000 of property, when it may be 
made four months. The support of the schools of the State system comes from a State 
distributable fund of $200,000 annually apportioned among the counties according to the 
number of children of school age in each; from township funds, mainly the proceeds of 
old land grants; and from municipal and county taxes. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
For the year 1882 there is little information, the last biennial State report having 
covered the years 1880 and 1881. From a written return for 1882 it appears that there 
was a gain of 24,168 in school population and of $241,878 in receipts over 1880-’81, but 
a loss of 17,671 in average monthly enrolment, of 23,749 in average daily attendance, 
and of 805 in teachers. ‘hese apparent reductions, however, may be due to incomplete 
returns. 
PEABODY FUND. 
For 1882 the agent of the Peabody fund trustees allotted to the State $4,275, of which 
$1,200 went for teachers’ institutes, $300 for public schools, and $2,775 for the training 
of specially selected teachers at the State Normal School, Nashville, Tenn. ‘Since 1868 
Mississippi has received nearly $70,000 from this fund. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Only a single Kindergarten in this State is on the list of this Bureau for 1881-’82, and 
from that one no report hasbeen received. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
OFFICERS. 
Any incorporated town of 1,000 or more inhabitants may constitute a separate school 
district, if the mayor and aldermen so elect; a board of 3 trustees may be appointed an- 
nually by the mayor and aldermen, to be governed by the same laws as trustees of other 
schools, the county superintendent having the same jurisdiction over city as over county 
schools.— (Code of 1880.) 
STATISTICS OF VICKSBURG. 
The only city with over 7,500 inhabitants, according to the census of 1880, was Vicks- 
burg, with 11,814. In 1881~’82 a school population of 3,671 was reported, an enrolment 
of 1,220 in public schools, an average daily attendance of 900, 21 teachers, 2 school build- 
ings, with 1,100 sittings, and school property valued at $14,400. In private and parochial 
schools there was an estimated enrolment of 500. The school sittings were more than 
sufficient for the actual attendance; but provided for only 30 per cent. of the school pop- 
ulation, of which only 33 per cent. was enrolled in public schools. Adding the 500 in 
private and parochial schools, only 47 per cent. of the youth of school age were receiving 
instruction.— (Return. ) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Mississippi State Normal School, Holly Springs, in 1881-’82 had 3 resident instruc- 
tors and 136 students, of whom 91 were males and 45 females. Two graduates of the 
school engaged in teaching, having completed the regular 4-year course of 40 weeks each. 
The object of this school is simply to prepare teachers for their work, none being admit- 
ted who do notintend to become teachers. To be admitted, males must be 15 and females 
14 years of age and must pass an examination in arithmetic, grammar, geography, spell- 
ing, and reading. The standard is raised every year to keep pace with the advancing 
standard of State requirements for teachers’ licenses. All the studies of the course are 
compulsory. Tuition is free to all coming from the State, the appropriation for the year 
being $3,000.

142 REPORT..OF ‘THE: COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
OTHER NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
Iuka Normal Institute, for both sexes, Iuka, appears for the first time on the list of 
normal schools, it having been organized as a normal school apparently in 1882, with 6 
professors and instructors. The scholastic year embraces 4 terms of ten weeks each. 
There is a course of 3 years, following a preparatory course of undefined length, but what 
portion must be completed in order to graduate is not distinctly stated. Special promi- 
nence is given to the training department.— (Circular. ) 
Natchez Seminary, Natchez, for training preachers and teachers for the colored people 
of the South, is under the care of the American Baptist Home Mission Society. In 
1881-’82 there were 5 instructors and 80 male and 40 female normal students, of whom 7 
graduated from its 3-year course of 34 weeks each and engaged in teaching. A library 
of 400 volumes was. increased by 50 during the year. Each student pays $8 a year for 
tuition.— (Return and catalogue.) 
Tougaloo University, Tougaloo, had 12 instructors and lecturers, 56 normal students, a 
library of 900 volumes, and a State appropriation for the year of $3,000. The annual 
charge for tuition is $8. The school has chemical and physical apparatus, a museum of 
natural history, a gymnasium, and a model school. Instruction was given in vocal and 
instrumental music. An English course prepares teachers for the common schools, and 
a normal course, for the higher grades of schools; each course covers 3 years. Pupils 
» are admitted irrespective of sect or race.°* Every student is trained in some industry, 
being required to work 1 hour each day.— (Return and catalogue. ) 
‘The normal department of Rust University, formerly Shaw University, Holly Springs, 
continued in 1881-’82 to fit students of both sexes for the work of teaching, in a course 
of 4 years.— (Catalogue. ) 
The Union Female College, Oxford, reported in 1879-80 a normal department, in which 
instruction was given in methods of teaching and school organization and management, 
using classes from the preparatory department as a model school. No later information 
rom it has been received. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
While there is no State provision for holding teachers’ institutes, $1,200 from the Pea- 
body fund enabled the State superintendent to hold 5 in different parts of the State, 
under the instruction of L. A. Rainwater, of Mississippi, and E. 8. Willington, of Ten- 
nessee. They are said to have done much good for the cause of education. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
‘There being no educational serial published in the State in 1881-82, the American 
Journal of Education, at St. Louis, Mo., continued to: publish a Mississippi edition, 
edited by J. M. Barrow. Considering the main defects in the present school system 
to be a lack of normal schools and teachers’ institutes, with defective local supervision, 
Mr. Barrow was to give these matters his earnest attention. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
There appears no change in the law of 1878, which recognized private academies and 
colleges having suitable school buildings, libraries of not less than 200 volumes, ‘and a 
faculty of good standing as high schools qualified to prepare students for the university. 
For such students an allowance is made equal to the estimated cost of their education in 
the public schools. é 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix; for summaries of them, 
corresponding tables in the report of the Comnijssioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. ¢ 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Mississippi, Oxford, continued in 1881-82 its 3 general departments 
of instruction: (1) the preparatory or university high school, covering 2 years instead of 
the former 3; (2) that of science, literature, and the arts (including the courses for B. A. 
and B. 8., each of 4 years), an elective course for B. PH. embracing the studies of any 7 of 
the existing 10 departments, and 2 graduate courses; and (3) that of professional edu- 
cation, for which, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, p. 143. In the preparatory 
department were 92 students, under 3 instructors; in the college, a faculty of 10 resident 
professors and instructors, with 108 undergraduate and 2 graduate students. Instruc-  
-P-A-G-E-437

tion is given in political economy throughout the fourth year of all the undergraduate 
courses. The libraries of the university contained about 6,000 volumes ; the entire prop- 
erty was valued at $400,000; productive funds of $544,000 gave an income of $32,640, 
and there was a State appropriation of $10,500.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Mississippi College retained in 1881-82 its feature of estimating scholarship only by 
attamments, and conterred degrees on the mastery of studies, not when a fixed course 
had been pursued. Only in the preparatory department, covering 6 years, is there any 
regular curriculum. In the college there are schools. of mental and moral sciences, 
Greek, Latin, mathematics, natural science, English, and modern languages; there is 
also acommercial department. Nostudent falling below 63 in his general average for the 
whole course (the maximum being 8) is entitled to a degree, while anyone reaching as 
high as 74 in his general average for any year is enrolled as ‘‘distinguished.’’? With a 
library of 2,000 volumes, property was valued at $30,000, and there were $8,000 in pro- 
ductive funds.— (Catalogue and return.) 
: Rust University changed its name from ‘‘Shaw’’ June, 1882, the statisties for the year 
ending at this date. There were 5 in the faculty, 4 of them residents, with 278 students, 
51 being in college studies, of whom 14 were females. The college is open to both sexes. 
There is an academic course of 8 years, 4 of them preparatory, with a collegiate course of 
4 years, but nearly three-fourths of the students are in the preparatory academic course. 
The department of music receives increased attention from year to year.— (Catalogue 
and return. ) 
For statistics of these colleges, see Table IX of the appendix; for summaries of them, 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Out of the 11 schools of this class on the list heretofore reported, 8 make returns for 
1881~’82, the same number as in 1880-81; all, as then, reported preparatory train- 
ing, and several preceded this by elementary English studies ; all showed advanced 
English courses, and most of them classical courses of 4 years; while some so arrange 
their studies that each branch is taught in separate schools, with no specified time of 
study for each class, that depending on the ability and industry of the student. All offer 
training in vocal and instrumental music, 7 in drawing, and 6 in French and German. 
For statistics of these schools reporting, see Table VIII of the appendix; for a summary 
of the same, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
- SCIENTIFIC. 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi, Oktibbeha County, had a 4-year 
collegiate and 3-year agricultural course. Tuition is free to students from Mississippi, 
and none others have thus far been received. Work on the farm is required of all students 
during 10 or 12 hours a week.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, Rodney, is the State institution for the scien- 
tific instruction of young colored men. It reports 4 instructors for 188182, with 105 
students, in its preparatory course of 2 years, and 3 professors, with 143 students, in its 
scientific course of 4 years. It had a library of 150 volumes, property valued at $43,000, 
and a State appropriation of $11,000 for the year. (Return. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—The Bishop Green Associate Mission and Training School, Dry Grove, 
(Protestant Episcopal), heretofore reported as giving preparatory training in theology, 
furnishes no information for 1881-82. The Protestant Episcopal Almanac reports 4 can- 
didates for orders. 
In Rust University, Holly Spring (Methodist Episcopal), students, while pursuing a 
full college course, take also such theological studies as are prescribed by the general 
conference. 
In the Natchez Seminary, Natchez (Baptist), where the same system. seems to prevail, 
there were 30 students preparing for the ministry. 
Legal.—Law was studied by 12 students in a 2-year course (heretofore reported as 1 
year) in the University of Mississippi, under 1 professor and 5 lecturers. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Jackson, showed anadvance 
in its material condition since 1880-81. A department for colored mutes was opened 
October 1, with 15 pupils, in a separate building a mile from the city, the white and

colored boys working together on the farm. During the year the grounds in the city 
had been enlarged and a school building erected, providing ample rooms and a chapel; 
anew shop building, for instruction in printing, carpentry, and shoemaking, was nearly 
completed; and the publication of a paper was to begin in the following February. 
There had been, since opening, 148 pupils under instruction, of whom 80 were on the roll 
during the year, 20 being semi-mutes. There were 6 instructors, 2 of whom were deaf- 
mutes and 2.semi-mutes. A new teacher of articulation had entered upon her work 
with promise of great success. Its school property was valued at $60,000, $20,000 being 
expended in buildings and $10,000 for other purposes of the school during the year. 
There was a library of 300 volumes.— (American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Mississippi Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Jackson, reported for 1882 
14 instructors and other employés, 3 employés and workmen being blind, with 35 pupils. 
For industries the pupils were taught broom making, chair seating, mattress making, 
and upholstery; in the school, the usual English branches taught in first class schools. 
There were 490 volumes. in the- library, among which are the quota from the provision 
made by the General Government to furnish books and apparatus suitable for the blind 
and a Bible in raised print, given by a former pupil of the institution, now deceased, 
Miss Helen Wilbourn. The State appropriation for the year was $10,000. The prop- 
erty of the institution was valued at $45,000. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 
An act of March, 1878, requires the holding of an annual convention of principals and 
presidents of high schools and colleges, styled as above. It is believed that the annual 
meeting of 1882 was held, but no record of it has come to hand. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROFESSOR ROBERT F. KEDZIE. 
Prof. Robert F. Kedzie, of the Mississippi Agricultural College, died February 24, 1882, 
aged 29 years. He wasa son of Prof. R. C. Kedzie, of the Michigan Agricultural College, 
from which college the son graduated with honor in 1871. After spending two years 
on a farm he became his father’s assistant in the laboratory. Remaining here until 
1877, he temporarily filled the position of his brother, Will. K. Kedzie, in the Kansas 
Agricultural College, returning at the end of a year to his former work at Lansing. In 
the spring of 1879 Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, president of the Mississippi Agricultural College, 
offered him the position of professor of chemistry and agriculture in his college. He 
accepted the place and filled it with honor until his death, three years later.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the general supervision of the entire educational interests of the State there is a 
board of education, composed of the governor, secretary of state, and attorney general, 
with a superintendent of public schools, elected every 4 years, who is president of the 
board and ex officio member of the board of regents of each of the State normal schools.

  146 REPORT: OF: THE: COMMISSIONER OF: EDUCATION, 
For each county there is a school commissioner elected biennially, whose duties are to 
examine applicants for teachers’ certificates and to report educational statistics, &c., to 
the State superintendent. In each school district a board of school directors of three 
members, elected for terms of 3 years, chooses a clerk, employs the teachers, visits the 
schools, takes care of the school property, &c. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all persons from 6 to 20 years of age in the State. In 
addition to local taxation and 25 per cent. of the entire State revenue (a portion of this 
latter being used for the State university), they enjoy the income from a school fund 
ae held in counties and townships) consisting of the proceeds of all lands not 
otherwise appropriated, the net proceeds of the State tobacco warehouse, of the sale of 
all property that may accrue to the State by escheat, from sale of estrays, from unclaimed. 
dividends or distributive shares of the estates of deceased persons, or from fines, penalties, 
or forfeitures, and all unspecified gifts, grants, or devises. Local district taxes are not to 
exceed 40 cents on the $100 for school purposes, except that by a majority vote of tax- 
payers 65 cents may be allowed in country districts and $1 in cities and towns to pur- 
chase a site and build and furnish a school-house ; besides which, an additional tax may 
be levied if two-thirds of the qualified voters vote in favor thereof. Provision is made 
for union districts. Separate schools must be established in districts containing 16 or 
more colored children. Teachers must present certificates from the State superintendent 
or county commissioner where they intend to teach and make monthly reports of all re- 
quired statistics and a summary report of the whole term at its close. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics of 1882 show an increase of 19,429 in the total attendanceof white youth 
and an apparentdecrease of 1,190 in colored. There were also 155 more schools for white 
children and 18 fewer for colored. The statistics are far from complete, since many 
counties failed to report. Although more school buildings were reported, the estimated 
value of school property had decreased $1,089,319. The average salary of teachers was 
not given for 1881, but in 1880 the pay of men was $35 and of women $30, and the re- 
turns for 1882 show an advance in two years of $9 for men and $8 forwomen. The schools 
seem to be ina very prosperous condition, and the State superintendent claims for Missouri 
the largest permanent productive school fund of any State in the Union. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
The St. Louis city report gives 8,730 children, nearly all under 6 years of age, as en- 
rolled in the public Kindergarten in 1881-’82, 4,805 receiving Kindergarten instruction 
only. For other statistics, see Table V of the appendix. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Any city, town, or village may constitute a school district, and for the management of 
its educational interests elect a board of 6 directors for 3 years; a president, secretary, and 
treasurer of the board are chosen from among its members. Graded schools similar to 
those of other public school districts are to be established by this board.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Hannibal reported 3,146 white children of school age and 709 colored. The average 
salary of men teachers was $88.88, and that of women $36.94. Schools were taught 172 
of the 175 school days. Cases of suspension numbered 44 and of corporal punishment, 
229. The estimated value of all school property was $58,700.— (City report.) 
Kansas City’s public graded schools, occupying 13 buildings, report an increase of 416

in enrolment. There were 6,400 sittings for study and 103 teachers employed. ~ The 
estimated value of all school property was $356,055. 
St. Joseph reported 67 graded schools taught in 17 buildings, with 3,610 sittings for 
study, valued, with all other school property, at $174,225. Schools were taught 197 
days by 67 teachers, including 3 special teachers in music, drawing, and penmanship. 
‘There was an increase of 985 in youth of school age, of 260 in enrolment, and of 94 in 
average daily attendance. The total receipts for school purposes were $70,068. The 
enrolment in private schools was 635. z 
St. Louis grades its schools from Kindergarten to high and supports a girls’ normal 
school and 16 evening schools, these last having an enrolment of 3,300 pupils, under 52 
teachers, the average attendance in them being 1,655. In the day schools 2 special 
teachers of music and drawing were employed. Private schools enrolled 21,000. ‘The 
total receipts for public schools amounted to $935,289 and the estimated value of school 
property was $3,079,699. The salary of a teacher is regulated by position, not sex, and 
many ladies, as principals of first class schools, receive the maximum annual salary of 
$2,000. Although married teachers may be employed or reappointed, the marriage of a 
female teacher is considered equivalent to a resignation. Nearly nine-tenths of the 
teachers are ladies. Notwithstanding the extra cost of the public Kindergirten, the 
president of the school board considers them amply justified on considerations of public 
policy. There were no considerable changes in the enrolment and attendance of the va- 
rious branches of the city schools, but public educational work, as a whole, was reported 
to be in a satisfactory condition. A revival is noted in the study of German, the num- 
ber of pupils at present engaged in acquiring the language being 21,'712, about two-thirds 
of them in the primary grades. The St. Louis Public School Library numbers 52,000 
volumes of well selected books. 
Sedalia reported 26 schools, classified as primary, grammar, and high, in 5 buildings, 
with 1,790 sittings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $84,000. Schools were in session 179 
of the 180 school days, and had increased in enrolment 476 in the last year. There were 
300 pupils in private schools. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Missouri maintains 6 normal schools: one connected with the State University, Colum- 
bia, one with the State College, Rolla, and 3 others for white students, at Kirksville, 
Warrensburg, and Cape Girardeau, called first, second, and third district normal schools. 
Lincoln Institute, the normal school at Jefferson City, is for the education of colored 
teachers. ‘% ; 
The district normals are under the control of boards of regents of 7 members, appointed 
by the governor for 6 years, the State superintendent being ex officio a member of each 
board, The 4-year courses of study in the district normals are substantially the same. 
Teachers’ certificates good for 2 years in the State are given at the end of 2 years, cer- 
tificates for 3 years at the end of another year of study, and a State certificate and diploma 
with appropriate degree to those taking the full 4-year course. Kirksville (first district) 
reported 481 students, with 10 instructors; 9 students were graduated in the last scholas- 
tic year, 8 of whom were teaching. Warrensburg (second district) gives 11 instructors, 
with 395 students in the normal department and 68 in the school of practice. There 
were 30 graduated from the 2-year course, 5 from the 3-year, and 9 from the 4-year course, 
280f whom engaged in teaching. Cape Girardeau (third district) hada faculty of 8mem- 
bers, with 225 students and a graduating class of 25. 
The dean of the normal department of the State University at Columbia has the assist- 
ance of 14 other instructors in the university. To graduates from the full course a per- 
manent State certificate is given, and to those from the lower course a certificate good. 
for 3 years. This department is sustained from the general fund of the university, 
OTHER NORMAL INSTRUCTION, 
La Grange College, La Grange, reports a normal department, in which instruction is 
given by the college professors in the general science of education and in the theory and 
practice of teaching. There were 54 students in this department, with 5 graduates. 
: The St. Louis Normal School, maintained by the city for the training of young women 
to teach in the city public schools, had a 2-year course. The students for the year num- 
bered 68, 33 of whom graduated and received certificates to teach in the city schools 
without further examination. 
The School of Mines and Metallurgy, Rolla, has a teachers’ course covering 2 years, each 
year under the charge of a special teacher, the instructor for the first year being a lady. 
Graduates from this course receive first class certificates good for 2 years. 
Lincoln Institute reports a 5-year preparatory and a 4-year normal course. Boys are

tention is given to the study of German. Sedalia high school enrolled 97 pupils, under 
2 teachers. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix fol-

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Missouri, Columbia, reported for 1881—’82 a faculty of 31 members, 
with 591 students, 82 being at Rolla. The departments of instruction are 10 academic 
schools (5 in science and 5 in the languages) and 9 professional schools, that of mining 
and metallurgy being at Rolla. 
Washington University, St. Louis, in its Smith’s Academy, for young men, and Mary 
Institute, for young women, gives thorough preparatory training for the collegiate courses 
in arts, philosophy, and science. Graduates of the two college courses of study of 4 years 
each are given the degree of bachelor of arts or bachelor of philosophy. There is a useful 
course in mechanical industries, combining English studies with shop work. Oppor- 
tunity is also given for training in art at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts, connected 
with the university ; also, free evening instruction at the polytechnic buildings as a prep- 
aration for industrial pursuits. 
- Among the other colleges nominally of this class the Southwest Baptist College, Bol- 
ivar, chartered in 1879, is reported to the Bureau for the first time, with a faculty of 8 
members and 40 students, with 154 in the preparatory department. In addition to the 
4-year scientific and classical courses, a commercial course is given, including instruction 
in drawing and shorthand. 
La Grange, La Grange, and William Jewell College, Liberty (Baptist); Christian Uni- 
versity, Canton (Christian) ; Central College, Fayette; Lewis College, Glasgow, and Central 
Wesleyan College, Warrenton (Methodist Episcopal); Drury College, Springfield (Congre-

(acelacttozianys and St. Louis University (Roman Catholic) all reported 4-year classical 
and scientific courses. St. Vincent’s College, Cape Girardeau (Roman Catholic), 
with a collegiate department covering 5 years, presents a 2-year course in theology. 
Grand River College, Edinburg (Baptist), offers a 4-year classical course and a scien- 
tific course covering 3 years, leading to the degree of B. 8. St. Joseph College, St. 
Joseph, and the College of the Christian Brothers (Roman Catholic), afford no certain 
indication of the standards maintained. Lincoln College, Greenwood (Methodist Epis- 
copal), failed to report for 1882. 
All of the above colleges reporting gave preparatory training of from 1 to 2 years. 
Christian and St. Louis Universities and Stewartsville College gave commercial courses. 
St. Louis University and Pritchett School Institute each provided a graduate course. 
Music, drawing, and painting were taught in several of the colleges above mentioned. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
All the above except Central, William Jewell, and the Roman Catholic colleges admit 
‘women as well as men. 
For statistics of colleges for women only, see Table VIII of the appendix; for those of 
colleges for young men or for both sexes, Table IX of the same; for summaries of the

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Missouri Agricultural and Mechanical College, at the University of Missouri, offers a 
2-year scientific course. The first year is essentially horticultural and the student who 
completes it is entitled to the certificate in horticulture. The second year is agricultural, 
and its studies, with those of the first year and those required for entering the senior 
year, make the full agricultural course, graduates from which are entitled to the corre- 
sponding degree. ‘To enter the junior class the student must pass a satisfactory exam- 
ination in arithmetic, English grammar, and geography. 
The Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy, Rolla, had a preparatory department and 
three courses of 3 years each, leading to the degrees of bachelor of philosophy, mining 
engineer, and civil engineer. There is also a teachers’ course; a girls’ course in arts; and 
an optional course, including book-keeping, drawing and painting, and the languages. 
The 0’ Fallon Polytechnic Institute, at Washington University, offers 5 courses, each 
covering 4 years, in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, mining and 
metallurgy, and building and architecture. The studies are the same for all during the 
first two years, but in the junior and senior years they lead to their appropriate degrees. 
The Manual Training School of Washington University had for its object instruction and 
practice in the use of tools, combined with the English branches of study, including draw- 
ing, the students dividing their working hours equally between mental and manual 
exercises. : 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.— Instruction is given in theology in a-slight degree at Christian University, 
and more fully at Central, Central Wesleyan, La Grange, Lewis, and St. Vincent’s Col- 
leges. Concordia College, St. Louis (Evangelical Lutheran), has a regular 3-yearcourse 
in theology. The Jeremiah Vardeman School of Theology in William Jewell College 
reports a full 2-year theological course; for those who desire, the course is so arranged 
as to be pursued in connection with a literary course which covers 5 years. Thorough 
instruction is said to be given in New Testament Greek. 
Law.— Legal instruction is offered at the Missouri University in a 2-year course, from 
which 20 students were graduated and received the degree of bachelor of law in 1882. 
Students were also permitted to take an elective course. St. Louis Law School in 
Washington University also gives a 2-year course of legal instruction, leading to the 
degree of LL. B. A weekly moot court is held regularly throughout the year by the dean, 
conducted as nearly as possible with the forms of an ordinary courtof justice. Gradu- 
ates from both of these law schools are admitted to practice in the courts of Missouri 
without further examination. 
Medical instruction was given in 1882 in 8 ‘‘regular”’ schools. The medical depart- 
ment of the University of Missouri required a preliminary examination in the English 
branches, with attendance subsequently on a 2-year graded course of 9 months each year, 
no student being allowed to attend both courses the same year. Kansas City Medical 
College and St. Joseph Hospital Medical College, St. Joseph, each had 3 years of study 
and 2 courses of lectures of 20 weeks each. Missouri Medical College, St. Louis, in 
addition to 2 courses of 20 weeks each for graduation, provided a graduate course for 
physicians desiring to perfect themselves in medical and surgical specialties. St. Louis 
Medical College had a 3-year graded. course of study, of 21 weeks each, with regular 
lecture courses and final. examination for the degree of M. D. ‘ 
Joplin College of Physicians and Surgeons, at Joplin, organized in 1880, required a 
preliminary examination in English, with 3 years of study and 2 courses of lectures of 
19 weeks. Regular attendance at dissection and. clinics is required, and a satisfactory 
examination in all branches taught in the college entitles the graduate to practise. In 
1881-’82 the faculty numbered 6 professors, 5 lecturers, and 1 demonstrator, with 45 
students and a graduating class of 34. 
The medical department of the University of Kansas City, organized in 1881, for 1882 
had 3 years of study and 2 fall lecture courses of 26 weeks each year, with clinical in- 
struction and practical anatomy. Candidates for degrees must undergo a full and satis- 
factory examination in each branch taught. There is a spring course for graduate stu- 
dents and others. The college faculty numbered 25 members, including a demonstrator 
of anatomy, with 25 students and 10 graduates. ’ 
Kansas City College Hospital of Medicine, organized in 1882, with a faculty of 11 pro- 
fessors, 2 lecturers, and 1 demonstrator, provided 2 courses of lectures of 20 weeks’ du- 
ration annually. A satisfactory examination was required at the end of the course on 
all branches taught in the college. 
In all the ‘‘regular”’? medical colleges of the State 628 matriculates and 250 gradu- 
ates were reported for 1881~’82; in the eclectic, 118 matriculates and 40 graduates.
-P-A-G-E-444
  150 REPORT OF THE ‘COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The College of Medical Practitioners, St. Louis, organized in 1882 to afford medical 
practitioners, graduates, and others an opportunity for reviewing medical studies and 
receiving additional practical instruction, holds 3 sessions of 5 weeks each annually 
and gives a diploma of associate membership to graduates of recognized and reputable 
medical schools who have attended a full course of lectures and the clinics of all the 
departments in the college, passed a satisfactory examination, and furnished satisfactory 
specimens of physiological or pathological work done by them. 
The American Medical College of St. Louis was the only recognized eclectic school in 
1882. The faculty embraced 10 professors and 1 adjunct professor, the students num- 
bering 118, with a graduating class of 40. A good elementary English education is 
required for admission, and for graduation 3 years of study, 2 courses of lectures of 20 
weeks each, and a satisfactory examination at the close. 
The Homeopathic Medical College of Missouri, for men only, was reorganized in 1882, 
taking the place of the St. Louis College of Homeopathic Physicians and Surgeons and 
the Hering Medical College. Credentials of suitable literary and scientific qualifications 
were required for admission, and for graduation 3 years of study and 2 full courses of lect- 
ures, of 19 weeks each, with a final and satisfactory examination. 
Dentistry was taught at the Missouri Dental College, St. Louis. A preliminary exam- 
ination in the English branches is required of all students who intend to take the full 
course. Although a 3-year graded course was announced for 1880-81, two full courses 
of lectures only were still offered, with clinical instruction by the demonstrator. Like 
instruction was given at the Kansas City Dental College in operative and mechanical den- 
tistry, covering 2 full courses of lectures, with a final examination for graduates. The 
Western College of Dental Surgery, St. Louis, in 1882 was suspended for the year. 
The St. Lowis College of Pharmacy in 1881-’82 required for a degree 2 years of instruc- 
tion, 2 courses of lectures of 20 weeks each, and a final examination. Candidates for 
graduation were also obliged to give satisfactory evidence of having served 4 years in the 
drug business. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Missouri Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Fulton, for 1882 
reported 12 instructors and 232 students, 94 being females. Instruction was givén in 
articulation and the ordinary English branches, and the average time spent in the insti- 
tution was 6 years. The employments taught were cabinet making, shoemaking, print- 
ing, and gardening. The grounds (100 acres) belonging to the institution, together with 
the buildings, are valued at $135,500. The State appropriated in 1882 $45,000 for the 
support of the institution. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
‘The Missouri School for the Blind, St. Louis, reported for 1881—’82 an enrolment of 90 
pupils who were receiving instruction in music and literature. The girls are instructed 
in machine knitting, sewing and fancy work, and all other work pertaining to the domes- 
tic department, and the boys in broom and brush making and in cane seating chairs. 
‘The State appropriated $52,000 for maintenance and salaries and $5,000 for repairs and 
refurnishing. 
‘The St. Louis School for Deaf-Mutes, under the control of the board of directors of the 
public schools, had 50 pupils, of whom 21 were girls. The studies are in 5 classes, all 
in the English branches. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Manual Training School of Washington University, St. Louis, had for 1882 a 
faculty of 10 members and 101 students. The course of study covers 3 years, and the 
students divide their working hours about equally between manual and mental exer- 
cises. Themental instruction included the English branches of high school study, and 
the manual a course of instruction in freehand, mechanical, and technical drawing, 
workshop training, and the study and management of steam. Before receiving a di- 
ploma each student has to construct a machine, which, with the drawings used, must 
remain in the school. 
HOMES FOR ORPHAN OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
_The St. Louis Protestant Orphan Asylum, Webster Groves, founded in 1835, in 1882 
instructed 67 children and supported 155. The 3 Roman Catholic schools of St. 
Louis (St. Mary’s Asylum, St. Bridget’s Half Orphan Asylum for Girls, and St. Joseph’s 
Asylum, for boys) had a total of 381 children. The boys over 9 years of age were taught 
farming and trades.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Missouri State Teachers’ Association held its meeting for 1882 at Brownsville, 
Jane 20-22, E. R. Booth presiding. The attendance was good, prominent educators from 
all partsof the Statebeingpresent. During the first day twoable addresses were delivered 
on the subject of ‘‘ Relation of public instruction to citizenship;’’ the other subjects for 
the day were ‘‘ Teachers as nonconductors”? and “‘ Natural sciences in public schools.’’ 
The exercises of the second day began with a paper setting forth the educational demands 
of the age, followed by an interesting paper by H. M. Hamil, entitled ‘‘ A comparison of 
Missouri with other States educationally.’’ The statistics furnished by him were not 
very flattering to Missouri and an animated discussion followed, after which the. fol- 
lowing subjects were discussed: The necessity for public education, county supervision, 
text books, teachers’ examinations, normal institutes, and schools. The subjects under 
consideration for the last day were ‘‘ Music in our schools,”” “‘ Wealth the product of 
intelligence and nature,’’ ‘Instinct and reason,’ ‘‘Literature in the public schools,” 
and ‘‘The teacher’s profession.’’? After the election of officers for the ensuing year an 
address was delivered by Mr. H. M. Hamil, the newly elected president, after which the 
association adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected by the people for 2 years, has 
general charge of the public schools, while a board of regents of the State University anda 
normal school board have control of the interests indicated by their titles. There is also 
a board composed of varic us State officers for the management of school lands and funds. 
Local school officers are county superintendents of public schools, elected by the peo- 
ple for 2 years, and dist-ict boards of 3 trustees, elected for 3 years. Districts having 
more than 150 youth of:chool age may, if a majority of voters so decide, elect boards of 
6 trustees. Women 21 -years old who are residents of the district and owners of property 
or haying children to ed icate may vote in district meetings.

OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all residents 5 to 21 years of age; and they must be taught 
at least 9 months of each year in districts having more than 200 pupils, 6 months in 
those having 75 to 200, and 3 months in those with less than 75. The funds for their 
support are derived from the income of a State common school fund, consisting of money, 
stocks, bonds, &c.; of such percentage as may be granted by Congress on the sale of 
lands in the State; of moneys arising from the sale or leasing of school lands; of the pro- 
ceeds of all lands granted to the State, unless for other purpose distinctly stated; and of 
the proceeds of escheats and forfeitures. In addition to the income of this fund there is 
for public schools a State school tax of not more than 1} mills on the dollar of taxable 
property, and taxes are voted by districts, which may not exceed 25 mills on the dollar. 
The income of the public schools is also augmented by various fines, licenses, &c. The 
State funds are apportioned by the State superintendent to the counties in proportion to 
school population, and by county superintendents to districts, three-fourths of the amount 
in proportion to the school population therein, the remaining one-fourth equally to the 
districts. Teachers must hold certificates of qualification and before receiving full pay 
must make monthly reports to the district director. The director reports annually to 
the county superintendent, the latter to the State superintendent, and he to the gov- 
ernor. Thesystem of education includes public high schools, teachers’ institutes, a State 
normal school, a State university, and a reformatory for children. Instruction in all 
schools supported or aided by public funds must be non-sectarian. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show 12,687 more youth of school age than during the previous year 
and 14,770 more enrolled in public schools, with a small increase in average daily attend- 
ance; 130 more school districts; 17 more with graded schools and 221 more with schools 
tauglit at least 6 months, the average term for the State being one day longer. Not so 
many houses were built as during the previous year, but the estimated value of school 
property increased by $180,415. More teachers were employed and the average monthly 
pay of men was $1 more, that of women $3.16 less. The increase in public school in- 
come and expenditure kept pace with that of the school population, the amount appor- 
tioned for each census child being about the same as during the previous year. A no- 
ticeable feature in the statistics is the large increase in the number of districts having 
more than 6 months’ school. Very few of the districts failing to sustain schools ascribe 
their failure to opposition on the part of the people. Some of them are too small and 
weak to maintain and still do not wish to give up their organization; others are willing 
to be annexed to neighboring districts, but are prevented by neighborhood quarrels. 
‘Whatever the causes may be, however, the number of districts without schools is grow- 
ing smaller. Although 269 new districts were organized during the last two years, there 
were 50 fewer in 1881-’82 than in 1879-’80 that did not maintain schools. The average 
length of term, too, is gradually increasing, being 2 days longer in 1881-’82 than in 
1879-80. 
Over 400 school-houses have been built during the two years, many of them without 
much regard to health, beauty, or comfort. The department has frequently been asked to 
furnish plans for school-houses, but has been unable to do so, and a small appropriation 
is asked for to pay for the publication and distribution of such plans. The question of 
school furniture has received more attention than formerly. 
The compensation of county superintendents was slowly increasing, but a majority 
were still very poorly paid, and as a consequence much inferior work was done. By the 
present law the compensation of superintendents is placed in the hands of county com- 
missioners, the minimum sum being $3 a day. The State superintendent recommends 
an amendment allowing a fixed salary, the amount of which shall be based on the num- 
ber of pupils in the county.

These are boards of education comprising, according to the law, at least 6 members in

  154 REPORT OF "RHE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The Lincoln public schools increase in enrolment at the rate of about 300 a year. An 
excellent school building with four rooms was erected during the year, similar to one 
built in 1881, the two costing about $20,000. A new course of study has been adopted, 
differing somewhat from the former one and embracing 4 classes below the high school 
department. All pupils take the same studies till they reach the last two years of the 
course, when a choice is offered them between 4 courses, including scientific and classical 
courses, which prepare for college. 
The school board of Omaha reports a rapid growth in the public schools since1880. The 
number of sittings increased from 2,800 to 3,500, but this enlargement scarcely kept pace 
with the rapidly increasing enrolment. Other buildings, however, nearly completed at 
date of the report, were expected to afford ample accommodations forall. Ten beautiful, 
convenient, and durable school-houses, containing 74 rooms, were owned by the board. 
'The revenue of the schools is ample, and under the present laws must continue to be more 
than enough. The amount derived from fines and licenses alone is sufficient to meet all 
ordinary expenses of the schools, and the rate of taxation is consequently very low. The 
course of study, which covers a period of 12 years, including the high school, was modern 
and progressive, and aimed to combine a practical education with the best possible 
culture. An evening school was taught during the winter, two teachers being employed. 
Aspecial teacher of elocution devoted four hours a week to this branch in the five higher 
grades. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE PROVISION FOR NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
The State Normal School, Peru, at one time prepared students for college and business 
as well as teaching, but it is now exclusively engaged in the préparation of teachers. 
There are two complete courses of study, an elementary of 2 yearsand ahigherof5. All 
the branches are pursued from a professional standpoint. Students in the elementary 
course are given a year’s drill in school economy, methods and practice of teaching, under 
askilled professional teacher; those who complete the higher course devote a year to the 
study of psychology, the science of education, and the art of teaching, all of which is 
reduced to practice in the school room. The year 1882 was the most prosperous one in 
the history of the institution. There were 318 students preparing to teach, representing 
37 counties of Nebraska and 6 other States; 45 were graduated, of whom 10 were from 
the higher course. 
The Chair of Didactics of the State University, organized in 1881, presents opportunity 
for electives in the junior and senior years, embracing the history of education, State 
and national systems, and school organization, management, and supervision. There 
were 21 students during the year, under a former State superintendent of instruction. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Santee Normal Training School, Santee agency, established by the American Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for the purpose of training preachers, teachers, 
interpreters, and business men and educating the women of the Dakota Nation, furnishes 
facilities for thorough instruction in the English language and science; physical training 
and industrial education are also being made prominent. Normal students in the last 
half of 1882 numbered 4. 
Training similar in character was given also at St. Paul’s Boarding School for Boys, 
Yankton Reserve, with 36 pupils, under 5 teachers; at St. Mary’s Boarding School for 
Girls, Santee Reserve, with 35 pupils, under 4 teachers ; at St. John’s Boarding School 
for Girls, Cheyenne River Reserve, with 34 pupils, under 3 teachers ; and at Hope School 
for Boys and Girls, Springfield, with 24 pupils, under 2 teachers. All these schools for 
Indian youth were under the supervision of the Protestant Episcopal bishop of Niobrara. 
How many of the pupils may be reckoned normal does not appear, but all are trained 
in school studies and as far as may be in useful industries with a view to elevating and 
civilizing their people. 
Professional instruction for teachers is also given at Doane College and Nebraska Wes- 
leyan University; at Nebraska Conference Seminary, York; in Hastings College, Hast- 
ings (organized in 1882 with preparatory and normal departments); and in the Blake 
School, Beatrice, a select preparatory and normal opened in 1881. Doane College pre- 
sents a course of 4 years designed to prepare students to be principals of common and 
high schools and school superintendents, special attention being given to the best 
methods of acquiring and imparting knowledge, to school organization and discipline, 
and to State laws concerning education. Nebraska Wesleyan University has a teachers’ 
course of 2 years, which includes all the branches required for a first grade certificate.

TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Two kinds of institutes for teachers are provided for by,law, one to be organized by 
the State superintendent and another by county superintendents. County institutes 
have been more successful and useful than the others, which have been generally at- 
tended only by the teachers of the counties in which they were held. For this reason 
none except county institutes were held during 1882, and the result was, as anticipated, 
a larger number of institutes and in many cases a larger attendance. ‘The work, how- 
ever, was hampered by a scarcity of good conductors and of funds. The State superin- 
tendent visited 31 counties, delivering lectures and talks to teachers, travelling about 
8,000 miles, and endeavoring to awaken popular interest and cause an increased appre- 
ciation of the benefits to be derived from good schools. Fifty institutes were held, with 
an enrolment of 2,251, an increase during the year of 9 institutes and 395 attending. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBIAC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Statistics of graded schools for 1882 were incomplete, only 28 districts reporting, whereas 
42 sent reports the previous year. These statistics show asmany as19 public high schools, 
with 991 pupils; the enrolment for 1881 was 1,458, 8 more schools reporting. The 
high school at Omaha, now having about 140 pupils, has grown rapidly during the last few 
years. That at Lincoln offers 4 different courses of study and fits for college. Courses of , 
4 years are also provided at Beatrice, Nebraska City, and Red Cloud}and of 3 years at 
Hastings, Grand Island, and Plattsmouth. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory schools, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and LX of the appendix, and 
corresponding summaries in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, has thus far established two of the five colleges 
contemplated in its organization, viz: a college of literature, science, and the arts, and 
anindustrial college, the latter embracing agriculture, practical science, civil engineering, 
and the mechanic arts. In the college of literature, science, and the arts are offered 
classical, literary, and scientific courses of study leading to the degree of bachelor of 
arts, of science, and of literature. During the first two college years the studies are pre- 
scribed, while those of the junior and senior years are largely elective. Drawing, paint- 
ing; music, modern languages, and didactics form a part of the course. 
. The other colleges are Doane College, Crete; Nebraska College, Nebraska City; Creigh- 
ton College, Omaha, and Nebraska Wesleyan University, Fullerton. Late catalogues 
received from three of these showed classical courses, which covered four years in all, ex- 
cept Creighton College (Roman Catholic), which presents a classical course of six years 
and a commercial course of four years, besides a preparatory course of two years. Ne- 
braska College sendsno late catalogue, but when last heard from its curriculum comprised 
classical, scientific, literary, and theological studies. Doane College provides also scien- 
tific, literary, and normal courses, and includes instruction in music, painting, and 
drawing. Nebraska Wesleyan University, besides its classical course, offers a scientific 
one of three years, a Latin-scientific of four, normal, commercial, and musical courses, 
instruction in painting, drawing, and wax work, and a non-resident course. The latter 
is intended to meet a want of professional men and women in the West who desire to 
complete a collegiate course or of those who have done so in fact but not in form. Both 
sexes are admitted to this as well as to the State University and to Doane College. 
1 Gifts amounting to over $16,000 were received during the year by Doane College and 
Nebraska Wesleyan University: $7,131 to the former, of which $6,000 was from Thomas 
Doane, of Charlestown, Mass., for endowment; and $9,000 to the Wesleyan University, 
from subscription of citizens, to be used for building and endowment. 
For statistics of these colleges, see Table LX of the appendix, and for a summary, see 
the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Brownell Hall, Omaha, a Protestant Episcopal institution, and the only one of colle- 
giate rank that is exclusively for girls in the State, had 33 students in its collegiate de- 
partment in 1881; it sends no statistics for 1882, \

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The chief provision for scientific study is found in the Industrial College of the State 
University, in which agriculture, horticulture, civil engineering, and related subjects 
are the leading studies.’- The courses are each, six years in length, including 2 of pre- 
paratory work. Students in engineering follow a course very nearly coincident during 
the first two years with the general scientific, while the junior and senior years are 
largely given to special studies in engineering and the higher mathematics. In the 
agriculttiral course prominence is given to the‘sciences in proportion to the directness of 
their relation to farming. Two or more agricultural or horticultural studies are pursued 
during each year. The couise in horticulture is intended to give familiarity with plant 
and tree culture. Students in the agricultural course may be required to labor 2 hours 
a day for &days in the week and are paid from 10 to 15 cents an hour. The farm con- 
tains 320 acres, with orchards, vineyards, stock, and other illustrative material. 
General courses in science are, as already noted, provided by the State University, 
Doane College, and Nebraska Wesleyan University, the last also offering a Latin scien- 
tific course. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Opportunities for theological instruction are found in the Nebraska Divinity School, 
Nebraska City (Protestant Episcopal), which reported 3 students in 1882, and in the Ne- 
braska Baptist Seminary, which was first opened for students in November, 1880. Thelat- 
ter reported in 1882 property worth $16,000, an endowment of $7,000, a good nucleus 
for a library, 6 teachers, and 111 students. 
No schools of Jaw report; but lectures in constitutional law formed a part of the course 
of study at the Nebraska Conference Seminary, York. The University of Nebraska pro- 
vided similar instruction. 
Medical studies are pursued at Omaha Medical College, Omaha, first opened in the fall 
of 1880, which reports 9 professors and 30 students during the year 1881-’82, of whom 
8 were graduated. The 3-year graded course of study is strongly recommended, but 
diplomas are granted to deserving students who have spent 3 years in study, including 2 
full courses of lectures, the last of them in this institution. Chemical laboratory work 
and a knowledge of medical botany are required. Candidates for admission must have 
a fair English education. Women are admitted on the same terms as men. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB, 
The Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, Omaha, gives free instruction to deaf- 
mute residents of the State 7 to 25 years of age who are of sound mind and free from 
contagious disease; also, to persons younger or older, at the discretion of the authorities. 
The aim is to give a good common school education, and especially a good command of 
the English language. The manual alphabet, the sign language, and articulation by 
means of Bell’s system of visible speech are all used. Some of the children were doing 
well in speech. During the year an oral class was taught for the purpose of cultivating 
hearing in those who retained the capacity to any extent, and of teaching speech by 
means of it, with the audiphone as an aid. Their progress was marked, and the class 
will be continued. Brinting, carpentry, needlework, and cookery are taught, and draw- 
ing and painting have been introduced toa limited extent. During the two years ending 
November 30, 1882, there were 120 pupils in the institute, and 94 at date of the report. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Nebraska Institution for the Blind, Nebraska City, reports steady and satisfactory 
growth during 1881 and 1882. ‘The average attendance increased from 21 to 25, and the 
efficiency of the different departments of the school was materially advanced. Reading, 
spelling, arithmetic, grammar, analysis, composition, rhetoric, history, physiology, al- 
. gebra, and geometry were taught, and the pupils, with scarcely an exception, received 
instruction in vocal or instrumental music or both. Two pianos and two organs were 
in constant use, two choirs met daily for vocal instruction, and considerable musical 
talent was being developed by the training given. The industrial department, which 
for several years has been self sustaining, received a fresh impetus in the last year. The 
brooms made here bring the highest market price and the cane-seating repairing of the 
city is done here.— The girls have given special. attention to various kinds of knitting 
and crocheting.

STATE REFORM SCHOOL.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the management of funds and for perfecting school organization there is a State 
board of education, consisting of the governor, State surveyor general, and State super- 
intendent of public instruction, the last acting as secretary of the board and exercising 
general supervision over the school system. For each county there is a superintendent 
of public schools, with a board of examiners; for each district a board of trustees of 3to 
5members, according to population.— (Laws of 1879.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The law provides for free schools for all youth 6-18. Schools are to be divided into 
Kindergiirten, primary, grammar, and high schools in those districtsin which the trust- 
   
-P-A-G-E-453
  
NEVADA. 159 
ees shall deem such grading advisable. The law requires all qualified children between 
8 and 14 to attend a public school at least 16 weeks in each school year, 8 of which shall 
be consecutive, unless otherwise taught. 
The schools are supported by the income from the State school fund and a tax of half 
a mill on the dollar, used only for the payment of teachers; an annual county tax of 15 to 
50 cents on $100, to be used at the discretion of local officers for the purchase of sites and 
furnishing of school buildings and libraries, for paying teachers, or for contingent ex- 
penses; when necessary, a district tax sufficientto raise an amount which, with the appro- 
priation for such district, will provide school 6 months. A special tax may also belevied 
by an affirmative vote of the district for extending the school term or furnishing addi- 
tional school facilities. The trustees of any district may levy rate bills of tuition for 
the payment of teachers in a school prolonged beyond the 6 months in which it is free to 
all. Twenty-five per cent. of the State and county funds are apportioned among the 
districts in proportion to the number of teachers assigned to each on the basis of 100 
census children or fraction thereof to a teacher; the remainder, to the several districts 
in the county in proportion to the number of children of school age. 
To be entitled to any part of the public school moneys, schools must be non-sectarian’ 
and must have been taught at least 3 months in the year by teachers duly examined, 
approved, and employed by legal authority; they must also have used the text books 
ordered by the State board of education. Teachers, to receive their pay, must have been 
legally employed, must hold in full force and effect a certificate from the State or county 
board of examiners, and must have made full reports asrequired bylaw. No discrim- 
ination in the salaries of teachers is allowed on account of sex. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
A comparison with the previous year shows that, while there were more districts, more 
public schools (both graded and ungraded) and more without rate bills, an increased school 
term, more teachers at better pay, higher receipts and expenditures, and a larger State 
school fund, there was nevertheless a considerable falling off in the value of school 
property and a slight decrease in school population, enrolment, and average attendance. 
The State superintendent, in his report for 1881 and 1882, states that, while in some 
schools there was an advanced and healthy educational condition, in many others he 
found it quite otherwise; that his efforts to secure the new legislation needed to remedy 
existing defects in the school system were unavailing; that the State superintendent is 
really invested with no authority, no one being amenable to him, the most conspicuous 
duty required of him being to visit schools; and that the State board of education has 
really little to do with the public schools except to take charge of the public school 
moneys. While thus pointing out the defects of the school law, the superintendent is 
nevertheless struck with the attachment the people of the State have shown for the 
schools in the face of adverse circumstances, and with an improved school law he is 
hopeful of the future. 
The Pacific School Journal of December, 1882, says that Nevada treats her teachers 
with great liberality, paying the highest salaries of any State in the Union;! moreover 
by paying men and women alike for equal services the State secures some of the ablest 
teachers on the Pacific coast. The Carson City schools, it is said, were not inferior 
to the best in California; a model school at Gold Hill was an honor to the city and to th 
teachers who had made it what it was. . 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Although the law provides for Kindergirten in connection with the public schools, 
there seems to have been but one established. A Kindergarten department at Carson 
City was reported in 1881, but for 1882 there is no information from this, nor are any 
others known to exist in the State. S 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF VIRGINIA CITY, 
OFFICERS. 
Each village, town, or corporate city forms one district, the schools of which are un- 
der the control of a board of trustees, which in cities of 1,500 or more registered voters 
must consist of 5 members, and of 3 in smaller towns. 
STATISTICS. 
Virginia City, with a population of 10,917, had in 1882 a school population of 2,207, 
an enrolment of 1,854, an average daily attendance of 1,201, with 27 teachers, and an 
expenditure of $34,203. The schools were taught 204 days, in 4 buildings, 1 for the

work are made in scrip worth only 40 cents on the dollar,

primary grade, with 17 rooms; 2 for grammar, with 10 rooms, and 1 for the high school, 
with 3 rooms, the entire school property being valued at $35,575. There was an esti- 
mated enrolment of 342 in private and parochial schools. Compared with 1880 there 
was a decrease of 352 in school population, of 406 in enrolment, of 75 in average daily 
attendance, of 5 in teachers, and a shrinkage of $35,925 in the value of school property. 
Nevertheless, the figures for 1882 indicate a satisfactory state of things as to attendance, 
the enrolment in the public schools being 84 per cent. of. school population, and assuming 
the children in private and parochial schools to be of schgol age it would appear that 99.5 
per cent. of such youth were in school.— (Return. )

8 professors and instructors, 70 students (26 being in the preparatory, 34 in the collegiate 
department, and 10 in special and partial courses), a 4-year full course of studies, a scho- 
lastic year of 40 weeks, and a library of 280 volumes.— (Return.) 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The State provides for the instruction of its deaf-mutes and blind youth at the school 
at Berkeley, Cal. The State superintendent reported but one deaf-mute remaining from 
Nevada in 1882. He reports but 7 deaf-mutes and 5 blind of all ages in the State, and 
speaks of the school at Berkeley as an excellent one, where the pupils, brought up to 
fill places of usefulness and respectability, are so educated as to suffer the least possible 
embarrassment from their affliction.— (State report.) 
There is no indication of any provision for the feeble-minded. The need of areforma- 
tory school is referred to in the State report. 
TRAINING OF ORPHANS. 
The State Orphans’ Home, Carson City, in its biennial report shows an enrolment of 
71 inmates in 1881 and of 57 in 1882. During these 2 years 40 had been discharged, 8 
indentured, and 1 had run away. Since its foundation (in 1864) 297 had been sent to 
the home, 204 discharged, 46 indentured, and 4 had died, leaving 48 remaining December 
31, 1882. Instruction is given in the elementary English branches and in vocal music, 
with evening sessions devoted to moral and religious instruction. The children partici- 
pate in all the festivals and national holidays and have a picnic each summer, all the 
expenses, including Christmas presents, being provided for by the children’s gift fund. 
There was a library of 760 volumes, and for the 2 years a State appropriation of 
$32,500.— (Biennial report, 1881 and 1882.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the State, a superintendent of public instruction, a board of commissioners of the 
literary fund, and a board of trustees for the State Normal School ; for towns, school com- 
mittees, and a superintendent of schools in any town which may so elect; for districts, a 
moderator, a clerk, and a prudential committee. Districts comprising the whole town 
must and other districts may elect a board of education. Women vote in school meet- 
ings and are eligible to all school offices.— (Laws, 1878, 1879, 1881.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained mainly from a town tax on polls and ratable estate ot 
$350 for every dollar in the $1,000 of State tax which such towns are required to raise 
for general purposes; they may raise a larger sum than this, to be assessed in the same 
way. A literary fund, arising from a tax on the capital stock of banking corporations and 
from a tax on savings bank deposits, slightly increases a small permanent school fund 
derived from the proceeds of the sales of public lands, and the proceeds of sales of State 
lands augment the school fund, though not largely. 
The public schools are free to all resident children of school age; and all 8 to 14 are 
required by law to attend a public or private school or receive instruction at home at least 
11E ’

  162 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
12 weeks in every year, 6 of which, in the case of a public school pupil, must be consecu- 
tive. No child under 16 years of age may be employed in any manufacturing establish- 
mentunless he has attended school 12 weeks of the preceding year; none under 14 unless he 
has attended 6 months or the full term of the school taught in his district the preceding 
year; none under 12 who has not attended during the whole term; none under 16, 
Bar in vacation, who cannot read and write; and none under 10 may be so employed. 
at all. 
The owner or agent of a manufactory employing a child under 16 years of age and 
uncertified by the school committee as eligible to be employed becomes liable to a fine 
not exceeding $20 for each offence. Parents or others having the control of children 
8 to 14 violating the Jaw are to forfeit $10 for the first and $20 for every subsequent 
offence. ‘Towns may make by-laws concerning habitual truants and children 6:to 16 
years of age not attending school, and require their attendance under apenalty of $10 for 
each offence or a sentence of 1 year in the State Reform School, and such towns may 
appoint 3 or more officers to enforce these laws. Teachers to be employed and entitled 
to receive their pay must present to the prudential committee a certificate of qualifica- 
tion from the school committee of the town in which the school is to be taught, nor 
is any teacher to receive payment for services unless a certificate of the school commit- 
tee of the town that the required register of the school has been duly returned is deliv- 
ered to the prudential committee.— (School law. ) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics for 1882 show improvement on the previous year. There was 4 small 
increase in the enrolment, in the average daily attendance, in the number in private 
schools, in the number of school-houses, and in those having maps and globes, and in 
youth out of school there was a decrease, as well as in school-houses unfit for use. With 
these gains, there was a decrease in common, graded, and high schools. There were 
fewer male and more female teachers, making a net gain of 9 teachers. There were 
fewer teaching successive terms and more from normal schools, with an advance in 
average pay, especially for men. In income and expenditures there was a slight gain. 
The State superintendent says that many of the schools are extremely good but some 
deplorably bad. Some cities and towns have shown an enlightened liberality in the 
erection and furnishing of school buildings; others have manifested precisely oppo- 
site tendencies. ‘The scholarship of many of the teachers, he says, is too limited and 
inaccurate. The mostserious problem, he thinks, is in the agricultural districts, which 
are suffering constant depletion of school population from the inclination of youths to 
seek employment in manufacturing and business centres. Of the 2,644 public schoolsin 
the State, 753 enrolled 12 or under 12 scholars, and 310, 6 or under 6.—(State report.) 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Towns and cities have school committees or boards of education for the control of pub- 
lie schools and may appoint asuperintendent. Concord, although without a municipal 
school system, has a superintendent and a board of education, consisting of 8 members, for 
aunion school district embracing most of the city, and superintending school committees 
forthe other districts ; Dover, under a new charter, has a school committee of 2 elected 
in each ward and 4 by the city council at large, instead of a former board of education; 
Manchester has a school committee of 2 from each ward, instead of 1, as heretofore 
reported, and a superintendent of public instruction; Nashua, a board of education and 
a superintendent of schools; and Portsmouth, a board of instruction.— (State and city 
reports. )

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. ‘ 
Concord for 1881-’82 reports 55 public schools, 53 having maps and globes. There was 
an increase of 176 in enrolment, of 195 in average daily attendance, and of 14 in teachers. 
There were 30 school-houses, valued, with other school property, at $183,352, an advance 
of $17,900 on 1881. Of the 87 teachers employed 3 were teaching for the first time, 48 
had taught the same school for more than 1 term, and 12 were from normal schools. Of 
the 55 schools, 39 were graded. 
In the city of Concord, after the primary, intermediate, and grammar courses, there was 
a high school department, with an English course of 3 years and academic and classical 
courses of 4 years each. The mixed school, heretofore introduced as an experiment to give 
instruction in special studies to those who could attend only part of the year, was con- 
tinued during the winter term with increased attendance. 
Instruction in music and drawing was given in all these schools. The superintending 
committee speak of the school year as having been, in the main, one of order and pros- 
perity.— (State and city reports. ) 
Dover reports but one legally organized school district, with 41 different public schools, 
all having maps and globes; of these, 32 were graded schools and 1a high school. There 
were 18 school-houses, valued, with other school property, at $141,100. In school popu- 
lation there was a loss of 270, teachers, enrolment, and average daily attendance remain- 
ing stationary. The schools reported 7I per cent. of the enrolment in average daily 
attendance. An evening school was open 12 weeks, averaging 85 pupils a night. The 
superintendent speaks of the schools as well graded and taught by efficient teachers, but 
reports the school-houses as needing extensive repairs and alterations.— (City report.) 
Manchester, comprising one school district, for 1882 reported 75 different schools, classed 
as primary, middle, grammar, and high, the last having an English and French, a 
classical, and a college preparatory course, of 4 years each, and graduating 53. There 
were evening schools, with an average of 14 teachers and 164 pupils. The training 
school, opened the previous year, was thought to be adapted to its object. There were 
24 school-houses, with 3,645 sittings, valued, with other school property, at$310,075. The 
work of the truant officer had nearly extinguished truancy in its worst forms and re- 
duced the ratio of absenteeism 6 per cent. during the year. The estimated enrolment in 
private and parochial schools was 3,200, with an average attendance of 2,178, of whom 
1,475 were Irish, 657 French, and 46 Americans. This large number issaid to be owing 
to the extensive system of Roman Catholic parochial schools. As compared with 1881, 
city schools showed a decrease of 11 in teachers, of 255 in enrolment, of 106 in average 
daily attendance, and an increase of $1,657 in expenditures and $23,875 in the value of 
school property. In a general survey of their school system and its results, the school 
committee say it is gratifying to make so favorable a report, the city having a zealous su- 
perintendent, intelligent and faithful teachers, and a system of classification and studies 
at once elaborate and exacting.— (State and city reports and city return.) 
Nashua, constituting 1 school district, had 17 school-houses, valued, with other school 
property, at $236,891, and 54 public schools, 51 having maps and globes. The schools 
are classed as high, grammar, middle, and primary, the first two each having 4-year courses, 
middle grade, 2 years; primary, 3. A special teacher of music gave instruction to the 
primary, middle, and grammar schools. Evening schools had an attendance of 346, under 
17 teachers. As compared with 1881, there was a gain of 149 in enrolment and 3 in 
teachers, and a loss of 110 in average daily attendance, while expenditure increased 
$1,529 and the value of school property remained the samé.— (State and city reports. 
Portsmouth for 1882 reported 1 school district, with 14 school-houses, valued, with other 
school property, at $82,600, and 32 public schools, all having maps and globes. The 
schools were classed as high, grammar, intermediate, and primary. The estimated en- 
rolment in private and parochial schools was 150. There was a decrease of 12 in school 
population, of 481 in average daily attendance, and of $2,051 in expenditures. The 
public schools enrolled 85 per cent. of the school population, and adding the 150 in pri- 
vate and parochial schools 91 per cent. of it were under instruction.— (State and city 
reports and city return.) 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, 
The New Hampshire State Normal School, Plymouth, in 1882 received a State appro- 
priation of $6,750 and one of, $1,200 from the city. There were 3 resident and 1 non- 
resident instructors, with 2 male and 49 female normal students, 10 of whom graduated 
and engaged in teaching. The full course of study requires 2 years. A certificate is 
given on the completion of the studies of the first year and a full diploma on the com- 
pletion of the course. A training school is made up of 100 children, corresponding to the 
5 lower grades in a city school. ‘These are graded in groups of 10, each pupil teacher

having a class for 10 weeks and then being transferred to another class. For admission to the normal school, males must be 17 and females 16 years of age; all must declare 
their intention to fit themselves to teach. The State superintendent remarks that the 
State, which supports no institutes and only 1 normal school, is doing little for the im- 
provement of its teachers. The attendance on the normal school he says should be twice 
what it is, no institution in the country being more professional or doing more thorough 
work. Large numbers are said to go to other States for normal instruction.— (State 
and city reports and city return.)   
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
There being no provision by the State for institutes, the teachers maintain their vol- 
untary organizations and support their yearly meetings at their own expense. The 
State superintendent justly remarks that it does not seem honorable to throw the expense 
of these institutes upon the poorly paid teachers. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL, 
There being no educational journal published in this State, information as to its pub- 
lie schools is given in the National Journal of Education, Boston, which has a New 
Hampshire department. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
By law, any town, by a majority vote, or any district having not less than 100 youth 
6-16, by a two-thirds vote, may becomea high school district and establish a high school. 
In answer to acircular sent out by the State authorities to all the high school districts 
in the State, some districts failing to report and so accounting for the decrease from last 
year, only 40 high schools reported for 1882 as against 60 in 1881. This numberincludes 
the State Normal School and the Littleton graded school, the latter probably having 
some properly high school studies. In the 40 schools reported there were 36 male and 
61 female teachers, with 1,240 male and 1,648 female students, 1,911 pursuing the higher 
branches and 1,042 ancient and 329 modern languages. School property was valued at 
$717,575.— (State report. ) 
PRIVATE SECONDARY SCIIOOLS. 
The statistics of 53 of these schools reported for 1882 show 94 male and 67 female 
teachers, with 1,893 boys and 1,223 girls in attendance; 924 studied ancient and 545 
modern languages.— (State report.) 
For other statistics of such schools reporting, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of-the 
appendix, and for summaries of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE. 
Dartmouth College, Hanover, the only institution in the State for superior instruc- 
tion, reported in 1882 no changes from 1881. Its departments are academic, scientific, 
agricultural, and medical, for which last three, see Scientific and Professional Instruction, 
below. The collegiate standard is high, necessitating an advanced standard of ad- 
mission, that the college courses may be properly pursued. Graduates of such prepara- 
tory schools as have a thorough preparation for college of at least 3 years are admitted 
without examination on the certificates of their principals that they have mastered the 
entire requisites for admission, the first three months of the freshman year being pro- 
bationary, when those proving unfit to go on are dropped. The academic department 
has a 4-year classical course, with modern languages, mathematics, &c. After 1882 a 
course in elective studies for the junior and senior years will be provided. This depart- 
ment includes a Latin-scientific course, differing from the full classical course only inthe 
omission of Greek and the substitution of an additional amount of mathematics, sci- 
ences, and modern languages.— (Catalogue. ) 
For statistics of this department, see Table IX of the appendix. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of these institutions reporting, see Table VIII of the appendix; for sum- 
maries of them, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Hanover, aims to give 
that practical education to the industrial classes which is needed in active life. Com- 
mencing with 1882-’83 the previous 3-year course will be changed to one of 4, with nu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-459
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 165 
merous optional studies well adapted to the wants of students who desire a prepa- 
ration for active life. The college is reported to be in successful operation. Besides a 
library of about 2,000 volumes of scientific works, a museum of general and applied 
science, and a chemical laboratory, the college is provided with instruments for practical 
surveying, the students having the benefit of the philosophical apparatus of Dartmouth 
College.— (Catalogue. ) 
The Chandler Scientific Department of Dartmouth College in 1881—’82 had 48 students in 
its 4-year course, and offered an additional year for resident graduates. The course is 
characterized by a practical scientific tendency and the study of belles lettres through 
the medium of French and German and by discussions and themes in English. The 
preparatory studies required are those pursued in the common schools of New England. 
The Thayer School of Civil Engineering, another department of the college, had 7 students 
in its 2-year course. This is not only strictly a professional course, but it is essentially 
a graduate course, though open to any young man of sufficient maturity of mind and 
mathematical knowledge to satisfy the requirements for admission, which embrace, 
among other things, a rigid examination in the higher mathematics. 
For further information as to these departments, see Table X of the appendix. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No schools of theology or law in New Hampshire are known to this Bureau. 
Medical.—The medical department of Dartmouth College in 1882 had 8 professors and 
5 lecturers, with 96 students. Applicants for admission must be 18 years of age and, 
unless matriculates of some regular medical college or graduates of somerespectable col- 
lege, academy, or high school, must be examined as to their fitness to enter upon the 
study of medicine. For gradpation, 2 full courses of lectures, 3 years of professional 
study undera regular practitioner, evidence of practice in dissection, and a dissertation on 
some medical subject are required. Besides the regular lectures, there is instruction by 
daily recitations from December to June. 
For further particulars, see Table XIII of the appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
New Hampshire provides for the instruction of its deaf-mutes in the Clarke Institu- 
tion, Northampton, Mass., and in the American Asylum for the Education of the Deaf 
and Dumb, Hartford, Conn., the former of which had 1 pupil, the latter 21, from this 
State in 1882. The blind are taught in the Perkins Institution, Boston, which, while 
not noting the number of New Hampshire pupils in 1882, shows receipts of $3,620 for 
blind pupils from the State. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The State Industrial School, Manchester, had instructed 1,100 inmates since its estab- 
lishment, and had 111 in 1882, 13 of whom went out on the expiration of their sentences, 
11 went to homes provided for them, and 9 were honorably discharged. 
In school all are taught the common English branches; out of school the boys work at 
farming, gardening, chair seating, and shoemaking. Of those discharged 75 per cent. 
are known to have become orderly and useful citizens.— (Return. ) 
TRAINING OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
The institutions for this work are the Orphans’ Home, Concord, under Protestant Epis- 
copal influence; the New Hampshire Orphans’ Home, Franklin, a private and non-secta- 
rian institution supported by voluntary contributions; and the Children’s Home, Ports- 
mouth, which receives orphan, motherless, or otherwise homeless children under 12 years 
of age, and trains them, without distinction of creed or color, in practical home duties 
and habits of honesty, truthfulness, purity, and industry, with literary instruction inthe 
public schools. Statistics for all these are wanting for 1882. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-ninth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Con- 
cord, October 20-21, 1882, there being present 300 teachers. Superintendent William 
E. Buck opened the session with a paper on ‘‘Supplementary reading,” giving a list of 
books which he regarded as safe and profitable reading for youth. Prof. E. H. Barlow, 
principal of the Tilden Seminary, West Lebanon, then read a paper on ‘‘A few things 
worth looking at.’? He held that the public school system is not meeting the wants 
of the boys and girls: the intellect is trained at the expense of the feelings and will; 
skill at handicrafts is not provided for; manual dexterity should be taught in all the  
-P-A-G-E-460
  166 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schools. ‘‘Shall the State be asked to reéstablish the county institute? ’’ was answered 
in the affirmative hy Professor Quimhy, principal of the New Hampshire Conference 
Seminary, Tilden, who was indorsed by Principal Ham, of Farmington, as express- 
ing the opinion of the entire association. Principal W. A. Robinson, of Franklin, then 
read a paper on “‘ The town vs. the district system,’’ advocating the former and giving 
a history of the beneficial effects of the change in Franklin. Next came a discussion 
on ‘The present situation and the future of our schools,’? opened by Colonel Parker, 
who was followed hy Hon. J. W. Patterson, contrasting the school systems of the past 
and present and predicting what the system of the future will be. The second day’s 
session was opened by the consideration of committee reports and the presentation of 
the resolutions adopted by the Concord Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. These 
resolutions, urging the association to recommend the introduction into the schools of 
scientific instruction as to the physiological effects of alcohol, were favorably received, 
“Language in grammar and high schools’’ was discussed by Principal Powers, of Nashua, 
Profs. J. K. Lord and Pollens, of Dartmouth College, Bailey, of Keene, and Parker, of 
Boston, some favoring and others opposing technical grammar. The discussion was con- 
tinued by a paper on ‘‘ Language in the primary schools,” from Miss Sprague, principal 
of the Manchester Training School for Teachers, who offered practical suggestions in re- 
gard to the teaching of language in all schools below the grammar grades. The closing 
paper was on ‘‘The high school,”’ by Prof. A. S. Hardy, of Dartmouth College, which, 
on account of its excellence, was to be incorporated in the State superintendent’s report. 
The officers for the ensuing year were then elected, and thus closed, it is said, one of the 
most interesting, instructive, and enthusiastic meetings the association ever held.—

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The general supervision of the public school system is committed by law to a State 
board of education, which board elects by ballot every third year a superintendent of 
public instruction for the State and appoints a superintendent of public schools for each 
county, the latter subject to the approval of the board of freeholdersin the county. For 
ordinary school districts (which must contain at least 75 children of school age) the 
county superintendent may appoint 3 trustees at the laying out of the district, the resi- 
dent voters may elect these or others at the first annual district meeting, and annually 
thereafter these voters elect one in place of one of the 3 thus first chosen. The district 
trustees constitute a township board of trustees for each township, and as such meet the 
e

county superintendent semiannually for consultation as to the management of schools. 
‘Women residing in a district are eligible to the oftice of district trustee in it, if over 21 
years of age and able to read and write, which qualifications are required of men also. 
City and town districts (every incorporated city or town constituting but one school dis- 
trict) have elective school boards, boards of education, or boards of school trustees, ac- 
cording to their several charters, the members usually liable to partial annual change. 
Each district board has a clerk or secretary to record its proceedings, keep accounts, and 
take an annual census of school children. Besides the above mentioned, there are boards 
of examination to test the qualifications of applicants for teachers’ certificates. These 
certificates entitle their holders to teach either in any part of the State or in any county 
or city by the examining authorities of which the certificate is issued. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM, 
The public schools are free to all resident children 5 to 18 years of age, regardless of 
religion, nationality, or color. They are supported by the proceeds of a State school fund, 
by a State tax equal to $4 for each child of school age, and by additional amounts raised 
through township taxation. Each district is entitled to at least $200 of the school fund, 
and districts with 45 or more children get not less than $350, to be apportioned by 
county superintendents. To secure this aid, districts must provide suitable school build- 
ings and must have maintained a public school for at least 9 months during the preced- 
ing school year. To entitle themselves to pay, teachers must hold certificates of quali- 
fication and present a duly kept register for the time for which pay is asked. Teachers 
may suspend pupils from school for se, but may not administer corporal punishment. 
The State allows an annual appropriation of $100 for each county teachers’ institute and 
teachers are required to attend the institute held in the county in which they teach. 
No portion of any school fund may be used for the support of sectarian schools. The 
county and city superintendents together constitute ‘‘The State Association of School 
Superintendents’? and meet annually, as the State board of education may direct. The 
State offers to any city, town, or township that will raise not less than $3,000 a like sum 
for the establishment of schools for the traininggof pupils in industrial and mechanical 
pursuits, and afterwards an annual contribution €qual to that contributed in said locality, 
not to exceed $5,000. The State also encourages district libraries by giving $20 to any 
public school which has raised a like amount, with an annual sum of $10 if the district 
shall have given the same.    
    
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statements of Superintendent Apgar for 188i—’82 indicate a condition of school af- 
fairs not materially different from that reported in the preceding year. The percentages 
of enrolment in public schools and of attendance on both public and private schools were 
about the same. Against 8,266 additional youth of school age there appears an enrol- 
ment of 5,984 more in public schools and of 904 more in private schools, so that on the 
whole there were 6,888 more youths under instruction, 2,142 more than in the preceding 
year being reported as not in school. The number of public school buildings is reported 
as 8 less, but the sittings for pupils were 2,735 more. Private and church schools di- 
minished apparently by 36. Notwithstanding a diminution of expenditure for public 
schools, the time during which the schools were taught was on an average 2 days greater 
for the State. The quality of the teaching force seems on the whole to have improved, 
the number of teachers holding State certificates, which imply a high grade of qualifica- 
tion, being 42 greater, the number holding city certificates being 80 more, and the first 
grade county certificates 33 more, making a total of 155 more teachers that may reason- 
ably be considered well qualified. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
Free evening schools were held in 8 cities during 1881-’82, with a total enrolment of 
5,681, an increase of 805, the average evening attendarice being 2,456, an increase of 450. 
The number of teachers rose from 104 to 116, their average salary being $7.43 a week. 
The total amount appropriated for evening schools was $8,954.

For information of schools of this class, see Table V of the appendix; for a summary of 
their statistics, see a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
The school interests of each city or town are under the control of school boards, boards 
of education, or boards of school trustees, elected by the people. A city superintendent 
is usually the executive officer, and such persons as the board may appoint constitute a 
city board of examiners.

increase in average enrolment was 400, in average attendance 291. Only 61 pupils were 
over 18 years of age, and 35 of these were in the city normal school preparing to become 
teachers. Five evening schools, one of them an evening drawing school, had an attend- 
ance of 1,646 pupils. ‘These, with the day pupils, made a total of 21,405 under instruc- 
tion in the city schools, adding to which 6,000 in private or church schools, it appears 
that out of the 41,498 children of school age 27,405 were under some school training

  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NEW JERSEY STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, TRENTON. 
This school is under the management of a board composed of 14 trustees and the State 
superintendent, During the school year there were 233 pupils enrolled, the average 
attendance being 186. The total number was 3 less than the preceding year, but the 
average attendance was 5 more. The elementary course covers 2 years, and students, 
to enter the advanced course, must be familiar with the first year of the elementary 
course. Instruction was given in elocution, calisthenics, vocal music, drawing, and 
penmanship throughout both courses. There were 39 graduates in 1882, of whom 25 
graduated from the advanced course ; all the graduates engaged in teaching, 
Graduates of the school (who comprise about 11 per cent. of all the teachers in the 
State) are permitted to teach without further examination. Theschool receives $20,000 
annually from the State. A model school connected with the institution had an enrol- 
ment of 420 pupils, under 24 instructors. It furnishes students of the normal school an 
opportunity for observation and practice teaching ; its course of study is graded from ele- 
mentary English through high school studies, and boys may be thoroughly prepared in 
it for any class in college. 
FARNUM PREPARATORY SCHOOL, BEVERLY. 
This institution receives aid from the State, acts in conjunction with the normal school 
in preparing teachers for the public schools, and its graduates are received into the senior 
class of the advanced course of the State normal school. Its departments are primary, 
intermediate, preparatory, and senior. Instruction is given in music, drawing, and paint- 
ing, French, and German, and pupils are prepared for business or college, The average 
attendance during the year was 114. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Newark Normal School was established in 1879 to prepare teachers for that city. 
Its course of study covers a year, only graduates from.the high school being admitted.
-P-A-G-E-465
  NEW JERSEY. 171 
The special studies are mental and moral philosophy, theory and practice of teaching, 
and critical readings in English literature. The students spend two weeks or more in 
teaching in the city training school, 3 classes in this school being taught by them en- 
tirely. Resident instructors, 8; normal pupils in 1881-’82, 28, of whom 26 engaged in 
teaching. Three educational journals were taken, drawing and vocal music were taught, 
and there was a collection of casts, models, and other apparatus. 
At Hoboken, the normal class heretofore noticed was continued on every Saturday 
forenoon during the school session. Fifteen graduates received certificates or diplomas. 
Instruction was given in the studies required for each grade, supplemented by ideas on 
teaching, plans for organizing schools, and methods of discipline. The registration for 
the year was 59; the average attendance, 41. The city teachers, forming a society for 
mutual improvement, met once a month for the discussion of topics connected with 
their work. 
Jersey City continued the instruction given in former years in its high school to pupils 
that desired to prepare for teaching, and the report of the superintendent indicates that 
the number of such was 74 for the year. A training school connected with the high 
school gives opportunity for practice teaching. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
  During the year county teachers’ institutes were held in the counties of Bergen, Cum- 
berland, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Salem, 
Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren. 
At Mount Holly, Burlington County, where many teachers have for several years met 
the county superintendent, Mr. Edgar Haas, monthly, in a voluntary institute, for sys- 
tematic studies of an advanced character, an elementary course in English grammar, 
reading, arithmetic, and practical mensuration was pursued in 1881-’82. A similar 
association of teachers at Burlington, composed wholly of men, is reported by Superin- 
tendent H aas as haying done superior work. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The State report gives no definite information in regard to high schools in the State. 
In Elizabeth they were conducted in 3 buildings by 9 teachers, with an average daily at- 
tendance of 118, and in Jersey City High School 569 pupils were enrolled, with an attend- 
ance of 429 and 87 in the graduating class. High schools were also noted in Hoboken, 
Millville, Newark, New Brunswick, Orange, Paterson, Phillipsburg, and Plainfield, 
while there were high school departments also in the State Normal School, Trenton, in 
the city school system of the same place, and in the Farnum Preparatory School, Beverly,

. paratory to college, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for summaries of the 
same, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR MEN, 
The College of New Jersey, Princeton (Presbyterian), in 1882 (the one hundred and 
thirty-sixth year of its existence), maintained its classical, scientific, and elective courses 
of former years, with a faculty of 37 members and an enrolment of 541 students. Of 
these 9 were fellows and 54 graduate and 18 special students. Regular courses of study 
occupy 4 years. The entrance, promotion, and graduation of students were determined 
by examination, and the degree of bachelor of arts was conferred only upon students 
who passed a satisfactory final examination. Thorough graduate courses in biology and 
palaontology have been established, open to graduates of this and other colleges and 
leading to corresponding degrees, Attached to the diplomas issued to students in these 
courses is to be a statement that the degree has been awarded for proficiency in the above 
sciences, Any candidates for a degree who pass a satisfactory examination may com- 
pete for prizes, scholarships, and fellowships offered in the classes or departments with 
which they are connected. Biblical instruction is given each week by the president and 
3 professors. 
Rutgers College, New Brunswick, in the one hundred and twelfth year of its exist- 
ence, reported for 1882 classical, scientific, special, and graduate courses, with a faculty 
of 15 members and 134 students, 15 of them graduates. The courses for graduation 
as bachelor of arts and bachelor of science cover 4 years. For higher degrees there are  
-P-A-G-E-466
  
172 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
graduate courses covering 2 to 5 years. French, German, Greek, and Latin enter into 
the regular A. B. course and Hebrew is offered as an extra study during the senior year 
for students intending to enter the ministry. 
St. Benedict’s College, Newark, and Seton Hail College, South Orange (both Roman Cath- 
olic), reported for 1881-’82 preparatory departments and classical and commercial courses 
of study; the former had 68 students, and the latter 100. The preparatory department 
at St. Benedict’s embraces only elementary English studies. The standard at Seton 
Hall has been raised. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
For statistics of schools of this class reporting for 1881, see Table VIII of the appendix, 
and a summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Rutgers Scientific School (constituted by act of the legislature the State College of 
Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts) presented for 1881-82 full 4-year courses of instruc- 
tion in civil engineering and mechanics, in chemistry and agriculture, and special courses 
in chemistry and agriculture covering 2 years, each 4-year course leading to its corre- 
sponding degree, while certificates alone are given to those students who pursue to their 
completion the special 2-year courses. ‘ 
The John C. Green School of Science, connected with: the College of New Jersey, Prince- 
ton, had 2 courses in general science: one of 4 years, leading to the degree of B. s.; the 
other, a course of at least a year in special departments of science for students who have 
received the first degree and are candidates for the degree of M. s. Students in the 
junior year desiring to devote to certain branches more than the usual time may elect 
one of 3 courses, which are in (1) mathematics and mechanics, (2) biology and geology, 
(3) chemistry and mineralogy. The course need not be selected before the close of the 
first term in the junior year. There is also a select course in physics that may be taken 
in the senior year by students that have chosen mathematics and mechanics. Then in 
the Green school there is a 4-year course in civil engineering, which for the first 3 years 
is the same for all, but in the fourth year may be varied by students showing marked 
advance in special branches of engineering. A course of 2 to 4 months, according to the 
preparation of the student, is provided for graduates of the school and special students 
intending to study medicine. 
Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, a school of mechanical engineering, offered in 
1881-82 a full 4-year course, each year divided into 4 terms, the first or preliminary 
term being devoted to experimental mechanics and shop work. The courses of instruction 
include mathematics, mechanical engineering and drawing, physics, chemistry, languages, 
and belles lettres. Admission, promotions, and graduation depend on the passage of ex- 
aminations. 
For statistics of these scientific schools, see Table X of the appendix, and a summary 
of the same in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. A 
Theology is the only professional training reported in 1882. The schools for it were 
the Theological Seminary, Princeton, the German Theological School of Newark, N. J. 
Bloomfield (both Presbyterian), Drew Theological Seminary, Madison (Methodist Epi 
copal), the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church in America, New Bru 
wick, and the Diocesan Seminary of Seton Hall College, South Orange (Roman Cath- 
olic). The first 4had full 3-year courses, with preliminary examinations for all who 
were not college graduates; the German Theological School had a 3-year preparatory 
course, and the instruction in theology at Seton Hall College was not separated from that 
of the collegiate course. : 
For statistics of theological schools, see Table XI of this volume. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF DEAF-MUTES AND OF THE BLIND AND FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The number of deaf-mutes educated by the State in special schools of other States was 
156, number of blind 57, and of feeble-minded 41, and the cost to the State of such 
instruction was $69,616.    
  REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The New Jersey State Reform School, for boys, Jamesburg, reported for 1882 the number 
of boys that had been in the institution during the year to be 419, embracing some col-
-P-A-G-E-467

ored, 322 remaining under instruction October 31. They were taught the elementary 
English branches, with farm and shop work and brick making. The value of all the 
school property was $40,048 and the value of the farm products for the year $9,689. 
The State Industrial School, for girls, at Trenton, reported 51 inmates during 1882, their 
average age being 14} years. They received instruction in the common English branches; 
also, in sewing and housework. Particular attention was given to their moral and relig- 
ious training. 
The Newark City Home, a reformatory and industrial institution for boys and girls sup- 
ported by the city, reports 74 received and 72 paroled during the year, leaving at the 
close of 1882 156 inmates. All are given school instruction, with vocal music; the boys 
are taught brush making and farming; the girls, tailoring, dressmaking, and plain sew- 
Ing. 
= EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
Among the institutions of this class reporting are the West Jersey Orphanage, Cam- 
den, for destitute colored children; the Children’s Home, Mount Holly, and the Newark 
and Paterson Orphan Asylums. These schools seem to he doing good work and are 
said to be conducted by earnest men and women. For statistics of these and similar 
institutions, see Table XXII of the appendix. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The New Jersey State Teachers’ Association held its twenty-fifth annual meeting at 
Newark, December 26-27, 1882, President W. L. Dickinson, of Jersey City, in the 
chair. In his addtess of welcome the president warmly advocated the proposition that 
teachers should be men and women of thought and action, stimulating scholars to learn 
without too much explanation; he thought they should belong to the board of trustees 
and assert the dignity and importance of ‘their position. Superintendent De Graff pre- 
sented a paper on “‘A new departure in teachers’ institutes,’’ and offered resolutions that 
the association request the legislature at its next session to repeal the law for county 
institutes and establish for each congressional district a school to hold an annual 4-week 
session for normal training, $500 being given annually to each school. The resolutions 
were followed by a lively discussion and were finally referred to a committee, to be re- 
ported on at thenext meeting. The general drift of sentiment appeared to be that normal 
training in some form was essential to right teaching, even for those who had passed 
through the school curriculum. The next day Principal Hasbrouck, of the Normal 
School, dwelt on the need of thoroughness in mental training. Papers were then read 
on the “Reformation of delinquents’”’ and on ‘‘School libraries,’ followed by State 
Superintendent Apgar in defence of high schools, with an earnest appeal for retaining the 
county institute system. The resolutions relative to the system were referred to a com- 
mittee, to be reported upon at the next meeting. Before adjournment, Randal Spalding, 
of Mont Clair, was elected president for the ensuing year.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction, elected by the legislature for a term of 
3 years, has general charge of public school interests. Academic, collegiate, and pro- 
fessional training is.under.the direction of a board of regents of the.university. Local
-P-A-G-E-469
NEW’ YORK. 175 
school affairs are in charge of school commissioners elected by the people for 3 years 
(one for each school commissioner’s district) and of district boards of trustees, of 1 or 3 
members in ordinary districts and of 3 to 9 members in union districts. Women may 
hold school offices and vote in school meetings. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are sustained by the income of a common school fund, of the United 
States deposit fund, and by State and local taxation. All residents of a district 5 to 
21, and non-residents at the discretion of the trustees, are admitted, except Indian youth 
on reservations, fot whom other provision is made. Separate schools for colored children 
may be established by the school authorities of cities or of union districts, but facilities 
for instruction equal to those in the schools for white children must be provided in them. 
Districts, to be entitled to their share of the public school funds, must have sustained a 
school taught by a qualified teacher for at least 28 weeks the preceding school year, and 
no public school moneys may be paid to an unqualified teacher. To be legally qualified 
a teacher must have a normal school diploma or a certificate of qualification from the 
State superintendent, school commissioner of the district, or school officer of a city 
authorized by special act to grant a certificate. 
Provision is made in the law for district libraries, union or graded free schools with 
academic departments, teachers’ institutes, and State normal schools; also, for the in- 
struction of the deaf and dumb and the blind, for children in orphan asylums, for the 
care and instruction of idle and truant children, and for the compulsory attendance of 
children between 8 and 14 on some school for at least 14 weeks in each year, unless in- 
structed at home in the common school branches. The employment during school hours 
of any child under 14 who has not received this amount of instruction during the year 
preceding is prohibited under a penalty of $50. 
Free instruction in industrial drawing must be provided in all cities and in union and 
free school districts under special acts, unless such distiticts are excused by the State 
superintendent. All State normal schools must teach this branch.— (School laws.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show an increase of 19,000 in youth of school age, of more than that 
number in public school enrolment, and of over 10,000in average daily attendance, while, 
with the increased number of students in colleges, academies, normal and law schools, 
the whole number reported under instruction was over 30,000 greater than the previous 
year. Nearly half a million of dollars more was expended for public school purposes; 
more teachers were employed, at an increased average monthly salary; and over $58,000 
more were spent for school-houses, school furniture, &c., although the estimated value 
of all school property was reported less than in 1881. .‘‘ For many years there has heen 
an annual increase in the number of teachets employed for the full legal term of school,” 
a fact which, the superintendent thinks, shows an increasing interest in educational work, 
besides furnishing encouragement to teachers. The number of volumes in district 
libraries has been decreasing year by year, although the sum of $50,000 is annually 
appropriated for the purchase of books. This amount was in 1881~’82 divided nearly 
equally between the 744 city and the 11,257 rural school districts, the latter receiving, 
on an avetage, a little more than $2 each. The money, however, in a large majority of 
the rural districts, was used for the payment of teachers, the law authorizing this when 
the amount is less than $3. The superintendent advises that the annual appropria- 
tion for district libraries should be discontinued or else that the law be so amended as to 
materially improve the libraries. 
A new plan was adopted at the last institute examination of teachers which has given 
general satisfuction. It had previously been required that each applicant for a céer- 
tificate should pass in all the subjects prescribed. Now, should they fail in any 
branches, they are to receive credit for those in which they are successful, and are not 
required to p an examination in them again, but only in those in which they failed. 
They must, hoivever, pass in all the subjects within 3 yeats. The method of granting 
State certificates on examination, instead of on recommendation, required by a law of 
1875, has been productive of much god in taising the standard of teachers’ qualifica- 
tions.    
  INSTRUCTION OF INDIAN YOUTH. 
The report for 1882 gives 1,723 as the number of Indian children of school age in the 
State, the number of these etrolled in school as 1,169, and the average daily attendance 
as 645. One new school-housé was in process of erection and 2 more were needed. 
The receipts for the year were $8,595; expenditures, $8,243,

  176 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
No notice of any important changes in the school code has reached the Bureau except 
the following: (1) One requiring supervision of teachers’ classes in academies and union 
schools from school commissioners, with some additional provisions as to incorporation 
of academies; (2) one forbidding the incorporation of collegiate institutions without the 
approval of the regents of the university; (3) one amending regulations as to admission 
to the bar of students from Jaw schools or attorneys’ offices. 
KINDERGARTEN. 
For information as to schools of this class, see Table V of the appendix. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
The schools of cities and incorporated villages not under special charters are, like 
other union school districts, governed by boards of education elected by the people for 
3 years, one-third going out each year. A large number of the cities, however, have 
special school organizations under municipal charters; but all are under the supervision 
of boards variously styled boards of education, of trustees, or of supervisors, generally 
elected by the people. Nearly all the larger cities also have superintendents of schools. 
In New York City the mayor appoints the board, which is composed of 24 commission- 
ers. He also appoints 24 school inspectors, 3 for each of the 8 school districts into which 
the city is divided. A superintendent of schools and 7 assistant superintendents are 
appointed by the board, also 5 trustees for each ward.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Among several cities and villages containing 7,500 or more inhabitants, besides those 
enumerated in the above table, Hornellsville and Middletown had school systems organ- 
ized under special acts, but no report of their statistics has been received for the year 
1882. 
Albany reports a new school building finished, with seats for 448 pupils and costing 
$17,642, and another commenced which will accommodate 600 pupils and cost about 
$25,000, exclusive of site. The tendency towards a decrease in attendance apparent in

the two previous years was arrested in 1882, While the registry remained about the same 
as the previous year, the average membership increased hy 344 and the average attendance 
by 364. The half day absences fell off 11,898 and the cases of tardiness 2,794. The ex- 
perience of individual schools tended to show that the effort to reduce tardiness need not 
result in an increase of half day absences. There were 650 cases of truancy, though the 
number of truants was only about 500. An inquiry made by the police, at the instance 
of the board of education, showed that here were on the streets at one time 28 truants 
and 132 non-attendants at school between 6 and 16 years of age. The establishment of 
an ungraded school for such children is recommended. 
In December the board, after carefully considering the arguments pro and con, decided 
to suppress the forenoon and afternoon recesses, allowing a longer intermission at noon 
and dismissing pupils half an hour earlier in the afternoon. ‘The first.and second year 
classes were allowed 10 minutes of recess during the sessions and individual recesses were 
given freely on request. At the end of 3 months reports from all the schools as to the 
practical workings of the plan were so favorable that the new schedule was made per- 
manent. The course of study continued substantially as before. The rehearsal of short 
quotations was made a part of the daily exercises in all the grades. Drawing continued 
to be taught with enthusiasm, and the influence of this instruction has already been 
seen in the workshops and studios of the city. Satisfactory progress in music was made. 
There was a reduction of about one-half in cases of corporal punishment and this with- 
out any increase in the number of suspensions. The schools are learning to do without 
the infliction of pain as a means of discipline, the proportion of pupils now subjected to 
it being but 1 in 3,300. The high school reports a year of successful work. A training 
department for teachers has been added to its curriculum. Of 233 teachers employed 
(only 24 of them men), 109 were graduates of the high school, 64 of normal schools, and 
12 of colleges. 
In Auburn the school; are graded as primary, grammar, and high, each department 
occupying 4 years, and the last having two courses, an academic and a classical. No 
new departures were made during the year in methods of teaching or in school man- 
agement. Instruction in industrial drawing and in vocal music was given in all grades 
by special teachers. There was an increase of 124 in the number of pupils enrolled and 
of 65 in the average number belonging. As in 1880-’81, there was a decreased attend- 
ance in the advanced grades, owing to opportunities for employment offered. by prosper- 
ous business interests. The sanitary condition of the schools was good, but some of the 
rooms were so crowded thata new building was ordered. The most pressing need of the 
school system was some suitable provision for the idlers and truants of the community. 
Binghamton provides public school accommodations for 3,011 pupils, a few more than 
the number enrolled, in 9 school buildings, the latter valued, with other school prop- 
erty, at $204,367. ‘The schcols were classed as primary, grammar, and high and were 
taught 195 days. 
Brooklyn reports an increase of 2,197 in pupils enrolled and of 12 in teachers employed. 
The per cent. of average attendance on the number enrolled was 59.5; on the average 
enrolment it was 88.5. It appears that attendance is kept down by the lack of school 
accommodations, which have been insufficient for years. While there was room for addi- 
tional pupils in the higher grammar grades, the primary and lower grammar grades were 
overcrowded, and to reduce the latter to reasonable numbers and furnish accommoda- 
tions for the children excluded 15 new primary school buildings were needed. The 
attendance in evening schools increased during the year, but not so much as that in day 
schools. Over 8,200 pupils were enrolled during the fall term and 5,406 during the 
spring term, the average attendance in each being about half these figures. Consider- 
ing the few years that are spent by a majority of the public school children in school, 
the superintendent urges the importance of organizing an introductory class for children 
5 to 7 years of age, in which such instruction should be given as would awaken a desire 
for knowledge and create some aptness in its acquirement; also, the adoption of Kinder- 
garten methods in the regular school work of the lower grades. He emphasizes the 
necessity for a more generous support of the public schools and renews a former recom- 
ean for the establishment of two training schools for teachers.— (City report, 
1882. 
In Buffalo, with an increase of 2,081 pupils enrolled and of 1,134 in average attend- 
ance, under 13 more teachers, there was a decrease of $542 in public school expenditure. 
The average attendance was greatly lessened by sickness among the pupils, which, in some 
cases, led to closing the schools. Of the 20,687 pupils attending, only 5,460 were native 
Americans, 10,301 were Germans, 2,633 Irish, and 2,293 belonged to other nationalities. 
The system comprised 35 school districts and 55 grammar school buildings, of which 42 
were district property, 36 of the latter being built of brick and 6 of wood. The rented 
buildings were unfit for school purposes, being too small, devoid of sanitary appliances, 
and ill ventilated. In several districts, moreover, the school accommodations, inferior as 
125

they were, proved inadequate, many children being kept away through the want of room, 
while others remained out of school on account of the defective sanitary arrangements. 
‘The course of study, in the opinion of the superintendent, embraced more studies than 
can be pursued with advantage, and he thinks the least important subjects should be 
dropped, securing by this reduction more time for the studies of a practical character. 
Only 15 or 20 minutes, twice a week, can be given to drawing, and the same length of 
time, 3 times a week, to writing. More attention was given to the radiments of music 
than previously. The German language was studied by about 2,000 pupils in 16 of the 
district schools and in the high school, under 17 instructors.— (City report.) " 
Cohoes, with public schools classed as primary, grammar, high, and evening schools, 
reports 1,983 sittings for study in 8school buildings, valued, with other public school prop- 
erty, at $93,000. Public schools were taught 203 days during the year. There were 
about 600 pupils enrolled in private and parochial schools. 
The Elmira public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, are taught in 8 
buildings, affording 3,825 sittings for study. Besides the public school attendance above 
noted, there was an estimated enrolment of 631 pupils in private and parochial schools. 
| The public schools of Hudson, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught a 
term of 203 days in 8 buildings affording seats for 1,416 pupils. The estimated 
value of all property used for school purposes was $38,500. About 680 pupils were en- 
roiled in private and parochial schools. 
Ithaca reports an increase of 77 in youth of school age, of 28 in the number enrolled 
in public schools, and of 12 in average attendance. ‘There was an increase in the 
number of days of absence, but diminished tardiness. The sanitary condition of the 
school buildings received careful attention and great improvements have been made 
within the last few years in respect to lighting, seating, warming, and ventilating. 
Very young children are taught reading objectively, the written names being associated 
with the objects represented by them. In the more advanced grades methods of insttuc- 
tion have improved; in English, pupils are taught to use language correctly before they 
take up technical grammar; in history, the endeavor is made to awaken a desire to know 
much more about persons and events than the text books contain; and birthdays of noted 
authors are set apart for memorizing and reciting choice selections from their writings. 
In the high school a few minutes each morning and an hour on Friday afternoons are 
devoted to talks by the pupils, who are expected, when called upon, to give extempora- 
neously what they have prepared.— (City report.) 
The Kingston schools report a public school enrolment the same as in 1881, tardiness 
much less, order generally excellent, and corporal punishment seldom used, Commend- 
able oe was made in drawing and good work was done in vocal music.— (City re- 
rt. 
ae bakbdrt reports primary, grammar, and high schools taught for 194 days in 7 public 
school buildings affording 2,667 sittings for study and valued, with other property, at 
$105,000. About 500 pupils were enrolled in private and parochial schools. 
Long Island City reports an increased enrolment of 353 in public schools and 9 more 
pupils in average daily attendance. The teachers showed more earnestness and diligence 
in their work and greater interest was taken by pupils in their studies. The expense 
for school books was 50 per cent. less than in previous years, a fact that is given as an 
indication that the character of teaching had improved. 
In New York 298 schools under the supervision of the board of education and sharing 
in the public school funds reported an enrolment of 298,917 pupils, with 138,329 in aver- 
age attendance, an increase for the year of 14,018 in enrolment and of only 3,769 in 
average attendance. Of these schools 48 were corporate, including industrial and reform- 
atory schools, orphan asylums, &c.; 27 were evening schools; 2, a normal college and 
a training department; 1, a nautical school; 103 were grammar, 113 primary, and 4 col- 
ored schools. The grammar, primary, and colored schools report an increase for the year 
of 5,203 pupils in total enrolment, of 3,345 in average enrolment, and of 2,983 in aver- 
age attendance, 91 per cent. of the average enrolment having attended every session 
during the year. About 66 per cent. of the pupils belonged to primary grades and 34 
per cent. to the grammar schools, the same proportion as during 1881. Only about 26 
per cent. of pupils who commence the lowest grammar grade enter the highest. Of the 
3,544 teachers in all the schools sharing in public funds, 2,996 belonged to the primary, 
grammar, and colored schools and the training department, 209 of them being men and 
2,787 women. Of 199 licenses to teach conferred during the year, 141 were given to 
women, of whom 49 were graduates of the Normal College. Provisional certificates, good 
for 6 months, are usually given to beginners; and, after satisfactory evidence of ability 
to teach and govern schools, a permanent license is given, which remains in force as lon; 
as the teacher retains the position and does good work. Teachers can only be remove 
for cause after a hearing and on the decision of the city superintendent and two inspect- 
ors, from whom an appeal lies to the State superintendent; by this stability in the ten-

ure of office a better quality of instruction is secured than would otherwise be possible. 
All the public schools improved in reading, the primary schools in spelling also, and 
nearly atl in discipline, writing, and arithmetic. Discipline is carried on without corporal 
punishment, which is prohibited; pupils are kept so busy that there is little time for 
disorder or mischief. Only 10 classes out of 2,567, enrolling 20,000 children, or less 
than one-half of 1 per cent. of the classes, were found, on examination, to be notably de- 
ficient in discipline; and this result was obtained without frequent resort to suspension, 
there having been only 87 cases of this during the year. Marked progress has been made 
during the past 5 years in drawing, which is by State law a part of the course of study 
in all city public schools. Of the 2,500 classes examined in 1882, the work of 83 per 
cent. was excellent; of 15, good; and of 2, either fair orindifferent. The method of teach- 
ing music had also improved: there was less memorizing of exercises, with more atten- 
tion to reading music at sight. Good results are reported in the study of German and 
French, which are taught in 86 out of the 103 grammar departments — German in 75, 
French in 11—29 special teachers being employed. The law allows the introduction of 
these branches as optional studies in any grammar department in which they are desired 
by the parents or guardians of at least 30 pupils. Improvement is reported in the san- 
itary condition of many ofthe schools. The means of ventilation were as good as in most 
public buildings; the modes of egress were, as a rule, ample; and the careful attention 
given to sanitary matters had favorably affected the health of pupils. Still there were 
some overcrowded class rooms, principally in the primary departments, showing the 
necessity for several additional school buildings. 
The 27 evening schools, with 18,792 enrolled and 6,833 in average attendance, were 
divided into senior and junior schools; the former, having an optional course in reading, 
arithmetic, penmanship, book-keeping, and composition, admit only pupils 16 years old. 
and over; the latter have a graded course in the elementary branches and admit pupils 
13 to 18. In all there were classes for the instruction of foreigners learning English. 
The superintendent reports excellent discipline and instruction and general results fully 
justifying the expenditure forthe support of evening schools. The 48 corporate schools 
enrolled 27,673 pupils, of whom 9,690 were in average daily attendance, under 204 teach- 
ers. Of these, 21 were sustained by the Children’s Aid Society and 12 by the American 
Female Guardian Society. Theinstruction, which is improving year by year, was reported 
either excellent or good during 1882 in all the schools of the Children’s Aid Society and 
in all but one of the Female Guardian Society. Classification and methods of instruc- 
tion now conform to those of the public schools. Thousands of children who would other- 
wise find it difficult to attend school are instructed, some being able to attend only half 
a session each day, others even less. 
The nautical school gave instruction to 98 boys during the year in the common Eng- 
lish branches, as well as in practical seamanship. This séhool, established 9 years ago for the purpose of teaching seamanship to such young men as wish to become sailors, has 
proved asuccess. The demand for its graduates now exceeds the supply. 
The board of education has made the enforcement of the compulsory education law one of the duties of the city superintendent, who is assisted in it by 12 agents of truancy. 
Their work during the year 1882 was satisfactory, both in character and amount. The effi- ciency of the truancy department increases with time and experience, though the com- plete enforcement of the law is an impossibility in some wards, inasmuch as the school accommodations are not sufficient for the children who desire to attend. The number of 
non-attendants placed in school during the year was 882, an increase for the year of 480. Nearly halfof these were children of Italian birth or parentage, and about 800 other Italian children were placed in school by their parents, who had been aroused. by the measures taken to secure attendance. Duringthe year 2,495 cases of truancy received attention, and 1,617 of these were believed to be corrected, having been reported only once; of 878 who were reported more than once, 345, or 18 per cent. of the total number, were regarded as more or less incorrigible, a large decrease when compared with the returns of the previous year. Twice a year, and oftener if necessary, an examination is made into the condition of children employed in manufactories and other establishments. Employ- ers cheerfully give their assistance in securing the enforcement of the law forbidding the employment of children who have not the certificates required. The good influence of the compulsory education act is shown by the fact that there were 1,764 fewer arrests and commitments of children 8 to 14 during the 5 years after its passage than during the 5 preceding years, a decrease of 29 per cent. The stiperintendent recommends the estab- lishment of a reform school and three schools for truants or non-attendants, who are to be from them transferred to the public schools on proof of amendment, or, if incorrigible, to the reform school for confinement, discipline, and instruction.— (City report, 1882.) ’ Oswego.—Publie schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught 194 daysin 14 school buildings, capable of seating 3,610 pupils and valued, with other school prop-

erty, at $173,880. Over 1,300 pupils, it is estimated, were attending private and paro- 
chial schools. 
Poughkeepsie reports a prosperous year in the public schools, progress having been made 
in all the grades, the most marked being in reading, writing, and drawing. The half 
day plan for the younger children proved satisfactory, resulting in a continued increase 
in promotions, good health of the children, and in a reduction of expenses; had it not 
been adopted, additional buildings must have been provided. The public library is ex- 
tensively used and received from citizens important gifts both in money and books. 
There were 33,636 volumes circulated during the year, of which 21,221 were fiction, 
6,630 juvenile, and 5,785 miscellaneous.— (City report.) 
Rochester reports public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, taught 196 
days, in 27 buildings, containing accommodations for 13,030 pupils and valued, with 
other property, at $501,039. There was an estimated enrolment in private and paro- 
chial schools of 3,500 
In Rome the public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were taught 197 
days in 8 buildings, capable of seating 2,000 pupils and valued, with other school prop- 
erty, at $71,000. About 365 pupils attended private and parochial schools. 
In Syracuse the total public school enrolment was slightly greater than during the pre- 
vious year. Thepercentageof attendance on the average number belonging (96) remained 
about what it had been for a number of years past. Comparing the average num- 
ber belonging with the enrolment, or the latter with the school population, the figures 
are not so favorable: only about 80 per cent. of the number enrolled were in average 
attendance, only a little over 50 per cent. of the youth of school age were enrolled, and 
only 186 of the whole number were over 16 years of age. More than ample accommoda- 
tions are provided, there being 1,092 more seats than the average number belonging and 
1,430 more than the average daily attendance. Some needed repairs were made in the 
school buildings; and here, as elsewhere, increased attention has been given to the sani- 
tary condition of the schools, particularly in regard to the care and preservation of the 
eyesight of pupils. The high school had 483 pupils enrolled, 346 in average attendance, 
and graduated 45; the department for the training of teachers graduated 23. An un- 
graded school which had been sustained for 20 years past for the benefit of boys and young 
men who were employed during the greater part of the year, and which usually enrolled 
from 50 to 150 pupils, was discontinued in 1882 for want of funds. The evening school 
would also have been suspended for the same cause but for the generosity of Mr. William 
A. Sweet, who furnished means to pay the teachers. The school was open 4 months 
and gave instruction to 30 or 40 young men 4 evenings of the week.— (City report.) 
Utica reports 34 public schools, including primary, intermediate, advanced, academic, 
ungraded, and evening schools, a slight increase in enrolment, and a decrease in the num- 
ber of cases of tardiness, which amounted to only 1 for each pupil, while 10 years ago 
there were 3 for each. The results of the year’s work are considered very satisfactory. 
There was a general interest in the cause of education, and the people responded promptly 
to every demand for the improvement and extension of school facilities. An increase of 
population had rendered necessary additional school accommodations and a new build- 
ing had therefore been commenced. The sanitary condition of the schools was satisfac- 
tory. The annual examination showed that progress had been made in every department 
of study and especially in spelling. Two evening schools had 334 pupils enrolled. The 
academy had 172 in attendance and graduated 42, of whom 26 had completed a 4-year 
course, 8 one of 3 years, and 8 a normal course of 2 years. The city library was reported 
in good condition. There was a marked improvement in the choice of books, the call for 
works of light fiction having been reduced from 68 to 54 per cent. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Eight normal schools have been established by the State, situated at Albany, Brock- 
port, Buffalo, Cortland, Fredonia, Geneseo, Oswego, and Potsdam. An annual allow- 
ance of $18,000 is made by the legislature to each school, besides special appropriations, 
- which are granted from time to time. The State superintendent has the supervision of 
all these schools, the regents of the university being associated with him in the case of 
that at Albany. These schools enrolled 6,170 pupils during the year, of whom about 
3,000 were engaged in normal studies, preparing to teach, and 246 (49 men and 197 
women) were graduated. The Albany school has graduated 2,584 pupils since its open- 
ing in 1844; the Brockport school, 281 since 1867; Buffalo, 242 since 1871; Cortland, 343 
since 1869; Fredonia, 300 since 1868; Geneseo, 204 since 1871; Oswego, 1,060 since 1863, 
and Potsdam, 235 since 1869, a total of 5,249 graduates since the establishment of the 
first school in 1844, 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  NEW YORK. 181 > 
In view of the fact that only 1,183 of the 31,233 teachers employed in the State during 
the year were graduates of the normal schools, the question has been asked whether these 
schools are worth what they cost. But the State superintendent suggests that in answer- 
ing this question it should be borne in mind that the many who attend only afew terms 
and engage in teaching before graduating derive much benefit from their limited course 
and are far better teachers than they could be without such training; also, that those 
schools which are taught by persons who are graduates of normal schools are practi- 
cally subnormal schools, and thus the influence of the system is extended. 
To gain admission to these schools pupils must be atleast 16 years of age (the Albany 
school requiring young men to be 18) and have good health and average abilities; they 
must pass a fair examination inreading, spelling, geography, and arithmetic (as far asthe 
roots), and be able to analyze and parse simple sentences. Each county is entitled to 
twice as many pupils as it has representatives in the assembly. Appointments are made - 
by the State superintendent, subject to the required examination, on the recommendation 
of the several school commissioners or city superintendents of schools, whose duty it is to 
use every reasonable means to secure the selection of suitable candidates. Tuition and 
the use of text books are free, and to those who remain a full term the amount of fare 
necessarily paid in travelling is refunded. 
Three normal courses of study are arranged, an elementary of 2 years, an advanced 
English of 2, and a classical of 3, the last two courses requiring a preliminary examina- 
tion on the first year of the elementary course. The school at Albany provides a single 
course; the other schools had students in both elementary and advanced courses. Besides 
the above strictly normal courses of study there are academic departments connected 
with all these schools, except those at Albany and Oswego. All have schools of practice 
attached to them, those at Oswego and Fredonia including also Kindergarten depart- 
ments. The Potsdam school superintendent reports certain changes made during the 
year in the building, rendering it more convenient, and the beginning of a natural his- 
tory museum. Methods of teaching geography and grammar were improved, there was 
a Jarger enrolment of normal and academic students than ever before in the history of 
the school; and a demand arose for teachers for union and graded schools, especially for 
those fitted to teach Latin and Greek, which it was impossible tosupply. Greater atten- 
tion is to be paid hereafter to methods, rendering the school more strictly normal. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The New York Normal College has come safely through the transition from a3 toa 4year 
course of study. By this change it is hoped to reduce the number of graduates until 
the supply shall be only sufficient to meet the demands of the public schools, besides 
giving the apprentice teachers an additional year of training. Notwithstanding this 
lengthening of the course the number of students increased during the year from 1,214 
to 1,435. Such was the crowded condition of the college that for the first time in its 
history the drawing room was used for recitations; and such was the rush for admission to 
the model department that it became necessary to adopt measures to prevent overcrowd- 
ing. That the college is doing good work is clearly indicated by the fact that parents 
are very anxious to have their children in its schools. During the year 1,692 chil- 
dren, mainly residents of the immediate neighborhood, were instructed by 588 pupil 
teachers, under the careful supervision of a superintendent, a teacher of methods, and 25 
critic teachers. Owing to the addition of another year to the course of study there were 
no graduates in 1882, except 49 of the class of 1881, who chose to take the additional 
year as post graduates.— (Report of normal college.) 
A training department belonging to the Syracuse high school, which gives a year of 
special study and practice in normal methods, graduated 23 pupils during the year; 8 
students were graduated from the 2-year normal course of the Utica high school; 
and it was decided by the Albany board of education to organize a normal depart- 
ment in connection with the high school course of study of that city. Alfred and St. 
Lawrence Universities, when last heard from, provided courses of study for those de- 
siring to become teachers, and Elmira College instituted in September, 1882, a teachers’ 
class of 2 years. 
Several schools for the training of teachers in Kindergarten work report from New 
York. Their statistics may be found in Table III of the appendix. 
TEACHERS’ CLASSES IN ACADEMIES. 
Classes for the preparation of teachers are found in 80 academies and union schools. 
A law of 1877 authorizes the regents of the university to designate those schools in which 
instruction shall be given in the science and practice of common school teaching. Until 
1882 no provision for their supervision had been made, although the want of it had been 
long felt. The present law provides that each class shall be subject to the visitation of the 
school commissioner of the district in which the academy or union school is situated; he
-P-A-G-E-476
  182 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
is also required to assist in the organization, management, and final examination of the classes, and to report thereon to the regents of the university. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ institutes were held during 1882, as in the previous year, in 58 counties; in 1882 they numbered 73 and enrolled 13,231 teachers, a slight increase over the attend- 
ance of the previous year. The cost to the State was $16,040.72, or an average of 
$276.56 for each county and of $1.21 for each teacher. The importance of these insti- 
tutes is insisted on by the State superintendent and by reports of institute conductors 
published by him. One says the testimony as to their good results from commissioners, 
trustees, and patrons of schools is nearly universal, Another says that besides the orig- 
inal purpose of the institute, that of assisting young and untrained teachers, institutes 
have supplied a need felt by all classes of teachers, afforded a means of disseminating 
the latest views of teaching, of making general the gains in particular places, of unify- 
ing the teaching over wide areas, and of stimulating teachers to increased efforts, 
Another reports that institutes have resulted in an increased use of improved processes 
of school work not only in cities and villages, but in country districts, and in a marked 
increase of teaching power among teachers. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
Much educational information, very useful to teachers, was furnished in 1882 by the 
following educational journals: The School Bulletin, organ of the State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, a monthly, in its eighth volume; the School Journal, published weekly at New 
York City, in its twenty-fourth; the Teachers’ Institute, published monthly at the office 
of the School Journal, in its fourth; the Kindergarten Messenger, published monthly 
at Syracuse, in its sixth; the Industrial News, published monthly by the Inventors’ In- 
stitute, Cooper Union, New York City, in its third; the Scientific American, New York 
City, in its forty-sixth; the Penman’s Journal and Teachers’ Guide, New York, in its 
sixth; and The American Missionary, under the American Missionary Association, in 
its thirty-sixth. The last gives information in regard to the instruction of the colored 
race, the Indians, and the Chinese, but is specially devoted to the interests of the col- 
ored people. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS. 
Reports were received by the regents of the University of New York from 84 acade- 
mies and 173 academical departments of union schools which were entitled to receive aid 
from the public school funds, all having an enrolment of 34,257 pupils, under 1,304 
teachers, 9,874 of the students being allowed as academical out of 10,175 claimed as 
such. The academies are incorporated institutions, managed by boards of trustees; the 
academical departments are a part of the public schoo] system and supported by taxa- 
tion, but under the visitation and inspection of the board of regents in respect to their 
educational affairs and sharing equally with academies in the distribution of the litera- 
ture fund. The conditions under which charters may be granted to academies and aca- 
demical departments received under visitation were amended by the regents in July, 
1882, with a view to raising their standard. The changes, however, refer chiefly to the 
equipment of the institutions, the old regulations having been made nearly half a cen- 
tury ago, when the State was poor and sparsely populated. Under the new rules acade- 
mies must possess at least $5,000 above all encumbrances; their debts must not exceed 
one-third of the value of their property, which must include buildings worth at least 
$2,000, a library of suitable books, worth at least $500, and apparatus of equal value 
for instruction in physics, chemistry, and natural history. It must also appear that 
there is a reasonable prospect that the institution will be suitably supported and that 
it will be attended by at least 25 academical students. 
The regents renew their recommendation to the legislature that measures be taken to 
increasé the amount for distribution among the academies. The income available from 
the literature fund, $12,000 annually, is increased from the United States deposit fund 
to the sum of $40,000. This was the amount fixed on in 1840, when there were only 
133 academies to participate in the distribution and only 10,881 scholars in attendance, 
the average amount for eachacademy in 1840 being $338, while for 1883 it will be only 
about $155.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
This university, which is unique in character, was organized in 1784 and reorganized 
with enlarged powers and duties in 1787. It is composed of all the colleges, academies, 
and academic departments of union schools established in the State. The institutions 
included under the term college are such as are legally incorporated and possess the 
power to confer collegiate degrees; they include, therefore, colleges of arts, law schools, 
medical schools, and professional schools of science, but not schools of theology. A law 
of 1882 provides that hereafter no literary or scientific college shall be incorporated under 
the general act without the approval of the regents of the university. 
The colleges of liberal arts incorporated in the university numbered 22; the instructors 
in them, 363; the students, 3,769; the graduates of 1882, 503; the whole number gradu- 
ated from the beginning, 16,631. 
The amount of property owned by all the collegiate schools under the regents’ care, in- 
eluding schools of law, of medicine, and of pharmacy, as Well as those of literature and sci- 
ence, was estimated in 1882 at $22,955,943, exclusive of debts, an increase of $4,432,265 
over the valuation of 1881. Adding the property of the academic schools ($3,046,912 
over debts in 1882) there was a total of $26,002,855 under the university system of the 
State. Cornell and Columbia together held property valued at $12,241,768. 
LITERARY COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Of this class there were in 1882 connected with the university 17, which, given in the 
report for 1881 in the order of their age, are arranged alphabetically by their post offices 
asfollows: Alfred University, Alfred; St. Bonaventure’s College, Allegany; St. Stephen’s 
College, Annandale; St. Lawrence University, Canton; Hamilton College, Clinton; St. 
John’s College, Fordham; Hobart College, Geneva; Madison University, Hamilton; 
Cornell University, Ithaca; College of St. Francis Xavier, College of the City of New 
York, University of the City of New York, Columbia College, and Manhattan College, all 
in New York City; University of Rochester, Rochester; Union University, Schenectady 
(with professional schools at Albany), and Syracuse University, Syracuse. 
Of the 17 mentioned, 13 were for young men and 4— Alfred, St. Lawrence, Cornell, and. 
Syracuse—admitted young women also. In the whole 17 there were for 1881-’82, under 
281 instructors, 3,198 students, of whom 435 were graduated. For the prevailing re- 
ligious influences, if any, in the several colleges named, see Table IX of the appendix. 
Six Roman Catholic colleges—St. Francis College and St. John’s College, Brooklyn; 
Canisius College and St. Joseph’s College, Buffalo; St. Louis College, New York City; and 
the College of our Lady of Angels, Suspension Bridge —and the Collegiate and Polytechnic 
Tnstitute, Brooklyn (non-sectarian), are placed by the regents’ report in the list of aca- 
demic institutions. 
All the colleges gave instruction in French and German, as well as in the traditional 
Latin and Greek, St. Stephen’s, which prepares for a theological course, substituting He- 
brew for German. Hobart College, preparing also to some extent for theological study, 
offered preliminary training in Hebrew, which language was offered, too, at Alfred and 
Madison Universities and at St. Bonaventure’s College, all of which had theological 
courses. Sanscrit was offered at Cornell University and Columbia College, and Anglo- 
Saxon at both of these, as well as at Hobart College and Madison and Syracuse Univer- 
sities. These offers were availed of at Columbia atleast, which taught also Danish, Span- 
ish, and Italian, and offered Icelandic. Cornell offered Swedish, Spanish, and Italian. 
The College of the City of New York, formerly open only to students from the public 
schools, was in 1882 opened to all duly prepared male students residing in the city. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the high grade collegiate schools that go to make up the 22 in the university, 5 are 
for young women only, namely: Wells College, Aurora; Elmira Female College, Elmira; 
Ingham University, Leroy; Rutgers Female College, New York City; and Vassar College, 
Poughkeepsie. All have courses embracing the full 4-year classical curriculum, with 
French and German (usually optional, instead of Greek), drawing, painting, and music, 
and they are all well equipped for their work. The requirements for admission at 
Ingham and Rutgers are considerably lower than at the 3 other institutions, where 
they are as high as is usual in the better class of colleges for men. The property of 
Vassar was valued in 1881-’82 at $1,019,572, and it received that year $3,000 fora 
scholarship fund. Wells College came into possession of $100,000 for endowment, ad- 
ditional toa like sum previously received from the same person (Hon. Edwin B. Morgan) 
:for the same purpose; the gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Morgan to the college aggregate over

    184 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
$260,000. In these 5 colleges there were for the year 80 instructors and 569 students, of 
whom 56 were graduated. 
Besides the 5 regents’ colleges, 21 other schools for young women claim place among 
those giving superior instruction, for statistics of which, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The United States Military Academy, West Point, established to train skilled officers 
for the Army, gives this training in a 4-year course, including the study of the English, 
French, and Spanish languages; international and military law; mathematics; drawing; 
natural and experimental philosophy; geography, history, and ethics; chemistry, miner- 
alogy, and geology; tactics; civil and military engineering; ordnance and gunnery; and 
practical military engineering, military signalling, and telegraphy. The examinations 
are rigid, and students failing any year to reach the standard for promotion are turned 
back for at least another yearofstudy or discharged. Out of the graduating class of 37 in 
June, 1882, 11 had been in the academy more than 4 years and 13 of its original mem- 
bers were in the following class. There were 191 students in 1881~’82, under 47 in- 
structors. 
The scientific instruction given under the university system of the State comprised (1) 
courses of general science in 17 collegiate schools belonging to the university, which were 
of 3 to 4 years in duration and differed from the classical courses mainly in the substi- 
tution of French or German for Greek or of both French and German for Latin and Greek, 
sometimes with mathematics and natural sciences in place of literary studies; (2) courses 
more specifically scientific, such as the courses of 4 years each at Cornell University in 
agriculture, in architecture, in mechanicarts, in civil engineering, in analytical chemistry, 
in chemistry and physics, and in natural history; and the 6 others, also of 4 years, at Colum- 
bia College, in mining engineering, civil engineering, metallurgy, geology, analytical and 
applied chemistry, and architecture. Besides, there were civil engineering courses of 4 
years eachat Union College, Schenectady; atSyracuse University, Syracuse, and at Rens- 
selaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, with one of 3 years at the University of the City of 
New York and a graduate course of 2 years in the College of the City of New York. Co- 
lumbia College had a school of political science for graduates, with a 3-year course lead- 
ing to the degree of PH. D. 
For statistics of scientific schools, see Table X of the appendix; fora summary of them, 
a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.— A graduate course in theology of 1 year at St. Lawrence University, Canton 
(Universalist), and courses of 3 years, meant to follow a collegiate course, were continued 
in 1881-82 in connection with St. Bonaventure’s College, Allegany (Roman Catholic), 
and Madison University, Hamilton (Baptist), of the institutions forming a part of the 
University of the State of New York. Besides these there were the following theologi- 
cal schools: Auburn Theological Seminary, Auburn (Presbyterian); De Lancey Divinity 
School, Geneva (Protestant Episcopal); Hamilton Theological Seminary, Hamilton (Bap- 
tist); Hartwick Theological Seminary,’ Hartwick (Lutheran); General Theological Sem- 
nary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, New York; Union Theological Seminary, 
New York (Presbyterian); Rochester Theological Seminary, Rochester (Baptist); Chris- 
tian Biblical Institute, Stanfordville (Christian); St. Andrew’s Divinity School, Syracuse 
(Protestant Episcopal); Seminary of Our Lady of Angels, Suspension Bridge; and St. 
Joseph’s Provincial Seminary, Troy (Roman Catholic). All appear to have had 3-year 
courses except the Roman Catholic, which mingle collegiate and theological training. 
Union Theological Seminary, New York, has beyond its 3 years a graduate course of 
another year. 
Law.— Four schools of law connected with the University of the State of New York 
for 1881-’82 reported to the regents 609 students, under 24 instructors, and 245 gradu- 
ates, making a total of 2,850 graduates in law since the establishment of the uni- 
versity. These schools are the Albany Law School, Albany, a department of Union 
University; Maynard-Knox Law School of Hamilton College, Clinton; School of Law of 
Columbia College, New York; and the department of law in the University of the City 
of New York. All had, for the year reported, courses of 2 years, covering 35 to 38 weeks 
each year, for students that had no preliminary legal training, Albany taking off a year 
for any one that had previously read law for that time. Columbia required an exami- 
nation for admission of students not shown to be college graduates who seek to get a 
degree from the law school, this examination being in the literary studies preparatory to 
the collegiate ‘course. Its subsequent course appears to be exceptionally thorough also.     
1A German-Lutheran theological school is also connected with Martin Luther College, Buffalo.

NEW YORK. . 185 
Under the laws of New York State, admission to the bar is regulated by the court of 
appeals, which promulgated amended rules to take effect July 1, 1882. These provide 
that a person must show his fitness to begin the study of the law by passing the regents’ 
examination, unless he is a college graduate, after which, being over 18 years of age, he 
must serve a regular clerkship of 3 years in an attorney’s office, or 2 years if a college 
graduate. Time actually spent in a qualified law school in operation 8 months of each 
year will be accepted in lieu of that required in the clerkship, but ‘‘in no case shall an 
applicant be entitled to admission as an attorney and counsellor without having served 
a clerkship in the office of a practising attorney of the supreme court for the period of at 
least 1 year.” Vacations of the law school may be utilized in serving the clerkship. 
On completing his preparation, the applicant must pass an examination in the law, 
conducted by the judges of the supreme court at a general term or by not less than 3 
practising lawyers, of at least '7 years’ standing at the bar, appointed by the court. 
Medicine. — Out of 17 colleges connected with the university the education in which 
is in some branch of medical science and the degree from which is a medical degree, 15 
reported to the regents for 1881-82 a total of 258 instructors and 3,127 students, of 
whom 949 were graduated, making 15,409 graduates since the foundation of these col- 
leges. Of the schools reporting, 7 were ‘‘regular;”’ 2, eclectic; 1, homeopathic; 1, 
dental; 2, pharmaceutical; and 2, veterinary. One homeopathic college, not reporting 
to the regents but sending its statistics to this Bureau, adds 21 instructors, 42 students, 
and 10 graduates to those above given; besides which the Woman’s Medical College of 
the New York Infirmary, not on the regents’ list, and yet a high grade school, reports 22 
instructors, 41 students, and 9 graduates. The figures of these schools, added to the re- 
gents’ summary, make 301 instructors, 3,210 students, with 968 graduates for the year 
and 15,428 from the beginning. 
As a rule, these schools continued to require 3 years of study under a medical pre- 
ceptor and attendance on 2 regular lecture courses covering from 20 to 35 weeks each. 
This last (which was the highest) requirement as to time was in the medical department 
of the University of Syracuse, next to which in this respect came the Woman’s Medical 
College of the New York Infirmary, with 34 weeks. ' Both require preliminary exami- 
nations of students that present no evidence of literary qualifications and both have 
graded courses of 3 years, with examinations at the close of each year for promotion and 
graduation. 
The diplomas of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Buffalo (eclectic), and the 
United States Medical College, New York, of the same school of practice, are not recog- 
nized by the Illinois State board of health as valid in that State. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION FOR POLITICAL LIFE, 
This went forward, as in 1880-’81, at Cornell University, Ithaca, and at Columbia 
College, New York City; at the former, in a course in history and political science that 
covered 4 collegiate years, the requirements for entrance being those of the course in 
arts and course in science combined; at the- latter, in a school of political science that 
covered 3 years from the opening of the fourth collegiate year. The studies at Cornell 
were for the first 2 years largely in language and history; for the last 2, in American his- 
tory and in political science, theoretically and historically considered. At Columbia the 
first 3 years are those of the collegiate course; the remaining 3 embrace subjects proper 
to a course in political science. 
TRAINING IN FINE ARTS. 
The College of Fine Arts, Syracuse University, continued in 1882 its 4-year courses in 
architecture, painting, and music, the schedules in which indicate especial thoroughness. 
Wells College, Aurora, had still its instruction in painting, drawing, and music in its col- 
lege of fine arts and conservatory of music; Elmira College, in its school of arts of design 
and school of music; and Rutgers Female College, New York, and Vassar College, Pough- 
keepsie, in departments of drawing, painting, and music. 
The University of the City of New York taught painting and drawing in its school of 
art, under a highly trained instructor, and, in common with Cornell University, Colum- 
bia College, and the College of the City of New York, taught architectural, free hand, 
and mechanical drawing in its civil engineering course. 
The Art Students’ League, New York, is reported to have had 100 different models 
employed in the life and portrait classes of 1881-’82, starting a still life class in connec- 
tion with the latter. Its painting class had 77 members; the antique class, 152; the 
sketch class, 80; the composition class, over 50. The school hadareserve fund of $5,000. 
The American Art School, New York City, offered instruction in free hand drawing 
and all branches of painting, including mineral, oil, and water colors, with coloring for 
photographs; also, in wood carving, etching on linen, and all styles of art needlework. 
   
-P-A-G-E-480
  186 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The Decorative Art Society, Buffalo, had classes in drawing, designing, sketching from 
life, flower tapestry, and china painting, embroidery, and clay modelling. 
In the Misses Osgood’s Art School, New York, instruction was given in painting on silk, 
satin, and plush with oil and water colors; in object drawing, crayon, landscape and fig- 
ure painting, painting on china, tapestry, wood carving, &c. The school is open sum- 
mer and winter, and since its opening to June, 1882, 9,000 lessons are said to haye been 
given, Other statistics are wanting. 
The Woman’s Institute of Technical Design, New York City (established 1881), in 1881-’82 
gave instruction to 41 pupils in designing for carpets, wall paper, lace, silk, chintz, calico, 
oilcloth, linoleum book covers, wood carving, embroidery, &c. A Jacquard loom was 
used for demonstrating, dnd it was said that its value to the pupils could not be over- 
estimated. The effort was to make the course of instruction thorough in all its details, 
its aim being to fit graduates to fill positions in the design room for any branch of indus- 
try which they may have pursued in the institute. There were 475 drawings made by 
the pupils during the school year. A course of adjunct lectures was given by practical 
workmen in the different designs, which was largely attended by the pupils and their 
friends, Of the 41 pupils of the institute, 32 received certificates. 
TRAINING FOR SEAMANSHIP. 
The Nautical School of the Port of New York, meant to train pupils in the elements of 
an ordinary school course as well as in the science and art of navigating and managing 
a ship, had in 1882, the ninth year of its existence, 98 pupils, a diminution of 9 from the 
preceding year. It is housed in the school ship St. Mary’s, loaned for the purpose by the 
United States Government, and spends about 6 months each year in school work and the 
same in practical seamanship. The demand for graduates from it is said to far exceed. 
the supply. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC. 
The New York College of Music, incorporated by the State, 1879, in New York City, 
offered a thorough course of instruction in vocal and instrumental music. The building 
is adapted to the methods of the institution, permitting separate lessons to be carried on 
in all departments of music at once, without one disturbing another. The present 
accommodations and faculty are sufficient for the separate individual instruction of 700 
students. Public benefit concerts are to be given by thestudents for the endowment of 
a scholarship fund, the benefit of which will be awarded only to pupils of exceptional 
talent and limited means. Diplomas in art and degrees in music are conferred on the 
recommendation of the director and faculty, under the authority of the State. The total 
number of students under instruction at the college in 1881—’82 was 854. 
From the Baxter University of Music, Friendship, no information for 1882 has been 
received, nor any from the Voght Conservatory of Music, New York. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Cooper Union, New York City, besides 936 in a free scientific course and 60 in a free 
class of telegraphy, taught 1,227 in its free evening art classes and 711 more continu- 
ously in its art schools for women, all meant to prepare for profitable industrial work 
and in many instances securing it. Twohundred were taught also in a literary class, and 
as many more in a class in elocution, A free reading room, visited by about 1,500 
readers daily for current publications, and a library of the established literature of the 
language and of booksin popular science and knowledge aided still further in the work 
above indicated. 
The New York Trade School, occupying a building erected in 1881 by the founder of 
the school, R. T. Auchmuty, aimed to make efficient and practical mechanics who might 
become self supporting tradesmen. Instruction was given in bricklaying and sanitary 
engineering, house, sign, and decorative painting, There were also special courses in 
mixing colors, in fresco painting, and in polishing and repairing hard wood, During 
1881-’82 there were 52 young men instructed in the school, 
The Kitchen Garden Association, New York, has in that city a school for teaching 
girls the various branches of household industry by an adaptation of object teaching. 
‘The instruction is embodied in 6 lessons, each requiring one month’s application. These 
lessons comprehend the details of chamberwork, sweeping, dusting, and arranging 
rooms, washing, preparing and cooking meats, and making pastry. The work for the 
last year is said to have been in every way successful, and through this simple Kinder- 
garten system the children acquire the order and neatness essential to household service. 
‘The society has also aided in organizing like schools in various other cities through the 
agency of a travelling teacher of the system,

City, combines common school studies with industrial training,laying the foundation of 
instruction in the Kindergarten and carrying it on in graded courses of 2 years each. In 
the first 2 years (from 7 to 9 years of age) clay prepared for the purpose is used instead 
of wood, with suitable tools for the work; from 9 to 11 the children use wood and a 
small saw; from 11 to 13, the scroll saw, to work in wood at first and later on in zinc. 
At 13, beginning the seventh school year, the pupils are admitted into the large field of 
carpentry, with the complete outfit of a workshop. No statisticsof the numberof youth 
in training have been received for 1882, . 
The Children’s Aid Society of New York City, recognizing that the criminal classes are 
filled from the neglected and outcast children of the city, has sought by early care and 
instruction of the young to prevent crime, reasoning that it is more economical to check 
it in its beginning by care than in its advanced stages by punishment. Some of the re- 
sults of its labors are that during the 28 years of its existence 1,343,166 lodgings have 
been furnished, 14,832 wandering boys have been returned to their friends, and 20,720 
boys have saved and placed in the bank $55,567; that hundreds of thousands have been 
trained in its 21 industrial schools or tanght in its 13 night schools; and that thousands 
have been refreshed and restored to health by its Sick Mission and Summer Home. 
During the year 1881~82 8,456 boys and 1,058 girls were sheltered, fed, and instructed 
in the lodging houses, of whom 1,392 were furnished employment and homes in the 
country and 571 returned to their parents and friends. In the industrial schools there 
were 9,337 boys and 4,631 girls taught during the year by 89 teachers, with an ayerage 
daily attendance of 3,676 pupils. In the sewing machine school, instruction was given 
to 323 girls, while others were taught dressmaking and laundry work. The Italian 
school an average attendance of 706 pupils, and through the efforts of the Italian 
truant officer the streets are gradually being relieved of Italian vagrant children, whose 
education and industrial training form an important branch of the work of the society. 
The Brooklyn Children’s Aid Society has two industrial schools for children, in which 
the pupils are not only instructed, but clothed and fed at need; a sewing machineschool 
for girls; an evening school for newsboys; and a kitchen garden for very young children, 
In the sewing machine school 305 girls received lessons and 723 different children were 
in the industrial schools. 
The Brooklyn Industrial School Association in its twenty-eighth annual report gives 1,079 
as the number of children in attendance during the year in its 6 schools. Five of these 
schools were attended by pupils who had homes, the other was for the inmates of the 
Home for Destitute Children belonging to the association. e 
The Industrial School Association of Brooklyn reported 269 children cared for during 
1881-82 and 216 instructed in reading, writing and sewing in its school. 
The American Female Guardian Society, New York City, for 1881-’82 had in its 12 indus- 
trial schools about 5,221 children too poor to attend the public schools, with an average 
attendance of more than 1,725, under 50 teachers. 
The House of the Good Shepherd, Tomkins Coye, trains poor children of either sex for 
farmwork, for service, or fortrades. It had 19 boys and 17 girls. 
The Five Points House of Industry, New York City, taught 1,078 pupils in 1881-82, with 
an average attendance of 377. There were 234 women, 340 boys, and 208 girls in the 
house, Besides common school studies the boys were taught printing; the women 
and girls, sewing and housekeeping. Religious training was also a feature of the insti- 
tution, 
The Hebrew Benevolent Society, New York City, reports that of 187 inmates in its or- 
phan asylum (for boys) 130 were taught in the public schools and 57 in its home school, 
that in an industrial school 16 were trained in shoemaking or printing, and that of 115 
girls in the female department 105 were taught in city primary and grammar schools and 
1 at the Normal College, 9 remaining at the home. 
The General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York, in its ninety- 
eighth year, reports a school prosperous in condition and satisfactory in every branch, with 
an average attendance higher than for many previous years, but does not give statistics 
(except of $3,211 expended for salaries and supplies). The school consisted of a male 
department, in which instruction was given to a large number of young men and boys 
in free hand, mechanical, and architectural drawing, and of a female department, in 
which drawing from objects and designing are the principal studies. 
Wilson Industrial School, for girls, New York City, in its day schools instructed 200 
irls in pvr English branches, while in a kitchen garden they were taught house- 
old duties, 
The Industrial School of Rochester still maintained its benevolent care of the poor and 
destitute children in the city, training them as far as possible in the simple industries of 
household life through kitchen garden and sewing instruction classes.

  188 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
INSTRUCTION OF THE BLIND. 
The number of pupils in the New York Institution for the Blind in 1881-’82 was 231. 
Of these, 22 were dismissed, leaving 209 under instruction at the close of the year. The 
school is graded, beginning with a Kindergarten and advancing on through a normal ’ 
training department. Vocal and instrumental music were given, also industrial and 
physical training. Discipline was maintained without corporal punishment of any kind. 
INSTRUCTION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
There were 1,333 pupils under instruction in the several institutions for the deaf and 
dumb during the year, of whom 738 were State pupils and 368 county, besides whom 
122 were supported by the State of New Jersey and 105 by parents and friends. 
Of the above number, 500 pupils were in the institutions at Washington Heights, 
New York City, 184 being females and 50 semi-mutes, all taught by 20 teachers, 5 of 
whom were deaf-mutes and 4semi-mutes. In addition to school duties here the boys were 
taught cabinet making and carpentry and the girls baking and dressmaking. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
UNIVERSITY CONVOCATION. 
This meéting, first held August 4 and 5, 1863, and since annually continued, consists of 
such members of the board of regents of the university and such instructors, officers, and 
trustees of the colleges, academies, and other seminaries constituting the university and 
subject to the visitation of the regents as may in each year attend. Held under the 
auspices of the regents and representing their 36 colleges, with some 10,000 students, as 
well as 266 academies and high schools, with about 30,000 scholars, it aims to advance 
the standard of education, to harmonize all action looking to this end, and to recommend 
to the institutions which it represents such action in these directions as may be expedi- 
ent and lawful. Its session of July 11-13, 1882, was opened with an address from Hon. 
Henry R. Pierson, chancellor of the university, which showed the prosperity of its vari- 
ous institutions for the year, indicated the high character of its academic principals, and 
gave statistics of the examinations for certificates in its academic schools from 1866 to 
1882, as well as of diplomas issued up to date and for the year. The remainder of the 
program for the session was as follows: ‘‘ Libraries and how to use them,”’ by Prin- 
cipal H. C. Kirk, of Phelps Union School; ‘Methods of instruction in English litera- 
ture,’’ by Prof. Gilmore, of the University of Rochester; ‘‘Theories in science,’”’ by Prof. 
Costin, of St. John’s College, Fordham; “‘ Realism and nominalism,’’ by Prof. Wilson, 
of Cornell University; ‘French and German in colleges and schools,’’ by Prof. H. S. 
White, of Cornell; ‘‘ Regents’ examinations,’’ by Principal Bradley, of the Albany High 
School; ‘‘ Military drill in colleges and academies,”’ by President Waterbury, of the State 
Normal School at Albany; ‘‘ Report on normal training in colleges,”’ by a committee of 3 
college professors; ‘‘ Teaching physical science in academies,’’ by Professor Cooley, of Vas- 
sar College; ‘‘ Classes for instructing common school teachers in academies,” by Principal 
Graves, of Bainbridge Union School; ‘‘Should American colleges be open to women as 
wellas to men?” by President Barnard, of Columbia College; with necrological notices of 
Regent R. 8. Hale and Hon. E. B. Morgan, both prominent in State affairs and the latter 
very liberal to education; of Clarkson Nott Potter, a distinguished lawyer and politician, 
trustee of Union University; of Prof. J. W. Mears, of Hamilton College, remarkable for 
his metaphysical researches and ability; of Chancellor Henry P. Tappan, professor for 6 
years of moral and intellectual philosophy in the University of the City of New York and 
subsequently head of the University of Michigan, as well as author of important treatises 
on education and philosophy; of Principal James P. Harrington, of the Utica Advanced 
School, said to have been a model teacher; and of Prof. John W. Draper, author of vari- 
ous scientific treatises, of the History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, History 
of the Conflict Between Science and Religion, and of the Civil War in America. Of 
Professor Draper other notice will be found in an obituary, further on. 
NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its thirty-seventh annual meeting at Yonkers, July 5~7, 1882. 
In his address of welcome Mr. Smith, the president of the Yonkers board of education 
found encouragement in the fact that study is made more attractive than formerly, 
that exertion of the mental powers has become a pleasure. Though the main function 
of the public school, he said, is to produce facility in a few things rather than give a 
smattering of many, still the whole mind must be educated. State Superintendent 
Gilmour responded, saying that the office of education is to elevate and advance labor
-P-A-G-E-483
  NEW: YORK. 189 
and to improve mankind. The State” believes that education has a business basis and 
that he who would teach well must be specially prepared for teaching. President Wat- 
kins in his address said that not only intelligent but healthy citizens were demanded of 
the public schools and it was therefore necessary to diffuse a knowledge of the proper 
means of bringing up children and to select those studies which would, develop the 
mental powers. The publicschool must also impart a moral character to its pupils, teach- 
ing them to love truth and hate a lie, to cultivate honesty and to be worthy of trust. Mr. 
Humphrey read the report of the ‘‘ committee on the condition of education,’’ saying that 
amarked change has been going on, the most marked being instruction in language rather 
than in technical grammar; that more cultureis given, but that the country schools still 
come short of what is to be desired; and that there is in these schools a field for real 
missionary work. The school commissioners too, he thought, are too much under the 
heel of politicians, and had to make themselves popular by giving certificates where 
they would ‘‘do the most good;’’ but one real improvement is that the office of insti- 
tute conductor has been created and made permanent. A report on industrial educa- 
tion was read, which set forth aneed of revision in the system of education, that the lower 
grades of work of the world are shabbily done, that there is a demand for better work 
and better workmen, that hand laboris a powerful factor in education, and that the pub- 
lic school should prepare for special industrial training. At the close of this report many 
questions were asked, showing that great interest had been aroused. Mrs. Hunt after- 
wards dwelt on the need of teaching temperance. United States Senator Warner Miller 
gave an address on the relation of education to the government, saying that education is 
one of the four great departments of state government, costing more than any other; that 
the teacher is a public officer, and as such entitled to a respectable social position. 
In common with a preceding speaker, the senator advocated industrial schools. Papers 
were then read on ‘‘ Teachers’ institutes’ and on ‘‘ Limits of oral teaching.”” Mr. J. A. 
Nichols was elected president for the ensuing year. 
ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COMMISSIONERS AND CITY SUPERINTENDENTS, 
The school commissioners and superintendents met at Albany January 25, 1882, G. 
V. Chapin presiding. Out of 135 members only 40 were present. President Chapin de- 
livered an address advocating practical methods of teaching, urging that the child be 
studied, his capacities ascertained, and the supervision of the schools adapted to de- 
velop spirit, energy, and knowledge. Papers on ‘‘ Examining and licensing teachers?’ 
and ‘‘The way in which normal schools can best serve the State’’ were read and dis- 
cussed at length. In the latter paper Professor Palmer suggested that normal schools 
should give instruction in class subjects as well as training in methods, for in an exam- 
ination in Michigan only 2 teachers out of 30 were able to explain what the mental facul- 
ties are. Superintendent Sanford proposed that all persons seeking licenses as teach- 
ers should at least hold a regents’ certificate of academic qualifications. 
‘The following resolutions were adopted: (1) To request a’ change in the beginning of 
the school year; (2) to urge the passage of the bill prescribing qualifications for com- 
missioners; (3) to secure a township system; and (4) to foster a professional spirit 
among the teachers. At the election of officers Mr. Edward Wait was chosen president 
for the ensuing year, after which the association adjourned, to meet at Little Falls. 
NOTEWORTHY BENEFACTIONS. 
The returns show gifts received during the year by seven colleges and universities, 
amounting to $183,480, as follows: To St. Stephen’s College about $12,000, for annual 
expenses and for scholarships, most of it from the Society for Promoting Religion and 
Learning; to Wells College $100,000, from Edwin D. Morgan; to Hobart College a house 
and lot, worth about $4,000, and $480 in cash; to Cornell University, from Hon. H. W. 
Sage, $2,000 for the department of history and political science ; to Ingham University 
$20,000, from various friends, to liquidate indebtedness ; to Columbia College $5,000, for 
the equipment of a department of architecture, but only to be applied to the purchase 
of models and drawings; and to Syracuse University $40,000, from several friends, to en- 
dow a professorship of Greek and ethics. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
JOHN W. DRAPER. 
Prof. John W. Draper, M. D., LL. D., died at his home, at Hastings-on-the-Hudson, 
January 4, 1882, in the seventy-first year of his age. Born at St. Helen’s, near Liverpool, 
Eng., in 1811, he came to this country with his family in 1833. In 1836 he graduated 
in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; became professor of chemistry and physi- ©

ology in Hampden Sidney College, Virginia, returning in 1839 to New York, to filla 
like position in the University of the City of New York, in which he remained until 
his death. Dr. Draper’s favorite study was chemistry, but his researches embraced a 
wide range of natural sciences. In spectrum analysis and photography his discoveries 
were of special value; he was the first to obtain a photographic picture from life, and 
also the first to secure a photograph of the moon in 1840, ten years before De la Rue, 
to whot Europeans ascribe the first success. His researches through the spectroscope 
were the first on this side of the Atlantic. He held the position of president of the Med- 
ical Society of New York University for many years. He wrote extensively, and his 
works have been translated into many languages. Few American books have been pub- 
lished in as many foreign tongues as Dr. Draper’s most important literary work, the 
Intellectual Development of Europe. His Human Physiology has long been a standard 
work and has passed through many editions and his Chemistry and Natural Philosophy 
were very popular in the schools.— (Regents’ report, 1883; The Congregationalist, Jan- 
tary 11, 1882; Scientific American, January 14; The School Journal, January 7, 1882.) 
DR. JAMES R. WOOD. 
James R. Wood, mM. p., one of the foremost of American surgeons, died in New York of 
dant in May, 1882, having reached his sixty-sixth year. He was born in New 
ork and there he achieved his reputation and secured great benefits to medical edu- 
cation. He was a graduate of the old medical college at Castleton, Vt. To Dr. Wood 
were chiefly due the relief of Bellevue Hospital from political management and its estab- 
lishment on an effective basis and the erection and use of the pathological building of Belle- 
vuaeasa school to combine clinical with didactic instruction. Even the existence of Bellevue 
Medical College and the bill giving to medical and surgical institutions the bodies of va- 
grants for dissection, which spoiled the trade of the resurrectionists, were due to his efforts. 
Dr. Wood was for several years professor of operative surgery and surgical pathology in 
Bellevue, and after his resignation of this position was made emeritus professor of surgery. 
At the time of his death he was connected, for consultation, with a dozen hospitals, 
asylums, and dispensaries in New York and vicinity. It was said of him during his 
life by an eminent surgeon that no living surgeon had performed so many capital and 
minor operations as successfully and that he stood preéminent as a surgeon.— (New 
Hampshire Sentinel, May 24, 1882.) 
CHARLES MURRAY NAIRNE. 
Prof. Charles Murray Nairne, M. A., L. H. D., of Columbia College, died in May, 1882, 
at Warrenton, Va., where he had been residing for some months with a view to restoring 
his health. He was born in Perth, Scotland, April 15, 1808, and was graduated M. A. 
at St. Andrew’s University, receiving the degree of L. H. D. in 1830. In 1847 he cameto 
this country and settled in Albany, where he taught some years in the female academy, 
Tn 1857 he was called to the professorship of moral and intellectual philosophy and Eng- 
lish literature in Columbia College, which he filled continuously 25 years. Professor 
Nairne contributed frequently to the college papers and was the author of several works, 
the most prominent being Lectures and Orations.— (Boston Journal, May 31, 1882.)     
HENRY DRAPER. 
Prof. Henry Draper, sonof Dr. John W. Draper, died November 20, 1882, of pneumonia, 
resulting from a severe cold contracted while on a visit to the Rocky Mountains in Oc- 
tober. He was born in Prince Edward County, Va., March 7, 1837; but, his father re- 
moving soon after to New York, Henry received his early education in the public schools 
of that city. At the age of 15 he entered the academical department of the univer- 
sity, but did not graduate there. At the end of his sophomore year he entered the medi- 
cal department of the university, which his father had been prominent in establishing 
and from which the son took his medical degree in 1858. He at first thought of prac- 
tising medicine, and received an appointment on the medical staff of Bellevue Hospital, 
which he held for 16 months; he then decided to abandon practice and give himself to 
teaching. He was elected professor of physiology in the academical department ot 
the University of the City of New York in 1860 and in 1866 became professor of the same 
branch in the University Medical School; but, resigning this post in 1873, he taught ad- 
vanced analytical chemistry in the academical departmentof the institution. Prof. Henry 
Draper, with his father, represents one of the double stars in the firrfament of scientific 
celebrities, of which there is now a@ considerable catalogue. Inheriting not only his 
father’s genius but also his subjects of research, his early education, carefully superin- 
tended by his father, was shaped with a view to the pursuits to which his life was de- 
voted. His first scientific investigation, made at the age of 20 and embodied in his 
graduating thesis at the medical college, was on the functions of the spleen, and was 
illustrated by microscopic photography, an art then initsinfancy. Soon after receiving
-P-A-G-E-485
    
NEW YORK. 191 
his degree he went to Europe, and while there visited the widely known observatory of 
Lord Rosse and studied his celebrated colossal reflecting telescope. This led him to con- 
sider the problem of using reflecting telescopes for the purpose of photographing celestial 
objects. He constructed one of 15} inches aperture and with it took a photograph of the 
moon 50 inches in diameter, the largest ever made. He afterwards constructed an equa- 
torial telescope of 28 inches aperture, designed mainly to photograph the spectra of the 
stars. It was finished in 1872, after a long series of experiments, and was pronounced 
by President Barnard to be probably the most difficult and costly experiment in celestial 
chemistry ever made. Professor Draper was the first to obtain a photograph of the fixed 
lines in the spectra of stars, and he continued the work until he had obtained impressions 
of the spectra of more than 100 stars. 
When a commission was created by Congress for the purpose of observing the transit 
of Venus in 1874, Pxofessor Draper, was placed in charge of the photographic department. 
He spent much time in preparation, for which he declined to receive any compensation. 
So signal was the success of his disinterested exertions that the commissioners had a 
gold medal struck in his honor bearing the inscription in Latin ‘‘ He adds lustre to ances- 
tral glory.’ In 1878 he went to the Rocky Mountains to observe the total eclipse of the 
sun, and there successfully photographed the spectrum of the solar corona. For the 
Jast two or three years he has been much engaged in the difficult work of photographing 
nebule, and he startled the scientific world by the announcement that he had obtained 
a fine photograph of the great nebul in Orion and of its spectrum. Professor Draper was. 
not @ prolific author. He only published one book, but wrote much for the scientific 
periodicals, giving the results of his work. Probably his most important work was his 
discovery of oxygen in the sun. It was the result of great sagacity, experimental skill, 
and an immense amount of labor.— (Popular Science Monthly, January, 1883.)

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. \ 
For the State, the law provides a board of education and asuperintendentof public in- 
struction; for counties, boards of education and superintendents; for each district, a 
school committee of 3.

  NORTH CAROLINA, 193 
OTHER FEATURES OF ‘THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all youth 6 to 21 of either race.- They are sustained by 
the income of a State school fund; by at least three-fourths of the proceeds of a State and 
county pol] tax, which under the constitution must not exceed $2; and by an educational 
tax of 12} cents on the $100 of property and credits ip the State and 374 cents on every 
poll.*s:A special tax may be levied annually in each county if the beforementioned tax 
be insufficient to sustain at least one school in each district for 4 months. The State 
board of education apportions the school funds to the counties on the basis of school 
population, ascertained by an annual census, and the county boards to the districts on 
the same basis, specifying how much is apportioned to white and how much to colored 
schools, the funds for each being kept separate by the treasurer of the county boards. 
No branches are taught in the public schools except spelling, defining, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, grammar, and history of the State and of the United States. Teachers are 
examined by county superintendents, and if found qualified receive certificates valid 
for 1 year in the county where issued. Provision is made for holding teachers’ institutes 
in each county or in 2 or more counties combining, and when held the teachers in such 
county or counties are required to attend. Teachers are also required to make satisfac- 
tory reports to the district committees, the committees to the county superintendents, 
and they to the State superintendent. The schools for the two races are to be kept sep- 
arate and sectarian or political books are not to be used in the public schools.— (School 
laws, 1881.) 
GENERAL CONDITION. \ 
The condition of the public schools, as shown by the State report for 1881-’82, is that 
of transition from a very bad state of things to a better one, during which a full and sat- 
isfactory report can hardly be expected. Compared with 1880-’81 there was a decrease 
in white youth of school age and an increase in that of colored; a gain in enrolment of 
white youth, but in that of colored a loss of nearly three times the gain in the former; 
while in average daily attendance the decrease of colored youth was four times the in- 
crease of the whites. In districts there was an increase of 3 and in public school-houses 
of 146, the value of school property rising $147,229, while the free schools were fewer by 
354: 203 for whites and 151 for colored. As to teachers there was an increase of 364, 
of whom 105 were white women, 107 colored women, and 152 colored men, as against a 
decrease of 193 in white male teachers, or a net increase of 171 teachers. School ex- 
penditures, although less completely reported, increased $100,077. 
The above indicates the state of things following the improved school system author- 
ized by the law of 1881. 
Under the old system there had been no county supervision, no provision for teachers’ 
institutes or for adequate school funds. The new law provides for county superintend- 
ents, county teachers’ institutes, and an increase of taxes from 8} cents to 124 cents on 
$100 valuation of property, and also an increase of the poll tax. The State superintend- 
ent says that on assuming their office the county superintendents found the school sys- 
tem and the schoolsin a very bad condition; that, with the people, the school committees, 
and even the county boards, there was no properly directed interest; that the people 
demanded a division of districts into smaller ones, each one wanting the school near his 
house; that half of the districts were without school-houses or money to build them; 
that the county boards, yielding to the pressure of petitions, divided a district already too 
small into two, leaving each with funds barely sufficient to support schools four weeks 
with an ordinary teacher; that confusion reigned supreme and the enemies of public 
schools increased; and that the larger number of school-houses were in a dilapidated 
condition or were built without reference either to neatness of appearance or comfort. 
Although in an old community a new school system is of slow growth, the State super- 
intendent is hopeful that the needed reforms may be effected, at least after years of 
patient toil, with the new system improved as experience may suggest, « largely increased 
corps of well trained teachers from normal schools, and the more enlightened work of the 
county superintendents. Already under the guidance of the county superintendents many 
counties have been wisely redistricted, information has been given to the people, teachers 
have been improved, the best in the old system made better in the new and incompetent 
ones dropped from the rolls.— (State report.) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Wilmington reports the Tileston Kindergarten, opened in 1880, having 30 pupilsin tha 
principal school and 30 in a branchschool. The Kindergarten connected with the Char« 
Jotte Female Institute was discontinued in 1881. 
For full statistics of this class of schools reporting, see Table V of the appendix.

  194 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. \ 
LEGAL PROVISION. 
No special provision for city school systems is contained in the school law. Local of- 
ficers arrange for schools within their respective jurisdictions, graded schools in townships 
with 5,000 inhabitants being recognized and a tax for them of one-tenth of 1 per cent. on 
property and 30 cents on the poll authorized.— (School laws.) 
STATISTICS, 
Raleigh and Wilmington are the only cities in the State having in 1881-’82 over 7,500 
inhabitants, the minimum limit of cities the statistics of which are given in Table II of 
the appendix, Neither of these cities makes any return for 1881-’82, 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The State aids 10 normal schools, 5 of which are for colored teachers. Eight of these 
were established in 1881, 4 for whites and 4 for coloretl. The following make report 
for 1882: : 
The University Normal School, Chapel Hill (1877), held its usual summer session of 5 
weeks, with an enrolment of 352, under 13 instructors and 17 lecturers. There is no 
permanent faculty nor full course of study. State appropriation was $2,000; tuition 
is free.— (Return. ) 
Besides this school, the university offers a 2-year teachers’ course for young men, em- 
bracing not only all the studies required by law, but several others useful to the teacher.— 
(Catalogue. ) 
The State Colored Normal School, Fayetteville (1877), has a 6-year course, the first 3 
years of which are preparatory. It enrolled, in 1882, 123 pupils, under3 instructors, and 
graduated 1, who engaged in teaching. The State appropriated $2,000, making tuition 
free. Itslibrary contained 225 volumes, The increase in attendance was 12 per cent. over 
that of 1881. Since opening, 280 students have been admitted, of whom 39 haye com- 
pleted the full course of study and received certificates,— (Return, State report, and 
catalogue.) 
The following schools for whites, established in 1881, held summer sessions during 
June and July: 
The Elizabeth City State Normal School, Elizabeth City, with $720 State appropriation, 
had 60 students, under 1 instructor and 8 lecturers, with a model school. 
The Franklin Normal School, Franklin, with an appropriation of $500 from the State, 
of $100 from the county, and of $220 from the Peabody fund, had 127 students, under 5 
instructors, and a model school. 
The Newton Normal School, Newton, had an attendance of 200 students, under 3 in- 
structors and 7 lecturers, 2 model school, and a State appropriation of $500. 
Three of the 4 colored schools established in 1881 report by return for 1882, as follows: 
The Franklinton State Normal School for Colored Teachers, Franklinton, with $700 from 
the State, had 75 students, under 4 instructors and lecturers, 150 volumes in its library, 
and a model school. : 
The Colored Normal School, New Berne, with $500 from the State and $200 from the Pea- 
body fund, had 95 students, under 4 instructors and lecturers, and 400 volumes in library, 
but no model school. 
The State Colored Normal School, Salisbury, with $500 from the State and $50 from the 
county, had 65 students and 2 instructors, but no model school this year. 
The State superintendent, with the concurrence of the board of education, decided that 
the colored normal schools should continue their sessions as lang as the fynds would 
allow, which proved to be from 4 to 9 months, The colored students seemed to need in- 
struction more in the matter of the text book than in methods. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Whitin Normal Schoot, Lumberton, reports, for 1882, 80 pupils and 4 instructors, 
with 4-year courses and a model school. 
The normal department of Shaw University, Raleigh, had 6 instructors and 133 students. 
It is estimated that 1,000 of its graduates have engaged in teaching. It has a library of 
2,200 volumes and a model school. 
Zileston Normal School, Wilmington, sustained not by the American Unitarian Associa- 
tion, as was wrongly said in the report of 1881, but by Mrs. Mary Hemenway, of Boston, 
Mass., graduated 7 at its commencement, Jung, 1882, one:of whom has entered the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
  NORTH CAROLINA. 195 
Wilmington Normal School, under the care of the American Missionary Association, had 
244 students, under 7 teachers, including the principal. 
An academy was opened at Kinston during the year to prepare colored youth of either 
sex for teaching, so as to meet the coming demand for good teachers of their race. 
Graham Normal College, Graham, and St. Augustine’s Normal School, Raleigh, fur- 
nish no data for 1882. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Under the provisions of the law of 1881, 123 teachers’ institutes were held during 1881 
and 1882 in 58 counties, in whi « 2,260 white and 650 colored teachers were instructed, 
their usefulness being therebyinuch increased. Teachers’ associations were organized in 
many of the counties, and t ough them much information was given to the people. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS, 
The North Carolina E/:ucational Journal, the official organ of the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation, published mqithly at Chapel Hill, issued its first number January 15, 1881, 
and continues its regull rissues, giving to the teachers of the State valuable information. 
The Light-Housé an 1 Tileston Recorder, a monthly journal published at Wilmington 
by students in the Til/ston Normal School at that place, continues its regular issues, 
giving some general ¢iucational information, though mainly devoted to the interests 
of the normal school. _ 
The publication at Ri leigh of the North Carolina Teacher is announced; the paper is 
to be issued monthly, b\ yinning June, 1883, and will be devoted to progressive education 
in the State. =< 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
No general information as to high schools in the State has reached this Office. 
The North Carolina Educational Journal for 1882 mentions one for boys at Laurinburg, 
with an average attendance of 100, and others at Jonesboro’, Summerfield, Gilead, and 
Catawba. There seems to be an increasing interest in the establishment and work of 
graded schools, The Journal mentions this class of schools at Goldsboro’, Wilson, Frank- 
linton, High Point, Durham, Fayetteville, Raleigh, Salisbury, Greensboro’, and Johnson, 
with Edenton, Readville, New Berne, Louishurg, and Rocky Mount moying in this di- 
rection, the last haying raised $15,000 for the purpose. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools, such as business colleges, academies, and 
preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and IX of the appendix, and 
for asummary of the same, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of North Carolina, exclusively for young men, offers classical, philo- 
sophical, and scientific courses of 4 years each, which are pursued in subordinate col- 
leges, so called, each of which presents certain schools or studies. Its optional course 
provides for such students as in proper cases and under special conditions may choose 
studies out of the regular courses. Therearealso graduate courses leading to the degrees 
of PH. D., A. M., and M. s. There was an attendance for the year of 199 in the various 
departments.— (Catalogue. ) : 
Of the other 8 universities and colleges reported in 1880-81, only 6 report for 1881-’82. 
Biddle University, Charlotte, and Davidson College, Davidson College Post Office (Pres- 
byterian); Shaw University, Raleigh (Baptist); Weaverville College, Weaverville (non- 
sectarian), present classical and scientific courses of 4 years, and all, withthe exception 
of Shaw, preparatory courses, with music, French, and German. Biddle, organized for 
the instruction of colored male youth, has classical and English preparatory courses of 
3 years each. Rutherford College, Rutherford College (non-sectarian), admitting both 
sexes, arranges its studies under 6 schools, adding military drill and music. Shaw, 
organized for the instinction of both sexes of colored youth, gives normal, theological, 
medical, scientific, and musical instruction; while Trinity College, Trinity College (Meth- 
odist Episcopal South), arranges its whole course of instruction in 11 schools. Shaw 
reports an industrial department, in which a large class of young men are receiving 
instruction in carpentry and furniture making, while most of the young women receive

instruction in dressmaking and the domestic arts. Since its foundation in 1875 this 
institution has enrolled 947 students, 364 of whom were females; 699 were normal and 
214 theological students.— (Catalogues. ) ? 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
For statistics of this class of schools reporting for 1881-’82, see Table VIII of the 
appendix, and for a summary of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
The Estey Seminary building of the Shaw University is said to be the finest school 
edifice in the State and to have been the first erected of any considerable size devoted 
exclusively to the education of colored women. It has accommodations for 100 pupils 
and is named after Dea. Estey, of Brattleboro’, Vt., who, with his sons, contributed 
largely to the building and furnishing of the seminary.— (Catalogue. ) 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The scientific course of the State university, covering 4 years and leading to the degree 
of B. S., includes the studies that relate to the practical pursuits of life, especially agri- 
culture and the mechanic arts. A philosophical course of 4 years is also provided for 
those wishing to study only one ancient language, which may be either Latin or Greek; 
it leads to the degree of PH. B. For students whose time and means are limited there 
is an optional course by which they may obtain purely agricultural instruction in 
branches deemed of special value. A museum was soon to be opened, with model plows 
and other agricultural implements, including specimens of the productions of the various 
soils of the State.— (Catalogue. ) 
Biddle and Shaw Universities and Davidson College show scientific courses of 4 years, 
though differing in the studies required, while Trinity College has a course of 3 years. 
Weaversville has an undefined course as to time, but, like Shaw, offers one for those who 
wish to pursue English and scientific studies to the exclusion of the classics. Ruther- 
ford College in its independent arrangement includesa school of natural science.~—(Cat- 
alogues. ) 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological.— Biddle and Shaw Universities continue to give theological instruction, 
the former in a course covering 3 years, and the latter in one of 2 years for those who have 
graduated from the academical department, with an English course for those who have 
not completed their literary studies. In Trinity College the theological instruction 
heretofore noted seems to have been discontinued.— (Catalogues. ) 
For statistics of these departments reporting in 1882, see Table XI of the appendix, 
and for a summary of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.— The State University continues its legal instruction in a course requiring 2 
years of study, of 9 months each, on the completion of which the degree of bachelor of 
Jaws is conferred on such ‘students as pass a satisfactory examination. Trinity College, 
heretofore reporting a 3-year legal course, no longer shows any trace of it.— (Catalogue. ) 
Medical.— The medical school of the State University offers a full course of study, cov- 
ering 2 years, the sessions beginning and ending with those of the,other departments of 
the university.— (Catalogue. ) 
The medical department of Shaw University was opened for instruction in 1882 in 
two large buildings erected during the year, known as the Medical Dormitory and Leon- 
ard Medical Building, the latter on a beautiful site given by the State. This new de- 
ent is now provided for, and every effort will be used to make this school valuable 
to the colored people. Its course of study covers 3 years of five months each. It opens 
with 1 professor and 3 students, all with degrees in letters or science. .The property 
of the school is valued at $35,000.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Pharmacy.— The State university offers a course in pharmacy to extend over 2 sessions 
of 5 months each. Certificates of graduation are to be given to those who pass an ap- 
proved examination on all the studies of the course. Those who have had 3 years’ expe- 
rience as drug clerks, in addition to the above requirements, are to have a diploma and the 
degree of graduate of pharmacy.— (Catalogue. ) 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Raleigh, reports for the years 
1881 and 1882 196 inmates, 105 being deaf-mutes and 91 blind. Of this number 60 
were in the colored department, of whom 38 were deaf and 22 blind, this branch of the
-P-A-G-E-491

school being a mile from the main building. During the two years 3i°were admitted 
and 23 discharged. The State is said to have gathered children not only from good and 
poor homes, but from the haunts of vice, and it gave the institution $68,000 for the two 
years. The principal says that successful efforts were made to educate the inmates mor- 
ally, mentally, and physically. In the department for the blind there was instruction 
in school studies and industries; in that for the deaf, classes in signs and articulation. 
In the boys’ department, the shoe, broom, and mattress shops were operated success- 
fally, but machinery, the principal says, has so changed the business of shoe and broom 
making that most of these pupils who attempt to gain aliving by hand work at these 
trades will fail. The call is for land on which to teach them gardening andagriculture. 
For the females, besides the ordinary industries of sewing, &c., there is a cookery school, 
with a room fitted up with all the appointments of a well regulated kitchen. The re- 
port touches on the inexpediency of having the deaf and blind in the same institution, 
as there is no interest in common between them and can be no common system for their 
education.— (Report, 1882: ) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
The Orphan Asylum, Oxford, organized and managed by the State Grand Lodge of 
Masons, is for the education of indigent and friendless but promising orphans between 
8 and 12 years of age. There were 187 inmates, of whom 47 were admitted during the 
year. A large majority of those discharged during the 10 years of its work are prosper- 
ous and useful citizens. In addition to the main building, a new one for boys was built 
and farnished during the year, and another for their dining room was under contract. 
Receipts for the year, $14,452: $2,000 from the lodge, $5,000 from the State, and the 
rest from the people, the institution being indorsed by the Protestant denominations of 
the State. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
This body met at Chapel Hill, July 4, 1882, and was in session till the evening of the 
‘ith, George R. McNeill, president, in the chair. Hon. K. P. Battle delivered the ad- 
dress of welcome, which was responded to by the president. There were 11 members 
present and 7 were added. On the 5th the opening address was made by the president, 
which was followed by a discussion on ‘‘ The efficient superintendent,’’ opened by Prof. 
Newell and continued by several others. Superintendent Duckett read a paper on 
“Public schools a necessity,’ which was fully discussed. On the 6th a paper was 
read by Superintendent Smith on ‘‘ Our public schools and their critics,’’ said to have 
contained valuable information as to the school history of the State and excellent sug- 
gestions in the line of improvements. This paper led to an extended discussion. 
“Teachers’ institutes’? was then presented in a paper by B. F. Grady, and discussed 
at some length, followed by a report from each county superintendent of his year’s 
work. On the 7th several resolutions were passed looking to the work of the coming 
year and making the North Carolina Educational Journal the organ of the association, 
after which, officers for the ensuing year having been elected, the association adjourned. 
(North Carolina Educational Journal.) 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association held its annual session at Chapel Hill, July 7-8, 1882. But a brief’ 
account of this meeting is given. It was called to order by President G. T. Winston, wha 
delivered the opening address, giving his views of the common school system of the State. 
A large‘number of new members were enrolled. A resolution was passed that the asso- 
ciation urge the general assembly to pass a law giving the people the right of voting a 
tax for the establishment of graded schools or for a longer continuance of other publie 
schools in any town or district desiring the same. 
Officers for the ensuing year were elected; county superintendents were urged to or 
ganize county teachers’ associations and send delegates from them to the next annual 
meeting of the association, and a resolution was passed that the office of county superin- 
tendent is indispensable to the efficient working of the public school system.— (North 
Carolina Educational Journal.) 
STATE COLORED TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
An address was issued to the colored teachers of the State calling a convention to meet 
at Raleigh November 23, 1882, to organize a State Colored Teachers’ Association and 
to consider the merits of organization, the best methods of teaching and school govern- 
ment, educational advancement, harmony of sentiment, and unity of action. The fol- 
lowing gentlemen were engaged to attend and present the subjects assigned to them: 
Hon. J. C. Searborough, Necessity of organization; Prof. John Duckett, Public schools

institutes; Prof. H. M. Joseph, Teachers’ qualifications. No réport of this convention 
has reached this Office.— (North Carolina Educational Journal.) 
COUNTY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The information in regard to these associations shows an increasing interest in them. 
Brief notices appear in the Educational Journal of meetings in Stanly, Rowan, Wake, 
and Iredell Counties. The State Teachers’ Association at its last meeting urged the or- 
ganfation of them in every county in the State.

200 - REPORT OF: THE: COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For general supervision of the public schools,there is a State commissioner; under 
him are boards of education for city districts of the first class, city districts of the sec- 
ond class and village districts, township and special districts, and joint subdistricts. To 
test the qualifications of teachers there are boards of examiners for the State, for coun- 
ties, and for cities and villages.— (Laws of 1880.) 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools, free to all youth of school age (6-21), are sustained from the pro- 
ceeds of an annual tax of one mill on $1 of all taxable property when no rate is fixed 
by the legislature, and of 6 per cent. interest on an irreducible common school fund. 
State funds, to be used only in the payment of teachers, are apportioned by the State 
auditor to the several counties according to the latest enumeration of youth therein, 
the county auditor apportioning them to the districts and fractions of districts, Ex- 
penses for continuing schools, for, providing school-houses and sites, and all other con- 
tingent school expenses must be raised by a district tax not to exceed 7 mills on $1, 
except in Cincinnati, where the limit is 5 mills, and in Cleveland, 43 mills. Each 
board of education must establish a sufficient number of schools for the free education 
of all youth of school age within the district under its control, and, if deemed neces- 
sary, may open one or more high schools. Each township board must establish at least 
one school in every subdistrict under its control. District boards may establish separate 
schools for colored children; in cities and villages, may provide evening schools; and, in 
children’s homes, orphan asylums, and county infirmaries, may establish schools, for 
which teachers only are provided by the district. All children between the ages of 8 and 
14 must attend the public schools for at least 12 weeks in each school year, 6 of which 
must be consecutive, unless the child’s health, the needs of an indigent parent, brother, 
or sister, or the distance (2 miles or more) from the nearest school makes such attend- 
ance inexpedient, or the child’s previous acquirements or its instruction being other- 
wise provided for make it unnecessary. The employment of any childless than 14 years 
of age under control of a parent or guardian and not dependent on its own resources 
is prohibited, unless the child has attended school for“at least 12 weeks, nor shall it 
then be employed for more than 40 weeks unless exempted from compliance with the 
compulsory law. 
Each board determines the text books to'be used for three years without change in 
the schools under its control, and the studies to be pursued, all of which must be in Eng- 
lish, unless German is demanded by 75 freeholders who represent 40 pupils entitled to 
attend such schools. No person may be employed as a teacher in any common school 
who has not obtained a certificate of moral character and qualifications from an author- 
ized board of examiners, and, if employed, must present such certificate and the required 
report to receive pay. For district: libraries the law allows an appropriation from the 
contingent fund; for city districts, a tax of one-tenth of a mill on $1 taxable property, 
ee) in the city of Cleveland, where sit may be 2} tenths of a mill on $1.— (Laws of 
GENERAL +CONDITION. 
The statistical summary for 1881-’82 presents a pleasing contrast to the unfavorable 
report of the previous year. There is shown a well proportioned advance along the 
whole line, with the slight exception of a decrease of 595 in enrolment in colored schools 
and of 20 in the teachersin them. Beginning with an increase of 17,984 in school popu- 
lation, there was a gain of 11,881 in the average monthly enrolment and of 15,091 im the 
average daily attendance. While in township districts there was no change, the subdis- 
tricts in them increased by 60, andin city, village, and special districts there was an increase 
of 15 and of 10 in their district subdivisions. There was an increase of 29 school-houses 
and 453 school rooms. Ninety-six more school-houses were built than last year, at an 
increased expenditure of $474,189, the total value of school property increasing by a 
million and a half. In teachers permanently employed there was a gain of 363, while 
$2-was added to the average monthly pay of men and $1 to that of women. Thewhole 
receipts for school purposes were $634,455 greater than in 1880-’81, and the expenditures 
$687,293 greater. 
The problem of the advancement of the country schools still engaged the serious at- 
tention of the State commissioner. The difficulty of supplying competent teaches is 
due to the uncertain tenure of the teacher in these schools, where, in a majority of 
cases, a change is made every 3 months. A very suggestive comparison in the State re- 
port shows that it costs more by $2.46 per pupil to educate the children of Ohio than  
-P-A-G-E-495
  OHIO, 201 
those of Pennsylvania for the same time. With the same expense per pupil as in Penn- 
sylvania, Ohio would educate her pupils with $1,837,959 less than it now costs. Even 
leaving out the expense in cities, with their full system of grammar and high schools 
and their substantial and often costly buildings, it costs $1.10 more per pupil to keep 
up the country schools of Ohio 30 weeks than it costs the Pennsylvania system in both 
city and country for the same time. About the same proportion is shown by a com- 
parison with Indiana and Wisconsin. The commissioner repeats the recommendations 
of last year for new legislation: (1) to place the schools in each township under the 
management of a single board of education ; (2) to make some provision by which 
teachers of primary and grammar schools may secure the advantages of State certifi- 
cates; (3) to remove the disadvantage incurred by some localities from the formation of 
the best portions of a township into special districts.— (State report, 1882.) 
KINDERGARTEN. 
Thirteen schools of this class report for 1881-’82 468 pupils, under 32 conductors and 
assistants. For further information, see Table V of the appendix to this volume. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
Cities of 10,000 or more inhabitants have boards of education of 1 or 2 members for 
each ward, while cities of less than 10,000 inhabitants and villages have boards of 8 or 6 
members for the whole corporation, with annual change of one-third in either case. 
Cincinnati has a board consisting of 12 members at large and 25 others, representing as 
many wards, and Cleveland a board of 18 members, being 1 for each ward.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Akron had 10 school-houses, with 48 rooms for study, valued, with other school prop- 
erty, at $105,000. The public school enrolment comprised 58.6 per cent. of the youth of 
school age. Notwithstanding the existence of large factories and workshops, thé effi- 
ciency of school management is seen in the fact that 43.5 per cent. of the school pop- 
ulation was in average daily attendance; the percentage of the enrolment so attending 
was 71.22. 
Bellaire had 5 school buildings, valued, with other school property, at $75,000. The 
schools enrolled only 47.3 per cent. of the school population and had only 59.4 per cent. 
of the enrolment in average daily attendance. Fifty-six pupils were enrolled in the 
high school. 
Canton has 10 school buildings, with 47 rooms, valued, with other school property, at 
$80,000. Compared with the report for 1880~’81, there was an increase of 1,194 in

school. population, of 311 in enrolment, and of 155 in average daily attendance. The 
public schools enrolled 57 per cent. of the pupil youth, and retained 68 per cent. of the 
enrolment in average daily attendance. There were 70 pupils in the high school. A 
return reports a night school, with 158 students, and an estimated enrolment of 600 in 
private and parochial schools. 
Chillicothe provides 6 school buildings, with 53 rooms, valued, with other school prop- 
erty, at $150,000. ‘The statistics show 55 per cent. of the school population enrolled in 
the public schools and 77.5 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. In 
school population and attendance the city showed slight gains as compared with 1880-’81, 
decreasing expenditures. by $3,228. A return gives an estimated enrolment of 300 in 
private and parochial schools. 
Cincinnati had in 1881-’82 57 school buildings, with 594 rooms for study, valued, with 
other school property, at $2,000,000. There were 28 white and 6 colored district schools, 
4 white and 2 colored intermediate schools, 1 colored and 2 white high schools, besides 
intermediate departments in 12 district schools. In white district schools there was an 
enrolment of 26,561; in district schools for colored, 1,135; in intermediate schools for 
whites, 5,053; in same for colored, 180; in high schools for whites, 1,183, with 125 gradu- 
ates; in same for colored, 72 and 7 graduates; in the normal school, 43; in the school for 
deaf-mutes, 27; in night schools for whites, 3,469; in same for colored, 273; while in pri- 
vate and parochial schools, excluding Kindergiirten, business colleges, and higher insti- 
tions, there was an enrolment of 17,836. The results obtained in drawing, music, and 
penmanship are said to have been highly satisfactory. In the white distriet schools 
15,457, or 56 per cent. of the pupils, were taught German; in the intermediate, 1,850, or 
35 per cent.; in the high schools, 550, or 44 per cent.; in all, 17,857, or 52 per cent. of 
the white pupils enrolled in these schools. This instruction was given by 155 teachers 
ot German, at an additional cost of only $2.91 for each pupil taught. If to the enrol+ 
ment in day schools be addéd the 3,742 in night schools and the 17,836 in private and 
parochial schools, an approximate enrolment of 54,396 is obtained, the enrolment in 
Kindergiirten, business colleges, and higher institutions being omitted. The public 
schools, enrolling only 35 per cent. of the school population, had 81 per cent. of their en- 
rolment in average daily attendance. There was an increase of 6,168 in school, popu- 
lation during the year, to meet which anew school building was erected, said to be one 
of the finest school-houses in the city, and another one of 15 rooms was in process of 
completion. To 2 buildings 6 rooms each were added, and to 2 others 4 each. The 
custom of celebrating the birthdays of authors by reading essays on their lives and 
works and by reciting selections from their writings continued with increasing interest. 
The memorial days of Garfield, Longfellow, and Webster were among those most effect- 
ively celebrated. ‘‘ Arbor day’. was introduced into the schools in 1882 at the 
request of the American Forestry Congress, then in session in the city. Acting in 
the spirit of the governor’s proclamation calling on all the people of Ohio to devote 
April 27 to tree planting, the board of education dismissed the schools for 2 days, that 
teachers and pupils: might join in the work. For this purpose 6 acres were set apart 
and called the ‘‘ Authors’ Grove,’’ where each department of the schools planted a group 
of trees in memory of some author.— (State and city reports.) 
Cleveland had 43 school buildings, with 427 rooms for study, valued, with other school 
property, at $1,789,194. There seems to have been an effort to provide, as far as possible} 
for the large increase in school population over 1880-’81, for, with 6,515 more youth of 
school age, an increase of 2,154 in enrolment and of 2,961 in average daily attendance, 
there were erected 2 new school buildings, at a cost of $42,800, and 78 more teachers were 
employed, the aggregate expenditures increasing $42,550. The public schools below 
the normal were classed as high, grammar, and primary; they enrolled 46 per cent. 
of the school population and had 74 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attend- 
ance; they were in session 120 days. Vocal music and drawing were taught to all the 
pupils and 8,829 studied German. 
Columbus had 26 school buildings, with 174 rooms for study, valued, with other school 
property, at $781,784. During the year 1 new building was erected, costing $80,036. 
‘There were 89 primary and 52 grammar schools and 1 high school, all taught by 16 male 
and 150 female teachers. The high school enrolled 573, averaging 499, with an average 
daily attendance of 479; the grammar schools, with an enrolment of 2,409, an average of 
2,077, had 1,963 in average daily attendance; while the primary enrolled 5,451, averag- 
ing 4,384, and had 4,100 in average daily attendance. For colored youth of school age, 
numbering 605 in 1881, separate primary and grammar schools were formerly provided, 
but the graduates from these since 1874 have been admitted to the high school on equal 
terms with the whites. This was so much in accordance with public feeling that in 
February, 1882, the colored schools were closed and the pupils admitted to the white 
schools of all grades. White and colored youth now attend the same schools within the 
city limits. The statistics as compared with 1880-’81 show an increase of 662 in school

population, of 419 in enrolment, and of 439 in average daily attendance, requiring 13 ad- 
ditional teachers, and an additional expenditure of $82,761. The superintendent says 
that the fluctuation in attendance was less than it had been for several years. Schools 
were in session 195 days and enrolled 51 per cent. of the youth of legal age, having 78 
per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. . The estimated enrolment in 
private and parochial schools was 1,800, which, added to the enrolment in public schools, 
aoe per cent. of the youth of school age under instruction.— (State and city re- 
ports. 
Dayton had 14 school buildings, with 132 rooms for study, the public school prop- 
erty of the city being valued at $360,000. There were 1 high, 1 normal, 1 interme- 
diate, and 11 district schools, taught by 19 male and 116 female teachers. Instrue- 
tion in vocal music was given to all the pupils, in drawing to 5,192, and in German to 
1,711, special teachers being employed for music and for drawing. The high school 
numbered 214 pupils at the close of the year and graduated a class of 23 from its 4-year 
course, making the number of 493 during its history. Thete was a gain of 1,518 in 
school population, a loss of 304 in enrolment, and a gain of 39 in average daily attend- 
ance, while 5 more teachers were employed and an additional expenditure of $17,385 
was incurred. The public schools enrolled only 49 per cent. of the children of school 
age, but had 76 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. A return gives 
2,027 enrolled in private and parochial schools, which, added to the public school enrol- 
ment, shows 65 per cent. of the youth of pupil age under school instruction. The 4 
night schools, having been more completely organized than ever before, secured much 
more favorable results, the attendance consisting largely of Germans. In 2 of these 
schools in which the ordinary branches were taught there was an enrolment of 246; in 
the school for freehand drawing, an attendance of 325, and in the school for industrial 
drawing, 201, a total attendance of 772. The superintendent says that in these drawing 
schools there seems to be no abatement in the interest manifested by the public, with a 
very considerable increase of attendance in the industrial drawing school. The teachers 
employed by the board were of the highest skill.— (State and city reports. ) 
Fremont reports but slight changes compared with 1880-’81, having? school buildings, 
with 15 rooms for study, valued, with other school property, at $50,000.. With about 
the same attendance as last year, 6 more teachers were employed and $3,656 more ex- 
pended. Of the school population 47 per cent. were enrolled in the public schools, which 
held 65 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. Schools were in session 
190days. The high school closed the year with 52 students and graduated a class of 7 
young ladies, having had in all 127 graduates during its history.— (State report. ) 
Hamilton, with a gain of 139 in school population and a slight increase in attendance, 
shows 5 school buildings, with 35 rooms for study, the sameas in 1880-’81; school prop- 
erty was valued at $150,000. With one more teacher employed, there was areduction of 
$5,967 in expenditure. The schools were in session 200 days and registered only 41 per 
cent. of the youth of school age; but 75 per cent. of the enrolment was in average daily 
attendance. All the pupils were taught drawing and vocal music, and 858 German. 
The high school had 85 students at the close of the year and graduated 5. 
Jronton advanced a little as compared with 1880-81, except in enrolment, which was 
101 less, employing the same number of teachers and decreasing expenditures by $538. 
The schools were in session 180 days and enrolled 55 per cent. of the youth of pupil age, 
with 75 per cent. of the enrolment in average daily attendance. The high school num- 
bered 61 at the close of the year and graduated a class of 14. The report shows 8 school 
buildings, with 30 rooms, valued, with sites, &c., at $45,000.— (State report. ) 
Lima, expending for its public schools $5,358 more than in 1880-’81, had, as before, 2 
school buildings, with 25 rooms, valued, with sites, &c., at $100,000. The city employed 
1 more teacher, gained 348 in school population and 165 in enrolment, and lost 95 in daily 
attendance. Schools were in session 190 days and enrolled 57 per cent. of the youth of 
school age and had 70 per cent. of the enrolled in average daily attendance. There 
were 82 in the high school, which graduated 19. 
Mansfield shows a small advance throughout from 1880-’81. Schools were in session 
180 days, expenses increased by $1,797, and 6 buildings and other school property were 
valued at $150,000. The schools enrolled 67 per cent. of the school population. The 
high school numbered 99 at the close of the year, graduating 18. 
Newark reports 2 high, 12 grammar, 22 primary schools, and 1 colored school. For 
these 37 schools there are 7 school buildings, with 38 rooms for study and sittings for 
1,996. Schools were in session 190 days, enrolling 49 per cent. of the school population 
and holding 72 per cent. of the enrolled in daily attendance. With ah increase of 201 
in the youth of school age, there was a corresponding increase in attendance. The high 
scliool, in numbets, is said to have surpassed anything in its history, having 132 
students and graduating 16.— (State and city reports. ) 
Portsmouth, compared with 1880-’81, shows an increase of 200 if youth of school age 
aud of 747 in entolinent, arid a falling off of 364 in daily attendance. The enrolmen

reached 79 per cent. of the school population, while only 52 per cent. of the enrolled 
were held in daily attendance. The schools, which were in session 190 days, were taught 
in 6 school buildings, with 43 rooms for study, valued, with sites, &c., at $182,000. The 
high school numbered 74 at the close of the year, graduating 13. 
Sandusky had 9 school buildings, with 44 rooms for study, valued, with sites, &c., at 
$160,000. Compared with 1880-’81 there were small gains in school population and en- 
rolment, but a loss of 157 in daily attendance. Three more teachers were employed, 
while expenses were less by $528. Schools, which were in session 200 days, enrolled 41 
percent. of the youth of school age, holding 79 per cent. of the enrolment in daily attend- 
ance. The entire number enrolled studied drawing and 868 German. - The high school 
pupils numbered 93 at the close of the year, graduating 23. 
Springfield erected 1 new school building during the year at a cost of $20,113, making 
10 buildings, with 59 rooms for study, valued, with grounds, &c., at $110,560. It reports1 
highschool, with 122students, and 9 district schools, with 3,264, taugéat by 64 teachers, in- 
cluding 3 special teachers of music, writing, and drawing. Compared with 1880-81 there 
were gains of 970 in youth enumerated, of 252 in enrolment, and of 174 in daily attend- 
ance. Schools were in session 185 days and enrolled 46 per cent. of the enumeration, 
retaining 74 per cent. of enrolment in daily attendance. Instruction in drawing and 
vocal Eve was given in all the schools and in German to 363 pupils.— (State and city 
reports. 
Steubenville shows a falling off of 1,775 in the youth of school age during the year and 
some decrease in attendance, this last owing, it is said, to the presence of infectious dis- 
eases. There were 6 school buildings, valued, with grounds, &c., at $127,000. The want 
of new school buildingsisseverely felt. Schoolsareclassedas high, grammar, and primary, 
the last including a colored school. Schools were in session 200 days, enrolling 44 per 
cent. of the school population, with a fraction over 96 per cent. of the enrolled in daily 
attendance. A return gives 632 in private and parochial schools, which shows not 
quite 59 per cent. of the youth of school age under school instruction.— (State and city 
reports. 
TTigin hod 5 school buildings, with 25 rooms for study. Compared with 1880—’81 there 
was a loss of 184 in school population and a slight falling off in attendance, while 8 
more teachers were employed and $1,543 less expended. Schools were in session 200 
days, registered 41 per cent. of the children of school age, and had 72 per cent. of the 
enrolment in daily attendance. A return gives the valuation of school property at 
$75,000 and 700 pupils in private and parochial schools; this enrolment, with that of 
the public schools, leaves nearly 37 per cent. of the youth of school age unenrolled. 
Vocal music was taught to all the pupils, drawing to nearly all, and German to 245. The 
high school pupils numbered 64 at the close of the year, 8 graduating. 
Toledo rated its school property, including 23 school buildings, with 118 rooms for 
study, at $590,000. With an addition of 1,107 to the school population of 1880-’81, 
there were gains of 149 in enrolment, of 639 in average daily attendance, and of 10 
teachers, with an additional expenditure of $27,135. Of the 120 public schools, 2 were 
high, 6 grammar, 19 intermediate, 33 secondary, 53 primary, and 7 ungraded, all under 
14 male and 126 female teachers. The schools were in session 200 days and registered 
42 per cent. of the youth of school age, holding 72 per cent. of the enrolment in daily 
attendance. A return gives 3,000 enrolled in private and parochial schools, which, 
added to that in public schools, shows 58 per cent. of the school population enrolled. 
A table in the city report shows that 963 per cent. of the enrolment were under 16 
and over 62 per cent. under 11 years of age. Instruction in vocal music was given to 
all the pupils, in drawing to nearly all, and in German to 1,649. Out of the 4,116 
examined, 3,193 were promoted. The 2 high schools enrolled 186 and had 146 in daily 
attendance. To meet the large increase in school population, the board made extensive 
additions to the accommodations and had a building on an original plan in process of 
erection.— (State and city reports. ) 
Youngstown, to provide for the large increase in school population and attendance, 
during the year erected 2 school buildings, making 8 in all, with 47 rooms for study, the 
entire school property being rated at $250,000. The studies reported indicate the usual 
primary, grammar, and high schools. Schools were in session 190 days and registered 
47 per cent. of the youth of school age, having 67 per cent. of the enrolment in daily 
attendance. The high school registered 89 at the close of the year, graduating 14. 
Zanesville during the year erected 1 school-house, costing $6,361, making in all 18 
school buildings, with 67 rooms. With about the same attendance as the previous year, 
the same number of teachers were employed, while expenditures were more by $18,864. 
The schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, were in session 200 days, showing 
an enrolment of 49 per cent. of the children of school age and 74.4 per cent. of the 
enrolled in daily attendance. 
Summarizing the statistics of the 22 city systems thus briefly noticed, it appears that 
44 per cent. of their school population were enrolled in the schools and 33 per éent.

were in average daily attendance; but it would be unjust to consider these figures as 
discreditable to the city systems of Ohio, since the comprehensive school age of that State, 
extending most freely the opportunities of instruction to all unmarried persons under 
21, is apt to give an erroneous impression when thé results of the school system are rep- 
resented by figures. Nevertheless the attendance,is not what the State intended it 
should be when enacting the lawas to compulsory attendance, nor what the superintend- 
ent desired to accomplish by his suggestion on page 77 of the 1880 edition of the school, 
laws. In fact, as to percentage of enrolment and of daily attendance the cities as a whole 
were exactly where they were the year before, but as they increased in population it may 
properly be inferred that, though relatively no more pupils were taught, absolutely more 
schooling was done, a fact corroborated by the considerable additions to the teaching 
force, the accommodations, and necessarily to the expenditures. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The State makes no provision for the education of teachers, but normal schools are 
found in connection with the public school systems of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, 
Columbus, and Steubenville. 
The Cincinnati schqol was opened in 1868, adding a German department in 1871. 
During the last session 43 were enrolled in theschool, of whom 15 were Germans, and 39 
graduated, of whom12wereGermans. Ofthe 43 admitted, 37 were from the high schools. 
During the last session the highest standard of qualification since its organization was 
attained. The principal urges the advisability of lengthening the. course. to 1} or 2 
years and of enlarging the practice department so as to include 4 schools instead of 2, 
which ee he thinks, should not be from the lowest grades of the system.— (City 
report. 
The Cleveland Training School reported 5 instructors and 41 female students, 34 of 
whom graduated and engaged in teaching. The full course of study is 1 year of 40 
weeks. There is a model school attached. 
The Dayton Normal and Training School had 4 instructors, with 13 students, and 
graduated 12, 9 of whom engaged in teaching. The full course is 1 year.. Provision is 
made for the most thorough examination of candidates for graduation, it being regarded 
of supreme importance that no one shall be graduated unless thought capable of becom- 
ing a successful teacher. There is a model school attached. : 
The normal school in Columbus held its 28 sessions on Saturdays, with an enrolment 
of 97 and an average daily attendance of 71. This ‘school is open to such members of 
the junior and senior classes in the high school as intend to become teachers and to those 
already teaching who desire further instruction. 
Steubenville, by adding one year to the high school instruction, established during the 
year a normal and training school to supply trained teachers for its schools. The first 
class consisted of 13 young ladies. * 
OTHER NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
The private normal schools reporting for 1882 are (1) Northwestern Ohio Normal School, 
Ada, with 1,420 normal students in a 3-year course and 498 others, in all 1,918, under 
36 instructors, graduating 65; (2) Ashland College Normal Training School, Ashland, hay- 
ing a 4-year courseand open to both sexes; (3) Ohio Central Normal and Kindergarten Train-

TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
An institute at the expense of the institute fund may be held in any county where not less 
than 30 regular teachers shall declare in writing their intention to attend, the managing

committee to enter into bond in twice the amount in the county treasury for such insti- 
tute and the institute to be held not less than four days. The institute fund is derived 
from fees of 50 cents from each applicant for examination as a teacher in the county; in- 
stead of turning the money into thecounty treasury, however, city districts may retain in 
their own treasuries the fees collected from applicants for examination and with the 
amount holda district institute; the city failing to hold the annual institute, the money 
goes to the county. 
During the year 95 institutes were held, with an aggregate attendance of 12,078, at a 
cost of $19,980, a gain of 10 institutes and of 1,406 in attendance over 1881. Five in- 
stitutes were in session 4 days each; 62, 5 days; while 28 continued 10 and over; 3 reach- 
ing 15 and 3 others 20 days, all under 425 instructors. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Teachers’ Guide, Mallet Creek, continued through 1882, expiring with the De- 
cember numbér. The Ohio Educational Monthly, Salem, continues to be the organ of the 
State Teachers’ Association, furnishing valuable information as to methods of instruc- 
tion and government and also as to the progress of education in the State and elsewhere, 
being now in its twenty-third volume, The Vis-A-Vis continues to be published weekly 
at the: State Institution for Deaf-Mutes, Columbus, and was in 1882 in its fifteenth 
volume. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. . 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
High school statistics for 1882 show 600 rooms in use, an increase of 25 over 1881; 
546 men and 254 women teaching, a total of 800, an increase of 26; an enrolment of 
29,372, a loss of 567; and an average daily attendance of 20,902, a lossof 63. There were 
32 more male and 6 fewer female teachers. The average monthly pay of men in town- 
ship district high schools was increased from $53 to $55, while that of women was re- 
duced from $36 to $28. In city, village, and special districts the pay of men was reduced 
from $69 to $57, and that of women from $55 to $54. Of the enrolled there were 3,264 
more females than males, and of the daily attendants, 3,246 more. The high schools of 
the State, as reported, graduated 1,125.— (State report.) 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private academic schools, preparatory schools, or preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables VI, VI, and IX, and for business colleges, Table IV of the 
appendix; for summaries of the same, corresponding tables in the report of the Commis- 
sioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The Ohio State University, Columbus, reported for 1881~82 a large increase in students 
and equipment and a reorganization of the curriculum. Itis open alike to both sexes and 
offers a 2-year preparatory course, affording a fair opportunity for pupils of the common and 
high schools to enter the university. There are two literary courses and one in science, 
each of 4 years, called general courses, and four special courses, also of 4 years each, 
Military drill is required of all male students unless excused on reasonable grounds. The 
whole number in actual attendance was 340, a gain of 60 over 1880-’81. More accom- 
modations and instructors were needed. With an appropriation from the State of 
$20,000, a chemical laboratory building was nearly completed. Provision was alsomade 
for the immediate erection of three faculty residences, at an aggregate cost of $15,124. 
The year began under a new organization of the various departments: instead of the 
previous Classification of regular, special, preparatory, and unclassified students, came 4 
schools, viz: the school of arts and philosophy, including those studies which enter into 
the course leading to the degrees of B. A. and PH. B.; the school of science, including 
studies which enter into the course leading to B.S.; the school of engineering, including 
the studies which enter into the course leading to the degrees of civil engineer, mechan- 
ical engineer, and mining engineer; and the school of agriculture, including the studies 
leading to the degree of bachelor of agriculture. The total value of endowment and 
property exceeds $1,000,000.— (Catalogue. ) 
The University of Cincinnati consists of three departments, viz: the school of design, or 
art department, organized in 1871; the academic, or department of literature and science, 
organized in 1873; and the observatory, or astronomical department, 1875. The endow- 
ment consists of an estate left by Charles McMicken, increased by donations from the 
Cincinnati Astronomical Society and individuals. It reports a faculty of 14 instructors 
in the academic and astronomical departments and 8in the school of design. The course 
 
-P-A-G-E-501
    \ OHIO. 207 
in this last seems to occupy 5 years; the other regular courses cover 4 years each, with 
special ones of 1 year and graduate courses of 1 year leading to the degree of M. A., 
M. S8C., or M. L., a similar course of 2 years leading to PH. D. The number of stu- 
dents for the year was 374, of whom 91 were academic, 281 were in the school of design, 
and 2 were in the observatory.— (Catalogue. ) 
} Ohio University, Athens, shows classical and philosophical preparatory courses of 3 
years each, #llowed by classical and philosophical courses of 4 years each, the last dif- 
fering from the classical course in substituting French and German for Greek, thus al- 
lowing time for considerable attention to be given to the English language in the junior 
year. Extensive improvements were made during the year in facilities for instruction, 
and a new building, containing an assembly room and halls for the literary societies, was 
in course of erection. There were 72 in the preparatory department, under 3 instructors, 
and 32 in the classical and philosophical courses, there being in the last an equal num- 
ber of males and females.— (Catalogue and return.) 
) Of the remaining universities and colleges, 34 reported for 1881-’82. The Miami 
Valley College has, since the last report, become extinct, while Richmond College, 
which had been discontinued for some years, was reopened in 1881. All, but the He- 
brew Union, St. Xavier, Kenyon, Marietta, Richmond, and Geneva Colleges and Cap- 
ital, Denison, and Urbana Universities, admit both sexes; all, except the University of 
Cincinnati, show preparatory courses of 2, 3, or 4 years; all have the usual classical 
courses of 4 years; all but 7, scientific courses of 4 years; while 8 have philosophical 
courses of the same length. Twelve show commercial courses; 18, arrangements for 
normal instruction, previously mentioned under Training of Teachers; while 13, to be 
mentioned under Professional Instruction, have departments of theology; 1, a depart- 
ment of law; and 2, departments of medicine. St. Xavier, University of Cincinnati, 
Oberlin, and Ohio Wesleyan continue their 4-year literary courses, that in the last 
being only for ladies. Five institutions provide elective and select courses, while all 
give instruction in either German, French, music, or drawing and painting.— (Catalogues 
and, returns. ) 
) For statistics of these institutions reporting, see Table IX of the appendix, and for a 
summary of them, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FQR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Besides the institutions above mentioned, which admit both sexes, there are 10 other 
colleges designed especially for the superior instruction of young women. 
) The Cincinnati Wesleyan College follows its primary and preparatory courses of 3 and 
4 years with classical and scientific courses of 4 years each and confers the degree of A. B, 
on the completion of the classical and scientific courses and that of A. M. on the com- 
pletion of a graduate course of 2 years. In 1882 it opened a regular military department. 
) Mount Auburn Young Ladies’ Institute, Cincinnati, aims to complete young ladies’ edu- 
cation by giving systematic ingtruction in domestic art and science to the senior class, 
‘There was an aggregate of 146 professors and instructors and 325 preparatory and 637 
collegiate students, with 1,151 in all departments. All, except the Western Female 
Seminary, begin with preparatory and some also with primary courses of 3 and 4 years, 
while all have collegiate courses of 4 years each. Some offer special courses and all give 
instruction in music, drawing, painting, and modern languages. 
For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix, and a summary of it in the report of 
the Commissioner preceding. \ 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The Ohia State University, Columbus, continues its 4 distinct courses of technical study 
in addition to the regular scientific course of 4 years, viz: in agriculture, and in civil, 
mining, and mechanical engineering, each of 4 years, the first year being the freshman 
year of the scientific course. In the department of horticulture and botany instruction 
is given in lectures connected with laboratory practice and field work. The annual 
course of lectures to farmers given in January of this year was well attended and the 
interest of former years fully sustained. (Catalogne. ) : 
Otterbein College discontinued its old scientific course in 1881 and adopted a philosophi- 
cal course, enlarged so as to be equal in extent to the classical, substituting French and 
German for Greek. 
The Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, at Cincinnati, organized in 1881, embraces the depart- 
ment of science and arts, sections of mechanics and engineering, of chemistry and-phys- 
ics, and a school of design.   
 
-P-A-G-E-502
208 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Scientific courses of 4 years are offered by 29 other universities and colleges, the Uni- 
versity of Cincinnati adding a course of 4 years in civil engineering, leading to the de- 
gree of C. E. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological.—'The schools of theology existing purely as such and having 3-year courses 
are Lane Theological Seminary, Cincinnati (Presbyterian); the Union Biblical Seminary, 
Dayton (United Brethren) ; the Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, 
Gambier; and the United Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Xenia. St. Charles Bor- 
romeo, Carthagena, reports a course of 8 to 10 years, including studiesin philosophy and 
classics; and St. Mary’s Theological Seminary, Cleveland, a course of 5 years; bothare 
Roman Catholic. : 
The following have theological courses of 3 years: German Wallace College, Berea, 
(Methodist Episcopal); Capital University, Columbus (Evangelical Lutheran); Oberlin 
College, Oberlin (Congregational); and Urbana University, Urbana (New Church). Wil- 
perforce University, Wilberforce (African Methodist Episcopal), for colored students, has 
a course of 4 years, partly literary. Wittenberg College, Springfield (Evangelical Luth- 
eran), and Heidelberg College, Tiffin (Reformed Presbyterian), have courses of 2 years 
each; while Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware (Methodist Episcopal), and Hiram Col- 
lege, Hiram (Disciples), show biblical studies in connection with college courses. The 
2-year and 3-year courses are meant to follow a collegiate or high school training. — 
(Catalogues and returns. ) . 
For statistics of theological schools and departments reporting, see Table XI of the 
appendix, and a summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Legal.— The law school of the Cincinnati College had 127 students in its 2-year course 
for 1881-’82. There appears no advance in requirements for admission or graduation. 
For admission to the junior class, satisfactory evidence of a regular academic education 
is sufficient; to the senior class, a satisfactory examination in the studies of the junior 
year and a certification that the applicant has studied law for one year; for the degree 
of LL. B., regular admission to the senior class, attendance on the full course of senior ~ 
lectures, and a satisfactory examination. Graduates having the necessary qualifications 
of age and citizenship are admitted to the bar of Ohio without further examination. A 
graduate course is added whenever a sufficient number call for it.— (Catalogue. ) 
The catalogue of Wilberforce University for 1881-’82 indicates the discontinuance of 
its law department. 
Medical.— The following are the only regular medical schools! reporting for 1881~’82: 
The Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery, with 13 professors and 1 demonstrato: 
the Medical College of Ohio, with 10 professors and 15 assistants; and the Miami Medi- 
cal College, with 11 professors and 8 assistants, all in Cincinnati; the Columbus Medi- 
ca] College, with 12 professors and 3 assistants, and the Starling Medical College, with 
14 professors and 1 demonstrator, both in Columbus. 
The medical department of the Western Reserve University, Cleveland, a combination 
of the Cleveland Medical College and the medical department of Wooster University, 
was opened for students in September, 1881, the two bringing to the new institution a 
new faculty of 16 instructors. 
For graduation, all required the usual 3-year course of study under a physician, in- 
cluding 2 regular lecture courses of 20 weeks each year in those at Cincinnati and of 24 in 
those at Columbus and Cleveland, the last of which courses must be in the college con- 
ferring the degree. All, except Columbus Medical College, offer a 3-year graded course, 
but do not require it. To induce students to pursue it, the Miami Medical College will 
demand fees for but 2 years of those who complete the 3-year course.. The Cincinnati 
College of Medicine and Surgery announces the plan of giving special operative courses 
as a new and important feature of the spring session, having for its object the training of 
physicians and advanced students in making physical examinations of patients and per- 
forming operations. 
The Eclectic Medical Institute, Cincinnati, with 8 professors and a demonstrator, had 
courses of 19 and 20 weeks yearly and recommended but did not require a 3-year graded 
course, For graduation, students must have studied medicine 3 years and attended 2 
full courses of lectures, the last of which must have been in this school. * 
- The Physio-Medical Institute, Cincinnati, with 12 professors and 2 assistants, requires 
3 full years of study and 2 full courses of lectures of 20 weeks annually. 
The Pulte Medical College, Cincinnati (homeopathic), with 10 professors and 3 assist- 
ants, and the Homeopathic Hospital College, Cleveland, with 10 professors and 3 assist- 
ants—each open to both sexes— continued to require 3 years of study,‘including at- 
tendance on 2-year lecture courses, the last of which must be in the college conferring 
1Two other medical schools, the Toledo Medical College,Toledo, and Northwestern Ohio Medical 
College, Toledo, were in process of organization for 1883,

the degree. Both offer a 3-year graded course, but do not require it. The Hospital 
College offers special courses of instruction in those branches which cannot be conyven- 
iently taught in the regular course. 
The Cincinnati College of Pharmacy requires attendance on 2 full courses of lectures in 
a regular college of pharmacy (the last in this college), an experience of 4 years with a 
qualified pharmacist, and a written examination. 
‘The Ohio College of Dental Surgery requires attendance on 2 courses of lectures in a 
dental or medical college (the last in this school), a written thesis, a specimen case of 
artificial dentistry, and a satisfactory examination. 
The 6 regular colleges reported. for 1881—’82 900 matriculates and 676 graduates; the 
1 eclectic, 272 matriculates and 100 graduates; the Physio-Medical Institute, 36 matric- 
ulates and 12 graduates; the 2 homeopathic, 208 matriculates and 60 graduates; total, 
1,416 matriculates and 848 graduates. 
For further statistics of schools of medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, see Table XIII 
of the appendix, and for summaries of them, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
CLEVELAND EDUCATIONAL BUREAU. 
This bureau, which is especially to benefit the working classes, provides lectures and 
publishes pamphlets and books for the people, embodying a large amount of useful in- 
formation, of which 119,200 had been distributed. The work of the bureau for 1881, 
under the direction of C. A. Bolton, was so successful that the institution was made per- 
manent and arrangements were made for the second season. During the first season 
the average evening attendance was from 2,500 to 4,000, the total receipts $5,000. Dur- 
ing the second season, in 1882, the average attendance was 4,000 and receipts over $8,000. 
Among the lecturers were Joseph Cook, John B. Gough, and Governor St. John. Gen- 
eral Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education, was present at a meeting and de- 
clared that no such work had been done anywhere else in the United States. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Columbus, for 1882 reported 
513 different pupils, of whom 60 were in school for the first time, and 24 graduated, 
fairly equipped, it is said, for the duties of life; making 1,945 who had received instruc- 
tion since the opening of the institution. Its property was valued at $500,000, includ- 
ing a library of 2,000 volumes. Articulation and lip reading were taught, there being 
82 semi-mutes in theschool. There was an increased interest in the arrangement of the 
industries taught so as best to fit the pupils to take their places as skilled and success- 
ful workmen. The report advises discretion in the selection of trades. Of the 4 now 
offered, carpentry and shoemaking should be taught to those from the rural towns, as 
in them there will always be a demand for such labor, while those learning printing and 
bookbinding must find their work in the larger towns. It was urged that tailoring be 
added, especially in the interest of the girls. 
Ata meeting of the Ohio Deaf-Mute Alumni Association plans were set on foot by the 
mutes themselves for the establishment of a home for aged and infirm mutes. 
In the Cincinnati Day School for Deaf-Mutes, in charge of the city board of education, 
the enrolment was 27 and average daily attendance 22, under 2 teachers. The falling 
off from the previous year was due to the action of the legislature, which provided only 
for the payment of the teachers; previously a portion of the money appropriated for the 
school had been used to support its pupils for the 5 school days of the week. 
The Ohio Institution for the Education of the Blind, Columbus, shows for 1882 a total 
enrolment of 226, an average attendance of 176, and 28 new pupils. Instruction was 
given in the common and some of the higher English branches, in vocal and instrumental 
music, in piano tuning, and such other industries as are taught in like institutions. 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Ohio Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Columbus, suffered during the year for 
want of room, owing to the fire in 1881, which consumed the central part of the main 
building. It admits children from 6 to 15 years of age and instructs them in the com- 
mon school branches. During the year there were 612 inmates, 5 being new ones. The 
completion of the buildings in process of construction it was hoped would increase the 
efficiency of the institution. 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Boys’ Reform School is located on a farm of 1,210 acres near Lancaster, on which. 
there were 80 acres of vineyard, 8,000 peach trees, 30 acres of garden and nursery, and 
400 acres under general tillage. Besides the main building, which is 161 feet long and 
145  
-P-A-G-E-504
  210 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
3 stories high above the basement, there are family buildings, arranged around the main 
building and named after the rivers of the State. On the spacious grounds are numer- 
ous other buildings, 8 of which are shops for as many trades. ‘The first 10 boys received 
were from the Cincinnati House of Retuge in 1858, since which there had been received 
3,717 boys. In 1882 the average number in the school was 499, of whom 196 received 
the highest badge, 168 were on leave of absence, 19 were apprenticed, and 9 had employ- 
ments found for them. The superintendent says that of 45 per cent. released a large 
number were doing well and promised to become good citizens.— (Annual report.) 
The House of Refuge and Correction, for boys, Toledo, had 237 inmates during the year, 
and 731 since opening. 
The other institutions of this class heretofore reporting were the Industrial Schooland 
Home, Cleveland; Yoledo Industrial School; Girls’ Industrial Home, Delaware; Cincinnati 
House of Refuge; and the House of Refuge and Correction, Cleveland. All these schools 
give school, industrial, and religious training. 
EDUCATION IN ART. 
The School of Design in the University of Cincinnati, the Woman’s Art Museum Associa- 
tion, and the School of Design in the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, all at Cincinnati, the 
Columbus Art School, and the Toledo University of Arts and Trades give instruction in the 
various forms of art. The School of Design in the University of Cincinnati, beginning 
in 1868 with 1‘teacher and 30 students, entered upon a thoroughly graded course of in- 
struction in the various departments in 1880-’81, showing in 1881-’82 a faculty of 7, 
with 300 pupils, most of whom were females; in wood engraving all were girls. 
EDUCATION IN MUSIC. 
Scientific musical instruction is reported to be given in the College of Music of Cin- 
cinnati, the Cincinnati College of Music, Cleveland College of Music, and Oberlin Con- 
servatory of Music, Oberlin College, which last has a course of 3 years for the theory 
of music and from 3 to 5 years for the various forms of practice. This enrolled for 
1881-82 classes of 75 young men and 312 young women. Statistics of the other schools 
are wanting for that year, but it is hoped that they may be obtained for 1882-83. 
Another school heard of favorably is Dana’s Musical Institute, Warren, Ohio. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The Ohio Teachers’ Association held its thirty-third annual meeting at Niagara Falls, 
N. Y., July 5, 6, and 7, 1882. The superintendents’ section was called to order by 
George W. Walker. J. M. Goodspeed, president of the section, give the inaugural ad- 
dress, urging teachers to exert their influence in favor of legislation for a good school 
system, and William Hoover, of Dayton, read a paper on ‘‘ A rational course in math- 
ematics,’’ full of matter that cannot be well condensed. 
The general association was called to order by George W. Walker. President J. J. 
Burns delivered the inaugural address on ‘‘The evolution of a common school master;’’ 
Mrs. D. L. Williatis, of Delaware, Ohio, tead a paper on ‘‘ Young teachers and their 
calling,’’ followed by one on the same subject by Miss R. P. Cook, of Gallipolis, Ohio, 
both excellent and practical. These papers were discussed at some length and with 
much useful suggestion as to studies and methods. W. W. Ross, of Fremont, Ohio, 
read a long and admirable paper on instruction in history —local, biographical, and gen- 
eral—with information as to books for tse in such instruction, as well as to the lessons 
to be drawn from the study of history. These papers, with the inaugural addresses and 
a very appropriate memorial address by W. W. Venable, of Cincinnati, on the death of 
Hon. William Downs Henkle, a former State school commissioner and long editor of 
The Educational Monthly, occupied the sessions of the association. Of Mr. Henkle 
there may be found a brief biography in the report from this Bureau for 1881, page 209. 
OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Union Teachers’ Association of Trumbull and Portage Counties met December 
16, 1882, at Windham, with an excellent program, which was well carried out. O. F. 
Haymaker discussed industrial education. 
The Auglaize County Teachers’ Association held its first quarterly meeting at Wapa- 
koneta November 10. Papers were.read on ‘‘The dignity of the profession,” ‘‘The 
scholar’s mission,”’ and. ‘‘ Practical education.’? 
The Eastern Ohio Teachers’ Association held its twelfth annual meeting at Steuben- 
ville December 1 and 2. The program is said to have been good, the papers and discus- 
sions spirited, and the attendance large. Commissioner De Wolf discussed the question 
“Ts our American school system doing what it may for the interest of the public?”
-P-A-G-E-505
OHIO. i 211 
The Northeastern Ohio Teachers’ Association held its annual meeting at Cleveland 
December 9. Though the attendance was not as large as usual, the meeting is said to 
have been one of interest and profit. Superintendent Hinsdale, of Cleveland, discussed. 
the subject of American history in the public schools; Sebastian Thomas, of Lodi, in- 
dustrial training in German schools, a topic which awakened much interest. 
The Southwestern Ohio Teachers’ Association held its last session at Middletown 
April 22. A very fine paper is said to have been read by Mr. A. T. Wiles, of Newport, 
Ky., on “‘A course of study for public schools.”? 
The Southeastern Ohio Teachers’ Association met at Gallipolis April 28 and 29, but 
no account of the meeting has come to hand. 
OHIO COLLEGE ASSOCIATION. 
This association, begun about 20 years ago, is composed of the ‘‘ presidents and pro- 
fessors of the colleges in the State of Ohio” (constitution, article 3). The governor 
of the State, the commissioner of common schools, and the president of the: State 
Teachers’ Association ate members ex officio. After about a dozen years of peaceful 
life, it was thought necessary to determine what is a college in the State of Ohio. The 
association knew that no other body could make this definition as well as itself. It was 
entirely, in the view of its members, a matter of definition. After a year or two of con- 
sultation, upon the report of a judicious committee, it was resolved that certain named 
institutions, 15 in number, were the colleges in the State of Ohio. There might be 
other institutions which the State officers or the courts of law might call colleges, or 
even universities, but those named by the association were held to be the only ones in 
Ohio that were such in fact. Two others have since been added to the list, making 17. 
Nearly every year some institution presents a claim to membership, but fails of recog- 
nition. There has been talk of appointing a committee to investigate and revise the list, 
but no action has been taken. 
At one time the association adopted minimum courses of study for degrees in the col- 
leges connected with it; but having no power to enforce these they have become mere 
indications of a proper standard without any binding force.— (Letter from a member of 
the association. ) 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
DR. JOHN PRATT. 
Rey. John Pratt, D. D., founder of Denison University, died suddenly at Granville 
January 4, 1882, in the eighty-second year of his age. He was born in Connecticut, 
graduated at Brown University in 1827, and was the first president of the Baptist College 
at Granville, established in 1831 as Granville Literary and Theological Institution, 
made Granville College in 1832, and entitled to be called Denison. University in 
1856. He was professor of ancient languages there from 1837 to 1859, and then retired 
to private life, having given 28 years of untiring, self sacrificing toil to the educational 
and religious interests of his adopted State and of the college with which he was iden- 
tified. He is said to have been born a teacher and bred a scholar, true, quick, and 
keen, with marvellous power to awaken the dormant energies of pupils and to develop 
their ability for independent thought. Asa teacher of Greek and Latin he was re- 
puted to be of remarkably high rank, with few equals and perhaps no superiors when 
in his prime. 
DR. WILLIAM H. MUSSEY. 
Dr. William H. Mussey, of Cincinnati, was one of the most distinguished and public 
spirited citizens of that city. He was born in Hanover, N. H., September 30, 1818, 
studied medicine in the Ohio Medical College, and graduated in 1848. He subsequently 
studied 18 months in Paris, and upon returning to this country settled in Cincinnati, 
where he made a specialty of general surgery. He was vice president of the American 
Medical Association in 1864 and afterward vice president of the Ohio State Medical 
Association. He also held various eminent positions in hospitals and colleges. He was

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
For the general administration of public school affairs there is a State superintendent 
of public instruction, elected quadriennially by the people. He, the governor, and the 
secretary of state constitute a State board of education. The local officers are county 
superintendents of common schools, elected biennially by the voters of the county; dis- 
trict boards of three directors, elected for three years; and a district clerk, elected for one 
year.
-P-A-G-E-507
  OREGON, 213 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public school moneys are derived from a State school fund, from a county tax of 4 mills 
on $1, and from a tax which district meetings, legally called, have the power to levy on 
all the real and personal property in their districts. District meetings may also make 
any necessary appropriations for the support of schools. Only districts where schools 
have been taught three months are entitled to their proportion of the school fund; this 
restriction, however, is not to apply to a district until the fourth year of its existence. 
The State superintendent must report to the legislature biennially and county super- 
intendents must report to the State superintendent annually, or be liable to removal; 
they must also hold quarterly examinations, and applicants rated number 1 at such ex- 
aminations receive certificates good for two years; those rated number 2 receive certifi- 
cates for six months. Life diplomas and State certificates, the latter for six years, are 
given on examination by the State board of education, both being subject to revocation 
by the board, which also grants certificates of the same force as those granted by county 
superintendents. High schools must be maintained in districts containing 1,000 youth 
of school age. In districts containing 10,000 inhabitants, upon petition of 100 residents, 
one or more of the common schools is to be taught in the German language. Any tax- 
paying citizen of the State who is 21 years of age is entitled to vote at any school meeting 
held in the district in which he or she resides. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The report for 1881~’82 indicates progress in all but two items, graded schools and 
the salary of women teaching, in which the reductions were trivial. The State super- 
intendent says the greatest need of the schools is a more thoroughly trained class of 
teachers. To secure better supervision also, an increase of salary is recommended for 
county superintendents. A longer period of school during the year in the county dis- 
tricts is said to be necessary, as in 300 districts out of 1,026 in the State reporting 
the schools were taught but 3 months, or 60 days, during the year. The superintendent 
therefore recommends that the minimum school term entitling districts to their share of 
the school fund be 6 months instead of 3. He favors also an amendment to the law 
which shall require the levy of a State school tax of 2 mills on the dollar. 
‘ 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF PORTLAND. 
OFFICERS. 
The interests of the public schools of Portland are in charge of a board of 3 directors, 
aclerk, and a city superintendent. 
STATISTICS AND ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
With an estimated population of 25,000 the superintendent reported the total number 
of youth of school age in 1881~’82 to be 5,314, including colored and 126 Chinese. Of 
this number 3,130 were enrolled in the public schools, with an average daily attendance 
of 2,166. The number of cases of corporal punishment was 96; of suspension, 6. The 
percentage of tardiness was reported the same as last year. ‘The schools were taught 200 
days by 5 men and 51 women. During the year extensive additions were made to the 
accommodations and the superintendent declares that no school room in the city could 
be classed as poor. The receipts for all school purposes were $86,245; the expenditures, 
$118,106. There were 72 pupils graduated in 1882 from the grammar schools, over 65 
of whom entered the high school. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The Oregon State Normal School, Monmouth, organized in 1882 and made free to 62 
State students, offers a subnormal or elementary course of a year, preparatory to the 
regular normal course, which covers 2 years. The latter includes not only the science 
and history of education, school methods, hygiene of the school room, school law, &c., 
but also mathematics, natural and mental science, English language and literature, 
rhetoric, elocution, music, and book-keeping. Beyond this there is a 2-year course of 
collegiate studies for such as may desire to prepare for higher work. There is also a 
commercial course for students preparing for business. Undertaking so much at the 
outset, the danger is that it may become rather a second rate college than a first rate nor- 
mal school. Officers and teachers in the first year, 9; pupils, 104, without distinction of 
normal from others. 
Ashland College and Normal School, Ashland, like the preceding formerly a private enter- 
prise, with it, by actof the legislature of 1882, was madea State normal school. It offers
-P-A-G-E-508
  214 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
a 3-year normal course, covering 40 weeks each year, with a commercial and a college pre- paratory course, music, and penmanship. Its normal students have an opportunity for 
practice teaching in a primary and preparatory school. Teachers for the first year of its 
recognition by the State, 6; pupils in normal department, 21, besides 49 in the training 
school and 53 others. 
The collegiate department of the University of Oregon, Eugene City, furnished for 1882 a 
3-year normal course of English studies to a class of 10 students. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
McMinnville College, McMinnville, and Willamette University, Salem, in their prepara- 
tory departments offered normalinstruction, the former in a well arranged teachers’ course 
of 2 years and the latter in one of 3 years. Santiam Academy, Lebanon, and Wasco In- 
dependent Academy, The Dalles, also offered like instruction. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State superintendent is required by law to hold a teachers’ institute in each judi- 
cial district annually, as well as a State institute at some central point. For the year 
1881~’S2 there were 20 institutes held, attended by 648 teachers, 7 districts not report- 
ing. Teachers are required to attend all institutes held in the counties in which they 
reside, and for non-attendance without a good excuse the county superintendent may 
lower the grade or revoke the certificate of such teacher. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In districts containing 1,000 persons 4 to 20 years of age, the law requires high schools 
to be maintained at least 6 months in each year, but the State report gives no information 
regarding such schools. The city superintendent of Portland reported 201 pupils in 
the high school of that city, of whom 30 graduated: from a 4-year language course, 12; 
and from a 3-year English course, 18. Of the pupils 121 were girls; there was nota 
case of tardiness during the year. The only punishment inflicted consisted of 3 suspen- 
sions. . 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private secondary schools and preparatory departments of colleges 
reporting, see Tables VI and IX of the appendix, and summaries of them in the report 
of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Oregon, Eugene City, in the sixth year of its existence in 1881-’82, 
continued its preparatory, classical, scientific, and normal courses, the preparatory of 1 
year for the normal course and of 2 for the others, the classical and scientific collegiate 
of 4 years each, and the normal of 3 years. The scientific course differs from the classical 
mainly in substituting French, German, and mathematics for Latinand Greek. Butthe 
collegiate arrangements are still comparatively in their infancy. At least 1 free scholar- 
ship is allowed to each county, and it may have another for each member and joint 
member of the legislature to which the county is entitled. There appear to have been 
72 free students holding such scholarships, with 71 other students, 143 in all, in what is 
called the collegiate department, which included not only 72 college students proper, 
but also 10 normal students and 61 classical and scientific preparatory; 74 English pre- 
paratory students, not counted as collegiate, made a total of 217, all under 7 professors. 
Corvallis College, Corvallis; Pacific University, Forest Grove; Blue Mountain Univer- 
sity, La Grande; McMinnville College, McMinnville; Christian College, Monmouth; 
Philomath College, Philomath, and Willamette University, Salem, have preparatory de- 
partments, as well as classical and scientific courses of 4 years, except Pacific University, 
which makes its scientific course 3 years. It has also a 3-year ladies’ course. The 
studies of Corvallis College are divided into 7 schools, tliat of mathematics covering 4 
years, the others of undefined duration. Philomath gives a 4-year ladies’ course; Chris- 
tian, Philomath, and Willamette offer business courses; all three, with Blue Mountain, 
give instruction in drawing, painting, and music. For statistics of these institutions, 
see Table IX. is 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
All the above institutions are open to young women, Willamette University having a 
well organized woman’s college, with a lady dean.
-P-A-G-E-509
  OREGON. 215 
St, Helen’s Hall, Portland, for girls only, presented for the year courses in collegiate 
studies ocenpying 4 years. Latin and the modern languages were taught, as well as 
music, drawing, and painting. For statistics, see Table VIII of the appendix. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
In addition to the scientific courses before noted an opportunity is given in theschools 
of engineering and agriculture at Corvallis College for the study of these sciences, the 
former offering instruction in drawing, descriptive geometry, and the general principles 
of civil engineering; the latter, in analysis of soils, modes of drainage, methods of pre- 
paring farm buildings, as well as in stock raising, fruit culture, &c. Graduates from 
these schools are entitled to the degree of B.S. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
The College of Medicine, a department of Willamette University, located at Portland, 
is the only professional school reporting for the year 1881-’82. The required course 
of study is 2 years of 20 weeks each year and an optional preliminary course of 4 weeks’ 
duration annually. A 3-year graded course is recommended but not required. For 
admission a preliminary examination is required of applicants who are not graduates of 
a college, academy, or high school, and for graduation the student must have attended 
2 fall courses of lectures, have completed 3 years of study, have gone through a course of 
practical anatomy, and have passed a satisfactory final examination. The college in 
1881~82 had a faculty of 11; 29 students were matriculated and 9 graduated.— (Cata- 
logue.) 
     
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Oregon School for Deaf-Mutes, Salem, is a State institution under the management 
of a board of 9 directors. There were 42 pupils enrolled in 1881 and 1882, representing 
12 counties in the State; average attendance, 26. Instruction in the English branches 
was given (manual method) by 3 teachers, 1 of them a deaf-mute. The school was 
occupying rented buildings, and consequently had no shops for industrial training, while 
other needed advantages for comfort and instruction were still wanting. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Oregon Institute for the Blind, Salem, which was suspended in 1878, is to be re- 
opened in 1883, the legislature in 1882 having made an appropriation of $8,000 for its 
support. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
Mr. W. S. Ladd, a banker in Portland, has given the State $20,000 for the erection of 
a reform school and will pay all the expenses of maintaining it. 
INSTRUCTION OF INDIANS. 
The statistics for 1882 show a school population of 906 at the 5 United States Indian 
agencies in the State. Although there were school accommodations for 340 pupils, the 
average daily attendance was only 172. The school at Warm Springs agency was taught 
11 months, those at Klamath and Siletz 10, and at Grand Ronde 5, at a total cost to the 
Government of $16,612. There were 381 Indians who could read, 40 having learned 
during the year. They were taught housekeeping, sewing, carpentry, and gardening, 
as well as common school studies, by 19 teachers. 
The report from the Training School for Indian Youth, at Forest Grove, gives an at- 
tendance of 54 boys and 37 girls. The instruction was the same as that given at the 
agencies, blacksmithing, shoemaking, and farming being added. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association held its annual session at Salem, August 21-23, 1882, 
State Superintendent Powell presiding. The convention was well attended, though the 
number of teachers present was not given. Among the many interesting subjects was one 
presented by Dr. Fowler, of New York, advocating more thorough educational work. He 
recommended the old-fashioned drill course of mathematics, Latin, and Greek, and ad- 
vised students aspiring to a future life of usefulness to take a full course. The subject of 
physical geography was treated in an interesting manner with simple illustrations, and
-P-A-G-E-510
216 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
was followed by ,‘¢Education and the state.’? An excellent paper, entitled ‘‘ Necessity 
for better teachers and how to:securé them, ’? advocated normal schools supported by public 
funds; educational journals, as‘a valuable means of improvement to the reading teacher; 
and the encouragement of teachers by better pay, as those vocations which pay best usually 
attract the best material, and, while millions might be spent on normal schools, their 
graduates will not remain teachers unless paid to do so. « The subjects of ‘‘ Teachers’ ex- 
aminations,”’ ‘‘Science in school,’’ and ‘Relation of common schools to colleges’? were 
also discussed, after which the association adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The public schools of the State are under the general supervision of a State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, with 2 deputies; local supervision is secured through 
county superintendents, one for each county, and through school directors in independent 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
  218 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
school districts within the county, 6 for each district. In consolidated districts (cities 
or boroughs) there are directors in each ward to look after school property and buildings 
and the collection and disbursement of taxes in that ward, with a board of controllers 
composed of all of these directors for all other school matters of the city or borough. 
Women may hold any of these offices. The State superintendent is appointed by the 
governor, the senate concurring, every fourth year, and may be removed for sufiicient 
cause by the same functionary at any time; county superintendents may be changed 
every third year; one-third of the directors in any district, every year. Philadelphia, 
Pittsburgh, and some other places, under special charters, vary somewhat from these 
arrangements. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all children 6-21 years of age, of whatever race or color, 
residing in a district in which they are taught. To support the system the State con- 
tributes $1,000,000 yearly and requires the levy of an annual tax in each school district, 
which shall not exceed 13 mills on the dollar for instruction and as much more for build- 
ings. The sessions of the schools must cover from 5to 10 months yearly. School teach- 
ers must have certificates of qualification from some recognized school officer and must 
report monthly to the directors under whom they serve; these directors, annually, to 
their county superintendent; he to the State superintendent, who, from the city, county, 
_and other reports, prepares for the legislature a condensed statement of free school educa- 
tion for the year, adding information as to academies and colleges that have had aid at 
one time or another from the State. Ten normal schools under State direction continue 
to receive State aid, as do 2 schools for the deaf, 1 for the blind, and 1 for the feeble- 
minded; while graded schools, night schools, and city schools for the deaf come in for 
their share of the annual State appropriation. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State report for 1881-’82 indicates fair progress, From the lack of an annual 
census of children of school age, the proportion of enrolment to the number entitled to 
instruction cannot be told; but, with 13,596 more pupils in the public schools and not 
less than 9,000 additional attending academies and other private schools, it is not unlikely 
that even pace was kept with the growth of school population. Accordingly, Super- 
intendent Higbee estimates that only about 9,883 more youth than previously were 
without some form of schooling. At almostevery point, indeed, there is a gain: '7 more 
school districts; 348 more: free schools; 555 more schools graded; not including Phila- 
delphia, 119 more buildings for free schools, 108 more rated as first class, and 849 more 
supplied with good school furniture, as well as a considerable increase of teachers who had. 
either had 5 years’ experience or had been trained to some extent in the State normal 
schools. Ifthe statistics of the schools of Philadelphia were added where wanting to those 
above, the case would appear better still, as there the school buildings are among the best 
in the State, the teachers well trained in excellent city normal classes, and the appliances 
for instruction generally superior to those elsewhere. Almost the only thing that seems 
to be wanting to attain higher success is better pay for teachers; as the superintendent 
shows, the average pay of teachers in 1882 was only a little more than $200 yearly, not 
enough, certainly, to secure permanence in school work on the part of the class of teachers 
most to be desired. 
KINDERGARTEN, 
For the statistics and location of about 30 schools of this class in Pennsylvania, see 
Table V of the appendix; and for a summary of their statistics, a corresponding table 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
The Sub-Primary School Association of Philadelphia is reported to have established, 
from October, 1879, to March, 1882, in connection with ward associations in that city, 
11 free Kindergiirten, sufficing for the instruction of 405 children. Others have been 
added since that date. The school term is from the first Monday in September to July 1. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
The school government of cities is treated tinder the heading State School System, 
Officers. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh continued, under special laws, to have boards of 
education independent of the ward boards. 
Any city of over 5,000 inhabitants may, by vote of directors, elect a school superin- 
tendent of skill and experience as a teacher, and 36 cities and boroughs have such super- 
intendents.

School accommodations were increased by making additions to several of the buildings, 
nearly all of which are new, constructed of brick, and in the modern style of archi- 
tecture. Few cities, it is claimed, are better provided with school-houses than Alle- 
gheny. The year is reported as one of substantial progress. Schools were in session 196 
days. The enrolment in private and parochial schools was 3,000.— (State and city re- 
ports and return.) 
Allentown hada high school with a 3-year course, 9 school buildings with 3,700 sittings, 
and her entire school property was valued at $450,000. The attendance suffered from 
the prevalence of smallpox, and yet the enrolment was increased by 725. Of the 57 
teachers employed 30 were graduates of the city high school, 3 of a State normal 
school, and 2 held State certificates. A new brick building, with 4 large rooms, to be 
supplied, like all the others, with the most approved furniture, was nearing completion. 
Schools were in séssion 190 days.— (State report and city return.) 
Altoona had school sittings for 3,010 and school property valued at $101,260. Com- 
pared with 1880-’81, enrolment increased 72. The best school building had but 4 
rooms and is poorly heated and ventilated, and from want of room 5 schools of the 
lowest grades held half day sessions for some part of the year. During the last 8 years 
the school population had increased 60 per cent., while there had been no increase in 
the assessed valuation in that time. Schools were in session 187 days. An enrolment 
of 900 in private and parochial schools was reported.— (State report and city return.) 
Bradford in 7 years has increased its school population more than twelvefold and 
the number of its schools in proportion. Within the last 2 years it has erected 3 school 
buildings and enlarged another, thus providing for 13 new schools without burdening 
the district with debt or impairing its credit. In 1881-’82 there were 4 school build- 
ings, with 21 rooms. An increase of 337 in enrolment and of 358 in daily attendance 
was reported. A uniform salary of $50 a month was paid in all grades below the high, 
thus securing teachers of experience and culture, the best being selected for the primary 
grades. Schools were in session 219 days. Private and parochial schools enrolled 400, 
(State report and city return.) 
Carbondale had 8 school buildings, the entire school property being valued at $25,200. _

220 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
There was a decrease of 121 in enrolment. During the two years covered by the last 
report an effort was made to relieve the crowded condition of the primary schools by 
enlarging some of the buildings. The courses of study and grading were rearranged to 
give a course of 7 years below the high school. Schools were taught 190days. Private 
and parochial schools enrolled 198.— (State report and city return.) 
Chester had 10 school buildings, with 2,400 sittings, and rated them, with other school 
property, at$111,000. Attendance was well sustained, with slight gains. The principal 
change reported is the merging of the colored schools into those for whites without any 
troublesome results. More school room was needed and a new building was soon to be 
added. Schools were taught195days. There were 300in private and parochial schools.— 
(State report and city return.) 7 
Columbia in 1881-82 had 3 school buildings, valued, with other property, at $28,000. 
The addition during the year of a new one, with 2 rooms, elegantly furnished and scien- 
tifically heated and ventilated, fully met the wants of the school population. Instead 
of the falling off in attendance reported in 1880-’81 there was an increase of 32 in enrol- 
ment. The schools were all furnished with charts and maps. A public school library, 
begun in 1862 with a donation of $500, had grown to be one of the largest district school 
libraries in theState. Schools werein session 194 days.— (State report and city return.) 
Danville gives an increase of 42 in enrolment and school property valued at $60,000. 
Easton reported for its 49 public schools an improved classification and better methods 
of instruction. The examinations inaugurated as tests of school work presented a grati- 
fying exhibit of faithful teaching and intelligent acquisition. The indications of healthy 
growth were said to be unmistakable. The teachers employed gave proof of professional 
skill. A weekly teachers’ institute, with a normal class attached, was well attended, but 
enrolment shows a slight falling off from the previous year.— (State report.) 
The Erie public school system has enjoyed remarkable growth from an endeavor tokeep 
abreast of the increase of school population. While the increase of the entire population 
during the last decade was 42 per cent., the enrolment of its schools was 75 per cent. 
There were 16 school buildings, with 4,800 sittings, valued at $320,700. Among these 
are 8 fine structures built since 1870. The attendance of i880-’81 was sustained, the 
enrolment being only 24 less, The experiment adopted two years ago of carrying some 
of the natural science topics of the high school into the lower grades through talks of 
the high school teachers had proved advantageous in making the relations between the 
different grades more intimate and thus securing better results. The study of German 
is open to all grades. A mute school is sustained, in which articulation is successfully 
taught. Schools were in session 190 days. There were 2,000 enrolled in private and 
parochial schools.— (State report and city return.) 
Harrisburg had in 1881-82 21 school buildings, with 5,701 sittings, valued at $330,973. 
There was a gain of 128 in enrolment over 1880-’81. Improvements were seen in much 
of the work done in all the grades. While the teachers were faithful, many had never 
enjoyed any special training, and a number had but a limited experience. The high 
schools were more efficient than ever before. Schools were in session 197 days. Private 
and parochial schools enrolled 450,— (State report and city return.) 
Johnstown in 1881-’82 opened its public schools for the first time as city schools, they 
having been separated from the jurisdiction of the county. The rapid increase of schools, 
which numbered 30 in 1881-82, an increase of 3 over 1880-81, with an increased at- 
tendance overany previous year, necessitated the appointment of a superintendent, under 
whose care a new course of study was being matured. A new high school building, 
said to be the finest and most suitably arranged of any school building in the county, 
was built at a cost of $21,000; a high school was then organized, with an attendance of 
45 and a course of 3 years. The change in the management is said to have awakened 
public interest in the schools. School property was valued at $100,000.— (State report 
and city return.) 
Lancaster reported for 1881-’82 school property rated at $204,000. Enrolment gained 
290 over the previous year. The number of daily absences was 15 per cent. of the aver- 
age monthly enrolment. There was one more school, with two more teachers, than in 
1880-81. ‘The superintendent says that the schools are advancingin theextent and thor- 
oughness of their instruction; that the program outlined lastyear embraces an unusually 
good course of study for all the grades below the high school; that there is instruction in 
more practical and scientific subjects; that a city teachers’ institute is held, with instruc- 
tion in the art of teaching; and that a teachers’ library of professional works has been 
established. There were 1,000 enrolled in private and parochial schools.— (State report 
and city return.) 
Lebanon had in 1881~’82 8 school buildings, valued at $75,200. While the statistics 
show a decrease of 20 in enrolment, the report indicates a gradual advance in several re- 
spects. The superintendent is changing the practice of employing young and inexperi- 
enced teachers for the primary classes. Moral culture is fostered as a valuable part of

education. Schools were in session 187 days. There were 350 in private and parochial 
schools.— (State report and city return.) 
McKeesport reported in 1881-’82 its first year under a city superintendent. An effort 
was made to bring all the schools under a uniform course of study. There was an in- 
crease of 5 in schools and teachers over the previous year, with a gain of 117 in enrol- 
ment. Of the 4 school buildings, 1 was erected and oceupied during the year. It is 3 
stories high, has 10 rooms, with the conveniences of a first class school building and most 
approved furniture, costing in all $30,000. A high school, with a 3-year course, was or- 
ganized during the year, and drawing was successfully introduced into all the schools. 
Meadville, in 1881-82 also making its first report under a city superintendent, had 5 
school buildings, with 1,830 sittings, valued at $95,000. The average daily attendance 
was lessened by diphtheria. With the aid of teachers awake to the necessities of the 
hour and with professional work at weekly institutes, the superintendent thinks he 
will be able to make the transition from the old to the new with little friction. The 
high school has furnished most of the successful and accomplished teachers of the city 
and adjoining towns.— (State report and city return.) 
New Castze reported for 1881-’82 the erection of a new first class school building of 8 
rooms. Compared with 1880-’81 enrolment fell off 89. The high school, at first op- 
posed, had come to be regarded as an educational necessity. 
Norristown reports 6 fine school buildings, valued at $159,200, but a gain of only 7 in 
enrolment. Sickness was the principal cause of absence. Monthly teachers’ institutes 
were attended with interest and profit. Drawing was taught in all the grades with good 
results. In the high school much interest was taken in an association for the study of 
natural history, called the Agassiz Association. Moral training received attention as 
part of the school work. Schools were taught 200 days and 300 pupils were enrolled in 
private and parochial schools.— (State report and city return.) 
Philadelphia reports for 1882 38 more schools, as many more normally trained teachers, 
and $60,114 more expended than the preceding year, yet had 2,251 fewer pupils in 
average attendance and 491 fewer than in 1881 on the rolls. The average pay of teachers 
was reduced, in the case of men, $36.22 a month; in that of women, $6.05 a month. In 
consequence of the falling off in attendance 10 teachers were dismissed. 
The normal class of the city high school for young men and the excellent city normal 
school for young women were continued, preparing all teachers needed for new schools 
or for vacancies in older ones. Drawing and vocal music received attention as before, 
with a view to training teachers and pupils. Instruction in the elements of several use- 
ful industries was given by Mr. Charles G. Leland to teachers and pupils from the dif- 
ferent ward schools at a central city school; and, under the influence of the Philadelphia 
Public Education Association, instruction in sewing was made a part of the regular train- 
ing in the normal school. This association also interested itself effectively in an effort 
to induce the city board of education to obtain for the city schools what they had long 
needed: the supervision of a skilled superintendent, with at least one assistant. After 
a protracted and careful consideration of the subject the board decided, April 11, 1882, 
that skilled specialists in the science of education were necessary to superintend and su- 
pervise the schools, and that an amount of money sufficient to begin the organization of 
a board of superintendents should be included in the estimate of expenses for 1883. 
The city councils assented and appropriated $15,000 to begin the organization of such a 
board, which has been since begun by the election of a superintendent and one assist- 
ant. The ground for this action appears in the fact that in 1882 there were in the city 
normal and high schools 1,539 scholars; in grammar schools, 16,124; in intermediate or 
“secondary ’’ schools, 28,433; in primary, 57,606; and in evening schools, 12,190. Ef- 
fective supervision of over 500 schools, with more than 2,200 teachers and 115,000 pu- 
pils, could hardly have been possible for a central board and ward boards composed of 
men extensively engaged in business during the ordinary school hours, and it seems 
amazing that such a system should have been continued to so late a dayin the second 
city of the union. 
The evening schools above referred to comprised 23 for men and boys, 12 for women 
and girls, and 9 for both boys and girls, making 44 in all. Of this number 7 were for 
colored pupils, 1 was for German and English studies combined, and 1 a school for arti- 
sans actually engaged in mechanical pursuits and seeking better qualifications for their 
work. The instruction in this included geometry, mensuration, penmanship, arithme- 
tic, natural philosophy, and chemistry. The pupils in this school numbered 227. The 
session for 1882 covered 9 weeks, from October 16 to December 21, against 10 weeks 
the year before; another session of 2 months, covering January and February, 1883, was 
to follow this.— (State and city reports, &c.) 
Pittsburgh had, in 1881—’82, 56 school buildings, valued, with furniture, at $2,000,000. 
The prevalence of smallpox reduced the enrolment 851 from 1880-’81. Night schools 
were open 60 evenings, under 41 instructors and with an average attendance of 826, at

a cost of $5.52 per student. The central high school had academic, normal, and com- 
mercial departments, with an aggregate attendance for the year of 253 and 3 graduate stu- 
dents. In the academic department there were 13 instructors and 31 pupils. A class of 
30 graduated, two-thirds of whom were girls, nearly all preparing to be teachers in the 
city. German and mechanical and freehand drawing were taught by special teachers. 
Inthe normal department there were 11 instructors and 44 students, of whom 23 graduated. 
The diploma of this school is, by law, equivalent to a professional certificate. The 
commercial department, with 8 instructors and 2 assistants, completed its first year with 
178 students and a graduating class of 34. Teachers’ meetings were well attended and 
much interest is said to have been taken in the class drills in the several branches of 
school study. Vocal music was made a school study and taught by the regular 
teachers. The rapid growth of the city made new school buildings and additions an 
almost yearly necessity. In the ‘‘East End’’ the increase of average attendance was 
160 per cent. in 13 years; that in ‘‘South Side,’ 50 per cent. in 9 years. The increase 
of accommodations in 188182, at an expense of $29,353, did not keep pace with the 
increased attendance. In all the new parts of the city there was a demand for more 
school room.— (City and State reports. ) ; 
Pottsville reported 49 public schools in 13 school-houses, with 2,500 sittings, valued at 
$200,000, Within the year there was added 1 new school building. The enrolment 
increased 139, and daily attendance 9. The high school had a well graded course of 3 
years. Schools were in session 200 days. Private and parochial schools enrolled 200. 
(State report and city return. ) 
Reading claims that its schools are better than their reputation and that most of the 
teachers are doing good work. All except 2 of the school buildings were in good con- 
dition, well furnished, and well arranged as to ventilation and light. One 2-story build- 
ing, with 4 rooms, was erected during the year, and said to be, like all the other new ones, 
first class. Two others were needed. Enrolment shows an increase of 925 and daily 
attendance, of 449. 
Scranton includes among its public schools 1 for deaf-mutes. During the last 2 years 
4 new school buildings were erected and 2 others enlarged, adding 1,100 sittings, ata 
cost of $17,777, and making in all 30school buildings, valued, with other school property, 
at $325,000. Slight gains were made in enrolment and daily attendance, and 18 more 
teachers were employed, perhaps from more frequent change. Besides improved furni- 
ture and apparatus, 20 cabinet organs were placed in the schools. Vocal music was 
added to the regular studies and taught in all thegrades by aspecial teacher. Drawing, 
too, was taught in all the grades below the high school. Evening schools were open 
during the 3 winter months, with an average attendance of 1,075, taught by 46 teachers. 
Schools were taught 220days. Privateand parochial schools enrolled 2,000.— (State report 
and city return. ) 
Shamokin shows 6 school buildings, with 1,860 sittings, valued at $50,000. With 2 
more teachers than in 1880-’81, there was a lossof 110inenrolment. During the last 2 
years 5 new primary schools were established. All the school rooms were furnished with 
approved desks and seats and 17 with fine furniture. A first class building was soon to 
be erected on a site already purchased. A new feature introduced consisted of having 
the children in all the grades memorize choice thoughts from some of the best authors. 
The primary schools were receiving the special attention of the board, as requiring the 
rarest skill in teachers. Some of the best were employed for them and wages were paid 
in proportion to experience. Schools were in session 181 days. The superintendent 
reports 2 years of substantial progress. There were 420 in private and parochial schools.— 
(State report and city return.) 
Shenandoah had 4 school buildings, rated, with other property, at $61,000. There wasa 
gain of 2 teachers, of 99 in enrolment, and of 63 inaverage attendance. Somesubstantial 
progress was made inschool buildings. There wasmarked progressin primary work. The 
half day system was adopted in the first grade primary schools and was in the hands of the 
best teaching talent. The general condition of the schools was said to be highly satis« 
factory. They were in session 184 days.— (State report and return.) 
Titusville shows an increase of 216 in enrolment and of 54 in average attendance, re- 
taining nearly 71 per cent. of enrolment in actual attendance, notwithstanding the preva- 
lence of smallpox. The general condition of the schools was better than in 1881. Less 
machine work was done and more of training children to think. 
Wilkes-Barre reports the total statistics of 3 districts within the city limits. There 
were 16 school buildings, valued, with other property, at $181,872. In addition to the 
nearly 100 per cent. increase of attendance reported for 1880-’81, there was still a gain 
on that of 229 in enrolment, with the addition of 6 schools, 6 teachers, and an increase 
of $10,873 in expenditures. Schools were taught 190 days. There were 1,400 in pri- 
vate and parochial schools.— (State report and city return.) 
Williamsport shows 25 school buildings, with 3,485 sittings, valued at $144,325. En- 
rolment gained 57. The course of study and statistics of the high schools show the or-

dinary grade of studies, with an enrolment for the year of 122 and average attendance 
of 103. The schools during the session of 9 months are said to have been prosperous. 
Private and parochial schools enrolled 1,200.— (State report and city return.) 
York sustained 50 public schools (with a course of study covering 12 years, giving to the 
highschool 4 years), and 1 evening school; had 10 school buildings, with 2, 600sittings, rated 
at $140,000. The superintendent says that during 4 months of the year a higher per 
cent. of attendance than ever was reached, but sickness during the other months greatly 
reduced the general average. Enroliuent gained 140, average attendance losing 24. 
Increased attention was given to better instruction in the primary grades, the results of 
which were seen in the precision and accuracy of work in the secondary and grammar 
schools. Drawing was taught in all the grades, the eclectic system giving the most sat- 
isfactory results. The high school, under efficient teachers, did well, and graduated a 
class of 8. Schools were taught 176 days, and the advance, it is said, was steady, the 
work efficient. Private and parochial schools enrolled 300.— (State report and city 
return. ) 
RAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 10 State normal schools are State institutions only as being recognized and in 
part sustained by the State, the schools being each required to furnish buildings to ac- 
commodate 1,000 students and grounds of not less than 10 acres, which has burdened 
most of them with heavy indebtedness. Students who agree to teach in the common 
schools receive 50 cents a week and graduates who agree to teach 2 full years in the State 
schools may receive $50. These schools are not strictly professional, having, besides the 
normal courses, elementary, scientific, and classical courses. The whole attendance for 
1881-82 was 4,289; of normal students, 3,274: men 1,840, women 1,434; 475 graduated 
as teachers. The whole number of normal graduates since the recognition of the schools 
by the State is 1,726: 906 men, 820 women. All the principals of these schools report 
a year of progress, some the best in the history of the institution. All gave more impor- 
tance mae professional work, some urging that all else should be dropped.— (State 
report. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The Normal School for Girls of the City of Philadelphia and the normal class for boys 
in the Central High School of the same city in 1882 instructed 1,539 pupils in higher 
studies and in the science and methods of instruction. 
At Easton, Meadville, Norristown, and Pittsburgh there were also arrangements for 
further training of teachers already employed. 
The Brethren’s Normal College, Huntingdon, had for 1881—’82, under 11 instructors, 80 
normal students, 55 men and 25 women, and 9 normal graduates, of whom 6 were engaged 
in teaching. The school year is 42 weeks; course of study not defined.— (Return. ) 
Lycoming County Normal School, Muncy, had, during the school year of 20 weeks, under 
6 instructors, 115 normal students, 89 men and 62 women, in its 3-year course. “Of the 
whole number of graduates 140 were teaching. The graduates of this school were said 
to be in great demand, commanding the best positions and highest wages paid in the 
county. During the summer nearly every township was represented, more than one- 
half of the teachers in the county also being in attendance.— (Catalogue and return.) 
Snyder County Normat Institute, Selinsgrove, is a summer school, with sessions of from 
8 to 14 weeks, reporting for 1881—’82 12 students.— (Return. ) 
The Institute for Colored Youth, Philadelphia, gives instruction in the theory and prac- 
tice of teaching to its 3 highest classes. During 1881~’82 there were 163 of thesestudents: 
57 men and 106 women.— (Thirteenth annual report.) , 
The Philadelphia Training School for Kindergartners and the Centennial Kindergarten 
Training School for Teachers, Philadelphia, had each a 1-year course of study, the former 
reporting for the year 28 students, all graduating, and 22 having engaged in teaching; 
the latter, with 20 students, graduated 19, 15 of whom engaged in teaching. The school 
year of the former is 34 weeks; that of the latter, 40.— (Returns. ) 
Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, gives teachers’ diplomas to those graduates of the col- 
lege who have taken as their elective studies the entire course in the theory and practice 
of teaching, and gives certificates to non-graduates who have done not less than 1 year’s 
work in this department. Three graduated and 2 engaged in teaching.— (Return. ) 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ institutes, as provided by law, were held in all the 69 counties of the State 
between August, 1881, and January, 1882, 3 being in session 4 days, 60 for 5 days, and 6 
for5} days. Theaverageattendance of members was 13,078. The largestnumber of teach- 
ers present, 600. was ig Schuylkill County; the next largest, 538, was in Lancaster County;

Pittsburgh, York, and Luzerne Counties having, respectively, 400, 445, and 488. There 
were 522 instructors and lecturers employed, whose pay, with other items, amounted to 
$31,395. Among other exercises 187 essays were read. There were present 2,457 school 
directors, 2,277 honorary members, and 33,580 spectators.— (State report.) 
The holding of district institutes on two Saturdays in each month is authorized by law, 
but left discretionary with the board of directors. The two days thus spent are to be 
considered as part of the 22 days of the teacher’s legal month. There were 539 of these 
institutes held in 1881-’82. The cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Altoona have 
special institute laws. 
Local institutes were organized in nearly every county in the State. In 12 counties 
192 were held during the year. They are reported as being more popular than the county 
institutes, as they are conducted by the local teachers and directors and largely attended 
by the people. They are said to have become one of the powers in educational reform.— 
(School laws and State report.) 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS. 
The Pennsylvania School Journal, published monthly at Lancaster, was in its thirtieth 
and thirty-first volumes in 1882, and being the official organ of the department of educa- 
tion it gives much valuable information in regard to educational matters in the State. 
The other educational journals were The Chautauquan, at Meadville, in its second and 
third volumes; The Teacher, Philadelphia, in its fourth volume; the Educational Review, 
Pittsburgh, successor to The Allegheny Teacher and the Educational Voice, in its first 
and second volumes; The Pennsylvania Teacher, Pittsburgh, in volume 9 of the old 
series; The Student, Westtown, in its second and third volumes; and two irregular 
papers published by the Indian Training School at Carlisle, the Morning Star, and the 
Eadle Keatah Toh. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Without including Philadelphia, there were 2,270 public schools in which some of the 
higher branches were taught, a decrease of 30 from the previous year. Of these, 2,133 
were in the 66 counties reporting and 137 in the 33 cities and boroughs reporting. As 
to the condition and progress of these schools the State report gives no information. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and preparatory departments of 
colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and summaries of them in the 
report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The colleges of Pennsylvania in 1882, as givenin Table IX of theappendix, numbered 
27. Adding the Pennsylvania State College, in which classical collegiate instruction is 
maintained in connection with training in agriculture and the mechanic arts, the number 
would be 28. The University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University, Dickinson, Haver- 
ford, and Lafayette Colleges were still the only ones that confined their work strictly to 
collegiate instruction. The remainder had preparatory courses of 1 to 4 years in dura- 
tion, with classical collegiate courses of 4 years, except 5 Roman Catholic institutions, 
where the length of the collegiate courses cannot be clearly determined. For scienticfi 
courses, see Scientific Instruction, following. Haverford and Lafayette Colleges and 
Lehigh University offer advanced degrees only for higher study, prolonged beyond the 
collegiate course, instead of conferring them as a matter of course after a certain term of 
years. At the University of Pennsylvania there was lecture instruction, open to the 
public, in courses on German literature, on the older English classics, on national econ- 
omy and civil law, on physics and astronomical physics, on inorganic and organic chem- 
istry, and on classical archeology. The same university also instituted a faculty of 
philosophy, for the supervision of advanced study in the several departments of literature 
and science. The courses in this are to cover at least 2 years, are to be open to gradu- 
ates of this and like institutions, as well as to others evincing a capacity to pursue them, 
and are to lead tothedegree of PH. D. They include history, philosophy, philology, law, 
mathematics, and almost the whole range of natural sciences. This is true university 
work, and, under the supervision of intelligent professors, in the heart of a large city, 
where ample libraries and other aids to study are at hand, it opens opportunity for liter- 
ary and scientific progress which doubtless will in time draw many eager students. 
Several other institutions, such as the Western University of Pennsylvania, Allegheny; 
Muhlenberg College, Allentown; Haverford College, Haverford; Lafayette College, 
Easton; and Lincoln University, Lincoln, offered graduate instruction, but none on so 
broad a scale as the above. _ Commercial courses, too, were offered by most of the Roman

Catholic colleges; some training in art by at least 9; and astronomy, with the aid of ob- 
servatories, by the Western University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University, and by 
Dickinson, Haverford, Washington and Jefferson, and Allegheny Colleges. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Of the colleges for young men or for both sexes, Lebanon Valley, Ursinus, Thiel, 
Monongahela, Allegheny, Westminster, and Swarthmore admitted young women to 
equal privileges with young men, as did the State College and the University at Lewis- 
burg, while the University of Pennsylvania opened to them as to others the courses of 
lectures on literary and scientific subjects referred to above. 
Besides these, at least 18 schools and colleges especially for the instruction of young 
women in studies reaching often much beyond the elementary and sometimes well into 
the collegiate may be found in Table VIII of the appendix or in the memoranda that 
follow it. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The agricultural and mechanical instruction at the Pennsylvania State College, State 
College P. O., was continued and improved in 1882, under an able president, with some- 
what increased appropriations from the State. The preparation for these specialties is 
meant to be begun in a general scientific course of 4 years, from which the technical courses 
branch at the opening of the third year; but the president sajys that far too many stu- 
dents content themselves with only brief preparatory courses, and altogether fail to reach 
the purely technical courses. 
In at least 13 of the other colleges there were general scientific courses of 3 or 4 years 
in length, while, for more specific and thorough training, schools of civil, mechanical, 
and mining engineering were maintained, with chemical or chemical and metallurgical 
instruction added, in a 3-year course at the Western University of Pennyslvania, Alle- 
gheny; in 4-year courses at the Pennsylvania Military Academy, Chester; Lafayette 
College, Easton; Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, and Swarthmore College, Swarth- 
more; as well as in 5-year courses at the Towne Scientific School of the University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This last had 4 courses of this character, branching off 
from the general scientific course at the opening of the third year. The Swarthmore 
studies were largely elective; and so, to some extent, were the studies at Haverford Col- 
lege. Laboratory and other aids to effective scientific work were common to all the colleges 
named. Muhlenberg College, Allentown; Dickinson College, Carlisle; and Allegheny 
College, Meadville, also provided such aids for the study of natural sciences. 
The Wharton School of Finance in the University of Pennsylvania, founded for the 
thorough study of the science of business, had only reached its second year in 1882, with 2 
regular and 7 special students, but with an apparatus for instruction and a thoroughness 
of course that must ere long make it an important factor in instruction preparatory to 
financial work. To enter on its 3-year course one must have a fair approximation to a 
collegiate training in mathematical, English, and linguistic studies, these last includ- 
ing French and German, with Latin and Greek optional. 
The Franklin Institute, Spring Garden Institute, and Wagner Free Institute of Science, 
all in Philadelphia, continued and in several ways enlarged their very useful work 
of instructing, in classes or by lectures, persons desirous of fitting themselves properly 
for industrial occupations. Practice in the elements of the industries to be prepared for 
supplemented the instruction given in at least the latter two. 
‘Two other institutions came into essentially the same field of work, the Girard College 
for Orphans, which undertakes to train its boys, in workshops connected with the col- 
lege, in the use of tools and in the first steps in mechanics; and a mining firm at Drifton, 
Luzerne County, which established an Industrial School for Miners and Mechanics, to fit its 
brighter boys and men to become good machinists and effective mine bosses. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theology.—The statistics and denominational connection of fifteen schools preparing 
students for the Christian ministry in this State may be found in Table XI of the appen- 
dix and asummary of such statistics in the report of the Commissioner preceding. Four- 
teen of these schools had 3-year courses, meant to be prepared for by at least an academic 
and if possible by a collegiate course. The remaining school, at Bethlehem (Moravian), 
had only a 2-year course following a substantially collegiate one at Nazareth Hall. 
Two others appear in 1882, not termed theological, but practically such, one a biblical 
elective course at Dickinson College, Carlisle; the other a biblical department at Alle- 
gheny College, Meadville; both under Methodist Episcopal influences and both combining 
the Hebrew of the Old Testament and Greek of the New with studies of an ordinary col-

legiate course, that at Allegheny College giving instruction also in the evidences of chris- 
tianity, biblical literature, and studies in theism. 
Law.—The law department of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, with a 
course of 2 years, appears to haye been in 1882 the only law school in the State. It 
provided lectures on the institutes of law; personal relations and personal property; real 
estate, conveyancing, and equity jurisprudence; practice, pleading, and evidence; and 
medical jurisprudence. It graduated 37 bachelors of laws in June. 
Medicine.—The medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 
the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, and the Medico-Chirurgical College, also 
in the same city, maintained still in 1882 their regular 3-year graded courses, in the first, 
of 26 weeks each year, with a free preliminary course of 2 weeks; in the second, of 20 
weeks, and in the third, of 24. A preliminary examination in English and in physies was 
required at the university. Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, ‘‘regular,’”’ contin- 
ued its old 2-year course of 24 weeks each without any special gradation of its studies and 
without any preliminary test of qualification for undertaking these studies. The medical 
staff at the university offered, besides its required 3-year course, a fourth supplemental 
year; also, 3 terms of graduate instruction covering 7 months. An auxiliary faculty of 
medicine has also, since 1865, supplemented the ordinary winter course by giving lect- 
ures during the spring months on such collateral branches as medical jurisprudence and 
toxicology, mineralogy and geology, botany, hygiene, comparative anatomy, and zoél- 
ogy. 
The Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia continued to be the only homeo- 
pathic school in the State. Its requirements were, as before, 3 years of study under a 
medical preceptor, attendance on 2 lecture courses of 22 weeks each, and the passing ofa 
final examination. A 3-year graded course was recommended but not required. 
Dentistry was taught in 3 schools: The Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery, the 
Philadelphia Dental College, and the Department of Dentistry of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, all in Philadelphia and all with 2-year courses of 20 weeks each. The course 
in the University of Pennsylvania was graded. 
Pharmacy.—Philadelphia and Pittsburgh each had a Collegeof Pharmacy, with 2-year 
courses of 20 weeks each, meant to supplement 4 years of apprenticeship in some reputa- 
ble pharmacal establishment. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
TRAINING IN ART. 
The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, has its regular school of art, in 
which classes are trained in drawing, painting, and sketching from life and from models, 
besides which, art instruction is given in the Normal Art School, the Woman’s Indu@rial 
Art School, and in the art department of the Spring Garden Institute, in all which there 
were 2,000 persons studying the various branches of art. 
The Pennsylvania School of Art adopted for 1882-’83 a schedule of prices for instruction 
which had previously been gratuitous, the fee for a session of 8 months to be $48, with 
all privileges; the fee for a single month $8, with like privileges; for the antique class, 
day and night, $4 a month; and for the life class, $4 a month. 
Mr. Charles G. Leland, by the authority of the Philadelphia school board, introduced 
the teaching of the minor arts into the public schoois, by which any child in them may be 
enabled to perform decorative work in the rudiments of tile painting, leather work, wood 
carving, sheet metal work, etching, papier mAché work, glass work, pottery, painting, 
modelling in clay, art needle work, stencilling, illumination, and a number of other in- 
dustries. 
The School of Design for Women, Philadelphia, the School of Design for Women, Pitts- 
burgh, and the Art School at Meadville send no reports for 1881-’82. 
TRAINING IN MECHANICS. 
Girard College added in 1882 a mechanical department through an appropriation for this 
purpose by the board of citytrusts. The plan of this school includes a complete machine 
shop in the basement, with 35 work benches, vises, a forge, a full setof machine tools, and 
an engine. A superintendent was employed, who visited the principal technical schools 
of the Eastern States and then entered upon the work of this new school. Withoutany 
appreciable interference with the usual course of study, 150 to 200 boys, divided into 5 
classes, received daily instruction in the use of tools, the properties of materials used in 
construction, and the proper proportion of parts in machine construction. The pupils 
are given an opportunity to do practical work and acquire skill in the use of tools. 
Great interest was manifested by the boys, the work being so attractive that there has 
‘been no instance of a pupil reported for idleness or misconduct. Some of the work is 
said to be exceedingly creditable. The expenses for the year were $6,536.
-P-A-G-E-521
PENNSYLVANIA. 227 
Training in mechanical handiwork is also given in the Spring Garden Institute and 
instruction preparatory to industrial work in mechanics, chemistry, and engineering was 
continued in the lectures of the Franklin Instituig. 
TRAINING IN ORATORY. 
The National School of Elocution and Oratory, Philadelphia, offers a 1-year course of 
instruction in elocution, including junior and senior evening courses, and a course in ora- 
tory extending through 2 years of 36 weeks each. In addition to the regular course of 
instruction a series of lectures is given upon a wide range of topics connected with the 
work of the school, No report for 1881-’82 is at hand. 
TRAINING IN MUSIC. 
The Musical College and Pennsylvania Normal Music School, Freeburgh, offers in- 
struction in the science and art of music, as well as training for both sexes in all branches 
of vocal and instrumental music. It is said to be the only institution of the kind in the 
State. There were 100 preparing to be teachers, and 25 others. There were 20 engaged 
in teaching. Since its organization in 1870 1,000 pupils have received its instructions. 
Annual conventions are held in January and are largely attended by musicians from 
Pennsylvania and other States. 
The other musical schools heretofore noted, but from which there are no reports for 
1881~’82 are Madam Seiler’s School of Vocal Art and Instrumental Music, Philadelphia, 
and the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Philadelphia, reported 23 teach- 
ers, including the principal, superintendent, and matron, with 383 inmates during the 
year, 210 boys and 173 girls, of whom 290 were from the State. During the year 66 
were dismissed, 46 having completed the full course, and 61 new pupils were admitted. 
Since the opening, 2,000 pupils had been educated in this institution, of whom one-third 
were congenital mutes, a majority of the others having lost their hearing through sick- 
ness.! Articulation and lip reading were taught, it is said, with encouraging success. 
A branch for oral instruction was sustained as a day school for city pupils, with an at- 
tendance of 48, under 6 teachers. The work done there during the year is reported as 
eminently successful. The industries of tailoring; shoemaking, and lithography were 
successfully pursued. By far the largest industry in the institution was dressmaking 
and sewing, in which 120 girls were taught 2 hours each day, using during the year 
12,635 yards of material. Lessons in cookery were given with good results; also, in the 
laundry. Two legacies were received, one of $5,000, the other of $2,500, the latter for 
the fund for destitute deaf-mutes. Extensive repairs were made, the buildings and 
grounds being valued at $500,000, with a library of 5,000 volumes. 
The Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, Turtle 
Creek, reported inadequate accommodations for the wants of Western Pennsylvania, 
there being in 29 counties 239 deaf-mutes of proper school age who have never received 
instruction and cannot be admitted to the institution for want of room. Provision has 
been made for the erection of an additional building, at an estimated cost of $160,000. 
The attendance for the year was 124 —77 boys, 47 girls— with 9 instructors, including the 
principal and matron. Twenty were dismissed and 15 new ones added. Of the 165 
inmates since the opening, 59 were’ born deaf, 39 made so by fevers and 67 by other dis- 
eases, nearly all under 3 years of age, the ratio of sex being 3 boys to 2 girls, which is 
said to be the ratio in all the institutions. Four-fifths of the pupils were taught only 
the manual system, while 21 were taught orally and in articulation and lip reading, 
with varied results. No industries have been provided for. 
The Drie School for Deaf-Mutes, Erie, is a part of the city school system. The articu- 
lation method was reported as being successfully taught. 
The Scranton Deaf-Mute School, Scranton, under the control of the eity board of edu- 
cation, reported 1 teacher and 13 pupils, 6 males and 7 females, having instructed 18 
since its foundation. The school is graded as primary. 
é EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Philadelphia, made its fiftieth 
annual report December, 1882, showing 33 instructors, 28 employés, 27 blind employ¢s 
and workmen, and 170 pupils, having admitted 1,130 since opening. ‘The literary depart- 
ment comprises elementary, grammar, and high school branches, including scientific 
training in vocal and instrumental music, a large church organ and piano being provided. 
The industries were mattress, broom, and brush making, cane seating, carpet weaving,

sewing by hand and machine, and bead work. There were made during the year 11,733 
brushes, 28,175 brooms, and 1,783 yards of carpet, which, with other articles, including 
knitting, sewing, and bead work, were valued at $7,750. Pupils are admitted from 10 to 
21 years of age. A Kindergarten department for children between 8 and 10 years of 
age was much needed. Five graduates have been receivéd by the Pentisylvania Univer- 
sity, 4of whom graduated ‘with honor, the other standing high in his class. There was 
1 blind person to each 1,100 of the’population of the State. There was.a library of 
1,500 volumes, containing a full supply of books in raised typer The State appropria- 
tion was $43,500;-total income, $59,473; expenses, $70,160; and grounds, buildings, and 
apparatus were Valued at $187,000. Information was received through the Philadelphia 
Evening Telegraph that the institution was to receive $130,000 from the estate of Mrs. 
Mary Shields, deceased.— (Report and return.) 
There are in West Philadelphia the Pennsylvania Working Home for Blind Men and 
the Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women. These homes are for those who, leay- 
ing the parent institution and failing to get employment at their trades, do not become 
self supporting. In the former, 65 men found employment during the year and made 
225,000 brooms, besides many brushes. In the latter, 45 females found employment, 
most of whom it is said would otherwise have been homeless. The future wants of these 
when old and helpless are provided for by an organized charity called the Pennsylvania 
Retreat for Blind Mutes and Aged and Infirm Blind Persons.— (Report.) 
EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn,reported 403 
inmates, the year beginning with 355; 48 were admitted and 48 dismissed, closing the year 
with the same number aslast year. Of these 191 were supported by the State, 50 by New 
Jersey, 1 by Delaware, 16. by Philadelphia, 67 by parents and guardians, 10 by a free 
fund, and 20 by theinstitution. Of the 48 admitted nearly 86 per cent. were residents of 
the State, from 1 to 21 years of age. In the school department there were 158 pupils and 
8 teachers; in the manual, 121; in the asylum and nursery, 76. e 
The industries taught were mattress and shoe making, caning, farm, garden, and grad- 
ing work, washing, domestic duties, and sewing. All not physically incapacitated were 
thus employed, and many, it is said, were trained so as to become very useful. Of the 
48 discharged 16 were physically unimproved, 23 improved, and 9 greatly improved; while 
of the 355 resident at close of the year 193 had mentally improved in the school, 132 re- 
mained stationary, and 30 had deteriorated through disease.. During the term of 7 
years fully 10 per cent. are so improved as to be capable of self care and usefulness. The 
legislature atits last session appropriated $40,000 for the maintenance of 200 feeble-minded 
' children of the State and $60,000 for 2 additional buildings, to one of which the whole 
asylum and nursery department were soon to be transferred. These 2 additional build- 
ings, with the present ones, will accommodate 460 pupils. The Pittsburgh and Allegheny 
Protestant Orphan Asylums have contributed $5,000 as a foundation for 1+perpetual 
free lodging. It is estimated that 40 per cent. of the inmates will sooner or later be 
candidates for.a life home in the institution, and a ‘‘free fund”? of $200,000 is being raised 
to meet this future necessity; of this, $75,000 were secured. The property, including 
139 acres of land, was valued at $231,092.— (Reports of the board of public charities 
and of the institution.) 
EDUCATION OF ORPHANS, 
Girard College, Philadelphia, reported for December, 1882, a cofisolidated family of 
1,333 persons, of whom 29 were teachers and 1,104 pupils. The year began with 878 
pupils, adding 300 during the year and dismissing 71, betweén the ages of 14 and 18, to 
begin active life; 3 died. From 150 to 200 boys, in classes of 5, have received regular 
mechanical instruction in workshops under an experienced teacher, in which the pupils 
are said to have taken a deep interest. The pupils are grouped into 4 schools, torre- 
sponding to the ordinary primary, intermediate, grammar, and high schools. Thé aver- 
age cost ve maintenance for a boy during the year was $305.92.— (Report of board of 
trustees. 
The State includes in its public school system homes (which are also scHools) for the 
orphans of Pennsylvania soldiers in the civil war. These homes numbered 18 in 1880, 
and in 1882 10 reported, with an aggregaté of 2,963inmates, being an increase of 361, the 
cost for the year being $381,764. Seven of these schools reported to this Bureau 1,691in- 
mates and 6,518 since their foundation. In addition to thorough training in the com- 
mon school branches, considerable attention was giverfto industrial pursuits. By ah act 
of 1878 it was provided that no more children should be admitted'to the sthools after 
June, 1882, and that the schools be finally closed June, 1885, for admissions;"hawever, 
applications continued to come in in 1882, leaving on file 737, rendering it certain tha¢in 
June, 1885, there will be 1,770 children on the rolls of the schools under.16 years, the

fegal age for dismissal. Earnest efforts were being made for a change of the law in view 
of these facts.— (Pennsylvania School Journal.) 
Besides these, 28 other institutions for the care and instruction of orphan and dependent 
children, maintained by local and general charities, reported for 1882, Ten were in 
Philadelphia, the others elsewhere in the State. The age for admission ranged from 
1 to 16,years. Boys at 18 and girls at 16 were provided with homes or apprenticed to 
trades, in many cases with an outfit of clothes and $25 in money. Most of them were 
said to be doing well. There was a general uniformity as to school and industrial train- 
ing, some using the Kindergarten method. 
Of these 28 institutions, 6 were Roman Catholic, 12 non-sectarian, 3 Lutheran, 2 Re- 
formed, 2 Protestant Episcopal, 1 Hebrew, 1 Presbyterian, and 1 Friends. The 28 schools 
réperted 171 teachers; 24 had 1,992 inmates; 23 had had 18,064 since foundation; 21 
had incomes for the year aggregating $331,468; and 14 reported 12,759 volumes in their 
libraries. The printed returns give the dates of opening of these orphan schools as fol- 
lows: The oldest one, the Orphan Society of Philadelphia, was opened in 1814. From 
that date to 1850 but 3 others are reported; between 1850 and 1860, 10 more were opened; 
between 1860 and 1870, 7 more; between 1870 and 1880, 6, including 1 opened during 
1880.— (Returns. ) 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
There are 2 distinctively reformatory institutions in the State, viz: the House of» 
Refuge, Philadelphia, and the Pennsylvania Reform School, Morganza. 
The House of Refuge originated at a public meeting in Philadelphia held in 1826, called 
by a number of benevolent gentlemen who recognized the need of a school for erringand 
neglected children. A society was organized, chartered in March, and funds amount- 
ing to about $135,000 were raised. In 1828 suitable buildings were ready, and in De- 
cember, 1829, the first child was received. In 1850 the department for colored children 
was opened in separate buildings erected for them. In 1870 separate buildings were 
erected for white girls on grounds presented by the city of Philadelphia and dedicated 
in 1872, when the girls were transferred to their spacious and comfortable home. The 
institution is supported by donations, by the earnings of the inmates, and by annual ap- 
propriations from the State and the city of Philadelphia. It is governed by a board of 
37 managers chosen annually. The average number of inmates has varied from 550 
to 600 annually, and since opening nearly 14,000 have been under its care and discipline. 
\Of these, 8,675 were white boys, 2,719 white girls, 1,534 colored boys, and 843 colored 
girls. Two-thirds of all these are said to have been restored to society. In the schools 
the common branches, including drawing, are taught by experienced female teachers. 
One evening a week is devoted to training in vocal and brass band music. Of those 
placed in homes during the last 3 years, favorable reports were received in 486 cases, fair 
in 108, and unfavorable in 87. The library contains 2,890 volumes suited to the minds 
of children. The average period of retention, heretofore 15 months, was recently ex- 
tended to 24. 
The Pennsylvania Reform School, which opened in 1854 on the congregate system, was 
changed to the family system in 1876, withlarger grounds and buildings. The boysand 
girls, divided into 6 familes, are kept entirely separate; each group is brought, as nearly 
as possible, into the condition of a family and everything suggestive of prison life is 
avoided. All attend school 4} hours each school day. The industries are various and 
every one may learn some trade to follow as an honorable calling in life. By a system 
of merits inmates may obtain release in 2 years, but only when the managers are assured 
that they go to good homes and regular employments. The whole number under its care 
since opening was 4,278: boys, 3,166; girls, 1,112. These were committed at the aver- 
age age of 13.9. Of the 396 committed during the 2 years covered by the last report, 
83 had intemperate fathers ; 10, intemperate mothers; 47, illiterate parents; 150, parents 
who could read and write; 76 had been previously arrested; 8 had parents in prison; . 
and 10, parents in almshouses. The president of the board of managers says that every 
year brings evidence of the value of this school to the State. Many who without it 
would have been vicious and criminal are now respectable and industrious men and 
women. Some of the boys are at the head of the shops where they work.— (Report. ) 
The aggregate population of the 2 schools for 1882 was 1,431: whites 1,095, colored 
336; an increase of 66 in whites and a decrease of 3 in colored as compared with the 
previous year. The committals of the 2 schools were 498: whites 405, colored 93; three- 
fourths were boys. The combined receipts from the industries pursued by the inmates 
for 1882 were $22,942, the House of Refuge earning $17,530 and the Reform School 
$5,412. The aggregate appropriations from the State for 1881 and 1882 were $183,545, - 
the House of Refuge receiving $103,545 and the Reform School $80,000.— (Report of the 
board of public charities. )

230 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
TRAINING OF INDIANS. 
The Indian Training School, Carlisle, in its third annual report for 1882, shows 267 
Indian pupils from 24 different tribes at the close of 1881. There were added during 
the year 126 from 16 different tribes, 6 had died, and 90 had returned to agencies, leav- 
ing at the close of the year 296 pupils (boys, 188; girls, 108) from 33 different tribes. 
In school room work the chief point forthe first two years is to learn the English lan- 
guage. The most satisfactory progress for the year was in English speaking, rewards 
being offered for speaking only English for a week, and then larger ones for a month. 
al instruction is held to be of equal importance with school work, one-half of 
‘y working day being given to each. The 134 apprentices manufactured during the 
year wagons, harness, tinware, and shoes valued, in Government contract prices, at $6,731; 
besides this, all repairs were made by them. All the boys not trained in the shops 
worked the farm, cutting the grain with hand cradles and hay with scythes. The girls 
make all their own and most of the boys’ garments, do all the household sewing by 
hand and machine, and wash and iron 2,500 pieces every week. Lessons in.cookery are 
given and all the girls are trained in general housekeeping and economy. ‘Thesuperin- 
tendent says that no feature of the work is more productive of good results than that of 
temporary homes with good families during vacations.— (Report of the Commissioner 
of Indian Affairs. ) 
     
TRAINING IN COOKERY. 
The Cooking School of the New Century Woman’s Club, organized in 1882, while 
teaching expensive classes, aims to help working women, through cheap evening classes. 
Courses of 5 and 10 cent lessons were given at the Franklin and Spring Garden Institutes. 
Free instruction was given in the ward houses of the society for organizing chavities. 
The object of this school is teach how to make the best use of the cheapest materials 
and to test the comparative nutritiousness of different food materials. To demonstrate 
the economy of scientific cookery, 25 gentlemen were invited to dine, first on a bill of 
fare, costing at retail market price, $4.50, or 18 cents each; and then a second dinner on 
a bill of fare costing $2.25, or 9 cents a guest. 
INSTRUCTION IN FARMING. 
Farming was taught to children in a recently organized Farm Garden School, Philadel- 
phia, by Mrs. Briant. The object is to give children an idea of farming life, founded on 
the belief that emigration to the West will solve the problem of overcrowded cities. A 
trough, 4 feet by 3, filled with earth, represents the farm, where the whole process of rais- 
ing a crop of corn is illustrated.—(Journal of Education.) 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
For statistics of training schools for nurses, see Table XVII of the appendix, and a 
summary of it in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
KITCHEN GARDEN INSTRUCTION. 
Classes of this kind are said to have been formed in Philadelphia, of which no official 
report has been received. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
PROF. WILLIAM HENRY ALLEN, M. D., LL. D. 
This honored educator was born near Augusta, Me., March 17, 1808, prepared for col- 
lege at the Maine Wesleyan Seminary, and entered Bowdoin College 1829, from which 
he graduated in 1833; he was a teacher of Greek and Latin in Oneida Conference Semi- 
nary 2} years; principal of Augusta High School, Maine, in 1836; professor of chemistry 
and natural philosophy in Dickinson College from 1836 to 1848; professor of philosophy 
and English literature in the same college from 1848 to 1850, being acting president 
during part of this time; and was president of Girard College fron 1850 to 1863. After

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The general supervision of the public schools is vested in a State board of education; 
a State commissioner of publie schools, chosen annually by the board, acts as its secre- 
tary. The school committee of each town consists of 3 residents of the town elected 
 
-P-A-G-E-526

232 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
for 3 years, with annual change of 1. A town may elect a superintendent of schools 
annually; if it fail to do so, he may be appointed by the school committee. For each 
district 1 or 3 trustees must be elected annually by the people. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all resident citizens of the State without regard to age, 
race, or color. To support schools the sum of $90,000 is paid annually from the income 
of a permanent school fund and from other money in the treasury, on the order of the 
commissioner of public schools, the money to be used for the payment of teachers only. 
No town may receive any part of the State appropriation unless it raise by tax for the 
support of public schools an equal amount. There is an annual appropriation of $3,000 
to purchase works of reference and other apparatus for the schools. Means for the 
maintenance of evening schools are also provided. Towns may vote such sums as they 
deem necessary for the support of schools, purchase of sites, erection and repair of 
school-houses, and maintenance of school libraries. Any town establishing a free pub- 
lie library may appropriate. 20 cents on. each $1,000 of its ratable property for its sup- 
port. Towards the maintenance of such library the State board may appropriate an- 
nually a sum not exceeding $50 for the first 500 volumes in such library and $25 for 
every additional 500. The board may also allow $500 annually for teachers’ institutes, 
$500 for aiding in training in industrial art, and $300 for distributing educational jour- 
nals and other means of promoting education. The training of deaf-mutes, of the blind, 
and of the feeble-minded is likewise provided for. Any one employing a minor under 
15 years of age in work that prevents attendance upon school is subject, together with 
* the parent or guardian of the child, to a penalty of $20 for each offence. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics of the State commissioner’s report show that with an increase of 2,755 
in youth of school age only 668 more were enrolled in public day schools and 107 more 
in evening schools. The number of youth of school age not attending any school in- 
creased from 12,730 to 13,826 during the year. The average length of the school term 
fell off 2 days. But as there was an increase of school buildings, of graded schools, of the 
general public school property, of the number of schools taught, and of the funds for 
the support of them, the commissioner thinks the showing very good upon the whole. 
In addition to the 35,055 reported by the school census as attending public schools 
there were 6,964 in private and church schools. An advance of $1.44 was made in the 
average monthly pay of men teaching and one of $1.64 in that of women. The commis- 
sioner advocates the grading of salaries and deplores the neglect of some of the school offi- 
cers, remarking that nearly a quarter of the schools outside of the 2 chief cities were not 
reported as having been visited by them during the year even the minimum number of 
times required by law. Corporal punishment was permitted in the public schools, but 
itis seldom inflicted. Training in morals is encouraged.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, 
Lineotn reported 13 school buildings, containing 29 graded and 4 ungraded schools, 
taught by 7 men and 31 women, with a session of 10 months. The value of school 
property was $95,000. There were 382 children in private and church schools and 1,336 
in no school. One new school-house containing 4 rooms was built during the year. 
Newport had 11 school-houses, with 37 graded and 2 ungraded schools. In the evening 
schools there were 240 boys and 85 girls, taught 60 evenings by 12 teachers, the average 
attendance being only 123. The total expense of the evening schools was $894. Onenew 
building had been erected during the year for day schools, There were 825 pupils in 
private and church schools and 941 in no school. Music and drawing were taught by 
special teachers. 
Pawtucket in its 18 school-houses had 40 graded and 5 ungraded schools. The 5 even- 
ing schools had an enrolment of 655 pupils, taught 12 weeks by 26 teachers. There 
were 534 private and church schools and 382 in no school. The estimated value of all 
school property was $174,000. Of the receipts for public schools $5,576 were from the 
State. Drawing was taught by a special teacher. 
Providencé reported 51 school buildings, the same number as last year, valued, with 
sites, furniture, &c., at nearly a million and a half of dollars. All its 246 schools were 
graded. There were 10 evening schools, an increase of 1, taught a little more than 16 
weeks by 106 teachers, with an enrolment of 1,536 boys and 599 girls, an increase of 
1,810 over 1881. There were 3,693 pupils in private and church schools and 4,920 in no 
school. The city superintendent deplores the non-enforcement of the truant law and says 
truancy is a rapidly growing evil, attributing to this cause the fact that arrests of minors 
for crimes and misdemeanors amounted to 1,117, or more than 14 per cent. of the arrests 
for the entire year. 
Warwick reported 18 graded and 10 ungraded schools in 18 buildings, valued, with sites, 
&c., at $36,913. There were 73 in private and church schools and 1,120 in no school. 
The city superintendent reports that 10 per cent. of all the absenteeism for the State 
belongs to Warwick and strongly recommends a suitable State truant law. 
Woonsocket had 32 graded and 3 ungraded schools in 15 buildings, valued at $150,000. 
Evening schools, 3 in number, were taught 74 weeks by 11 teachers, with 326 pupils 
enrolled. There were 645 pupils in private and church schools and 1,392 in no school. 
The falling off from the grammar schools during the year was 91. The superintendent, 
in recommending a compulsory school law, says that almost 1,400 children in the city 
have not attended school a single day for the year, but roam the streets during school 
hours : the great wrong being done them cannot be corrected unless truant laws shall be 
enacted by which they can be reached. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS, 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The State Normal School, Providence, requires for admission an examination of all but 
graduates of high schools. It has a 2-year course, prescribed by the board of education, 
which high school graduates usually finish in less time. An advanced course is also of- 
fered, including Greek, Latin, French, German, mathematics, and natural sciences. Such 
advanced study may be pursued in connection with the 2-year course, but not to the neglect 
of authorized common school studies. Observation and practice teaching are introduced 
in the senior year, The whole number of students during the year was 159, of whom. 
18 pursued one or more studies of the advanced course. Graduates of the year, 23. 
Graduates receive State diplomas, which do not, however, entitle them to teach without 
farther examination. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The State provides institute training for teachers by appropriating $500 annually for 
that purpose, the institutes to be held under the direction of the commissioner of public 
schools. Institutes were held in 1882 at, Wickford, at Bristol, and at Shannock Mills. 
Each meeting is said to have been a success, the attendance both of teachers and citizens 
being unusually full. The commissioner was assisted by Principal Greenough, of the 
State Normal School, who presented geography and the correct methods of teaching it, 
and several other branches; also, by Miss Marble, teacher of natural science in the same 
school, she devoting 2 lessons to mineralogy, showing howit should be taught and studied 
in the common schools. Nine other speakers and lecturers aided in the work by pre- 
senting such topics as the teaching of language, school hygiene, business arithmetic, 
English composition, English grammar, and common fractions. The superintendent, 
recognizing the importance of these institutes (they being provided by the State for the 
benefit of the schools), reeommends that the State give the commissioner power to close 
the schools within such limits as he may determine during the sessions of the institutes.

SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Full information of this class of schools has been received from the chief cities only. The Rogers High School, Newport, enrolled 140 pupils and had 7 instructors, A grad- uate course pursued by 11 students was added, requiring attendance at 8 or more recita- 
tions each week. Providence High School, with two courses for boys and a special de- partment for girls, had 515 pupils for 188i-’82, with 16 teachers. Bristol, Pawtucket, and 
Warren maintained high schools and Woonsocket enrolled 97 pupils, under 3 teachers. 
South Kingston, which had a high school in 1881, makes no report of it for 1862. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academies, and schools preparatory to col- 
lege, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix to this volume. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
BROWN UNIVERSITY. 
Brown University, Providence, for young men only, the only institution for superior 
instruction in the State, offered for 1882 its 3 courses of 4 years each, the first leading 
to the degree of A. B., the second and third to that of PH. B. The university main- 
tained its usual high standard of instruction, with an enrolment of 263 classical and 7 
scientific students, under 17 instructors. The value of the buildings, including grounds, 
apparatus, and library, amounted to $1,250,000. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
‘The departments of practical science in Brown University for special preparation in the 
mathematical and physical sciences and their application to industrial arts were contin- 
ued in 1882. The department of civil engineering occupied 4 years, subject to modifi- 
cation according to the wants and abilities of the students. The physical laboratory 
is used during the second half year by a limited number of students. Instruction in 
botany is given by lectures, practical class work, and drawing fromnature. The course 
in agriculture includes chemistry and physics, botany and physiology, and zodlogy and 
comparative anatomy, with special lectures in agriculture. This course also includes 
practical instruction in obtaining and preserving specimens and in taxidermy. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No professional schools are reported in the State for 1882. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 
The Rhode Island School for the Deaf, Providence, established in 1877 and under the 
control of the State board of education, up to December 31, 1882, had had a total attend- 
ance of 41, of whom 27 then remained out of 33 present during some part of the year, 
under 3 instructors. One of the chief aims of the school is to give the pupils command 
of written language. Another is to teach them to understand speech by watching the 
movements of the lips of others, an exercise in which they have daily practice. At the 
5 suggestion of the State school commissioner, afternoon sessions were established in Sep- 
tember, 1882, for the benefit of pupils living out of the city, the 3 teachers taking charge 
alternately. 
INSTRUCTION IN ART. 
The Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, in its fourth year, offered courses of 
systematictraining in free hand and mechanical drawing, painting in oil and water 2olors, 
and modelling in clay. Instruction was also given in making original designs for tiles, 
wall paper, jewellery, furniture, carpets, cotton prints, book covers, &c. There were 46 
pupils in the first (day) class, 77 in the advanced (day and evening) class, and 43 in the 
Saturday morning children’s class, an increase in all of 16 over 1881. The primary aim is 
to furnish such instruction in the elements of industrial art as may prepare artisans for the 
skilful prosecution of their work, as well as enable them and others to become successful 
art teachers.

INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC. 
Greenwich Academy, East Greenwich, for 1882 offered 2 courses of instruction, onein 
instrumental and vocal music and the other in musical composition and the science of 
music, 
INDUSTRIAL AND REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Rhode Island State Reform School, Howard, received 148 children committed in 
1882 and discharged 179, leaving in the institution 126 boys (of whom 12 were colored), 
under 14 teagiers. The common English branches were taught and the industries of 
chairmaking, farming, washing, housework, and tailoring. Since the school was estab- 
lished in 1850 as the Providence Reform School, there had been committed 3,273 chil- 
dren 10-18 years of age. After leaving the institution the boys are under the supervision 
of the school ofiicers, and it has thus been ascertained that two-thirds of them have be- 
come useful and orderly members of society. The cost of the school for the year was 
$17,500 and its earnings were $8,495.— (Return.) 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION, 
STATE INSTITUTE. 
The Rhode Island Institute of Instruction held its thirty-seventh annual meeting at 
Providence January 12-14, 1882, J. Milton Hall presiding. There was a large attend- 
ance of teachers from all parts of the State. The exercises opened with an address on 
arithmetic, followed by addresses and papers on ‘‘Growth,’’ ‘“ Pronunciation of Latin,” 
“Deep-sea soundings,’’ ‘‘Teaching United States history, ” “Geography,” and. “Blo 
eution.’’? Superintendent A. P. Marble, of Massachusetts, read an able paper on ‘‘ Educa- 
tion many sided,” which cautioned the teachers against falling into “ruts,”? against 
doing the same thing the same way every time, saying that in a general sense ‘there isno 
best way, every way having its advantages and disadvantages and none being suitable 
for adoption as an exclusive method. President J. H. Seelye, of Amherst, in hisaddress 
said we need higher education, and the real outcome of education is not culture alone, 
but character as well: there is something more than culture in the producing of charac- 
ter; we need the wisest and closest care for the higher schools of learning; but when 
culture is accomplished there is still a deeper question. President Seelye closed his 
address with an earnest plea for moral and religious training. Other speakers urged 
that moral culture and good manners should go hand in hand with intellectual training, 
Prof. William C. Russel insisting that morality is entirely within the sphere of school 
teaching. Resolutions were adopted declaring: That the teachers should point out the 
danger of using intoxicating drinks; that they should discourage the use of tobacco in 
all its forms, and should, as far as possible, advise their pupils in regard to books and 
periodicals read.out of school; that a truant law is needed for the protection of the com- 
mon school system; and that the address of Dr. Seelye be indorsed. A few closing re- 
marks were made by the president, after which the meeting adjourned.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The general educational ifiterests of the State are in the hands of a State superintend- 
ent of education, elected by the people for 2 years, and of a State board of examiners, 
composed of the superintendent and 4 others appointed biennially by the governor. 
Local officers are county school commissioners, elected by the people; a county board of 
3 examiners, including the commissioner as chairman, with 2 other members appointed 
by the State board for 2-year terms; and district boards of 3 trustees, appointed for 2 
years by the county boards. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained from the proceeds ofa tax of 2 mills on $1 and a poll 
tax of $1 on each voter. These funds, under the constitution, are to be distributed to
-P-A-G-E-531
  
‘SOUTH: CAROLINA. 237 
the se¥eral ‘school ‘districts’ in proportion to the respective number of pupils attending. 
As this has been construed in some sections of the State to mean enrolment and in oth- 
ers to mean average attendance, the law was amended in 1878 by a provision that after 
1882-’83 the basis for apportionment shall be average attendance. ‘here is no general 
law for district taxation, although local taxes are levied in Charleston and other locali- 
ties under special laws.. The length of the school term in each county is limited by 
the amount of public money received, notwithstanding the fact that the constitution re- 
quires a 6 months’ term. ‘Teachers must have certificastes of qualification from the State 
or county board of examiners and must report annually to the board of trustees. 
County school commissioners must report annually to the State superintendent or forfeit 
one-fourth of their pay to the school fund. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show a marked increase in the number of schools, number of teachers, 
number enrolled, amount of expenditure, and length of the school term; the average of 
the last, however, was lessened by the diversion of a large part of the school fund to pay 
claims due for expenses of previous years. The school revenues for 1880-’81 were larger 
than those reported for any previous year, and the superintendent thought that the 
amount for 1881-82 would be still larger, although he had not full returns on this point 
at the date of his report. A decrease appears in the number and value of school-houses, 
put the returns relating to these are very imperfect. Comparatively few are owned by 
the public; most of the schools are taught in churches, residences, &c., of which no ac- 
curate reports can be made. 4 : 
The superintendent has observed a marked improvement in the character and attain- 
ments of the teachers, resulting, he thinks, from the higher standard of qualification re- 
quired for certificates, the gradual increase of salaries and their payment in full each 
year, and from State normal institutes. These institutes, moreover, have given a great 
impetus to the cause of education throughout the State, all classes of schools (public and 
rivate), academies, colleges, and seminaries having been stimulated by their influence. 
State report.) 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
The income of the Peabody fund having been much diminished, the trustees have used 
the greater part of it in the education of teachers. During the year South Carolina had 
$5,375; of this Claflin University received $250 for training colored teachers; the public 
schools, $2,150; and teachers’ institutes, $1,400; scholarships at Hampton, Va., cost $250, 
and scholarships at Nashville, Tenn., $1,325. The latter are held by 7 students from 
South Carolina at the Nashville Normal College. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF CHARLESTON. 
OFFICERS. 
The Charleston public schools, according to a law passed in 1882, are governed by a 
board of 10 commissioners instead of 8, as formerly. Six of these are to be elected by the 
people, being one for each school district into which the city is divided. The others are 
appointed by the governor, two on the recommendation of the board of trustees of thehigh 
school and two on that of the trustees of the College of the City of Charleston. The board, 
as before, chooses a superintendent to assist in the work of supervision and in other re- 
spects retains all its former powers and duties. 
STATISTICS. 
The poptilation of Charleston, according to the Census of 1880, was 49,984; the whole 
number of children attending public schools in 1882 was 5,904 and the average daily 
attendance 3,789, under 94 teachers. Six schools were in operation during most of the 
year, an increase of one since the last report, and $62,144 were expended for them. + 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
A new school building was erected, of brick, three stories high, with basement, contain- 
ing 3 large main rooms and 14 class rooms, besides the necessary cloak rooms. The two 
colored schools are still suffering from lack of sufficient accommodations, but a plan is in 
contemplation which will relieve them. The superintendent recommends the establish- 
ment of a reformatory school for the education of neglected children, many of whom as 
young as 12 are now found in the jails. 
Of other schools not belonging to the public system but doing important work the 
Holy Communion Church Institute reports 136 boarding and 110 day pupils; the Central 
Catholic School for Boys, 376; the Society Street School for Girls, 280; and St. Peter’s 
School for Colored Children, 110. The first named, founded in 1867 by Rev. A. T. Porter

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS. 
Four schools of this class report 325 normal students and 40 graduates during the year, 
besides 696 students in other courses. 
Of these the Avery Normal Institute, Charleston (first opened in 1865), with 50 normal 
pupils, presents courses of 3 and 4 years, the latter with the addition of foreign languages. 
The normal department of Allen University, Columbia (opened in 1881), with 115 nor- 
mal pupils, offers a 3-year normal course, including drawing and music, and has a model 
school attached. = 
The normal department of Claflin University, Orangeburg, organized in 1868, reports 
59 normal pupils and 10 graduates, the course covering 3 years and including music and 
drawing. It has a model school attached. 
Fairfield Normat Institute, Winnsboro’, first opened in 1869 and mainly supported by 
the Presbyterian committee of freedmen, at Pittsburgh, Pa., gave instruction to 101 nor- 
mal pupils. There is a model school attached to the institute and music and drawing 
are a part of the normal course, but the length of this course is not fixed. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Teachers’ associations have been formed in several counties, and some of these are 
called teachers’ institutes; but only in one county was any attempt made to give the in- 
struction usually imparted in such institutes. This was held during the month of July 
in Edgefield County, the expenses being defrayed by voluntary contributions from citi- 
zens, with $100 from the Peabody fund. 
A State institute for white teachers was held in August at Columbia, under the char; 
of Hon. M. A. Newell, of Maryland, and one for colored teachers was held in Columbia 
during July, superintended by H. P. Montgomery, of Washington. Good results attended 
both. The former had 306 members enrolled, representing 22 counties, several students 
also being from North Carolina; the latter reported about 235 attending.— (State report.) 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State superintendent makes no definite statement as to the existence of public high 
schools, but says that 4,307 children in the public schools were studying the higher 
branches. The two schools at Charleston enrolled, respectively, 389 girls and 121 boys. 
The changes recently made in the management of the school for boys, among others mak- 
ing thestudy of Latin compulsory and requiting pupils to maintain a standard of at least 
50 percent. in recitations, have worked well. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of private academic schools, preparatory schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges reporting, see Tables VI, VII, and IX of the appendix, and for sum- 
maries, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Eight colleges and universities report for the year 1881-82, as follows: the College 
of Charleston, Charleston, (non-sectarian); Erskine College, Due West (Associate Re- 
formed Presbyterian); Furman University, Greenville (Baptist); Newberry College, 
Newberry (Evangelical Lutheran); Claflin University, Orangeburg (Methodist Episco- 
pal); Wofford College, Spartanburg (Methodist Episcopal South); Adger College, Wal- 
halla (Presbyterian), and Allen University, Columbia (Methodist), The last, organized 
in April, 1881, for colored students, presents primary, intermediate, and classical collegiate 
departments, besides legal, theological, and normal. The others report courses substan- 
tially the same as those of the previous year, all having preparatory and classical depart- 
ments, although in two, Wofford College and Firman University, the arrangement of 
studies is that of independent schools, with no fixed time for graduation. Scientific 
departments are found in 3 and special or partial courses in 4, while 1 had a philosoph- 
ical, 1 a normal, and 1 an agricultural course. Claflin and Allen Universities admit 
young women as well as men. 
Gifts were reported by Claflin University and Adger and Erskine Colleges as follows:
-P-A-G-E-533

by Claflin, from individual friends, $1,671; from the Freedmen’s Aid Society, $2,000; 
by Adger, $525; and by Erskine, 350 acres of land from Rev. John Wilson, Monticello, 
Ark. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Six colleges and seminaries for the superior instruction of young women, 5 of them 
authorized to confer collegiate degrees, report for 1881~’82 an aggregate of 453 students 
in regular collegiate classes, besides nearly 200 in other courses. ‘The institutions re- 
ferred to are Anderson Female Seminary, Anderson; Columbia Female College, Columbia; 
Due West Female College, Due West; Greenville Female College, Greenville; Walhalla 
Female College, Walhalla, and Williamston Female College, Willianiston. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC, 
The South Carolina College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Columbia, for white 
pupils, presents 3 departments of study; regular courses of 4 years, leading to the de- 
grees of B. A. and B. S.; special courses of 2 years; and elective ones, subject to the 
consent of the faculty. The regular courses are divided, according to the predominant 
studies, into two principal groups, scientific and literary, in each of which some choice 
is allowed. Thescientific group embraces courses in general science, in engineering, and 
in agriculture, the studies in all 3 being identical for the first 2 yeas. About 30 acres 
of land are available for the illustration of work in the departments of agriculture and 
horticulture. 
Claflin University (for colored students) offers, besides its classical and normal courses, a 
3-year course in science and agriculture, especially adapted to the wants of young men 
that desire a higher education for industrial pursuits. About 150 acres of choice land, 
mostly under cultivation, are connected with the college. There is also a carpenter’s 
shop for practical instruction. Scientific and industrial education are practically united 
here, and students may aid materially in defraying their expenses by manual labor on 
the farm and in the shop.— (Catalogue, 1881-82.) 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Theological instruction was offered in Baker Theological Institute, Orangeburg (Metho- 
dist Episcopal); in Allen University, Columbia (Methodist), established in 1881 and re- 
porting a 3-year course of study, which includes Greek, Hebrew, and French; and in 
Benedict Institute, Columbia (Baptist), which reports a 3-year course of study, with 33 
students in it. The Theological Seminary at Columbia (Presbyterian), suspended for 2 
years, reports encouraging progress made in the work of restoring the endowment; 2 
additional professors had been elected and the seminary was to be reopened in Septem- 
ber, 1882. 
Legal instruction was begun in 1881-’82 by Allen University, Columbia, which reports 
a course of study extending over 2 years of 33 weeks each and 8 students enrolled, 1 of 
whom had received a collegiate degree. 
Medical.—The Medical College of the State of South Carolina, Columbia (regular), 
opened in 1833, reports the usual 3-year medical course of study, including 2 courses of 
lectures of 21 weeks each, with 61 pupils enrolled during the year and 19 graduates. 
A department in pharmacy has recently been established by the above medical college. 
The faculty, already elected, comprised a professor of chemistry, one of materia medica 
and medical botany, one of practical pharmacy, and an assistant in pharmaceutical and 
practical chemistry. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The South Carolina Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Cedar Springs, 
founded in 1849, reports 48 deaf and dumb and 12 blind pupils for the year. 
The course of instruction for the deaf comprises geography, penmanship, arithmetic, 
English grammar, history, natural philosophy, biblical and general literature, and articu- 
lation, besides such employments as shoemaking, printing, sewing, and household work. 
The pupils in articulation, commencing in 1879-’80, have made steady progress; they 
can read quite readily from the lips almost any simple sentence and speak many sen- 
tences with sufficient distinctness to be understood with little difficulty. 
The blind are taught music, as well as the English branches; also, mattress making, 
bead ae fancy work, broom niaking, brush making, and chair seating.— (Returns and

EDUCATION OF ORPHANS. 
Two institutions for fhe care and education of orphans report, viz: the Holy Communion 
Church Institute, Charleston, already noted, and the Thornwell Orphanage, Clinton. The

latter is under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church and is supported by contributions 
and an endowment of $5,000. Children are received from 6 to 13; they are taught all 
domestic work, farming, carpentry, and printing, and leave the institution at 16 or 18 
years of age. There were 34 children under instruction during the year. The family 
plan is followed, only 15 or 20 children being kept in a house, a matron and teacher 
being in charge of each house. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The law makes it the duty ef county school commissioners to encourage the holding 
of teachers’ associations throughout the State, and two State institutes, one for white 
and oné for colored teachers, were held during the year, as already noted, in which much 
practical instruction was given and many topics bearing on school work were discussed.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
  For general supervision there is a State superintendent of public schools, nominated 
biennially by the governor and confirmed by the senate. For local supervision a super- 
intendent for each county is chosen by the county court biennially, and in each district 
the people choose one out of 3 directors annually after the first election of the three. The 
16E
-P-A-G-E-536
  242 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
law requires State and county superintendents to be persons of literary and scientific 
attainments and of skill and experience in the art of teaching. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are free to all youth of school age (6-21), but, as elsewhere at the 
South, schools for white and colored must be separate. he studies in them include 
only the ordinary branches, with vocal music, elementary geology of Tennessee, and ele- 
mentary principles of agriculture, though other and higher branches may be provided 
for by local taxation or be allowed by special regulations on the payment of tuition fees. 
The union of public schools with academies and colleges allowed by law facilitates such 
arrangements. Toe receive pay from public funds, however, each teacher must hold a cer- 
tificate of qualification from the county or city superintendent under whom he or she 
may be employed. The State aids the schools with the annual proceeds of a State fund 
of over $2,500,000, of a poll tax of $1 on each voter, and of a property tax of a mill on each 
$1, all distributed on the basis of scholastic population. If from these sources there 
should not be enough to sustain schools 5 months in the year, the county courts, of their 
own motion or following a vote of the people, may levy an additional tax to keep them 
open for that time or longer, the whole amount, however, not to exceed the entire sum 
raised as State tax. The non-obligatory character of the levy is the point in the system 
which is especially weak, the counties that most need additional school facilities often 
being the foremost to reject a proposition which would provide needed school facilities. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The report of school affairs for 1882 isnot encouraging. Perhaps from a succession of 
rapid changes in the office of State superintendent of public schools—an experienced man 
being retired, his successor dying, and a third coming in after an interval of vacancy — 
many counties failed to present full returns of school attendance. This was the case in 
1881 as well as in 1882, but to so much greater a degree in the latter year as to nearly in- 
validate the comparisons made between the two. Partly from this cause, partly it would 
seem from lack of interest in some counties that presented their returns, the figures given 
indicate a falling off of 19,112 in public school enrolment, of 28 in the number of graded. 
public schools, of 140 in consolidated schools, of 338 in public school-houses, of 1,193in 
teachers for public school classes, and of $1.94 in the average monthly pay of teachers. 
There is no report of average attendance for public schools. Private schools continued 
to report this item and showed in these reports a good percentage of average attend- 
ance on enrolment; but, as in the public schools, there was a large diminution in the 
enrolment and in the average attendance. Only in the average time of public schools, 
in the valuation of school property, and in income and expenditures are there any 
evidences of educational advancement. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
Tennessee had from this source in 1881—’82 $12,800, namely: $2,300 for public schools, 
$1,500 for teachers’ institutes, and $9,000 for the Normal College, Nashville. This last 
is an important means of furthering educational interests throughout the South generally 
by training for progressive school work teachers sent to it from the other States on 
Peabody scholarships. 
    KINDERGARTEN. 
Only one school of this class in the State is on the list of this Bureau for 1882, the 
Memphis Kindergarten in the Young Ladies’ School of Mrs. F. C. James, and no report 
from it has been received for 1882. Another formerly existed at the Nashville Acad- 
emy, but it appears to have been dropped.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Chattanooga reported for 1881-’82 graded schools in 8 buildings containing 37 school 
rooms. The youth of school age were 2,178 white and 1,230 colored, of which number 
1,638 white and 942 colored were enrolled in the public schools, a gain of 246. The 
schools were taught 1643 days (a gain of 64 days) by 7 men and 31 women, a gain of 4 
teachers. The high school presents a, 3-year course, including German and Latin, from 
which course.14-were graduated im 1882. School property was valued at $39,750. An 
enrolment of 350 was reported in private and church Schools. 
Knocville had its 27 graded schools in 5 buildings, with 1,360 sittings. The schools 
were taught 189}-days-by 5 men and 25 women. The estimated value of school property 
was $49,200. Private and church school enrolment was 100. 
Memphis reported graded schools in 11 buildings, with 67 rooms and 3,200sittings. The 
number of white school children was 6,370; of colored, 4,872; white pupils enrolled, 
2,171; colored, 1,777. The average attendance of white children was 1,600; of colored, 
1,071. The schools were taught 165 days by 9 men and 58 women. The high school 
ior whites enrolled 71 and had an average belonging of 60 and an average attendance of 
57. Calisthenics and singing were introduced as a part of the exercises in the public 
schools. 
Nashville divided its schools into primary, intermediate, grammar, and high, the first 3 
departments occupying 7 years, the last)1,3., Thirteen school-houses—the same number 
reported last year — with 6,000 sittings, were occupied by the city schools. ‘These schools 
were taught 185 days by 15 men and 84 women, with 2 special teachers, 1 of music and 
1 of drawing and penmanship. The school population had decreased 1,352; but not- 
withstanding this the enrolment inereased 200 and average attendance 197. There were 
72 boysand 184 girls in the high school taught by 8 teachers. Private and church schools 
enrolled 500 children. The valuation of public school property was $195,000. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The State Normal College (so called, though no aid was received from the State up to 
1882) is a department of the University of Nashville and is supported by university 
funds, by the Peabody education fund, and by appropriations of the different States for 
scholarships. It receives from the States students of either sex, who, for admission, 
must declare their intention to become teachers and pass a satisfactory examination in 
the common English branches. The course of study, covering 3 years, is strictly pro- 
fessional, and students are required in every study to occupy temporarily the place of 
teacher and subject themselves to criticism as to the methods they employ. Students . 
completing the full course receive the degree of “‘licentiate of instruction,’’ and may 
teach in the public schools of Tennessee and some other States without further examina- 
tion. An advanced or baccalaureate course of one year, that leads to the degree of B. A., 
is.optional. Twenty-five scholarships of $100 each annually have been established by 
the State for the training of teachers for its schools. The funds for a number of other 
scholarships for different States have been supplied by the Peabody fund. 
There were 12 other institutions reporting normal departments or normal courses, viz: 
East Tennessee Wesleyan University, Athens; Humboldt Normal Institute, Humboldt; 
Warner Institute, Jonesboro’; Knoxville College, Knoxville; Freedman’s Normal Insti- 
tute and Maryville College, both at Maryville; Le Moyne Normal Institute, Memphis; 
Morristown Seminary, Morristown, and Fisk University, Nashville, both for colored 
students; Nashville Institute and Roger Williams University, both at Nashville; and 
Winchester Normal, Winchester. For statistics of such of these schools as report them, 
see Table III of the appendix; for a summary of these statistics, a corresponding table 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
Fifty scholarships of $50 each were established in 1882 at Fisk University. A normal 
class of teachers is required to meet the city superintendent monthly or oftener at Nash- 
ville, for the discussion of studies and methods of teaching. 
SUMMER NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
The State Normal Institute at the: University of Tennessee, Knoxville, was held in 
June and July, 1882, and, owing to the death of the president, Rev. W. S. Doak, D. D., 
was conducted by the vice president, 8. H. Lockett. There were 183 attendants, of 
which number 120 were teachers in public schools. Instruction in the branches taught 
in these schoo!s was given, while optional courses were offered in languages, botany, 
physiology, and penmanship. Lectures were delivered on school organization and man- 
agement, embracing “‘ Public school law,’’ ‘‘ Rights and duties of teachers,” ‘‘Grading of 
city and county schools,” ‘‘ Management and discipline of schools,” ‘Best methods of 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-538
244 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
school teaching,’’ &. Some time was also devoted to an explanation of the Roman 
method of pronouncing Latin. The institute was well organized and successful, the 
lectures and teaching in the different branches being highly satisfactory. 
‘Two normal institutes for colored teachers were held in June and July, 1882, one at 
Le Moyne Institute, Memphis, the other at Knoxville. The attendance at the former 
was 126; at the latter, 44. Instruction was given in the common school branches, and at 
the examination most of the students obtained good grades.  Instructive lectures were 
delivered, much earnest work was done, and great interest was manifested. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Educational Record, first issued at Nashville in August, 1881, was continued 
through 1882, but appears to have then ceased. In its place there was proposed the Ten- 
nessee Journal of Education, to be conducted by the former State superintendent, Hon. 
Leon. Trousdale. The Southern Teacher was begun in the latter part of 1882 at Hollow 
Rock, but soon changed its title to West Tennessee Normal. An educational journal 
has for many years been published at Columbia, in the interests of thé Columbia Athe- 
neum, called The Guardian, and devoted to the cause of female education, especially in 
that school. 
SECONDARY TRAINING. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The State report does not give statistics of schools of this class, but the cities of Chat- 
tanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, and Nashville reported-high-:schools in 1882. All had 
3-year courses, which included Latin. The total enrolment was 411 and included both 
sexes, Duty ‘whether separately taught or not does not appear, except at Knoxville and 
Memphis, where they were separate. The State allows academies and colleges uncon- 
nected with its school system to teach public school pupils at public school rates, by 
arrangements to that effect with school officers, and in this way some high school 
instruction is probably given. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For information as to business colleges, private academic sthools, schools specially 
engaged in preparing pupils for college, and preparatory departments of universities or 
colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of appendix. For a summary of the statistics 
of such schools, see corresponding tables in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SE} 
  Es. 
The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for young men, has subcollegiate courses in 
classical, scientific, and Latin scientific studies, of undefined length, with collegiate gen- 
eral courses in arts and sciences of 4 years; technical courses in engineering, agriculture, 
chemistry, and biology, also of 4 years; and special courses, including selections from 
these, of 2 years each. The collegiate courses all lead to their customary degrees, at grad- 
uation, beyond which there are graduate degrees of M. A., PH. D., C. E., and M. D., that 
require one to two years of resident graduate study. Honor scholarships, with exemp- 
tion from all university fees, are offered to the student standing first in the third year of 
any one of the 4 specified courses. 
Of the 19 other colleges, 10 were for both sexes and 9 for young men only. Central 
Tennessee College and Fisk University, both of Nashville, were for colored students. 
Allin the State gave preparatory instruction, with 4-year collegiate courses. Fourteen 
had scientific courses; 11, commercial; 12, instruction in modern languages; and 10, in the 
fine arts. Five presented graduate courses and 6 offered normal training. 
For statistics of colleges reporting, see Table IX of the appendix; for a summary of 
their statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. - 
Of the 20 colleges and universities in the State 10 admit both sexes, Maryville giving 
a 4-year ladies’ course. Of the 20 on the lists of this Bureau, only 16 reported for 1882. 
Most of them present courses of from 4 to 7 years and have arrangements for teaching 
music, drawing, painting, and modern languages. 
For statistics of those reporting, see Table VIII of the appendix; fora summary of their 
statistics, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State University and Agricultural College, Knoxville, presented in 1882 courses 
of 4 years each in civil engineering, mechanical and mining engineering, agriculture, 
andapplied chemistry. There were also special courses of 2 years each in practical agri- 
culture and applied mathematics and an English science course. In the first named, stu- 
dents combine class instruction with farm training and are graded and remunerated 
according to their skill. Scientific courses were offered in 15 other collegiate institutions, 
white Cumberland University, Lebanon; Vanderbilt University, Nashville; and the Uni- 
versity of the South, Sewanee, presented courses in engineering. 
For statistics of scientific schools: reporting, see Table X of the appendix; for a sum- 
mary of their statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction was reported in 1882 in full 3-year courses at East Tennessee 
Wesleyan University, Athens; Central Tennessee College and Vanderbilt University, 
Nashville (both Methodist); Southwestern Presbyterian University, Clarksville; Fisk 
University, Nashville (Congregational); and at the University of the South, Sewanee 
(Protestant Episcopal). Southwestern University offered also 2 years of study in Greek 
and Hebrew and Vanderbilt a 2-year English course. Cumberland University, Leba- 
non (Cumberland Presbyterian), gave a 2-year course in theology, including Greek and 
Hebrew. Burritt College, Spencer (Christian), and Southwestern Baptist University, 
Jackson, offered biblical instruction, indefinite as to time. 
Legal instruction was offered in the law school of Cumberland University, Lebanon; 
also, in the law departments of Central Tennessee College and Vanderbilt University, 
both in Nashville. The first named, opened in 1847, offers a 2-year course, which it is 
said, however, may be completed in 10 months. There were 40 students graduated in 
1882 and invited to remain another year free of charge. The second, organized in 1880, 
has a course of 2 years of 32 weeks each year. There were 11 students graduated in 1882. 
The medical schools reporting are Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee 
College (for colored students, both sexes), Nashville Medical College (a department of 
the State University), and the medical departments of Vanderbilt University and the 
University of Nashville, all offering a 3-year course of siudy, with 2 courses of lectures 
of 20 weeks each, except Meharry, which has only 19 weeks. 
Dentistry was taught in the Dental School of the University of Tennessee and at Van- 
derbilt University, each requiring attendance upon 2 lecture courses of 20 weeks each, 
with approved dental work. Vanderbilt admits women to this department. 
Pharmacy is also offered at Vanderbilt, with 3 hours’ laboratory work, attendance 
upon 2 full courses of lectures of about 21 weeks each, and an original thesis for grad- 
uation. There were 5 graduates in 1882, who received the degree of PH. G. 
For statistics of professional schools, see Tables XI, XII, and XIII of the appendix. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Tennessee School for the Deaf and Dumb, Knoxville, opened for instruction in 
1845 and free to all deaf-mute residents of the State of school age, reported 64 boys 
and 38 girls in 1882, under the instruction of 5 men and 2 women, 3 teachers being 
deaf-mutes. ‘The common school branches were taught 5 hours each day, one class be- 
ing taught by the articulation method; printing and shoemaking -were also taught, and 
gardening to some extent. The State appropriated $22,500 for the year. Estimated 
value of buildings, grounds, &c., $150,000. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind, Nashville, reported 58 pupils for 1881-’82, of 
which number 8 were colored. Common English and some of the higher branches were 
taught, also vocal and instrumental music, and training for piano tuning and various 
other industrial employments was provided. The State appropriated $40,000 for the 
year. A site and buildings were purchased at a cost of $8,586 for a home for colored 
pupils. The total expendituyes for 1882 were $31,287. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Thg Austin School, formerly the Knoxville Industrial School, established by Miss E. 
L, Austin in connection with the colored public school at Knoxville, reported 314 
pupils for 1881-’82 in the sewing school and 114 in the kitchen garden and classes for 
calisthenics. Two-thirds of the children were under 12 years of age. The school was 
taught 172 days by 2 teachers and reported fair progress.

EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
TENNESSEE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
  The seventeenth annual session of the State Teachers’ Association was held in Morris- 
towi, August 17 and 18, 1882, Dr. William A. Smith presiding. The meeting was 
largely attended, representatives being present from all parts of the State. The subjects 
presented for discussion were ‘‘ Morals and religion in school;’’ ‘‘ National aid to pub- 
Jie schools; ’’ ‘‘Teacher’s salary;”’ ‘‘ Neglect of the plant for the sake of the flower;”’ 
‘*Progressive education;’? ‘‘ Practical education;”’ ‘Practical elocution;’’ and ‘‘ What 
is anormal school?’’ After much discussion, a committee was appointed to examine 
the present school law, to see what revisions and amendments were necessary to improve 
the school system, and to bring the matter before the legislature. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
DR. W. S. DOAK. 
  When the governor of Tennessee, in March, 1881, presented to the legislature this 
respected president of Tusculum College, Greeneville, as his nominee for the State super- 
intendency of public schools, while many regretted the retirement of Hon. Leon. Trous- 
dale, who had served with great fidelity from 1874, all hoped for much success in school 
work under Dr. Doak. He was known to have displayed great ability as a teacher 
and college president and to devote himself unsparingly to whatever work he under- 
took. Such a preparation and such character gave promise of the happiest results for 
the school system which he was called on to supervise and stimulate; and for some 
time it seemed that these results would be secured, as he went heartily into his work, 
planned wisely for it, and made favorable impressions upon most of those with whom 
he came in contact; but the duties of a superintendent of public schools ina large State 
like Tennessee, with but one assistant, are laborious and exhausting, and Dr. Deak was 
past his prime when he undertook them. Long journeys and exacting office work, there- 
fore, soon told on him. Malarious disease, contracted through exposure, could not be 
shaken off. After a time he went back-to his college home at Tusculum, convinced that 
if his life was to be saved it must be through complete rest for a time from his official 
duties. But it was too late, and he died there May 23, 1882, after occupying his high 
office only about 14 months. Dr. Doak was the third college president in lineal succes- 
sion of his family: his grandfather, of the same name, not only founded the first school 
west of the mountains (afterward Washington College), but Tusculum College also, in 
which his son, Dr. Samuel Doak, succeeded him as president, the subject of this sketch, 
a graduate of the college and of Danville Theological Seminary, Kentucky, following as 
president from 1867 to 1881. 
JOHN MERCHANT STURTEVANT. 
For almost 32 years the faithful and efficient principal of the Tennessee School for the 
Blind, at Nashville, Mr. Sturtevant died there, December 26, 1882, in the fifty-eighth 
year of his age. Born March 23, 1825, in Mattapoisett, Mass., he was so unfortunate 
as to lose his sight from the effects of an accident when he was less than 10 years old. 
But with indomitable will he pursued his studies, first at the Massachusetts School for 
the Blind in Boston, then at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire (where he graduated 
in the first third of the class of 1846), and finally at the Bridgewater State Normal School, 
Mass., where he went to acquaint himself with the best methods of teaching. Return- 
ing to the Massachusetts School for the Blind, where he had taught already with much 
suecess and where he had succeeded in training a blind deaf-mute to articulate, he re- 
sumed his teaching with increased success, and continued it till January, 1851, when he 
was called to fill the principalship of the school at Nashville, which he subsequently 
occupied until his death. It was an unpromising work at the beginning, with only a 
poorly furnished rented building, with few pupils, and with very slender pay. But Mr. 
Sturtevant engaged in the undertaking with the energy of his noble Puritan ancestor, 
Miles Standish, and, finding that the legislature had the year before appropriated $4,000 
toward the erection of a building for the school, he succeeded in getting an additional 
$8,000 voted for the purchase of a site and the completion of the building. To thiy 
building, on a site purchased from the University of Nashville, the school (then increased 
to 26 pupils) was transferred in January, 1853, and there it flourished under the judicious
-P-A-G-E-541
TENNESSEE, 247 
leadership of its new principal till the outbreak of the civil war in 1861. Early in 1862 
the school building was taken for a military hospital by the confederate authorities; then 
for the same purpose by the Federal forces, by whom it was finally destroyed. Such 
blind orphan children as remained were thus thrown upon the care of the blind princi- 
pal, and, finding boarding places for them in the country, he supplied them as well as 
possible with clothing during the remaining years of the war. To secure the means for 
supporting and clothing these poor wards he twice took long pedestrian journeys, one 
trip lasting six weeks, pursuing the shifting State authorities and urging on them their 
duty to these children. To the credit of the authorities it must be said that they prom- 
ised him at his first visit the means he sought and at the second provided them, he ac- 
counting fully, at the conclusion of the war, for every dollar thus obtained and they 
giving him again an appropriation to revive and carry on the school. With buildings 
gone, furniture largely destroyed, and pupils scattered, this was a heavy task, but Mr. 
Sturtevant proved equal to it. He rented new quarters, found and utilized whatever 
old furniture was left, sent out for scholars, urged the legislature and friends to action, 
and in 1867 had 16 pupils; in 1869, 37; and in 1871, 40, with a workshop for industrial 
employment. In 1873 he secured a new site of 7 acres for the school by a generous gift 
of Hon. John M. Lea and wife, and persuaded the legislature to give $40,000 for the 
erection of the necessary buildings, on a plan that would admit of indefinite extension. 
In 1881 he crowned his long labors by obtaining from the legislature the means for en- 
Jarging and improving the school and for a separate building for the colored blind. 
Worn out with long exertion and stricken with paralysis on the very day of his assured 
success, he died within a year.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Public schools are under the control of a State board of education, composed of the 
governor, the secretary of state, and the State comptroller. The board is authorized to 
appoint some competent person as secretary, who is paid $2,000 a year.
-P-A-G-E-543
  TEXAS. 249 
County school affairs are superintended by county judges, who perform the duties 
usually devolving on county superintendents. The county judge of each county also 
appoints annually a board of examiners, consisting of 3 well educated citizens, for the 
examination of teachers. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The funds set apart for the support of public schools are the interest of the public school 
fund, not more than one-fourth of the general revenue, and a poll tax of $1 on all men 
21 to 60 years of age. These funds are distributed to the several counties in proportion 
to their school population (8 to 14), white and colored. Each race must receive its 
just proportion of the funds and must share equally in school privileges, but must be 
taught in separate schovls, any mixed school being even forbidden to receive aid from 
the school funds, as is also any school in which sectarian religion is taught. In cities 
and towns, if two-thirds of the taxpayers so decide, an additional sum may be raised by 
local taxation to keep the schools open 10 months, but such tax must not exceed one- 
half of 1 per cent. on the city property. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The secretary of the State board reports a steady progress in public school affairs. 
Very little idea as to this can be gained, however, from a comparison of such statistics 
as are available, on account of the incompleteness of the returns. The records for 1881 
were destroyed by a fire that consumed the capitol, but duplicates of them were re- 
ceived from 109 counties, 127 reporting for 1882, out of 166 that maintained schools. 
Of 45 cities and towns having control of their own schools only 13 sentreports. Such neg- 
lect suggests to the State board of education the necessity of a law which shall require re- 
ports to be made as a condition of receiving compensation by those whose duty it is to re- 
port. County judges complain of great difficulty in getting teachers to make out their term 
reports in proper form and in due time, and in many instances give this as a reason for 
the delay in sending their own reports. It is believed also that the law relating to the 
organization and government of schools by cities and towns is too general in its terms to 
produce uniformity and to give assurance that the objects of the school law will be car- 
ried out; that it, in effect, delegates to the cities and towns the power which the consti- 
tution confers on the legislature of having the school funds which are distributed to 
each county applied as provided by law. The authorities of such cities and towns are 
under no obligation to report to the board of education the manner in which the schools 
are organized or in which the State money is applied; consequently the legislature 
cannot be informed in regard to either. Another subject of complaint is inregard to the 
uncertainty as to exactly what is meant by the expression ‘‘sectarian school’? in the 
constitution. County judgesare not furnished with any guide except their own judg- 
ment in determining what is or is not a sectarian school, and this will continue to be a 
source of dissatisfaction until the legislature shall have passed a law defining such a 
school, 
AID FROM PEABODY FUND. 
During the year ending October 1, 1882, $17,500 were disbursed by the trustees of 
this fund in aid of education in this State, as follows: For teachers’ institutes, $500; for 
public schools, $6,900; for educational journal, $200; to Sam Houston Normal Institute, 
$6,950; and for Nashville scholarships, $2,950. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
The councils or boards of aldermen of cities and towns are invested with exclusive power 
to maintain, regulate, control, and governall the public free schools within their limits. 
Austin, Galveston, Houston, and others of the larger cities have school superintendents.

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Austin reports 26 schools, maintaining 19 of them for white children and 7 for colored, 
their average term being 8 months. The schools occupied 9 school-houses, of which 3 
belonged to the city. Teachers were paid from $50 to $65 a month; the average rate of 
tuition for white children was $1.43; for colored, $1.35. 
In Galveston, public schools were taught 184 days in 9 school buildings, of which 4 were 
owned and 5 rented, the number of sittings for study being 2,600. 
Houston had 29 public schools, classed as primary, grammar, and high, 18 of them for 
white children and 11 for colored, taught in 12 buildings belonging to the city, 10 of 
frame and 2 of brick. Teachers were paid from $35 to $122 a month. The average rate 
of tuition for white pupils was $1.41; for colored, $0.78. ;   
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The third annual session of the Sam Houston Normal Institute opened in September, 
1881, with 165 students, of whom 130 (4 from each senatorial district and 6 from the 
State at large) were State students, who were received for one year without expenseeven 
for board and lodging. Tuition and books are free to all who attend; but students must 
pledge themselves to teach in the public schools for as many sessions as they have at- 
tended the institute. Applicants for admission must, if young men, be at least 20 years 
of age, if young women, 18; and they must pass a satisfactory examination in orthogra- 
phy, reading, penmanship, arithmetic, geography, English grammar and composition, 
and the history of the United States. The full course of study extends over 3 yearsand 
comprises. an elementary, an advanced, and a graduate year. State certificates, good 
throughout the State, are granted by the board on recommendation of the faculty; also, 
first, second, and third class certificates, on the attainment of such proficiency as would 
secure like certificates from a county board of examiners. 
From the State Normal School of Texas for Colored Students, Prairie View, no infor- 
mation has been received for 1882. 
OTHER NORMAL INSTRUCTION, 
Tillotson Normal Institute, Austin, under the American Missionary Association, having 
a normal course of 4 years, the completion of which entitles a student to a normal 
ape reports 50 students during the year, under 6 instructors. 
e American Normal School, Kellyville, organized in 1878, but not chartered, reports 
assistance to the amount of about $150 received during thedyear from the State. There 
was one instructor, but the number of students is not given. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
A much larger number of institutes, or summer normal schools, was held during 1882 
than the previous year, and very encouraging reports of the results are given. Teachers 
of private as well as public schools attended and hy their labors contributed to the success 
of the work. Eighteen institutes were sustained in different parts of the State, and their 
advantages were generally appreciated, the interest being greatest in the smaller places. 
The success attending them was considered a strong argument for their maintenance in 
succeeding years. Still, the class of teachers most in need of the training thus afforded 
was absent, and it was felt that to be of the greatest use these institutes must reach the 
rural teachers. It was thought, also, that 6 weeks is too long a term, and sessions of 4 
weeks are recommended for the future, 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Texas Journal of Education, a monthly published at Austin by Hon. O. N. Hol- 
lingsworth, secretary of the State board of education, was devoted to educational subjects 
generally and gave special information in regard to normal schools and teachers’ insti- 
tutes in 1882. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
No definite information is at hand in regard to public high schools; but from the State 
report it appears that 227 pupils were instructed in the public schools in algebra, 109 in 
geometry, and 153 in natural philosophy. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For information as to business colleges, private academies, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges reporting, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix; for summaries 
of their statistics, see the report of the Commissioner preceding.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The collegiate institutions reporting are St. Mary’s University, Galveston; South- 
western University, Georgetown; Baylor University, Independence; Salado College, Sa- 
Jado; Mansfield Male and Female College, Mansfield; Austin College, Sherman; Trinity 
University, Tehuacana; Waco University, Waco; and Marvin College, Waxahachie. All 
report preparatory departments and collegiate courses of 4 years. While some have the 
collegiate curriculum arranged in separate schools, all report studies that correspond to 
the classical course, leading to the degree of A. B.; Shad scientific courses; 4, commercial; 
1, a philosophical; 2, separate courses for young women; 3, courses in theology; and 1, a 
course in law. Music was taught by 3 and the modern languages by 7. Five admitted 
both sexes, and 4 of these had 270 young women enrolled in regular collegiate classes, 
the whole number of undergraduates reported by 8 iistitutions out of the 9 named being 
961. Mansfield Male and Female College does not give the number of collegiate students 
apart from those in the preparatory department. 
Gifts were received during the year by the Southwestern University of $5,000 from 
citizens of Georgetown, to erect a college chapel, and by Trinity University of $5,000 in 
notes, payable in 10 annual instalments. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Besides the opportunities for securing a higher education afforded to young women in 
5 colleges above noted, 6 institutions are reported exclusively for them, all authorized to 
confer collegiate degrees, viz: Dallas Female College, Dallas; Young Ladies’ School of 
Southwestern University, Georgetown; Woodlawn Female College, Paris; Nazareth 
Academy, Victoria; Baylor Female College, Independence; and Ursuline Academy, Gal- 
veston. ‘Two of these schools were under the influence of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
South, 2 under the Roman Catholic, 1 under the Baptist, and 1 reports itself non-secta- 
rian. 
A gift was received during the year by the Young Ladies’ School of Southwestern Uni- 
versity of $600 from citizens of Georgetown, to improve the buildings, and one by Baylor 
Female College of $5,000 from citizens of Independence and other friends, part of it 
being in buildings and land, the remainder in money. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas presents two courses of 3 years each 
in agriculture and mechanics. All students must enter one of these courses, pay stu- 
dents making their own selection, State students being assigned in accordance with their 
appointments. Of the latter, 3 are appointed from each senatorial district of the State, 
one-half of such students being obliged to take an agricultural and the other half a 
mechanical course of study, to be assigned thereto by the president of the college. 
Optional courses in the ancient and modern languages are open to students without 
extra charge. The college tract consists of 2,416 acresof land. The mechanical depart- 
ment comprises carpenter, forge, and vise shops; wood working and metal working 
machine shops, and one of steam enginery, all thoroughly equipped with the necessary 
tools and machinery. There were 258 students attending during the year, of whom 93 
held State scholarships. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction is given in the theological department of Baylor University 
(Baptist), which reports7 students, under 2 professors; also, in Trinity University (Cum- 
berland Presbyterian) and Waco University (Baptist), some provision is made for the 
training of young men to the work of the ministry, but the number under instruction in 
this branch during 1881-82 was not reported. 
Legal instruction was given in Baylor University, though to what extent does not 
appear clearly from the catalogue at hand. There was, however, a professor of common 
and statute law and equity jurisprudence, and among the alumni were reported 31 grad- 
uates in law. 
No medical institutions report from this State since the suspension of the Texas Med- 
ical College and Hospital, Galveston. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Texas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Austin, organized in 
1857, had 110 pupils during 1882, under 7 teachers; the whole number of pupils taught 
since organization being 243. The branches studied were spelling, reading, writing,

arithmetic, geography, grammar, composition, and history. Pupils were also tanght 
such employments as printing, shoemaking, farming, gardening, care of stock, sewing, 
crocheting, embroidery, knitting, and household work. The institution owned 57 acres 
of land, valued with buildings at about $70,000. Out of $27,920 expended during the 
year, $24,960 were from the State.— (Return.) 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Texas Institution of Learning for the Blind isa free school maintained by the State 
for the benefit of blind children of rich and poor alike. Three departments are main- 
tained, literary, musical, and mechanical, the first comprising the elementary English 
branches with some of the higher. In the musical department instruction is given in 
vocal music and in the use of various instruments, including the piano, violin, bass viol, 
cornet, clarionet, and flute. The employments taught are broom, mattress, and pillow 
making, chair seating, and the tuning of pianos and organs. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
STATE ASSOCIATION. 
The State Teachers’ Association which met at Tyler, June 28, 1882, was more largely 
attended than any previous meeting of the body. -Great interest, as well as harmony, 
characterized the proceedings; interesting papers were read and earnest and forcible 
speeches delivered on appropriate topics. Galveston was selected as the place for holding 
the next regular session.

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The chief educational officer is a State superintendent of education, elected by each 
biennial general assembly; town superintendents, who report to the selectmen, are elected 
for 1-year terms; in counties there are examining boards; in districts, moderators, clerks, 
collectors of taxes, treasurers, 1 or 3 auditors, and prudential committees. In towns 
where the district system has been abolished there are boards of 3 directors. Any town 
having a high or central school or schools elects for each such school a prudential com- 
mittee of 3, with a change of 1 each year. Women have the same right as men to hold 
district, town, and county school offices and to vote at school elections. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are sustained by district and town taxation and the income of town 
school funds and of the United States deposit fund. The interest on the last is appor- 
tioned to the towns according to population, while one-half of the town school money, if 
it does not exceed $1,200, or, if it does, one-third of it, is divided equally among the dis-
-P-A-G-E-548

tricts of such towns, the remainder to be divided among the districts according to the 
aggregate attendance of the children of school age during the previous year. Towns fail- 
ing to assess school taxes forfeit to the county a sum equal to double the amount required 
to be raised by such tax, to be recovered in the county«ourt. No public money of any 
town is to be distributed to any school distriet employing a teacher without the certificate 
required by law, nor to any district whose register does not contain the certificate of the 
town superintendent. One or more schools must be maintained in each town for instrue- 
tion in the common school branches, including freehand drawing, history, and Constitu- 
tion of the United States, with special training in the geography, history, and govern- 
ment of Vermont. The school year consists of 2 sessions, each session of 10 consecutive 
weeks. 
Aschool maintained for not less than 30 weeks each year, having 4 or more departments, 
taught by 4 or more teachers, with an established course of study, and under one princi- 
pal, must be graded. A district may provide for high school studies if the number of 
children in it isso great as to require more than one teacher. Contiguous districts may 
form a union school for the benefit of the older children of such districts. A town may 
establish one or more high or central schools for advanced pupilsin the several districts 
in the town and for such non-residents as may be admitted. When the tuition charged 
is not sufficient to pay the expenses, a tax may be assessed on the town to pay the defi- 
ciency. 
Unless otherwise instructed, every child in good health, between 8 and 14 years of age, 
must attend a public school at least 3 months in a year, the employment of such a child 
by a manuiacturer being forbidden, unless the child has attended. school 3 months dur- 
ing the previous year. Parents, guardians, and employers violating this law are liable 
to a fine of from $10 to $20. 
In counties where there is no normal school a graded school legally organized may es- 
tablish a department for the instruction and training of teachers, subject to the control 
of the State superintendent. 
Teachers must have legal certificates of qualification and make required reports to 
district clerks or forfeit the pay they would receive from public school funds. Town 
superintendents must report annually to the State superintendent and he biennially to 
the legislature. The State superintendent is required to hold annual county institutes 
when so requested in writing by 25 teachers in any county, not to exceed a term of 3 
fay and, when not so requested, may act upon his own judgment.— (Revised school 
law. 
fs GENERAL CONDITION. 
According to the census of 1880 the population of Vermont was 332,286; of the 264,052 
persons over 10 years of age enumerated there were 12,993 who could not read and 15,837 
who could not write. The superintendent reports that the school work of the last 2 
years has been largely directed to dissipating this illiteracy by means of improving the 
common schools. As compared with 1881, there was a decrease of 646 in enrolment, of 
1,928 in average daily attendance, of 38 in attendance in private schools, of 20 in school 
districts, 34 in public schools, and of 43 in teachers. The gains were 17 in teachers who 
had attended a Vermont normal school, of 76 cents in the monthly pay of men, and of 
$1.40 in that of women. With this general falling off, there was an increase of $29,226 
in expenditures. 
The great work to be done is the improvement of the district ungraded schools, which 
six-sevenths of the scholars of the State attend, mostof them attending no other. Among 
the causes to which the inefficiency of these schools is attributed are the decrease of native- 
born children, the gathering of the population around business centres, thinly populated 
rural districts, small schools and young scholars, the employment of cheap teachers, who 
are too young and totally ignorant of child nature, the neglect of school-houses and all 
their surroundings, and an indisposition to unite districts and thus secure good schools. 
With some exceptions the superintendent says the work of the ungraded district schools 
of the State is not satisfactory. 
Thirty years ago there were 70 academies’and only 4 graded schools in the State. 
Since then the academies have decreased and the graded schools have increased and 
greatly improved, reporting in 1881 10,404 scholars, while in-the high schools there were

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Burlington reported the general condition of the schools during the year as good. 
Thoroughness characterized instruction and discipline was easily maintained. The en- 
rolment for every term was greater than that for the corresponding term of the preceding 
year, the increase for the winter term being 22; for the spring term, 77; for the fall term, 
55. The report, though giving no statistics of average daily attendance, says that there 
was a slight gain in this and in the number of scholars having no absences. ‘Tardiness 
was reduced 36 per cent. Teachers numbered the same as last year. A special teacher 
of music was employed. Writing and book-keeping are given particular prominence 
in the course of study. Great defects in language were found in the grammar schools, 
and oral lessons were made a part of the instruction in the grammar and intermediate 
grades. The two ungraded day and evening schools were said to be among the most in- 
teresting schools in the city. An important work was done by some of the teachers i in 
arousing an interest among the scholars in good reading. 
Rutland for 1881-’82 reported 22 school districts and 45 common schools, enrolling 
2,585, under 65 teachers, 5 men and 60 women; 15 of the teachers had attended a Ver- 
mont normal school. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
By an act of the general assembly 3 normal schools were established in 1867, at Cas- 
tleton, Johnson, and Randolph, under the general control of the State superintendentand 
a board of trustees for each school. Two courses of study were prescribed for each, the 
first to cover 2 years, the second a year and a half. Each town in the State is entitled 
to a scholarship in any one of the schools, and for those filled the school receives $12 a 
half year. The schools are sustained by appropriations from the State, rents of grammar 
school lands, and tuition fees. State teachers’ certificates, good for 5 years, are issued 
to graduates from the lower course of these schools or graduates from the lower course 
of a training department of a graded school, and for 10 years to those graduating from the 
higher course of either. 
The State Normal School, Castleton, had 4 instructors, 82 normal and 43 other students, 
and 15 graduates, 9 of whom were teaching. Theschool, which was in session 40 weeks, 
had a library of $75 volumes and received from the State $1,936. 
The Johnson State Normal School had 6 instructors, 122 normal students, and 19 gradu- 
ates, all engaged in teaching. It reported a school year of 40 weeks, a library of 6,000 
volumes, and an appropriation from the State of $1,784. 
The Randolph State Normal School reported 6 instructors, 270 normal students, and 43 
graduates, 42 of whom were teaching. Theschool year occupied 40 weeks. Thelibrary 
contained 600 volumes, of which 100 were pedagogical works. 
All the normal schools gave instruction in drawing, but only in the Johnson school was 
freehand drawing taught. Nospecial instruction in either vocal or instrumental music 
was given in any of them. 
TRAINING SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS OF GRADED SCHOOLS. 
In counties where there is no normal school a training school department for the in- 
struction of teachers may be organized in a legal graded school under the general direc- 
tion of the State superintendent, the certificates of graduation having the same power 
as those of normal schools. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
As the law requires, the State superintendent held a teachers’ institute, or teachers’ 
association, in every county in the State. Of these no special mention is made, except 
of those at Chester, Windsor County, and atSt. Johnsbury, Caledonia County, which are 
said to have been of unusual interest; the attendance on the former was 110, and on the 
latter over 100 teachers. Besides these, up to June, 1882, meetings were held in 43 towns,

  256 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
SECONDARY“INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
For these schools no statistics have been reported for 1882. In 1881 there were 34 
high schools, with 1,818 students, of whom 700 studied Latin or Greek or both, 117 
graduated, and 59 fitted for college. 
The superintendent suggests that nine-tenths of these scholars would be better fitted 
for life had they studied science rather than the classics. He considers that, as the 
necessity of understanding science is imposed on the great majority of scholars, it must 
come to the front, the demand of the world to-day being for skilled labor. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
For statistics of business colleges, private academic schools, and preparatory depart- 
ments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, and VII of the appendix, and for summaries of the 
same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, Burlington (non-sectarian), 
gives instruction in the three departments of arts, applied science, and medicine, all the 
courses of the first two being open to young women on the same conditions as to young 
men. The department of arts comprises the usual academic courses in language, mathe- 
matics, physical sciences, mental, moral, and political philosophy, rhetoric, literature, 
andhistory. Applicants for admission to the academical department without examina- 
tion must bring certificates from preparatory schools whose courses of study fully meet the 
requirements of the university and they are on probation during the first term. Val- 
uable additions were made to the museum, library, and chemical laboratory. The 
graduating class of the engineering department aided in the purchase of a plane table 
for the use of this department. All male students are required to take part in military 
drill and instruction 2 hours each week, under an oflicer of the United States Army, 
detailed for that purpose. 
Middlebury Cotlege, Middlebury (Congregational), for young men, confines its instruc- 
tion to an extended classical course of 4years. For admission its requirements are essen- 
tially the same as those of the State University for the same course. It reports a faculty 
of 10, with 38 students: 9 seniors, 11 juniors, 9 sophomores, and 9 freshmen. Of 15,000 
volumesin the college library 1,000 were added during the year. The college has a pro- 
ductive fund of $140,000, yielding an annual income of $8,000, and property valued at 
$150,000. 
Lewis College, Northfield (non-sectarian), was removed from Norwich to. its present 
location in 1866, and was liberally endowed by Colonel Lewis, whose name it bears. The 
college, with its scientific courses noted further on, offers courses in science and literature 
and in arts, the last of which is stated to be a full classical course answering to the usual 
academic course of the American colleges. Candidates for admission to this course must 
be at least 15 years of age, must give proof of good moral character, and must be examined 
in mathematics, English language, geography, history, Latin, and Greek. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
The Vermont Methodist Seminary and Female College, Montpelier, with a faculty of 
10 professors and instructors, is authorized to confer degrees, and, while it admits both 
sexes to equal advantages, appears to be largely for young women. It is not fully col- 
legiate, but has courses such as belong to a good preparatory school. 
For statistics of this class of schools, see Table VIII of the appendix, and for a summary 
of same, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
The State Agricultural College of Vermont, Burlington, a department of the State uni- 
versity, continues to provide instruction in agriculture and related branches of chemis- 
try, in engineering, and in mining, leading to the degrees of PH. B.,C.E.,and M.E. A 
special winter course for young men who cannot leave their farms in summer and au- 
tumn is provided if not less than 10 signify their wish to attend. Among other topics 
treated are stock raising, dairying, fruit culture, road making, farm accounts, and bee 
culture. There was a large increase in this department during the year, the class in 
engineering more than doubling.
-P-A-G-E-551
VERMONT, * 257 
Lewis College requires for admission to its scientific courses of 4 years each an examina- 
tion in mathematics, English, geography, history, and Latin, with French, German, or 
advanced mathematics. 
For further statistics, see Table X of the appendix; for asummary of it, a correspond- 
ing table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. , 
PROFESSIONAL. 
No theological or legal schools report from Vermont. 
The medical department of the University of Vermont, Burlington, reports a faculty of 
10 instructors and lecturers, 1 demonstrator, 5 other instructors connected with the Mary 
Fletcher Hospital, and 8 professors on special subjects. Candidates for graduation must 
be 21 years of age, must have attended 2 full lecture courses such as are recognized by 
the American Medical Association, must have studied medicine 3 years with a regular 
physician or surgeon, must pass a satisfactory examination before the medical faculty 
and a board of examiners appointed by the State Medical Society, and present a thesison 
some medical subject. The Mary Fletcher Hospital, whose grounds adjoin those of the 
university, affords ample opportunities for clinical study. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES. 
Vermont continues to educate its deaf-mutes, blind, and feeble-minded in the institu- 
tions of other States. From October, 1880, to October, 1882, there were 21 deaf-mutes 
inthe American Asylurg at Hartford, Conn., and 4in the Clarke Institution, Northampton, 
Mass., at a cost of $7,120; at the Perkins Institution, Boston, 8 blind: pupils, at a cost 
of $4,850; and at the Massachusetts School for Feeble-Minded Children, South Boston, 
3, at a cost of $2,317. 
REFORMATORY TRAINING. 
The Vermont Reform School, Vergennes, in its biennial report shows 631 inmates since 
opening, 149 boys and 26 girls during the 2 years, 35 of whom were committed and 18 
returned. Of the 89 discharged, 18 were pardoned, 32 furloughed, and 26 placed out. 
In school the ordinary English branches were taught; in industries, housework and sew- 
ing were taught to the girls; seating chairs, shoemaking, and farming to the boys. Of 
the $41,413 expended for the 2 years, the earnings of the boys amounted to $6,535, in 
addition to the income from the farm. An appropriation of $10,000 was expended in 
enlarging the boys’ department. 
EDUCATION OF ORPHAN AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
The only institutions for this purpose in the State are in Burlington and both are sup- 
ported by private contributions: 
The Providence Orphan Asylwm (Roman Catholic) reported 10 instructors, 1,862 in- 
mates since opening, and 46 boys and 52 girls for the year. Children are received from 
2 to 10 years of age and after instruction are placed out in good homes. In school they 
are taught the common school branches, industries, farming, and laundry’and general 
house work. 
The Home for Destitute Children (non-sectarian) shows 14 instructors, 505 inmates since 
the beginning, and 40 boys and 24 girls for the year. Receiving children from infancy 
to 12 years of age, it trains them in the ordinary English branches in school, and in the 
industries of cane seating, laundry, and general housework. By the charter of the in- 
stitution no inmates of either sex are retained beyond the age of 18 and frequently they 
are placed in homes long before. The income of the home was $15,898, in part from 
a permanent fund of $62,000. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-second annual meeting of the Vermont State Teachers’ Association was 
held at Castleton August 9-11, 1862, President J. S. Cilley in the chair. It is said to 
have been a notable occasion. Castleton is at home with educators, having for 96 
years contained one of the prominent educational institutions of the State and for one- 
half of that time a medical college. ‘‘The nobility of work’? was the first paper pre- 
sented. ‘‘ Institutes and institute work” was then fully discussed. This was followed 
by illustrations of practical physics in common schools, showing that teachers with me- 
chanical genius may furnish their own apparatus for illustrating the lever, screw, pul- 
ley, siphon, atmospheric pressure, and for finding the centre of gravity, &c. The sub- 
ject of the best methods of teaching language was then considered, followed by a paper 
showing that since the advent of normal schools illiteracy in the State had decreased,

common schools had advanced under more competent teachers, and pupils were better 
prepared for life. ‘‘Woman’s opportunity’’ then engaged the attention of the association; 
“ Politics in school’? came next and was followed by a discussion of school supervision. 
The closing part of the session was taken up in discussing the State school system. 
President Hamlin, of Middlebury College, said he had searched the statute books for 
a system, but had failed to find one, Mr. Emerson.exposed the defects of the system, 
and Professor Goodrich suggested the advisability of taking a sponge and wiping out 
the semblance of a system, so as to begin anew. Readings and music were among the 
exercises. Officers for the ensuing year were elected and the association adjourned. 
EDUCATIONAL BENEFACTIONS. 
GIFTS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT. 
During the two years 1881 and 1882 the university received the largest individual gifts 
in its history. In 1881 John P. Howard, esq., of Burlington, gave $50,000, in one pay- 
. ment, for the endowment of the chair of natural history, the surplus above the salary 
going to enlarge the cabinets and library. In 1882 John H. Pomeroy left by will $20,000, 
endowing the chair of chemistry, In June, 1882, Hon. J. P. Poland, of St. Johnsbury, 
and John H. Converse, of Philadelphia, each established a scholarship of $1,000 to pay 
the tuition of indigent students. ‘Another gentleman, whose name is withheld, gave 
$1,000 to increase the permanent library fund. Other valuable donations were made to 
the library, the museums, and chemical laboratory. In addition to all his other benefac- 
tions, Mr. Howard has undertaken, at his own expense, the recoastruction of the main 
college building, at an expense of $40,000. 
OBITUARY RECORD. 
HON. GEORGE PERKINS MARSH, LI. D. 
This eminent scholar, author, statesman, and diplomat was born in Woodstock, Vt., 
March 15, 1801. Graduating at Dartmouth College in 1820, he studied law at Burling- 
ton, Vt., and practised. In 1835 he was elected a member of the supreme executive 
council of the State. Having studied comparative philology, he printed privately a 
translation of Rask’s Icelandic Grammar in 1838. He was a member of Congress from 
1842 to 1849, when he was appointed minister resident at Constantinople; went on a 
special mission to Greece in 1852; and travelled extensively in Europe, returning to the 
United States in 1854. He published in 1856 The Camel, His Organization, Habits, 
and Uses, Considered with Reference to His Introduction into the United States; served 
as railroad commissioner in Vermont 1857-1859. He delivered in 1859 a course of lectures 
on the English language (published 1861) at Columbia College, New York, and the win- 
ter of 1860-61 a second course on the same subject before the Lowell Institute at Boston. 
In 1861 he published a largely annotated edition of the first volume of Wedgewood’s 
Etymology and in 1862 The Origin and History of the English Language. He also 
wrote Man and Nature, 1864, which was reissued with important additions in 1874 
with the title The Earth as Modified by Human Action. On the accession of President 
Lincoln in 1861, Mr. Marsh was appointed minister to the new Kingdom of Italy, ‘the 
first minister to the first king.’’? He followed the Italian government from Turin to Flor- 
ence and from Florence to Rome. During the twenty-one years of:his diplomatic service 
at the Italian court, his dispatches to the Department of State cover almost every month. 
They contain a most vivid and trenchant review and narration of contemporary public his- 
tory and personal anecdote, which prove not ouly Mr. Marsh’s conscientious and able 
discharge of duty, but to the future scholar and historian will afford an unequalled store- 
house of facts recorded in a style rarely equalled in such dispatches. In the later dec- 
ade of his service no place could have been found more to his mind or the duties of 
which he could have administered with less fatigue. He was widely known, univer- 
sally respected, and beloved by every one in the official Roman world from th King down. 
“There was no American living who had anything approaching the personal prestige 
with the Italian government that Mr. Marsh enjoyed, and that not for the sake of his 
Government, but for his own.’’ During all those years of active diplomacy, it is said, 
hé never remitted his scholarly research nor the use of his pen. He was constantly 
gathering that valuable library which the munificence of a fellow townsman, Hon. Fred- 
erick Billings, has given to the university of his own State. His mental faculties v 
in clear activity to the end; his physical frame alone grew old. Hedied July 24, 1882,

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The State system of free schools is administered (1) by a superintendent of public in- 
struction elected by the general assembly for 4 years, (2) by a State board of education, 
consisting of the superintendent, the governor, and attorney general, (3) by county sti- 
     
-P-A-G-E-554
    260 REPORT: OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
perintendents appointed by the board for 4 years.and confirmed by the senate, and (4) by 
district school trustees and subdistrict school directors. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The State schools are free to all persons of school age, but the Jaw requires separate 
schools for colored pupils. Persons between the ages of 21 and 25 may be admitted on 
the payment of a tuition fee of $1a month. The schools are supported by a State fund 
made up of the annual interest on a literary fund, a capitation tax not to exceed $1 on 
all voters, and a property tax of not less than 1 nor more than 5 mills on $1, as the gen- 
eral assembly may direct. County and district funds are composed of fines, penalties, and 
donations and a tax not to exceed 10 cents on $100. Telegraph and railroad companies 
are liable toa tax for county and school purposes. Citiesand towns may levy for thesupport 
of public free schools a tax not to exceed 3 mills on $1 and a capitation tax not to exceed 
50 cents for all school purposes. A school census is taken every 5 years, and the State 
funds are apportioned among the counties and cities by the State superintendent on the 
basis of the number of children of school age shown by this census. School districts, to 
receive State funds, must provide school-houses, furniture, &c., and show that the schools 
have been taught 5 months during the year. The common English branches must be 
taught in every public school, but any district may admit instruction in any branches 
which qualify pupils for teaching or for college, on the payment of a fee not exceeding 
$2.50 a month for each pupil. County superintendents are required to hold at least one 
teachers’ institute in their respective counties each scholastic year. Teachers are 
expected to attend these institutes and are not to lose their pay should the time so 
occupied cover any part of the school term. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The State school census being taken only once in 5 years, that of 1880 is used for 
children of school age, but the enrolment and attendance have increased very largely. 
There were 17 more graded schools, and although fewer school-houses had been built 
than in 1881 8 more were owned by the districts and the value of school property in- 
creased $147,324. The superintendent of public instruction reports progress in nearly 
every item, but calls attention to the fact that 438 colored schools were taught by white 
teachers; he says these schools should be taught by competent colored teachers and that 
many more schools should be opened to accommodate the colored children. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
‘The State received $1,000 in 1882 from this source, with the stipulation that it should 
be used to defray the expenses of teachers’ institutes. 
KINDERGARTEN, 
Two schools of this class report for 1882: the American Kindergarten, Richmond, and 
Portsmouth Kindergarten, Portsmouth. The statistics of these schools will be found in 
Table V of the appendix. 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF CITIES WITH 7,500 OR MORE INHABITANTS. 
OFFICERS. 
All cities of 10,000 inhabitants must and all others may have a city superintendent 
of schools, appointed by the State board of education and confirmed by the senate. The 
school affairs of such cities are managed by a board of not more than 3 trustees from 
each ward.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The normal schools reporting for 1881 are the Virginia Normal School, Bridgewater, 
organized in 1873; Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, organized in 1868; St. 
Stephen’s Normal School, Petersburg, organized in 1871; Virginia Normal and Collegiate 
Institute, Petersburg, established in March, 1882, and Richmond Normal School, organ- 
ized in 1867. The first named offered a 2-year course of normal training; Hampton, for 
colored and Indian youth, reported a 3-year normal course, 442 students, and 60 graduates, 
of whom 47 engaged in teaching; St. Stephen’s, for colored youth, under control of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church, offered a 3-year normal course, with 20 students, of whom 
10 were graduated; and the Virginia Institute offered a 3-year normal course, but furnishes 
no statistics. The legislature appropriated to this much needed institution $100,000 for 
the erection of suitable buildings and $10,000 annually for its support. The city appro- 
priated $1,400 in 1882 for the Richmond Normal School, which is a part of the public 
school system of that city. There were 49 (colored) students, with9 graduates, 8 of whom. 
engaged in teaching. 
GENERAL TEACHERS’ INSTITUTE. 
While the laws of Virginia forbid the use of public money for institute purposes, the 
agent of the Peabody fund required that the $1,000 given to the State in 1882 from that 
fund should be devoted to institutes: Three normal institutes were held, at Salem, 
Farmville, and Petersburg, in August, 1882. The first two of these continued 10 days, 
the last two weeks, with a total attendance of 307 teachers. Lectures were delivered 
and instruction was given in the common English branches. Towards the close of the 
Petersburg institute the Virginia Teachers’ Association was formed, having for its object 
a closer union of teachers, and it is believed that if this is fostered great good will result. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
Of the counties reporting, 44 held no institute, while 67 held 1 or more, Essex report- 
ing 17, Lynchburg 11, and Alexandria 10. The attendance of teachers was reported 
good in nearly all the institutes.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN.    
The University of Virginia, Albemarle County (non-sectarian), offers free instruction 
to residents of the State and 14 scholarships, good for one year, to successful candidates 
from any State at a competitive examination, 3 of these being added by the visitors in 
1882. Thorough instruction was given in all the chief branches of learning. The courses 
of instruction are academical and professional: the former are in 2 departments, literary 
and scientific; the latter, in the 4 departments of medicine, law, engineering, and agri- 
culture. In the several departments there are 19 distinct schools, from which students 
may elect their course of study. For 1882 there were reported 326 undergraduates and 
24 instructors. 
Of the 6 other institutions of this class reporting for 1882, Randolph Macon College, 
Ashland (Methodist Episcopal), Washington and Lee University, Lexington (non- 
sectarian), and Richmond College, Richmond (Baptist), arranged their courses of study 
in separate schools. Emory and Henry College, Emory (Methodist Episcopal), Hamp- 
den Sidney College, Hampden Sidney (Presbyterian), and Roanoke College, Salem 
(Lutheran), all reported preparatory departments and 4-year classical courses. Rich- 
mond reported gifts to the amount of $30,000 in 1882, from friends in Virginia, Georgia, 
and Northern States, for building purposes. Roanoke noted the sum of $4,000 from 
Northern States for current expenses.

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Scientific instruction was offered in 3 of the regular colleges reporting for 1882: Emory 
and Henry College, Washington and Lee University, and the University of Virginia. 
The first had a 3-year course and a 4-year Latin scientific course; the 2 universities, 
courses in civil engineering and general nce, the last named adding schools of agri- 
culture, zodlogy, and botany of 2 to 3 years, with an experimental farm for practical in- 
struction. 
The special scientific schools reporting for the year are (1) the Virginia Agricultural 
and Mechanical College, Blacksburg, organized in 1872, free to resident students, with 
1 year of preparatory study and a 3-year scientific course leading to the degrees of 
graduate in agriculture, graduate in mechanics, and bachelor of arts; (2) Hampton Nor- 
mal and Agricultural Institute, organized in 1868, for colored students, since opencd 
to Indians also, offering a 4-year course, including elementary studies, agriculture, and 
engineering; and (3) the Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, founded in 1889, which 
receives $15,000 annually from the State for the benefit of cadets who are unable to pay

STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of free schools, elected by the people for 4 years, has seneral 
control of public school interests; a board of the school fund, composed of the gov- 
ernor, State superintendent, auditor, and treasurer, manages, controls, and invests the 
public school funds; a board of regents of the State Normal School, comprising the
-P-A-G-E-559
    WEST VIRGINIA, 265 
State superintendent and one person from each congressional district of the State, ap- 
pointed by the governor, has the government and control of the normal school and its 
branches; and a board of regents of the West Virginia University, consisting of one person 
from each senatorial district, manages the affairs of that institution. 
Local school interests are supervised by county school superintendents elected by the 
people for 2 years, by district boards of education, and by subdistrict boards of trustees. 
A county board of examiners for eachicounty, to examine and license teachers, is com- 
posed of the county superintendent, who is ex officio president, and 2 experienced teach- 
ers, the latter nominated by the county superintendent and appointed, for terms of one 
year, by the presidents of district boards. District boards comprise a president and two 
commissioners elected by the people for terms of 4 years, with provision for a change of 
one commissioner every two years. The district board appoints 3 trustees for each sub- 
district, who hold office for 3 years, 1 going out each year. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
Public sthools are sustained from the proceeds of a State school fund and from district 
taxation. The State fund is derived from the sale of United States land warrants, an 
annual tax of 10 cents on the $100, a capitation tax of $1, fines, forfeitures, &c., and the in- 
come of such bank stock and United States bonds as may be held by the State. Districts 
are required'to raise a tax sufficient to provide schools at least 4 months in the year, but 
the amount so levied must not exceed 50 cents on $100; and any districts failing to raise 
the required tax may not receive their share of the State school fund. The latteris dis- 
tributed on the basis of the number of youth of school age in the State according to the 
latest enumeration, the salary of the State superintendent and other expenses of the 
office being first deducted from the amount. Teachers to be employed in public schools 
must have a certificate from the proper authorities. These certificates are of 3 grades, 
determined by the percentage attained on examination. Teachers must keep a daily 
ister and makemonthly and term reports to the district board, failing in which they 
forfeit the balance of pay due them. White and colored children are not allowed to attend 
the same school, but the law requires the establishment of a school for colored children in 
every district containing 15 or more colored persons 6 to 21 yearsold. Provision is made 
in the system for graded and high schools, teachers’ institutes, a State normal school and 
branches, and a State university. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics show an increase in the number of youth of school age, in public school 
enrolment and average attendance, in the number of schools taught and the amount of 
money expended for them, in the value of public school property, and in the amount of 
the public school fund. The latter had materially increased during the years 1881 and 
1882; and the amount of public funds for distribution to the counties arising from the 
interest on the invested funds, State school tax, and other sources was greater this year 
than ever before. +The average ‘school term throughout the State was one day longer thanin 
1881 and 10 more school-houses were builtduringthe year. Thepercentage of enrolment 
and average attendance based on the enumeration increased during the year, although 
that of average attendance on enrolment fell off slightly. The latter fact is accounted 
- for partly by the unusually wet winter, which made the numerous streams dangerous 
for the children to cross, causing also more than the average amount of sickness. Super- 
intendent Butcher says the general approval and generous aid given educational work 
by members of all professions and callings have been very gratifying. Newspapers and 
physicians are especially mentioned, the latter for instruction given to teachers in school 
hygiene and other subjects. A large number of newspapers gave the teachers a column 
each week, to be edited by the county superintendent or some of the teachers; others gave 
generously of their space for all educational news. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
Assistance to the amount of $2,300 was afforded the public school interests from the 
Peabody fund, The Educational Journal receiving $200, normal schools $1,100, and 
teachers’ institutes $1,000.— (Report of trustees. )

266 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
average attendance on public schools, under 92 teachers; about 1,000 attended private 
and parochial schools; 8 public school buildings furnished accommodations for 5,550 chil- 
dren. School property was valued at $240,680 and $90,025 were expended during the 
year for public school purposes. 
Additional particulars.—The year was one of advance inall departments of school work, 
bringing a better and higher public sentiment regarding the publieschools. These were 
classed as primary, grammar, and high, the latter comprising 490 sittings for study and 
giving employment to 22teachers. A fine school building was completed during the 
year. It was finished throughout in good style, well heated and ventilated, and cost 
nearly $40,000. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The regents of the State Normal School report for 1881-’82, in the State Normal at 
Mershall College, Huntington, and its branches at Fairmount, Concord, West Liberty, 
Shepherdstown, and Glenville, a total enrolment of 617 pupils, of whom 37 were gradu- 
ated, the average actual monthly enrolment of normal pupils being 321. State appoint- 
ments to the normal schools for white pupils may be given to 600 persons, divided among 
the counties according to population. The miximum age for admission is fixed at-13 for 
girls and 14 for boys. It is the practice to allow persons attending under appointment 
to teach one term of school each year if they desire to do so. 
Storer College, for colored students, enrolled, 230 pupils in normal aud other depart- 
ments, 18 of them being State students. For the tuition of the latter, room rent, and 
books, $630 were appropriated by the State, in accordance with a law passed by the 
legislature in 1881, which provides that if possible there shall be each year arrange- 
ments made with some suitable institution of learning in the State for the training of 
colored school teachers, the number to be aided bearing the same proportion to the col- 
ored population that the number of white State students bears to the white population. 
OTHER PROVISION FOR NORMAL TRAINING., 
The State is entitled to 6 scholarships in the State Normal College, awarded by the 
trustees of the Peabody fund. Three of these had been filled at the date of the super- 
intendent’s report by appointment through him after a competitive examination of the 
applicants. 
A normel course of 3 years is furnished in West Virginia‘ College, Flemington, special 
attention being given in the first two years to the branches taught in the public schools, 
the third year to collegiate branches. 
  TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The institutes held during the year were well attended and well taught, and, it is 
thought, contributed materially to the general improvement going forward in the schools. 
There were 58 county institutes and 7 district Peabody institutes held (one of the latter 
being for colored teachers), with a total attendance of 4,699, the average attendance at 
all being 3,269. The whole expense for county institutes was $1,275; for district insti- 
tutes, $625. 
WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL JOURNAL, 
This journal, published at Concord, Mercer County (in its’second volume in 1882), 
has been found by the State superintendent to be of great, service to the educational 
department. Official papers and announcements appear in it, as well as current infor- 
mation in regard to school affairs and many articles useful to teachers. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOCLY, 
Free high schools, according to law, may be established in districts where they are 
considered nec , and 10 such were reported ia 1882 by the State superintendent, 
but without siatistics, except as to the number of pupils studying different branches. 
These were: In algebra, 1,429; geometry, 136; nhilosophy, 348; physiology, 259; physi- 
213; rhetoric, 91; book-keeping, '74; botany, 301; and German, 303.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN AND FOR BOTH SEXES. 
West Virginia University, Morgantown (non-sectarian), heretofore comprising classi- 
cal, scientific, engineering, and military courses of study, each of 4 years, reports a change 
made in the arrangement of the studies in 1882 by the board of managers, who, acting 
upon the unanimous request of the faculty, abolished the curriculum and distributed the 
course into 10 independent schools, of which 8 are academic and 2 professional. Still 
the course of study has the same general scope as formerly: the degrees conferred con- 
tinue to be bachelor of science, bachelor of arts, and bachelor of laws. The change was 
expected to secure greater freedom in the selection of studies and to result in an eleva- 
tion of the standard of instruction and attainment. The academic schools as organized 
are: (1) metaphysics; (2) mathematics; (3) ancient languages; (4) modern languages; (5) 
English; (6) geology; (7) history; and (8) agriculture, chemistry, andphysics. The pro- 
fessional schools are: (1) law and equity and (2) anatomy, physiology, and hygiene. 
There were 112 students enrolled during the year, all men. 
Bethany College, Bethany (Christian), open to both sexes, presents 3 separate complete 
courses, the classical, the scientific, and the ministerial, leading respectively to the de- 
grees of bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, and bachelor of letters, besides 3 special 
courses in engineering, physics, and chemistry, for which certificates only are given, and 
a thorough academic course of 2 years, which is preparatory to the regular collegiate. 
There is a special arrangement of studies for young women who prefer French and Ger- 
man to Greek, but all courses are open to them. 
West Virginia College, Flemington (Free Will Baptist), also open to both sexes, offers in 
. its collegiate department 3 courses, classical, philosophical, and literary, leading to the 
degrees of A. B., PH. B., and LIT. B. and requiring only 3 years for completion; also, 
select or partial courses for such as are not candidates for a degree, There is also a con- 
servatory of music, with a 3-year course in piano and vocal music; a military depart- 
ment, affording to the young men physical training and a knowledge of militgpy science; 
and a normal department, with a 3-year course of study. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF YOUNG WOMEN. 
Broaddus Female College, Clarksburg (Baptist), Parkersburg Seminary for Girls, Park- 
ersburg (non-sectarian), and Wheeling Female College, Wheeling (non-sectarian), all 
authorized to confer collegiate degrees, report over 150 pupils in collegiate classes dur-

SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
  The State university continues, as before the change in the arrangement of its curric- 
ulum, to provide facilities for scientific study, the scientific degree conferred being that 
of B. Ss. To obtain this, students must have graduated in the schools of metaphysics, 
modern languages, English, geology and natural history, agriculture, chemistry and 
physics, and mathematics. 
Bethany College presents a scientific course of 4 years, leading to the degree of bachelor 
of science, and a special course in engineering, for which no specified time is required. 
The branches included in the special course are land surveying, topographical surveying 
and drawing, Yevelling, profiling, mapping, descriptive geometry (with shades, shadows, 
and perspective), and road and railroad surveying. 
For statistics, see Table X of the appendix, and for asummary, see a corresponding table 
in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
PROFESSIONAL. 
Theological instruction’is given in a 4-year ministerial course in Bethany College 
(Christian). The course comprises sacred literature, Greek, Latin, mathematics and 
astronomy, natural science, mental and political philosophy, belles lettres, sacred history, 
and moral philosophy. 
Legal instruction is given in West Virginia University in a 2-year course of study, em- 
bracing common, statute, mercantile, constitutional, and international law, and equity. 
Twelve students were enrolled during 1882 and 2 were graduated. 
There is no full medical course reported; but the school of anatomy, physiology, and 
hygiene of West Virginia University aims to teach anatomy thoroughly and practically, 
providing subjects for dissection, and physiology and hygiene also practically by speci- 
mens, drawings, lectures, the use of the microscope, and other means,

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND. 
The West Virginia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Romney, estab- 
lished in 1870, reports for 1882 an appropriation from the State of $27,000 and grounds 
and buildings valued at $80,000. There were 98 pupils under instruction, of whom 66 
were deaf and dumb and 32 blind. 
The deaf and dumb are taught the English language, arithmetic, geography, history, 
grammar, and drawing; also, the employments of printing, tailoring, shoemaking, car- 
pentry, and cabinet making. Articulation has been taught, but the results were not 
practical and it was discontinued. 
The blind are instructed in the common school branches, higher mathematics, and 
music, besides mattress and broom making and chair caning. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. 
WEST VIRGINIA EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The State Association met at Kingwood July 11, 1882, and was called to order by State 
Superintendent B. L. Butcher. The first subject before the meeting was ‘‘ What they 
do in the rural district schools.’’ It was discussed by several members, after which the 
association listened to an address delivered by Hon. C. J. Faulkner, on ‘‘ Education.” 
“* Teachers’ salaries ’’ was the next topic under discussion, in the course of which it was 
argued that good work cannot generally be expected of poorly paid teachers. In the even- 
ing an address of welcome was delivered by Joseph H. Hawthorn, county superintendent 
of Preston County, to which Mr. T. C. Miller, superintendent of the Fairmount graded 
schools, responded. The remaining papersread and discussed were ‘‘ Mental discipline vs. 
knowledge,’’ ‘‘ Professional training in normal schools,’’ ‘‘ Local history,” and ‘‘ School 
hygiene,”’the last by Dr. James EY Reeves, of Wheeling, and ‘‘ Free text books for 
free schoo¥s.”” W. L. Wilson, president of West Virginia University, gave a talk on 
the future of that institution, its possibilities, and the place it should occupy in the 
educational system of the State. After the adoption of resolutions and the election of 
officers for the ensuing year, the association adjourned, to meet in 1883 at Buckhannon.

270 REPORT OF ‘THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A State superintendent of public instruction is chosen biennially by the people; there 
are also county superintendents. Counties with more than 15,000 inhabitantsmay have 
two superintendents, and two counties appear to have availed themselves of this pro- 
vision. Ordinary school districts (which must not include more than 36 square miles) 
elect, at the first annual meeting of their resident voters, a district school board of 3 
members, and each year afterwards one member in place of an outgoing one. Town- 
ship districts that by popular vote have abolished the district system have boards composed 
of the clerks of the former school districts, now made subdistricts, such clerks to be 
chosen by vote of the people of each subdistrict at their annual meetings. These boards 
elect from their own number a president and vice president, who, with a secretary elected 
at the same meeting (not necessarily from their own number), constitute an executive 
school committee, the secretary acting as supervisor of the schools. Free high schools 
have also boards of 3 members, except in cities not under county superintendents, where 
the city board acts as the high school board. Women are allowed to hold school offices 
below the State superintendency. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The schools of the State are free to all the persons residing in the district who are 
between 4 and 20 years of age. Persons under or over this age may attend by consent of 
school boards, and children 6 to 15 yearsof age must, unless excused. The number of chil- 
dren 4to20in each district is ascertained by an annual census taken by the district clerk, 
who must also report the number taughtin the districtschool or schools during the preced- 
ing school year, the number over or under the school age that have been so taught, the 
time covered by such teaching, the names and wages of the teachers, the text books 
used, the moneys received and expended for school purposes, and such other facts and 
statistics as the State superintendent may require. The income of a considerable State 
school fund is distributed annually only to such towns and districts as send in through 
their clerks these required reports and show that they have raised towards the support 
of common schools at least half the amount last apportioned to them from the State fund, 
besides maintaining schools at least 3 months, and 5 months, if possible. If State funds 
be thus lost by any town or district through failure of the clerks to make report, the 
offending clerks are liable to suit for the recovery of the whole amount so lost. The 
teachers of all schools thus assisted by the State must have certificates of qualification 
for their work and must keep a daily register to show that work. To aid in acquiring the 
proper qualifications, there are county teachers’ institutes, free high schools, 4State normal 
schools, and a State university. 
GENERAL CONDITION, 
The summaries of items in the State school work, given with great fulness in the 
State report for 1881, have been so reduced in the report for 1882 that a fair comparison 
of the two years is rendered difficult. From the figures given, however, it appears that 
there was progress on the whole. The increase in enrolment in the State free schools 
was more than five times as great as the increase of the year before, but the average 
daily attendance is not given for 1882. The 4 State normal schools increased their at- 
tendance by 23 students, but in private and church schools and in collegiate and theo- 
logical seminaries the figures given indicate a falling off of 6,033, so that the whole 
number under instruction for the year appears to have been considerably less than in 
1880-’81. At other points the record is more favorable. Ungraded schools diminished; 
graded ones considerably increased. The whole number ef State tree schools was 50 
greater, with 54 more houses for them, the valuation of State school property being 
$47,305 higher ; and private and church schools fell off 45. ‘Teachers in State schools were 
not only more numerous (in some cases, it is true, from changes within the year), but 
they also upon the whole got better pay- 
CHANGES IN THE SCHOOL LAW. 
The only changes noted were (1) a requirement that the annual census of children of 
school age should be taken ou the last day of May, instead of the last day of August; 
(2) that the annual meetings of school districts, formerly in July for those with graded 
schools and in September for all others, should be in all districts on the first Monday in 
June; (8) that high schools affording true high school training and having not less than 
25 pupils should have the time for State aid extended from 5 to 10 years—all evident 
improvements,

ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
All the cities named above had in 1881~’82, as previously, graded courses of instruc- 
tion, covering usually 10 to 12 yearsand including high school studies. In most of them 
pupils are enabled to fit themselves for college. 
Appleton reports 7 school buildings, with sittings for 2,000 pupils, containing 30 rooms 
for school use, all of which were supplied with blackboards, 8 with reading charts, 6 
with globes, &c. The cash value of school apparatus was $1,200, or $400 more than 
last year, but that of sites and buildings was reported less than in 1880-’81. Teachers’ 
meetings, last reported as held semimonthly, were held weekly in 1882. Instead of 
the 4 private schools of 1881 there were 3, with the same number of teachers, but with 
36 fewer pupils. 
Fond du Lae reports its 19 school buildings all in good condition, with sittings for 3,800 
pupiJs (1,000 more than in 1881), and its school rooms fewer, but all supplied with black- 
boards and dictionaries. There is no note of the 12 private schools reported the preced- 
ing'year. Teachers met for consultation semimonthly. A school library of 282 volumes 
is reported. 
Green Bayhad 5 school buildings, as before, with 1,000 sittings, accommodating imper- 
fectly 3 primary grades, 3 intermediate, 3 grammar, and 4 high. The valuation of its 
best school-house and site was $25,000; that of the 5, with apparatus, $51,900. There 
were 6 private schools, with 11 teachers and 509 scholars. 
Janesville held its 6 graded schools in as many school-houses, with seats for a few more 
pupils; its 32 or 33 school rooms were all supplied with needful apparatus; value of school 
property, $67,150. The teachers held meetings twice a month. Three private schools had 
265 pupils, under 7 teachers. : 
La Crosse reported 11 buildings for its public schools (one more than in 1881, with 66 
more sittings), its 34 school rooms supplied with blackboards and illustrative apparatus, 
valued, with sites, buildings, and furniture, including a library of 210 volumes, at 
$104,330. The teachers met semimonthly. There is no note of the evening school re- 
ported in 1881 nor of any private schools. 
Madison continued to report 9 school-houses, but rated their seating capacity 264 higher. 
All were said to be in good condition and well ventilated, with necessary conveniences, 
their 27 rooms being supplied with school apparatus worth $1,500. The valuation of its 
best school-house and site was $27,000; that of all, not including furniture or apparatus, 
$100,000. The schools all had 4 or more departments, and 2 Kindergiirten were reported, 
with 2 teachers and 65 children, whether connected with the city system or not does not 
clearly appear. The city teachers held meetings once a week. Hight private schoolg 
had 180 days of session, under i6 teachers, but the attendance in them is not given.

  272 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Milwaukee, with 26 public school buildings, as before, had rebuilt one, and valued its 
best, withsite, at $52,000; it valued all, with sites, furniture, and apparatus, at $705,033 
Night schools were held in 47 rooms, under as many teachers. A city normal schovl, 
with 2 teachers, had 14 pupils, all in daily attendance for the year. This was soon 
to be superseded by a State normal school in the city, for which the legislature had 
made provision. German, as well as music and drawing, entered into the courses of the 
public schools, all being taught by special teachers. The rooms for city schools num- 
bered 233, well furnished with school apparatus and appliances for aid in study. Two 
Kindergiirten are reported, with 2 teachers and 227 pupils; also, 53 private or church 
schools, under 216 teachers, with 7,579 scholars. 
Oshkosh reports 9 school buildings, with 59 rooms, one building less than in 1881; the 
rooms the same in number, but with an estimated seating capacity 500 less; its school 
apparatus about the same as last year and rated at the same sum, $2,500. The entire 
school property was estimated as worth $146,500. : E : 
Racine shows 9 school-houses, with 48 occupied rooms and 2,/700 sittings, an increase 
of lin buildings, of 3in rooms, and of 150 in seats for pupils. Five other rooms were used. 
for recitations only. The rooms appear to have been well supplied with apparatus, val- 
ued at $750, besides a library of 1,580 volumes, rated at $500. A'return gives $107,000 
as the valuation of all school property. The meetings of its teachers were semimonthly. 
In 9 private or church schools, under 27 teachers, there were 1,061 pupils. 
Sheboygan had 6 buildings, with 1,050 seats, asin 1881, and set the same valuation onits 
school property. Its schools were regularly graded and its 19 rooms allsupplied with 
blackboards and other aids to teaching. The teachers held monthly meetings. Four 
private schools, under 12 teachers, had an enrolment of 490 pupils; a Kindergarten had 
27 pupils. } 
Watertown had 5 school buildings, with 1,200 sittings, as before reported. Its night 
school was continued, with 2 more pupils. There was also a Kindergarten, with 25. The 
apparatus of the 22 city school rooms was rated at $1,500, other school property, includ- 
ing a library of 750 volumes, being estimated at $35,150, not including furniture. 
Teachers’ meetings were held semimonthly. In 4 private schools there were 650 pupils, 
under 10 teachers. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Four seminaries, under a State board of regents of normal schools, have for some 
years been the agents especially authorized to train young men and women in scien- 
tific methods of instruction: one at Platteville, organized in 1866; one at Whitewater, 
in 1868; one at Oshkosh, in 1871; and one at River Falls, in 1875. All have ele- 
mentary and advanced normal courses, the 2 together covering 4 years; preparatory 
instruction for imperfectly trained candidates for admission is likewise provided. All 
have also primary, intermediate, and grammar departments of regular public schools, 
which serve as practice schools for the normal classes and to some extent as lower means 
of preparation for them." The Oshkosh school has also a Kindergarten department for 
the initiation of its students into that method of instruction. The number of students 
in the normal departments of these schools in 1881-’82 was 948; in the preparatory, 
not including the practice schools, 233; in the practice schools, with the Kindergarten, 
755. Deducting names counted twice, the whole number was 1,921. Of these, 61 
completed the elementary and 31 the advanced course. Superintendent Graham says 
that 334 graduates of these normal schools and 1,097 that had studied in them without 
uating served as teachers in the State schools in 1881-’82. This was almost one- 
fifth of the whole number required to teach the schools, and, as the proportion of such 
trained teachers thus employed increases gradually each year, the average quality of 
the State school instruction must be steadily improved through their influence. Under 
the law of 1880, another school of this class is about to be established at Milwaukee, 
with probably greater attendance and at least equally good instruction, so that the ben- 
eficial influence of these State agencies for training will be considerably increased. The 
instruction given in them for the year is highly commended by the regents. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
The City Normal School of Milwaukee, established in 1872 to prepare trained teachers for 
the city schools, continued its good work in 1881-82, with 14 pupils, under 2 instructors. 
pepenre said, it is soon to be superseded by a new State normal school to be established 
in the city. 
The National German-American Teachers’ Seminary, Milwaukee, reports 44 normal stu- 
dents and 5 graduates, its course of study comprising 3 years. 
The Catholic Normal Schoolsof the Holy Family, St. Francis Station, also reports a 3-year 
normal course of study, .35,students, and 6 graduates,
-P-A-G-E-567
  WISCONSIN. 273 
Milton and Beloit Colleges and Lawrence and Galesville Universities provide instruc- 
tion for students intending to teach, the first named preparing for work in high as well 
as district schools. ¢ 
INSTITUTES FOR TEACHERS. 
Of these temporary normal schools, maintained under State authority and largely with 
funds provided by the State, 14 were held in the spring and 42 in the summer and fall 
of 1882, after a special meeting of the conductors appointed and full arrangement of the 
course of.instruction to be given. This instruction, part of agraded course, was largely 
devoted to the grammar grade of school work, its connection with that of 2 preceding 
years being kept up by a review of the subjects treated in those years. These institutes 
were held in 54 counties and superintendent districts and were in session 87 weeks, un- 
der 4 regular and 27 assistant conductors. With or without aid from the State most of 
the other counties or superintendent districts had their regular annual institutes, and 2 
held 2 institutes each. In all the institutes 694 males and 2,879 females were enrolled, 
making a total of 3,573 instructed more or less in normal methods and in the science of 
teaching. 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL. 
The Wisconsin Journal of Education, conducted by the State superintendent and his 
assistant at Madison, continued in 1881-’82 its monthly information and discussions re- 
specting current school work. The best of the papers presented at the annual meetings 
of the State Teachers’ Association usually get into its pages, and thus many useful sug- 
gestions as to discipline, instruction, &c., are disseminated among teachers and school 
boards, as the law allows each school district clerk and each town clerk or secretary of 
a town board of directors:to,subscribe for the paper out of the school money. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Since 1875 the formation of schools of this class has been encouraged by an offer of 
State aid to such as should be organized, with not less than 25 pupils prepared to enter 
on a high school course, in connection with the schools of the State system. The aidto 
be given was limited to $25,000 annually, which was to be divided among the schoolsin 
proportion to the amount expended by each for instruction in high school studies. In 
consideration of this aid each principal of a participating school appointed after the en- 
actment of the law was to be a graduate of'a university, college, or normal school or 
was to pass an examination in the studies to be pursued. The State aid given was lim- 
ited at first to 3 years, then to 5, butin 1882 was lengthened to another 5. The number 
of schools aided has been as follows: In 1876, 20; 1877, 59; 1878, 85; 1879, 88; 1880, 
91; 1881, 78; 1882, 98. This last number does not include 6 that were known to exist, 
but did not report in time to receive their apportionment. The diminution in 1881 is 
attributed to the fact that the 5-year limit of State aid had been reached by such as 
had received it at the beginning and that some of them, not knowing of the extension 
of thetime, did not send in their reports. 
Of 6,528 pupils enrolled in these schools in 1881-82, only 367 completed either of the 
2 courses of study (English and classical) that had beenearranged for them, and only 
2,418 had completed such a course in the 7 years since the plan of State aid was inaugu- 
rated. Thegreat majority are said to take the easier English course, comparatively few 
including in it certain optional German studies. Still, the State superintendent ex- 
presses a firm belief that these schools have done and are doing an important work, both 
in supplementing the ordinary common school instruction and in indirectly preparing 
teachers for the common schools. In this last direction he thinks they can be utilized 
still further, and makes suggestions which, if carried out, will be likely to add much to 
their efficiency. 
Of high schools not aided by the State there is a list of 23 in the tables of the State 
report. These had a registration of 1,574, so that, adding 6,528 in the aided schools, at 
Jeast 8,102 were under high school training in 1881-82. Both sexes were admitted to 
the schools of each. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Only 13 academies and 2 business colleges are reported by the State superintendent 
in 1882, against 17 of the former and 7 of the latter reported the year before. 
For further statistics of business colleges, academic and preparatory schools, and pre- 
paratory departments of colleges or universities, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the 
appendix, further on, and for summaries of such statistics, corresponding tables in the 
teport of the Commissioner preceding.

SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
Eight institutions classed by this Office as colleges and universities, all but 2 being open 
to both sexes, send reports for 1882, their names and locations being as follows: Lawrence 
- University, Appleton; Beloit College, Beloit; Galesville University, Galesville; Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin, Madison; Milton College, Milton; Racine College, Racine; Ripon 
College, Ripon; and Northwestern University, Watertown. All except the State Uni- 
versity provide preparatory departments; all have classical courses of 4 years and all 
scientific courses of 4 years, except Beloit, which presents, instead, a course leading to 
the degree of PH. B., but still gives special attention to the natural sciences and the 
modern languages. German forms a part of the course, either required or optional, in 
all but 1, and French in all but 2; Northwestern University makes Hebrew as well as 
French an optional; and in the State university special provision is made for the study 
of Scandinavian languages, which are also taught in Milton College. Four colleges make 
some provision for the preparation of teachers, 3 for “business, and 3 for instruction in 
musical and artistic branches.— (Catalogues. ) 
Three colleges report gifts received during the year amounting to $32,078. Beloit re- 
ceived $25,000, of which $13,000 were for an observatory, $2,000 for scholarships, and 
$10,000 for general purposes. Lawrence University had $3,774 from various friends to 
meet current expenses, and Milton College, $3,304 for endowment. 
The State university, with grounds, buildings, and apparatus valued at $1,400,000 
and productive funds amounting to $493,790, receives also an annual appropriation from 
the State and gives tuition free to students residing in the State. In accordance with 
the law of its organization the university comprises a college of arts and one of letters. 
Of the professional colleges contemplated only that of law has been established. The 
college of arts includes a course in general science and special technical departments of 
agriculture and civil, mining, metallurgical, and mechanical engineering. The college 
of letters comprises an ancient and a modern classical course: Provision is also made 
for special students who are not candidates for a degree. They are allowed to take up 
any study they may be qualified to pursue, but, on admission, must first pass such an ex- 
amination in the English branches as is required for admission to the freshman class of 
the general scientific course. Bachelors of arts, letters, and science may continue their 
studies at the university under direction of the faculty and take appropriate degrees. 
The board of regents report for the year satisfactory progress made in all departments, 
but urge that the funds are becoming insufficient for the growing wants of the institu- 
tion. The most marked external event in its history during the year was the renova- 
tion of University Hall, which was satisfactorily accomplished at an expense of $15,000, 
the sum granted by the legislature for that purpose. There were 314 students under 
instruction during 1882 in all departments of the university, 207 of them in regular col- 
legiate classes, of which latter number 49 were women. 
For further statistics of colleges and universities reporting, see Table IX of the appen- 
dix, and for a summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
In the State superintendent’s report a table is given embracing statistics from 13 in- 
stitutions classed by him as collegiate, including the 8 given above except Galesville Uni- 
versity. Six of the 13 are, however, classed by this Office among other than collegiate 
institutions. The whole enrolment reported to the superintendent was 2,141, of whom 
894 were women; 45 of the whole number were candidates for the degree of A. B. and 
42 for thatofB.s. The value of college buildings (11 reporting this item) was $664,350; 
that of sites (10 reporting), $127,000. In the college libraries (12 reporting) there were 
49,766 volumes, and in society libraries (7 reporting), 7,976. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
Wisconsin Female College, Fox Lake (including also an academy for young men), 
Milwaukee College, Milwaukee, and the Academy of Santa Clara, Sinsinawa Mound, 
report 91 students in regular collegiate classes, the whole enrolment being 487. Kem- 
per Hall, Kenosha, sends no report for 1882. For further statistics, see Table VIII of the 
appendix, and for a summary, a corresponding table in the report of the Commissioner 
preceding. 
SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
SCIENTIFIC. 
Provisions more or less thorough for scientific study are made in all the universities 
and colleges included in Table IX, all but Beloit College, as already stated, presenting 
courses of 4 years in general science leading to the degree of B. s., and the State univer- 
sity, in addition to this general course, offering 4 technical courses in agriculture, civi]

engineering, mining and metallurgical engineering, and mechanical engineering, each of 
these requiring 4 years for its completion and leading to the corresponding bachelor’s 
degree. The degrees of civil engincer, metallurgical engineer, mining engineer, and 
mechanical engineer are conferred on examination after a year of additional study and prac- 
tice at the university or elsewhere. There were 95 undergraduate students in general 
and technical scientific studies at the opening of the fall term of 1882. 
PROFESSIONAL, 
Three theological schools, viz, Luther Seminary, Madison (Evangelical Lutheran), Mis- 
sion House, Franklin (German Reformed), and Nashotah House, Nashotah (Protestant 
Episcopal), report to the State superintendent a total of 10 instructors, 82 theological 
students, and 11 graduates, the course of study in each extending over 3 years, The 
aggregate value of buildings was reported as $119,000; the number of volumes in 
libraries, 11,000, 968 having been added during the year. : 
The Seminary of St. Francis of Sales, St. Francis, reports grounds and buildings valued 
at $100,000, 12 resident professors and instructors, and a 10-year course of study, but does 
not give the number of students enrolled. 
For further statistics, see Table XI of the appendix, and for a summary, see a corre- 
sponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding, 
Legal instruction is provided in the lawdepartment of the University of Wisconsin. 
The method of instruction is that of lectures, with weekly moot court practice, the course 
_ Tequiring two full years for its completion. Applicants for admission must pass an ex- 
amination in English branches and, unless college graduates, must be at least 20 years 
of age, Fifty students were enrolled during the year, of whom 9 had received a degree 
in letters or science, and 25 were graduated at the commencement of 1882. 
For further statistics, see Table XII of the appendix, and for a summary, a corre- 
sponding table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
There are no medical schools reported. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB, 
The Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Delavan, founded in 
1852, during the 31 years of its existence has given instruction to about 600 deaf pupils. 
Although accurate figures cannot be given, owing to deficiencies in the records, the 
board of supervisors estimate that over 100 students have completed the full course of 
study. They consider that no work undertaken by the State has produced more satis- 
factory results than that of this institution, saying that there are few if any of its pupils 
who have not been here qualified for some pursuit by which they could gain a livelihood. 
They recommend a more liberal expenditure on the instructing force in the school 
proper and in the mechanical departments. In the literary department the common 
soeish branches are taught, including drawing and history, with physiology, natural 
philosophy, and natural history; in theindustrial department, shoemaking, cabinet work, 
printing, baking, and sewing. ‘The institution has a library of 600 volumes; owns 37 
acres of land, the grounds and buildings being valued at $100,000; receives from the 
State an annual appropriation for its support; and gives tuition and board free to its 
ee (Return and State report. ) 
. John’s Deaf-Mute Asylum, St. Francis (Roman Catholic), reporting 48 deaf-mute 
pupils for 1882, gave instruction in christian doctrine, Bible history, writing, reading, 
grammar, arithmetic, geography, United States history, articulation, the finger alphabet, 
and the languages of natural signs; also, in the employments of printing, agriculture, 
needlework, fancy work, and general housework.— (Return. ) 
The Phonological Institute for Deaf-Mutes, Milwaukee, founded in 1878, is under the 
care of the Wisconsin Phonological Institute, an association organized for the purpose of 
propagating the articulate method of instruction. No finger alphabet or other sign lan- 
guage is used. All the elementary branches are taught and the girls also learn needle 
work. Twenty-four pupils were under instruction during 1882. 
For further statistics of deaf-mute schools, see Table XVIII of the appendix, and for a 
summary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
The Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the Blind, Janesville, supported by 
the State, haying grounds and buildings valued at $155,000 and a library of 1,200 vol- 
umes, reports 83 pupils enrolled during the year and 318 since 1850, the year of founda- 
tion. The board of supervisors report that there is a Jarge number of blind of proper age 
in the State, as well as of deaf and dumb, who are not attending school or receiving sys-

tematic instruction of any kind. 'Theschool comprises 3 departments, literary, musical, 
and industrial. In the first the design is to give each pupil a good knowledge of the 
common branches, and, to those who are qualified, instruction in some of the more prac- 
tical of the higher English studies. Careful examinations of the classes are made at 
the middle and close of each term, and scholars are classified according to their daily rec- 
ord combined with the results of the examination. In the music department there are 
three choral classes and an orchestra ; harmony, the New York system of musical nota- 
tion, the piano, cabinet organ, violin, and other instruments receive attention. The 
industrial department affords instruction in carpet weaving, cane seating, fancy work, and 
sewing. Theyoung children obtain from their bead work increased keenness of touch and 
nimbleness of fingers, which assist them in learning to read and write. 
For statistics, see Table XVIII of the appendix, and for a summary, see a correspond- 
ing table in the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Boys, Waukesha, under State coytrol, established 
in 1860, has since had under training nearly 2,000 boys, the number during 1882 being 
299, and that of teachers, officers, and assistants 44. Pupils are taught the common 
English branches, farm work, and the manufacture of boots, shoes, socks, and mittens. 
The school is divided into primary, intermediate, and senior departments, and is graded 
as closely as the frequent changes caused by boys going out and coming in will admit. 
Classes are promoted from one department to another after passing a written examina- 
tion.— (Report and return.) 
The Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls, Milwaukee, under private control though 
aided by the State, takes charge of girls from infancy to 16 years of age, who have com- 
mitted petty offences or are in danger of falling into vicious ways, teaching them the 
common English branches, history, and domestic science, besides house and laundry 
work, common and fine sewing (including the use of the machine), dressmaking, and 
cookery. Seventy-eight per cent. of the inmates discharged are known to have become 
orderly and useful members of society. There were 126 present during the year; 78 
were committed and 72 discharged. The new building, for which the legislature appro- 
priated $15,000, was expected to be ready for occupancy December 1, 1882. 
Another industrial school for girls at Milwaukee, the Good Shepherd Industrial School, 
is under the care of the Roman Catholic Church, though receiving some aid from the 
county. The same church also sustains three orphan asylums in Milwaukee. 
For statistics of reform schoolsreporting, see Table XXI of the appendix, and for a sum- 
mary, see the report of the Commissioner preceding; for statistics of orphan asylums, see 
Table XXII. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
WISCONSIN STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The thirtieth annual session of the Wisoonsin Teachers’ Association was held at Janes- 
ville July 5, 1882. After the opening exercises an address was delivered by Superin- 
tendent James MacAlister, of Milwaukee, on ‘‘ The new education.”’ The address of 
welcome was given by Mayor Croft, of Janesville, and the reply to it by President Albee, 
who then delivered his annual address, in which he reviewed the educational field and 
presented questions to which attention might profitably be directed. The address was 
referred to a committee for the distribution of topics. Addresses were then read on the 
“Likeness of character to objects of thought;’’ ‘‘ Physical culture in our schools;’’ De- 
fects in training and testing teachers; ‘‘ Vocal music in our schools;’’ one on geography 
entitled ‘‘Too much and too little;’’ ‘‘ The danger to mental habits in the knowledge- 
getting of our schools;”’ ‘‘Shall we teach trades in our public schools?” by President 8. 
H. Peabody, of the Illinois Industrial University; ‘‘Some defects in our graded system,”’ 
and ‘‘ Notes upon education abroad.’’ 
After the election of officers for the ensuing year and other routine business, Professor 
Marshall gave a description of the geography and scenery of Yellowstone Park and its 
approaches, when the association adjourned.— (Wisconsin Journal of Education.) 
CONVENTION OF CITY AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The city and county superintendents met July 7, 1882, at Janesville, 23 superintend- 
ents being present. An address was first read by State Superintendent Graham, in 
which, after saying that ‘‘The child is the most precious thing on earth” and refer- 
ring to the enlarged possibilities for improved training due to what is called the new 
education, he proceeded to consider the duty of superintendents in the matter of secur- 
ing good teachers. Other topics discussed were the ‘‘ Relation of superintendents to 
quantity and quality of teachers,’’ ‘‘ National appropriation for common schools,” and
-P-A-G-E-571

‘County libraries.’’ - A resolution was adopted declaring the sense of the convention to 
be that a national appropriation should be made where conditions of illiteracy demand 
it.— (Wisconsin Journal of Education.) 
MEETING OF INSTITUTE CONDUCTORS. 
A special meeting of institute conductors was held in Madison in connection with the 
executive session of the State ‘Teachers’ Association in December, 1881, when schemes 
of work upon the several branches in the third form were presented. and determined upon 
for 1882, and carried out as already mentioned under Training for Teachers, ante, p. 273,

278 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ALASKA. 
GENERAL EDUCATIONAL CONDITION. 
Nearly all thé available information respecting education in Alaska in 1882 will be 
found in the accompanying letters, the first addressed to the Commissioner of Ednca- 
tion and the second to the Secretary of the Interior. It will be observed that different 
parts of the country are referred to in the two reports. 
LETTER OF REY. SHELDON JACKSON. 
Tue BoaRD oF HOME MISSIONS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
23 Centre Street, New York, December 31, 1882. 
Dear Sir: The school work of Alaska is still dependent on private benevolence. In 
the western and southern portions of that vast territory small schools are maintained by 
the Alaska Commercial Company at St. Paul, St. George, Unalashka, and Kadiak, 
and a still smaller school by the Russo-Greek Church at Belkovsky. The principal de- 
velopment of school work, however, is in the southeastern section, known as the Alex- 
ander Archipelago. In the archipelago there are 7 good English schools, 3 of which have 
a boarding and industrial department. Of the 7, 6 are maintained at the expense of the 
board of home missions of the Presbyterian Church. Six of these schools are among 
the Thlinket and one (Jackson) among the Hydah speaking people. 
The Thlinkets are a hardy, self supporting, warlike, superstitious race, whose nameis a 
terror to the civilized Aleuts to the west as well as to the savage Tinneh to the north. 
HAINES, 
Occupying the extreme northern section of Lynn Channel and the valleys of the Chil- 
kat and Chilkut Rivers is the Chilkat tribe, numbering 988. They are the ‘‘ middle- 
men’? of their region, carrying goods to the interior and exchanging them for furs,which 
are brought to the coast and in turn exchanged for more merchandise. Their country is 
on the highway of the gold-seekers to the interior. 
In the summer of 1880 I established a school among them, with Mrs. Sarah Dickinson, 
a Christian Tongas Indian woman, as teacher. In 1881 the station was enlarged by the 
arrival of Rev. Eugene 8. Willard and family from Illinois and the erection of a teacher’s 
residence and school-house. In 1882 Miss Bessie M. Mathews, of Monmouth, Ill., was 
sent out to take charge of a boarding department. The school attendance has been. 
about 75. 
WILLARD. 
Thirty miles up the Chilkat River, in the village of Willard, is a branch school, in 
charge of Mr. and Mrs. Louie Paul, native teachers, with an attendance of 60. 
y BOYD. 
One hundred miles south of Haines is the Hoonyah tribe, occupying oth sides of Cross 
Sound and numbering 908. In 1881 I erected’a school-house and teachers’ residence at 
their principal village on Chichagoff Island, and placed Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Styles, of 
New York City, in charge. The station has been named Boyd. During the year Mr. 
and Mrs. Styles have been transferred to the school at Sitka and the school at Boyd has 
been temporarily closed. 
TSEK/-NUK-SANK’-¥. 
A few miles to the eastward, on Admiralty Island, is the Auk tribe, numbering 340. 
In their region valuable gold mines have been opened and an American mining village 
established at Juneau. A summer school is furnished them by Mrs. W. H. R. Corlies. 
A few miles to the south, on the mainland, is the Takoo tribe, numbering 269. A 
summer school was held among them in 1880 by Rev. and Mrs. W. H. R. Corlies, of 
Philadelphia. In 1882, pressed by the importunities of the leading men of the tribe, Mr. 
Corlies took up his abode among them and erected school and residence buildings at 
‘Tsék/-niik-siink’-y. 
  FORT WRANGELL, 
Around the mouth of the Stickeen River is the Stickeen tribe, numbering 317. Their 
principal village is at Fort Wrangell, on an island of the same name. 
At this point, in the fall of 1877, I located Mrs. A. R. McFarland, the first white 
teacher in southeastern Alaska after the transfer. In 1878 Rev. S. Hall Young, of West 
Virginia, was sent out, and a boarding department for girls established by Mrs. A. R.
-P-A-G-E-573

McFarland. In 1879 Miss Maggie A. Dunbar, of Steubenville, was sent out, and the erec- 
tion of a: suitable building commenced, which was occupied the following year. 
The same year Rev. W. H. R. Corliesand family arrived. Mrs. Corlies opened a school 
on the beach for visiting Indians and her husband a night school for adults. He also 
served as missionary physician to the place. 
In 1882 Rev. John W. McFarland was added to the teaching force. 
The school attendance is from 75 to 90, with 50 girls in the boarding department. 
During the year the dormitory and school building were destroyed by fire. 
JACKSON, 
On the southern half of Prince of Wales Island is the Hydah tribe, numbering 788. 
They are a large and handsome race, with light complexion, and have long been noted 
for their bravery and ferocity. Terrorizing all the neighboring tribes, they were known 
as the ‘bulldogs ’’ of the North Pacific. 
On the 22d of August, 1881, I established a mission among them atthe village of How- 
can, placing Mr. James E. Chapmaninchargeasteacher. In the spring of 1882, Rev. J. 
Loomis Gould and family, of West Virginia, were sent to the Hydahs at Jackson. In 
the fall of that year Miss Clara A. Gould was added to the teaching force. The attend- 
ance is from 60 to 90. SITKA. . 
On the western coast of Baranoff is the Sitka tribe, numbering 721. Their chief vil- 
lage is at Sitka, the old capital of the Russian possessions in America. It'was their politi- 
cal, commercial, religious, and educational centre. As early as 1805 a school was opened 
at Sitka. It hada very precarious existence, however, until 1820, when it came under 
the charge of a naval officer, who kept a good school for thirteen years. In.1833 this 
school fell under the direction of Etolin, who still further increased its efficiency. Eto- 
lin was a creole, who raised himself to the highest position in the country, that of chief 
director of the fur company and governor of the colony. He was a Lutheran and a 
patron of schools and churches. While governor he erected a Protestant church at 
Sitka, and presented it with a small organ, still in use. 
In 1840, besidesthe colonial school at Sitka, was one for orphan boysand sons of employés 
of the fur company, in which were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, me- 
chanical trades, and religion. The most proficient of the pupils at the age of 17 were 
advanced to the colonial school and prepared for the navy or priesthood. The number 
of boarders was limited to 50. The school was in charge of Lieutenant-Commander 
Prince Maxutoff, assistant governor of the colony. In 1847 the attendance was 52; in 
1849, 39; and in 1861, 27. 
Th 1839 a girls’ school of a similar character was established and the number of board- 
ets limited to 40. The course of study comprised the Russian language, reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, household work, sewing, and religion. In 1848 the school numbered. 
323 in 1849, 39; and in 1861, 26, 
In 1841 a theological school was established at Sitka, which, in 1849, was advanced 
to the grade of a seminary. In 1848 it reported 30 boarders, 12 day pupils, and 12 ere- 
oles being educated in Russia. In 1849 the attendance was reported as 28, with 11 
others in Russia. 5 
In 1859 and 1860 the common schools at Sitka were remodelled in order to secure 
greater efficiency. The course of study consisted of Russian, Slavonian, and English lan- 
guages, arithmetic, history, geography, book-keeping, geometry, trigonometry, naviga- 
tion, astronomy, and religion. A knowledge of Russian, reading, writing, and the four 
rules of arithmetic was required for admission. The course extended over five years. 
The faculty consisted of a principal, who was a graduate of the School of Commercial 
Navigation; a free pilot, who taught navigation; an employé of the company, who taught 
book-keeping and commercial branches; one priest and two licentiates, graduates of 
the University of St. Petersburg. The corresponding school for girls was in charge of a 
lady graduate of one of the highest female schools in Russia, with 2 maleteachers. This 
made 5 schools at Sitka, 2 for the children of the lower class, 2 for the higher class, 
and 1 seminary. 
About the time of the transfer the teachers were recalled to Russia and the schools 
suspended. This condition of things lasted until the winter of 1877~'78, when I se- 
cured the appointment of Rev. John G. Brady for Sitka, and in April, 1878, a school 
was opened by Mr. Brady and Miss Fannie E. Kellogg. In December it was discon- 
tinued. In the spring of 1880 Miss Olinda Austin was sent out from New York City, 
and reopened the school April 5 in one of the rooms of the guard-house, with 103 chil- 
dren present. This number increased to 130. Then some of the parents applied for 
admission, but could not be received, as the room would not hold any more. Miss 
Austin received the support and substantial assistance of Captain Beardslee, then in 
command of the United States ship Jamestown, and Lieutenant Symonds, the chief ex-

ecutive officer, who proved themselves warm friends of the enterprise. In July the 
school was moved to the old hospital building. In November some of the boys applied 
to the teacher for permission to live at the school-house. At home there was so much 
drinking, talking, and carousing that they could not study. The teacher said she 
had no accommodations, bedding, or food for them. But they were so much in earnest 
that they said they would provide for themselves. Upon receiving permission, 7 Indian 
boys, 13 and 14 years of age, bringing a blanket each, left their homes and took up their 
abode in a vacant room of one of the Government buildings. Thus commenced the 
boarding department of the Sitka school. Soon other boys joined them. One was 
a boy who, taken out to be shot as a witch, had been rescued by the officers of the 
Jamestown and placed in the school. Capt. Henry Glass, who succeeded Captain 
Beardslee in command of the Jamestown, from the first, with his officers, took a deep 
interest inthe school. As he had opportunity he secured boys from distant tribes and 
placed them in the school, until there are 27 boys in the boarding department. 
In February, 1881, Captain Glass established a rule compelling the attendance of the 
Indian children upon the day school, which was a move in the right direction and has 
worked admirably. He first caused the Indian village to be cleaned up, ditches dug 
around each house for drainage, and the houses whitewashed. These sanitary regula- 
tions have already greatly lessened the sickness and death-rate among them. He then 
caused the houses to be numbered and an accurate census taken of the inmates, 
adults and children. He then caused a label to be made of tin for each child, which 
was tied around the neck of the child, with his or her number and the number of the 
house on it, so that if a child was found on the street during school hours the Indian 
policeman was under orders to take the numbers on the labels and report them, or the 
teacher each day would report that such numbers from such houses were absent that day. 
The following morning the head Indian of the house to which the absentee belonged 
‘was summoned to appear and answer for the child. If the child was wilfully absent, 
the head man was fined or imprisoned. A few cases of fine were sufficient. As soon as 
they found the captain in earnest, the children were all in school. This ran the average 
attendance up to 230 and 250, one day reaching, with adults, 271. In April Mr. Alonzo 
E. Austin was associated with his daughter in the school and Mrs. Austin-was appointed 
matron. ‘ 
Early in 1882 the school met a great loss in the destruction of its building by fire. It 
is in contemplation to replace the burned building with a substantial two-story frame 
and increase the corps of teachers. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION, 
On the completion of the new building a boarding department will be created for girls, 
So that both sexes may enjoy the advantages of an industrial training. The school at- 
tendance has been about 200. 
With the increase of public attention to Alaska and the growing interest of the coun- 
try in the education of Indian children in industrial schools, the time has come to en- 
large the industrial department of the school at Sitka. ‘ 
The nearest school of the kind to Alaska is at Forest Grove, Oreg.' But Forest Grove 
is 1,500 miles distant from Southeastern Alaska and 2,500 miles away, by present routes 
of travel, from Southwestern Alaska. Then, the resources and character of the two coun- 
tries are different. Oregon is largely agricultural, while Alaska’s agricultural interests 
are of slight importance. As the object of an industrial training is to enable the boy, 
upon arriving at manhood, to earn a support that will sustain his family in a civilized way, 
it is important to train him to utilize the resources of his own country. The resources of Alaska, in addition to the fur-bearing animals, are her vast supply of fish and great for- 
ests. Therefore the training school of her children should be on the coast, where they 
can be taught navigation and seamanship; the handling of boats and sails; improved 
methods of fishing and handling fish nets; improved methods of salting, canning, and 
preparing fish for market. With a saw-mill, a carpenter shop, cooper shop, boot and 
shoe shop, the school should be one in which pupils may be taught both theory and 
practice under conditions similar to those they will meet when they undertake to sup- 
port themseives. f 
The need of such enlargement is urgent. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALASKA AND THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION, 
A new era is opening for Alaska. Two years ago gold mines were opened about 160 
miles northeast of Sitka, and the mining village of Juneau was established. From these 
mines gold dust worth $150,000 was taken last season. Rich discoveries were also re- ported in the valley of the Upper Yukon River. These reports have considerable interest 
in the mining regions of Arizona and the Pacific coast, and hundreds have, within the 
past few months, gone to Alaska. 
As a mining excitement first opened California, Colorado, and Montana to settlement, 
so the present movement may bethe commencement of the developmentof Alaska. That
-P-A-G-E-575
  ALASKA. 281 4 
development has already commenced. In addittonto the quartz mills and mining inter- 
ests, trading posts have been established at a number of native villages. The North- 
west Trading Company has established extensive works at Killisnoo forthe manufacture of 
fish oil. Four salmon canneries have been established at different points, and several 
fisheries at others. Extensive cod-fisheries are in operation at the banks, off of the 
Shumagin dslands, and saw-mills are running at Sitka, Roberts, Klawack, and Jackson. 
‘These changesagain bring up the question ofeducation. Shall thenative population be 
left, as in the past, to produce, under the encroachments of the incoming whites, a new 
crop of costly, bloody, and cruel Indian wars, or shall they be so educated that they will 
become useful factors in the new development? The native races are partially civil- 
ized, industrious, anxious for an education, readily adopt the ways of the whites, and, 
with the advantages of schools, will quickly, to all intents and purposes, become citizens. 
‘To aceomplish this requires the sympathy and coéperation of the friends of education 
throughout the country. 
Very respectfully yours, 
SHELDON JACKSON. 
Hon. Joun Eaton, 
United States Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C. 
LETTER OF IVAN PETROFF, ESQ. 
WASHINGTON, D. C., February, 1882. 
Str: In compliance with your kind suggestion, I have the honor to lay before you a 
communication on the subject of education in Alaska, 
A letter on this subject written by the Rev. Sheldon Jackson has already been for- 
warded to the United States Senate and printed as an executive document, but, as this 
letter deals almost exclusively with the southeastern section of the Territory, I think 
that a brief statement concerning the western portion of Alaska, containing the greatest 
number of semicivilized natives, may be acceptable. 
The Innuit tribes inhabiting the coast from Mount St. Elias westward and northward 
have all long since been brought under the influence of the Greek Catholic Church, and 
in the principal trading centres, the Kadiak Archipelago, and the Aleutian group of isl- 
ands a population of mixed blood has sprung up, numbering several thousand, who, 
under the Russian rule of nearly a hundred years’ duration, had made considerable ad- 
vance in civilization. The actual membership on the islands and the continental coast 
is now reported at between eight and nine thousand; and of these less than five hun- 
dred, nearly all of the mixed or creole class, are able to read and write in their own lan- 
guage, for which an alphabet had been provided and books printed by the Russians. 
Perhaps 25 per cent. of the number mentioned can also read and write in Russian. The 
schools formerly maintained by the Russian-American Company have, of course, been 
discontinued, and the priests of the Russian Church have neglected educational work 
altogether. At present the only school maintained by the church authorities in the 
Territory is located at Belkovsky, the central settlement of the sea-otter hunting grounds; 
but here the attendance is irregular and very small. On the island of Unalashka the 
Alaska Commercial Company maintains at its own expense a school with a competent 
Russian and English teacher, an institution which has been conducted for the last two 
years with the most gratifying success; but, as it owes its existence solely to the liberality 
of a mercantile firm, there can be no certainty as to its continuation in the future. 
On the so-called Fur Seal Islands, the reservation of the Treasury Department, the 
lessees are obliged, under the terms of the lease, to keep a school on each of the islands 
of St. Pauland St. George for eight months of the year. This proviso has been faith- 
fally carried out since the year 1870. On the island of St. Paul the teacher is a young 
native of the island who received his training at the State Normal School of Vermont 
and graduated from that institution after a constant attendance of seven years. He is 
now an accomplished gentleman, an excellent musician, and his success in teaching his 
countrymen has been very satisfactory. x 
The average daily attendance at the school of St. Paul is reported by the Government 
agent as 69 and numerous ‘specimens of penmanship and composition testify to the pro- 
ficiency of the school and scholars. On the island of St. George, with a much smaller 
population, the average daily attendance is reported as 22. é 
A small number of boys from Western Alaska receive schooling at San Francisco, Cal:, 
under the supervision of the Russian bishop of the Alaskan diocese. These youths are 
designed for the church, but the present enljghtened and progressive bishop makes them 
attend the public schools. 
This comprises all the educational facilities extended thus far. fo the inhabitants of 
Western Alaska. 
But very little progress has been made in introducing the English language among the 
natives of all that vast region west of the meridian of Mount St. Elias. -'The traders and

fishermen, the only Americans who thus far have gone among them, have found it easier 
to pick up the peculiar idiom current along the coast than to indute the natives to adopt 
the English, and it is safe to assert that in all the section referred to the people are as 
little acquainted with American customs and institutions as they were at the time of 
their transfer from Russia to the United States. 
As efforts are now being made to procure an appropriation for the establishment of 
schools in Alaska, it is to be hoped that due attention will be paid to the rights and wants 
of the people who inhabit the more remote regions of the Territory, whence all the 
revenue is derived which it is proposed to expend for the purpose, but who are not rep- 
resented in Washington by any advocate of their interests. 
‘The schools now in existence in Southeastern Alaska are maintained and controlled by 
the Presbyterian Board of Missions, and are necessarily sectarian in their tendency. 
‘These schools have the most beneficial effect among the savage tribes coming under their 
immediate influence, and they are certainly entitled to any assistance it is in the power 
of Congress to give; but among the seven or eight thousand members of the Russian 
Church, where the necessity of fostering education is most urgent, such schools would be 
a failure, owing to the influence of the Russian clergy, who would prevent the attend- 
ance of children and youths in schools conducted by Protestant missionaries and their 
teachers. Such sectarian prejudices are of course to be deplored, but as long as they 
exist they should be taken into consideration by those who wish to benefit the people by 
the extension of educational facilities. 
With regard to the best mode of spreading knowledge and civilization among these 
people inhabiting the coasts and islands between Prince William Sound and Unalashka, 
I would respectfully suggest the establishrnent of one or two industrial schools, centrally 
located between these points. The segregation of youths to be instructed from their 
families I consider essential; the mode of life of these sea-otter hunters is such that no 
regular school attendance could be secured in any one village or settlement. The fami- 
lies move about in quest of fish and game as the season changes, and all children livihg 
with the family necessarily move with it. At first it would be most advisable to col- 
lect as pupils for the industrial school the sons of chiefs or headmen of the villages, who 
would be most influential in demonstrating the benefits of education to their people. At 
two points in the section of Alaska referred to, the Government already has extensive 
puildings erected by the military forces once stationed in the Territory. These build- 
ings could be fitted up for educational purposes at comparatively little expense. These 
points are Rensi, on Cook’s Inlet, and St. Paul Harbor, on Kadiak Island. When I visited 
those places during last summer the buildings were in a good state of repair. There 
can be no doubt that both natives and creoles (descendants of Russians from native 
mothers) are possessed of considerable ability and intelligence. Quite a number of the 
latter class held prominent and responsible positions under the Russian Government, but 
unfortunately these individuals left for Russia, together with the other officials of the 
Russian-American Company, shortly after the transfer of the Territory. 
My experience in travelling among these people for the last four years has convinced 
me that schools maintained by the Government, not by the missionaries, will be heartily 
welcomed and supported by the Christian inhabitants of the western coast and islands 
and-that such institutions will receive every assistance from the trading and fishing 
firms engaged in business there. ‘ 
Hoping that in the case of the necessary appropriation being made by Congress this 
communication may be of some assistance to those who will be charged with the-execu- 
tion of educational projects for Alaska, I remain, very respectfully,

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. - 
OFFICERS. 
The school system of Arizona is conducted by a territorial board of education, a super- 
intendent of public instruction, county superintendents, county boards of 3 examiners, 
and a board of 3 school trustees for each district. 
The members of the territorial board of education are the governor, the territorial 
treasurer, and the superintendent of public instruction. The county probate judge is 
ex officio county superintendent; in his educational capacity he is the presiding officer 
of the county board of examiners, his colleagues holding their appointments from the 
superintendent of public instruction. The territorial superintendent and the boards of 
school trustees are elected, the first biennially by the Territory at large, the latter annually 
by the voters of the districts over whose school affairs they have jurisdiction. 
The board of education moulds the system and the superintendent administersit. The 
duties required of the probate judge when acting as county superintendent seem to be 
of a passive rather than an active kind, the more professional work devolving on the 
district boards or on the teachers themselves. The county board of examiners grants 
two kinds of certificates, one good for life, the other for 6 years. The district boards of 
school trustees exercise full power in local school affairs, subject to the rules and regu- 
lations of the territorial board. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Three species of school taxation are provided for by the law: The first, which is obliga~ 
tory, consists of a territorial tax of .15 of 1 per cent., known as the territorial school fund, 
and of a county tax of not less than .5of 1 nor more than .8 of 1 per cent. on taxable prop- 
   
-P-A-G-E-578
284 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
erty, known as the county school fund; the second is a conditional tax, only required of 
those districts in which the apportionment of the obligatory tax is inadequate to secure 
3 months of school; the third is an optional tax, for prolonging the school term beyond 
the 3-month limit or for building school-houses, voted by the district at a meeting called 
by the board of trusteees. 
The territorial fund is apportioned to the counties on the basis of school population, 
becoming a part of the county fund, which is distributed among the districts, one-fourth 
equally and the remainder in proportion to the averageschool attendance of each district 
during the preceding 3 months. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
‘The meagre statistics render a comparison of figures impossible, and any statement of 
the educational condition of the Territory must be based on the conelusions arrived at by 
the superintendent of public instruction. The schools, though now established on a firm 
basis, need that general supervision which the law requires of the superintendent, but 
which the insufficiency of the legislative appropriation will not permit him to give, Nor 
is the want of general supervision the only hindrance of its kind. The time of the ex 
officio county superintendent is so constantly taken up by his duties as probate judge 
that he also lacks opportunity for personal supervision, and finally, from the laxity of 
the examinations, candidates are in some cases passed who are incompetent. On the 
other hand, two items of progress are given: the adoption of a uniform system of text 
books, thereby facilitating the work of the teacher and the progress of the pupil, and the 
increase in the number of school-houses. 5 
To sum up, it appears that the territorial system has by far too few children and far 
too wide a territory under its control to do its work either pregisely or economically. 
SCHOOL SYSTEM OF TUCSON. 
STATISTICS. 
Tucson has not, strictly speaking, a city system, being school district No. 1 of Pima 
County. The report of the principal of its one school building shows 6 teachers, in- 
cluding the principal and his assistant, and a special teacher of Spanish and another of 
vocal music. The regular teachers were paid on the average a monthly salary of $100 
and thespecials $50. ‘The enrolment in theschools was for the year 281, an increase of 72. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
Whenever a county contains 20 districts a teachers’ institute is required by law to 
be held at least once a year and to continue not less than 3 nor more than 5 days, every 
public school teacher in the county being required to attend. 
Whether the contingency has not arisen or the meetings, if held, have failed to be 
noticed cannot be determined, as no report or mention of them appears. 
SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
SECONDARY. 
The Territory has not as yet made any provision for the instruction of its children 
beyond the common school course, but the city superintendent of Tombstone speaks 
of high school studies being taught in his own schools and probably in thosé of Tucson, 
Prescott; and Pheenix. 
SUPERIOR. 
‘There are no schools of this class, either territorial or private. 
Taking advantage of the act of Congress of February 18, 1881, granting public lands 
for university purposes to the Territories, the superintendent, with the aid of the regis- 
ter of the land office at Prescott, located the seventy-two sections allowed Arizona, 
securing the most valuable timber lands in the Territory.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The system is administered by a superintendent of public instruction, county super- 
intendents, a board of education for every incorporated city, town, or village, and town- 
ship boards.  Biennially appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislative 
council, the territorial superintendent exercises the usual duties of general supervision 
and compilationof statistics. The county superintendent (women being eligible to elec- 
tion) is chosen biennially; he has charge of the county educational interests and is the 
medium through which the territorial superintendent acts on the subordinate county 
officers. ‘The township board is composed of a director, clerk, and treasurer, chosen for 
3-year terms, one going out annually. It is the duty of this board to provide buildings, 
employ teachers, regulate the schools, and disburse the funds of the township. The 
city, town, or village boards of education are governed by special laws. : x 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Taxation is of two kinds: (1) a general tax of $1 on each elector and 2 per cent. on 
property, to be distributed to districts that maintained 3 months of school during the pre- 
ceding year, and (2) a local tax, not to exceed 3 per cent. of the taxable property of the 
district in which it is levied. The general tax, or public fund, as it is called, is increased 
by penalties of various kinds and is distributed according to the population of school 
age (5 to 21) in each district.

286 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The statistics of Dakota are not unnaturally incomplete. Educational statistics are 
primarily dependent on local supervision, and when citizens having neither time nor 
technical knowledge for compiling statistics are elected supervisors, information will be 
wanting, the law to the contrary notwithstanding. In Dakota, this more or less general 
evil is aggravated by a municipal system peculiar for its entire independence of that of 
the Territory, which is fast removing the more populous places from the superintendent’s 
control. 
Though the condition of the Territory relatively to the preceding year cannot be 
given, some idea of what is being done in the cause of education may be derived froma 
comparison of the figures at hand for the year under consideration. Of the 33 counties 
reporting, 29 returned an enrolment of 67 per cent. on their reported school popula- 
tion; 25, as having sittings for 77 per cent. of their children of school age; 17, as having 
on an average a teacher to every 25 of the enrolment; and 24, as expending $13.04 per 
pupil enrolled. These figures are by no means discouraging, and, although some of the 
newly organized counties failed to report, the tendency their statistics might have to de- 
preciate the educational condition would be counterbalanced by the more favorable re- 
turns from nearly as many of the oldest counties that have likewise failed to réport. 
One noticeable item in the superintendent’s report, however, is the low average pay of 
teachers in a community where the school year is rarely 5 months. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM OF YANKTON. © 
ADMINISTRATION. 
There are no places in Dakota having the requisite population to entitle them to men- 
tion here ; but it is thought advisable to introduce the statistics of Yankton, the largest 
place in the Territory and the only city reporting statistics. 
As has been previously said the municipal system or systems, for each is of its own 
kind, are in no way subordinate to the territorial system; thus any incorporated city, 
town, or village may isolate itself, its only obligation being to report its school popula- 
tion when it desires to obtain its pro rata share of the public fund. 
STATISTICS. 
Under a board of education, composed of 8, and its secretary, the Yankton system 
seems to he progressing in everything except school accommodations. The population of 
the place (3,690) comprised 803 children 6-16; of these, 646 were enrolled. The popu- 
lation of school age (5-21) was 1,186; of this number 738 were enrolled in public and 120 
in private schools, and 479 of the public and 100 of the private school enrolment were 
in average daily attendance. The 10 schools, one of which was a high school, were 
accommodated in five buildings, containing 571 sittings, and were taught 175 days. 
School property owned by the city was valued at $14,000, and the expenditure for schools, 
exglusive of payments for previous indebtedness, was $11,918. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS, 
NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The Dakota Normal School, Springfield, reports 17 normal and 18 other students in 
attendance during the last year, and 10 graduates engagéd in teaching. The institution 
has 3 instructors, a model school, a course of 3 years of 36 weeks each, and grants certifi- 
cates to its graduates authorizing them to teach in the public schools. The school is 
endowed with twenty sections of public land and received last year an appropriation of 
$800 from the city of Springfield. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
There is a normal course of 3 years provided in the academic department of the Uni- 
versity of Dakota, designed to prepare pupils for teaching either in the common or high 
schools, 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
High schools, though not required by law, have been established in the larger towns. 
The high school of Yankton, the only one of which statistics are at hand, had 3 teachers, 
an average membership of 40, and an average attendance of 38 for the year. The. course, 
4 years in length, is academic in character and had 10 graduates in 1882.

DISTRICT SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The absence of suffrage in the District of Columbia places the choice of the 9 members 
of the board of trustees, which is the educational authority, in the hands of the com- 
missioners of the District. This board annually selects 2 superintendents, who are its 
chief executive officers, and chooses supervising principals, who act under the supervision 
of these superintendents; through its committee on teachers the board of trustees also 
appoints an examining board composed of the 2 superintendents and an undefined num- 
ber of supervising principals and principals of public schools. To assign each super- 
intendent to his proper sphere of action, the public schools have been formed into 8 divis- 
ions, the first four comprising the white schools of Washington, the fifth those of George- 
town, and the sixth therural schools, over all of which one of the superintendents exercises 
authority; the seventh and eighth, comprising the colored schools of Washington and 
Georgetown, are under the control of his colleague.

OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
To support the system Congress makes an annual appropriation, one half of which is 
taken from the amount raised by local taxation and the other from the public funds of 
the United States. Theschool age is 6-17; the schools are all graded, with a few excep- 
tions among the rural schools, and each race is taught by instructors of its own color. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
As no statistics have been published for 1882, the comparative standing of the year can- 
not be determined except as to the items of receipts and expenditures, each in 1882 
amounting to $579,312, being increases of $23,668 and $52,000, respectively, over the 
preceding year. The statistics of the white schools of Washington are given under the 
following head: 
WHITE SCHOOLS OF WASHINGTON. 
With a white school population of 27,142, Washington enrolled 17,306, of whom 13,168 
were in average daily attendance, under 293 teachers, and had in private schools an enrol- 
mentof 5,000. The 54 buildings contained 244rooms and 14,552 sittings forstudy. The 
schools were taught 186 days and instruction in music and drawing was given by special 
teachers. Compared with the preceding year the gains were 899 in enrolment, 530 in 
average daily attendance, 35 in teachers, and 115 in sittings for study. The number of 
days the schools were taught was less by 4.

dix under the title of Garfield Kindergarten Training School, having been organized in 
October, 1882. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The Washington high school, for whites of either sex, furnishes no statistics for 1881-’82. 
It has academic and scientific courses, each of 3 years, and a business course of 2, and at 
the beginning of the year 1882-’83 had 382 students, under 11 instructors, with special 
teachers of drawing and music. 
OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
For information respecting business colleges, private academic schools, preparatory 
schools, or preparatory departments of colleges, see Tables IV, VI, VII, and IX of the 
appendix; and for summaries of them, see corresponding tables in the report of the Com- 
' missioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
COLLEGES FOR YOUNG MEN OR FOR BOTH SEXES. 
The 5 institutions for superior instruction are Georgetown College, Georgetown, and 
Gonzaga College, Washington (both Roman Catholic), and Columbian University, How- 
ard University, and the National Deaf-Mute College; the last 3, in Washington, report 
themselves non-sectarian. Only one of the above, Howard University, is open to young 
women as well as men. 
Georgetown College provides a preparatory course of 3 years, a classical of 4, and a sci- 
entific of 3. The degree of bachelor of arts is conferred on graduates of the regular clas- 
sical course, which comprises Latin, Greek, French (or some other modern language), 
mathematics, rational philosophy, physics, mechanics, and chemistry. A graduate 
course in ethics and natural philosophy leads to the degree of master of arts. 
Columbian University has the regular collegiate course of study arranged in 7 schools, 
viz, English, Greek, Latin, modern languages, mathematics, natural science, and phi- 
losophy. By selections from these, courses are formed leading to the degrees of bachelor 
of arts, bachelor of letters, and bachelor of science. The degree of master of arts is given 
to students who have been graduated from all the schools and have passed a satisfactory

examination on the studies embraced in them. The university received a valuable gift 
during the year from Hon. W. W. Corcoran, consisting of a large lot of ground in Wash- 
ington for the erection of a building to accommodate its collegiate and law departments. 
Gonzaga College divides its course of study into 2 departments: the collegiate course 
proper, including the Greek and Latin classics, and the non-classical, embracing the Eng- 
lish language and literature, mathematics, and the natural sciences. Twenty-two stu- 
dents were reported in the collegiate course and 85 in other studies. 
Howard University offers collegiate, theological, legal, medical, preparatory, and normal 
departments, to which all are admitted, irrespective of race, sex, or creed, who are pre- 
pared to pursue the studies in which they propose to engage. There is also a literary 
course, which may be completed in 5 years from the first preparatory, the regular col- 
legiate requiring 7. Fifteen students were reported in regular collegiate classes during 
1882, and 32 in preparatory. <A gift of $5,000 was received during the year from Han- 
nah §. Toland, of Germantown, for the benefit of the theological department. 
The National Deaf-Mute College, the collegiate department of Columbia Institution for 
the Instruction of the Deafand Dumb, reports an introductory course of 1 year, an under- 
graduate one of 4 years for the degree of B. A., and select courses of 3 years in science, 
philosophy, and literature. There were 28 undergraduate students during the year, and 
53 in the preparatory department.

ized 3-year course, including Hebrew and Greek. This department is supported entirely 
by the American Missionary Association and the presbytery of Washington City, but is 
open to students of all Christian denominations who pass the required examination for 
admission. Wayland Seminary (Baptist) in its theological department prepares stu- 
dents for the ministry ; they devote a part of each day during the entire course to Bible 
studies. 
Legal.—The law departments of Columbian, Georgetown, Howard, and National Uni- 
versities each gave a 2-year course of Jegal instruction, leading to the degree of bachelor 
of laws. Three years of study being required to secure admission to the bar of the Dis- 
trict, each school adds a year of graduate study, on the completion of which the degree 
of master of laws is conferred. 
Medical.— The National Medical College of the Columbian University and the med- 
ical departments of Georgetown College and Howard University all continued their 3- 
year graded courses. Georgetown held its sessions 8 months in the year, and the others 
5. Howard required for admission an examination in English and Latin and George- 
town held an examination at the close of each term. 
The National College of Pharmacy required for graduation 4 years of experience in the 
. practice of pharmacy, 2 full courses of lectures of 5 months each, and a course occupying 
10 weeks in practical and analytical chemistry. 
For statistics of the legal, medical, and pharmaceutical schools, see Tables XII and 
XIII of the appendix, and for summaries, see the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. 
- EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Kendall Green, near Washington, 
including the National Deaf-Mute College, reported 111 pupils for 1882, of whom 17 
were young women. There were 60 in the primary department. The number of pupils 
taught articulation had increased, and the result was encouraging. Great benefit is said 
to have resulted from the active gymnastic exercises, each student being required to 
spend 4 hours a week in physical training. 
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
There being no institution for the blind in the District of Columbia, the Government 
continued in 1882 to make provision for them in the Maryland Institution for the Blind. 
There were 4 in 1882 from the District receiving instruction in that institution.

REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The Reform School of the District of Columbia (1869) up to July, 1882, had received 812 
boys; 99 were committed during the year and 87 discharged, leaving in the school 143. 
The average age of boys received since the opening is 13} years, the oldest being 18 and 
the youngest 6. A workshop was built in 1882, at a cost of $3,516, and the chair work 
removed to it, where it is carried on more satisfactorily. Common school studies were 
pursued and the industries taught were farming, chair caning, shoemaking, and tailor- 
ing, by which the boys earned $1,631. The money so earned is paid them on their final 
discharge from the institution. 
The Industrial Home School (for both sexes), Georgetown, cared for 116 children during 
the year, received 47 and discharged 46, of whom 20 were returned to parents and 22 pro- 
vided with homes. During the year the industries have been reorganized, so that one 
half attend school in the forenoon, the otherin the afternoon. Work is done in the green- 
house, shoe and carpenter shops. Under a special instructor, 171 pairs of shoes were 
made and 216 repaired, being enough to supply the institution. The new cottage build- 
ing for girls was furnished and occupied. Considering thelimited means at hand, the in- 
stitution has been successful. The income for the year was $14,691, of which Congress 
gave $5,000.— (Report. ) 
CHILDREN’S HOMES AND ORPHAN ASYLUMS. 
The St. Vincent's Female Orphan Asylum, with an average of 125 children from 6 to 12 
years of age, a day school for girls in the same building, with an average of 150 pupils, 
and the St. Rose’s Female Orphan and Industrial Asylum, a branch of St. Vincent’s, are 
essentially one institution. St. Vincent’s orphan department is supported by the tui- 
tion fees of the day school. The orphan girls on leaving this school go to the branch de- 
partment, where they are trained from 4 to 6years in the more advanced English studies 
and in ordinary housework, but mostly in common sewing, dressmaking, and embroidery. 
By these last industries the institution, with an average of 43 inmates, is made self sus- 
taining. Ata suitable age homes are provided for them. 
The St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum for Boys, with an average of 115 children, is also con- 
nected with a boys’ day school, with an average attendance of 85, and is entirely sup- 
ported by it. Children are received from 6 to 12 years of age and placed in homes as soon 
as possible after reaching 12 years of age. ‘Teachers of these schools receive no salary. 
The Washington City Orphan Asylum, in its sixty-eighth year, had a family of 139 or- 
phan children, of whom 11 were infants under 1 yearold. ‘This infant department has 
been added during the year and occupies an addition built by Dr. J.C. Hall. No girl is 
now allowed to leave the institution till 18 yearsof age, unless it be Isy adoption in some 
permanent home. By far the greater part of those who have left have become good men 
and women and useful citizens. The asylum continues to be managed by the ladies of 
the city and to depend on the charities of the public. 
The German Protestant Orphan Asylum, Uniontown, had 33 inmates, a decrease of 8 
from the previous year. In the general management, as reported in 1881~-’82, no change 
is noted. Of the 33 inmates 21 attended the public school in Uniontown, 
In the Home established by the National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored 
Women and Children 128 inmates were cared for during the year, of whom 7 were aged women and 128 children. Homes were found for 26 and 35 werereceived. In theschool there has been a marked improvement since it was made a part of the public school sys- tem of the District. In the industrial school, where the average age of the workers was 8 years, there were made 104 pairs of stockings and all the bedding and clothing, except the hats and shoes, needed by the institution. The need of a new substantial building 
be engaging the attention of the association. To this charity Congress appropriated 
16,535. 
TRAINING OF NURSES. 
The Washington Training School for Nurses, after an existence of a little more than 4 years, reported for 1882 7 instructors, 33 pupils, and its first graduating class, consist- ing of 3 students, who finished the regular 2-year course. Of these 1 continues in the profession and finds ready and remunerative employment. 
From its organization this useful institution has been in need of funds to place it on the same foundation as those established in other places, its only income being from mem- bership dues. Still, regular medical courses have been maintained. 
SCHOOL OF COOKERY. 
The Mission Free School of Cookery and Housework was opened January 1, 1881, with 7 pupils, the object being to give free instruction in cookery to girls, both white and col- ored, under 18 years of age, who are unable to pay for it. 
More recently a ladies’ class has been added for.those who are able topay. With the

limited space and means at their control” the committee have not been able to carry out 
their plans as they would like. Still the success has been more than was expected. It 
is believed that this good work, so favorably inaugurated in Washington, will greatly 
increase. 
TRAINING IN ART AND. MUSIC. 
So far as can be ascertained no important change has occurred within the year 1882 in 
respect to the training in art reported for 1881 in the schools of Mr. W. M. Rouzee, Mr. 
Edmund C. Messer, Mrs. 8. E. Fuller, or Mrs. Imogene R. Morrell, except that in Mr. 
Rouzee’s case at least additional facilities for instruction were secured in a new build- 
ing, with greater conveniences for effective and pleasant work. 
The Washington Conservatory of Music, under the direction of Mr. O. B. Bullard, is 
believed to have continued its instructions in vocal and instrumental music, as also the 
School of Music of Mr. Theo. Ingalls King, while the Georgetown Conservatory of Music 
was added to these in 1882. 
EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
A voluntary association of the graduates of the Normal School for Whites meets once 
a month to compare experiences in government and teaching.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. & 
The territorial controller is ex officio superintendent of public instruction and county 
auditors are ex officio county school superintendents. Each county has a board of exam- 
iners and each district a board of 3 trustees. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
The public schools are sustained. by the income of an irreducible and indivisible school 
fand, by a county tax of not less than 2 nor more than 8 mills on the dollar, by moneys 
arising from legal fines and forfeitures, and by fees paid by teachers for certificates of 
qualification. ‘The basis of distribution of the school moneys by the territorial treasurer 
is the number of children of school age (5-21) in each county, according to the last cen- 
sus report. Each county treasurer divides one half of this amount equally among the 
organized districts in the county, the other half to be apportioned per capita among the 
several districts in proportion to the children, irrespective of age, except in 2 counties, 
which have a different arrangement. 
Districts may levy special taxes for building or repairing school-houses, and, when the 
cost of repairs does not exceed $25, the trustees may levy a rate bill, to be collected from 
such patrons of the school as are able to pay it. No district or teacher is to receive any 
of the public school money if political or sectarian doctrines have been taught in the 
schools or books, papers, tracts, or documents of this character have been distributed.

  294 - REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The superintendent of public instruction, in his report for 1881 and 1882, speaks of the 
continued, embarrassments in his work arising from the defects in the school system and 
lack of funds. Being only an ex officio school officer, with but little time for school work 
and with no salary as superintendent, his supervision of school interests is imperfect; 
and the same being true of the county superintendents, their supervision of schools is 
also defective. He calls attention especially to the absence of any provision for teachers’ 
institutes; to the lack of care in the selection of teachers; to the fact that the pay of 
teachers was too small to command good ones where most needed; that in many districts 
the school term was only 3 months; and that he was able to report but 2 graded schools. 
Under such circumstances, he says, true education is next to an impossibility.

SCHOOL SYSTEMS AMONG THE INDIANS. 
OFFICERS. 
So far as can be ascertained, the school systems of the Five Nations are nearly the same. 
The Cherokees have a board of education, consisting of 3 persons of liberal literary attain- 
ments, appointed by the principal chief and confirmed by the senate, who appoint to each 
primary school 3 directors for local supervision. Among the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
-P-A-G-E-590
  296 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Creeks, and Seminoles there are superintendents of public schools, boards of education 
for general control, and for local supervision trustees who have charge of the schools in 
the districts into which the territory of each tribe is divided. 
Through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, th€Government continues to intrust the 
educational work among the tribal Indians (except in Alaska) largely to several relig- 
ious associations. 
The schools at Hampton, Va.; Carlisle, Pa.; and at Forest Grove, Oreg., authorized by 
the Government, continue the training of large numbers of Indian youth of either sex, 
sent by the chiefs and headmen of various tribes. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS. 
The Cherokees class their public schools as primary and high and provide for a male 
and female seminary, which are the high schools, and an orphan asylum. The board of 
education makes the rules for the government and studies of these schools, each of its 3 
members having the supervision of 1 of the 3 districts into which the nation is divided. 
Each one is required to report the number of children of school age (7-21) in his district, 
number of each sex, their language and nationality, and number of orphans, and to visit 
semiannually all schools in his district. The hoard may establish industrial boarding 
schools. It must examine all applicants for the position of teacher. The school year 
has 2 terms, one of 20, the other of 16 weeks. Qualifications being equal, preference 
must be given to the applications of native teachers for places in the primary and high 
schools. ‘Tuition is free only to children of citizens of the Cherokee Nation. Provision 
is also made for the establishment and support of asylums for the insane, indigent, blind, 
and deaf and dumb. 
The Choctaws have 6 national schools, of which 2 are academies and 4 seminaries for 
females, consisting of a specified number of youth from each district. The minor schools 
are called neighborhood schools, of which previous to 1881 there could be but 2 in a 
county, and these 8 miles apart. By act of 1881 this was repealed, and all districts in- 
cluding 10 Choctaw children of school age (7-18) are entitled to a neighborhood school. 
Among the tribal Indians there is yet no uniform school system, studies and methods 
of instruction being left with the missions to which the Government has largely com- 
mitted the work, the teachers employed being paid by the Government. 
It is becoming more and more apparent that the best method of training the youth of 
these tribes is to gather them into large boarding institutions, such as those now in suc- 
cessful operation. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The whole Indian population in 1882, exclusive of Alaska, was 262,366, with a school 
population of 43,977 as farasreported. There were enrolled in schools of all kinds 14,394, 
or under 33 percent. of Indian youthin school. Of these, 5,639 were of the Five Nations 
and 8,755 of the tribal Indians. In total population there was a gain of 515 over 1881. 
The enrolment in the Five Nations shows a loss of 544; that of the tribal Indians, a gain 
of 646 and in average attendance of 593. The number of Indians who could read, includ- 
ing the civilized nations, fell off 346 as reported, while the number taught to read dur- 
ing the year in the uncivilized tribes was 198 higher than the number taught the year be- 
fore. Among both classes of Indians the number of boarding and day schoolsslightly in- 
creased. There was a considerable increase in the teachers and missionaries having charge 
of schools. The whole expenditure for Indian education increased $107,593 over 1881. 
These figures, with all concurrent reports, indicate asteady advance, especially among 
the tribal Indians, notwithstanding the usual embarrassments occasioned by the presence 
of white men. 
COMBINED EDUCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Increased importance is being attached to the agency of industrial boarding schools. 
They have come to be regarded as the centre of Indian civilization and as doing pioneer 
work. In each of the reservation boarding schools the girls are trained inall the branches 
of household industry, in making and repairing garments, in kitchen, laundry,dining room, 
dormitory, and sewing room work, in doing which they receive as thorough and constant 
instruction in the art of home-making as in reading and writing the English language. 
Industrial training for boys is receiving more attention every year. During the last 
year, in connection with 57 reservation boarding schools, 1,245 acres of land were put under 
cultivation, and the crop amounted to 8,370 bushels of corn, 3,698 of oats, 11,683 of 
vegetables, 1,248 of wheat, 154 tons of hay, and other products in proportion. The 
teaching of trades is rapidly being introduced. Tailoring, blacksmithing, and harness 
making were already taught in 4 of these schools, shoemaking in 7, carpentry in 10, and 
raising and care of stock in 15. 
The success in industrial training at Carlisle, Hampton, and Forest Grove has greatly 
stimulated the efforts just mentioned. In these latter schools good work has been accom~

plished. during the year. Carlisle-numbered 284 pupils from 33 tribes; Forest Grove, 
91 from?10)tribes; ‘ Hampton,‘ 101 pupils. 
‘At Carlisle and Hampton the apprentices, in addition to the large amount of build- 
ing, repairing, and furnishing required by the 2 schools, manufactured 253 sets of double 
harness, 13 wagons and 1 buggy, 2,000 pairs of shoes, and 14,125 articles of tinware. 
The apprentices to the trades of blacksmith, carpenter, printer, shoemaker, tinsmith, 
wheelwright, painter, butcher, tailor, saddler, and baker were 183, while the rest of the 
boys were trained to farm work. During the summer vacation 106 boys and girls were 
placed in private families, with, it is said, the most satisfactory results. The first grad- 
uates from Carlisle, consisting of 37 Sioux from Dakota and 35 from tribes in the Indian 
Territory, returned to their homes in July, 1882. 
Industrial work at Forest Grove is said to have met with unusual success, the black- 
smith and shoe shop having netted to the school $772, while the carpenter apprentices 
put up additions to the buildings and made necessary repairs and furniture for the school 
rooms. Practical lessons in farming were given. Several of the boys were employed by 
farmers in harvest fields, where they received the same pay as white men. 
During the year 18 boarding school buildings have been opened for the first time 
among 36,517 Indians of different tribes, and 10 more were to be opened among other 
tribes in 1883. The Episcopalians have for many years maintained among the Yankton 
Indians a flourishing boarding school for boys. 
The whole number of Indian youth to be educated, exclusive of the Five Nations, is 
estimated at between 45,000 and 50,000. The cost of maintaining a youth at a reserva- 
tion boarding school is $150 a year; at a day school, $30. 
NORMAL AND SECONDARY TRAINING. 
In some of the more advanced schools of the Five Nations normal instruction is given. 
The seminaries of the Cherokees have normal departments. Hampton school had 30 In- 
dians in its normal classes. The Santee Normal Training School, Santee Agency, Nebr. 
(Congregational), St. Paul’s Boarding School, Yankton Reserve, Nebr. (Protestant Epis- 
copal), and several other schools under the same management give normal training to 
native teachers.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Educational affairs are managed by a territorial superintendent of public instruction, 
county superintendents, and district boards of 3 trustees. The first is biennially ap- 
pointed by the governor and confirmed by the upper branch of the territorial legislature; 
the others are chosen by the voters of their respective counties or districts, county offi- 
cers for 2 years, and district boards for 3, with an annual change of 1 member. 
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS. 
The schools are supported by money derived from a county tax of not less than 3 nor 
more than 5 mills on the dollar, from unlimited taxes voted by the districts, from various 
fines imposed by the courts, and from a fund arising from the sale of town lots previously 
reserved to provide for the erection and furnishing of'school buildings. The county tax and the amount derived from legal penalties are distributed to the districts in proportion to their population 4 to 21 (Indians not under the guardianship of white persons being excluded),
-P-A-G-E-593
MONTANA. 299 
provided the district has maintained school 3 months under a legally qualified teacher; 
that is, one who has obtained a county superintendent’s certificate, which may be of first, 
second, or third grade. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Though more fortunate than his brethren of the neighboring Territories in securing 
returns, the superintendent complains of the inaccurate and unintelligible way in which 
they are made up, and to remedy the evil he recommends that the reporting of statistics 
be made the business of the district clerk, with a penalty for the neglect of it. So far 
from being satisfied with the increase of 4 per cent. of enrolment on the population 4-21, 
the superintendent thinks that a compulsory law and reform schools would prove 
efficient instruments for increasing the small attendance. He urges the necessity of a 
high standard of qualification for teachers, a thing impossible of attainment under the 
present method of certification, and would have non-attendance on teachers’ institutes 
work a revocation of the delinquent’s certificate. 
The rate of taxation for the year was 3.7 mills, one-tenth of a mill less than the pre- 
ceding year, but, owing to the increased value of property, the decreased percentage 
yielded a larger amount than that obtained the year before. The average cost of the 
schools was also decreased from $3 a month per pupil to $2.45, notwithstanding an aver- 
age increase of $3.76 in the salaries of 191 teachers. 
Steps were being taken to prosecute two settlers who had located on the public school 
Jands or were removing timber from them. : 
CITY SYSTEM OF HELENA. 
STATISTICS. 
Although a school district and containing a population of only 3,624, the system of 
Helena is sufficiently advanced to warrant mention. Under a primcipal and 10 teachers 
the schools are all thoroughly graded and apparently thoroughly taught. Vocal music 
and drawing appear throughout the course and in the grammar grade there is the unusual 
feature of elementary Latin. In the 3 school buildings, which are valued at $40,000, 
were 600 sittings to accommodate a school population of 810 childrenyof whom 584 were 
enrolled, 424 in average belonging, and 390 in average daily attendance. The schools 
are furnished with chemical and philosophical apparatus and with the usual appliances 
of a well appointed school room, while to aid the teacher the library is supplied with 
educational works and current periodicals. The high school enrolled 41, graduating 1.

NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The only information received concerning instruction of this kind relates to the nor- 
mal course of the Helena high school, and no mention is made of pupils pursuing it. 
INSTITUTES. 
During the year county institutes were held in Deer Lodge and Lewis and Clarke 
Counties, both well attended and satisfactory, many well written papers being read and 
earnestly discussed. The superintendent complains that neither the law nor his appeals, 
with afew exceptions, have been of any avail in overcoming the indifference of county 
superintendents regarding institutes, and that when institutes are called the teachers who 
need them most invariably stay away. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. s 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
  Although high schools are a part of the system, that at Helena is the only one of 
which information has been received. The academic courses are scientific and classical, 
each of 4 years.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
Whatever general officers the Territory of New Mexico may have provided for the 
schools that it maintains, their duties can be of little importance, since the ‘‘sole and 
entire management, supervision, and control” of the schools are vested in a county board 
of supervisors and directors composed of 4 members; one of these is the county probate 
judge ex officio, and the others, elected biennially by the people, must be 5-year resi- 
dents, heads of families, and owners of real estate. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
There is no school tax levied as such, but from the general tax of 1 per cent. one-fourth 
is reserved for educational purposes and, with a poll tax of $1, is retained in the county 
treasury to be disbursed at the option of the supervising and directing board. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
Education in New Mexico is by no means flourishing. The inhabitants seem to be 
divided into two hostile parties, the larger of which, composed of the older and Mexican 
element of the population, desires to perpetuate the existing state of things; the other 
party demands reform, and not only wants the schools relieved from direct ecclesiastical 
control, but made non-sectarian. The reforms advocated have thus far made little 
Treadway. 
As this Territory has no superintendent, reports no statistics, in fact has no territorial 
system, it is impossible to do more than note the unsatisfactory condition in which its 
public educational affairs are and probably will for some time continue to remain. 
Five private institutions for secondary instruction report for the year, the statistics of 
which may be found in Table VI of the appendix.

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
A territorial superintendent of district schools, elected for 2 years, has general chargo 
of public school affairs. The local officers are county superintendents, elected by the 
people for 2 years, and district school trustees, elected for 3 years, with provision for an- 
nual change of one. There are also boards for the examination of teachers, comprising 3 
members appointed by the county courts. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools are supported from a tax of 3 mills on $1 of ordinary taxable property, 
from taxation of railroads, saleof estrays, and a special district tax not to exceed 2 per 
cent. a year. The funds provided by the Territory are disbursed by the superintendent 
in proportion: to the number of children 6 to 18 years of age, according to the annual 
reports of county superintendents. These officers must visit the schools at least twice 
in each year, examine the records of trustees, audit their accounts, and see that they are 
diligent in the discharge of their duties. They must keep accounts with the county treas- 
urers and embody a full statement thereof in their annual reports to the territorial super- 
intendent. District trustees must visit each school in their district at least once during 
each term, musttake an annual census of the youth 6 to18, and make report to the county 
superintendent, stating the condition of the schools. All failing to make such report 
are liable to prosecution on their bonds for neglect of duty, the amount recovered to go to 
the benefit of district schools. Teachers must report to the trustees at the close of each 
term. ‘The territorial and county superintendents decide what text books are to be 
used in the public: schools, the’ territorial superintendent’ appointing a convention for 
this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-597
  UTAH. 3803 
GENERAL“ CONDITION. 
The statistics show an increase of 950 in youth of school age and of 444 in the number 
enrolled in public schools, but a decrease of over a thousand in average daily attend- 
ance. The estimated value of public school property was reported $98,724 less than for 
the previous year, the receipts and expenditures for public schools also showing consid- 
erable decrease. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT. 
The principal provision in this Territory for the training of teachers is made in the 
normal department of the University of Deseret. The university receives $5,000 each 
year from the Territory to defray the expenses of 40 normal pupils for tuition, books, 
and use of apparatus, the incumbents being selected annually by the territorial superin- 
tendent from persons nominated by the boards of examination of the several counties. 
The course of study extends over 1 year, and students completing it receive certifi- 
cates which authorize them to teach in the common schools of the Territory without 
further examination. There were 41 normal pupils in attendance during the year and 
16 graduates are reported. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
No information has come to hand in regard to the normal institutes held during the 
year. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
There is no information regarding any public high schools in this Territory other than 
the academic department of the University of Deseret. 
ACADEMIES AND SEMINARIES.

SUPERIOR, SCIENTIFIC, AND PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
UNIVERSITY OF DESERET. 
The University of Deseret is the only institution for superior instruction reporting, 
and this is’a college only in name, its students being all academic and normal. The 
number in attendance during 1881—’82 was 193, of whom 85 were young women.— (Re- 
turn.) 
There are no institutions for scientific or professional instruction.

. TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The chief school officers are a territorial superintendent of public instruction, ap- 
pointed for 2 years by the governor and confirmed by the legislature, and a territorial 
board of education, composed of the superintendent and one person from each judicial 
district, appointed by the governor for 2 years. County officers are superintendents, 
elected by the people for 2 years, and boards of examination for teachers, comprising the 
county superintendent and 2 teachers chosen by him, who must be holders of the highest 
grade of certificate. District school affairs are in the hands of a board of 3 directors 
elected for 3 years, one being changed each year, and a district clerk. Women are eli- 
gible to school offices and may vote at school meetings. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
Public schools must be taught by qualified teachers at least 3 months during the year; 
the schools must teach the common English branches in the English language and be 
open free to all residents 5 to 21 yearsold. Attention must be given to the cultivation of 
manners and morals, to the laws of health, physical exercise of the pupils, and to the venti- 
lation and temperature of the school room. Teachers must keep a register and make an 
annual report to the county superintendent or forfeit the last month’s pay. In orderto 
be paid from public money they-mustthold? certificates *from‘the county or territorial

board of examination:i* The territorial board; grants certificates good for 3-years; the 
county board, those of 3 grades, good for 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. County super- 
intendents must report annually to the territorial: superintendent, failing in which they 
forfeit $100 of salary. District clerks must take!an annual census’ of the school pop 
ulation and report to the county superintendent. If any clerk fail to take such cen- 
sus he is individually liable to the district for the loss of the apportionment which 
it would otherwise have received. The schools are supported from the income of a 
public school fund, an annual tax on property of not less than 3 nor more than 6 mills 
on the dollar, and the proceeds of certain fines and penalties, all to be apportioned ac- 
cording to the number 4 to 21 years old. District taxes may be raised to furnish addi- 
tional school facilities at the will of the qualified voters of the district, but they must 
not exceed 10 mills on the dollar, except in incorporated cities or towns. 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The superintendent of public instruction calls attention to the prosperous condition 
of the schools throughout the Territory and says school districts and school-houses have 
increased in proportion to the vast increase of population, that a better class of school 
buildings was reported in the Territory than at any time in its past history, that there 
had also been a steadily increasing demand for better teachers, and that a great im- 
provement in that direction had been made. 
In 1881 the law was so amended as not to require county superintendents to hold in- 
stitutes and no longer made it the duty of teachers to attend. .This has had a bad 
effect on institute work, and the territorial superintendent recommends that the law be 
again amended so as to require county superintendents of counties having 10 or more 
organized districts to hold at least once a year a teachers’ institute, requiring all teachers 
to attend. There were 15 graded schools in the Territory; no other statistics were fur- 
nished for 1882. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT-OF WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. 
The normal department of the University of Washington Territory, Seattle, offers a 
3-year course of normal instruction, including the higher English branches and methods 
of teaching. There were 23 students in this department and 53 in the training school. 
OTHER NORMAL TRAINING. 
Whitman College and Seminary, Walla Walla, presents a 2-year normal course in the 
higher branches of study, with 1 year of preparatory training. Thorough preparation 
is given in both institutions for teaching in the public schools, and diplomas are con- 
ferred on the completion of the courses. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS AND OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
No definite information is at hand in regard to public high schools. 
For statistics of private academic schools reporting, see Table VI of the appendix, and 
for a summary, the report of the Commissioner preceding. 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN. 
‘The University of Washington Territory, Seattle, and Whitman College and Seminary, 
Walla Walla, open alike to both sexes, offered 4-year classical and 3-year scientific 
courses. The university gives a full 3-year commercial course, and in the departments 
of music and art are taught vocal and instrumental music, painting in oil and water 
colors, crayon work, freehand drawing, and sketching from nature. .. Both institutions 
required a preliminary examination for admission to any department and conferred ap- ~ 
propriate degrees at the completion of each course. : me et

TERRITORIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
OFFICERS. 
The territorial librarian continued to be ex officio superintendent of public instruction 
for the Territory. County superintendents are elected by the people every 2 years, and 
for each school district boards of 3 trustees are elected for 3 years, with annual change 
of one. 
OTHER FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM. 
.The public schools are sustained from a poll tax of $2 on each voter, from 2 mills 
on $1 of all taxable property, and from fines, penalties, and forfeitures. The people 
may at the annual district meeting vote such tax as they deem necessary to pay teach- 
ers, to purchase libraries, build or repair school-houses, and to procure fuel or books for 
poor children; the sum for a library is not to exceed $100 for any one year. In voting 
for school officers, in holding office, and in pay for teaching, no discrimination is made 
- between the sexes. Separate schools may be established for colored children when 
there are 15 or more in a district. A compulsory school Jaw requires parents or guar 
dians to send their children of school age to some public school at least 3 months in each 
year, or furnish satisfactory reason for absence, under penalty of a fine of $25... County 
superintendents and district directors may, in their discretion, establish schools of higher 
grade than the ordinary district school, the studies pursued to be determified by the 
Territorial Teachers’ Institute. This institute: must be heldzannually by the territo- 
rial superintendent of public instruction, with the county superintendents and princi- 
pals of graded schools; it is to continue not less than 4’ days’ nor more than 10. It 
must also decide upon the books and system of instruction to be used in the Territory.
-P-A-G-E-601
  WYOMING. 307 
GENERAL CONDITION. 
The system of public schools in the Territory is said to be one of the best. The ter- 
ritorial library had increased in the last two years 1,454 volumes, the present number 
being 6,667, exclusive of the public documents of the Territory. 
An association called ‘‘ The Wyoming Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters’? was 
organized during the year, having for its leading objects ‘‘ the encouragement of historical. 
and scientific research and the promotion of practical industries in Wyoming.” 
No statistics of schools are given for 1882, except for the city of Cheyenne, whose 
public school in 1871 enrolled 60 pupils, and in 1882, 500. The school is graded, and 
the course of study practical and thorough. There were 8 grades, with a 4-year course 
in the high school, which included the higher mathematics and classics, general history, 
English literature, political economy, and the natural sciences. A library belonging to 
the school numbered 500 volumes, largely representing the best writers. The school 
has a thorough system of discipline in all its departments, and the method of examina- 
tion at the end of each term is complete.

EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS. 
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF 
INSTRUCTION. 
PROCEEDINGS IN THE GENERAL MEETING. 
The fifty-third consecutive annual meeting of the American Institute and the twenty- 
first annual meeting of the National Educational Association were held conjointly at Sara- 
toga, July 11-14, 1882, the institute on the 11th and 13th and the association the 12th 
and 14th, with a joint meeting on the evening of the 14th. 
Hon. Gustavus J. Orr, president of the association, in his inaugural address referred 
to the great work before the educators of the country, and said that the proper solution 
of the educational question will not be reached until the whole subject of government shall 
be fully explored. The firstregular paper was on ‘‘The university: itsplace and workin 
the American system of education,’’ the next on “‘Self consciousness in education,’ 
both being ably discussed. Superintendent Patterson, of New Hampshire, advocated 
national aid and offered a resolution that a liberal appropriation on the basis of illiteracy 
be made from the National Treasury for the support of schools in the several States. A 
unanimous vote favored this. At the next session of the association ‘‘ Country schools” 
, and ‘‘The foundation principle of education by the state’ were the topics treated. The 
second day’s proceedings were taken up with the report of the president of the National 
Council of Education to the association (in which Mr. T. W. Bicknell gave its origin and 
objects), with papers on ‘‘Secularization of education,’’ ‘The prize system as an incen- 
tive to college students,’ and ‘‘ The Delsarte system of expression,’’ followed by memo- 
tials of members who died duringthe year. After the election of officers a joint meeting 
of the two bodies was held, in which five-minute addresses on educational topics were 
participated in by Messrs. Patterson, of New Hampshire; J. H. Carlisle, of Wofford 
College, 8. C.; Neil Gilmour, of New York; Henry Barnard; President Tappan, of Ken- 
yon College; G. A. Walton and C. C. Coffin, of Massachusetts.— (Proceedings and Ad- 
dresses of the National Educational Association.) 
DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER INSTRUCTION. 
On the afternoon of July 14 the only session of this branch of the association washeld. 
After the annual election of officers the following address was listened to: ‘‘The place 
of original research in a college education,’’ inwhich Prof. H. J. Wright, of Dartmouth, 
discussed the question from the German as well asthe American standpoint. Mr. Wright 
deplored the lack of power of independent and progressive intellectual activity in un- 
familiar fields of knowledge, found in our colleges. Hesuggested that the German semi- 
nary system would help much towards original research, as these undergraduate courses, 
with their association in work, awaken interest and enthusiasm, so that the workmanship, 
constantly subjected to severe and vigilant criticism, becomes finishedand mature. Scv- 
eral prominent educators discussed this subject. Prof. John W. Glenn, of Jefferson, Ga., 
then read an address on ‘‘Man the machine or man the inventor; which?’ He stated 
that the main duty of the primary schools is to awaken a consciousness of the creating 
energy and to develop the ability to use it. He further argued that that education is 
best which gives the broadest reach to the mental vision, and, arousing most perfectly 
the activities of intelligent will, links us most closely to the spiritual nature from which 
we emanated. The suggested topics in this address came up for discussion prior to the 
final adjournment. 
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
After the usual preliminaries the reading of papers was proceeded with. The topic 
“Dexterity before skill,”’ presented by Dr. George T. Fairchild, president Kansas State 
Agricultural College, led toa very animated discussion, Mr. Daniels, of Virginia, main- 
taining that in all schools teachers should be employed who could give instruction 
in manual training. Prof. C. M. Woodward, of Washington University, St. Louis, fol- 
lowed with ‘‘The function of a manual training school,’”’ in which he gave. the daily 
program of the St. Louis school, and, furthermore, stated that the aims of education 
are to teach language, literature, and mathematics, with a view to making each child 
a master of the art of verbal expression; to teach mechanical and free hand drawing with 
natural tints and with the conventions of shade and color, and aim at a mastery of the 
art of pictorial expression; and to teach the cunning fingers the wonderful power and 
use of tools, and aim at nothing less.than a mastery of the fundamental mechanical

  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. AND /CONVENTIONS. 309 
processes. To do all these things while the mind is gaining strength and clearness and 
materials for thought is the function of amanual training school. Prof. E. L. Youmans, 
in discussing this paper, referred to the need of this form of education for boys whose 
tastes do not lead them to purely intellectual pursuits. President White, of Purdue 
University, ably treated the subject of ‘‘The national industrial college: its history, 
work, and ethics,’”’ and Prof. S. R. Thompson, of Lincoln, Nebr., reported the progress 
of industrial education in 1881~’82. The election of officers closed the session. 
DEPARTMENT OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The first part of the session was occupied by the appointment of committees; then the 
president, C. C. Rounds, delivered an address on ‘‘ Needed changes in the organization 
and work of the normal school,’’ which led to the appointment of a committee to report 
at the next meeting on the proper organization and equipment of ‘a normal school. 
“The true place of the normal school in the educational system,’’ read by Hon. D. L. 
_Kiehle, State superintendent of Minnesota, was discussed by several gentlemen. The 
normals were maintained to be centres of reformatory influences ; the importance of giv- 
ing professional instructors to the mass of country common schools was emphasized; and 
the need of educating public sentiment to appreciate right teaching, so that the people 
may really know a good teacher, was dwelt upon. ‘The good result of teachers’ institutes 
in the South being next considered, the president of the department spoke of the earnest- 
ness of the pupils and the high character and ability of the instructors, saying that in 
this work the North had something to learn from the South. 
DEPARTMENT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
On the afternoon of the 14th, President John M. Bloss, of Indiana, called this de- 
partment to order, and, in his inaugural, referred to the problems to be solved in the 
department of primary education, suth as the discovery of the true teacher from among 
those who have attained the necessary scholarship and the recognition of the fact that 
the chief purpose of the primary school is to prepare the pupil for the exigencies of life, 
so that when he leaves the school he may become a useful citizen. In ‘‘‘The relation of 
memory to elementary education,’’ George P. Brown, president of the Indiana State 
Normal School, dwelt upon the difference between the mere verbal memory and the 
complete mastery of the subjects taught in the text books. He said that a rational 
study of a text book causes activities of soul in the student similar to those experienced 
by the original discoverer. He would not have less use of text books, but better use of 
‘them by better teachers. A paper by Miss Carrie B. Sharp, of Indiana, on ‘‘ What, 
how, and how better?’’ (on better methods of education, so as to cultivate real mental 
power), was discussed. Then, after the election of officers, the meeting adjourned. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
The second annual meeting of this body was held at Saratoga, commencing July 6, 
1882, and continuing by adjourned sessions until the close of the joint meetings of the 
National Educational Association and the American Institute of Instruction, on July 
14, At the first session the purposes and scope of the council were discussed by the 
members. © The report of the committee on pedagogics occupied two sessions of the coun- 
cil. The report of the committee on technical education in public schools, which was 
discussed at Atlanta in 1881, was ordered to be printed. ‘‘ High schools asa part of a 
system of publiceducation’”? waspresented in four papers, viz: (1) ‘‘ Theright of the high 
school to a place in the system,’’ in which J. L. Pickard, president of Iowa University, 
said that the high school exists from necessity; (2) ‘‘ The relation of the high school to 
the lower grade of schools,’’ in which it was argued that high schools are an incentive 
to pupils to push forward to higher attainments than can be secured in their own grades; 
(3) “‘ Its relation to business life, with the true course of its studies,’? which Dr. Mowry 
closed with a carefully prepared plan for an English high school course of studies; and 
(4) “‘ The relation of high schools to schools of technology,” in which C. O. Thompson, PH. 
D., of Massachusetts, said that ample general preparation, such as a high school gives, is 
requisite to prepare students for either schools of engineering or industrial schools. All 
these papers were thoroughly discussed. The committee on a graded course of in- 
struction for country schools reported through its chairman, Hon. J. W. Dickinson, of 
Massachusetts, showing that the ultimate end to be secured by all school exercises is the 
harmonious development of the faculties of the human mind. ‘‘The harmonizing of 
primary, secondary, and collegiate systems of education’’ was reported from the com- 
mittee on university and college education. The committee held that the unity of the 
great educational course requires that each stage should prepare pupils for the succeed- 
ing stage; the high schools should recognize the college as the last of the educational 
systems and arrange their work accordingly. If this idea of the unity of the educational 
process be conscientiously acted upon, any,wantof harmony must soon disappear. Some

amendments were made to the constitution and committees were announced, after which 
the council adjourned, to meet with the National Association in the week previous to its 
next annual meeting.— (Journal of Education. ) 
ANNUAL MEETING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE, 
A brief meeting of this department was held at Saratoga to elect officers and a mem- 
ber of the National Council of Education. The regular annual meeting was at Washing- 
ton, D. C., March 21-23, 1882. At the preliminary meeting the subject of national aid 
formed the basis of discussion, and on motion of General John Eaton the executive com- 
mittee was instructed ‘to select a committee on the subject of national aid, to prepare 
resolutions and present this matter in behalf of this association before a joint meeting 
of the congressional Committees on Educationand Labor.”? ‘The opening session,on March 
22, was devoted to papers on ‘‘'The information necessary to determine the merits of 
the heating and ventilation of a school building,’’ by Dr. John S. Billings, U.s. A.; on 
“The chemical examination of air as applied to questions of ventilation,” by Capt. 
Charles Smart, U. 8. A.; on ‘‘Obstaclesin the way of better primary education,” by Hon. 
H.S. Jones, PH. D., superintendent of schools, Erie, Pa.; and on ‘‘ Chairs of pedagogy in 
our higher institutions of learning,’’ by Prof. G. Stanley Hall, px. p., Cambridge, Mass. 
Dr. Billings, in his very able paper, spoke of the location and exposure of aschool build- 
ing as being of great importance in connection with its heating and ventilation, and 
called attention to the deficiencies in the various systems of heating because of the want 
of sufficient heating surface and the want of some means of control by which a free sup- 
ply of air may be permitted to enter the building without passing over the heating sur- 
face. He also urged that a committee be appointed to take into consideration the sub- 
ject of systematically recording the health of children and advised that it should suggest 
forms ofrecords. Dr. Smart gavean account of the amount of carbonic acid in the out- 
side air and in that of buildings, stating how the car onic acid determination is to be 
made and what information it farnishes regarding the ventilation of a school room or 
other apartment. The second session was devoted solely to a discussion of the subject 
of national aid to education, Rev. A. D. Mayo making the opening address. He was 
followed by Dexter A. Hawkins, A. M., of Newark, N. J., and by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, 
LL. D. At the nextsession the leading topic was ‘‘ The neglect of education in Alaska,”’ 
presented by Rev. Sheldon Jackson, in whose paper the state-of education before and 
after the purchase of that country was depicted at length and the need of aid from Con- 
gress impressed on the friends of education. Dr. W. W. Godding, superintendent 
of the Government Hospital for the Insane, read a paper dealing with mistakes in the 
education of the young as seen from his.standpoint. He says sufficient attention is not 
paid to the temperament of the child, and desires that the mental growth be natural 
without forcing, as the greatest danger to our civilization to-day lies in the direction of 
nervous exhaustion. Dr. J. M. Gregory, in ‘‘Some. fundamental inquiries concerning 
the common school studies,’’ challenged the propriety of devoting so much time to the 
seven studies which run all through the lower school years and suggested that the 
indispensable branches should be those which impart a knowledge of ourselves, physi- 
cal, mental, and moral, and of the world in which we live. At the fourth session reso- 
Tutions were adopted in regard to the death of promment educators. This was followed 
by a paper, sent by W. T. Harris, LL. p., on improving the qualifications of teach- 
ers, Which subject was afterwards discussed. Earlier in the session a resolution was 
adopted that the report of the commission on school buildings in the District of Colum- 
pia be furnished the department of superintendence for publication. Adjourned. 
NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The semiannual meeting was held in Boston, May 26, 1882, Col. F. W. Parker in the 
chair. The order of the day was the presentation and discussion of the subject of exam- 
inmations. First the purpose of examinations was taken up, Superintendent S. A. Bent 
saying that their primary object was to test the teacher, for, as the teacher so the class. 
Superintendent S. T. Dutton thought that too much stress might be laid upon the value of 
examinations as a test of teachers. Oral examinations were declared unsatisfactory by 
Superintendent M. L. Hawley, of Gloucester, while Superintendent C. Morrill, of Lowell, 
favored them as giving an insight into the child’s mind not obtainable by written ques- 
tions. Written examinations were discussed by Superintendents O. B. Bruce and E. A. 
Davis, the former maintaining that they compel original reasoning and serve as a stim- 
ulus and useful guide, the latter, though favoring them for certain purposes, arguing 
that their general tendency is to direct the ambition and energies of pupils toward ob- 
taining high percentages. Superintendents Kimball, of Newton, and Connell, of Fall 
River, spoke on the systems of marking required to show the child’s progress; with the

proper marking, examinations, which are too often mere belittling tests, become broad- 
ened and eleyated into a means of liberal culture. There was a general discussion of 
examinations as a basis of promotion. Superintendent Buck, of Manchester, N. H., 
did not favor the percentage examination as a necessary step for promotion, owing 
to the evils of nervousness, &c., engendered by this system, Superintendent Cogswell 
would dispense with uniform examinations and would pass the bright pupils as fast as 
they were ready, while Superintendent Seaver protested against all arbitrary numerical 
marking, as it could only be considered relatively. In conclusion Professor Tweed ex- 
plained one of the reasons why the marking system was introduced, namely, to allay 
suspicion of favoritism at a time when the high school was considered a peculiarly aris- 
tocratic institution. 
On October 27, 1882, about 35 of the New England superintendents met again in Bos- 
ton to discuss educational topics. The subjects of high school graduation exercises and 
school exhibitions came up, the discussion covering a broad range and bringing out all 
phases of the question.— (New-England Journal of Education.) 
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. 
This body held its sessions in Washington, D. C., commencing April 26, 1882. Many 
. of the leading scientists of the country were present. Papers were read on the ‘Course 
of the Gulf Stream since the Cretaceous period,’’ ‘‘Notes on the geology of Yucatan,” 
“Desiccation of the Plateau of Mexico,’’ and ‘‘On the young stages of a few osseous 
fishes ’’—all by Professor Alex. Agassiz. Other papers of general interest were “The rela- 
tion of rain areas to areas of low pressure,’’ by Elias Loomis; ‘‘ Preliminary notice of a 
new dividing engine,” by H. A. Rowland; on ‘‘Photographs of the spectrum of the 
nebula in Orion,” by Henry Draper; ‘‘Theory of concave gratings,’’ by H. A. Rowland; 
on ‘‘The results of the incandescent lamp tests at the Paris Exhibition,” by G. F. 
Barker; ‘‘Note on a special form of secondary battery or electric accumulator,’ by Wol- 
cott Gibbs; and ‘‘Some discoveries, that enhance the value of the cotton and orange 
crops,” by C. V. Riley.— (Industrial News.) 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-third meeting of this association was convened at St. Paul, Minn., on June 
6, 1882, and continued in session four days. After the usual address of welcome the 
question of professional ethics was agitated, the secretary announcing that numerous 
communications had been received protesting against the admission of delegates from the 
New York Medical Society and condemning its course in reference to the code of ethics. 
In the annual address First Vice-President Dr. Hooper also referred to the action of the 
New York Medical Society, and insisted that the broad line of demarcation between the 
irregular and the true physician should never be obliterated. In the section on medical 
practice the subjects presented were ‘‘Therapeutic action of chlorate of potassium,” 
‘Home treatment of pulmonary consumption by general local antisepsis on the basis of 
strict individualization,’’ and “‘'The use of salicylate of potassa in acute rheumatism and. 
dyspepsia.’’ They were fully discussed. Dr. A. L. Gihon, chairman of the section on 
State medicine, gave one of the most notable papers of the entire session. In this he 
laid great stress on making physicians alive to their responsibilities as sanitary guides, 
on encouraging the formation and development of State boards of health, and through 
these influencing the legislation of the country to recognize the practical sanitary needs 
of this advanced age. In the section on surgery and anatomy several papers of interest 
were presented. One on ‘‘ Anchylosis of the hip’? was discussed at length. In the sec- 
tion on ophthalmology, otology, and laryngology the matter of communicable diseases 
of the eye received considerable attention. A resolution was adopted that every second 
meeting be held in Washington. The association adjourned to meet in Cleveland in 
q une, Sal (Buffalo Medical and Surgical Journal and Boston Medical and Surgical 
ournal. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR SANITARY AND RURAL IMPROVEMENT, 
» On July 7-10, 1882, this body met at Greenwood Lake, New York. The secretary, 
C. F. Wingate, of Brooklyn, spoke of the need of sanitary associations and gave a review 
of such organizations in the United States and Great Britain. F. B. Hough, of Wash- 
ington, D. C., advocated the planting of trees as a preventive of malaria and a security 
against drought. Papers were read in relation to the adornment and sanitary surround- 
ings of farmers’ homes; in condemnation of wall papers containing arsenic; on dust and 
the forms of disease resulting from its effects on the human, system. » On the second day 
sewerage and the causes and remedies of malaria were the topics treated. «A paper by

Frederick Law Olmstead on the economy of park organizations and the necessity of tree- 
planting was discussed. Tenement house reform, the necessity of teaching sanitary sci- 
ence in the public schools, and unsanitary cookery filled the remainder of the session. 
The committee on organization desired that the association should disseminate its prin- 
ciples by the formation of local organizations and the issuing of pamphlets and other pub- 
lications. The election of officersfollowed. Adjourned.— (Boston Medical and Surgical 
Journal.) 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. 
The thirty-first annual meeting took place at Montreal the last week of August, 
1882. The sessions were characterized as unusually successful, owing to:the number of 
members and distinguished scientists from abroad who were present, as well as to the 
number of papers presented (256) and the variety of excursions and entertainments 
planned by the Canadian hosts. The president, Principal J. W. Dawson, F. R. 8., of 
MeGill College, in his opening address spoke of the increase in membership since the 
previous meeting at Montreal, 25 years before, then 400 members, now 2,000, and of the 
increase in sections. In 1857 there were two sections and a subsection; now nine sec- 
tions meet simultaneously. A list of deceased members for the year was read; over 169 
applicants were elected members, among them the English and European scientists 
present; and the meeting resolved itself into the various sections. In the evening of the 
first day, Prof. J. G. Brush, of Yale College, the retiring president, addressed the body 
on ‘‘Mineralogy,”’ instead of reviewing the progress of science during the year, as has 
heretofore been the custom. In section A—mathematics and astronomy — Prof. J. R. 
Eastman read Professor Harkness’s paper on the transits of Venus, and Dr. Houghton, of 
Dublin, gave a radical paper on ‘‘ New views of Mr. George H. Darwin’s theory of the 
evolution of the earth-moon system, considered as to its bearing on the question of the 
duration of geological time.”? In opposition to Sir Wm. Thomson and others, the doc- 
tor doubted whether the earth or any other planet ever existed in a fluid condition. In 
section B— physics — Vice-President T. C. Mendenhall spoke of the necessity of spread- 
ing an elementary knowledge of physics among-educated people in general, and Prof. A. 
Graham Bell read a paper on the electrical experiments to determine the location of the 
bullet in the body of President Garfield. He also brought before the section a proposed 
method of producing artificial respiration by means of a vacuum jacket. Chemical lit- 
erature and laboratory appliances were treated by Dr. C. Bolton and Mr. E. H. Cookin 
the chemistry section. Numerous technical papers were presented in the section of me- 
chanical science. Among them ‘‘ The permeability of the linings of house walls to air,” 
in which Mr. T. H. Baker advocated the old fashioned whitewashed walls, because, 
hygienically considered, walls should be porous, and wall papers rendered them nearly 
air tight. In section E—geology and geography—E. Orton, of Ohio, discussed ‘* A 
source of the bituminous matter in the Ohio black shale,”” and Dr. John Rae described 
the various land expeditions undertaken for the exploration of the country between 
Hudson’s Bay and the Arctic Ocean, off the Mackenzie River. Prof. Wm. H. Dall, in 
the biological section, reviewed the progress of knowledge about the American mollusks. 
Prof. T. Mehan, State botanist of Pennsylvania, gave his impressions as to variations in 
nature from his experience in regard to the origin of species. Hethought the Darwinian 
theory could notbecontroverted. Professor Ward, in ‘Classification of organisms,’’ tended 
to show that organic life results from aggregations of matter. In section G—histology 
and microscopy —the vice president described the progress this section had made since 
its inception in 1869. Vegetable poisons were practically treated by Prof. J. S. Burrill, 
of Illinois Industrial University, and ‘‘The bacillus of tuberculosis ’’ was discussed by 
Professor Osler. A scheme of anthropology was presented by Professor Mason in the 
anthropology section. This paper was to help anthropologists to classify their mate- 
rial. H. Hale Clinton, of Ontario, answered the question ‘‘ Have the Indians come from 
Europe?’ in the affirmative. In section I—economic science and statistics —the ses- 
sion opened with the usual address by the vice president, E. B. Elliot. He next 
spoke on international standard time, which subject was fully discussed. Other tech- 
nical papers were read. In the general department Dr. W. B. Carper gave an inter- 
‘ ting lecture on deep-sea temperature and Prof. A. Graham Bell illustrated his system 
a my) speech.— (Journal of Educ:ition and Kansas City Review of Science and In- 
lustry. 
NATIONALSEDUCATION ASSEMBLY. 
The first annual meeting of this'body took place at Ocean Grove, N. J., August 8-9, 
1882. This was said to be a meeting of more than ordinary significance, as the majority 
of the States and Territories were represented by eminent men engaged in or deeply in- 
terested in the subject of popular education. . The opinion was universally expressed
-P-A-G-E-607
  ‘EDUCATIONAL :ASSOCIATIONS. AND CONVENTIONS. 813 
that the illiterate masses need aid and that the.National Government should give it. A 
practical result of this meeting was the organization of a national education committee 
to urge on Congress the need of annual aid to supplement the work of the public schools 
of the various States and Territories, so that illiteracy may be overcome. Letters were 
read from many prominent men indorsing the object of the meeting. The Commissioner 
of Education, General John Eaton, gave a stirring address on ‘‘ The nation the only ade- 
quate patron of education,’’ and Dr. H. R. Waite, one on ‘‘ The relations of illiteracy to 
suffrage.’’ . General James F. Rusling, of Trenton, spoke on the education necessary to the 
state, and others on the philosophy of education and on the illiteracy of the white 
people of the South. The evening session was devoted to education in Alaska and the 
training of Indians. On the second day the education of the colored people, the rela- 
tion of education to the church, and national aid for illiteracy were taken up. Senator 
Blair earnestly advocated such aid as will stimulate home effort. Resolutions were 
adopted in favor of presenting a memorial to Congress in regard to the need of aid from 
the nation. A constitution for permanent organization was presented and adopted. A 
letter in regard to the objects of the meeting, from Hon. H. M. Teller, Secretary of 
the Interior, was read, and after the usual transaction of business the meeting ad- 
journed.— (New-England Journal of Education.) : 
AMERICAN INSTRUCTORS OF THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The tenth annual meeting was held at the Illinois Institution for the Instruction of the 
Deaf and Dumb, Jacksonville, August 26-30, 1882, Dr. E. M. Gallaudet presiding. 
Nearly all the papers bore upon living questions, and the discussions which followed them 
were pertinent and suggestive. Although the question of articulation came up, less time 
was given toit thanat any other recent conference of instructorsof the deaf. Thepapers 
covered such subjects as the religious education of deaf-mutes, what deaf-mute instruction 
in the United States owes to the American Asylum and its early instructors, the physical 
training of deaf-mutes, the value of experience in our school work, the Grube method of 
teaching arithmetic, the mental life of deaf-mutes as related to their education and care, 
deaf-mute education in Minnesota, the preparation of advanced pupils for colleges, the 
necessity of a more systematic instruction, institution libraries, compulsory education, 
&c. . Many of these papers were freely discussed. After the reading of obituary notices 
and the usual business arrangements the association adjourned.— (Annals of the Deaf 
and Dumb and report of the proceedings. ) 
AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The fourteenth annual session of this association was held at Cambridge July 11-13, 
1882, the president, Prof. F. D. Allen, of Cambridge, in the chair. The secretary 
reported the association in a better financial condition than ever before. The report of 
the committee, which, in conjunction with a committee of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science, presented a memorial to 430 colleges, asking them to abstain 
wholly from conferring degrees honoris causa, was accepted and the committee continued. 
In the afternoon session papers were read by Prof. J. B. Sewall, of Braintree, on “‘ Pecul- 
iarities of the letters as they appear in early colonial records;’? by Prof. C. H. Toy, of 
Harvard, on “‘ Semitic personal pronouns;”? and by Prof. William D. Whitney, of Yale, 
on ‘‘ Further words as to surds and sonants’? and on ‘‘ The law of economy.”? At the 
evening session President Allen read his annual address, which was on ‘‘ The influence 
of the University of Leyden upon modern philology.”’? On the following morning Prof. 
F, A. March, professor of Anglo-Saxon in Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, read a paper 
on the early poem of “‘Beéwulf,’? which he represented as the picture of a singular 
world. Its characters are strange to us, the action goes on in the midst of a strange 
nature; some explanation of its strangeness was reached in examining the manner in 
which its effects on the different senses are presented. ‘The next paper was by Prof. A. 
C. Merriam, of Columbia College, on ‘‘Alien intrusion between article and noun,” in 
which he stated that in most languages only attributive words or phrases are admitted 
between the article and its noun, but the Greck admits alien words and clauses of alt 
kinds, with the exception of the particles, under the strict application of the law that 
an attributive must also be present and precede the alien element. Rev. J. Colver 
Wightman followed with a paper on ‘‘ The form and significance of the aorist tense in 
Greek.’? Other papers for the day were on the quantity of Latin prosody, the influence 
of Latin syntax on Anglo-Saxon gospels, the use of the phrases “ two first”’ and ‘‘first 
two,” and a discussion of surds and sonants. ‘The last day was devoted to papers on ‘‘ oi 
# 4 with the future prohibitive,” ‘‘ Cyclops,’”’ and “The smile of Aphrodite,” ‘‘Ini- 
tial P in Gothic and Anglo-Saxon,” and ‘Indo-European case system.”? The society

pledged itself once more to the cause of bettering English spelling, in which it is sup- 
ported by the spelling reform associations of this country and Great Britain.— (Boston 
Daily Advertiser. ) . 
SPELLING REFORM ASSOCIATION. 
The sixth annual meeting of the Spelling Reform Association was held at Harvard 
University, commencing on July 13. ‘The annual reports and letters afforded much en- 
couragement to the members present, showing as they did a deepening interest in the 
reform. The most important work of the meeting was the adoption of a form of pledge 
proposed by the secretary and after full discussion adopted by unanimous vote. This 
form covered the following simplified spellings: to use the forms program, favor, &c.; 
tho, thru, gard, catalog, ar, giv, definit, &c.; f for ph, t for d or ed final when sounded 
as t; drop silent e after a short vowel; when a word ends with a double letter omit the 
last; use all changes recommended by the American Philological Association; use com- 
plete phonetic spelling. A choice was given to the signers to declare in favor of any 
of the above rules. Each person signing the pledge writes after his name the number of 
the regulations which he intends to follow, to indicate how far he intends to carry out the 
reform. The action of the Philological Association in pledging itself to the cause of Eng- 
lish reform spelling did much to encourage the reformers. ‘The officers for the ensuing 
year were chosen and the meeting adjourned.— (New-England Journal of Education.) 
AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION. 
The association was called to order at Saratoga, September 4, 1882, by the president, 
Dr. Francis Wayland, of Yale College, who in his opening address stated that the public 
mind is disposed as never before to consider the problems of social phenomena with fear- 
less independence. Thesecretary, F'. B. Sanborn, presented his yearly report, which con- 
tained a statement of some general considerations and special conditions that make it 
incumbent on the members of the association to maintain the study of social science in 
America and which encourage them to think that their studies and labors in former 
years have not been altogether in vain. On September 5, Dr. W. T. Harris discussed the 
subject of education in its broadest signification. Miss Alice Fletcher presented an ab- 
stract of a paper on ‘‘Civilization of American Indians’ and Dr, H. L. Wayland oneon 
progressive spelling. Both of these papers were fully discussed. The evening lecture 
was by Rev. A. D. Mayo, on “State aid to education.”” He was followed by Professor Gold- 
win Smith, who spoke briefly on state aid given to education in England and France. He 
deprecated interference by the General Governmentin local affairs. Dr. W.T. Harrisin 
reply maintained that under the pending bill in aid of education there need be no fears 
of interference. On September 6, Dr. Walter Channing, of Boston, spoke on boards of 
health, and Dr. Henry Baker, secretary of the Michigan board of health, continued the 
subject. Dr. A. N. Blodgett followed with a paper on the management of chronic ine- 
briates and insane drunkards, which paper was discussed by Professor Wayland, Judge A. 
P. Peaboily, and Rev. 1.8. Prime. Dr. E. M. Hunt, of the New Jersey board of health, 
and Dr. D. F. Lincoln presented papers on sanitation. Afterthe election of officers Miss 
Clara Barton read :a paper on ‘‘ Relief associations.’ The opening paper on the follow- 
ing day was by T. Bacon, of Rochester, N. Y., on ‘‘ Professional ethies,’’ which was 
briefly discussed in the affirmative. Disfranchisement for crime was treated by Messrs. 
James F. Colby, of New Haven, and Carroll D. Wright, chief of the Massachusetts bu- 
reau_ of statistics. .A paper on “Local government in the West”’ was read by Mr. Ed- 
ward W. Bemis, of Springfield, Mass., and Rev. Washington Gladden, of the same city, 
closed the day with an interestingpaper.on ‘‘Unsocial forees.’? The last day, Septem- 
. ber 8, was mainly devoted to reports on factories.— (Journal of Education.)

awakens the observing pow- ers, and imparts dexterity to the hand; also power to ana- 
lyze and synthetize, and to 
give expression to thought. Promotes general health, and 
awakens the mental facul- 
ties naturally, bringin Knowledge in a connecte 
form before the mind. 
Teaches the child to recognize 
and to respect the rights of 
others, to be courteous and 
kind to his elders, makes 
him thoughtful about the 
most common objects, thus 
increasing his own powers of happiness and usefulness to others. 
Good, both physically and mentally. 
Promotes physical health, 
mickens the faculties, cul- 
tivates habits of neatness, 
cleanliness, industry, and 
kindness; and these refining influences extend even tothe 
parents. .| Most excellent in every re- spect.

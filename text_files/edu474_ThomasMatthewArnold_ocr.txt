INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
+ In the Catalogue of the British Museum Library, there 
are no less than eighty-nine entries under the name of 
Matthew Arnold, and sixty-seven under that of his 
father. These entries include references to each of 
the several editions of their published works, whether 
books or pamphlets, and also to numerous tracts and 
essays containing criticism or comment upon those 
works. They do not, however, include the large num- 
ber of reviews and articles which occur in the periodi- 
cals and dictionaries of the time, and which throw 
light on the character and achievements of the Arnolds. 
Of the abundant literature with which their names 
have thus come to be associated, much is occupied 
with ephemeral controversy, and with incidents little 
likely to interest the coming generation of readers 
or indeed to be wholly intelligible to them. It has 
seemed to me, therefore, that as both men have ex- 
erted a large share of influence in forming the opinion 
of the country on educational questions, and as their 
lives possess peculiar interest for those who are 
teachers by profession, there was room for a small 
volume which, without professing to furnish a new 
biography, or a new theory respecting either writer, 
should essay the modest task of bringing together such 
of the teaching of both as was most likely to prove of

permanent value, and also to explain and justify the 
honourable position the Arnolds occupy in the history 
of public education in England and in the grateful 
memory of her teachers. I can claim no higher quali- 
fication for this duty than is implied in the facts that 
I have learned some of the best lessons of my life 
from the study of these authors; that as a colleague 
in the Education Department I had many opportuni- 
ties of knowing Matthew Arnold’s views and estimat- 
ing his personal influence; and that, although for 
different reasons, I have a genuine admiration for 
both father and son.

Tuomas Arnotp has had the good fortune to be 
the subject of one of the best biographies in our 
language. In the history of English literature, when 
one comes to enumerate the most notable biographies 
which have been produced, it will be found that the 
number of such books entitled to the highest rank 
as works of art is not large. It is easy to record 
the dates and parentage, the public employments, the 
events and movements of a man’s outward life, to 
give a selection from his letters and to add a critical 
account of his principal writings. But it is not easy 
to present a true portraiture of the hero’s character, 
to acquire a keen insight into the motive forces of 
his life, to distinguish the significant from the insig- 
nificant, the typical from the exceptional incidents 
in his career, to look at him from without, and 
also to understand him from within, and to know 
B 1

with what eyes he saw the world around him, and 
in what spirit he encountered the problems it pre- 
sented. “I have remarked,” says Carlyle, “that 
a true delineation of the smallest man, and his 
scene of pilgrimage through life, is capable of 
interesting the greatest man; and that all men are 
to an unspeakable degree brothers, each man’s life 
a strange emblem of every man’s, and that human 
portraits faithfully drawn are of all pictures the 
welcomest on human walls.”! Of English books 
which have best fulfilled these conditions Bacon’s 
Henry VII., Walton’s Lives, Johnson’s Lives, Bos- 
well’s Johnson, Carlyle’s Life of Sterling, Tre- 
velyan’s Life of Macaulay, Mr. John Morley’s 
Rousseau and Walpole are among the best. But 
Dean Stanley’s Life and Correspondence of Dr. Arnold 
will ever be entitled to a high rank, not only for the 
vividness of its presentation of a striking character 
and the circumstances of a life, but also for the 
skill with which relevant and irrelevant facts are 
discriminated, and for the profound sympathy of the 
author with its subject. The book will long remain 
to the student of the social, religious, and political 
history of the former half of the nineteenth century 
a treasury of valuable material, because it portrays in 
clear outline a central figure round which clustered 
some of the most remarkable personages and inci- 
dents of a stirring and eventful period. Stanley’s 
book is a large one and deals necessarily with much 
ephemeral controversy, religious and political, which

  STANLEY’S LIFE OF ARNOLD 3 
may possibly not excite any strong interest in the 
present generation of readers. It is to be feared that 
these facts may have the effect of concealing from 
those readers much that is of permanent value in 
Arnold’s history and performance. A smaller volume, 
The Life of Dr. Arnold, by Miss Emma J. Worboise, 
is also distinguished by care and sympathy, by a 
reverent and yet candid estimate of character, and 
especially by the emphasis with which she dwells 
on the religious side of Arnold’s nature and influ- 
ence. It is not in the vain hope of adding new 
material to the story which has twice been so well 
told, or with a view to present any new theory by 
which to interpret the significance of Arnold’s 
career, that the present book is written, but simply 
in order to bring into special prominence those 
features of his own character and that of his more 
gifted son Matthew, which possess special interest 
and are likely to be of permanent value to the pro- 
fessional teacher.

the University until 1820 at work as a tutor, hayin: 
been ordained two years earlier. He then left 
Oxford and_took a curacy at Laleham_in Surveys 
married Mary Penrose, and during the next eight 
years was chiefly occupied in historical studies and 
/ ko-o in preparing private pupils for the University. In 
1828 he accepted the Head-Mastership of Rugby 
School, and continued in that.post until his sudden 
th_in 1842. 
Of the influences which contributed to shape his 
character in early life, perhaps the most potent, next 
to those of a happy, intelligent, well-ordered home, 
were the political and military events which at a 
crisis of extraordinary interest in English history, 
were well calculated to fire the imagination and call 
forth the latent patriotism of a young boy. He was 
but a little child when Pitt was at the zenith of his 
power, and 
      
    “Launched that thunderbolt of war 
On Egypt, Hafnia, Trafalgar,” 
when Nelson’s victories filled all English hearts with 
exultation, when the name of Buonaparte was so asso- 
ad:
-P-A-G-E-17
EARLY TRAINING 5 
ciated with terror and alarm that nurses used to 
frighten children with the threat that he was com- 
ing; and when every gazette brought exciting news 
of battle by field or at sea. The news of Trafalgar 
to a boy of ten, and of Corunna four years later, 
and the succession of peninsular victories ending at 
Vittoria in 1813, could not fail to make an enduring 
impression on the mind of an open-hearted, thought- 
ful lad, habitually predisposed to look upon human 
history rather as the scene of action and of noble 
endeavour than in any other light. 
Years after, he looked back and counted his early 
experience of ships and warfare as among the forma- 
tive influences of his life. “More than half my 
boys,” he said in 1829, “never saw the sea and never 
were in London, and it is surprising how the first of 
these disadvantages interferes with their understand- 
ing much of the ancient poetry. Brought up myself 
in the Isle of Wight, amidst the bustle of soldiers 
and sailors, and familiar from a child with boats and 
ships and the flags of half Europe, which gave me 
an instinctive acquaintance with geography, I quite 
marvel to find in what a state of ignorance boys are 
at seventeen or eighteen who have lived all their days 
in inland parishes or small country towns.” ? 
To such experience, and to the events of the great 
war, may be attributed the zest with which he after- 
wards described the wars of Greece and of Rome, 
the keen interest with which he traced with Livy the 
march of Hannibal over the Alps, or described the 
1 Letter XII.

battle of Agospotamos or Salamis. Down to the time 
when he went to Oxford, all English politics were 
warlike. Great questions of domestic politics, such 
as the emancipation of the Catholics, and social and 
electoral reform, were for the time in abeyance, or 
they would probably have had, even at that early 
date, profound interest for him. If the combative 
instinct was strongly manifest in him through life, 
so that it is hardly too much to say that in one sense 
he was a “man of war from his youth,” the fact may 
be partly ascribed to the fierce national rivalries and 
contests in the midst of which his childhood was 
passed, and to the strong impulse which those con- 
tests gave to his youthful patriotism. 
Nor could the changed aspect of the literary hori- 
zon be without its influence on a young boy who was 
from the first a voracious reader, as sensitive to the 
intellectual as to the political movements of his 
time. The taste for the classical poetry of Pope and 
Dryden had declined; Cowper, Thomson, and Crabbe 
had sought the subjects of their verse in the incidents 
of familiar life, had evinced a keener sense of the 
beauties of outward nature, had revolted against 
established tradition, and had prepared the way for 
a revival of the healthy romanticism, which was begin- 
ning to find a fuller expression in Coleridge, Scott, 
Wordsworth, and Southey, and was afterwards to 
achieve some of its greatest triumphs in Tennyson 
and Browning. But although ballad poetry and 
Pope’s Homer had ever a certain fascination for him, 
chiefly because of the incidental light it threw on his-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
BOOKS AND STUDIES 7 
tory, it was not from the poets, ancient or modern, that 
he derived the main inspiration of his life. History 
and political philosophy always had stronger attrac- 
tions for him. Gibbon and Burke, Mitford, Russell, 
and Priestley, Thucydides and Livy, Herodotus and 
Xenophon, were eagerly read by him at a very early 
age, and had a larger share than tragedians or poets 
in the direction of his aims and the formation of his 
tastes and character. “Every man,” says Coleridge, 
“is born an Aristotelian or a Platonist. The one 
considers reason a quality or attribute, the other con- 
siders it a power.” We may well hesitate to accept 
Coleridge’s rough classification of mankind as ex- 
haustive; but in so far as the distinction on which 
he insists is real, it is well illustrated in Arnold’s 
mind and character. He was Aristotelian, mainly in 
the sense in which he sought to make all speculative 
enquiry subservient to the solution of practical prob- 
lems. To the last he had a peculiar reverence and 
affection for the “dear old Stagyrite,” and when the 
time came for him to send his sons to the University, 
he was led to prefer Oxford, because there Aristotle 
was held in higher esteem and was more likely to 
be well studied than at the sister University. The 
parent of science, properly so called, the master of 
criticism, and in one sense the founder of formal 
logic, Aristotle was to Arnold something more than 
all this ; he was the guide to right methods of study, 
the seer who beheld the larger problems of life, of 
society, and of polity in their true perspective, and the 
intrepid and earnest seeker after truth. Mr. Justice 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  
8 THOMAS ARNOLD 
Coleridge, in his interesting reminiscences of Arnold 
as an undergraduate at Corpus, remarks, “He was so 
imbued with Aristotle’s language and ideas that in 
earnest and unreserved conversation or in writing, 
his train of thoughts was so affected by the Ethics 
and the Rhetoric, that he cited the maxims of the 
Stagyrite as oracles, and his language was quaintly 
and easily pointed with phrases from him. I never 
knew a man who made such familiar, even fond, use 
of an author; it is scarcely too much to say that he 
spoke of him as of one intimately and affectionately 
known and valued.” ? 
For one who was destined many years later to exert 
so large an influence on the public? schools of Eng- 
land, it was a happy and appropriate circumstance 
that his own early education was obtained at public 
schools and largely influenced by the traditions of 
venerable endowments. From the age of eight to 
nearly twelve, he was at Warminster, one of the 
minor grammar schools, founded early in the eigh- 
teenth century; and thenceforward, until the age of 
sixteen, he was a scholar at Winchester. There is 
1Stanley’s Life and Correspondence. 
2 This title, ‘‘ Public Schools,” is one which may easily be misin- 
terpreted by American readers, since in their country it connotes 
the ordinary common and municipal school, which is accessible to 
all classes, and in which instruction of the most elementary char- 
acter is given. But in England the common use of the name is 
limited to ten or fifteen schools of the highest rank and the closest 
relation to the Universities, and for the most part of ancient and 
historic foundation, — Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Westminster, St. 
Paul’s, Charterhouse, Merchant Taylor’s, Rugby, and Shrewsbury 
being the most famous examples of the ‘‘ Public School” type.
-P-A-G-E-21

little to be recorded respecting his residence at the 
former of these schools, except that he always spoke 
gratefully of the obligations he owed to Dr. Griffiths, 
the head master. But his residence at Winchester 
had a far larger share in determining the future 
development of his tastes and the aims of his life. 
The oldest, nearly the richest, and in many respects 
the most illustrious, of the public schools of England, 
Winchester is specially fortunate, not only in its 
situation and its surroundings, but in its history and 
traditions. The memory of William of Wykeham, 
scholar, architect, bishop, and benefactor, the asso- 
ciation of the College with the noble Cathedral, the 
nave of which he had designed, and with New Col- 
lege, Oxford, also a monument of his genius and his 
munificence, the long roll of famous pupils, which in 
the course of more than five centuries has contained 
the names of Chichele, of Warham, Waynflete, of 
Ken, and of Lowth among ecclesiastics; of Cole, 
Grocyn, and Udal among scholars; and of Sir Thomas 
Browne, Sir Henry Wotton, Otway, Young, Collins, 
and Warton among other notable men in literature or 
in public life,—all combined to strengthen in him 
that feeling of reverence for what is ancient and 
noble, and that pride in a great intellectual inheri- 
tance, which form such potent factors in the educa- 
tion of a youth, especially of one filled with ardour 
and sensibility, and with a desire to do something 
worthy of his spiritual ancestry. In the massive 
architecture of the Cathedral, in its solemn mediz- 
val surroundings, in the neighbouring hospital of
-P-A-G-E-22
10 THOMAS ARNOLD 
Saint Cross, and in the buildings of the ancient Col- 
lege itself, there was much to kindle the imagination 
of one who loved history; and in the fair and pleas- 
ant country round, watered by the Itchen, and beau- 
tified by shady elms, there was room for delightful 
rambles, scope for boyish enterprise, and much to 
encourage that love of nature which afterwards 
showed itself to be one of his healthiest characteris- 
tics, and which exercised a purifying influence on 
the whole of his life. To the last he was a loyal 
Wykehamist, proud of his association with Winches- 
ter, grateful to the memory of Goddard and Gabell, 
who had been head masters during his stay, and 
steadfastly attached to the friends whom he had 
made while at school.

striking record of the impression he made on that 
acute observer and sympathetic friend, when he was 
an undergraduate at Corpus, and afterwards Fellow 
of Oriel. 
“His was an anxiously inquisitive mind, a scrupulously 
conscientious heart: his enquiries previously to his taking 
orders led him on to distressing doubts on certain points in 
the Articles ; these were not low nor rationalistic in their 
tendency according to the bad sense of that term, there 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 11 
was no indisposition in him to believe merely because the 
Article transcended his reason: he doubted the proof and the 
interpretation of the textual authority. His state was very 
painful, and I think morbid, for I remarked that the two 
occasions on which I was privy to the distress were precisely 
those in which to doubt was against his dearest schemes of 
worldly happiness ; and the consciousness of this seemed to 
make him distrustful of the arguments which were intended 
to lead his mind to acquiescence.” 
A friend to whose counsel he had recourse at this 
crisis, and who had advised him to pause in his 
enquiries, to seek earnestly for_further help and light 
from above, and meanwhile to turn himself more 
‘strongly than ever to the practical duties of life, 
wrote of him in 1819: 
“Tt is a defect of A.’s mind that he cannot get rid of a 
certain feeling of objections, and particularly when, as he 
fancies the bias is so strong upon him to decide one way 
from interest: he scruples doing what I advise him, which 
is to put down the objections by main force whenever they 
arise in his mind ; fearful that in so doing, he shall be vio- 
lating his conscience for a maintenance sake.” 
It may well be doubted whether the latter part of 
this friendly prescription was the best calculated to 
heal the hurt of a sensitive conscience. But the 
advice to busy himself in practical work proved very 
helpful. Little by little, though after severe trials, 
“He fought his doubts and gathered strength, 
He would not make his judgment blind ; 
He faced the spectres of the mind — 
And laid them: thus he came at length

tion, a hold _neverabandonedor relaxed. Perhaps in arriving at this result he was helped most by 
Hooker and Butler, whom to the last he held in 
higher estimation than any other of the English 
divines, even than Jeremy Taylor, whose genius, no 
less than his devout aspirations after holiness, he 
greatly admired. He certainly owed little to Paley’s 
evidences, or any of the colder evidential theology 
of the eighteenth century. Very sadly, he said in 
late life in reference to his youthful studies: ? “There 
appears to me in the English divines a want of be- 
lieving or of disbelieving anything, because it is true 
or false. It is a question which does not seem to 
occur to them.” This sentence is characteristic of 
the impatience with which he always treated what 
seemed to him insincere or half-hearted attempts to 
defend the Christian faith. His passionate desire to 
see clearly into the truth of things, and to brush away 
all hindrances and prejudices by which counsel might

than most men’s certainties. 
mental and spiritual outfit with which he enté 
upon the duties of his life were in many ways hap- 
“pily adapted to the part he was destined to playin 
the world. Without fortune, but with all the com- 
forts and shelter of a godly home, he was free from 
~any temptation to idleness or éxtravagance, and 
conscious from the first that his future was to be 
assured only by his own strenuous effort. Without 
aironage or the help of iafuontial Triste, he was 
enabled to breathe the atmosphere of a renowned pub- 
lic school, and to make valuable friendships there. 
With tastes especially directed towards history and 
language, and to ethical and political problems, his 
studies were precisely such as had the closest rela- 
tion to a profession in which the formation of 
character is of no less importance than the com- 
munication of knowledge. And the fact that his 
religious convictions had been reached after dearly 
fought spiritual experience, helped all through life 
to place him in sympathy with young and earnest 
enquirers, to make him understand their difficulties 
and to qualify him for the office of a teacher and a 
guide.” To be fortunate in the circumstances and in 
the discipline of early life is the lot of many men. 
But it is the lot of comparatively few to find in later 
days such singular opportunities as Arnold enjoyed

of turning this discipline to useful account, or to 
be so strongly and so early penetrated with a sense 
of the obligation which the possession of privileges 
entails.

graduation and examination. The importunate claims 
of the physical sciences for fuller recognition, either 
in the teaching or the examinations of the Universi- 
ties, had not yet been urged, and had they been put 
forth at the time would have met with scant sympathy, 
either from the most influential leaders of thought in 
academic circles, or from Arnold himself. He had 
been elected scholar at Corpus Christi College on his 
admission to the University; but after taking his de- 
gree in the first class in 1814, he became a Fellow of 
Oriel, and it was in this college that his chief academic 
friendships were formed. Dean Boyle, in his Remi- 
niscences, says, “Many years ago Matthew Arnold 
said to me that he had been very much ‘struck, in 
reading again Stanley’s life of his father, with the 
high-minded religious tone of the Corpus set, as 
15

they were called, and the great interest shown by 
them in literature.”! Whately, Copleston, Davison, 
Keble, Hawkins, and Hampden were among the Fel- 
lows of Oriel. Arnold obtained the Chancellor’s 
prize for two University essays, Latin and English, 
but failed to obtain the prize for verse. What are 
now called educational problems did not possess very 
great interest in such a society. The principles of 
political and theological science, and their applica- 
tion to the social problems and the moral needs of 
the people, were, it would seem, the dominant sub- 
jects of thought and discussion in the common room 
at Oriel. Many of the residents were, as Sir John 
Coleridge said : 
“For the most part Tories in Church and State, great re- 
specters of things as they were, and not very tolerant of the 
disposition which Arnold brought with him to question their 
wisdom. Many and long were the conflicts we had and with 
unequal numbers. There can be little doubt that his rather 
pugnacious Radicalism and his hatred of the corrupt French 
Aristocracy often betrayed him into intemperate speech, and 
placed him out of sympathy with many of his associates, but 
as he afterwards said, ‘ All the associations of Oxford, which 
I loved exceedingly, blew my Jacobinism to pieces.’ ” 
And in a letter to Mr. Tucker? he afterwards said: 
“The benefits which I have received from my Oxford 
friendships have been so invaluable, as relating to points of 
the highest importance, that it is impossible for me ever to 
forget them, or to cease to look on them as the greatest 
blessings I have ever yet enjoyed in life.”

  LIFE AT LALEHAM 17 
Yet it would not be right to credit Winchester and 
Oxford with the whole of his education. The striv- 
ings and controversies of the school and the Uni- 
versity were very precious parts of the discipline 
which helped to form his opinions and to give cour- 
age and force to his mode of expressing them. But 
experiences of another kind were needed to mature 
his character and to shape the course of his life, — 
“Tmpulses of deeper birth 
Had come to him in solitude,” — 
or rather in the comparative solitude of Laleham, to 
which he betook himself in 1819. He had been 
ordained the year before, and he accepted a curacy 
in this little village, intending to take as pupils a 
small number of young men preparing for the Uni- 
versities. During the seven years succeeding his mar- 
riage in 1820 he lived in retirement, busy first with his 
pupils, and afterwards with a Lexicon to Thucydides 
and with Greek and Roman history. A pupil who 
read with him at Laleham, and resided in his house, 
Mr. Bonamy Price, subsequently a Rugby master, and 
afterwards Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, 
testifies: “The most remarkable thing, which struck 
me at once on joining the Laleham circle, was the 
wonderful healthiness of tone and feeling which pre- 
vailed in it... . Arnold’s great power as a private 
tutor resided in this, that he gave such an intense 
earnestness to life. Every pupil was made to feel that 
there was a work for him to do, that his happiness as 
well as his duty lay in doing that work well.”

On the very attractive picture which is presented in 
Dean Stanley’s pages of the tranquil life during nearly 
nine years at Laleham, of his happy domestic sur- 
roundings, and of his diligent reading, it is unneces- 
sary here to dwell. It will suffice to say that the 
interval of comparative seclusion between the active 
and quasi-public life of the University, and the yet 
more formidable storm and stress which awaited him 
at Rugby, did much to strengthen his character, to 
give solidity to his scholarship, and to deepen his 
religious convictions. The charm of the country, the 
delights of home, the daily call of duty, and the 
refreshment of congenial studies gave fulness and 
variety to his life, and made up a peaceful and 
appropriate scene for “those quiet efforts of self- 
mastery — moral and intellectual—which so well 
precede in men of a certain strength the going forth 
to the real business of life and to the contact of good 
and evil.”? He himself afterwards spoke of Laleham 
as a “place of premature rest.” The arrangement 
which he made for the division of duty between him- 
self and his partner practically confined his own 
attention to the elder pupils; and in making it, he 
showed a characteristic unwillingness to undertake 
any duty which he did not feel able to do well. For 
example: 
“Buckland is naturally fonder of the school and is in- 
clined to give it the greatest part of his attention; and I 
from my Oxford habits as naturally like the other part of

the business best ; and thus I have extended my time of 
reading with our four pupils before breakfast, from one hour 
to two. Not that I dislike being in the school, but quite 
the contrary: still, however, I have not the experience in 
that sort of work, nor the perfect familiarity with my gram- 
mar requisite to make a good master, and I cannot teach 
Homer as well as my friends Herodotus and Livy, whom I 
am now reading I suppose for the fiftieth time.” 
The distrust of his own power to interest boys led 
him to decline a friendly proposal that he should 
accept an assistant-mastership at Winchester. “It 
is a situation,” he said, “which I know myself very 
ill-qualified to fill. ... I know pretty well what 
the life of a master at Winchester would be, and feel 
equally certain that it would be, for me, excessively 
disagreeable.”* This, however, was written in 1819, 
at the beginning of his residence at Laleham. How 
the experience of the following years helped to alter 
his estimate of his own powers and duties, and to 
give him the confidence needed for the main work of 
his life, may be judged from a few brief sentences 
extracted from letters written within that period: 
“T am now working at German in good earnest, and have 
got a master who comes down here to me once a week. I 
have read a good deal of Julius Hare’s friend Niebuhr, and 
have found it abundantly overpay the labour of learning 
a new language, — to say nothing of some other very valua- 
ble books with which I am becoming acquainted, all pre- 
. paratory to my Roman History. I am going to set to work 
at the Coke upon Littleton of Roman Law to make myself

acquainted, if possible, with the tenure of property ; and I 
think I shall apply to you for the loan of some of your books 
touching the Civil law, and especially Justinian’s Jnstctutes. 
As my knowledge increases, I only get a clearer insight into 
my ignorance, and this excites me to do my best to remove 
it before I descend to the Avernus of the press. But I am 
twice the man for labour that I have been lately, for the last 
year or two, because the pupils, I thank God, are going on 
well. Ihave at this moment the pleasure of seeing three 
of them sitting at the round table in the drawing-room, all 
busily engaged about their themes. The general good effect 
of their sitting with us all the evening is really very sur- 
prising.” ? 
“What I am doing in Greek and Roman history” (he is 
referring to the articles he was preparing for the Encyclo- 
pedia Metropolitana) “is only my amusement during the 
single hour of the day that I can employ on any occupation 
of my own, namely between nine and ten in the evening. 
With such limited time it would be ridiculous to attempt 
any work which required much labour and which could not 
be promoted by my common occupations with my pupils. 
The Grecian history is just one of the things I can do most 
easily. My knowledge of it beforehand is pretty full, and 
my lectures are continually keeping the subject before my 
mind, so that to write about it is really my recreation ; and 
the Roman history is the same to me, though in a less de- 
gree. I could not have any other subject which is equally 
familiar, or which in my present circumstances would be 
practicable ; and certainly if I can complete plain and popu- 
lar histories of Greece and Rome of a moderate size, cleared 
of nonsense and non-Christian principles, I do not think I 
shall be amusing myself ill.”

LITERARY AIMS 21 
“Tt has been my wish to avoid giving my pupils any 
Greek to do on Sunday, so that we do Greek Testament on 
other days, but on the Sunday always do some English book, 
and they read so much; then I ask them questions on it. 
But I find it almost impossible to make them read a mere 
English book with sufficient attention to enable them to 
answer questions out of it, or if they do cram themselves for 
the time, they are sure to forget it directly after.” 
“T cannot tell you how the present state of the country 
occupies my mind, and what a restless desire I feel that it 
were in my power to do any good.” * 
“T hope to be allowed before I die to accomplish some- 
thing on Education, also with regard to the Church — the 
last indeed, even more than the other, were not the last, 
humanly speaking, so hopeless.” * 
“What say you to a work on odurexy in the old Greek 
sense of the word, in which I should try to apply the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel to the legislation and administration of 
a state?” > 
“How pure and beautiful was John Keble’s article on 
Sacred Poetry for the Quarterly, and how glad I am that 
he was prevailed upon to write it. It seemed to me to 
sanctify in a manner the whole number. Mine on the early 
Roman history was slightly altered by Coleridge here and 
there, so that I am not quite responsible for all of it.” * 
Ideals and aspirations thus formed and cherished 
would not long have been satisfied with the restricted 
area of activity which Laleham afforded; and when,

Rugby, the prospect of succeeding to that office was 
not only opportune but peculiarly welcome. Among 
the testimonies in his favour, probably the weightiest 
was that of his old associate at Oriel, Dr. Hawkins, 
wx the Proygst, who gave it as his opinion, that “if 
{Fara were elected, he would change the face of 
education all through the public schools of Eng- 
land.” He himself was not without misgivings 
about his own adequacy for the task, but was never- 
theless conscious of powers which had not yet found 
their fullest exercise, and he responded with charac- 
teristic courage and eagerness to what seemed to him 
S the call of duty. Before the election, he wrote, “If 
{I do get it, I feel as if I could set to work very 
heartily, and, with God’s blessing, I should like to 
try whether my notions of Christian education are 
really impracticable, whether our system of public 
schools has not in it some noble elements, which, 
under the blessing of the Spirit of all holiness and 
wisdom, might produce fruit even to life eternal. 
When I think about it thus, I really long to take rod 
in hand; but when I think of the zpés 76 rédos, the 
perfect vileness which I must daily contemplate, 
the certainty that this can only be partially reme- 
died, the irksomeness of ‘fortemque Gyan, fortemque 
Cloanthum,’ and the greater form and publicity of 
the life we should there lead . . . I grieve to think 
of the possibility of a change.”?

on Dec. 2, 1827.

  ELECTION TO RUGBY 23 
After the election his letters have a more reassur- 
ing tone. “I have long since looked upon Education 
as my business in life. . . . You know that I never 
ran down public schools in the lump, but grieved 
that their exceeding capabilities were not turned to 
better account, and if I find myself in time unable to 
mend what I consider faulty in them, it will at any 
rate be a practical lesson to teach me to judge chari- 
tably of others who do not reform public institutions 
as much as is desirable.”! And in writing to J.T. 
Coleridge, he says: “John Keble is right, it is good v 
for us to leave Laleham, because I feel that we were 
daily getting to regard it as too much of a home. 
cannot tell you how much we both love it, and - 
perfect peace seems at times an appalling contrast to 
the publicity of Rugby. I am sure that ny m3 
could stifle this regret, were it not for my aN 
consciousness that I have nothing to do with rest 
here, but with labour; and then I can and do look ; 
forward to the labour with nothing but soe 
tion, if my health and faculties be still spared tow 
me.” 
The trustees of the school, who were chiefly. ee 
men and country gentlemen of Warwickshire, of 
whom no one was personally known to Arnold, 
elected him to the office when he was thirty-tw 
years of age, and he entered on his new duties in 
the August of 1828. The school had then the 
reputation of being the lowest and most Beotian 
of English public schools; perhaps it was

theories of his own, and conscious of his power to

Lawrence SHERIFF, grocer, in 1567 left land and 
some property in Middlesex to maintain a “fair and 
convenient schoolhouse at Rugby.” Half a century 
before, Erasmus had been lecturing on Greek at Cam- 
bridge, and had advised his friend, Colet, in respect 
to the foundation of St. Paul’s School in London. 
Within that interval no fewer than one hundred and 
.thirty-seven endowed grammar schools had been 
founded, including Manchester, Bosworth, Durham, 
Chester, ‘Warwick, Ipswich, Skipton, Norwich, Sher- 
borne, Louth, Sedbergh, Birmingham, Leeds, Shrews- 
bury, Christ’s Hospital, Tonbridge, Ripon, York, 
Westminster, Bristol, Merchant Taylors’, Highgate, 
Bedford, and Richmond. Some of these had been 
founded by Henry VIII., Edward VI., or Elizabeth, 
and endowed with the property of dissolved monas-

teries. Others owed their origin to ecclesiastical 
corporations, but for the most part they were the 
product of private munificence, whether of scholars, 
like Dean Colet and Archbishop Holgate, or traders, 
like Sir Andrew Judd of Tonbridge and Lawrence 
Sheriff of Rugby. These men had been profoundly 
influenced by the new hopes and prospects of learning 
which characterized the period of the Renaissance 
and the Reformation, and desired to make permanent 
provision for instruction in the Greek and Latin 
tongues, then the only learning which had been 
formulated and reduced to a system. The record of 
the development and increasing wealth and repute of 
Sheriff’s foundation will be found at length in Car- 
lisle’s Endowed Grammar Schools,’ 1818, and in Mr. 
Thomas Hughes’ lucid and interesting sketch in 
Great Public Schools. The most important material 
additions to the ground and to the building and its 
equipment were made by the trustees during the 
_ mastership of Dr. John Wooll, Arnold’s immediate 
predecessor, who presided over the school from 1810 
till 1827. Of him Mr. Hughes says: “My own belief 
is that Wooll was a kindly gentleman and a good 
scholar and teacher, but a,chgleric as well ag exceed- Faia

tions which, with American readers, may possibly be connected 
with this name. In the United States the grammar school is sim- 
ply the upper department of an ordinary public elementary school, 
and is distinctly inferior to a ‘‘ high’’ or secondary school. But in 
England the name is generally understood to apply to those insti- 
tutions, generally some centuries old, which were founded expressly 
for instruction in the Latin and Greek languages, and were designed 
to prepare scholars for the Universities.

ingly vigorous little Hercules in black tights, who 
brought from Winchester the faith that the argu- 
mentum baculinum is a necessary supplement to ‘man- 
ners’ in the ‘making of men’ who are to construe 
Greek plays and write Latin longs and shorts. As 
to the rest, the discipline of the school and boarding- 
houses, and any kind of supervision over the boys’ 
life and habits, there were really none, except that 
missing a ‘calling over’ entailed a certain flogging. 
They were left to themselves, with the inevitable 
result. As specimens of the condition of things 
which his successor had to deal with, I may mention 
that beagles and guns were kept by the sportsmen 
among the big fellows, and that those whose tastes 
turned that way had private cellars in the studies.” ! 
The worthy Lawrence Sheriff, it must be remem- 
bered to his honour, did not attempt to impose upon 
his successors any educational theories of his own, or 
any restrictions as to the aims or methods which 
should be pursued in the school. The trustees were 
enjoined in the paper annexed to his will to procure 
an “honest, discrete, and learned man, being a Mas- 
ter of Arts to take charge of the house as a Free 
Grammar School,” and this was a sufficient descrip- 
tion well understood in his day of the kind of insti- 
tution he desired to endow. Other “pious founders,” 
with less modesty, and a more limited view of the 
possibilities of the future, had prescribed with curious 
minuteness, not merely the subjects and the order of 
studies, but even the books which should be used and

-P-A-G-E-40
ov 28 THOMAS ARNOLD 
the hours at which lessons should be begun and ended 
as well as the scholarly and other qualifications which 
the head master and his assistants should possess. 
Two examples of this kind will suffice. 
Archbishop Grindal (1583), in the elaborate statutes 
which he laid down for the free grammar school of 
St. Bees, prescribed that the schoolmaster should be 
“a meet and learned person, that can make Greek 
and Latin verses, and read and interpret the Greek 
Grammar and other Greek authors.” His scheme. of 
instruction, set forth with great minuteness, may be 
fairly accepted as typical of that conception of a 
liberal education which prevailed at the end of the 
sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. 
“The schoolmaster shall carefully seek to bring up all his 
scholars equally in learning and good manners, and shall 
refuse none being born in the counties of Cumberland and 
Westmoreland, of whom he shall receive only four pence 
apiece at their first coming, for the entering of their names 
into his book, and no more for their teaching. He shall en- 
courage the good natured, and those that are toward in learn- 
ing, by praising and preferring them to higher places, and 
shall dispraise and displace the slothful and untoward that 
either for love of commendation or fear of shame, they may 
be provoked to learn and profit at their books. He shall 
chiefly labour to make his scholars perfect in the Latin and 
Greek grammar, and to the end they may better profit 
therein, he shall exercise them in the best authors in both 
tongues that are meet for their capacity. Provided always 
that the first books of construction that they shall read, 
either in Latin or Greek, shall be the smaller catechisms 
set forth by public authority for that purpose in the said

tongues, which we will that they shall learn by heart, that 
with the knowledge of the tongues, they may also learn their 
duty towards God and man.” 
Dean Colet (1509) had prescribed for his famous 
school at St. Paul’s, ordinances which furnished a 
model for many of the sixteenth century foundation 
deeds and was fairly characteristic of the revived 
taste for learning which prevailed at that time. 
“JT will that the children learne first above all the Cate- 
chizon in Englishe, and after the Accidens, that I made or 
some other, if any be better for the purpose, to induce 
children more speedily to Latin speche. And then Jnstz- 
tutum Christiant Hominis which that learned Erasmus 
made at my request, and the book called Copia of the 
same Erasmus. And then other authors, Christian, as 
Prudentius and Proba and Sedulius and Juvencus and 
Baptista Mantuanus, and such others as shall be thought 
convenient, and most to purpose unto the true Latin speche. 
All Barbary, all corruption, all Latin adulterate which 
ignorant blind fooles brought into this world, and with the 
same hath distayned and poisoned the very Roman tongue 
which in the time of 7'udly and Sallust and Virgil and 
Terence was used, which also St. Jerome and St. Ambrose 
and St. Austin and many holy doctors learned in their 
times, I utterly bannyshe and exclude out of the schole ; 
and charge the Masters that they teche always that is beste 
and instruct the children in Greke and redynge Latin, in 
redynge unto them such authors that hath with wisdom 
joyned the pure chaste eloquence.” 
“That they teche always that is beste,” — This is a 
high and generous utterance and represents fairly the 
spirit of the Renaissance and of the founders of gram-

mar schools. It is because Latin and Greek were the 
best intellectual-aids then known, and the keys to all 
the knowledge then best worth having, that these lan- 
guages formed the staple of a gentleman’s training. 
No higher conception of. a liberal education could 
possibly be formed than that each age should furnish 
its youth with its best. But this object is to be 
attained by imitating the spirit rather than the letter 
of founder’s statutes, and by such a study of the needs 
and circumstances of our own age as may enable us 
to do for our contemporaries what Colet and Grindal 
sought to do for theirs, and what they would probably 
have done had they lived now. 
It cannot be claimed for Arnold that he was eager 
to emancipate himself from the traditions thus inher- 
ited from the sixteenth century. We cannot concede 
to him the character of a great reformer or revolution- 
ist in the sense in which Comenius, Rousseau, Locke, 
or Pestalozzi was entitled to one of those designations. 
He was not a realist, but essentially a “humanist” of 
the type of Milton. He accepted the traditions of the 
long succession of English teachers, from Ascham and 
Colet down to Busby and Keate, in favour of making 
the study of language, and particularly the languages 
of Greece and Rome, the staple of a liberal education. 
But, like Milton, he rebelled strongly against the 
wooden, mechanical, and pedantic fashion in which 
those languages were often taught, as if the attain- 
ment of proficiency in them were an end in itself and 
not the means to some higher end. Milton had pro- 
tested against the “preposterous exactions by which
-P-A-G-E-43

the empty wits of children were forced to compose 
themes, verses, and orations, which are the acts of 
ripest judgement; and were thus mocked and deluded 
with ragged notions and babblements while they ex- 
pected worthy and delightful knowledge.”? He 
would indeed have the pupil introduced to a great 
variety of Greek and Roman authors, poets, philoso- 
phers, and orators, but mainly that through and by 
means of these writers, he might obtain access to the 
best thought and culture which the world could af- 
ford, and so become acquainted with history and 
political science, with logic, with the principles of 
law and morals, with geometry and natural philoso- 
phy, with the story of heroes and statesmen, so as to 
“stir up learners with high hopes of becoming brave 
men and worthy patriots dear to God and famous to 
all ages.” In like manner Arnold, while founding 
his whole educational system on the study of the 
ancient languages, sought mainly to use those lan- 
guages as instruments for a large extension of the 
range of subjects beyond the traditional routine. 
Greek and Latin were to him the wrod or, the firm 
earth on which he sought to erect a fabric in which 
history, poetry, philosophy, ethics, love of truth, 
and aspirations after nobleness and usefulness should 
find their due place. 
Accordingly we are not to expect from him any 
attempt to dissociate himself from the traditional 
belief of scholars that, after all, knowledge of lan- 
guage was the truest measure of a boy’s ability and

promise. In classifying new pupils, he would not 
have cared to adopt the multifarious method of mod- 
ern entrance examinations, with their options and 
alternatives. The form into which a new scholar 
was to be entered was determined by his acquaint- 
ance with grammar and vocabulary, and by little 
else. When the little Arthur Stanley, at the age 
of thirteen, went up to Rugby, and had concluded his 
first awful visit to the Doctor, he wrote to his sister 
Mary, “Papa and I walked to Dr. Arnold’s, and pres- 
ently Mrs. Arnold came in; she was very nice indeed. 
At last came the Doctor himself, but I certainly 
should not have taken him for a doctor. He was 
very pleasant and did not look old. When Papa 
asked him whether I could be examined, he said that 
if I would walk into the next room he would do it 
himself; so of course I went with him, with a feeling 
like that when I am going to have a tooth drawn. So 
he took down a Homer, and I read about half a dozen 
lines, and the same with Virgil; he then asked me a 
little about my Latin verses, and set me down without 
more ado in the great book as placed in the fourth 
form. I felt such a weight off my mind when that 
was done.”? 
In Arnold’s own account of the school, contributed 
to the Journal of Education, 1834, he describes at 
length its general aims and methods. He sets forth 
a graduated scheme of instruction extending from the 
first to the sixth form. It will suffice here to give in

  The article proceeds to defend the principle on 
which so large a proportion of the time and attention 
are devoted to the Greek and Roman classics. The 
writer admits frankly that the “first origin of classi- 
cal education affords in itself no reasons for continu- 
ing it now. When Latin and Greek were almost 
the only written languages of civilized man, it is 
manifest that they must have furnished the subjects 
of all liberal education. The question, therefore, is 
wholly changed since the growth of a complete litera- 
ture in other languages; since France and Italy and 
Germany and England have each produced their phi- 
losophers, their poets, and their historians worthy to 
be placed on the same level with those of Greece and 
Rome.” He shows that, “although there is not the 
same reason now which existed three or four cen- 
turies ago for the study of Greek and Roman litera- 
ture, there are others no less substantial.” These 
reasons he finds in the familiar facts that the gram- 
matical forms of Greek and Latin are at once perfect
-P-A-G-E-47
GREEK AND LATIN LANGUAGES 35 
and incapable of seing understood without long and 
minute attention; that the study of them involves the 
general principles of grammar, and that their peculiar 
excellences illustrate the conditions under which lan- 
guage may become clear and forcible and beautiful. 
And apart from the linguistic training afforded, he 
set a peculiar value on the general broadening of the 
intellectual horizon which attended the study of the 
literature and history of the ancient world. 
“Expel Greek and Latin from your schools,” he says, 
“and you confine the views of the existing generation to 
themselves and their immediate predecessors, you will cut off 
so many centuries of the world’s experience, and place us in 
the same state as if the human race had first come into 
existence in the year 1500... . Aristotle and Plato and 
Thucydides and Cicero and Tacitus are most untruly called 
ancient writers. They are virtually our own countrymen 
and contemporaries, but have the advantage which is enjoyed 
by intelligent travellers, that their observation has been ex- 
ercised in a field out of the reach of common men, and that 
having thus seen in a manner with our eyes what we cannot 
see for ourselves, their conclusions are such as bear upon 
our own circumstances ; while their information has all the 
charm of novelty, and all the value of a mass of new and 
pertinent facts, illustrative of the great science of the nature 
of civilized man.” 
In reply to the familiar argument that men in after 
life often throw their Greek and Latin aside, and that 
this fact shows the uselessness of such early studies, 
the article goes on to emphasize a view which is too 
often lost sight of in popular discussion, whether in 
relation to the higher or the lower departments of 
 
-P-A-G-E-48

educational work. It is not uncommon to find critics 
who seek to discredit the arithmetic and geography 
and the grammar of the elementary school by urging 
that much of the knowledge so acquired is soon for- 
gotten. No doubt itis. So is a great part of all the 
knowledge received by learners at all ages, and in 
reference to all subjects. But this does not prove 
that the acquisition is barren or useless. It may not 
survive in the exact form in which it has been first 
imparted. But it has for the time served its pur- 
pose; it has helped to put the mind into a better atti- 
tude for the acquisition of further knowledge, and it 
has left behind it such a residuum of thought and 
experience as will make it easy to revert to the sub- 
ject and learn it anew, if special occasion for it should 
arise. In fact, nothing which is honestly learned, 
ard which forms a legitimate part of a scheme of 
instruction having an organic unity and a clear pur- 
pose of its own, can ever be rightly regarded as worth- 
less; and no time spent in acquiring such details is 
ever wasted, even though they may have disappeared 
from the memory and left no visible result. Arnold’s 
argument was sound and admits of far wider applica- 
tion than to the particular department of education 
to which he was especially interested. “It does not 
follow that when a man lays aside his Latin and 
Greek books, he forgets also all that he had ever 
gained from them. This, however, is so far from 
being the case, that even where the results of a clas- 
sical education are least tangible and least appreci- 
ated, even by the individual himself, still the mind
-P-A-G-E-49
  CLASSICAL STUDIES VINDICATED 37 
often retains much of the effect of its early studies in 
the general liberality of its tastes and comparative 
comprehensiveness of its views and actions.” 
But all this presupposes that the teaching is intel- 
ligent and that the teacher has so far emancipated 
himself from routine as to be able to discriminate 
between what is mechanical and sterile, and that 
which is formative and vital in the classical tradi- 
tion. The mere scholar, he contended, cannot pos- 
sibly communicate to his pupils the main advantage 
of a classical education. 
“The knowledge of the past is valuable, because without 
it our knowledge of the present and of the future must be 
scanty: but if the knowledge of the past be confined wholly 
to itself; if instead of being made to bear upon things 
around us, it be totally isolated from them, and so disguised 
by vagueness and misapprehension as to appear incapable of 
illustrating them, then indeed it becomes little better than 
laborious trifling, and they who declaim against it may be 
fully forgiven.” * 
The characteristic of Arnold as a schoolmaster was 
that he was much more concerned to put new life, 
freshness, and meaning into the received methods 
than to invent new ones. What is imitable in his 
system —if system it may be called —is not a new 
educational creed or practice, but the infusion into 
the system of a new spirit, one of enthusiasm, of 
clear insight into the inner intellectual and moral 
needs of scholars, and of careful introspection in 
reference to those studies which had enriched his 
1 Arnold’s Miscellaneous Works, p. 350.

own character and intellect most. Dean Stanley 
says of him, “He was the first Englishman who drew 
attention in our public schools to the historical, 
political, and philosophical value of philology and of 
the ancient writers as distinguished from the mere 
verbal criticism and elegant scholarship of the last 
century.” This may be illustrated in his treatment 
of composition exercises, of which he says: 
“There are Exercises in Composition in Greek and Latin 
prose, Greek and Latin verse, and English prose as in other 
large classical schools. In the subjects given for original 
composition in the higher forms there is a considerable va- 
riety, — historical descriptions of any remarkable events, 
geographical descriptions of countries, imaginary speeches 
and letters supposed to be spoken or written on some great 
question, or under some memorable circumstances ; etymo- 
logical accounts of words in different languages, and criti- 
cisms on different books are found to offer an advantageous 
variety to the essays on moral subjects to which the boy’s 
prose composition has sometimes been confined.” ? 
Dean Stanley gives in an interesting appendix a 
selection of the themes chosen for composition exer- 
cises, from which a few characteristic examples may 
be cited here: 
(a) The differences between advantages and merits. 
(0) Conversation between Thomas Aquinas, James 
Watt, and Walter Scott. 
(c) The principal events and men of England, 
France, and German and Holland a.p. 1600.

(dq) How far the dramatic faculty is compatible 
with a love of truth. 
(e) De seculo, quo Esais vaticinia sua edidit. 
It will be seen that there is very little of the icono- 
clastic temper in this description of his methods. He 
did not even attack the time-honoured superstition 
that the manufacture of Latin and Greek verses was 
the ultimate test and crown of scholarship. It is 
true he did not like it. He rebelled, as Milton did, 
against a theory which imposed on young boys a task 
for which they were wholly unfit; he was conscious 
of the preposterous absurdity of regarding the fitting 
together of longs and shorts as a true Gradus ad 
Parnassum, but he nevertheless sought to make the 
best of the method and to clothe the dry bones with 
flesh and blood. 
But it may be doubted whether he ever fully real- 
ized the enormous injury done to the rank and file of 
boys by this antiquated and soulless exercise; the 
inevitable weariness and disgust produced by it; the 
false and ignoble ideal of scholarship which it set 
before them, or the intellectual habits which it gener- 
ates. An eminent public schoolmaster of a later 
generation has had the courage to speak with great 
frankness on this point. He says: 
“Without a conception of rhythm, without a gleam of 
imagination, without a touch of fancy, boys are set down to 
write verses, and these verses are to be in an unknown 
tongue in which they scarcely possess a germ of the scantiest 
vocabulary, or a mastery of the most simple construction ; 
and further, it is to be in strict imitation of poets of whom,  
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 THOMAS ARNOLD 
at their best, they have only read a few score of lines. . . . 
The pupil is required under all the inexorable exigencies of 
metre to reproduce in artificial and phraseological Latin the 
highly elaborate thoughts of grown men, to piece their muti- 
lated fancies, and reproduce their fragmentary conceits. In 
most cases the very possibility of doing so depends on his 
hitting upon a particular epithet, which presents the requi- 
site combination of longs and shorts, or on his evolving some 
special and often recondite turn of thought and expression. 
Supposing, for instance (to take a very easy line, typical of 
many thousands of lines), he has to write a pentameter. 
‘Where Acheron rolls waters.’ 
He will feel that his entire task is to write where something 
Acheron rolls something waters. His one object is to get in 
the something which shall be of the right shape to screw 
into the line. The epithet may be ludicrous; it may be 
grotesque, but provided he can make his brick he does not 
trouble himself about the quality of his straw, and it mat- 
ters nothing to him, if it be a brick such as could not by any 
possibility be used in any human building. It is a literal 
fact, that a boy very rarely reads through the English he is 
doing, or knows, when it has been turned into Latin, what it 
is all about ; hence, for the next year or two his life resolves 
itself into a boundless hunt after epithets of the right 
shape, to be screwed into the greatest number of places; a 
practice exactly analogous to the putting together of Chinese 
puzzles, only producing a much less homogeneous and con- 
gruous result,” + 
Whatever may be urged in favour of the theory of 
verse composition as a youthful effort of imagination, 
as a discipline in taste and literary discrimination,

  THE MANUFACTURE OF LATIN VERSES 41 
or in the right choice and use of words, there can be 
no doubt that in practice the “sad mechanic exer- 
cise” is wearisome and uninspiring, and involves an 
appalling waste of time. There was, for example, a 
common form of exercise, called a “vulgus,” a sub- 
ject being given out, and a fixed number of eight or 
ten lines being required to be produced and recited in 
class next morning. There was also in common use 
a collection of traditionary vulguses, consisting of 
past exercises copied and accumulated and used over 
and over again with small and colourable alterations. 
Even those boys who did the work honestly cared for 
little except to piece together a few lines which would 
scan tolerably; but many omitted to take the trouble, 
and got younger and cleverer boys to write for them. 
Like all forms of teaching which do not awaken the 
genuine interest of the scholar or challenge his 
sympathies, the system of compulsory verse-making 
lends itself with peculiar facility to school-boy arti- 
fices and evasive tricks. The copying out of another 
boy’s vulgus or verse exercise, and the surreptitious 
use of “cribs,” became so common that it was very hard 
even for an honest boy to convince himself that they 
were wrong. Mr, Hughes, who is certainly not an 
unfriendly witness where the public school traditions 
are concerned, puts into the mouth of Harry East, 
who, on the whole, was meant to represent a lad of 
average ability, with a code of honour which, if not 
exalted, was at least respectable, a very brief state- 
ment of the school-boy creed on this point :
-P-A-G-E-54
42 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“Tt’s a fair trial of skill between us and the masters, like 
a match at football or a battle. We're natural enemies 
in school, that’s a fact. We've got to learn so much Latin 
and Greek and do so many verses, and they’ve got to see 
that we do it. If you can slip the collar and do so much 
less without getting caught, that’s one to us. If they can 
get more out of you, or catch us shirking, that’s one to 
them. All’s fair in war but lying. If I run my luck 
against theirs and go into school without looking at my 
lessons, why am I a snob or a sneak? I don’t tell the 
master I have learned it; he’s got to find out whether I 
have or not. What's he paid for? If he calls me up and 
I get floored, he makes me write it out in Greek and Eng- 
lish — very good ; he’s caught me, and I don’t grumble. I 
grant you, if I go and snivel to him and tell him I’ve really 
tried to learn it, but found it so hard without a translation, 
or say I’ve had a toothache or any humbug of that kind, I’m 
a snob—that’s my school morality. It’s served me for 
these five years, and it’s all clear and fair, no mistake about 
it. We understand it, and they understand it, and I do 
not see what we are to come to with any other.”? 
It is right, however, to say that later experience 
modified Arnold’s views respecting the educative 
yalue of verse-composition. In a letter to Mr. Jus- 
tice Coleridge in 1833, he said: 
“You will be amused when I tell you that I am becom- 
ing more and more a convert to the advantages of Latin and 
Greek verse, and more suspicious of the mere fact system ; 
that would cram with knowledge of particular things, and 
call it information. My own lessons with the Sixth Form 
are directed now to the best of my power to the furnishing 
rules or formule for them to work with, e.g. rules to be

-P-A-G-E-55
  ARNOLD’S CHANGE OF OPINION 43 
observed in translation, principles of taste as to the choice 
of English words, as to the keeping or varying idioms and 
metaphors, etc., or in history, rules of evidence, or general 
forms for the dissection of campaigns, or the estimating the 
importance of wars, revolutions, etc. This, together with 
the opening as it were the sources of knowledge, by telling 
them where they can find such and such things, and giving 
them a notion of criticism, not to swallow things whole as 
the scholars of an earlier period too often did, is what I am 
labouring at, much more than at giving information. And 
the composition is mending decidedly, though speaking to 
an Etonian I am well aware that our amended state would 
be with you a very degenerate one. But we are looking up 
certainly, and pains are taking in the Lower Forms, of 
which we shall, I think, soon see the fruit.” ? 
It may well be doubted whether this partial re- 
cantation does much to prove that the system was 
a good one. In teaching, that system which is best 
administered is best, and Arnold had the power of 
putting a soul into a method which, in other hands, 
might prove sterile and mechanical. The arguments 
against verse-making as an intellectual exercise for 
common use and under the treatment of average 
teachers remain unanswered; and their force is no- 
wise diminished by the fact that now and then an 
enthusiastic and inspiring’ head master ean contrive 
to make the exercise effective. 
To another of the traditional usages of the classical 
schools — the practice of construing — Arnold had less 
scruple in expressing his emphatic objection. He 
regarded this form of exercise as another illustration 
1 Letter LXXIV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 THOMAS ARNOLD 
of the tendency to neglect the literary art for the 
sake of those formalities of detail which concern the 
material form rather than the spiritual meaning of 
literature. He thought that the efforts of teachers 
to secure attention to the parts of a sentence often 
made it difficult for a learner to understand its sig- 
nificance as a whole. 
“Every lesson in Greek or Latin,” he said, “may, or 
ought to be made a lesson in English; the translation of 
every sentence in Demosthenes or Tacitus is properly an 
exercise in extemporaneous English composition ; a problem 
how to express with equal brevity, clearness, and force in 
our own language, the thought which the original author 
has so admirably expressed in his. But the system of con- 
struing, far from assisting, is positively injurious to our 
knowledge and use of English ; it accustoms it to a tame 
and involved arrangement of our words, and to the substitu- 
tion of foreign idioms in the place of such as are national ; 
it obliges us to caricature every sentence that we render, by 
turning what is, in its original dress, beautiful and natural, 
into something which is neither Greek nor English, stiff, 
obscure, and flat, exemplifying all the faults incident to 
language and excluding every excellence. The exercise of 
translation, on the other hand, meaning by translation the 
expressing of an entire sentence of a foreign language by an 
entire sentence of our own, as opposed to the rendering sepa- 
rately into English either every separate word, or at most 
only parts of the sentence, whether larger or smaller, the 
exercise of translation is capable of furnishing improvement 
to students of every age according to the measure of their 
abilities and knowledge.” ! 
The whole of the paper from which this extract is

  CONSTRUING VERSUS TRANSLATION 45 
taken well deserves the attentive study of those 
engaged in the teaching of Latin and Greek, as it 
illustrates, in several ways, the relation between the 
study of separate words and grammatical forms on 
the one hand, and the culture of the language faculty 
and the development of a true literary taste on the 
other. Unless Arnold could establish a real rapport 
between the learning of an ancient language and a 
fuller command of the resources of our own, he was 
disposed to regard what is called mere classical learn- 
ing as a barren and pedantic accomplishment. For 
example, he insisted on the importance of following 
in English the analogy required by the age and char- 
acter of the original writer; e.g. “In translating 
Homer hardly any words should be employed except 
Saxon and the oldest and simplest of those which are 
of French origin, and the language should consist of 
a series of simple propositions connected with one 
another only by the most inartificial conjunctions. 
In translating the tragedians, the words should be 
principally Saxon, but mixed with many of French 
or foreign origin, like the language of Shakespeare 
and the other dramatists of the reign of Elizabeth 
and James I. ... So, also, in translating the prose 
writers of Greece and Rome; Herodotus should be 
rendered in the style and language of the chroniclers; 
Thucydides in that of Bacon or Hooker; while De- 
mosthenes, Cicero, Cesar, and Tacitus require a style 
completely modern, the perfection of the English lan- 
guage such as we now speak and write it, varied only 
to suit the individual differences of the different
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 THOMAS ARNOLD 
writers, but in its range of words, and in its idioms, 
substantially the same.” 
It is interesting to compare with these views those 
of an older schoolmaster, Bowyer, of Christ’s Hos- 
pital, of whom one of his most illustrious pupils 
speaks with affectionate gratitude. 
“T enjoyed,” says Coleridge, “the inestimable advantage 
of a very sensible, though at the same time a very severe 
master. He early moulded my taste to the preference of 
Demosthenes to Cicero, of Homer to Theocritus and Virgil, 
and again of Virgil to Ovid. He habituated me to compare 
Lucretius (in such extracts as I then read), Terence, and 
above all the chaster poetry of Catullus, not only with the 
Roman poets of the so-called silver and brazen age, but with 
even those of the Augustan era, and on grounds of plain 
sense and universal logic to see and assert the superiority of 
the former in the truth and naturalness both of their thoughts 
and diction. At the same time that we were studying the 
Greek tragic poets, he made us read Shakespeare and Milton 
as lessons, and they were the lessons too which required 
most time and trouble to bring up so as to escape his cen- 
sure. I learned from him that poetry, even that of the 
loftiest and seemingly that of the wildest odes, had a logic 
of its own as severe as that of science, and more difficult 
because more subtle, more complex and more dependent on 
more and more fugitive causes. In the truly great poets he 
would say, there is a reason assignable not only for every 
word, but for the position of every word, and I well remem- 
ber that availing himself of the synonyms to the Homer of 
Didymus, he made us attempt to show, with regard to 
each, why it would not have answered the same purpose, 
and wherein consisted the peculiar fitness of the word in 
the original text.”

-P-A-G-E-59
EDWARD THRING’S VIEW 47 
It is not to be understood that Arnold’s unqualified 
contempt for the practice of construing, and his pref- 
erence for translating, represent the final result of all 
experience in reference to the teaching of a language. 
The truth is that both processes, in their due measure 
and proportion, are needed for the thorough compre- 
hension of an ancient author. There can be no real 
perception of the meaning of a sentence as a whole, 
unless the learner can, if challenged, explain the sig- 
nificance of each single word and the part it plays 
in the final result. Readers of Mr. Thring’s rather 
puzzling but inspiring book will remember what im- 
portance he attached to what he called “sentence 
anatomy,” and will understand why, in the practice 
of that famous teacher, the construing lesson assumed 
greater importance than in Arnold’s method. Fun- 
damentally, however, the aims of both teachers were 
identical. “The ultimate end,” said Thring, “of the 
study of the classics, is to make the learner an artist 
in words and a conscious master of his own tongue.” ? 
Arnold regarded the conventional method largely 
practised in public schools as ill adapted to its pro- 
fessed purpose, and in reply to those who argued that 
translation without construing led to inaccuracy and 
slovenliness, urged in the article already quoted, that 
“It is a mere chimera to suppose, as many do, that what 
they call free translation is a convenient cover for inaccurate 
scholarship. It can only be so through the incompetence or 
carelessness of the teacher. If the force of every part of 
1 Theory and Practice of Teaching, p. 111.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 THOMAS ARNOLD 
the sentence be not fully given, the translation is so far 
faulty ; but idiomatic translation, much more than literal, is 
an evidence that the translator does see the force of the 
original, and it should be remembered that the very object 
of so translating is to preserve the spirit of an author, when 
it would be lost or weakened by translating literally ; but 
where a literal translation happens to be faithful to the 
spirit, then, of course, it should be adopted, and any omis- 
sion or misrepresentation of any part of the bearing of the 
original does not preserve its spirit, but, as far as it goes, 
sacrifices it and is not to be called free translation, but rather 
imperfect, blundering, or in a word bad translation.” 
A later writer, distinguished no less by success as 
a teacher than by an extensive acquaintance with the 
philosophy of education, has embodied the common- 
sense view of the whole question in one or two vigor: 
ous sentences. Mr. Storr says: 
“Let me urge you to set your faces as a rock against the 
system of literal construing, which not only prevails in most 
class-rooms, but is even justified and encouraged by pedantic 
and unscrupulous schoolmasters. The head-masters have 
lately been telling us that for the classically trained boy Eng- 
lish literature is of the nature of a superfluity, a sort of gild- 
ing the refined gold of Greek or painting the lily of Latinity, 
that the best way of learning our native tongue is to learn to 
translate Thucydides and Cicero, and to turn Shakespeare and 
Tennyson into Greek iambics and Latin elegiacs. The theory 
is too ridiculous to need repeating here, and its absurdity is 
sufficiently demonstrated by the slipshod and ungrammati- 
cal English in which some of these classically trained head- 
masters express their theories on English Composition. And 
yet it has a foundation of truth, provided always that, for the 
first stage, idiomatic English is insisted on. No one, after 
once the sentence had to be analysed, would ever dream of 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  RELATION OF CLASSICAL TO OTHER STUDIES 49 
translating literally Comment vous portez-vous ? but pedantry 
will insist on boys rendering year after year Latin historical 
presents by English presents, Latin ablative absolutes by 
the absolute construction (that is the commonest of all 
Latin idioms), by turns which are rare in English and only 
half naturalised, and representing Greek redundancies by 
English synonyms.” ? 
So, although to the last the study of language 
appeared to Arnold the best available instrument for 
the education of mankind, it was not mere grammar 
or philology which seemed to him the most fruitful 
part of linguistic discipline, but the indirect effect of 
the study on the cultivation of studies other than 
itself. He refused, indeed, to recognize the making 
of pentameters and sapphics as the highest of human 
accomplishments, or a false quantity as the unpar- 
donable sin: but by seeking, as he would say, to make 
his teaching dynamical rather than mechanical, he 
found in Latin and Greek exercises the means of 
calling forth power, of cultivating taste and charac- 
ter, right ambition, and interest in great and high 
themes, to all of which he attached more value than 
to the learning of a language per se or to any mere 
information. It is very characteristic of him and of 
his desire to connect the study of the ancient lan- 
guages with the progress of modern thought, that he 
expressed a wish for a cheap edition of Bacon’s 
Instauratio Magna, and thought he could make it 
useful not merely in point of Latinity, “by setting 
fellows to correct the style whenever it was cumbrous

and incorrect,” but also as a means of familiarizing 
boys with the inductive process and with the temper 
of mind in which the achievements of modern science 
could be appreciated. 
like all true..teachers,, from Socrates downwards, 
he relied more on.questioning-than-on-mere.didactics. 
His..whole.method, says Dean Stanley, was. founded 
on the principle 
individ “As a general rule, he never gave 
information except as a kind of reward for an 
answer, and often withheld it altogether or checked 
himself, in the very act of uttering it, from a sense 
that those whom he was addressing had not sufficient 
interest or sympathy to entitle them to receive it. 
His explanations were as short as possible, enough to 
dispose of the difficulty and no more; his questions 
were of a kind to call the attention of the boys to the 
real point of every subject, and to disclose to them 
the exact boundaries of what they knew or did not 
know. With regard to younger boys he said, ‘It is 
a great mistake to think that they should understand 
all they learn; for God has ordered that in youth the 
memory should act vigorously, independent of the 
understanding, whereas a man cannot usually recol- 
lect a thing unless he understands it.’ But in pro- 
portion to their advance in the school he tried to 
cultivate in the boys a habit not only of collecting 
facts, but of expressing themselves with facility, and 
of understanding the principles on which the facts 
rested. ‘You come here,’ he said, ‘not to read, but 
to learn how to read.’ ”?

  GENERAL EDUCATIONAL AIMS 61 
On the whole, the student of “methodology ” who 
searches the life of Arnold for tips and artifices 
whereby classical teaching may be rendered easier 
or more vital is likely to be disappointed. What- 
ever was excellent in the Rugby method of classi- 
cal learning lay rather in the man, and in the spirit 
in which he worked, than in the communicable form 
of newly invented original rules and systems. His 
merit consisted mainly in the fact that he did not 
mistake means for ends; that he kept constantly 
in sight the goal to which all true education should 
be diasted and_that he.sefueed io atiesh unde e=——— portance to conventions and usages which did not help

Ir will thus be seen that Arnold was a faithful 
representative and successor of the school of educa- 
tional theorists who place the “humanities” in the 
foremost place as the staple of liberal culture. He 
may be said to belong to the pre-scientific era of 
educational history. Had he lived to know of the 
marvellous extension of physical science which has 
characterized the subsequent half-century, had he 
followed the researches of Huxley and Darwin and 
Lockyer and Lyell, and recognized the skill with 
which the forces of nature have been investigated 
and turned to account in enlarging the resources of 
human life and happiness, he might in all probability 
have revised his plans and seen the wisdom of recog- 
nizing the claims of natural knowledge as an integral 
part of a scheme of liberal education. He was too 
well acquainted with the Novum Organum, and with 
the spirit of its illustrious author, to disregard the 
new and beautiful knowledge which such studies as 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE 53 
biology, chemistry, and zodlogy have of late brought 
to light. But it may well be doubted whether he 
would ever have regarded any acquaintance with the 
material forces of nature as good substitutes for 
the intellectual culture derived from classical studies, 
or as equal to them in disciplinal value. It is cer- 
tain that he would have rebelled against the view 
put forth by Herbert Spencer in his famous essay, 
“What knowledge is of most worth?” In particu- 
lar he would have been unwilling to admit the claims 
of the physicists to appropriate the name of “sci- 
ence” to their own special department of human 
learning. Science, in its true sense, connotes organ- 
ized systematic knowledge, as distinguished from the 
knowledge of disjointed and unrelated facts. It 
implies insight into reasons, causes, consequences. 
It is not specially concerned with one class of phe- 
nomena, nor with one subject of investigation, but 
pertains alike to all branches of knowledge if treated 
in a philosophic spirit. The nature and significance 
of the Greek aorist, or the laws of the syllogism, 
belong as truly to the domain of science as the pre- 
cession of the equinoxes, or the superposition of 
strata. It is just as possible to teach grammar and 
philology in a scientific way as it is to treat biology 
or the theory of refraction in an unscientific way. 
Even in an elementary school, the teacher who makes 
clear the distinction between the subject and the 
predicate, or between the essential and the non-essen- 
tial parts of a sentence, is as truly a teacher of science 
as he who explains why the water boils, or what are

the respective functions of the heart and lungs. Our 
popular conceptions of the relative value of different 
departments of human knowledge will become clearer 
when the honoured name of “science” shall have come 
to be understood to imply rather a sound method of 
investigating truth than the particular kind of truth 
which is subject to investigation. 
For the present, however, it will suffice to say that 
“science,” in the restricted sense in which we are 
accustomed to use it of late, hardly came into the 
Rugby scheme at all. But language, though the cen- 
tre of that scheme, was not the exclusive subject of 
instruction. Auxiliary to it, and necessary to give 
organic unity to the whole plan, were history, geog- 
raphy, divinity, ethical and political science. And 
of these, history took the foremost place. 
The educational value of history, whether ancient 
or modern, considered as a formative study and a 
legitimate part of academic discipline, has been much 
discussed by teachers and theorists. On the one 
hand, it is contended that the material is unsuited 
for the purpose of such discipline; that the facts 
with which it deals are inexact, unverified, and often 
incapable of verification, and that the sureness and 
precision which should characterize all scholarship 
are unattainable in history. And it is often further 
contended that the subject should not be recognized 
in the curriculum of a school or a university at all, 
but should be left for the voluntary reading of the 
learner. On the other hand, there are those who see 
in the record of past events, and in the accumulated
-P-A-G-E-67

experience of. mankind, the most awakening form of 
intellectual exercise, the best training for citizen- 
ship, and some of the profoundest and most potent 
truths, in their bearing on human conduct and on the 
formation of character. Arnold had no misgivings 
as to the side of the controversy on which he should 
range himself. Coleridge once complained that the 
lessons of history failed to teach us as they might, 
because the light which experience gives is little 
more to us than a lantern on the stern of a ship, 
which illuminates only the waves that are behind us. 
It was precisely against this mistake that Arnold’s 
whole teaching was a practical protest. Freeman’s 
dictum that “History is past politics, and politics 
present history,” was well illustrated in the Rugby 
lessons. The life of the Commonwealth was to him 
the main subject of history; the laws of political sci- 
ence, the main lesson of history; the desire of taking 
an active share in the great work of government, the 
highest earthly desire of the ripened mind.! In the 
interesting Hacursus to be found appended to his 
edition of Thucydides, abundant evidence may be 
seen of the keen interest Arnold felt in tracing the 
analogies between ancient and modern history, and 
of his desire to obtain light from the polity and 
social life of the Greeks and to cast it upon some of 
the complex political problems of our own time. 
1 See the Appendix to the first volume of Thucydides. The whole 
discussion as to the functions and influence of the t¥pavvo: and the 
relation between the aristocracy and the people, is very charac- 
teristic of the spirit in which Arnold gave historical lessons.
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 THOMAS ARNOLD 
His pupils say that he was singularly successful in 
connecting the events recorded by Thucydides and 
Tacitus with parallel incidents in modern history. 
A discussion on the zepioxo: of Athens —not exactly 
citizens, nor yet slaves —leads him to a comparison 
with the burghers of Augsburg, or with the unen- 
franchised commons of England. The steps by which 
the aristocracy of blood becomes in time overthrown 
by the aristocracy of wealth, and by which both may 
be in time superseded by the ascendency of mere 
numbers, he would illustrate in such a way as to 
show the fundamental likeness between some of the 
social and political problems of antiquity and those 
of our own day. Ancient and modern, he always 
contended, were misleading terms. For there was an 
ancient and a modern period in the history of every 
people. “Anda large portion of that history which 
we are wont to call ancient, the later history of the 
Greek republics and that of the period of the Roman 
Empire, is practically modern,— much more modern, 
say, than the age of Alfred, as it describes society in 
a stage analogous to that which we have now reached 
in the history of England.” + 
This view of the essentially modern character of 
much of what is called ancient history, and of the 
practical identity of many of the social and political 
problems which present themselves for solution in 
different ages, is so important and so characteristic 
of Arnold’s method that it needs to be more fully 
vindicated in his own words.

ANCIENT AND MODERN HISTORY 5 
“The state of Greece from Pericles to Alexander, fully 
described to us as it is in the works of their great contem- 
porary historians, poets, orators, and philosophers, affords a 
political lesson perhaps more applicable to our own times, 
if taken altogether, than any other portion of history which 
can be named anterior to the eighteenth century. When 
Thucydides, in his refiection on the bloody dissensions of 
Corcyra, notices the decay and extinction of the simplicity 
of old times, he marks the great transition from ancient his- 
tory to modern, the transition from an age of feeling to one 
of reflection, from a period of ignorance and credulity to one 
of inquiry and scepticism. Now, such a transition took place 
in the sixteenth century ; the period of the Reformation, when 
compared with the years preceding it, was undoubtedly one 
of inquiry and reflection. But still it was an age of strong 
feeling and of intense belief ; the human mind cleared a space 
for itself within a certain circle, but except in individual cases, 
and even those scarcely avowed, there were still acknowledged 
limits of authority, which inquiry had not yet ventured to 
question. The period of Roman civilization from the time 
of the Gracchi to those of the Antonines was in this respect 
more completely modern, and, accordingly, this is one of the 
periods of history we should do well to study most carefully. 
In point of political experience we are, even at this hour, 
scarcely on a level with the statesmen of the age of Alexan- 
der. Mere lapse of years confers here no increase of know- 
ledge ; four thousand years have furnished the Asiatic with 
scarcely anything that deserves the name of political experi- 
ence ; two thousand years since the fall of Carthage have 
furnished the African with absolutely nothing. Even in 
Europe and in America it would not be easy now to collect 
such a treasure of experience as the constitutions of one hun- 
dred and fifty-three commonwealths along the various coasts 
of the Mediterranean offered to Aristotle. There he might 
study the institutions of various races derived from various 
sources: every possible variety of external position, of na-

tional character, of positive laws, agricultural and commer- 
cial, military powers and maritime, wealthy countries and 
poor ones, monarchies, aristocracies, and democracies, with 
every imaginable form and combination of each and all; 
states over-peopled and under-peopled, old and new, and in 
every circumstance of advance, maturity, and decline. Nor 
was the moral experience of the age of Greek civilization 
less complete. By moral experience I mean an acquaintance 
with the whole compass of these questions which relate to 
the metaphysical analysis of man’s nature and faculties, and 
to the practical object of his being. This was derived from 
the strong, critical, and inquiring spirit of the Greek sophists 
and philosophers, and from the unbounded freedom which 
they enjoyed. In mere metaphysical research the schoolmen 
were indefatigable and bold, but in moral questions there 
was an authority which restrained them; among Christians 
the notions of duty and virtue must be assumed as beyond 
dispute. But not the wildest extravagance of atheistic 
wickedness in modern times can go further than the soph- 
ists of Greece went before them; whatever audacity can 
dare and subtilty contrive to make the words ‘good’ and 
‘evil’ change their meaning has been already tried in the 
days of Plato, and by his eloquence and wisdom and faith 
unshaken has been put to shame. Thus it is that while the 
advance of civilization destroys much that was noble, and 
throws over the mass of human society an atmosphere some- 
what dull and hard, yet it is only by its peculiar trials, no 
less than by its positive advantages, that the utmost virtue 
of human nature can be matured. And those who vainly 
lament that progress of earthly things,.which, whether good 
or evil, is certainly inevitable, may be consoled by the thought 
that its sure tendency is to confirm and purify the virtue of 
the good ; and that to us, holding in our hands not the wis- 
dom of Plato only, but also a treasure of wisdom and of com- 
fort which to Plato was denied, the utmost activity of the 
human mind may be viewed without apprehension, in the
-P-A-G-E-71

confidence that we possess a charm to deprive it of its evil, 
and to make it minister for ourselves certainly, and through 
us, if we use it rightly, for the world in general, to the more 
perfect triumph of coi” 
In this long extract, it is evident that the object 
sought in the treatment of history as a school subject 
was not merely the conveyance of information or of 
useful knowledge. Indeed, Arnold thought that the 
favourite notion of filling a learner’s memory with 
useful facts was likely to produce great mischief. 
“Tt was,” he said, “a caricature of the principles of 
inductive philosophy which, while it taught the 
importance of a knowledge of facts, never imagined 
that this knowledge was of itself equivalent to wis- 
dom.” He proposed to begin with younger children 
by giving a few names of the greatest men of differ- 
ent periods, and by presenting to them pictures of his- 
torical scenes so as to form lasting associations with 
the most famous personages in history and the most 
remarkable actions in their lives. He would thus 
familiarize them with the poetry of history, the most 
striking characters and most heroic actions, whether 
of doing or suffering, but would abstain from embar- 
rassing them with its philosophy, with the causes of 
revolutions, the progress of society, or the merits of 
great political questions. 
“Biography would form an essential feature of such a course 
of lessons, partly as giving fixed points of human interest 
round which historical facts would cluster and adjust them- 
1 Preface to the third volume of Thucydides.
-P-A-G-E-72

selves, and partly that in taking up any more detailed history 
or biography (and educators should never forget the impor- 
tance of preparing a boy to derive benefit from his accidental 
reading), he may have some association with the subject of 
it, and may not feel himself on ground wholly unknown to 
him. Supposing that an outline of general history has thus 
been given to a boy by means of pictures and abridgements, 
that his associations, as far as they go, are strong and lively, 
and that a keen desire of knowledge has been awakened, the 
next thing to be done is to set him to read some first-rate his- 
torian whose mind was formed in some period of advanced 
civilization analogous to that in which we now live. Thus 
in time the learner may be introduced to that high philoso- 
phy which helps him “rerum cognoscere causas.” Let him 
be taught to trace back institutions, civil and religious, to 
their origin, to explain the elements of the national character, 
as now exhibited in maturity, in the vicissitudes of a nation’s 
fortune, and the moral and physical qualities of its race, to 
observe how the morals and the mind of the people have been 
subject to a succession of influences, some accidental, others 
regular, to see and remember what critical seasons of improve- 
ment have been neglected, what besetting evils have been 
wantonly aggravated by wickedness and folly. In short, the 
pupil may be furnished, as it were, with certain formule 
which shall enable him to read all history beneficially, shall 
teach him what to look for in it, how to judge of it, and how 
to apply it.” 
In all this we see an illustration of the intellectual 
process which Professor Laurie has called the de- 
parochializing, of the student, the detachment of the 
mind from what is transitory in the politics of the 
present hour, to what is permanent and typical in 
the history of the human race. 
“A man thus educated,” Arnold argued, “even
-P-A-G-E-73
  MORAL PURPOSE IN TEACHING HISTORY 61 
though he knows no history in detail but that which 
is called ancient, will be far better fitted to enter on 
public life than he who could tell the circumstances 
and the date of every battle and of every debate 
throughout the last century, and whose information, 
in the common sense of the term, about modern his- 
tory might be twenty times more minute. The fault 
of systems of classical education in some instances has 
been, not that they did not teach modern history, but 
that they did not prepare and dispose their pupils to 
acquaint themselves with it afterwards; not that they 
did not attempt to raise an impossible superstructure, 
but that they did not prepare the ground for the 
foundation and put the materials within reach of the 
builder. . . . Itisno wisdom to make boys prodigies 
of information, but it is our wisdom and our duty to 
cultivate their faculties each in its season, first the 
memory and imagination, and then the judgment, to 
furnish them with the means, and to excite the desire 
of improving themselves, and to wait with confidence 
for God’s blessing on the result.” 1 
How early it was possible for a young and ingenu- 
ous mind to become impregnated with some of the 
Arnoldian enthusiasm may be judged from this pas- 
sage in one of Arthur Stanley’s letters to his sister, 
written three months after his admission to the 
school. 
“We have been examined again by Dr. Arnold in Latin, 
and he seemed very much pleased with me. He is very par- 
1 Use of the Classics — Arnold’s Miscellaneous Works, p. 359.

  62 THOMAS ARNOLD 
ticular. The least word you say or pronounce wrong he finds 
out in an instant, and he is very particular about chronology, 
history, and geography. He does not sit still like the other 
masters, but walks backwards and forwards all the time, and 
seems rather fidgety. Only a fortnight to Easter and the 
speeches. There are to be English verses. How I shall 
listen! ... How particular he is, but at the same time 
so mild and pleasant. I like saying to him very much. He 
asks much about history, and puts queer, out-of-the-way ques- 
tions. I daresay you will be glad to hear that I got up to 
the top place for answering something about Themistocles. 
He seems very much pleased when I answer anything.” 
The boy goes on to tell also how he has again seen 
Mrs. Arnold, and how “she talked to me about her 
children, and told me that little Matthew, the eldest 
of her boys, that morning had been in the garden, 
and got ‘a red and white rose for her, and showing 
them to the Doctor, said, ‘See, Papa, here are York 
and Lancaster.’ It so happened that that very day 
the lesson with Dr. Arnold was history, and though 
there was nothing particular about it in the lesson, 
he asked a good deal about the devices of York and 
Lancaster. I daresay he was thinking about Matt 
and his roses.” ? 
Incidentally, an interesting side light is thrown on 
his method of teaching by the method adopted in his 
Roman history. He had been profoundly impressed 
by the researches of Niebuhr into the earlier annals 
of Rome, and he regarded that writer as one who, by 
the method no less than by the results of his enqui- 
1 Life of Dean Stanley, Vol. I.
-P-A-G-E-75
  
ROME UNDER THE KINGS 63 
ries, had done for ancient history what Bacon did for 
science. Indeed, it may be said that this author’s 
works exercised a singularly profound influence on 
Arnold’s character, since they not only inspired him 
with new views of historical criticism, but by introduc- 
ing him to German literature, opened out to him new 
realms of thought. With a view to make the result of 
Niebuhr’s researches intelligible to English readers, 
he determined to set forth the legendary story of the 
first three centuries of the regal period of Rome in a 
manner likely to call special attention to its unhis- 
torical and quasi-mythical character. Like all true 
teachers, he knew that truth of mere fact, — definite, 
verifiable truth, is not the only kind of truth worth 
studying. What actually happened about the begin- 
nings of Rome, whether Aineas and Romulus ever 
lived, and what they did, are matters undoubtedly 
worth knowing if we can find them out. But what 
the Romans believed about the origin of their city is 
equally well worth knowing, for it helped to shape 
the polity of the Roman commonwealth, to form the 
national character, and to influence Roman literature. 
It is therefore as true a subject for the historian, and 
has exercised as great an influence on the fortunes 
and development of the human race as any dates and 
records which will satisfy the historical critic. It 
might be contended that the like argument would 
justify the historians of our own country in setting 
forth the legends of Brutus the Trojan, of Lear, and 
of Pendragon, as they are told by Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth, Gildas, or Nennius, or later by Milton him-
-P-A-G-E-76

self in his curious fragment of British history. But 
it is manifest that the same reasons do not apply, 
and that, interesting as these legends are, and fruitful 
as they have been found by our poets, from Shake- 
speare to Tennyson, they have never been incorporated 
in the popular belief, as the traditions of the prehis- 
toric age of Rome had been. It was, however, very 
characteristic of Arnold that he was unwilling to 
dismiss these traditions as irrelevant and wholly 
unhistorical, but that he sought rather to find for 
them their due place in the narrative with a kind of 
authenticity all their own. “I wished,” he said in 
his preface to the Roman history, “to give these 
legends with the best effect, and at the same time 
with a perpetual mark, not to be mistaken by the 
most careless reader, that they were legends and not 
history. There seemed a reason, therefore, for adopt- 
ing a more antiquated style, which otherwise, of 
course, would be justly liable to the charge of affec- 
tation.” Most readers of his Roman history will be 
ready to acknowledge that this aim has been well 
fulfilled. The author has succeeded in adding a new 
charm to the story of Romulus and Numa, and has 
invested with the hues of poetry the beautiful legend 
of the nymph Egeria, who “in her sacred grove and 
by the spring that welled out of the rock taught the 
good king all that he ought to do towards the gods 
and towards men.” It is pleasant thus to have the 
old-world stories of the statesman-like Servius and 
the wicked Tullia, the Sibylline books, the Delphic 
oracle, and the expulsion of the Tarquins told with
-P-A-G-E-77
  
HISTORICAL SYMPATHIES AND ANTIPATHIES 65 
simplicity in archaic and semi-Biblical language, 
while all the critical apparatus and discussion of 
their historical trustworthiness are appropriately re- 
served for separate treatment. One obtains, as this 
book is read, a glimpse of the method by which a 
teacher might vivify history and make it real and 
edifying to a nineteenth century learner, without 
robbing it of that nuance of poetry which makes the 
twilight of history so full of pathetic beauty. 
And hence we are not surprised to learn that his- 
tory as he treated it became a favourite subject with 
the boys. A schoolmaster who has no hobby, no 
subject which he teaches with special sympathy and 
with contagious enthusiasm, loses a great opportunity 
of influence. And it was soon perceived that his 
favourite books and periods the boys read zealously, 
and that his favourite heroes were theirs. The char- 
acters and thoughts of antiquity were to him and to 
them alike almost living and present. “A black 
cloud was on his brow when he spoke of Tiberius or 
Augustus or Napoleon, of the soulless Epicureanism 
of Horace or the coarseness of Juvenal; and few of 
his pupils have lost his enthusiasm for the often mis- 
represented and vilified Cicero, or for the best and 
holiest of kings, St. Louis of France. He denounced 
Polybius as a dull geographer and an overrated mili- 
tary historian, and Livy as a drunken helot, showing 
us what history ought not to be, and so uniformly 
careless as to make the Punic war as hard in the 
telling, as it was in the fighting.” Thus, as Mr, Oscar 
Browning says: 
EF
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“ Arnold’s deep interest in history, his grasp of all that 
was living and actual in the authors which he taught, were 
the springs of a literary stimulus, the effects of which fre- 
quently lasted through life. After reading St. Paul’s denun- 
ciations of the sins of the heathen, he would turn to his 
Horace and say, ‘Let us now see what this ancient world 
was like.’” 
As an adjunct to history he attached special value 
to geography. The physical features of a country 
must be studied before the events which took place 
in it can be explained. As a topographical map is 
indispensable to the commander who undertakes a 
campaign, it is not less useful to one who wishes to 
understand the history of such a campaign. Carlyle 
did not undertake to describe the battle of Dunbar or 
of Rossbach until he had visited the spot and studied 
the conformation of the ground; and in like manner 
Arnold followed and traced with care the footsteps of 
Hannibal over the Alps. That Ostia in the time of 
Ancus Martius was at the mouth of the Tiber, though 
now seven miles from the sea, that Ravenna, in the 
time of Theodoric, was one of the most famous cities 
of Italy, though now, owing to the physical changes 
of the shore, an obscure and pestilential town, and 
that Rome itself owes its growth to its fortunate 
position in the midst of a large area of productive 
territory, were facts which seemed to him to have a 
significant bearing on the course of history. 
“T have been working at Hannibal’s passage of the Alps.

should be thought a good one! Compare him with any man

who is really a geographer, — with Herodotus, with Napo- 
leon, whose sketches of Italy, Egypt, and Syria, in his 
memoirs are unrivalled, — or with Niebuhr, and how strik- 
ing is the difference. The dulness of Polybius’s fancy made 
it impossible for him to conceive or paint scenery clearly, 
and how can a man be a geographer without lively images 
of the formation and features of the country which he 
describes? How different are the several Alpine valleys, 
and how would a few simple touches of the scenery which 
he seems actually to have visited, yet could neither under- 
stand nor feel it, have decided for ever the question of the 
route. Vow the account suits no valley well, and therefore 
it may be applied to many; but I believe the real line was 
by the little St. Bernard, although I cannot trace the par- 
ticular spots which De Luc and Cramer fancy they could 
recognise. I thought so on the spot (¢.e. that the route 
could not be traced) when I crossed the little St. Bernard 
with Polybius in my hand, and I think so still. How much 
we want a physical history of countries, tracing the changes 
they have undergone, either by such violent revolutions as 
volcanic phenomena, or by the slower but not less complete 
change produced by ordinary causes: such as alteration of 
climate occasioned by enclosing and draining, alteration in the 
course of rivers, and in the level of their beds, alteration in 
the animal and vegetable productions of the soil, and in the 
supply of metals and minerals, noting also the advance or 
retreat of the sea, and the origin and successive increase in 
the number and variation in the line of roads, together with 
the changes in the extent and character of the woodlands. 
How much might be done by our society at Rome if some 
of its attention were directed to these points; for instance, 
drainage and an alteration in the course of the waters have 
produced great changes in Tuscany, and there is also the 
interesting question as to the spread of malaria in the 
Maremma,” *

Dean Stanley gives another example of the way in 
which Arnold would vivify his lessons by associating 
geography and history. 
“In the Seven Years’ War he would illustrate the gen- 
eral connexion of military history with geography by the 
simple instance of the order of Hannibal’s successive vic- 
tories, and then chalking roughly on a board the chief points 
in the physical conformation of Germany, apply the same 
principle to the more complicated campaigns of Frederick 
the Great. Or again in a more general examination he 
would ask for the chief events which occurred, for instance, 
in the year 15, of two or three successive centuries, and 
by making the boys contrast or compare them together, 
bring before their minds the differences and resemblances 
in the state of Europe in each of the periods in question.” 
This passage is interesting as a revelation of one 
conspicuous note or characteristic of Arnold’s teach- 
ing —its thoroughness. The truly effective teacher 
must not only know his subject or his text-book, he 
must look all round it, must survey from all sides 
the problem he has to solve and must furnish himself 
with such auxiliary information as may help him 
to illustrate the matter in hand from very differ- 
ent points of view. Arnold saw the necessity of 
widening the school curriculum, of giving to mathe- 
matics, modern languages, and even to rudimentary 
science increased attention and importance; but his 
own personal teaching was mainly confined, as we 
have seen, to divinity, language, literature, and 
to history, and to so much of geography as would 
make history and literature intelligible. Within that
-P-A-G-E-81
  RELATION OF HEAD MASTER TO ASSISTANTS 69 
range nothing which had even an indirect bearing on 
the elucidation of the subject seemed to him unim- 
portant or irrelevant. But outside this range, he 
habitually deferred to the judgment of others. When 
a boy brought him a question he was unable to 
answer, he would say frankly, “Go to Mr. Price,” or 
perhaps some other assistant, “he knows more about 
it than Ido.” That affectation of omniscience which 
some teachers deem necessary for the maintenance of 
dignity seemed petty and unworthy in his eyes; and 
one of the lessons the boys learned from him was 
that one should have the courage to admit ignorance 
of many things, and that it was a mean thing to pre- 
tend to know that of which we are actually ignorant. 
His views as to the right relation of a head master 
to his colleagues are well illustrated in these two 
extracts from letters, the first being one of enquiry 
for a master. 
“What I want is a man who is a Christian and a gentle- 
man — an active man, and one who has common sense and 
understands boys. I do not so much care about scholarship, 
as he will have immediately under him the lowest forms in 
the school ; but yet, on second thoughts, I do care about it 
very much, because his pupils may be in the highest forms ; 
and besides, I think that even the elements are best taught 
by a man who has a thorough knowledge of the matter. 
However, if one must give way, I prefer activity of mind, 
and an interest in his work, to high scholarship, for the one 
can be acquired more easily than the other.” 
In a letter addressed to a new master on his ap- 
pointment, he amplifies this theme, and presents to us 
a picture of an ideal assistant.
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 ? THOMAS ARNOLD 
“The qualifications which I deem essential to the due per- 
formance of a master’s duties here may in brief be expressed 
as the spirit of a Christian and a gentleman — that a man 
should enter upon his business not €x zapépyov, but as of 
substantive and most important duty ; that he should devote 
himself to it as the especial branch of the ministerial calling 
which he has chosen to follow; that belonging to a great 
public institution, and sharing in a public and conspicuous 
situation, he should study things ‘lovely and of good 
report’; that is, that he should be public-spirited, liberal, 
and entering heartily into the interest, honour, and general 
respectability and distinction of the society that he has 
joined, and that he should have suflicient vigour of mind, 
and thirst for knowledge, to persist in adding to his own 
stores, without neglecting the full improvement of those 
whom he is teaching. I think our masterships here offer 
a noble field of duty; and I would not bestow these on 
any one who I thought would undertake them without 
entering into the spirit of our system heart and hand.”? 
In short, his aim was first to surround himself with 
men worthy of trust, and then to trust them. Every 
three weeks a council was held, in which all school 
matters were discussed, and in which every one was 
free to express his opinion or propose any measure 
not in contradiction to any fundamental principle of 
school administration, and it not unfrequently hap- 
pened that he himself was opposed and out-voted. 
He tried to strengthen the bonds which united the 
masters and the school, and their loyalty to one 
another, by offering in various ways means for 
friendly communication between them. He desired, 
1 Stanley, Chap. III. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
THE IDEAL SCHOOL 71 
also, that the masters should have “each a horse of 
his own to ride,” independent of the mere phantas- 
magoria of boys passing successively through their 
respective forms. He had learned from experience 
how much his own mental horizon and his power of 
usefulness had been enlarged by the indulgence of 
intellectual hobbies not directly connected with the 
necessary routine of school work ; and when he dis- 
covered any special gift or taste on the part of a 
young master, he sought to find an opportunity for 
its exercise. A weak head master seeks to be an 
autocrat, and is fain to lay down mechanical rules 
with a view to secure that all his assistants shall 
conform to his pattern and his methods. It is only a 
strong man who can afford to encourage freedom and 
reasonable independence among his subordinates, and 
thus to secure their hearty co-operation. Yet with- 
out such freedom there will always be waste of 
power; the school will lack organic unity, and will 
fail to achieve its highest purposes. 
Thus the ideal ever before the head master’s mind 
was not that of a school in which it was the business 
of some to teach and others to learn, and in which 
the functions of the various members were clearly 
separated and defined, but an organized community 
for mutual help in the business both of teaching and 
learning. Education, he was wont to say, is not a 
mechanical but a dynamical process, and the more 
powerful and vigorous the mind of the teacher, the 
more clearly and readily he can grasp things, the 
better fitted he is to cultivate the mind of another.
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“And to this I find myself coming more and more. 
I care less and less for information, more and more 
for the pure exercise of the mind, for answering a 
question concisely and comprehensively, for showing 
a command of language, delicacy of taste, a compre- 
hensiveness of thought, and power of combination.” ? 
The relations of a head master to a governing body 
are among the most difficult and delicate concern- 
ments of his life. The right of governors and trus- 
tees to control the general administration of the 
school and of its funds is undoubted; and deference, 
courtesy, and full information are their due from the 
master to whom they have confided the actual internal 
government of the school. But in Arnold’s view the 
delimitation of power and responsibility should be 
very clearly marked. Fuller has said of the good 
schoolmaster, that “he is and will be known to be an 
absolute monarch in his school.” And this is indeed 
the only condition on which a high-minded man, con- 
scious of power and of a clear purpose, could accept 
a head-mastership. The trustees have always their 
remedy. They may dismiss, without assigning cause, 
a master in whom, for any reason, they have ceased 
to have confidence. But until they do so, his author- 
ity is absolute. While seeking, therefore, to culti- 
vate the most friendly relations with the trustees, 
Arnold was very resolute in regard to the rights and 
privileges of his office. And when on the appearance 
of an article in the Edinburgh Review, which was 
generally and rightly attributed to him, an influential

  RELATION OF HEAD MASTER TO GOVERNORS 73 
  governor of the school wrote to ask him if he were 
the author, he replied without hesitation. The let- 
ters following have in fact established a precedent of 
which many later teachers have availed themselves 
for their own protection against interference within , 
the sphere of their own lawful freedom and respon- | 
sibility. Earl Howe wrote to him requesting, as one | 
of the trustees of Rugby School, that’Dr. Arnold : 
would declare if he was the author of the article | 
on Dr. Hampden in the Edinburgh Review, and | 
stating that his conduct would be guided by Dr. ! 
Arnold’s answer. | 
“ Ruesy, June 22, 1836. 
“My Lorp, — 
“The answer which your Lordship has asked for I have 
given several times to many of my friends; and I am well 
known to be very little apt to disavow or conceal my author- 
ship of anything that I may at any time have written. 
Still, as I conceive your Lordship’s question to be one which . 
none but a personal friend has the slightest right to put to 
me, or to any man, I feel it due to myself to decline giving 
any answer to it.” 
In reply to a second letter in which Lord Howe | 
urged compliance with his request, on the grounds that | 
he might feel constrained by official duty to take | 
some step in the matter in case the report were true, | 
Arnold says: 
“Your Lordship addressed me in a tone purely formal and | 
official, and at the same time asked a question which the | 
common usage of society regards as one of delicacy — justi- 
fied I do not say, only by personal friendship, but at least .

by some familiarity of acquaintance. It was because no 
such ground could exist in the present case, and because I 
cannot and do not acknowledge your right officially as a 
trustee of Rugby School, to question me on the subject of 
my real or supposed writings on matters wholly unconnected 
with the school, that I felt it my duty to decline answering 
your Lordship’s question. 
“Tt is very painful to be placed in a situation where I 
must either appear to seek concealment wholly foreign to 
my wishes, or else must acknowledge a right which I owe 
it, not only to myself, but to the master of every endowed 
school in England, absolutely to deny. But in the present 
case, I think I can hardly be suspected of seeking conceal- 
ment. I have spoken on the subject of the article in the 
Edinburgh Review, freely, in the hearing of many, with no 
request for secrecy, on their part, expressed or implied. 
Officially, however, I cannot return an answer, not from the 
slightest feeling of disrespect to your Lordship, but because 
my answering would allow a principle which I can, on no 
account, admit to be just or reasonable.”

ArRnotp’s fame, however, rests more largely on his 
work as a ruler and administrator, than on his special 
mor: ich, as he himself 
desired, his influence was most strongly felt. He had 
from the first an oppressive sense of the formidable 
character of the task he had undertaken; of the vast 
capacity for evil which lay yet undeveloped in a crowd 
of young, high-spirited, lawless lads; and yet of the 
boundless possibilities of good which were there also. 
“The management of boys,” he said, “has all the in- 
terest of a great game of chess with living creatures 
for pawns and pieces, and your adversary in plain 
English the devil, who truly plays a tough game and 
is very hard to beat.” It is a familiar fact in the ex- 
perience of teachers that the interval between child- 
hood and manhood is a somewhat intractable period ; 
—a state of transition wherein the several elements of 
75
-P-A-G-E-88
y

our composite nature exist for the time in unfavour- 
able proportions. The shepherd’s wish in the Win- 
ter’s Tale, “I would there were no age between ten 
and three and twenty, or that youth would sleep out 
the rest,” has found an echo in the thoughts of many 
a schoolmaster. Boys, however, decline to go to sleep 
from ten years old till twenty-three. They are in fact 
very much alive, and Arnold was sometimes appalled 
at the task he had undertaken. When he went to 
Rugby, the state of morals and behaviour was emi- 
nently disheartening; drunkenness and swearing were 
common vices; a reckless defiance of authority, and a 
hatred of submission to it, were combined with a servile 
cringing to the public opinion of the school. There 
was great readiness to combine for evil, and a system- 
atic persecution carried on by the bad against the good. 
Dr. Moberly, head master of Winchester, and after- 
wards Bishop of Salisbury, says that “the tone of 
young men who came up to the University from Win- 
chester, Eton, Rugby, or Harrow, was universally 
irreligious. A religious undergraduate was very rare, 
and was much laughed at when he appeared.” 
An outspoken passage from one of Arnold’s school 
sermons shows how true a diagnosis he had made of 
the evils he had to encounter, and how deep was his 
sense of the dangers and pitfalls which surround life 
in a great public school. 
“What the aspect of public schools is when viewed with 
a Christian eye, and what are the feelings with which men 
who do really turn to God in after life look back upon 
their years passed at school, I cannot express better than in
-P-A-G-E-89
  MORAL EVILS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 77 
the words of one! who had himself been at a public school, 
who afterwards became a most exemplary Christian, and 
who in what I am going to quote seems to describe his own 
experience. ‘Public schools,’ he says, ‘are the very seats 
and nurseries of vice. It may be unavoidable, or it may not, 
but the fact is indisputable. None can pass through a 
large school without being pretty intimately acquainted with 
vice, and few, alas! very few, without tasting too largely of 
that poisoned bowl. The hour of grace and repentance 
at length arrives, and they are astonished at their former 
fatuity. ... 
“T am afraid,” Arnold goes on to say, “that the fact is 
indeed indisputable. Public schools are the very seats and 
nurseries of vice. But the same writer says further, ‘It 
may be unavoidable, or it may not,’ and these words seem 
to me as though they ought to fill us with the deepest shame 
of all. For what a notion does it give that we should have 
been so long and constantly bad that it may be doubted 
whether our badness be not unavoidable, whether we are not 
evil hopelessly and incurably. And this to be true of places 
which were intended to be seats of Christian education, and 
in all of which, I believe, the same words are used in the 
daily prayers which we use regularly here! God is thanked 
for those founders and benefactors by whose benefits the 
whole school is brought up to godliness and good learn- 
ing! ... What is meant when public schools are called 
‘the seats and nurseries of vice’? That is properly a nurs- 
ery of vice where a boy unlearns the pure and honest prin- 
ciples which he may have received at home, and gets in their 
stead others which are utterly low and base and mischievous, 
where he loses his modesty, his respect for truth, and his 
affectionateness, and becomes coarse and false and unfeeling. 
That, too, is a nursery of vice, and most fearfully so, where 
vice is bold and forward and presuming, and goodness is 
1Mr. John Bowdler, Remains, Vol. IL., p. 153.
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 THOMAS ARNOLD 
timid and shy, and exists as if by sufferance; where the 
good, instead of setting the tone of society and branding 
with disgrace those who disregard it, are themselves exposed 
to reproach for their goodness, and shrink before the open 
avowal of evil principles which the bad are striving to make 
the law of the community. That is a nursery of vice where 
the restraints laid upon evil are considered as so much taken 
from liberty, and where, generally speaking, evil is more 
willingly screened and concealed than detected and punished. 
What society would be if men regarded the laws of God and 
man as a grievance, and thought liberty consisted in follow- 
ing to the full their proud and selfish and low inclinations, 
that schools to a great extent are, and therefore they may 
be well called ‘the seats and nurseries of vice.’”? 
The peculiar conditions which help to determine the 
public opinion of a great school have been described 
with much vividness and clearness of insight, by a 
later head master of large and varied experience. 
“The modern bed of Procrustes, is, or was, a public 
school. Nowhere in the world is there so keen an appre- 
ciation of those who adapt themselves to local tone, temper, 
and custom. But nowhere is departure, however slight, 
from the recognized standard of propriety visited with 
consequences so unfailing. The society of a public school 
is a world in itself, self-centred, self-satisfied. It takes but 
slight account of the principles and practices which obtain in 
the world of men. It has its own laws, its own fashions, 
its own accepted code of morals. To these all persons must 
submit, or the penalty of resistance is heavy. Its virtues 
are not altogether those of men and women, nor are its 
vices. Some actions of which the world thinks compara- 
tively little, it honours with profound admiration. To 
1 Sermon XIL., Vol. 2.

  DANGERS OF SCHOOL-BOY LIFE 7 
others which the world thinks much of, it is indifferent. 
There, physical courage, for instance, is esteemed too highly. 
Self-repression is depreciated. Hypocrisy is loathed. But 
the inverted hypocrisy — the homage which virtue pays te 
vice —or, in other words, the affectation of being worse 
than one really is, is common among boys, and is thought 
to be honourable. Truth, again, is not esteemed as a virtue 
of universal application, but is relative to particular persons, 
a falsehood, if told to a schoolfellow, being worse than if 
told to a master. Nobody can be intimate with a com- 
munity of schoolboys and not feel that a morality so abso- 
lute, yet so narrow, and in some ways so perverted, bears a 
certain resemblance to the morality of a savage tribe. It 
is rather the germ of morals, than morality itself... . 
‘What may be called the uncivilized or unsoftened spirit in 
public school life is seen in the homage paid among public- 
school boys to physical faculties and performances. Of the 
achievements of the intellect, if they stand alone, public- 
school opinion is still, as it has always been, slightly con- 
temptuous. But strength, speed, athletic skill, quickness 
of eye and hand, still command universal applause among 
schoolboys, as among savages.” * 
How Arnold sought to meet the ‘difficulties of the 
task before him, and by what expedients he endeay- 
oured to clear the moral atmosphere of the school, and 
to set up by degrees a higher standard both of aim and 
achievement in school-boy life, cannot be fully under- 
stood without acquaintance with the fuller details 
which are given in Stanley’s Life. It may suffice here 
to enumerate them briefly. The steps he took in the 
way of reform were, even when dest and most reso- 
ute, cautious and tentative. e to

know that a new head master who insists at once on 
measures of reform which appear to his colleagues 
and to the older boys to be needless and revolu- 
tionary, may defeat his own purpose by creating the 
friction and opposition a little tact might render un- 
necessary. His first duty is to accept and turn to use 
whatever of good iene is in the existing system, oy 
ence enables him to make/sure of his “ground. For 
example, he made no         
   
  fon. nother system,” he said, “might perhaps be 
Detter than this, but I am placed here in the midst of 
this one and must make the best of it.” So he first 
sought and won th i form, told 
them frankly that he regarded them as invested with 
“want you to feel,”"he used to say to them, “how enor- 
mous is the influence you possess here on all below 
you.” Nothing seemed to him of so much importance 
as to secure a body of prepostors distinguished by 
high principle, gentlemanly conduct, and intellectual 
ability. “You should feel,” he told them, “like offi- 
cers in the army whose want of moral courage would 
be thought cowardice. When I have confidence in 
the sixth, there is no post in England for which I 
would peblentee this; but if they do not support me, I 
must go.” He believed that one way of making a boy 
a_gentleman was to treat him as one, and to show that 
he was respected and trusted. ven in the lower part 
of the school he never seemed on the watch for boys, 
    
-P-A-G-E-93
  MORAL DISCIPLINE 81 
    ie Sitar education present to our 
vtew no eminent teacher who was more profoundly 
penetrated than Arnold with the need of a moral 
basis for all school work. Aristotle had taught him 
that in advancing towards ideal perfection, the im- 
provement of the moral faculties should go on con- 
currently with the development of intellectual powers. 
Hence he never ceased to insist on the paramount im- 
portance of training as distinguished from teaching. 
Every evil habit conquered, and every good habit 
formed, he knew would remove one obstacle to the 
energy of the intellect and assist in invigorating its 
nature. He thought that few spectacles were more 
appalling than that of a youth of high mental gifts 
divorced from moral principle. 
When habits of self-indulgence and lawlessness 
have become so confirmed in a community of high- 
spirited youths as to be part of its traditions, rapid 
and drastic reform is practically impossible, and 
it would be dangerous and Quixotic for a master 
to attempt it. It was thereforé by degrees that 
Arnold sought to remove the worst and most ob- 
stinate of these usages. For example, the prac- 
tice of keeping beagles and guns surreptitiously 
in the back premises of the boarding-houses was 
G
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 THOMAS ARNOLD 
effectually stopped, not by a peremptory prohibition, 
but by simply ruling that houses in which they 
were kept should be held to be out of the school 
bounds,—a rule which practically involved some- 
thing like financial ruin to the house-master unless a 
change were made. It was more difficult to deal with 
the sporting section of the elder boys, who were wont 
to hire horses at Dunchurch, three miles off, in the 
heart of a famous hunting country, and to indulge in 
steeplechase and other races. Mr. Hughes tells of 
one such race which excited so much animation and 
enthusiasm among the boys that they resolved to 
have another, and made all arrangements with jockeys 
and umpires for a longer race across country. It 
was commonly said of Arnold that he knew better 
than any one when to look, and when to see nothing. 
However, it was expected in this case that there 
would be a “row,” and that he would publicly notice 
the breach of rule which had been committed, and 
forbid its intended repetition. Nothing, however, 
was publicly said; but in the evening the chief of 
the sportsmen, a promising sixth-form youth, was sent 
for, and the Doctor said: “I know all about the 
match you rode the other day. If I had taken any 
public notice of it, I must have expelled you pub- 
licly. This would have ruined your career at Oxford, 
where you have just matriculated, and I hope will 
do well. But I have written to your father to tell 
him of your flagrant breach of discipline. And now 
let me warn you and your friends. I know what 
you are intending, and I will expel every boy who
-P-A-G-E-95
  
EXPULSION 83 
rides or is present, and will have the road watched to 
get the names.” Mr. Hughes adds, “That race did 
not come off, or any other during Arnold’s time.” 
That boys should wish to see a race he thought 
reasonable enough; and a few weeks afterwards, 
when there was a grand steeplechase at Dunchurch, 
we find Clough writing to Arthur Stanley, “ Arnold 
very wisely and indulgently altered the hour of call- 
ing over, and took off the Dunchurch prohibition for 
the day, so at least nine-tenths of the school were 
present to see the sport.” ? 
Again, he resolutely expelled a boy whose influence 
tended to degrade the public opinion of the school or 
to be seriously detrimental to his companions. There 
were few points on which he was more emphatic and 
determined than this. “Undoubtedly it would be 
better if there was no evil, but evil being unavoid- 
able, we are not a jail to keep it in, but a place of 
education where we must cast it out, to prevent its 
taint from spreading.” Again, “If a boy has set his 
mind to do nothing, but considers all the work here 
as so much fudge, which he will evade if he can, he 
is sure to corrupt the rest, and I will send him away 
without seruple.” Such a course necessarily proved 
unpopular, and brought about at first a good deal of 
remonstrance from parents and muttered discontent 
among the boys. They were scared and silenced, 
however, when he broke out one day with the oft- 
quoted allocution: “It is not necessary that this 
should be a school for three hundred, or even one

84 THOMAS ARNOLD 
hundred, boys, but it is necessary that it should be a 
school of Christian gentlemen.” Those who have seen 
in the National Portrait Gallery in London the ad- 
mirable portrait of Arnold by Phillips, and have 
marked the keen eye, the firm and resolute mouth, 
and the masterful pose of the head will easily under- 
stand the tone in which he would utter these words 
and the rather startling effect which they produced. 
Yet it is noticeable that although his great aim 
was to give a Christian tone to the little community, 
he did not set about increasing the number of reli- 
gious services or theological lessons, or rely for the 
fulfilment of his ideal on what is often described as 
definite dogmatic teaching. “He shrank,” says Stan- 
ley, “from pressing on the conscience of boys rules 
of action which he felt they were not yet able to 
bear, and from enforcing acts which, though right 
in themselves, would in boys be performed from 
wrong motives.” 
The school chapel became, w      
at-Rugby as well as a head master, but three years 
after Arnold’s appointment the former office fell 
vacant, and he applied to the trustees for the ap- 
pointment without the salary. The use he made of 
his new office will be fully appreciated by all who 
read the published volumes containing the sermons 
preached in Rugby chapel. Arthur Stanley, at the 
age of eighteen, said of Arnold’s sermons that he 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  SCHOOL SERMONS 85 
never heard or saw anything which gave him so 
strongly the idea of inspiration. The prevailing 
note of these sermons is intense seriousness,—a deep 
sense both of the need of a high ideal in life and 
of the difficulties which attend its realization. His 
conception of the purpose which a school sermon 
ought to serve is well illustrated in this passage: 
“Tt is not enough to speak of sin in general and holiness 
in general, of God and Christ, of death and judgement. Some- 
thing more clear and distinct is wanted. You know very 
well that your faults are not those which you read of most 
in books, for books are written by men, and in general are 
intended to be read by men; they speak therefore mostly of 
the sins and temptations of manhood: of covetousness, ambi- 
tion, injustice, pride, and other older vices with which you 
feel that you have as yet but small concern. Besides, the 
pulpit is a solemn and sacred place, whereas the matters 
with which you are daily engaged are so common and so 
humble, that it seems like a want of reverence to speak of 
them in a sermon plainly by their names. And yet, if we 
do not speak of them plainly by their names, half of what 
we say will be lost in the air.”? 
Accordingly, we find throughout the sermons evi- 
dence of a full acquaintance with the peculiar temp- 
tations which school life presents, and a keen insight 
int on the character.

“There are boys who have either never learned, or have 
quite forgotten all that may have been told them at home, 
of the duty of attending to their school lessons. We know 
that there are boys who think all their lessons merely tire- 
some, and who are resolved never to take any more trouble 
about them than they can possibly avoid. But being thus 
idle themselves they cannot bear that others should be more 
attentive. We all know the terms of reproach and ridicule 
which are thrown out against a boy who works in earnest 
and upon principle. He is laughed at for taking unnecessary 
trouble, for being afraid of punishment, or for wishing to gain 
favour with his masters, and be thought by them to be better 
than other boys. Either of these reproaches is one which a 
boy finds it very hard to bear; he does not like to be thought 
afraid, or as wishing to court favour. He has not age or 
sense or firmness enough to know, that the only fear of which 
he needs be ashamed is the fear of his equals, the fear of 
those who are in no respect better than himself, and have, 
therefore, no right to direct him. To be afraid then of other 
boys is, in a boy, the same sort of weakness as it is in a man 
to be afraid of other men, and as a man ought to be equally 
ashamed of fearing men and of not fearing God, so a boy 
ought to be ashamed of fearing boys, and also to be ashamed 
of not fearing his parents and instructors. And as in after 
life, the fear of God makes no man do anything mean or 
dishonourable, but the fear of men does lead to all sorts of 
weakness and baseness, so among boys the fear of their parents 
and teachers will only make them manly and noble and high- 
spirited, but the fear of their companions leads them to be 
everything low and childish and contemptible.”

  MORAL COWARDICE 87 
“There are some boys who, remembering the wishes of their 
parents, are extremely unwilling to incur debts and to spend 
a great deal of money upon their own eating, drinking, and 
amusements. There are some, too, who, knowing that the 
use of wine or any liquor of that sort is forbidden, because 
the use of it among boys is sure to be the abuse of it, would 
not indulge in anything of the kind themselves. But they 
are assailed by the example and the reproaches and the 
laughter of others. It is mean and poor-spirited and ungen- 
erous not to contribute to the pleasures and social enjoyments 
of their companions ; in short, not to do as others do. The 
charge of stinginess, of not spending his money liberally, is 
one which a boy is particularly sore at hearing. He forgets 
that in his case such a charge is the greatest possible folly. 
Where is the generosity of spending money which is not your 
own, and which, as soon as it is spent, is to be supplied again 
with no sacrifice on your part? Where is the stinginess of 
not choosing to beg money of your dearest friends in order 
to employ it in a manner which those friends would disap- 
prove? For after all the money must come from them, as 
you have it not, nor can you earn it for yourselves. But 
there is another laugh behind ; a boy is laughed at for being 
kept so strictly at home that he cannot get money as he 
likes, and he is taught to feel ashamed and angry at the hard 
restraint which is laid upon him. Truly that boy has gone 
a good way in the devil’s service, who will dare to set an- 
other against his father and mother, and who will teach him 
that their care and authority are things which he should be 
ashamed of.” ? 
His perception of the evils and dangers which 
attended public-school life will thus be seen to have 
been very keen, yet his biographer tells us that there 
was hardly ever a sermon which did not contain some 
1 Sermon VIIL, p. 71.
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 THOMAS ARNOLD 
words of encouragement. “I have never,” he said in 
his last sermon, “wished to speak with exaggeration; 
it seems to me as unwise as it is wrong todoso. I 
think that it is quite right to observe what is hopeful 
in us as well as what is threatening. General con- 
fessions of unmixed evils are deceiving and hardening 
rather than arousing, and our evil never looks so 
really dark as when we contrast it with anything 
which there may be in us of good.”? 
Although by his own early training, and by the 
necessities of his position as head master of Rugby, 
he was essentially a “public-school” man, identified 
with the system of great boarding-schools, he was not 
insensible to the disadvantages of that system, not 
the least of which was the alienation of the boys 
from home influence. In his view the ideal method 
of education was a combination of the home and the 
school, and he thought it a misfortune to a boy to be 
handed over for so large a portion of his young life 
to the care of strangers, in an artificial community, 
in which the domestic affections, which ought ever to 
exercise so large a share in the formation of a noble 
character, were necessarily overlaid or discouraged. 
“You sometimes,” he said, “learn to feel ashamed of in- 
dulging your natural affections, and particularly of being 
attached to your mothers and sisters, and fond of their 
society. You fancy it is unmanly to be thought to have 
been influenced by them, and you are afraid of being sup- 
posed to long too much for their tenderness and indulgent

  HOME INFLUENCE 89 
kindness towards you. ... I am afraid, it cannot be 
doubted, that it is peculiarly the effect of the public schools 
of England to lower and weaken the connexion between 
parent and child, to lessen mutual confidence, and to make 
a son regard his father with more of respect than of love. 
Certainly, at least, the relation in other countries of Europe 
is on a different footing ; there is more of cordial intimacy, 
more of real familiar friendship between parents and chil- 
dren than generally exists among us... . The situation 
of those boys I have always thought most fortunate, with 
all the opportunities of forming lasting friendships with those 
of their own age, which a public school so largely affords, and 
with the opportunities also of keeping up all their home 
affections, of never losing that lively interest in all that is 
said and done under their father’s roof, which an absence of 
several months cannot fail in some measure to chill... . 
Your fault then is by so much the greater if you make your- 
selves strangers to domestic feelings and affections ; if you 
think you have any dearer friendships, or any that can better 
become youth or manhood, than those which God himself has 
marked out for you in your homes. Add others to them if 
you will, and it is your duty and your wisdom to do so... . 
But beware how you let any less sacred connexion weaken 
the solemn and universal bond of domestic love. Remem- 
ber that when Christ took our nature upon Him and went 
through every stage of human life to show us our peculiar 
duties in each, one of the only two things recorded of Him 
before He arrived at manhood, is His dutiful regard to His 
parents. ‘He went down to Nazareth and was subject unto 
them.’” / 
One impor; 4 is preaching was the 
constant insistence on mental cultivation as a reli- 
gious duty. Tt puie to measure the harm which 
is done by some religious teachers in speaking of the  
-P-A-G-E-102
90 THOMAS ARNOLD 
cultivation of the intellect as a thing apart from the 
religious life. It is far more common to hear from 
pulpits denunciations of the pride of intellect and the 
dangers of secular learning, than to receive a serious 
exhortation to make the best of our intellectual 
powers, and so to fit ourselves better for the posses- 
sion of influence and for the discharge of duty. But 
to Arnold it always appeared that the religion of a 
school-boy should include diligence and study, and a 
sedulous cultivation of whatever ‘powers and gifts he 
might possess. 
“Generally, to all young persons God’s call is to improve 
themselves, but what particular sort of improvement he calls 
you to, may be learned from the station of life in which he 
has placed you. If you were born in a station in which you 
would be called upon to work chiefly with your hands here- 
after, then the strengthening of your bodies, the learning to 
be active and handy, to be bold and enduring of bodily pain 
and labour, would be your special duty over and above the 
common duty of love to God and man, which belongs to every 
age and every condition alike. ... Although it be very true 
that the mind works feebly when the body is sickly, and that 
therefore you are called upon like all other persons, to make 
yourselves, as far as you can, strong and active and healthful 
and patient in your bodies, yet your especial call is rather to 
improve your minds, because it is with your minds that God 
calls upon you to work hereafter.” 
The same view is strongly accentuated in a letter 
to an old pupil. “TI rejoice that your mind seems to 
be in a healthier state about the prosecution of your 
studies. I am quite sure that it is a most solemn 
1 Sermon XIII.

INTELLECTUAL CULTURE A RELIGIOUS DUTY 91 
duty to cultivate our understandings to the uttermost, 
for I have seen the evil moral consequences of fanati- 
cism toa greater degree than I ever “expected to see 
them realized, and I-am satisfied that a neglected 
intellect is far oftener the cause of mischief to a man 
than a perverted or overvalued one.”? 
It will be observed that throughout the school ser- 
mons there is much less of theological teaching than 
of an endeavour to illustrate the bearing of Christian- 
ity on the daily practical life of the school-boy. The 
love of truth, the love of home, the conditions of of 
honest intellectual work, and the responsi 
rests upon the possessors either of knowledge or of 
other, hose_gift rvic 
are constant, s. Arnold’s dread of unreality 
made him shrink oe any attempt to set before the 
boys impossible standards, or to exact from them lan- 
guage implying maturer convictions than it was 
possible for them to possess. He le_dreaded most of _ most of 
all _unreality, or insincere professions of xeligion— 
ie was not at all distinguished for the use of current 
religious phraseology in his intercourse with boys; 
still less was he willing to encourage them to employ 
such phraseology to him or to one another. He be- 
lieved that would be beginning at the wrong end. If 
in time he made religious services and lessons more 
prominent, it was by slow degrees that he first sought 
to create the wish for them as privileges, rather than 
to impose them by authority as duties. For example, 
he took advantage of the awe and seriousness which

-P-A-G-E-104

92 THOMAS ARNOLD 
came over the whole community when one of the 
boys died; and on the following day, which was 
Sunday, he said: 
“When I came yesterday from visiting the death-bed of 
him who has been taken from us, and looked round upon all 
the familiar objects and scenes within our own ground, — 
where your common amusements were going on, with your 
common cheerfulness and activity, —I felt that there was 
nothing painful in that; it did not seem in any way shocking, 
or out of tune with those feelings which the sight of a dying 
Christian must be supposed to awaken. The unsuitableness 
in point of natural feeling between scenes of mourning and 
scenes of liveliness did not at all present itself. But I did 
feel that if any of those faults had been brought before me 
which sometimes occur amongst us, had I heard that any of 
you had been guilty of falsehood or drunkenness, or any such 
sin, had I heard from any quarter the language of profane- 
ness or unkindness or indecency, had I heard or seen any 
signs of that wretched folly which courts the laugh of fools 
by affecting to dread evil and not to care for good, then the 
unsuitableness of any of these things with the scene I had 
just quitted would have been intensely painful. And why? 
Not because such things would really have been worse than 
at any other time, but because at such a moment the eyes 
are opened really to know good and evil; because we then 
feel what it is so to live that death becomes an infinite bless- 
ing, and also what it is so to live that it were good for us if 
we had never been born.” 
It was at this time that he introduced into the 
sixth form the habit of using a short prayer before 
the first exercise every day, over and above the ordi- 
nary morning prayers. He did not attempt this in 
the lower part of the school; younger boys were not
-P-A-G-E-105
    
THE ASSOCIATIONS OF A GREAT SCHOOL 98 
prepared to appreciate or welcome such an innova- 
tion; but when he had conveyed into the minds of 
his highest class the conviction that every-day work 
ought to be consecrated, and that the contrast between 
a death-bed scene and the routine of school business 
ought not to be painful, and would not be so if the 
school business itself were made religious, it will be 
seen that the daily prayer before the first lesson had 
a new meaning; for here the outward religious form 
came after the feeling which it was meant to express, 
and not before it or apart from it. 
Arnold had great faith in the educative and enno- 
bling influence of association with a great school, as 
distinguished from a small or private seminary. He 
knew that for a youth on entering into life it was a 
high privilege to belong to an institution or a society 
with great and venerable traditions and a long his- 
toric record, —a society of which he was proud, and 
which he might re sonably hope would some day 
become proud of him. He had learned from his 
waster Aristotle that, though private education might 
de useful in special cases to correct particular faults, 
yet that in the main, education in public institutions 
watched over, if not prescribed, by the State, was the 
best fitted to prepare a man for the duties of citizen- 
ship and for the work of life. The noble conception 
of Aristotle of the magnanimous man, his scorn of 
the pxpdyuxos, or small-souled man, were ever present 
to Arnold’s mind, and he thought a scholar was in part 
protected from littleness by belonging to a community 
which had large and far-reaching interests and was 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 THOMAS ARNOLD 
recognized by the State as a public institution. 
Hence he never ceased to dwell on the importance 
of sustaining the corporate life and the feeling of 
corporate interests in the school. In a sermon 
preached at Rugby on Founder’s day, this view is 
stated at length with much clearness and force: 
“Tt seems to me that there is, or ought to be, something 
very ennobling in being connected with any establishment at 
once ancient and magnificent, where all about us and all the 
associations belonging to the objects around us should be 
great, splendid, and elevating. What an individual ought 
to derive, and often does derive, from the feeling that he is 
born of an old and illustrious race, from being familiar from 
his childhood with the walls and with the trees that speak 
of the past no less than of the present, and make both full 
of images of greatness, this in an inferior degree belongs to 
every member of an ancient and celebrated place of educa- 
tion. In this respect every one has a responsibility imposed 
upon him, which I wish that we more considered. We know 
how school traditions are handed down from one school gen- 
eration to another, and what is it, if in all these there shall 
be nothing great, nothing distinguished, nothing but a record, 
to say the best of it, of mere boyish amusements, when it is 
not a record of boyish follies? Every generation in which a 
low and foolish ‘spirit prevails does its best to pollute the 
local influences of the place, to deprive the thought of belong- 
ing to it of anything that may enkindle and ennoble the 
minds of those who come after it. And if these foolish or 
tame associations continue, they make the evil worse ; persons 
who appreciate highly the elevating influence of a great and 
ancient foundation will no longer send their sons to a place 
which has forfeited one of its most valuable powers, whose 
antiquity has nothing of the dignity, nothing of the romance, 
of antiquity, but is either a blank or worse than a blank. So
-P-A-G-E-107
SCHOOL TRADITIONS 95 
the spirit gets lower and lower, and instead of finding a help 
and an encouragement in the associations of its place of 
education, the ingenuous mind feels them all no more than 
a weight upon its efforts; they only tend to thwart it and 
keep it down. ‘This is the tendency not only of a vicious 
tone, but even of a foolish and childish one, of a tone that 
tolerates ignorance and an indifference about all save the 
amusements of the day. On the other hand, whatever is 
done here well and honourably, outlives its own genera- 
tion. . . . The size, the scale, the wealth, of a great insti- 
tution like this ensures its permanency, so far as anything 
on earth is permanent. The good and the evil, the noble- 
ness or the vileness, which may exist on this ground now, 
will live and breathe here in the days of our children ; they 
will form the atmosphere in which they will live hereafter, 
either wholesome and invigorating, or numbing and deadly.” ? 
Arnold’s dread of any theory which would tend to 
view the life of the scholar as a thing apart from the 
life of a Christian, found further expression in a 
memorable sermon on Christian education, from the 
striking text in Deuteronomy, “Ye shall teach these 
my words unto your children, speaking of them when 
thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest 
by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou 
risest up.” The preacher takes the opportunity of 
protesting earnestly against any attempt to divorce 
religious from secular instruction, or to treat them 
as distinct parts of an educational scheme. The 
device sometimes advocated in later times for solving 
the religious difficulty in our common and munici- 
pal schools, by confining the functions of the school 
1Sermon XVI., Vol. JIL, p. 210. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
96 THOMAS ARNOLD 
teacher to secular instruction and calling in the aid 
of the clergy or other specialists to give lessons on 
religion at separate hours, would have seemed to him 
wholly indefensible, and indeed fatal to any true 
conception of the relation of religious knowledge to 
other knowledge. 
“Tt is clear that neither is the Bible alone sufficient to 
give a complete religious education, nor is it possible to teach 
history, and moral and political philosophy, with no reference 
to the Bible, without giving an education that shall be anti- 
religious. For, in the one case, the rule is given without the 
application, and in the other, the application is derived from 
a wrong rule. If, indeed, history were rigorously nothing 
but a simple collection of particular facts; if the writers 
made no remarks on them, and the readers drew from them 
no conclusions, there might indeed be no reference to a wrong 
rule, and the study might be harmless except as a waste of 
time. But as this is not and cannot be the case, as almost 
every writer of history does comment upon his facts and reason 
about them, and as all readers, even when they cannot be 
said to draw conclusions from a history, are yet sure to catch 
some moral impression, so it becomes impossible to read and 
think much about human actions and human character, with- 
out referring both to God’s standard, and yet, at the same 
time, to avoid separating off a large portion of our moral 
nature from the guidance and habitual sovereignty of God.” ? 
His strongest sentiment as_a_teacher, that—the 
intellectual life shouldbe dominated and controlled _ by moral and spiritual influences, is well summed up 
in a phrase which occurs in a letter to an old pupil. 
“T call by the name of wisdom, knowledge rich and 
1 Sermon XVL., Vol. III. 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  CLERICAL SCHOOLMASTERS 97 
varied, digested and combined, and pervaded through 
and through by the light of the spirit of God.” 
The union of the clerical office with that of the 
schoolmaster, which, with few exceptions, has been 
the traditional practice of the public schools for four 
centuries, was thus in Arnold’s case justified in a 
remarkable degree. And there can be no doubt that 
it has some advantages. Parents, in parting with 
the moral supervision of their sons, are not unreason- 
ably disposed to place increased confidence in a head 
master who combines the scholarship and skill of the 
teacher with the dignity and weight of the clergy- 
man’s office. And it is unquestionable that the 
opportunity thus afforded to the head master of per- 
forming pastoral functions, and especially of preach- 
ing in the school chapel, gives unity to the whole 
discipline of the institution and adds to his own 
means of influence. In days in which scholars by 
profession were nearly all in holy orders, the most 
obvious and reasonable course for a governing body 
was to choose the head master from the clerical 
ranks. But in view of the state of learning and the 
educational requirements of our own times, the sur- 
vival of this usage is not only undesirable, but 
often mischievous. It seriously narrows the range 
of choice open to trustees and governors. Many 
men of the highest academic distinction do not take 
orders, and yet desire to devote themselves to the 
profession of teacher. The demand for skill and 
educational experience, in addition to some acquain- 
tance with the philosophy and the history of teach- 
H
-P-A-G-E-110
98 THOMAS ARNOLD 
ing, is daily more audible; and experience does not 
show that these qualities are more likely to be pos- 
sessed by a clergyman than by a layman. The fact 
that the head-mastership of a great public school 
often proves a step to ecclesiastical preferment is in 
itself not without its drawbacks. It subordinates 
the profession of a teacher to that of a church dig- 
nitary; it prevents the bestowal of a man’s best 
powers upon the duties of a schoolmaster, by setting 
before him as an object of higher ambition the 
attainment of a deanery or a bishopric. Sometimes, 
also, the candidate for the headship of a public 
school expresses his willingness to take orders if he 
is elected; although, teaching apart, the clerical voca- 
tion may not be specially congenial to him. In this 
way a grave injustice is often done to scholars of 
eminence, who have sought to qualify themselves for 
the profession of teaching and intend to make it the 
business of their lives. 
We may look forward, then, with hope to the time 
when, as a rule, laymen will fill the highest scholas- 
tic offices, or when, at least, men will be chosen for 
those offices on the grounds of their professional 
qualifications only, without reference to the accident 
of their having taken or not taken holy orders. In 
no other way can the function of the schoolmaster 
assume its rightful rank among the liberal and 
learned professions. Nevertheless, it will nearly 
always happen that a person gifted with the true 
teaching instinct, and conscious of his own responsi- 
bility in regard to the moral and spiritual well-being 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  CHRISTIAN EDUCATION 99 
of his scholars, will greatly value the opportunity of 
addressing the school collectively on the highest of 
all subjects. And for this purpose a license to 
preach in the college chapel should be obtained from 
the bishop of the diocese. No breach of church order 
would occur if the school were thus regarded as a 
peculium, outside the ordinary ecclesiastical rules, 
with its ordained chaplain for the performance of the 
Church’s ordinances, and with special recognition of 
the right of the head master to address the whole 
community from the pulpit whenever he desired to 
do so. A

“Give me cfedit,” he says in a letter to a friend, “for a 
most sincere desire to make Rugby a place of Christian edu- 
cation. At the same time my object will be, if possible, to 
form Christian men, for Christian boys I can scarcely hope 
to make. I mean that, from the naturally imperfect state of 
boyhood, they are not susceptible of Christian principles in 
their full development and practice; and I suspect that a 
low standard of morals in many respects must be tolerated 
among them, as it was on a larger scale, in what I consider 
the boyhood of the human race.”

t i love of truth for i n 
sake, rather than to enforce any number of truths 
as understood by theologians; and_t Z 
and_generous aspirations after future honour~and 
usefulness. s the best means of attaining these 
ends, he always extolled the virtue of that courage 
which will resist what is evil in the public opinion 
of the school, and which will render all other forms 
of excellence easier and more possible. Nearly all 
boyish faults and vices he knew ultimately resolved 
themselves into cowardice. Falsehood, indolence, 
shirking, the low ideal of duty which comes from 
acquiescence in the worst usages of one’s fellows,— 
all were traceable to lack of courage. L’esprit de 
solidarité dans le mal, he thought the most dangerous 
of a school-boy’s temptations, and he never ceased to 
expose it and to denounce it. But it does not need 
that a high-minded Christian schoolmaster should 
have been ordained as a priest, in order that he may 
see the need of such teaching and be able to give it 
with effect, and in the right spirit. 
On the subject of school punishments, Arnold did 
not profess to be much in advance of his age. All 
the traditions of the public schools were in favour of 
flogging. In some of the corporate seals of chartered 
foundations a rod occupies a conspicuous place as part 
of the arms or device of an endowed grammar school. 
For example, the common seal granted to the Louth 
Grammar School with the letters-patent of Edward
-P-A-G-E-113
  PUNISHMENTS 101 
the Sixth (1552) represents a pedagogue in the act 
of inflicting corporal punishment, and contains the 
legend, Qui parcit virge odit filium. The rod was in 
fact the emblem of discipline, the one characteristic 
symbol of magisterial authority. Arnold himself 
said, in one of his letters before going to Rugby: 
“When I think about this, I long to take rod 
in hand;”! and so far as the younger boys were 
concerned, he made no apology for retaining the 
ancient discipline of the public schools. Had he 
lived in later times, when the theory of education and 
the study of child nature have received more system- 
atic attention, when other and wiser means of cor- 
recting evil have been discovered, and when some 
of the best-ordered and happy educational communi- 
ties exist without the employment of physical pun- 
ishments in any form, he would probably have 
changed his views on this subject, and acknowledged 
that in just the proportion in which a skilled teacher 
understands his business, it becomes less necessary for 
him to resort to corporal punishment at all. It was 
with increasing reluctance that he inflicted it, confin- 
ing it chiefly to moral offences, such as lying, drink- 
ing, and habitual idleness, keeping the use of it as 
much as possible in the background, and for younger 
scholars only, and regarding it as wholly unsuited 
as the penalty for intellectual weakness or dulness. 
Yet to merely sentimental objections to it as degrad- 
ing to the recipient he would yield nothing. With 
characteristic directness, he declared that corporal 
1 Letter XXII.
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 THOMAS ARNOLD 
punishment fitly marked and answered to the natu- 
rally inferior state of boyhood, and therefore conveyed 
no peculiar degradation to persons in such a state. 
“T know well of what feeling this argument about 
the degrading character of such punishment is the 
expression. It originates in that proud notion of 
personal independence, which is neither reasonable 
nor Christian, but essentially barbarian. It visited 
Europe with all the curses of the age of chivalry, and 
is threatening us now with those of Jacobinism. At 
an age when it is almost impossible to find a true 
manly sense of the degradation of guilt or faults, 
where is the wisdom of encouraging a fantastic sense 
of the degradation of personal correction?” The 
thought that it was sin which degrades, not the 
punishment of sin, was ever uppermost in his mind 
and prominent in his sermons. “What I want to see 
in the school, and what I cannot find, is an abhor- 
rence of evil. I always think of the psalm, ‘Neither 
doth he abhor anything that is evil.’ ” 
Much of the influence he gained over his scholars 
—influence which enabled him to dispense in an 
increasing degree with corporal punishment — was 
attributable to his knowledge of the individual char- 
acteristics of boys. He is said to have known every 
boy in the school, his appearance, his habits, and his 
companions. This is a kind of knowledge which has 
long been known to be characteristic of the disci- 
plinary system of the Jesuits, but has not been 
common among the head masters of English public 
schools. Arnold valued it highly and found many 
 
-P-A-G-E-115

opportunities of turning it to useful account. It 
cannot be said that he was always genial in manner; \ 
the younger boys, especially, regarded him with awe, 
and his own sense of the intense seriousness of life 
and duty gave a sternness and austerity to his aspect 
which made many of his pupils afraid of him. He 
liked to encourage games and sports, though he 
seldom joined in them, and had a healthy love 
of bathing, exercise, and long skirmishings in the 
country. His sympathy with these pursuits showed 
itself mainly in hasty and occasional visits to the 
school close. He certainly did nothing to encourage 
that extravagant passion for athletics, that exaltation 
of physical prowess to the same level as intellectual 
distinction, which has in later years so seriously 
debased the ideal and hindered the usefulness of the 
great public schools. Mr. Oscar Browning has well 
said on this point: “The most salient characteristic of 
modern public schools is the reception of games into 
the curriculum on an equality with work, if not into 
a superior position. Of this Arnold would entirely 
have disapproved. He would have seen that it min- 
istered to a lower standard of effort, that it vulgarized 
intellectual labour, that it substituted self-indulgence 
for self-denial, and that it placed those boys in posi- 
tions of command and influence who were frequently 
most unfit to exercise either the one or the other.” 
The danger of the modern “cultus” of sports and 
athletics is precisely that which Aristotle pointed out 
in the Politics (VIII. 3-35) when he denounced the ex 
treme and violent training which was imposed by the
-P-A-G-E-116
104 THOMAS ARNOLD 
gymnastic exercises of the Spartan youth, as tending 
to make them “ brutal of soul.” +‘ Physical courage is 
not the only end,” he urged, “to be aimed at in civil 
education.” A savage and brutal soul is less compati- 
ble with exalted courage than a gentle soul trained 
so as to be exquisitely sensitive to the feelings of 
shame and honour. The most savage and unfeeling 
among the barbarian tribes were far from being the 
most courageous. A man trained on the Lacedemo- 
nian system in bodily exercises alone, destitute even 
of the most indispensable mental culture, was a real 
Bavavoos, useful only for one branch of political duty, 
and even for that less useful than if he had been dif- 
ferently trained.? 
Modern experience in public schools curiously re- 
produces that of Greece more than two thousand years 
ago. For the moment the type of school-boy and of 
manhood most in favour with the British public is 
Spartan rather than Athenian; but there can be no 
doubt that Arnold, faithful to the teaching of his own 
master, would have sought to resist the prevailing 
fashion, and to confine athletic sports within narrower 
limits. 
The truth is that the Arnoldian tradition which has 
become slowly evolved and has fixed itself in the 
minds of most English people, is based more upon Mr. 
Thomas Hughes’ romance, than upon the actual life 
as set forth in Stanley’s volumes. Tom Brown’s 
School Days is a manly and spirited book, and is 
pervaded throughout with a sense of humour, a sym- 
1§ee Grote’s Aristotle, p. 544.
-P-A-G-E-117
TOM BROWN’S SCHOOL DAYS 105 
pathy with boyhood, and a love of righteousness and 
truth. The story is well and vigorously told, and 
has been deservedly admired. But as Matthew Ar- 
nold once said to me, it has been praised quite 
enough, for it gives only one side, and that not the 
best side, of Rugby school life, or of Arnold’s character. 
It leaves out of view, almost wholly, the intellectual 
purpose of a school. It gives the reader the impres- 
sion that it is the chief business of a public school to 
produce a healthy animal, to supply him with pleasant 
companions and faithful friends, to foster in him 
courage and truthfulness, and for the rest to teach as 
much as the regulations of the school enforce, but no 
more. It is to be feared that Hughes’ own boyhood 
was not spent with the best set at Rugby. There were 
in his time Lake, C. J. Vaughan, Arthur Stanley, 
Bradley, Lushington, the two Walronds, Matthew and 
Thomas Arnold, but of these, and of the intense in- 
tellectual strain in the sixth form and the upper 
schoolhouse set, and of the aims by which they were 
inspired, Hughes appeared to have little or no know- 
ledge. His typical school-boy is seen delighting in wan- 
ton mischief, in sport, in a fight, and even in a theft 
from a farm-yard, distinguished frequently by inso- 
lence to inferiors, and even by coarseness and brutal- 
ity, but not by love of work or by any strong interest 
in intellectual pursuits. It is after alla one-sided and 
very imperfect view of ethical discipline, which while it 
seeks to make a boy sensitive on the point of honour, 
refusing to “blab” or tell tales of a schoolfellow, is 
yet tolerant of “cribs” and “vulguses” and other de- 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
106 THOMAS ARNOLD 
vices by which masters could be hoodwinked or 
deceived. 
This picture of a public school, in spite of its attrac- 
tive features and of its unquestionable power and 
reality, will probably be quoted in future years as 
illustrating the low standard of civilization, the false 
ideal of manliness, and the deep-seated indifference 
to learning for its own sake which characterized the 
upper classes of our youth in the early half of the 
nineteenth century. In short, the book will be held 
to explain and justify the famous epithet of “Bar- 
barians” which Matthew Arnold was wont to apply 
to the English aristocracy and to that section of 
society which was most nearly influenced by the 
great public schools. 
At the Universities it soon became noticeable, 
not only that Rugby won an increasing number of 
academic triumphs, but that the Rugbeians were 
characterized by a certain gravity and by a deeper 
seriousness of purpose in life than were to be 
found among ordinary public-school boys. They 
were not on that account very popular. The as- 
sociations which surround ordinary undergraduates, 
and the talk to which they listen, and the homes 
from which they come, are not specially calculated to 
encourage moral thoughtfulness and introspection; 
and, to say the truth, young people who are prema- 
turely distinguished by these qualities are apt to be 
regarded as “prigs.” Nothing exasperates the ayver- 
age man more than the airs of a superior person, and 
it may be readily admitted that there was in Arnold’s
-P-A-G-E-119
  A TEMPLE OF INDUSTRIOUS PEACE 107 
intense earnestness and intellectual aspiration some 
tendency to beget among his elder pupils self-con- 
sciousness and a too pronounced scorn for what 
satisfies commonplace people. But, after all, this 
danger, though a real one, is not that from which 
English society and English boyhood are likely to 
suffer much. Most of the faults and shortcomings of 
the British “barbarian” lie in the opposite direction. 
And an infusion into our social system of a few men 
with high and even impossible ideals, and with too 
much earnestness, may well be borne by John Bull 
without much complaining or loss. 
Cit may be said generally that Arnold’s conception of 
a school was that it should be first of all a place for 
“the-formation of character, and next a place forlearn-   
  in, a means for the attainment of this 
jhigher_end. Discipline and guidance were in his 
view still more prominently the business of a school- 
master than the communication of knowledge. The 
motives he sought to develop and strengthen were 
the love of righteousness, the admiration of valour, eaten coe eee eae 
genius, and patriotism, the sense of duty to others 
  
or base_in daily action. But the main condition on 
which the incidental attainment of this object was 
possible was that the community should be aw fond 
pervaded with the spirit of work, and that the proper 
business of a good school, the production of exact 
and accomplished scholars, should be thoroughly well 
fulfilled. Thomas Carlyle, who stayed a week at 
Rugby, characterized the school as a “temple of
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 THOMAS ARNOLD 
industrious peace.” This would hardly be an accu- 
rate description of a modern public school in which 
boat races and football matches are the prominent 
topics of discussion and furnish the chief fields of 
ambition. 
One of the most distinguished of Arnold’s succes- 
sors in the head-mastership of Rugby, Dr. Percival, 
now the Lord Bishop of Hereford, in writing to me 
has thus summarized his estimate of Arnold’s school 
work and personal influence : 
“Tf I were called upon to express in a sentence or 
two my feeling in regard to Dr. Arnold’s influence on 
school life, I should describe him as a great prophet 
among schoolmasters, rather than an instructor or 
educator in the ordinary sense of the term.~ Some 
are appointed to be prophets, and some pastors and 
teachers, and he was undoubtedly one of the great- 
est in the first of these classes. I remember asking 
Dean Stanley if Arnold taught them a great deal in 
the sixth form in the course of his lessons, and in 
reply to my question the Dean held up a little note- 
book which he happened to have in his hand at the 
moment, and said, ‘I could put everything that Ar- 
nold ever taught me in the way of instruction into 
this little book.’ 
“Thus it might fairly be said of him, as was said of 
a famous Oxford leader the other day, that his influ- 
ence was stimulative rather than formative, the secret 
of his power consisting not so much in the novelty of 
his ideas or methods, as in his commanding and mag- 
netic personality, and the intensity and earnestness
-P-A-G-E-121
  ARNOLD A PROPHET 109 
with which he impressed his views, and made them — 
as a prophet makes his message — a part of the living 
forces of the time. 
“The dominating idea of his Rugby life was that a 
head master is called of God to make his school a 
Christian school, an idea which has no doubt been en- 
throned in the hearts of multitudes of other school- 
masters, both before and since; but he was destined 
to make it a new power in the world through the 
intensity with which he nursed it as a prophetic in- 
spiration, and preached it in all his words and works 
with a prophetic fervour. This idea pervades not only 
his chapel sermons, but all the activities of his life. 
In his lessons, his study of history, his discipline, his 
exhortations addressed to the sixth form, and to the 
whole school, and his dealings with individual boys, 
he is felt to be always striving to infuse into the com- 
mon life his own enthusiasm of Christian earnestness, 
and to stimulate the growth of public spirit, moral 
thoughtfulness, and what we sum up as Christian 
character. 
“Such, I take it, is the best part of the inheritance 
we owe to him, as it is the food and sustenance of all 
our highest hopes for the future of English schools.”

Arnold’s extra-scholastic interests— Why such interests are neces- 
sary for a teacher— Foreign travel—Extracts from diary — 
Love of Nature —Intercourse with the poor needed by himself 
and by his pupils— University settlements and mission work 
in connexion with public schools — Politics — The Reform Bill— 
The Englishman's Register —The society for the diffusion of 
useful knowledge — Mechanics’ Institutes — The London Uni- 
versity — Arnold’s attitude towards each of these enterprises 
Ir is impossible for readers to understand the true 
significance of a life or to estimate the value of a 
man’s work without taking into account the pursuits 
and tastes which have lain outside of his professional 
duties. It is a familiar truism that we come into 
the world not only to get a living but to live; and 
that the life we live depends as much upon the tastes 
we form, the number and variety of the interests 
which appeal to us, as upon the manner in which our 
definite and ostensible work is done. A life wholly 
devoted to professional duty is necessarily an incom- 
plete life. That duty can only be seen in its true 
proportions, can, in fact, only be properly discharged 
at all when its relation to the larger interests which 
lie outside of it is clearly perceived. This is true of 
all human employments. But it is especially true in 
regard to the office of a teacher. There is an inevi- 
table closeness in the intellectual atmosphere of a 
110
-P-A-G-E-123
  EXTRA-SCHOLASTIC INTERESTS 111 
schoolroom, and the best teachers are precisely those 
who are most conscious of the need of some sphere of 
activity beyond its walls. Nothing serves so well to 
keep the life of a schoolmaster sweet and wholesome 
as a love for some study or employment which he 
pursues for its own sake, and which has no immedi- 
ate and visible relation to the routine of teaching or to 
the passing of examinations. Pedantry and donnish- 
ness, the characteristic faults of the teacher’s calling, 
are wont to be encouraged by the constant exercise of 
authority in a little world composed entirely of his in- 
tellectual inferiors, by the habitual use of the impera- 
tive mood, and by an exclusive, albeit conscientious, 
absorption in scholastic functions. We all need, if 
we would see our work in true perspective, a vivid 
sense of the richness and spaciousness of the world 
outside and some contact with its greater interests, 
especially those which touch most nearly the border- 
land of our own profession and home. And we can 
never understand Arnold’s educational work unless 
we enquire how he employed his. leisure, and what 
were his relations to the larger world of thought and 
action, of which, after all, a school is only a part. 
Arnold was very conscious of the limitations which 
his profession imposed, and of the danger of sinking 
to the rank of a mere dominie. And he found the 
needful expansion in more directions than one. For- 
eign travel was to him one of the most effective and 
the most delightful expedients for correcting the ten- 
dency to professional narrowness and pedantry. He 
felt refreshed and invigorated by it.
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“T am come out alone, my dearest,” he says in one of his 
home letters, “ to see the morning sun on Mont Blane, and the 
lake, and to look, I trust, with more than outward eyes on 
this glorious scene. It is overpowering like all intense beauty, 
if you dwell on it, but I contrast it immediately with our 
Rugby horizon and my life of duty there, and our cloudy sky 
of England, clouded alas! socially, far more than physically. 
And if, as I trust it will, this rambling and this beauty 
of nature in foreign lands shall have strengthened me for my 
work in England, then we may both rejoice that we have had 
this little parting.” 
It is noticeable that there is little or no evidence 
in his letters or journals of any interest in what is 
generally called “art.” There are no raptures about 
the great painters. He doubtless visited the Uffizi 
gallery at Florence, the Accademia at Venice, and 
the galleries of the Vatican, but none of them moved 
or inspired him much, and he says little or nothing 
about their treasures. Nor, except once at Pisa, did 
the architecture of the great Italian cathedrals, the 
music, the solemn procession, or the mere pictu- 
resqueness of the ceremonial of the Roman church, 
win from him either admiration or criticism. “I 
care little for the sight of the churches, and nothing 
at all for the recollection of them. St. John Lateran 
is the finest of them, and the form of the Greek cross 
at St. Maria degli Angeli is much better for these 
buildings than that of the Latin. But precious mar- 
bles and gilding and rich colouring are to me like the 
kaleidoscope and no more, and these churches are 
almost as inferior to ours, in my judgment, as their 
worship is to ours.”
-P-A-G-E-125
LOVE OF NATURE 113 
So it may be said with some truth, that he was 
deficient in critical appreciation so far as the fine arts 
were concerned. But he had a keen and loving eye 
for the beauties of Nature, and his letters are filled 
with passages showing minute observation of the 
scenery through which he passed, and testifying also 
to the delight with which such experience filled his 
heart. Though his tastes were not materially influ- 
enced by poetry, and although imaginative literature 
generally had little charm for him, he had caught 
much of the Wordsworthian spirit. It was not 
merely as a picture that the loveliness of the out- 
ward world of hill and valley, of rock and cataract, 
of gloom and sunshine, appealed most to him. He 
was, like Wordsworth, 
“__ well pleased to recognize 
In Nature and the language of the sense 
The anchor of my purer thoughts, the nurse, 
The guide and guardian of my heart, and soul 
Of all my moral being.” 
And his sense of the richness and glory of the 
visible world was keenest when he could associate 
them with the doings and the character of the people 
who lived on it. It was as an arena for human 
activity that Europe and its physical characteristics 
seemed to him best worth studying, and the influence 
of natural scenery on history, industry, and national 
welfare filled a larger space in his thoughts than the 
gratification of esthetic sensibility. As an example 
of the accuracy of his observation, this passage from 
one of his letters may be fitly cited:
-P-A-G-E-126
114 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“We crossed the Tiber a little beyond Perugia, where it 
was a most miserable ditch with hardly water enough to turn 
a mill; indeed, most of the streams which flow from the 
Apennines were altogether dried up, and the dry and thirsty 
appearance of everything was truly oriental. The flowers 
were a great delight to me, and it was very beautiful to see 
the hedges full of the pomegranate in full flower, the bright 
scarlet blossom is so exceedingly ornamental, to say nothing 
of one’s associations with the fruit. What we call the Span- 
ish broom of our gardens is the common wild broom of the 
Apennines, but I do not think it is so beautiful as our own. 
The fig trees were most luxuriant, but not more so than in 
the Isle of Wight, and I got tired of the continual occurrence 
of fruit trees, chiefly olives, instead of large forest trees. The 
vale of Florence looks quite pale and dull in comparison of 
our rich valleys, from the total want of timber, and in Flor- 
ence itself there is not a tree. How miserably inferior to 
Oxford is Florence altogether, both within, and as seen from a 
distance ; in short, I never was so disappointed in any place 
in my life. My favourite towns were Genoa, Milan, and 
Verona. The situation of the latter, just at the foot of the 
Alps, and almost encircled, like Durham, by a full and rapid 
river, the Adige, was very delightful.” + 
As an illustration of the alacrity with which he 
seized on any link between the present and the past, 
and turned from the observation of the material sur- 
roundings and people to the consideration of their 
history and character, this extract may be quoted 
from the diary (1828) in which he describes his first 
view of the Rhine and of Cologne. 
“We burst upon the view of the valley of the Rhine, the 
city of Cologne with all its towers, the Rhine itself distinctly 
1 Letter XVI.
-P-A-G-E-127
THE RECREATIONS OF LIFE 115 
seen at the distance of seven miles, the Seven Mountains 
above Bonn on our right, and a boundless sweep of the 
country beyond the Rhine in front of us. To be sure, it 
was a striking contrast to the first view of the valley of the 
Tiber from the Mountains of Viterbo; but the Rhine in 
mighty recollections will vie with anything, and this spot 
was particularly striking. Cologne was Agrippa’s colony 
inhabited by Germans, brought from beyond the river, to 
live as the subjects of Rome ; the river itself was the fron- 
tier of the Empire, —the limit as it were of two worlds, 
that of Roman laws and customs, and that of German. For 
before us lay the land of our Saxon and Teutonic forefathers, 
the land uncorrupted by Roman or any other mixture, the 
birthplace of the most moral races of men that the world 
has yet seen, of the soundest laws, the least violent passions, 
and the fairest domestic and civil virtues. I thought of 
that memorable defeat of Varus and his three legions, which 
for ever confined the Romans to the western side of the 
Rhine, and preserved the Teutonic nation — the regenerating 
element in modern Europe — safe and free.” 
But it was not merely to physical exercise and to 
acquaintance with foreign lands that he turned for 
the needful refreshment and solace, and for the means 
of enlarging the sphere of his own interests beyond 
the walls of the schoolroom. Even when at Laleham, 
he felt the need of distraction of another kind. Not 
only enjoyment, but fresh and different duty, seemed 
to him needful to restore the balance of life, and to 
save him from the fate of becoming a mere pedagogue. 
And one of the duties which he found most helpful 
for this purpose was that of making himself more 
closely acquainted with the condition and the feelings 
of the poor. He said in a letter to his friend Tucker:
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 THOMAS ARNOLD 
“T care not a straw for the labour of the half year ; for it 
is not labour but vexation which hurts a man, and I find my 
comfort depends more and more on the pupils’ good and bad 
conduct. They are an awful charge, but still to me a very 
interesting one, and one which I could cheerfully pursue till 
my health or faculties fail me. Moreover, I have now taken 
up the care of the Workhouse, 7.e. as far as going there once 
a week to read prayers and give a sort of lecture upon some 
part of the Bible. I wanted to see more of the poor peo- 
ple, and I found that unless I devoted a regular time to it I 
should never do it, for the hunger for exercise, on the part of 
myself and my horse, used to send me out riding as soon as 
my work was done. Whereas now I give up Thursday to 
the village, and it will be my own fault if it does not do me 
more good than the exercise would.” ! 
The belief that the life of a scholar might easily 
become too isolated and selfish a life, that a know- 
ledge of the needs and feelings of the poor and of 
the unprivileged classes was a valuable part of educa- 
tion, and that the possession of intellectual advantages 
carried with it the obligation to do something for 
those who did not possess them, became stronger as 
experience brought him more into contact with the 
sons of rich men and made him more familiar with 
the peculiar temptations of their life. The memory 
of the wholesome tonic influence which had become 
so valuable to himself, when visiting the workhouse 
at Laleham, remained with him through life. In the 
course of two remarkable sermons, XXII. and XXIII., 
on a single episode in our Lord’s life, his eating and 
drinking with a mixed company and in the house of 
1 Letter XII.
-P-A-G-E-129
FAMILY AFFECTIONS 117 
Levi the publican, he took occasion to warn young 
men against the dangers of selfish isolation, either in 
the scholar’s life or in the life of what is called 
“society,” — the companionship of those of one’s own 
station and of pursuits akin to one’s own. Speaking 
of Christ’s example and the kind of intercourse with 
our fellow-creatures which is calculated to do us most 
good, he said: 
“We dare not in this case trust ourselves in the society 
of publicans and simers, we should not do good to them, 
but they would rather infect us with their own evil. But 
the natural remedy for our peculiar dangers, the way in 
which we can best mix with our brethren for the nourish- 
ment of our affections, is to be found in the intercourse with 
our own families on the one hand, and with the poor on the 
other.” 
On the former of these points, the necessity of cul- 
tivating to the fullest the family affections, he always 
spoke with peculiar emphasis. Singularly blessed as 
he was with a happy home, accustomed to do much 
of his literary work in the room in which wife and 
children were around him, and deriving strength and 
inspiration from their presence, the boys could never 
fail to see how the domestic life was the centre round 
which all his thoughts clustered. The picture de- 
scribed by a pupil of the fireside at Laleham may re- 
mind us of the story of Melanchthon, who was found 
by the Pope’s legate intently studying his Greek 
Testament held in one hand, while he rocked the 
cradle with the other. And it is very characteristic 
of the extent to which he himself was sensitive to 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    118 THOMAS ARNOLD 
the sweet and gracious influences of home, that he 
took occasion to object even to the apparently inno- 
cent and useful institution of reading parties for the 
long vacation as being not without its drawbacks. 
“T cannot but think that a most evil habit has of late 
years grown up amongst young men when engaged in read- 
ing — that of going away from their homes and fixing them- 
selves, for three or four months, in some remote part of the 
country, where they might study without interruption. It 
may be that more is thus read than would be read at home, 
though scarcely more than might be; but even supposing it 
to be so, it is a dangerous price that is paid for it. The 
simple quiet of a common family circle, the innumerable 
occasions of kindness that it affords, and its strong tendency 
to draw away our thoughts from self and to awaken our 
affections for others, —a discipline precious at every period 
of life, —can then least of all be spared when the hardnesses 
of the world are just coming upon us, when our studies and 
even our animal spirits are all combining to make us selfish 
and proud.”   
On the second point — the need of keeping open the 
sympathies and of redressing whatever of evil is in the 
life of the wealthy, by friendly and yet unpatronizing 
intercourse with the poor — he was wont to be yet more 
emphatic. At Rugby, as at Laleham, he had put 
himself, so far as opportunity served, into communi- 
cation with working men and women, and had derived 
great benefit from the experience. 
“ Another way of mixing with our brethren in a manner 
most especially pleasing to Christ and useful to others, is by 
holding frequent intercourse with the poor. Perhaps to 
young men of the richer classes there is nothing which 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
INTERCOURSE WITH THE POOR 119 
makes their frequent residence in large towns so mischievous 
to them as the difficulties which they find in the way of such 
intercourse. In the country, many a young man knows 
something at least of his poorer neighbours ; but in towns, 
the numbers of the poor, and the absence of any special 
connexion between him and any of them in particular, hin- 
ders him too often from knowing anything of them at all, 
—an evil which is as much to be regretted on the one side 
as on the other, and which is quite as mischievous to the 
minds and tempers of the rich as it is to the bodily condition 
of the poor. I can hardly imagine anything more useful to 
a young man of an active and powerful mind, advancing 
rapidly in knowledge and with high distinction either actu- 
ally obtained or close in prospect, than to take him — or, 
much better, that he should go of himself — to the abodes 
of poverty, of sickness, and old age. Everything there is a 
lesson ; in everything Christ speaks, and the spirit of Christ 
is ready to convey to his heart all that he witnesses. Accus- 
tomed to all the comforts of life, and hardly ever thinking 
what it would be to want them, he sees poverty in all its 
evils, — scanty room, and too often scanty fuel, scanty cloth- 
ing, and scanty food. Instead of the quietness and neatness 
of his own chamber, he finds very often a noise and a confu- 
sion which would render deep thought impossible ; instead 
of the stores of knowledge with which his own study is filled, 
he finds perhaps only a prayer-book and a Bible... . He 
will see old age and sickness and labour borne not only with 
patience, but with thankfulness, through the aid of that 
Bible and the grace of the Holy Spirit who is its author. 
He will find that while hes language and studies would be 
utterly unintelligible to the ears of those whom he is visiting, 
yet that they in their turn have a language and feelings to 
which he is no less a stranger. . . . It would, indeed, be a 
blessed thing, and would make this place really a seminary 
of true religion and useful learning, if those among us who 
are of more thoughtful years, and especially those of us who
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 THOMAS ARNOLD. 
are likely to become ministers of Christ hereafter, would 
remember that their Christian education has commenced 
already, and that he cannot learn in Christ’s school who 
does not acquaint himself something with the poor. Two 
or three at first, five or six afterwards, a very small number, 
might begin a practice, which under proper regulations and 
guided by Christian prudence, as well as actuated by Chris- 
tian love, would be equally beneficial to the poor and to 
yourselves.” ! 
We have in these sermons an indication that to 
learn to be of service to others was a great part of 
his own education, and that it should also be set 
forth before the young, as an indispensable part of 
theirs. The belief that the well-born and the pros- 
perous have as much to learn from intercourse with 
the poor, as the poor could possibly learn in return, 
was founded on his own experience and was imparted, 
as occasion served, to his elder boys. This belief has 
since his time found expression in many ways. The 
University Settlements in the South and East of 
London, Toynbee Hall, the efforts of Eton, Marl- 
borough, and other public schools to maintain dif- 
ferent forms of missionary and social enterprise in 
the poorer suburbs of London, are, though of later 
date, all in their way legitimate products of Arnold’s 
influence, of the spirit which he sought to infuse into

privileges, implies a corresponding obligation towards

POLITICAL UNREST OF THE TIME 121 
those who are without it. By way of further anti- 
dote to the narrowing influence of his professional 
duties, Stanley notices Arnold’s Lectures to Me- 
chanics’ Institutes at Rugby and Lutterworth, his 
frequent sermons to village congregations, the estab- 
lishment of a dispensary, his tracts of advice on the 
appearance of the cholera; and, at the time of the 
construction of the railway, his exertions to procure 
the sanction of the Bishop to the performance of short 
services for the labourers employed on it, to be con- 
ducted by himself and his assistant masters in turn. 
There were circumstances in the political and social 
life of the kingdom at the time which were well cal- 
culated to occasion grave anxiety, and to stimulate 
an ardent reformer like Arnold with a desire to take 
a part in public life. The period of the Reform Bill 
happened to coincide with the prevalence of much 
distress and industrial unrest. The resolute resist- 
ance of the Duke of Wellington and the Tory party 
to the enactment of that measure embittered the 
temper of the unenfranchised classes; and the in- 
creasing use of steam mechanism, both for manufact- 
ures and for locomotion, caused a dislocation in our 
industrial system, closed up some of the avenues to 
employment, and excited considerable alarm among 
the working classes. Arnold took the keenest inter- 
est in the angry and, as it seemed to him, somewhat 
perilous conflicts of the time. He believed that the 
social dangers which threatened the nation could only 
be averted by the exercise of more sympathy on the 
part of the ruling classes, and more intelligence on
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 THOMAS ARNOLD 
the part of the ruled. So he determined to venture 
on a new periodical, the Englishman’s Register, which 
lived a brief life, from May to July, 1831. 
“T want,” he said, “to get up a real Poor Man’s Maga- 
zine, which should not bolster up abuses and veil iniquities, 
nor prose to the poor as to children, but should address them 
in the style of Cobbett, plainly, boldly, and in sincerity, ex- 
cusing nothing, concealing nothing, and misrepresenting noth- 
ing, but speaking the very whole truth in love.”? 
It is very characteristic of him that he plunged 
into this chivalrous enterprise before he had well 
assured himself of probable support from friends and 
sympathizers, and before he had adequately estimated 
the serious pecuniary obligations which it entailed. 
“Our hope is,” he said, in his introductory article, “to 
rally those, and we believe there are many who feel in these 
tremendous times as we do, who are disgusted alike with the 
folly and iniquity that would keep all things as they are, 
and with the no less foolish and unprincipled violence which 
would destroy rather than reform, and which pollutes even 
reform itself by its unchristian spirit and resentments.” 
Accordingly, he contributed to the paper some vigor- 
ous articles in favour of the reform of the representa- 
tive system, and interspersed them with other articles 
on the labouring classes, and with a series of exposi- 
tory articles on the book of Genesis, and on the 
lessons which might be derived from it in relation 
to the right economy and use of life. After the 
discontinuance of the Register he contributed to the 
1 Letter XXVI.

HIS POLITICAL WRITINGS 123 
Sheffield Courant a succession of letters on the social 
condition of the operative classes, which dealt with 
such topics as labour, wages, poverty, education, and 
reform in a manner which is no less remarkable for 
the sympathy with which he viewed the condition, the 
needs, and the aspirations of the poor, than for 
the earnestness with which he warned them against 
indulging in illusions. He told the working classes 
frankly that they must not expect too much from 
parliamentary reform, and he refuted the doctrine 
that war was good because it furnished employment 
and made trade brisk. He would not have working 
men suppose that any nostrum or political arrange- 
ment could ever save them from the responsibility of 
qualifying themselves by their own industry and 
intelligence for a larger share of the comfort and 
social advantages of life. Some of his articles in the 
defunct Register and in the Sheffield Courant were 
republished by Stanley in a supplementary volume 
of Miscellaneous Works. They may still be read 
with interest by any one who desires to study the 
economic history as well as the temper of the times. 
For example, he dwelt on the natural tendency of 
wealth to become richer and poverty poorer. The 
effect of wealth, he said, was to make men more 
alive to intellectual pleasures and more able to pro- 
cure them, while poverty renders the same pleasures 
at once undesired and unattainable. In this way the 
two classes of our community have been removed 
from one another by a greater distance, and have 
become strangers, if not enemies. The excess of
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 THOMAS ARNOLD 
aristocracy in our whole system—religious, political, 
and social —had led to an enormous evil, though it 
was hard to say that any one was to blame for it. 
The rich and poor have each a distinct language, 
the language of the rich being that of books, and 
being full of French words derived from Roman 
ancestors, while that of the poor retained its Anglo- 
Saxon character. 
“Our business,” he said, “is to raise all and lower none. 
Equality is the dream of a madman, or the passion of a fiend. 
Extreme inequality, or high comfort and civilization in some, 
coexisting with deep misery and degradation in others, is no 
less also a folly anda sin. But an equality in which some 
have all the enjoyments of civilized life, and none are with- 
out its comforts, where some have all the treasures of know- 
ledge, and none are sunk in ignorance, —that is a social 
system in harmony with the order of God’s creation in the 
natural world.”? 
There were other public movements which were 
not political and were of a more hopeful kind. Lord 
Brougham, whose reforming zeal made him many 
enemies, and whose restless and versatile energy 
alienated many who were disposed to sympathize 
with his measures, had, as early as 1816, distin- 
guished himself in Parliament by setting on foot the 
first enquiry into the “abuses of the public charitable 
foundations connected with education,” and had also 
initiated another enquiry into the state of education 
in the metropolis. Failing, after repeated efforts, to 
arouse Parliament to any strong interest in the sub-

  SOCIETY FOR THE DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE 125 
ject, he, in 1825, allied himself with Romilly, Lord 
John Russell, W. Tooke, James Mill, Henry Hallam, 
M. D. Hill, Sir Charles Bell, Bishop Maltby of Durham, 
William Allen, and other prominent Whigs, in the 
establishment of a voluntary Society for the Diffusion 
of Useful Knowledge. In 1828 the society was able 
to congratulate its supporters on the success “which 
had attended its efforts to make the most useful and 
the most exalted truths of science easily and gener- 
ally accessible.” In that year Charles Knight became 
the recognized publisher, and up to the year 1846, 
when the society came to an end, a succession of 
treatises and tracts appeared which undoubtedly had 
a most stimulating effect on the intellectual life of 
the working classes, and especially on the class im- 
mediately above them. Very eminent writers were 
engaged. Brougham himself contributed the opening 
treatise on the “objects, advantages, and pleasures of 
science.” Dr. Lardner, Sir James Mackintosh, Pro- 
fessor Malden, were among the other contributors. 
The Library of Useful Knowledge, the Penny Cyclo- 
pedia, which appeared at first in penny weekly 
numbers, the Library of Entertaining Knowledge, 
and the Penny Magazine, which was the pioneer of 
many periodicals of mingled instruction and en- 
tertainment, were all new experiments in popular 
literature, and were welcomed by many good men as 
enterprises of high value and far-reaching influence. 
A kindred effort, mainly helped forward by the 
same persons, was the establishment by Dr. Birkbeck, 
in 1820, of the first Mechanics’ Institution in London. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 THOMAS ARNOLD 
The example was widely followed in the provincial 
towns. Classes, reading rooms, and libraries were 
provided, courses of lectures on science were ar- 
ranged, and great efforts were made to popularize 
knowledge and to attract working men to the Insti- 
tutes. Under different names— Literary Institutes, 
Polytechnics, Evening Continuation Classes — the 
Mechanics’ Institute survives in full and beneficial 
activity to our own day; but it should not be forgotten 
that the first serious attempt in England to provide in 
the evening for those who had been laboriously engaged 
during the day, means and appliances for intellectual 
culture was made by Brougham, Birkbeck, and the 
promoters of the “Diffusion Society.” 
A still more ambitious enterprise was the founda- 
tion, in 1828, of an institution intended to serve as 
a University for London. At that time religious 
tests were enforced at the older Universities prac- 
tically excluding from the benefits of those founda- 
tions all who felt unable or unwilling to sign 
the thirty-nine articles. The expense of living at 
Oxford or Cambridge placed their advantages out of 
the reach of many poor students; and before the 
creation of railways, even the distance of these 
centres of learning from the metropolis was felt to 
be a disadvantage. In these circumstances Thomas 
Campbell, the poet, had published, in 1825, a letter 
addressed to Lord Brougham, earnestly advocating 
the establishment in London of a great University for 
“teaching, examining, exercising, and rewarding with 
honours in the liberal arts and sciences the youth of
-P-A-G-E-139
THE LONDON UNIVERSITY 127 
our middling rich people,” —a University combining 
the advantages of public and private education, the 
emulative spirit produced “by examination before 
numbers, and by honours conferred before the pub- 
lic, the cheapness of domestic residence, and all the 
moral influences that result from home.” Shares 
representing £160,000 were taken up, and in 1827 
the foundation of the new building in Gower Street 
was laid by the king’s brother, the Duke of Sussex. 
For a time that institution, though it failed to obtain 
power from the Crown to confer degrees, was known 
as the London University, and it was not until 1836, 
after King’s College had been founded, that the long 
negotiations with the Government were terminated 
by an arrangement which conferred upon each of those 
Colleges a charter recognizing it as a teaching body; 
and at the same time incorporated by Charter a third 
body, to be called the “ University of London,” with 
power to examine candidates from those and other 
affiliated colleges, and to confer academic degrees in 
any branch of learning or science except theology. 
In all these enterprises Arnold had the keenest 
interest. They seemed to him to be full of promise 
for the intellectual emancipation and improvement of 
the whole English people, and he threw himself into 
them with characteristic vehemence and enthusiasm. 
He was in full sympathy with the objects which the 
promoters of the Diffusion Society, the Mechanics’ 
Institutes, and the London University had in view, 
but he was not without grave misgivings about the 
methods they adopted. He could not withhold sym- 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
128 THOMAS ARNOLD 
pathy from the educational reformers, although what 
Sir G. Trevelyan has somewhat happily called Brough- 
am’s “slovenly omniscience” caused that sympathy 
to be imperfect. The arid and limited conception of 
“Useful Knowledge,” knowledge sought because of 
its visible relation to practical uses, could not be 
expected to satisfy him. The publications of the 
“Diffusion ” Society dealt mainly with scientific facts 
and interesting information, and left almost wholly 
out of view the culture of the imagination and the 
taste. ‘There was a singular absence from the So- 
ciety’s programme of the humaner studies, literature, 
art, logic, ethics, poetry, and philosophy. But these 
defects, though serious, were in his view not the 
worst. There was, he thought, an indifference to 
religion characterizing the publications of the Society, 
and this chilled and disheartened him most. It was 
one of his deepest convictions, that while the educa- 
tion of an Englishman need not be sectarian, it should 
be essentially Christian. “The slightest touch of 
Christian principle and Christian hope, in the Soci- 
ety’s biographical and historical articles,” he said in 
one of his letters, “would be a sort of living salt to 
the whole.” And in another letter he described the 
sort of literature which he should like to furnish to 
the working men of England as “Cobbett-like in 
style, but Christian in spirit.” “I never wanted 
articles on religious subjects half so much as articles 
on common subjects written with a decidedly Chris- 
tian tone.” And his enthusiasm in favour of direct- 
ing these new and promising agencies for mental
-P-A-G-E-141
THE PENNY MAGAZINE 129 
improvement into a course which should recognize 
the moral and spiritual needs of the nation, took a 
very practical shape when, in writing to one of the 
officers of the Diffusion Society, he said: 
“T am convinced that if the Penny Magazine were decid- 
edly and avowedly Christian, many of the clergy throughout 
the kingdom would be most delighted to assist its circulation 
by every means in their power. For myself, I should think 
that I could not do too much to contribute to the support of 
what would then be so great a national blessing, and I should 
beg to be allowed to offer fifty pounds annually towards it so 
long as my remaining in my present situation enabled me to 
gratify my inclinations to that extent.” 
The offer was not accepted. It is difficult, indeed, 
to conceive how an arrangement, such as Arnold 
desired, could be formulated and rendered permanent 
without raising in the Society many formidable theo- 
logical difficulties. To Arnold himself, who saw his 
way clearly to the preparation of articles which would 
fulfil his own ideal, the difficulties seemed to be 
trifling. The Committee of the Society, however, 
formed a truer estimate of the public interpretation 
which would be put on his plan, and determined to 
adhere resolutely to the course they had from the 
first adopted. They resolved to make intellectual 
improvement and useful knowledge their main busi- 
ness, leaving to other agencies all discussions on 
disputable theology and on morals and religion. 
Their activity in publication did not slacken, but 
they worked under limitations which, even to Arnold, 
appeared to be harmful, and which caused a large 
K

  180 THOMAS ARNOLD 
number of the ministers of religion to regard the 
* Society with scant sympathy and some suspicion to 
the last. The Saturday Magazine, which was pub- 
lished by the Society for promoting Christian Know- 
ledge, was considered by many as the rival, and by 
others as the antidote to the Penny Magazine, and 
secured a large circulation. Arnold said toa member 
of that Society: ~ 
“T have had some correspondence with the Useful Know- 
ledge people about their Penny Magazine, and have sent them 
some things which I am waiting to see if they will publish ; 
but of course what I have been doing, and may do, for them 
does not hinder me from doing what I can for you. I only 
suspect that I should want to liberalize your magazine, as I 
wish to Christianize theirs, and probably your Committee 
would recalcitrate against any such operation, as theirs may 
do. The Christian Knowledge Society has a bad name for 
the dulness of its publications, and their contributions to the 
cause of general knowledge, and enlightening the people in 
earnest, may seem a little tardy and reluctant.”* 
The Useful Knowledge Society came to an end in 
1846. It was an honourable and undoubtédly suc- 
cessful effort to promote the better education of the 
people, and the influence of its publications long sur- 
vived its own death. If its promoters proved to be 
too sanguine, if later experience showed that they 
made an inaccurate estimate both of the appetite of 
the working man for intellectual nutriment and of 
the character of the nutriment to be provided, the par- 
tial failure of the enterprise is nowise to their dis-

MECHANICS’ INSTITUTES 181 
credit. At least it blocked up one of the roads to 
future failure, and did much to make later educa- 
tional progress possible. But Arnold’s interest in 
the larger work of Dr. Birkbeck was not diminished 
by this partial failure. His lecture on the divisions 
and mutual relation of knowledge, delivered before 
the Mechanics’ Institute at Rugby, shows at the same 
time his sympathy with the promoters of such insti- 
tutions and his desire to improve the ideal of “useful 
knowledge” which was to a large extent presented to 
the working classes in the lectures to which they 
were accustomed. He expressed an earnest wish to 
encourage Mechanics’ Institutes on account of the 
good that they can do, and at the same time he 
deemed it important to call attention to their neces- 
sary imperfections and to notice the good which they 
cannot do, There is in this lecture little or no refer- 
ence to the merely material or commercial value of 
knowledge, but an attempt to enlarge his hearers’ 
conception of the worth of mental cultivation as a 
means of enriching life and adding to its power and 
usefulness. Hence he dwells much on the need of 
such studies as philosophy, languages, and logic, as 
helping to foster a love of truth, and to qualify the 
student to think more soundly and accurately about 
any of the subjects in which he might become inter- 
ested, especially those which concerned most nearly 
the duties of the citizen and the formation of right 
opinions about the past and the future. 
In 1836, he was invited to a seat on the Senate of 
the newly constituted University of London, and he
-P-A-G-E-144
  1382 THOMAS ARNOLD 
accepted the post with much alacrity, believing that 
here was a new opportunity for usefulness and a 
promising instrument for extending the blessings of 
a liberal education to many persons who had hitherto 
been excluded from academic privileges. One of the 
first proposals which he submitted to the Senate was 
to the effect that an acquaintance with some part of 
the New Testament in the original should be required 
of every candidate for a degree in Arts. For degrees 
in Law and Medicine he was not disposed to insist on 
this condition. But a degree in Arts, he contended, 
ought to certify that the holder had received a com- 
plete and liberal education; and a liberal education 
without the Scriptures must, in any Christian coun- 
try, be a contradiction in terms. Of theoretic diffi- 
culties in the conduct of the examination he made 
very light. 
“T am perfectly ready,” he said, “to examine to-morrow 
in any Unitarian School in England, in presence of parents 
and masters. I will not put a question that shall offend, 
yet I will give such an examination as will bring out, or 
prove the absence of, Christian knowledge of the highest 
value. I speak as one who has been used to examine young 
men in the Scriptures for nearly twenty years, and I pledge 
myself to the perfect easiness of doing this. Our examina- 
tions, in fact, will carry their own security with them if our 
characters will not, and we should not and could not venture 
to proselytize even if we wished it. But this very circum- 
stance of our having joined the London University at the 
risk of much odium from a large part of our profession would 
be a warrant for our entering into the spirit of the Charter 
with perfect sincerity.”?

  SCRIPTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON 133 
These views, however, were not accepted by his 
colleagues on the Senate, many of whom saw with 
greater clearness than he how difficult it would be to 
secure a succession of Arnolds as Scripture examiners, 
and how many promising and conscientious students 
might possibly be excluded from the University, if 
the religious examination were insisted on. 
Accordingly, his proposal that every candidate for 
the degree of B.A. should be required to take up one 
of the Gospels or Epistles at his discretion was re- 
jected. But in deference to his judgment and that of 
the minority who sympathized with him, a voluntary 
or supplementary examination was instituted in the 
Hebrew Text of the Old Testament, the Greek Text 
of the New Testament, and Scripture History and Evi- 
dences, and special prizes and certificates were offered 
to successful candidates. The regulations for this 
examination are still in force in the scheme of the 
London University and are an interesting survival 
testifying to Arnold’s influence. But the annual 
number of candidates is small, and the certificates in 
this department of knowledge do not count in any 
way towards the attainment of a degree. Though 
keenly regretting that the principle for which he had 
contended did not obtain the approval of the Senate, 
Arnold yet continued for a time to serve as a member 
of that body, partly because he did not wish to cen- 
sure even by implication those Bishops and clergy 
who still felt it their duty to remain, and partly in 
the hope of making the Scriptural examination as 
attractive and effective as possible, and perhaps of

so regulating its conditions that the Arts degree 
would be generally understood to be incomplete with- 
out it. When it afterwards became evident that 
neither the authorities of the affiliated Colleges, nor 
those of the University itself, shared his belief in the 
necessity of such an examination, or were disposed 
to regard it in any other light than as a purely volun- 
tary exercise, he abandoned the contest, and in a 
sorrowful and dignified letter addressed to the Chan- 
cellor at the end of 1838, he finally resigned all con- 
nexion with the University.

Ir will easily be gathered from the foregoing pages 
that Arnold was likely to feel profoundly interested 
in the remarkable religious revival, which under the 
name of the Oxford movement made the fourth decade 
of this century so memorable in the history of the 
English Church. Indeed, any estimate of his charac- 
ter and career would be incomplete which did not 
include some reference to his share in that movement. 
Some of his old associates of the Oriel set, including 
Keble, Hurrell Froude, Pusey, Rose, Newman, and 
others, were led by the study of Church History and 
by a profound distrust of the current theology of the 
day, to assume a new position and to be recognized 
as par eacellence the Anglican party in the English 
church. In 1827 Keble published his Christian Year, 
a volume of which Pusey afterwards said, that “it 
was the unknown dawn and harbinger of the reawak- 
ening of deeper truth.” In 1833, Newman began the 
195
-P-A-G-E-148
  136 THOMAS ARNOLD 
publication of Tracts for the Times, with the avowed 
object of withstanding the liberalism of the day, and 
of finding a basis for the English church in Catho- 
lic antiquity, and strengthening the sacerdotal and 
sacramental elements in her teaching.' In 1835, 
Pusey started the Library of the Fathers. The 
series of Tracts came to an end in 1841 with the pub- 
lication of Tract 90, which was a laboured argument 
to prove that the articles of the Church of England 
admitted of a Catholic interpretation. This tract was 
censured by Bishops and by the Heads of Houses at 
Oxford, and was received with such a storm of in- 
dignation that the publication of the Tracts proceeded 
no further. The subsequent submission of Newman 
to the Roman Catholic Church in 1845 was the catas- 
trophe of the movement. 
The story of this movement has been told with 
singular candour, clearness, and dignity, and with 
touching pathos by John Henry Newman, the pro- 
tagonist of the drama, in his Apologia pro vitd sud; 
and from another point of view, with no less fair- 
ness and scarcely less literary charm, in Dean Church’s 
Oxford Movement. It must suffice here to refer to 
such of the incidents of that eventful time as 
specially interested Arnold and called forth his com- 
bative instincts. Dr. R.D. Hampden, who was public 
examiner in Oxford in 1831-1832, became Bampton 
lecturer in the following year, and in that capacity 
preached a course of lectures on the “Scholastic 
Philosophy considered in its relations to Christian 
1 Apologia, pp. 150 and 195,
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE HAMPDEN CONTROVERSY 137 
Theology.” It was a scholarly though not very 
inspiring book; it traced the influence of the Alex- 
andrine divines and of the schoolmen on the forma- 
tion of the Christian Creeds, and would in our days 
have been regarded as a thoughtful and useful contri- 
bution to Church History, without startling any one 
by its originality or daring speculation. But by the 
High Church and Tory party in Oxford the book 
was then regarded as dangerously latitudinarian in 
its opinions, chiefly because it exhibited with re- 
morseless frankness the very human elements which 
entered into the composition of ancient formularies, 
such as the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds, and so 
might tend to deprive them of that divine author- 
ity which high Anglicans were wont to claim for 
them. The book was solemnly condemned by the 
Heads of Houses as unorthodox and dangerous, and 
when Lord Melbourne, in 1836, proposed to appoint 
Hampden to the Regius Professorship of Divinity, a 
strong and acrimonious opposition to the appointment 
arose in Oxford. The Prime Minister, however, per- 
sisted in the nomination, and the only practical effect 
of the agitation was by a vote in Convocation to 
exclude the Regius Professor from his place at a 
Board whose duty it was to nominate University 
preachers.? 
1It was not till after Arnold’s death that the same controversy 
was revived in an aggravated form by the nomination in 1847, of 
Hampden to the bishopric of Hereford —a nomination which Lord 
John Russell, the minister of the day, persisted in, notwithstanding 
remonstrances from the clergy, from the Dean of Hereford, and 
from thirteen of the bishops.
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 THOMAS ARNOLD 
It was not to be expected that Arnold could keep 
silent in the midst of this ecclesiastical ferment. He 
was “ever a fighter,” and in regard to questions which 
touched the interests of religion a strong and even 
vehement controversialist. He threw himself with 
characteristic courage and energy into the thickest of 
the fray. Of what has been cynically called the 
* “nasty little virtue of prudence,” it must be owned 
he was not endowed with a large share. He wrote, 
in 1829, a pamphlet strongly urging the wisdom and 
expediency of conceding the Catholic claims. He 
stayed not to consider whether the outspoken utter- 
ance of unpopular opinion would injure his reputation 
with the governors of the school; and as we have 
already shown, he refused with courtesy, but with 
firmness, a request from one of the Rugby trustees 
that he would declare whether he was or was not the 
author of an anonymous article in a Review. Free- 
dom to speak his mind on burning questions was a 
necessity of his being, and he would readily have 
resigned his mastership, had it been necessary, rather 
than surrender this freedom. That a cause was for 
the moment unpopular, was with him almost a prima 
facie reason for espousing it, 
Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa Catoni. 
His famous article in the Edinburgh Review, enti- 
tled the “Oxford Malignants,”? is an example of his 
1 These were the five members of a small committee which met 
in the common room at Corpus to draw up a protest against Hamp- 
den’s appointment as Regius Professor, on the ground that “‘he had 
contradicted the doctrinal truths which he was pledged to main- 
tain.”” Eighty-one members of the University signed this protest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY 139 
polemical style when specially roused to indignation; 
and his knowledge of history caused him to feel how 
impotent was the attempt to prevent the spread of 
opinions, whether really or only apparently hetero- 
dox, by means of ecclesiastical censures. 
“He wielded a pen,”’ said J. B. Mozley, “as if it 
were a ferule.” The violent proceedings of the New- 
manite party against Hampden were, in his opinion, 
glaringly unjust. He saw in the privilegiwm voted by 
Convocation nothing but Lynch law. He saw in it 
a reproduction in spirit and in essence of the non- 
jurors reviling Burnet, of the Council of Constance 
condemning Huss, of the Judaizers banded together 
against Paul.' 
As one reads the story of those days, he is reminded 
of the terms in which Matthew Arnold, many years 
afterwards, apostrophized Oxford as the “home of 
lost causes and forsaken beliefs, and unpopular 
names, and impossible loyalties.”? Father and son 
were alike in loving Oxford dearly, and were con- 
scious of their deep and lifelong debt to it. But to 
both, the influence of the High Church party appeared 
profoundly mischievous to the true interests of reli- 
gion and to the welfare and full development of the 
Church’s usefulness. Indeed, Arnold almost despaired 
of the Church of England, although he believed that 
it ought to become the main instrument for the moral 
culture of the nation and for the exaltation of right- 
eousness and truth. The decorous and apologetic

orthodoxy of the eighteenth century, the negligence 
and apathy of many of the clergy, and their isolation 
from the main current of popular interests, repelled 
and profoundly saddened him. “Our Church,” he 
said, “bears, and has ever borne, the marks of her 
birth. The child of royal and aristocratic selfishness 
and unprincipled tyranny, she has never dared to speak 
boldly to the great, but has contented herself with 
lecturing the poor. ‘I will speak of thy testimonies 
even before kings, and will not be ashamed,’ is a text 
of which the Anglican Church as a national institu- 
tion has never caught the spirit.” The fact that 
twenty-two out of twenty-four bishops voted in 
the House of Lords against the Reform Bill was 
well calculated to arouse the sceva indignatio which, 
when occasion arose, was so easily excited in him. 
Here was no case in which the religious interests of 
the people needed to be safeguarded by the spiritual 
peers. But the incident brought into strong relief 
the fatal tendency of English ecclesiastics to identify 
themselves with the interests of the privileged classes, 
and seemed to Arnold to render the outlook for the 
future more dispiriting than ever. 
In these circumstances, the new signs of life and 
energy which the leaders of the Oxford movement 
were beginning to put forth, and the desire of that 
party to emancipate itself from political trammels, 
might have been expected to win Arnold’s sym- 
pathy. But in his view the whole of that movement 
was Vitiated by the sacerdotal pretensions and claims 
of some of the clergy, by their revival of some medie-

val and outworn superstitions, and by their habit of 
regarding the acceptance of dogmas as the only basis of 
Christianity. He had learned from Coleridge a larger 
conception of the scope and office of a Christian 
church, whose members should include many of those 
now called dissenters, and whose ministers should 
form a clerisy —not exclusively teachers of theol- 
ogy, but leaders and helpers in all that concerned 
the intellectual interests and the social life of the 
people, in wise philanthropy and in practical reli- 
gion.1| Dean Church thus defines what he conceives 
to have been Arnold’s position at the time: 
“Dr, Arnold’s view of the Church was very simple. He 
divided the world into Christians and non-Christians. Chris- 
tians were all who professed to believe in Christ as a divine 
person, and to worship him; and the brotherhood — the 
‘Societas’ of Christians — was all that was meant by the 
Church in the New Testament. It mattered of course to 
the conscience of each Christian what he had made up his 
mind to believe, but to no one else. Church organization 
was according to circumstances partly inevitable or expe- 
dient, partly mischievous, but in no case of divine authority. 
Teaching, ministering the word, was a thing of divine ap- 
pointment, but not so the mode of exercising it, either as to 
persons, forms, or methods. Sacraments there were, signs 
and pledges of divine love and help in every action of life, in 
every sight of nature, and eminently two most touching 
ones recommended to Christians by the Redeemer himself ; 
but except as a matter of mere order, one man might deal 
with them as lawfully as another.” ?

  142 THOMAS ARNOLD 
He advocated the abolition of tests in the Universi- 
ties, the opening of the church’s doors to the admis- 
sion of dissenters, the abandonment of the practice 
of translating Bishops from one diocese to another, 
the equalization of incomes, the formation of new 
parishes, and the revival of the order of deacons. 
But his utterances on these subjects were not accept- 
able to any party in the English church, and it pained 
and distressed him to find how many enemies he 
made. One of those parties appeared to him narrow, 
timid, and at the same time fanatical in their Bibli- 
olatry and their demands for evangelical orthodoxy, 
and another to be putting forth personal claims to 
priestly authority which he regarded as wholly alien 
to the spirit of Christianity. At any rate, he received 
little sympathy from either. “If I had two necks,” 
he said, “I should have a good chance of being hanged 
by both sides.” His unpopularity was shown by the 
refusal of the Archbishop of Canterbury to allow him 
to preach the sermon at Lambeth on the consecration 
of Stanley, the Bishop of Norwich. His attitude 
towards the reforming party in the Church on the 
one hand, and to the older orthodoxy on the other, 
reminds one of that of Erasmus, who though sympa- 
thizing with Luther in his denunciation of negligence, 
corruption, and superstition, was unwilling to weaken 
the Church or to deny her primitive teaching. “In- 
stead of leading,” Erasmus sadly complains, “I have 
stood naked and unarmed between the javelins of two 
angry foes.” 
It would appear that he had formed an ideal of a
-P-A-G-E-155
  RELATION OF CHURCH TO STATE 143 
Christian state organized on some such model as his 
own school at Rugby, with a chief magistrate, ener- 
getic, God-fearing, and wise, with the clergy and 
aristocracy a sort of sixth form, exercising large 
influence in the repression of evil and encouragement 
of good, and a whole community not necessarily 
holding one set of opinions, but willing to share the 
same worship and to work together as the servants of 
the same Divine Master. Neither in a State nor in 
his school was he disposed to regard uniformity as 
the test of excellence. In his opinion intellectual 
freedom, and diversity in creed and organization were 
wholly compatible with unity of Christian purpose 
and with corporate national life. 
It would be foreign to my present purpose to enter 
further into details respecting Arnold’s religious life, 
and his strivings against what seemed to him the 
worldliness of the Church and in favour of wider 
Christian comprehension. “The identity of the 
Christian commonwealth with the Christian state 
was the vision that had inspired the ecclesiastical 
polity of Hooker. It was the ruling thought of 
Selden’s grave sense, of Burke’s high political phi- 
losophy, and of the religious philosophy of Cole- 
ridge.”' To this may be added that it had been the 
dream of Chillingworth, and has been, in different 
forms, that of Arthur Stanley, of Frederick Maurice, 
of Whateley, of Bunsen and of Jowett, of Phillips 
Brooks, the late Bishop of Massachusetts, and of 
many another large-souled man who sought to make

144 THOMAS ARNOLD 
Christian men lay aside minor differences and agree 
to combine together in religious sympathy, in the 
advancement of righteousness, and in strenuous 
Christian work. But it is a dream which has never 
been realized, and, so far as we can see, after more 
than half a century, is not likely to be realized. 
Arnold believed that so long as the only unity the 
churches can understand means uniformity of belief 
and opinion, and not identity in moral and spiritual 
aim; so long as the battle of the sects is a fight for 
creeds rather than a war against sin and ignorance, 
unity is simply impossible in any country in which 
there is any intellectual life at all. While each sec- 
tion of the Christian community attaches more 
importance to the dogmas and usages by which that 
section is distinguished from the rest, than to the 
fundamental aims in which they are all practically 
agreed, every effort to secure greater comprehensive- 
ness in the Church and unity in Christendom seems 
foredoomed to failure. And those who shared his 
views must have sorrowfully admitted that in this 
matter Arnold was only beating the air, and that the 
problem he mused over and vehemently discussed is, 
for the present at least, insoluble. Yet something 
will survive, — something always does survive from 
honest striving after a generous and noble, even 
if an unattainable, ideal. When much that is 
ephemeral in theological controversy is forgotten, 
the aspirations of those who have sought to discover 
a deeper foundation for spiritual unity than that 
of ecclesiastical creeds and systems will abide as

EXTRA-SCHOLASTIC INTERESTS 145 
permanent factors in the history of religion. To 
men with such aspirations it is a relief to turn from 
the polemics of rival schools, from the Oxford move- 
ment, from Tract Ninety, from discussions about the 
Hampden controversy or the Eastward position, to 
the calm and gracious utterances of one who said: 
“Other sheep I have which are not of this fold. 
Them also must I bring, and they shall hear my voice 
and there shall be one flock and one Shepherd.” 
No apology is needed, even in a book mainly 
addressed to teachers, for dwelling with so much 
detail on the extra-scholastic aspects of Arnold’s life. 
For indeed, the influence of a schoolmaster is largely 
conditioned by the pursuits and tastes which charac- 
terize him out of school, and by the nature of his 
outlook into the life on which his pupils are about to 
embark. His love of foreign travel served to illu- 
minate his lessons, to increase his descriptive power, 
and to help boys better to know something of the 
world, and of their own place in it. His historical 
imagination enabled him to arouse their sympathies 
for the great men of old and their aspirations after 
the nobler kinds of fame and success. His insatiable 
thirst for knowledge kept his mind fresh and recep- 
tive, made the life of the scholar more attractive in 
the eyes of the boys, and prevented him from losing 
touch with young learners, to whom all knowledge 
was new. His militant political liberalism, though not 
obtruded in school, could not fail to leaven a commun- 
ity largely composed of the sons of rich men, and it 
unconsciously helped them to become aware of their 
L  
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 THOMAS ARNOLD 
duties to the unprivileged classes, especially to the 
poor and the ignorant. His domestic life, in a sin- 
gularly happy and tranquil home, kept his affections 
pure and tender, and caused him to bring the intui- 
tions of a parent to rectify his merely professional 
knowledge of boys and their capacities, their needs, 
and their dangers. Above all, the profound reli- 
giousness of his nature and his solemn sense of duty 
coloured the whole of his acts and thoughts, and gave 
to all those who came most under his influence an 
almost premature sense of the seriousness of life and 
of the responsibilities of Christian manhood. 
Thus his life reveals to us the manifold and varied 
nature of the equipment of a true teacher. Scholar- 
ship alone is but a part, and not necessarily the 
highest part, of that equipment. Strong will and 
force of character are great and indeed indispensa- 
ble endowments for a head master. Physical activ- 
ity and abounding hopefulness are not less needed. 
All these Arnold possessed. “I suppose,” he once 
said, “the desirable feeling to entertain is always 
to expect to succeed, and never to think you have 
succeeded.” But more is necessary to make the 
ideal teacher. He needs an insight into child 
nature and into the processes by which truth can 
be communicated, faith in the boundless possibilities 
of good which lie even in the most unpromising and 
uninteresting scholars, a deep sympathy with every 
form of youthful weakness except sin, and a genuine 
enthusiasm and love for work. The best teacher in 
the world must always fall short in some respects of 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  PROFESSORSHIP OF MODERN HISTORY 147 
this ideal; but it was because Arnold ever kept it in 
view, and strove with all his might to realize it, that 
his name will long remain in our history as that of a 
great schoolmaster, who ennobled his profession, and 
fulfilled, though in a way hardly anticipated by 
Hawkins, the remarkable prophecy that he would 
transform the public schools of England. 
One of the most gratifying incidents of his life was 
his appointment, in 1842, to the Regius Professorship 
of Modern History at Oxford. The compliment thus 
paid to him was peculiarly welcome. It was an 
honourable recognition of his eminent industry and 
success in his favourite field of research; it renewed 
his connexion with his beloved Oxford; it brought 
around him once more many of his former friends; 
and it served to soften, if not to obliterate, the 
memories of some personal controversies. A con- 
temporary letter of R.W. Church, afterwards Dean 
of St. Paul’s, who was living at Oriel, in February, 
1842, describes vividly the impression left upon a 
young and not wholly sympathetic College don of 
that period. 
“The great lion at present is Arnold and his lectures which 
have created a great stir in the exalted, the literary, and the 
fashionable world of Oxford. He is here with his whole 
family, and people look forward to his lectures in the theatre 
day after day, as they might to a play. He will be quite 
missed when he goes. Almost every Head goes with his 
wife and daughters, if he has any, and so powerful is Arnold’s 
eloquence, that the Master of Balliol was, on one occasion, 
quite overcome, and fairly went — not quite into hysterics,
-P-A-G-E-160
148 THOMAS ARNOLD 
but into tears—upon which the Provost remarked at a 
large party, that he supposed it was the gout.” 
“However, they are very striking lectures. He is work- 
ing out his inaugural. Everything he does, he does with 
life and force, and I cannot help liking his manly and open 
way, and the great reality which he throws about such 
things as description of country, military laws and opera- 
tions, and such like low concerns. He has exercised on the 
whole a generous forbearance towards us and let us off with 
a few angular points about Priesthood and the Puritans in 
one lecture, while he has been immensely lioeral in other 
ways, and I should think not to the taste of the Capitular 
body, e.g. puffing with all his might the magnificent age 
and intensely interesting contests of Innocent III, and in 
allowing any one to believe, without any suspicion of super- 
stition, a very great many of Bede’s miracles and some others 
besides.” * 
The lectures on Modern History, fragmentary and 
incomplete as they are, serve well to illustrate the 
character of Arnold’s mind. He was, as it has been 
said, an “insatiable reader, an active controversial- 
ist, in whose view every series of phenomena natu- 
rally erystallized into a theory.” The province of 
history, the characteristics of historical style, mili- 
tary ethics, military geography, national prejudices, 
religious and political parties in England, are among 
the topics rather glanced at than discussed in these 
lectures.? His first intention was to begin with the 
year 1400, in the hope of doing for England a similar 
service to that which Guizot had then undertaken to “

do for France. He meant to trace the change of 
property produced by the Wars of the Roses, and the 
growth of the English aristocracy, as it gradually 
superseded in power the aristocracy of purely Nor- 
man descent. He afterwards abandoned the plan 
and began at an earlier date. The statutes required 
that terminal lectures on biography should be given in 
connexion with the historical courses, and this was 
a requirement peculiarly congenial to Arnold, and in 
conformity with his own method of instruction. He 
had always held that the way to vivify history and 
make it impressive and useful was to connect it with 
the lives and characters of typical men. So he 
planned a series of discourses on Gregory the Great, 
Charlemagne, Alfred, Dante, and other representative 
men of the pre-Reformation period. But these vis- 
ions were never realized. The first course of profes- 
sorial lectures proved to be his last. 
The end came suddenly. On the morning of Sun- 
day, the 12th of June, 1842, the day before his 
forty-seventh birthday, he succumbed to a sharp 
attack of angina pectoris, the disease from which his 
father had died. Of the shock and bewilderment 
which this event caused in his household, and 
throughout the little community of Rugby, Dean 
Stanley’s pages contain a touching description, which 
could not properly be simplified or shortened or re- 
produced here. Of those whom he left behind him, 
Jane, the eldest daughter, became the wife of Will- 
iam Edward Forster, afterwards M.P. for Bradford 
and Vice-President of the Committee of Council on

Education; Matthew was the eldest son; Thomas, 
the second son, became a Fellow of his college at 
Oxford, and has devoted himself to literary and 
educational work; William Delafield Arnold was for 
a time director of public instruction in the Punjaub, 
and died on his way homewards in 1859; and Edward 
was a clergyman and inspector of schools. In the 
next generation, Mrs. Humphry Ward, the gifted 
daughter of Thomas, and the author of Robert Els- 
mere, and Mr. H. O. Arnold Forster, M.P. for Belfast, 
the son of W. D. Arnold, have in different ways 
achieved honourable reputation. 
Speculation in reference to what Arnold’s future 
career might have been were obviously fruitless. Not 
improbably he would have become a liberal Bishop, 
and it may be conjectured that in that capacity he 
might have grown more tolerant of extreme opinions 
and have found out the use which the Church may 
make of extreme men. But it is hardly to be be- 
lieved that he would have ever been reconciled to the 
developments of modern ritualism. Still less was he 
likely to be satisfied with the sacerdotal claims of 
the clergy, or with the belief that the Anglicanism 
of the thirty-nine articles represented the final stage 
in the development of the Christian church. There 
is a remarkable passage in a letter of Matthew 
Arnold to his mother in 1862, in which, speaking of 
the Colenso controversy and the timid and apologetic 
character of the orthodox defence, he says: 
“T do not think it possible for a clergyman to treat these 
matters satisfactorily. In Papa’s time it was so, but it is
-P-A-G-E-163
  
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 151 
so, it seems to me, no longer. He is the last free speaker of 
the Church of England, who speaks without being shackled, 
and without being aware that he is so and that he is in a 
false position in consequence: the moment a writer feels this 
his power is gone. I may add that if a clergyman does not 
feel this now he ought to feel it. The best of them, Jowett 
for example, obviously do feel it. I am quite sure Papa 
would have felt it had he been living now and thirty years 
younger. Not that he would have been less a Christian, or 
less zealous for a National Church, but his attention would 
have been painfully awake to the truth that to profess to see 
Christianity through the spectacles of a number of second or 
third rate men who lived in Queen Elizabeth’s time (and this 
is what office-holders under the thirty-nine articles do), men 
whose works one never dreams of reading for the purpose of 
enlightening and edifying one’s self, is an intolerable absurdity 
and that it is time to put the formularies of the Church of 
England on a solider basis.” 
Of one thing we may be sure, that any increased 
influence which he might have obtained later would 
have been used with an honest endeavour to reconcile 
the working classes to the Church, and to make the 
gulf which separates them from what is called 
“society” a little narrower and less perilous. As 
Professor at Oxford he would doubtless have made 
substantial contributions to historical and biographi- 
cal literature, and although he would soon have 
ceased to be a schoolmaster, he would have continued 
to exercise great influence as a governor of schools, 
and as a speaker in conferences, in the pulpit, and 
possibly in the House of Lords, on subjects connected 
with the improvement of our public schools. Books

on the philosophy or methods of education it was not 
in him to write, but he would certainly have found 
means to keep in public view the principles of dis- 
cipline and instruction which he had sought to 
exemplify at Rugby. The new claims of the physical 
sciences for recognition as substantial parts of a 
system of liberal education in the Universities and 
public schools would have been received by him with 
respect, but not with enthusiasm. They would to 
the last have seemed to him inferior in weight to 
the older claims of the “humanities” — language, 
letters, history, and philosophy — to form the staple 
of a gentleman’s education. : 
Nor can it be doubted that, had his life been pro- 
longed, the later developments of popular instruction 
would have interested him keenly, on personal as 
well as on public grounds. His solicitude to extend 
the blessings of education to the poorer classes was 
with him a passion, which later events and contro- 
versies would have done much to intensify. Kay 
Shuttleworth, Lord John Russell, William Allen, 
Lord Lansdowne, and Bishop Stanley of Norwich 
would have found in him an energetic ally. And none 
who followed with any care the discussions, in 1870, 
on the introduction of the Education Act, and who 
marked the far-seeing and generous spirit in which 
that measure was conducted through Parliament by 
Mr. W. E. Forster, the Vice-President of the Council, 
could fail to be conscious of the happy influence which 
had descended from Rugby upon that statesman’s do- 
mestic life. Those of us who were privileged in those
-P-A-G-E-165
LATER EDUCATIONAL MEASURES 153 
days to know the interior of the delightful home at 
Wharfeside, understood well in how charming and 
effective a way all that was best in the Arnoldian 
tradition had helped to shape the convictions and to 
control the policy of the Minister of Education. Had 
Arnold lived till 1870, the problem which his son-in- 
law was called upon to solve would have aroused his 
enthusiastic interest; and his guidance and encourage- 
ment would certainly not have been wanting in the 
progress of the Bill. The large tolerance which 
characterized that measure, its sympathy with the 
aspirations of the working classes for enlightenment 
and culture, the political insight which it exhibited, 
and above all the determination of its author to 
enlist on behalf of a system of National Education the 
co-operation of good men of various religious creeds, 
would all have appealed to Arnold’s sympathy. 
There was thus a very real, though at first sight not 
obvious historical connexion between Thomas Arnold 
and the memorable Education Act of 1870. 
A letter which I have received from the Very Rev. 
G. D. Boyle, the Dean of Salisbury, sums up with so 
much truth the impression which Arnold’s life and 
character made upon the generation immediately fol- 
lowing him, that it may be fitting to insert it here: 
“When Dr. Arnold was suddenly taken away from the 
work of his great school, I think it was very soon evident 
from the generous appreciation of his work at Rugby and 
as a professor at Oxford, that he had really outlived the 
many severe judgments of his earlier life, and had fully 
justified the opinion formed of him by the Provost of Oriel,
-P-A-G-E-166
154 THOMAS ARNOLD 
Dr. Hawkins, when he was a candidate for the head-master- 
ship. All who had been at Rugby under him were never 
weary in telling of the impression made by his earnest 
sermons and his lessons in school. But from the mo- 
ment that Dean Stanley’s admirable life appeared, Arnold’s 
influence, hitherto confined to his own pupils, became 
a moving force in English school life. I remember well 
how head-masters and under-masters at the old Charter- 
house exhorted all senior boys to read the story of Arnold’s 
life and aim at some of the great objects so admirably de- 
scribed by Stanley. The late Dean Howson of Chester, who 
had seen Arnold very shortly before his death, told me that 
he thought the contagious enthusiasm of Dr. Arnold’s char- 
acter had been fully represented in Stanley’s Life. The 
unfinished Roman History and the Oxford Lectures had an 
influence of their own. From the time when the rule of 
Arnold was fully recognized, there was a speedy attempt to 
introduce greater variety into the course of school lessons. 
Dr. Moberly told me that he had never known anything 
like the fire that was kindled by Arnold’s educational work. 
Men, who were far from agreeing with many of Arnold’s most 
cherished beliefs, gathered from his example and method 
lessons of the deepest importance. Arnold’s edition of 
Thucydides enabled many, for the first time, to realize the 
true connexion between ancient history and modern political 
life. His generous estimate of Mitford’s G'reece in his Ox- 
ford Lectures, and his hearty delight in Carlyle’s French 
Revolution, made many a reader feel that there ought to be 
no divorce between classical studies and the wide acquaintance 
with modern literature and politics, so often advocated by men 
like the late Professor Freeman and Dean Stanley. When 
I first entered the University of Oxford I found there was 
a disposition on the part of many to undervalue the leading 
characteristics of Rugby men. It may have been true that 
Arnold’s power was sometimes felt too keenly, and that grave 
problems, difficult of solution were, at times, approached by
-P-A-G-E-167
TESTIMONIES TO HIS INFLUENCE 155 
young men who had hardly mastered their importance. But 
when I remember the earnest spirit and love of truth mani- 
fested by men like Walter Shirley, John Conington, Thomas 
Sandars, Henry Smith, Theodore Walrond, and William 
Bright—alas! the only survivor of that remarkable group 
—I seem to realize something of the true Arnoldian of- 
flatus.” 
Here is a somewhat different testimony from an- 
other who knew and loved him. In one of Professor 
Jowett’s letters, he says of Arnold: “His peculiar 
danger was not knowing the world and character, — 
not knowing where his ideas would take other people 
and ought to take himself. Yet, had he been living, 
how we would have nestled under his wings! ””? 
There is a small side chapel in Westminster Abbey, 
the entrance to which is concealed by a huge cliff in 
the shape of a monument to the memory of Craggs, 
Addison’s colleague as Secretary of State. In this 
enclosure the seeker may find a group of memorial 
busts, representing F. D. Maurice, Kingsley, Keble, 
Wordsworth, and Matthew Arnold. And in 1896 a 
marble effigy of Thomas Arnold was placed in this 
congenial company. The ceremony of unveiling was 
simple, and was appropriately performed by Dean 
Bradley, himself a former pupil of Arnold at Rugby. 
More than half a century had passed since Arnold’s 
death, but in that time his fame and influence had 
steadily grown, and on the following day, July 17, 
1896, an accomplished writer in the Times gave 
lLife and Letters of Benjamin Jowett, by E. Abbott and L. 
Campbell.

expression to the national sentiment in words which 
well deserve to be reproduced here. 
“No one made a deeper change in education, a change 
which profited those who had never been at a public school. 
As much as any one who could be named, Arnold helped to 
form the standard of manly worth by which Englishmen 
judge and submit to be judged. A man of action himself, 
he sent out from Rugby men fit to do the work of the 
world. The virtues which his favourite Aristotle extolled — 
courage, justice, and temperance — were his, and the infiu- 
ence of his character and teaching was calculated to make 
brave, high-minded: soldiers, zealous enlightened clergymen, 
lawyers with a just sense of the nature of their vocation, 
and useful and public-spirited members of the State. The 
width and range of his teaching are apt to be forgotten by 
those who dwell on his personal influence. If he offered no 
large interpretation of life, if in his writings there are rarely 
‘thoughts beyond the reaches of the soul,’ if as an his- 
torian he seems more at home in dealing with the geographi- 
cal aspects of his subject, or in clear delineation of the 
movements of events, than in discovering the hidden springs 
of action, if he never or rarely let fall a pregnant unforget- 
table word, he had conceptions, new in his time, first and 
foremost his lofty conception of education, his conception of 
the Church as a great agency of social amelioration, his idea 
of each citizen’s duty to the State, his view of history as a 
whole, with no real division between ancient and modern, 
the interest, new in his time, which he felt in the elevation 
of the masses. One must have been at Rugby or Oxford in 
the thirties to appreciate the effect of Arnold’s sermons on 
generous, susceptible youth. Even in the volume of national 
life as it flows to-day, there may be detected the effect of 
the pure, bracing stream which long ago joined it.”

and insight, as a poet of unquestioned genius, and 
as one who criticised with keenness, but with a deli- 
cate and playful humour all his own, the literature, 
the social life, the religious world, and the political 
events of his day. In all these respects his career 
and influence differed substantially from those of his 
father. During thirty-five years of his life his 
official position was that of an Inspector of Schools, 
and the influence he exerted on public education was 
necessarily large. None hated more heartily than 
he the hybrid word “educationist,” or would sooner 
have disavowed it as a designation for himself; but 
it was as an educationist that a large section of the 
public insisted on regarding him, and it is with his 
share in the history of public instruction, and in the 
formation of public opinion upon it, that we are here 
chiefly concerned.

It was his express wish that he might not be made 
the subject of a biography. That wish has been 
respected by his surviving relatives, and implies an 
equally binding obligation upon all those who knew 
and loved him. But it has not been held by those 
most competent to judge to be a reason for withhold- 
ing the publication of a selection of his letters, 
which form, in fact, an autobiography. The two 
volumes of letters, published in 1895 under the 
skilful and sympathetic editorship of Mr. George 
Russell, cover, in fact, the whole period of Arnold’s 
activity, from 1848 to the end of his life, and disclose 
as fully as any biography could do the main inci- 
dents of his career. From these volumes, from of- 
ficial reports which are publici juris, and from his 
numerous writings, aided in some small degree by 
my personal recollections of a colleague during nearly 
thirty years, it is not difficult to attempt some esti- 
mate of the influence which he exerted on his 
generation. 
He was born in 1822, at Laleham, his father being 
then, as we have already seen, a clergyman without 
a benefice, occupied in preparing young pupils for 
the University. In 1836 he was sent to Winchester, 
the school of which his father always retained grate- 
ful recollections, the head master being Dr. Moberly, 
afterwards Bishop of Salisbury. In the following 
year he was removed to Rugby, where he lived in his 
father’s house. In 1840 he won an open scholarship 
at Balliol, and in 1841 a school exhibition. During 
his residence at Oxford he succeeded in obtaining a
-P-A-G-E-171
  APPOINTMENT AS INSPECTOR 159 
much coveted distinction —the Newdigate prize for 
his poem on Cromwell. One who knew him well, 
and was his constant companion at Oxford, said of 
him in those days: “His perfect self-possession, the 
sallies of his ready wit, the humorous turn which he 
could give to any subject that he handled, his gaiety, 
exuberance, versatility, audacity, and unfailing com- 
mand of words, made him one of the most popular 
and successful undergraduates that Oxford has ever 
known.” He took his degree in the Second Class in 
the Final Classical Schools in 1844, and’ obtained a 
fellowship at Oriel in the following year, just thirty 
years after the election of his father. Among his 
colleagues at Oriel were Dean Church, Dean Burgon, 
Fraser afterwards Bishop of Manchester, Buckle 
afterwards Canon of Wells, Earle afterwards Pro- 
fessor of Anglo-Saxon, and Arthur Hugh Clough. 
_—After leaving Oxford, there was a brief period in 
which he assisted in the classical teaching at Rugby, 
and he was then appointed private secretary to the 
Marquis of Lansdowne,)the Lord President of the 
Council in 1847. In 1851 Lord Lansdowne offered 
him an Inspectorship of Schools under the Privy 
Council, and in the same year he married Frances, 
daughter of Mr. Justice Wightman. This post he 
held up to the year 1886, when he retired from the 
public service.) But on three several occasions, as 
we shall see Pisthes, he was detached from the 
regular duties of the inspectorship for special ser- 
vices, and inquiries into the state of education in 
foreign countries. Of the public duties which he
-P-A-G-E-172
ee ee ee 
160 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
undertook outside that of the Council Office, the 
most important were the Professorship of Poetry at 
Oxford, which he held during two periods of five 
years each, from 1857 to 1867, and the lecturing tour 
he undertook in America in 1883. He did not long 
survive his retirement from the public service, but 
died suddenly on the 15th of April, 1888, a victim to 
an affection of the heart not unlike that which had 
proved fatal to his father and grandfather. 
The two volumes of letters,’ from which these facts 
can be gleaned, have been edited with judicious and 
pious care by Mr. George W. E. Russell. They will 
hardly add much to Arnold’s literary reputation; and, 
interesting as they are, they do not suffice to place him 
in the ranks of the great letter-writers. The pecu- 
liar charm which has in different ways given to the 
epistles of Cicero, of Erasmus, of Pope, of Cowper, 
of Madame de Sévigné, of Chesterfield, of Charles 
Lamb, and of Byron their right to a permanent place 
in epistolary literature, can scarcely be said to be pos- 
sessed by these letters. They were evidently not 
written with even a remote view to their possible 
publication. They deal only incidentally and in a 
small degree with matters of public and historical 
interest, and they do not, to nearly the same extent 
as his father’s, reveal his more matured and serious 
views on great questions. They disclose only the vie 
intime, and are addressed mainly to his mother, his 
wife, sisters, and daughters. Very few of them are

HIS LETTERS 161 
addressed to public men or colleagues. Letters of 
this latter kind doubtless exist, and would have 
added much to the value of the book had the editor 
felt at liberty to use them. But Mr. Russell, whose 
own fine insight, his literary gifts, and his affection- 
ate relations with the writer of the letters would 
have specially qualified him to write a full biography, 
has treated the wishes of his friend as sacred; and 
valuable as are the materials which he has collected, 
they furnish only an inadequate picture of Matthew 
Arnold’s life. Yet that picture is one of singular 
attractiveness. The letters enable the reader to 
trace the successive stages of a career of steadily 
increasing honour and public usefulness. They re- 
veal a tender and home-loving nature, great fortitude 
under disappointment and losses, remarkable intel- 
lectual activity, a keen enjoyment of social life and 
of foreign travel, strong interest in public events, 
and an unaffected delight at the reception with which 
his own writings were welcomed by the reading 
public, and at the influence and fame which they 
brought to him. 
The letters show also how singularly happy he was 
in his domestic relations, how mother, wife, sisters, 
and children were specially gifted with the power to 
evoke what was best in him, and to cheer and ani- 
mate his life; and how the memory of his father, who 
had so early been removed from them, continued to 
hover over the home, to give a sacredness and dignity 
to the whole of the family history, and to ennoble the 
aims of all who were nearly connected with him.

neidentally, also, the letters disclose features of 
is character which would otherwise have been less 
clearly known. His delight in natural scenery, and 
particularly in flowers, his fondness for pet animals, 
the avidity with which in his travels he seized upon 
and appreciated any incidents which threw light on 
the history or social characteristics of foreign peo- 
ples, the patient and thorough study which he de- 
voted to the preparation of any work in which he 
was engaged,— all stand revealed in his letters, and 
are all the more clearly visible because of the naiveté 
of these private utterances, so different in many 
respects from the account he gives of himself in his 
published writings. As one reads “ Arminius,” and 
some of the less serious articles which Arnold wrote, 
one is apt to regard the writer as an amiable trifler, 
who wrote easily, and played lightly with the super- 
ficial aspect of great questions. But the reader of 
his letters will see that every lecture he delivered 
and every article he wrote was a real task to him, 
and was carefully thought out and finished. 
{7 One learns also in his letters from abroad, as in those 
‘of his father, that he seems to be very little attracted 
by what are called the fine arts. He is impressed 
by the Duomo of Florence, and by the splendour and 
historical associations of that beautiful city; but of 
the pictures in the Uffizi and the Pitti Gallery, or 
indeed of any art collection in Europe, he has hardly 
a word to say. Sculpture, painting, and architecture 
do not arouse in him the critical faculty. Nor did 
the modern triumphs of inventiveness and enterprise
-P-A-G-E-175
HIS OFFICIAL WORK 163 
in the application of science affect him much. Every 
man who is good for anything has limitations to his 
tastes and sympathies; and it is interesting to notice 
all'through Arnold’s letters the supreme place which 
letters, philosophy, and history occupied in his ideal 
of human development and culture, and the com- 
paratively low place he assigned to material interests 
and progress. 
Another limitation, less pleasant to dwell upon, 
becomes very manifest as the reader makes the per- 
sonal acquaintance of the writer of these familiar 
and charming letters. He speaks constantly of his 
official work in terms which show that it was dis- 
tasteful to him, and that he regarded it as drudgery; 
eg. “It is a long, tedious business hearing the stu- 
dents give specimen lessons at the Training Schools. 
There is little real utility in it and a great deal of 
claptrap, and that makes the expenditure of time the 
more disagreeable to me. However, I get a good 
many notes written, and odds and ends of things 
done.”! Throughout the letters appear constant 
references to his official work as uncongenial and 
wearisome. It was not a profession he would have 
chosen had he been free to choose. When Lord 
Lansdowne offered him the post, he accepted it, as 
he used frankly to say afterwards, because he wished 
to marry, and because an assured income was neces- 
sary for him. Having, however, been appointed to 
the office, he conscientiously sought to perform its 
1 Letter, Nov. 15, 1870. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
164 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
duties, and at first he expected to find the work more 
interesting than it proved to be. 
“T think,” he said, “I shall get interested in the schbols 
after a little time ; the effects on the children are so immense, 
and their future effects in civilizing the next generation of 
the lower classes who, as things are going, will have most 
of the political power of the country in their hands, may be 
so important. It is really a fine sight in Manchester to see 
the anxiety felt about them, and the time and money the 
heads of the cotton manufacturing population are willing 
to give them. In arithmetic, geography, and history the 
excellence of the schools I have seen is quite wonderful, and 
almost all the children have an equal amount of informa- 
tion ; it is not confined, as in schools of the richer classes, to 
the one or two cleverest boys.” 
As time went on, however, his official work became 
less attractive than he had hoped to find it. In 1854, 
in a letter to his mother, he says: “I more and more 
have the feeling that I do not do my inspecting work 
really well and satisfactorily, but I have also had a 
stronger wish than usual not to vacillate and be help- 
less, but to do my duty, whatever that may be; and 
out of that wish one may always hope to make some- 
thing.” When the proposal was made to him in 
1859 that he should go out as Foreign Commissioner, 
the relief was peculiarly welcome to him. “You 
know,” he writes to his sister, “that I have no 
special interest in the subject of public education, 
but a mission like this appeals even to the general 
interest which every educated man cannot help feel- 
ing in such a subject. I shall for five months get 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
ROUTINE 165 
free from the routine work of it, of which I some- 
times get very sick, and be dealing with its history 
and principles.” * 
Again, in 1862, he writes: “I sometimes grow 
impatient of getting old amidst a press of occupa- 
tions and labour for which, after all, I was not born. 
The work I like is not very compatible with any 
other. But we are not here to have facilities found 
us for doing the work we like, but to make them.” 
‘When superintending the business of making out 
statistical returns in 1871, with a view to setting the 
Education Act in motion, he was supplied with an 
assistant, of whom he says: 
“He has done his work very well and likes all the bustle 
and the business of communicating with school managers, 
and they also like to be communicated with. I like to set 
my man in motion, lay out for him the range of the infor- 
mation I want, suffer him to get it in his own way and at 
whatever length best suits him and the managers, hear his 
story and often decide on the recommendation to be made. 
There are a few points of real difficulty sometimes in mak- 
ing a recommendation, and here I think Iam useful. There 
is no difficulty in all the rest ; others can do it quite as well 
as I can, and I am glad not to spend myself upon it. It is, 
however, what I have generally been spent upon for the last 
twenty years so far as public education is concerned.” ? 
This extract is characteristic, for, while it shows 
his real interest in any question where principle or 
policy was concerned, it also betrays his repugnance

2 Letter, Nov. 28, 1871.
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
to the mere details of official administration. Hear- 
ing the lessons of students of the Training Colleges, 
and estimating their goodness or badness, for exam- 
ple, appeared to him the most wearisome drudgery. 
Here is a playful sketch of his inspectorial work: 
“T must go back to my charming occupation of hearing 
students give lessons. Here is my programme for this after- 
noon: Avalanches, the Steam Engine, the Thames, Indian 
Rubber, Bricks, the Battle of Poictiers, Subtraction, the 
Reindeer, the Gunpowder Plot, the Jordan. Alluring, is 
it not? Twenty minutes each, and the days of one’s life 
are only threescore years and ten !” 
Under all these playful yet half-pathetic grum- 
blings, there was concealed more of real interest in 
the duties of his office than he actually acknowledged. 
And, in truth, it may be doubted if any other labori- 
ous and responsible post in the public service would 
have suited him better. A secretaryship, or any 
office which condemned him to sit for six hours a 
day at a desk, minuting documents and “having the 
honour to be,” would have proved intolerable to him. 
The inspectorship, at least, offered him more freedom, 
more variety, greater power of adjusting his duties to 
his own convenience, and, it must be owned, in his 
case at least, larger leisure for literary pursuits than 
he could have otherwise obtained. Like Charles 
Lamb, John Mill, and Henry Taylor, he chafed 
occasionally under the restraints of official routine. 
But on the whole the public has dealt indulgently 
with those of its servants who have reflected lustre
-P-A-G-E-179
PERSONAL INFLUENCE 167 
on official life by the repute they have gained in the 
world of letters; and Arnold was always ready to 
acknowledge that he had been permitted to bear the 
yoke lightly, and that his colleagues and official 
superiors, who were all proud of him, did their best 
to relieve him from work which he disliked. 
It is needless to say that his visits to managers 
were peculiarly welcome, on personal grounds, and 
that incidentally, though without any show of official 
authority, he often helped them much in showing 
the direction which their own efforts ought to take. 
For example, the Dean of Salisbury, in his inter- 
esting Recollections, speaks warmly of the intense 
refreshment and pleasure he had when Matthew 
Arnold came to inspect a school at Kidderminster. 
“T once,” he adds, “‘heard-a famous preacher at Oxford 
compare a student's first acquaintance with Bengel’s Com- 
mentary to the admission of a ray of light when a shutter 
was opened in a darkened room. The arrival of Matthew 
Arnold at my lodgings was something like this. He brought 
with him a complete atmosphere of culture and poetry. He 
had something to tell of Sainte-Beuve’s last criticism, some 
new book like Lewes’ Life of Goethe to recommend, some 
new political interest to unfold, and, in short, he carried you 
away from the routine of every-day life with his enthusiasm 
and his spirit. He gave me most valuable advice as to the 
training of pupil teachers. ‘Open their minds,’ he would 
say, ‘take them into the world of Shakespeare, and try to 
make them feel that there is no book so full of poetry and 
beauty as the Bible.’ He had something to tell me of 
Stanley and Clough, and it is really difficult to say what a 
delightful tonic effect his visits produced. . . . Qne of his ~

pleasantest characteristics was his perfect readiness to dis- 
cuss with complete command of temper, views and opinions 
of his own which he knew I did not share and thought dan- 
gerous. All who knew him constantly regretted that a man 
of such wonderful gifts should have to spend his life in the 
laborious duties of a School Inspector.” ? 
To Dr. Boyle, as a school manager, naturally 
anxious about the record of “passes” and the amount 
of the government grant, the School Inspector was 
apt to seem a state functionary only, a hardened 
official, condemned to routine and absorbed in the 
mechanical duty of examining young children and in 
filling up schedules and returns. But neither he nor 
any of Arnold’s many admirers, who used to describe 
his work as that of one “cutting blocks with a razor,” 
ever took due heed of the manifold interests with 
which a School Inspector comes in contact, or the 
many opportunities which his office presents of pub- 
lic usefulness and intellectual influence. 
And it must be owned that Arnold himself hardly 
realized the value of such opportunities or the impor- 
tance of the functions which he was called on to 
discharge. Every official post in the world has in 
it possibilities which are not easily visible to the 
outside critic, and which cannot be measured by the 
merely technical requirements laid down by author- 
ity. And this is true in a very special sense of such 
an office as Inspector of Schools, when the holder of 
the office likes and enjoys his work and seeks ampliare

  THE INSPECTOR’S DUTIES 169 
jurisdictionem, and to turn to the most beneficial use 
the means at his command and the authority which 
his office gives. His first duty, of course, is to 
verify the conditions on which public aid is offered 
to schools, and to assure the Department that the 
nation is obtaining a good equivalent for its outlay. 
But this is not the whole. He is called upon to visit 
from day to day schools of very different types, to 
observe carefully the merits and demerits of each, 
to recognize with impartiality very various forms 
of good work, to place himself in sympathy with 
teachers and their difficulties, to convey to each of 
them kindly suggestions as to methods of discipline 
and instruction he has observed elsewhere, and to 
leave behind him at every school he inspects some 
stimulus to improvement, some useful counsel to 
managers, and some encouragement to teachers and 
children to do their best. There are few posts in the 
public service which offer larger scope for the benefi- 
cial exercise of intellectual and moral power, or 
which bring the holder into personal and influential 
relations with a larger number ef people. It will be 
an unfortunate day for the Civil Service if ever the 
time comes when an office of this kind is regarded as 
one of inferior rank, or is thought unworthy of the 
acceptance of men of high scholarship and intel- 
lectual gifts. To hundreds of schools in remote and 
apathetic districts, the annual visit of an experienced 
public officer, conversant with educational work and 
charged with the duty of ascertaining how far the 
ideal formed at headquarters and under the authority 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
170 MATTHEW ARNOLD \ 
of Parliament has been fulfilled, is an event of no 
small importance. And it matters much to the 
civilization of the whole district whether this duty 
is entrusted to pedants and detectives who confine 
their attention to the routine of examination, or to 
men whose own attainments command respect, and 
who are qualified by insight, enthusiasm, and breadth 
of sympathy to advise local authorities, and to form 
a just judgment both of the work of a school and 
of the spirit in which the work is done. He whose 
own thoughts and tastes move habitually on the 
higher plane is the best qualified to see in true per- 
spective the business of the lower plane, and to recog- 
nize the real meaning and value of the humblest 
detail. 
“For most men in a brazen prison live, 
Where in the sun’s hot eye, 
With heads bent o’er their toil, they languidly 
Their lives to some unmeaning task-work give, 
Dreaming of nought beyond their prison wall. 
And as year after year 
Fresh products of their barren labour fall 
From their tired hands, and rest 
Never yet comes more near, 
Gloom settles slowly down over their breast ; 
And while they try to stem 
The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest, 
Death in their prison reaches them 
Unfreed, having seen nothing, still unblest.” * 
This was not an ideal of life which satisfied Arnold. 
But I am unable to agree with those who think his 
1 A Summer Night.
-P-A-G-E-183
  HIS ESTIMATE OF A SCHOOL la 
great gifts were thrown away upon a thankless and 
insignificant office. It is true, he regarded many of 
its duties as mere task-work, and that he reserved 
the best of himself for literary and other employ- 
ments more congenial to him. But it is also true 
that his influence on the schools was in its own way 
far more real and telling than he himself supposed. 
Indirectly, his fine taste, his gracious and kindly 
manner, his honest and generous recognition of any 
new form of excellence which he observed, all tended 
to raise the aims and the tone of the teachers with 
whom he came in contact, and to encourage in them 
self-respect and respect for their work. 
From the official point of view, he was not, it must 
be owned, an exacting Inspector. If he saw little 
children looking good and happy, and under the care 
of a kindly and sympathetic teacher, he would give 
a favourable report, without inquiring too curiously 
into the percentage of scholars who could pass the 
“standard” examination. He valued the elementary 
schools rather as centres of civilization and refining 
influence than as places for enabling the maximum 
number of children to spell and write, and to do a 
given number of sums without a mistake. Hence 
he was never in sympathy with the drastic and 
revolutionary policy recommended by the Duke of 
Neweastle’s Commission in 1861, under which the 
only measure of the efficiency of a school was to be 
the number of “passes” in reading, writing, and 
arithmetic it could contrive to score. This policy 
was afterwards known as “Payment by Results,”
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
and was adopted by Parliament at the instance of 
Mr. Robert Lowe, then Vice-President of the Council, 
who defended the principle with great ability, and 
who embodied it pitilessly and in its most unquali- 
fied form in the celebrated Revised Code of 1862. 
Arnold was willing to admit that the application of 
this rather wooden and statistical test to school work 
really protected a great many of the less promising 
scholars from neglect, and brought up a larger num- 
ber of them than before to a certain level of pro- 
ficiency in the mere rudiments of instruction. But 
he never ceased to complain that the system tended 
to encourage mechanical and unintelligent methods 
of teaching, to leave out of view the best results 
of intellectual discipline and moral training, and 
to lower the conception of teachers in regard to 
the true office and work of a good school. There 
can be no doubt that the Revised Code did much to 
increase his distaste for his official duty and to make 
him feel that he was working under unfavourable 
conditions. It will be seen hereafter that when 
opportunity offered, he showed a frank courage all 
the more creditable to one whose reports were pre- 
sented to his official superiors, and that he pointed 
out with clearness and force the inadequacy of the 
system and its impoverishing effect on the instruc- 
tion. 
His valued assistant, Mr. Thomas Healing, who 
wrought with him among the Westminster Schools 
for several years, thus describes his methods of 
work:
-P-A-G-E-185
  MR. HEALING’S TESTIMONY 173 
“T was struck by his perfect frankness and candour in all 
his educational relationships. He never pretended to be an 
oracle in methods of instruction, and therefore never attempted 
to prescribe to teachers the precise methods they should use, 
though he would often kindly criticise a teacher’s mode of 
handling a subject if it lacked simplicity or breadth of treat- 
ment. For example, the multiplication of mere topographical 
details in geography, neglect to arrange facts in illustration 
of great general principles, or wandering among points of 
little practical value in grammar, while the main facts and 
rules bearing upon the construction of sentences were over- 
looked. Such errors in method always drew from him an 
adverse judgment, because he was particularly open to admire 
logical arrangement, clearness, the marshalling of matter in 
view of a definite end. But even in such cases he rarely 
suggested the method that should be adopted. He claimed 
“free play for the Inspector” and accorded the same to the 
teacher, being always ready to acknowledge and praise origi- 
nality of treatment, and to allow him full liberty to give 
any twn to the instruction for which his special tastes and 
acquirements qualified him. 
“Neither did he pose as a specialist in the matter of 
school-fittings and architecture. Some of his judgments on 
these topics, as contained in his reports (e.g. the use and 
abuse of galleries, the Old British tripartite system), are most 
reasonable and sound; but they are rather the opinions of 
an educated outsider, speaking from the facts brought under 
his notice, than of the specialist. He knew and highly 
esteemed those of his colleagues, who, in these technical 
matters, could speak with authority. 
“Tn the Elementary Schools he did much to improve the 
reading books. He complained of many of them as filled 
‘with the writing of second or third rate authors, feeble, 
incorrect, and colourless,’ or ‘with dry scientific disquisi- 
tions, which are the worst possible instruments for teaching
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 ‘ MATTHEW ARNOLD 
to read, and which spoil the scholar’s taste when they are 
nearly his only means for forming it.’ I happen to know 
of cases in which books were recast, owing to’ his influence, 
and their matter substantially improved. 
“Mr. Arnold frequently drew attention to the want of 
culture in the case of both pupil teachers and Training-College 
students, as evidenced by their inability to paraphrase a plain 
passage of prose or poetry, without totally misapprehending 
it, or falling into gross blunders of taste and expression. He 
states his opinion that the study of portions of the best 
English authors and composition might with advantage be 
made a part of their regular course of instruction to a greater 
degree than prevailed at the time. His anxiety that the 
children should feel the refining influence of letters led him, 
as the best means to attain that end, to promote the higher 
education of teachers, and especially to direct them to the 
study of literature. He inspired many a young teacher with 
the desire to work in the direction of obtaining a London 
degree, and even those who did not succeed were permanently 
benefited by the efforts they made. If he found a young 
man of promise in a school, he generally had with him some 
serious and sympathetic talk on this subject ; and some have 
told me in the after years that they would never have 
attempted a work of such difficulty but for the stimulus 
applied by Mr. Arnold. In the same direction was his 
advocacy of the teaching of French and Latin to the more 
advanced scholars. He thought the study of an inflected 
language would prove helpful in studying grammatical prin- 
ciples, and that Latin would give an insight into the mean- 
ing of many English words, and help to widen the vocabulary. 
His advice in the matter of languages was not taken to any 
large extent, though something was done; and Mr. Arnold 
gave an annual prize to be competed for by the pupil teach- 
ers of his district in elementary French. 
“ His ideal of excellence was high. His own eminence in 
literature, and his earnest belief in the power of letters, as
-P-A-G-E-187
ee ae 
HIS METHOD OF INSPECTION 175 i 
interpreted by himself, to humanize and elevate men and to 
make them reasonable, led him to take the steps I have indi- 
cated for teachers and scholars to come under its influence. 
In a school, he looked for indications of the operation of this 
power, as shown in the performance of recitation with due 
intelligence and expression and, if possible, with feeling ; in 
grammar when marked by accurate thinking and correct 
application of rules; and in composition by appropriate use 
of words. He expected that orderly thinking and the habit 
of stating things clearly should be shown in other subjects of 
instruction, valuing these excellences far above mechanical 
accuracy or stores of crude information. Though endowed 
with deficient musical faculty, he appreciated tasteful singing, 
and highly estimated its refining influence. 
“Tn striving to arrive at a just estimate of the state of the 
instruction in a school, he would often examine in elementary 
subjects the Second Standard, as giving some measure of the 
accuracy of the spelling and arithmetic; and then the read- 
ing, recitation, and grammar of the upper division, thus gaug- 
ing the extent to which anything approaching culture had 
penetrated. His usefulness as an Inspector, appears to me, 
lay very much in his success in bringing some tincture of 
letters into the curriculum of the Elementary School. 
“ As an eminent critic and man of letters, possessing a great 
knowledge of the state of education at home in its broader 
aspects through a most extensive acquaintance with writers, 
and with the clergy, the scholastic and legal professions, and 
a similar familiarity with continental education through his 
employment on European educational commissions, he brought 
to the study of all educational problems an enlightened judg- 
ment and a power of comparison possible to very few. Con- 
sequently, his views and conclusions were such as would in 
most cases command the assent of the great public of cult- 
ured men — of the University and literary class he knew so 
well.”

Marruew ARNoxtp’s position as an officer of the 
Education Department was exceptional and, in some 
respects, unique. When he was first appointed, there 
was a concordat between the Council Office and the 
various religious bodies, in virtue of which none but 
clergymen were charged with the duty of inspecting 
Church of England schools. In like manner Roman 
Catholic inspectors were charged with the inspection of 
Catholic schools. His own duty, therefore, as a lay In- 
spector, was to visit the schools connected with the 
British and Foreign School Society, Wesleyan, and 
other Protestant schools not connected with the Church 
of England. As these schools were far less numerous 
than others, the district assigned to him at first was 
very large, comprising nearly one-third of England, 
After the Education Act of 1870, the system of 
denominational inspection was necessarily, and very 
properly, abandoned; districts became smaller, and 
176
-P-A-G-E-189
  HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES 177 
the official Inspector was required to visit all the 
schools which received Government aid in the area 
assigned to him. From this time his official work 
became less laborious, and was practically limited to 
one of the easiest divisions of the metropolis, — the 
borough of Westminster, —a district so well provided 
with voluntary denominational schools that for a 
long time there was in it only one school provided 
by the London School Board. 
~~—~As a Chief Inspector he had the nominal super- 
vision of his colleagues in the southeastern Division; 
but the plans which were adopted under the Vice- 
Presidency of Mr. Mundella, in 1882, for making 
this supervision effective, and for co-ordinating and 
harmonizing the work of the District Inspectors by 
means of visitation and by conferences with their chief, 
hardly came to maturity during Arnold’s term of 
office, and practically his opportunities for inter- 
course with his colleagues were not numerous. He 
was never actually a member of the well-known Code 
Committee; for, as it has been said, the details of 
administration, the framing of syllabuses and sched- 
ules, and the laying down of the legal conditions 
under which the public grant should be assessed and 
distributed, were tasks not to his mind. But when 
questions of principle were involved, he was fre- 
quently consulted, and we who were his colleagues 
received from him at times very weighty and prac- 
tical suggestions. I remember well the discussion 
when the question arose, “Should the teaching of 
English be a compulsory subject, or should it re- 
N  
-P-A-G-E-190
178 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
main optional, say between geography or elementary 
science?” On that point he was emphatic. Every- 
thing else taught in an elementary school might, he 
said, be made a matter of memory or routine, but 
good exercises in the vernacular language, and in the 
meaning, formation, and right use of words, repre- 
sented the one kind of knowledge in which “cram” 
was impossible, and which must, if acquired at all, 
be gained by an effort of thought. He regarded any 
system of popular education incomplete which did 
not provide for instruction in the right use of the 
mother-tongue, as a condition precedent to the acqui- 
sition of all else. He dreaded overloading the 
curriculum of the elementary school with too numer- 
ous or pretentious subjects; and was well content to 
limit the number of optional subjects which might 
be selected by a teacher from a list containing geog- 
raphy, history, and various branches of science. But 
some insight into the grammar and literature of the 
English language was in his view indispensable, and 
should, in the higher classes at least, be invariably 
insisted on. 
But the chief means at his disposal for impressing 
these and other views on elementary education upon 
the Department, teachers, and managers, and upon 
the public generally, were his annual reports, which 
were widely read by persons who seldom cared to 
consult Blue Books. From 1852 to 1882 these Re- 
ports, interrupted only by his occasional employment 
on foreign service, illuminated the official records of 
the Committee of Council on Education and attracted
-P-A-G-E-191
  HIS ANNUAL REPORTS 179 
much public attention. Much of what he said dealt 
necessarily with statistics, with changes in the Code, 
and with matters of ephemeral controversy. But 
he availed himself of the opportunity which these 
reports offered to state with some fulness his own 
views on many subjects of abiding interest, and he 
has thus contributed to render the future aims of our 
primary-school system clearer, and to make the work 
of his successors easier. 
For example, he formed from the first a just con- 
ception of the duty of the Inspector in respect to the 
frank and fearless exposure of faults. Very early in 
his official life, he says: 
“An Inspector’s first duty is that of a simple and faithful 
reporter to your Lordships ; the knowledge that imperfections 
in a school have been occasioned, wholly or in part, by peculiar 
local difficulties, may very properly restrain him from recom- 
mending the refusal of grants to that school, but it ought 
not to restrain him from recording the imperfections. It 
is for your Lordships to decide how far such imperfections 
shall subsequently be made public ; but that they should be 
plainly stated to you by the Inspector whom you employ, 
there can be, I think, no doubt at all... . 
“A certain system may exist, and your Lordships may 
offer assistance to schools established under it ; but you have 
not surely, on that account, committed yourselves to a faith 
in its perfect excellence ; you have not pledged yourselves to 
its ultimate success. The business of your Inspector is not 
to make out a case for that system, but to report on the con- 
dition of public education as it evolves itself under it, and to 
supply your Lordships and the nation at large with data for 
determining how far the system is successful. If, for fear of 
discouraging voluntary effort, Inspectors are silent respecting  
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
the deficiencies of schools, respecting the feeble support given 
to one school, the imperfect accommodations in another, the 
faulty discipline or instruction in a third, and the failure of 
all alike to embrace the poorest class of children, —if every- 
thing is represented as hopeful and prosperous, lest a mana- 
ger should be disappointed or a subscriber estranged, — then 
a delusion is prolonged in the public mind as to the real 
character of the present state of things, a delusion which it 
is the very object of a system of public inspection exercised 
by agents of the Government on behalf of the country at 
large to dispel and remove. . . . 
“Tt is an ungrateful task to seem to deprecate, under any 
circumstances, consideration and indulgence. But consid- 
eration and indulgence, the virtues of the private man, may 
easily become the vices of the public servant.” ? 
Lest, however, the teachers should think his criti- 
cisms implied harshness or want of sympathy, he 
added: 
“No one feels more than I do how laborious is their work, 
how trying at times to the health and spirits, how full of 
difficulty even for the best ; how much fuller for those, whom 
I too often see attempting the work of a schoolmaster, men 
of weak health and studious habits, who betake themselves 
to this profession as affording the means to continue their 
favourite pursuits. . . . Still, the quantity of work actually 
done at present by teachers is immense; the sincerity and 
devotedness of much of it is even affecting ; they themselves 
will be the greatest gainers by a system of reporting which 
clearly states what they do, and what they fail to do, not 
one which drowns alike success and failure, the able and the 
inefficient, in a common flood of vague approbation.” 
His conception of the Inspector’s duty caused him, 
as we have already said, to view with extreme dis- 
1 Report to the Committee of Council, 1854.
-P-A-G-E-193
INSPECTION AND EXAMINATION 181 
favour that change in the character of school examina- 
tions which was a necessary sequel to the Revised 
Code. He thought that the adoption of a lower and 
less intelligent standard of excellence in the schools 
implied and rendered necessary a lowering of the 
Inspector’s office; and he thus contrasted the older 
system, which estimated the work of a school by 
inspection, with the newer system of formal indi- 
vidual examination. 
“Inspection under the old system meant something like 
the following: The Inspector took a school class by class. 
He seldom heard each child in a class read, but he called out 
a certain number to read, picked at random, as specimens of 
the rest; and when this was done he questioned the class 
with freedom, and in his own way, on the subjects of their 
instruction. As you got near the top of a good school, these 
subjects became more numerous; they embraced English 
grammar, geography, and history, for each of which the 
Inspector’s report contained a special entry, and the exami- 
nation then often acquired much variety and interest. The 
whole life and power of a class, the fitness of its composition, 
its handling by the teacher, were well tested; the Inspector 
became well acquainted with them, and was enabled to make 
his remarks on them to the head teacher, and a powerful 
means of correcting, improving, and stimulating them was 
thus given... . 
“The new examination groups the children by its stand- 
ards, not by their classes ; and however much we may strive 
to make the standards correspond with the classes, we can- 
not make them correspond at all exactly. The examiner, 
therefore, does not take the children in their own. classes. 
The life and power of each class, as a whole, the fitness of 
its composition, its handling by the teacher, he therefore does 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
    182 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
not test. He hears every child in the groups before him 
read, and so far his examination is more complete than the 
old inspection. But he does not question them; he does 
not, as an examiner under the rule of the six standards, go 
beyond the three matters, — reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
—and the amount of these three matters which the standards 
themselves prescribe. Indeed, the entries for grammar, geog- 
raphy, and history have now altogether disappeared from the 
forms of report furnished to the Inspector. The nearer, 
therefore, he gets to the top of the school, the more does his 
examination in itself become an inadequate means of testing 
the real attainments and intellectual life of the scholars 
before him. Boys who have mastered vulgar fractions 
and decimals, who know something of physical science and 
geometry, a good deal of English grammar, of geography, and 
history, he hears read a paragraph, he sees write a paragraph, 
and work a couple of easy sums in the compound rules or 
practice. As a stimulus to the intellectual life of the school 
—and the intellectual life of a school is the intellectual life 
of its higher classes — this is as inefficient as if Dr. Temple, 
when he goes to inspect his fifth form at Rugby, were just 
to hear each boy construe a sentence of delectus, conjugate 
one Latin verb, and decline two Greek substantives. . . . 
The whole school felt, under the old system, that the prime 
aim and object of the Inspector’s visit was, after insuring the 
fulfilment of certain sanitary and disciplinary conditions, to 
test and quicken the intellectual life of the school. The 
scholars’ thoughts were directed to this object, the teachers’ 
thoughts were directed to it, the Inspectors’ thoughts were 
directed to it. . . . The new examination is in itself a less 
exhausting business than the old inspection to the person 
conducting it, and it does not make a call as that did upon 
his spirit and inventiveness ; but it takes up much more time, 
it throws upon him a mass of minute detail, and severely 
tasks hand and eye to avoid mistakes.” *

FORMATIVE STUDIES 183 
Arnold always insisted on the necessity of including 
in the course of even the elementary school some 
ingredients which, though they might have no visible 
and immediate bearing on the industrial career of the 
pupil, were what he called “formative.” “Sewing, 
calculating, writing, spelling,” he said, “are neces- 
sary; they have utility, but they are not formative. 
To have the power of reading is not in itself for- 
mative.” Hence he urged the importance of better 
reading-books. He admitted that for the mere attain- 
ment of the mechanical art of reading, the common 
reading-book, with its promiscuous variety of con- 
tents, was well enough. But as literature, as means 
of forming the taste and judgment of the pupil, 
they were contemptible. He had a special horror 
of that “somewhat terrible character, the scientific 
educator,” who wanted to make school reading-books 
the vehicles for imparting stores of scientific, geo- 
graphical, and other information. “Good poetry, 
however,” he said, “is formative; it has, too, the 
precious power of acting by itself and in a way 
suggested by nature.” Hence he always urged the 
importance of learning choice extracts of poetry. 
Learning by heart is often called disparagingly 
learning by rote, and is treated as an old-fash- 
ioned, unintelligent exercise and a waste of time. 
But he attached great value to this exercise. 
“T believe that even the rhythm and diction of good 
poetry are capable of exercising some formative effect, even 
though the sense be imperfectly understood. But of course 
the good of poetry is not really got unless the sense of the
-P-A-G-E-196
184 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
words is thoroughly learnt and known. Thus we are reme- 
dying what I have noticed as the signal mental defect of 
our school children —their almost incredible scantiness of 
vocabulary.” + 
Even this counsel of perfection was capable, as he 
afterwards found, of being interpreted in an unsat- 
isfactory way. Fragments of long poems, such as 
Scott’s Lady of the Lake, and other narratives, were 
often selected, and as these fragments had no unity 
of their own, and were learned by those who had 
never read the poems as a whole, the acquisition 
appeared to him to be very worthless. The ex- 
perience of one of our colleagues, who reported 
that on asking the children of an upper class, 
“Who Shakespeare was,” he received for answer that 
he was a writer of the time of Elizabeth and the 
author of two works, Hubert and Arthur and the 
Trial Scene at Venice, illustrates well the mischievous 
effect of the common practice in dealing with frag- 
ments of great literary masterpieces. He always 
urged that scholars who offered to recite one or two 
hundred lines should be made to show that they 
knew something about the contents of the poem of 
which the extract formed a part, and should at least 
have read it through as a whole, and seen the rela- 
tion in which that extract stood to the rest. He 
then lays down the conditions which should be ob- 
served in the selection of passages for the memoriter 
exercise. 
1 Report for 1878,

  GRAMMAR IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 185 
“That the poetry chosen should have real beauties of 
expression and feeling, that these beauties should be such 
as the children’s hearts and minds can lay hold of, and that 
a distinct point or centre of beauty and interest should occur 
within the limits of the passage learne| — all these are con- 
ditions to be insisted on. Some of the short pieces by Mrs. 
Hemans, such as The Graves of a Houselold, The Homes of 
England, The Better Land, are to be recommended because 
they fulfil all three conditions; they have real merits of 
expression and sentiment; the merits are such as the chil- 
dren can feel, and the centre of interest, these pieces being 
so short, necessarily occurs within the limits of what is 
learnt. On the other hand, in extracts taken from Scott or 
Shakespeare, the point of interest is not often reached 
within the hundred lines which is all that children in the 
Fourth Standard learn.” ? 
Of the claims of grammar to be included, even in 
an elementary school course, he says: 
“T attach great importance to grammar, as leading the 
children to reflect and reason, as a very simple sort of logic, 
more effective than arithmetic as a logical training, because 
it operates with concretes or words instead of with abstracts 
or figures. ... Parsing is the very best portion of the 
discipline of grammar, and it is not too hard for Fourth 
Standard children if it is taught judiciously. The analytic 
character of our language enables a teacher to bring its 
grammar more easily within a child’s reach; and advantage 
should be taken of this analytic character, instead of teaching 
English grammar, as was the old plan, with a machinery 
borrowed from the grammar of synthetic languages. I am 
glad to observe that in the instruction of pupil teachers, the 
analytic method of parsing is coming into use more and 
more... . 
1 Report for 1880,
-P-A-G-E-198
186 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
“T have never been able to understand the contempt with 
which what is even now effected in grammar in our schools 
is regarded. The grammar required for the lower standards 
is spoken of as quite ridiculously insufficient. Yet, is it so 
insignificant a mental exercise to distinguish between the 
use of shelter in these two phrases, ‘to shelter under an 
umbrella,’ and ‘to take shelter under an umbrella’? I do 
not think so; and this is the sort of elementary logic which 
the grammar for the Second Standard demands, which the 
children attain to, and which does them, in my opinion, a 
great deal of good.” ? 
i It is the belief of some modern writers that Latin and 
French are subjects of secondary and higher instruc- 
tion only, and that any attempt to include them in the 
primary course is an encroachment on the proper prov- 
ince of the intermediate or higher school. That was 
not Arnold’s opinion. He thought that the rudiments 
of one of those languages, at least, might with advan- 
tage be taught to the more advanced scholars even in 
the elementary school, as a preparation for the right 
use of any further educational opportunities they might 
enjoy after leaving that school. And even if no such 
opportunity occurred, he deemed it essential that the 
scholar should at least be made aware that there were 
other languages than his own, and should find what 
Bacon calls an “entrance” into one of them. 
“Every one is agreed as to the exceptional position of 
Latin among the languages for our study. Our school-boy 
of thirteen will do little with his rudiments of Latin unless 
he carries on his education beyond the scope of our ele- 
mentary schools and their programmes. But, if he does 
carry it on beyond that scope, Latin is almost a necessity

IE 
for him. By allowing Latin as a special subject for a cer- 
tain number of scholars in our elementary schools, we are 
but recognizing that necessity, and recognizing, as surely we 
very properly may, that for some of the better scholars in 
our schools the necessity will arise. French, too, has a 
special claim. ‘To know the rudiments of French has a com- 
mercial value. A boy who is possessed of them has an 
advantage in getting a place. He knows this himself, and 
his parents know it; a little French in addition to good 
attainments in reading, writing, and arithmetic, is a recom- 
mendation for a place. A little Latin is not, a little Ger- 
man is not, a little botany is not ; a little French is. Here 
is a reason for admitting French to our list of extra subjects, 
closely limited though this list ought to be. French has 
the educational value for our school children of being a 
second language; it has also an educational value for us 
from its precision and lucidity — qualities in which the ex- 
pression of us English people is often deficient ; and it is, 
besides, a matter of instruction which has the advantage of 
much commending itself to the minds of our scholars them- 
selves and of their parents as a help to a boy’s start in life.” 
-—Although Arnold thought the demands made for 
more of science teaching in schools were being unduly 
pressed, he recognized the need of such teaching 
within certain limits. He thought that the inclusion 
of mathematics, animal physiology, physical geog- 
raphy, and botany in the list of optional specific sub- 
jects for the primary school was a mistake. But 
what the Germans called Naturkunde, and Professor 
Huxley called Physiography,—an elementary know- 
ledge of the facts and laws of nature,— appeared to 
him a necessary ingredient in the primary-school 
course. For children of thirteen, he thought it pre- J ~

mature to enter upon the technicalities of specific 
sciences. 
“The excuse for putting most of these matters into our 
programme is that we are all coming to be agreed that an 
entire ignorance of the system of nature is as gross a defect 
in our children’s education as not to know that there ever 
was such a person as Charles the First... . We ought 
surely to provide that some knowledge of the system of 
nature should form part of the regular class course. Some 
fragments of such knowledge do in practice form part of the 
class course at present. Children in learning geography are 
taught something about the form and motion of the earth, 
about the causes of night and day, and the seasons. But 
why are they taught nothing of the causes, for instance, of 
rain and dew, which are, at least, as easy to explain to them, 
and not less interesting? And this is what the teaching of 
Naturkunde, or natural philosophy (to use the formerly 
received, somewhat over-ambitious English name for the 
same thing), should aim at; it should aim at systematiz- 
ing for the use of our schools a body of simple instruction in 
the facts and laws of nature, so as to omit nothing which is 
requisite, and to give all in right proportion. Of course the 
best agency for effecting this would be a gifted teacher ; but 
as gifted teachers are rare, what we have most to wish for 
is the guidance of a good text-book. Such a text-book does 
not at present, so far as I know, exist ; some man of science, 
who is also a master of clear and orderly exposition, should 
do us the benefit of providing one. But, meanwhile, there is 
no reason for delaying the attempt to teach in a systematic 
way an elementary knowledge of nature. Text-books abound 
from which a teacher may obtain in separate portions what he 
requires ; there can be no better discipline for him than to 
combine out of what he finds in them the kind of whole 
suited to the simple requirements of his classes. Some 
teachers will do this a great deal better than others, but all 
 
-P-A-G-E-201

will gain something by attempting it; and their classes, 
too, however imperfectly it is at first often effected, will 
gain by its being attempted.”* 
What his view was about the degree of formative 
influence which was to be expected from the study of 
physical science, apart from general mental cultiva- 
tion in the humanities, may be well illustrated by 
the playful comments which occurred to him once 
when fresh from the perusal of a number of examingg 
tion papers which had been set to candidates for the 
office of teacher, and had included inter alia some 
questions on the play of Macbeth. 
“At last year’s meeting of the British Association, the 
President of the Section for Mechanical Science told his 
hearers that in such communities as ours, the spread of 
natural science is of far more immediate urgency than any 
other secondary study. ‘ Whatever else he may know, viewed 
in the light of modern necessities, a man who is not fairly 
versed in exact science is only a half-educated man, and 
if he has substituted literature and history for natural 
science, he has chosen the less useful alternative.’ And 
more and more pressure there will be, especially in the 
instruction of the children of the working classes, whose 
time for schooling is short, to substitute natural science for 
literature and history as the more useful alternative. And 
what a curious state of things it would be if every scholar 
who had passed through the course of our primary schools 
knew that when a taper burns, the wax is converted into 
carbonic acid and water, and thought, at the same time that 
a good paraphrase of Canst thou not minister to a mind 
diseased? was, Can you not wait upon the lunatic? The 
1 Report for 1878.
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
problem to be solved is a great deal more complicated than 
many of the friends of natural science suppose. They see 
clearly enough, for instance, how the working classes are, in 
their ignorance, constantly violating the laws of health, and 
suffering accordingly ; and they look to a spread of sound 
natural science as the remedy. What they do not see is 
that to know the laws of health ever so exactly, as a mere 
piece of positive knowledge, will carry a man, in general, no 
great way. To have the power of using, which is the thing 
wished, these data of natural science a man must, in gen- 
eral, have first been in some measure moralized; and for 
moralizing him it will be found not easy, I think, to dis- 
pense with those old agents — letters, poetry, religion. So let 
not our teachers be led to imagine, whatever they may hear 
and see of the call for natural science, that their literary 
cultivation is unimportant. The fruitful use of natural 
science itself depends, in a very great degree, on having 
effected in the whole man, by means of letters, a rise in 
what the political economists call the standard of life.” * 
Thus it is because the study of material facts and 
laws does not necessarily carry the student into any 
region beyond that study itself, and because the 
humaner studies can shed a light on everything else 
which is to become a subject of investigation and 
thought, that Arnold always insisted on the superi- 
ority of the latter studies to the former, as instruments 
for the formation of character and the regulation of 
life. 
It is observable that for the fulfilment of his own 
ideal, and for stimulating fresher and healthier intel- 
ligence in place of routine and mechanism, he was not 
1 Report for 1878.

HIS DISTRUST OF PEDAGOGIC RULES 191 
disposed to rely much on the scientific study of the 
theory of education. Books on pedagogy bored him, 
and he had a suspicion that when relied on too much, 
they were apt to beget a formalism of their own. 
“How,” he asks, “is a sensible teacher likely to effect 
most practical good? Is it by betaking himself to the : 
scientific teachers of pedagogy, by feeding on generalities, 
by learning that we are to ‘disuse rule-teaching, and adopt 
teaching by principles,’ that we are to teach things ‘in the 
concrete instead of in the abstract,’ that we are to walk 
worthy of the doctrine long ago enunciated by Pestalozzi, 
that ‘alike in its order and its methods education must 
conform to the natural process of mental evolution’? 
“The worst of such doctrines is that everything depends 
upon the practical application given to them, and it seems 
so easy to give a practical application which is erroneous. 
The doctrine of Pestalozzi, for instance, may be excellent, and 
none can say that it has not found ardent friends to accept 
it and employ it; and the result is that one sees a teacher 
holding up an apple to a gallery of little children, and say- 
ing, ‘An apple has a stalk, peel, pulp, core, pips, gnd juice ; 
it is odorous and opaque,and is used for yee leasant -— 
drink called cider.” In virtue~of like theories few methods™ 
of spelling, new methods of learning to read, new methods 
of learning arithmetic are called for. Some of them are 
ingenious. We must always remember, however, that their 
apparent conformity to some general doctrine, apparently 
true, is no guarantee of their soundness. The practical 
application alone tests this, and often and often a method ‘yd 
thus tested reveals unsuspected weakness. Then there is, 
besides the difficulty of getting new methods which are & 
unfamiliar substituted for old methods which are familiar.”   And in summing up the aims and scope of the 
elementary school of the future, he says:
-P-A-G-E-204
os 192 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
“The best thing for a teacher to do is surely to put before 
himself, in the utmost simplicity, the problem he has to 
solve. He has to instruct children between the ages of four 
and thirteen ; children, too, who have for the most part a 
singularly narrow range of words and thoughts. He has, so 
far as secular instruction goes, to give to those children the 
power of reading, of writing, and (according to the good old 
phrase) of casting accounts. He has to give them some 
knowledge of the world in which they find themselves, and 
of what happens and has happened in it; some knowledge, 
that is, of the great facts and laws of nature, some know- 
ledge of geography and of history, above all, of the history of 
their own country. He has to do as much towards opening 
their mind, and opening their soul and imagination, as is 
possible to be done with a number of children of their age, 
and in their state of preparation and home surroundings.” * 
That this last duty of opening the soul and the 
imagination could not be performed by mere hirelings 
and pedants,’ but needed to be entrusted to persons 
who regarded their own “personal cultivation as one of 
the chief duties of their office, was a constant theme 
on which he insisted, in conversations with teachers 
as well as in official reports: “The teacher will open! 
the children’s soul and imagination the better, the 
more he has opened his own; so he will also clear 
heir understanding. the better, the more he has 
cleared his own.” /With this principle in view, 
Arnold never lost an opportunity of urging on the 
younger teachers the need of more thought and liter- 
ary culture than are represented by the possession of 
a Government diploma, and nothing pleased him

  THE TEACHER’S PERSONAL CULTIVATION 193 
better than to give special encouragement and sym- 
pathy to those teachers in his district who, after 
obtaining their legal certificate, intended to graduate 
at the London University, or were otherwise making 
efforts after self-improvement. 
“Tt is among the teachers that the desire for a better cult- 
ure, and the attainment of it, most shows itself. It shows 
itself in those in my district by more and more numerous 
efforts to pass the examinations which the London University, 
with a wise liberality, makes accessible to so large and various 
a class of candidates. I gladly seize every opportunity to ex- 
press the satisfaction which the sight of these efforts gives me. 
To the able, the ardent, and the aspiring among the young 
teachers of schools under my inspection, I say: ‘Your true way 
of advancing yourselves, of raising your position, of keeping 
yourselves alive and alert amidst your trying labours, is there.’ 
And the more the Government certificate comes to be regarded 
as a mere indispensable guarantee of competency, not as a 
literary distinction, the better ; literary distinction should be 
sought for from other and larger sources. ... The rate 
of general intelligence in schools and pupil teachers depends 
mainly, of course, upon the rate of general intelligence in the 
head-teachers. This will depend upon their continuing and 
extending the cultivation with which they have started. In 
no way can they so well do this as by working for a definite 
object, which will give them matters of study definite and, 
on the whole, well chosen. The schoolmasters of my dis- 
trict know how I have always encouraged them to try the 
matriculation examination at the London University.’. . . 
I believe that the languages now required for matriculation 
are Latin and French, with a third language, which may be 
either German or Greek. Latin, French, and German are 
an_excellent, and_by no means over-difficult, study for our 
young schoolmasters, and the rest of the examination will

present nothing but what is comparatively easy to them. It 
is my strong hope that it will soon become the rule for every 
young schoolmaster in my district to matriculate at the Lon- 
don University.” 
Ce regard to religious instruction, Matthew Arnold 
e sired to apply to the elementary school principles 
of action very nearly akin to those which his father 
had exemplified at Rugby and had advocated’ in 
regard to popular literature. He knew well that the 
best religious influences are not those which are 
produced by the compulsory enforcement of theologi- 
cal dogmas upon young children. Hence he had no 
sympathy with those of the clergy and the support- 
ers of denominational schools who think all religious 
training impossible without the teaching of creeds and 
catechisms, and the enforcement of the distinctive ten- 
ets of their respective sects in the common schools. 
Yet he attached high value, on intellectual as well as 
on moral and. religt 3 5 to the teaching of the 
of religious controversy, and the rivalries of hostile 
sects, made it necessary for the authors of the Edu- 
cation Act to exclude the subject of religious in- 
struction from the purview of the official inspectors 
altogether. He thought that in this way there was 
grave danger lest the Biblical teaching might suffer 
neglect. 
“Let the school managers,” he said, “make the main out- 
lines of Bible history, and the getting by heart a selection of 
the finest Psalms, the most interesting passages from the his- 
torical and prophetical books of the Old Testament, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
    
UNSECTARIAN RELIGIOUS TEACHING 195 
chief parables, discourses, and exhortations of the New, a 
part of the regular school work, to be submitted to inspec- 
tion and to be seen in its strength or weakness like any 
other. This could raise no jealousies; or, if it still raises 
some, let a sacrifice be made for them for the sake of the 
end in view. Some will say that what we propose is but a 
small use to put the Bible to; yet it is that on which all 
higher use of the Bible is to be built, and its adoption is the 
only chance for saving the one elevating and inspiring element 
in the scanty instruction of our primary schools from being 
sacrificed to a politico-religious difficulty. There was no 
Greek school in which Homer was not read ; cannot our popu- 
lar schools, with their narrow range and their jejune alimen-, 
tation in secular literature, do as much for the Bible as the 
Greek schools did for Homer?” ? 
With a view to illustrate his own conception of he 
purpose which the study of the Bible might serve, 
merely as an instrument of intellectual culture, Arnold 
wrote, in 1872, a little book which he called a Bible 
reading for schools. It consisted of the last twenty- 
seven chapters of Isaiah, and was annotated and 
explained under the title of The Great Prophecy of 
Israel’s Restoration. In the preface he says:   
“Why is this attempt made? It is made because of my 
conviction of the immense importance in education of what 
is called letters ; of the side which engages our feelings and 
imagination. Science, the side which engages our faculty 
of exact knowledge, may have been too much neglected ; 
more particularly this may have been so as regards our 
knowledge of nature. This is probably true of our second- 
ary schools and Universities. But on our schools for the 
people (by this good German name let us call them, to mark 
1 Report for 1869. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
the overwhelmingly preponderant share which falls to them 
in the work of national education) the power of letters has 
hardly been brought to bear at all; certainly it has not been 
brought to bear in excess, as compared with the power of the 
natural sciences. And now, perhaps, it is less likely than 
ever to be brought to bear. The natural sciences are in high 
favour ; it is felt that they have been unduly neglected, they 
have gifted and brilliant men for their advocates, schools for 
the people offer some special facilities for introducing them ; 
on the other hand, the Bible, which would naturally be the 
great vehicle for conveying the power of letters into these 
schools, is withdrawn from the list of matters with which 
Government inspection concerns itself, and, so far, from 
attention.” ? 
And he proceeds to show that from the nature of 
the subject good text-books are more common and 
more possible in science than in literature, and that 
in classical schools the literary interest is cultivated 
by Greek and Roman learning, while in elementary 
schools there was nothing analogous to it. 
“Only one literature there is, one great literature for which 
the people have had a preparation — the literature of the 
Bible. However far they may be from having a complete 
preparation for it, they have some ; and it is the only great 
literature for which they have any. Their bringing up, what 
they have heard and talked of ever since they were born, 
have given them no sort of conversance with the forms, 
fashions, notions, wordings, allusions of literature having 
its source in Greece and Rome; but they have given them 
a good deal of conversance with the forms, fashions, notions, 
wordings, allusions of the Bible. Zion and Babylon are 
their Athens and Rome, their Ida and Olympus are Tabor

-P-A-G-E-209
THE BIBLE IN THE SCHOOL 197 
and Hermon, Sharon is their Tempe; these and the like 
Bible names can reach their imagination, kindle trains of 
thought and remembrance in them. The elements with 
which the literature of Greece and Rome conjures, have no 
power on them; the elements with which the literature of 
the Bible conjures, have. Therefore I have so often insisted, 
in reports to the Education Department, on the need, if 
from this point of view only, for the Bible in schools for the 
people. If poetry, philosophy, and eloquence, if what we 
call in one word Jetters, are a power and a beneficent wonder- 
working power in education, through the Bible only have the 
people much chance of getting at poetry, philosophy, and 
eloquence. Perhaps I may here quote what I have at former 
times said: ‘Chords of power are touched by this instruction 
which no other part of the instruction in a popular school 
reaches, and chords various, not the single religious chord 
only.’ The Bible is for the child in an elementary school 
almost his only contact with poetry and philosophy. What 
a course of eloquence and poetry (to call it by that name 
alone) is the Bible in a school which has, and can have, but 
little eloquence and poetry ! and how much do our elementary 
schools lose by not having any such course as part of their 
school programme! All who value the Bible may rest assured 
that thus to know and possess the Bible, is the most certain 
way to extend the power and efficacy of the Bible.” * 
In further vindication of his choice of the final 
chapters of the book of Isaiah as an exercise for 
school reading, he goes on to say: “To make a great 
work pass into the popular mind is not easy, but our 
series of chapters have one quality which facilitates 
this passage for them — their boundless exhilaration. 
Much good poetry is profoundly melancholy; now the 
1 Bible Reading for Schools, p. 10.

  198 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
life of the people is such that in literature they 
require joy. If ever that ‘good time coming’ for 
which they long, was presented with energy and mag- 
nificence, it is in these chapters. It is impossible to 
read them without catching its glow.”? 
In a private letter to me about this little book, he 
says, “It is the educational side of the question that 
I particularly care for. It does not much matter 
whether or no one thing more or less is produced 
which in literature is happy and brilliant, there is 
so much of this in literature already; but whether 
the people get hold of a single thing in high litera- 
ture, this point of education is of immense matter.” 
Arnold was not sanguine in reference to the effect 
of his effort to produce a reading-book for schools, 
and indeed its reception was very cold, and I have 
never heard of a school in which the book was used. 
There is something pathetic, however, in his evident 
consciousness that the effort would fail, and yet in 
his faith that his effort would bear fruit in the future. 
“For any one who believes in the civilizing power of letters, 
and often talks of this belief, to think that he has for more 
than twenty years got his living by inspecting schools for the 
people, has gone in and out among them, has scen that the 
power of letters never reaches them at all, and that the whole 
study of letters is thereby discredited, and its power called in 
question, and yet has attempted nothing to remedy this state 
of things, cannot but be vexing and disquieting. He may 
truly say, like the Israel of the prophet, ‘We have not 
wrought any deliverance in the earth!’ and he may well 
desire to do something to pay his debt to popular education

    UNFULFILLED HOPES 199 
before he finally departs, and to serve it, if he can, in that 
point where its need is sorest, where he has always said its 
need was sorest, and where, nevertheless, it is as sore still as 
when he began saying this twenty years ago. Even if what 
he does cannot be of service at once, owing to special preju- 
dices and difficulties, yet these prejudices and difficulties 
years are almost sure to dissipate, and the work may be of 
service hereafter.” ? 
Whether or not Arnold succeeded in fulfilling the 
official ideal of a Government Inspector is a question 
hardly worth discussing. But he who undertakes his 
work in the spirit shown in the extracts here made, 
and has left behind him influence so calculated to 
ennoble the primary-school teacher, his work, and 
his aspirations, will ever be entitled to a high place 
in the annals of the Education Department, as well 
as in the world of letters.

Or will be seen from Matthew Arnold’s letters 
passim, how much he enjoyed occasional opportuni- 
ties of employment in foreign countries. Three such 
opportunities came to him in the course of his official 
life, and were especially welcome to him, partly be- 
cause he was enabled by them to escape from what 
seemed to him monotonous and wearisome in his 
regular official duties, and mainly because inquiries 
into foreign systems, and their relation to the polity 
and needs and national character of the several coun- 
tries in which those systems were operative, were 
especially congenial to him. The first of his spe- 
cial reports was in 1861, to the Commission which 
was presided over by the Duke of Newcastle, and 
which had been charged, in 1859, with the duty of 
inquiring into the state of popular education in 
England. The Minutes of Council of 1845 had been 
in full operation for twelve years when the Commis- 
200 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  
FOREIGN COMMISSIONS " god 
sion was appointed, and the Government and the 
nation desired to know what was the actual working 
of the measure, and whether or not the State was 
receiving an adequate return for the increasing grants 
which were made from the Treasury. The Commis- 
sioners, however, wisely resolved that their inquiry 
should not be restricted to our own country, and that 
it would help them much to learn by way of com- 
parison what had been done in other lands which had 
enjoyed a larger experience than our own of State 
action. Accordingly, Arnold was instructed as For- 
eign Assistant Commissioner to inquire and report in 
reference to the state of popular education in France, 
Holland, and Switzerland. 
The second occasion on which he was detached from 
his ordinary work for special foreign service was in 
1865, when the Schools Inquiry Commission, under 
the chairmanship of Lord Taunton, was charged with 
the duty of reporting on secondary education in Eng- 
land and Wales. Arnold again accepted the office of 
Assistant Commissioner, and was instructed to report 
on the systems of education of the middle and upper 
classes in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. 
For the third time he received, in November, 1885, 
“a summons to make a foreign journey. On this occa- 
sion it was the Education Department itself which 
gave him instructions. In view of contemplated 
legislation, the heads of that department desired to 
receive more detailed information from Germany, 
Switzerland, and France, on four specific points, 
which were thus indicated: Free education; the  
-P-A-G-E-214
202 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
quality of education; the status, training, and pen- 
sioning of teachers; and compulsory attendance and 
release from school. 
Of these three reports, the first and second, after 
due publication in the Blue Books, were afterwards 
reprinted as separate books, the first under the title of 
The Popular Education of France, with Notices of that 
of Holland and Switzerland; and the second under the 
title of Schools and Universities on the Continent. The 
third appeared only as a parliamentary paper in 1886. 
Many of the statistical and other details of these 
reports are of temporary interest only, and much of 
the organization which he describes has by this time 
been modified or superseded. Hence the narrative 
which these reports furnish — picturesque and sug- 
gestive as it is — has now little more than an historical 
value. But the experience he gained in these memo- 
rable visits led him to consider wider questions than 
those which concerned the administration of educa- 
tional bureaus, the work of schools, and the suc- 
cess of their methods. For example, when his first 
report was reprinted in 1861, in a volume no longer 
bearing the official stamp, he felt free to prefix to 
it an essay on the true functions of the State in a 
democratic community. Asa contribution to political 
philosophy, and as a key to many of his later specula- 
tions on public questions, this essay will probably 
rank as one of his best and most thoughtful utter- 
ances. He had been profoundly impressed by reading 
De Tocqueville, and had learned from that acute 
thinker to estimate the advantages, and at the same
-P-A-G-E-215
  DEMOCRACY 203 
time to perceive some of the perils, of a democratic 
society, particularly as they were exemplified in the 
United States and in France. De Tocqueville had 
urged that democracy was inevitable, and, on the 
whole, desirable, but desirable only under certain 
conditions, those conditions capable of being realized 
by care and foresight, but capable also of being 
missed. Hence the great desideratum was to seek 
out and devise that form of democracy, which on the 
one hand most exercises and cultivates the intelli- 
gence and mental activity of the majority, and on the 
other breaks the headlong impulse of popular opinion 
by delay, rigour of forms, and adverse discussion. 
“The organization and establishment of democracy 
on these principles is,” as John Stuart Mill has justly 
said, “the great political problem of our time.” ? 
Arnold concluded from his observation and study 
that forces were at work which made it impossible 
for the aristocracy of England to conduct and wield 
the English nation much longer. It is true that they 
still have in their hands a large share in the admin- 
istration, and, as Mirabeau said, “Administrer, c’est 
gouverner; gouverner c'est regner; tout se reduit la.” 
But in Arnold’s view this headship and leadership of 
one class, with the substantial acquiescence of the 
body of the nation in its predominance and right to 
lead, were nearly over. There was nothing to lament 
in this. The fuller development of national life, the 
reduction of the signal inequalities that characterize 
the older societies, and the extension to all classes

-P-A-G-E-216
  204 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
of a due sense of individual responsibility and of 
corporate existence were, in his view, more than 
compensation for the loss of a certain stateliness 
and force which belonged to an aristocratic régime. 
“The power of France in Europe is at this day mainly 
owing to the completenesss with which she has 
organized democratic institutions. The action of the 
French State is excessive, but it is too little under- 
stood in England that the French people has adopted 
this action for its own purposes, has in great measure 
attained those purposes by it, and owes to having 
done so the chief part of its influence in Europe. 
The growing power in Europe is democracy, and 
France has organized demoer y with a certain indis- 
putable grandeur and success.” Arnold’s first official 
visit to the Continent left on him a strong impression 
of the weakness which comes from our insular dread 
of State action. He recognized the value of voluntary 
effort and local initiative in English institutions; but 
he thought we overestimated these things, and that 
we had much to-learn from the organized State sys- 
tems of foreign lands, especially that of France. 
From the first, France interested him more than 
Germany. Notwithstanding our nearer affinity in 
race to the Teutonic people, he thought the English 
community much more closely akin to the French in 
their history and genius, their love of liberty, their 
literature, their national aspirations, and their moral 
ideals. The Germans he was wont to speak of as a 
“disciplinable and much disciplined people,” who 
had, it is true, received valuable institutions from
-P-A-G-E-217
  FRANCE AND GERMANY 205 
the ruling classes, but who had shown in their his- 
tory less spontaneity of national life, and had under- 
gone fewer of the experiences likely to be specially 
exemplary to Englishmen than our nearest neigh- 
bours, the French. Like Heine, that Paladin of the 
modern spirit, he gave the preference to France 
rather than to Germany, because “the French as a 
people have shown more accessibility to ideas, be- 
cause prescription and routine have had less hold 
upon them than upon any other people, and because 
they have shown more readiness to move and to 
alter at the bidding (real or supposed) of reason. 
“Englishmen and Frenchmen have alike the same 
instinctive sense rebelling against what is verbose, 
ponderous, roundabout, inane, in one word niais or 
silly, in German literature.1 In his report, Arnold 
says further, that the “Prussian people, under its 
elaborate system of education, have become a studious 
people, a docile people, a well-informed people if you 
will, but also a somewhat pedantic and somewhat 
sophisticated people.” ? 
Hence there was much, he thought, to be gained 
if the men of France and England, though diverse 
in race, yet morally akin, would observe and under- 
stand one another better. Of the Englishman and the 
Frenchman he said: “Neither is likely to have the 
other’s faults, each may safely adopt as much as suits 
him of the other’s qualities. If I were a Frenchman, 
I should never be weary of admiring the independent

local habits of action in England, of directing atten- 
tion to the evils occasioned in France by the excessive 
action of the State; for I should be very sure that, 
say what I might, the part of the State would never 
be too small in France, nor that of the individual too 
large. Being an Englishman, I see nothing but good 
in freely recognizing the coherence, rationality, and 
efficaciousness which characterize the strong State 
action of France, of acknowledging the want of 
method, reason, and result which attend the feeble 
State action of England; because I am very sure that, 
strengthen in England the action of the State as 
one may, it will always find itself sufficiently con- 
trolled.” Tracing the habitual jealousy with which 
the Englishman is wont to regard Government action 
to the long struggle for religious and political liberty 
against a dominant aristocratic and ecclesiastical 
class, Arnold warned his countrymen that, though 
this jealousy was justifiable once, it was so no longer. 
“Tt is not State action in itself which the middle 
and lower classes of a nation ought to deprecate, it is 
State action exercised by a hostile class, and for their 
oppression. From a State action reasonably, equita- 
bly, and rationally exercised, they may derive great 
benefit, greater by the very nature and necessity of | 
things than can be derived from this source by the | 
|   class above them. For the middle and lower classes 
to obstruct such action is to play the game of their 
enemies, and to prolong for themselves a condition of 
real inferiority.” +

COMPETITION FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE 207 ( 
After describing the College of France and the 
numerous State establishments which exist in Paris 
under the general sanction of the Minister of Public 
Instruction, to wit, the Schools of living Oriental 
Languages, the Bureau des Longitudes, the Polytechnic 
Military School, the Naval School of Hydrography, 
the schools of Woodcraft and Agriculture, of Com- 
merce and of Mines, and the Academy of Medicine, 
he says: 
“Public establishments such as these serve a twofold 
purpose. They fix a standard of serious preparation and 
special fitness for every branch of employment —a standard 
which acts on the whole intellectual habit of the country. 
| To fix a standard of preparation is a very different thing, 
and it is a far more real homage to intelligence and study 
than to demand —as we have done since the scandal of our 
old mode of appointment to public functions grew too evi- 
dent —a single examination by a single Board, with a stafi 
of examiners as the sole preliminary to all kinds of civil 
employment. Examinations preceded by preparation in a 
first-rate superior school give you a formed man; examina- 
tions preceded by preparation under a crammer give you a 
crammed man, but not a formed one... . A second pur- 
pose which such public establishments serve is this: They ; 
represent the State, the country, the collective community in 
a striking, visible shape, which is at the same time a noble 
and civilizing one, giving the people something to be proud 
of and which it does them good to be proud of. The State 
is, in England, singularly without means of civilization of 
this kind. But a modern State cannot afford to do without 
them, and the action of individuals and corporations cannot 
fully compensate for them; the want of them has told 
severely on the intelligence and refinement of our middle and 
lower classes. . .. What the State, the collective, per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
208 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
manent nation honours, the people honour; what the State 
neglects, they think of no great consequence.” ? 
This view of the true function of the State is 
further summarized in another passage which I 
transcribe from A French Eton: 
“Ts a citizen’s relation to the State that of a dependent 
to a parental benefactor? By no means; it is that of a 
member in a partnership to the whole firm. The citizens 
of a State, the members of a society, are really a partner- 
ship—‘a partnership, as Burke nobly says, ‘in all sei- 
ence, in all art, in every virtue, in all perfection.’ 
Towards this great final design of their connexion, they 
apply the aids which co-operative association can give them.” 
In this rather unpopular belief, and in the light of 
these general principles, Arnold made his foreign 
inquiries; and his reports may be described as a 
sustained argument in favour of this thesis, that once 
secure an enlightened democracy, a community ani- 
mated by a progressive spirit and noble ideals, it is 
the part of wisdom to invoke the collective power of 
the State to give effect to those ideals. 
It is from the point of view thus indicated that 
Arnold’s first report is most suggestive. He describes 
in full the organization of the primary schools, both 
in their relation to the provincial academies and to 
the central government, the salaries and status of the 
teachers, and the course of normal training through 
which they pass. He is especially careful to do full 
justice to the “congreganist” schools, which are

  RELATION OF FRENCH SCHOOLS TO THE STATE 209 
maintained by religious bodies, and while conform- 
ing to certain well-understood conditions respecting 
the condition of the premises and the qualifications 
of the teachers, received little aid from the State. 
Under the administration of Guizot in 1835 an 
attempt had been made by the State to co-operate 
with the churches, and to secure that religious 
instruction should be given in the common schools. 
Three only of the numerous religious divisions with 
which we are familiar were recognized by the State, 
—the Roman Catholic, the Protestant, and the Jew- 
ish. In those communes where more than one of the 
forms of worship thus recognized is publicly pro- 
fessed, each form was to have a separate school. 
But the Departmental Council had the power to 
authorize the union in a common school of children 
belonging to different denominations. Of children 
thus united, however, the religious liberty was sedu- 
lously guarded. It was provided that ministers of 
each communion should have free and equal access to 
the school at separate times in order to watch over 
the religious instruction of members of their own 
flock. Arnold, in 1860, found this system working, 
and spoke favourably of its results. But he had his 
misgivings about its permanence. “The French 
system,” he said, “recognized certain religious divi- 
sions in the population, but it does not divide itself 
in order to meet them. It maintains its own unity, 
its own impartiality. In their relations with the 
State, with the Civil Power, all denominations have

to meet upon a common ground. The State does not 
make itself denominational; the denominations have 
to make themselves national.” It is mainly because 
the denominations have failed to make themselves 
national by co-operating with the State on conditions 
which the State could accept, that in later years all 
attempts at compromise and co-operation have been 
abandoned, and France has taken refuge in the abso- 
lutely secular system which now prevails. 
The history of this failure to secure a ground of 
common action between the churches and the civil 
power in France, as it may be traced in Arnold’s vol- 
ume, is not without a deep and special significance for 
English readers in our own day. To Americans, it is 
less instructive, for in the United States the delimita- 
tion of duty and responsibility between the churches 
and the State has been from the first more clearly 
marked; and the secularization of the common school 
has met with the national approval, not only because 
it is the only system on which a State system has been 
found possible, but because it gives to the churches a 
stronger sense of their own special responsibility, 
and is not believed to be inimical to the true interests 
of religion. 
6- “In the interval between the first and the second of 
his foreign missions, he published, at first in the 
form of a magazine article, and afterwards in that 
of a little book, the essay under the title of A French 
Eton. It consisted of a description of two French 
institutions which had specially interested him, 
though they lay outside the purview of his first com-
-P-A-G-E-223
    THE LYCEE OF TOULOUSE 211 
mission. One of these was the Lyceum or public 
secondary school at Toulouse, considered as a type 
of a class of school to which there is nothing analo- 
gous in England. It is attached to a local acad- 
emy of the first rank, and is founded and maintained 
by the State with aid from the Department and 
the Commune, and under the general control of the 
Minister of Public Instruction in Paris. All the 
professors had gone through the excellent normal 
school course, and were duly licensed. There were 
between three and four hundred students and a 
separate preparatory institution, le Petit Collége, for 
boys from six to twelve years of age. The pro- 
gramme of studies included Latin and Greek grammar 
and the French language, the ancient and the ver- 
nacular languages being pursued pari passu from the 
first: e.g. Phedrus and La Fontaine, Lucian and 
Télémaque; in the next class Virgil and Xenophon, 
with Voltaire’s Charles XII., then Sallust and Cicero, 
with Massillon and Boileau; afterwards the Greek 
tragedians, Plato and Demosthenes, with Bossuet 
and Montesquieu, while in the sixth or highest form 
there was a division into two courses, rhetoric and 
philosophy, to correspond to the direction, literary 
or scientific, which the studies of the more advanced 
scholars were to take. The fees are regulated by 
public authority; for tuition only, from 110 francs to 
180 francs a year, and for boarding and instruction, 
from 800 francs to 900 francs. 
“Such may be the cheapness of public-school education, 
when that education is treated as a matter of public economy

  212 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
to be administered on a great scale with rigid system and 
exact superintendence in the interests of the pupil and not 
in the interest of the school keeper. Such a Lyceum is not 
managed for speculation or profit, for the public is the real 
proprietor of the Lyceums which it has founded for the edu- 
cation of its youth and for that object only; the directors 
of the Lyceum are simple servants of the public employed 
by the public at fixed salaries.” 
Another school at Soréze, a village in the depart- 
ment of the Tarn-et-Garonne, attracted his attention 
as one of the most successful private schools in France, 
under the direction of the celebrated Dominican father, 
Lacordaire. The French Government acknowledges 
the obligation to allow liberty of teaching, but not 
liberty to incompetence. Hence, even in private reli- 
gious enterprises of this kind, the director was bound 
to hold a certificate of probation and a certificate of 
competency; but for the rest, the Soréze institution 
was one in which the venerable director was free to 
exercise his own religious influence and to try his 
own experiments. The programme of studies differed 
little from that of a Lyceum, although Lacordaire 
deprecated the more pronounced military system of 
the State schools. But what impressed Arnold most 
was the generous and high-toned educational aim of 
the school and the fact that, at a charge a little more 
than that exacted in the Lycées, there were to be found 
in France, under the supervision of responsible public 
bodies, or of the State itself, middle-class institutions 
of a type not to be met with at home, and he asked:
-P-A-G-E-225
  
  CONTINENTAL SYSTEMS a F 
“Why cannot we have throughout England as the French 
have throughout France, as the Germans have throughout 
Germany, as the Swiss have throughout Switzerland, and 
as the Dutch have throughout Holland, schools where the 
middle and professional classes may obtain at the rate of 
from £20 to £50 a year if they are boarders, and from 
£5 to £15 a year if they are day scholars, an education of 
as good quality, with as good guarantees of social charac- 
ter and advantages for a future career in the world, as the 
education which French children of the corresponding class 
can obtain from institutions like that of Toulouse or 
Soréze ?” 
_-—~Arnold did not argue that either of these institu- 
tions exactly corresponded to Eton, or could do for Eng- 
lish boys all that Eton does. The great public schools 
of this country had formed the ruling class, and the 
ruling class had been, mainly through this influence, 
imbued on the whole with a high, magnanimous, 
governing spirit. Those institutions had their origin 
in ancient endowments. But beautiful and remarka- 
ble as are many of the aspects under which our system 
presents itself, this form of public establishment of 
education with its limitations, its preferences, its ec- 
clesiastical character, its inflexibility, its inevitable 
want of foresight, had proved, as time rolled on, to be 
subject to many inconveniences and to many abuses. 
He thought that for the class frequenting Eton, the 
children of luxury, the grand aim should be not to 
increase the comforts which would make the school 
more like their own well-equipped homes; but to give 
them those good things which their birth and rearing 
are least likely to give them, to give them (besides  
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
book learning) the notion of a sort of republican fel- 
lowship, the practice of a plain life in common, the 
habit of self-help. To the middle class the grand aim 
of education should be to give largeness of soul and 
personal dignity; and to the lower class — feeling, 
gentleness, humanity. 
The details collected by Arnold from Holland, 
Belgium, and Switzerland cannot be summarized 
here. But it is interesting to observe that, much as 
these countries differed in circumstances, and in the 
idiosyncrasies of their people, they all served to con- 
firm his general preference, if not for purely State 
action in regard to public education, at least for some 
guidance and sense of responsibility on the part of 
the State, in dealing with individual and local 
initiative. 
“T do not think we can hope in England for municipali- 
ties which, like the Dutch municipalities, can in the main 
safely be trusted to provide and watch over schools, for 
a population which, like the Dutch population, can in the 
main safely be trusted to come to school regularly, or for a 
government which has only to give good advice and good 
suggestions in order to be promptly obeyed. Even the Gov- 
ernment of Holland, however, has regulated popular educa- 
tion by law; even the school-loving people of Holland, so 
well taught, so sober minded, so reasonable, is not aban- 
doned in the matter of its education to its own caprices. 
The State in Holland, where education is prized by the 
masses, no more leaves education to itself than the State in 
France, where it is little valued by them. It is the same 
in the other country of which I have described the school 
system —in Switzerland, Here and there we may have 
found, indeed, school-rules in some respects injudicious, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  FRENCH LAW RESPECTING ENDOWMENTS 2156 
some respects extravagant; but everywhere we have found 
law, everywhere State-regulation.” ? 
His report to the Schools Inquiry Commission of 
1867 is chiefly interesting because it contains an 
account of the organization of secondary instruction 
in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. In each 
country the institutions and the public laws are of 
much later date than our own, and are less influenced 
by mediaeval traditions. For example, the report 
explains the fundamental difference between the law 
of inheritance, as it prevails in France, and the com- 
mon law of England, which allows a testator to name 
trustees with perpetual succession, and to prescribe 
for all future time the manner in which the usufruct 
of his estate shall be employed. “These endowments 
are of far less importance in France than in England. 
In the first place, the Revolution made a clean sweep 
of all old endowments which date from an earlier 
time. In the second place, the French law sets 
limits to a man’s power of disposing of his property, 
while in England such limits do not exist. In 
France, by the Code Napoléon (Art. 913, and the 
articles following), if a man leaves one legitimate 
child, he may dispose of one-half of his property, 
and no more, away from him; if he leaves two, he 
may dispose of one-third, and no more; if he leaves 
more than two, of one-fourth, and no more. If he 
has no children, a certain proportion of his property 
is similarly secured to his nearest representatives 
within certain limits. The amount of property free 
1 Popular Education in France, pp. 233, 234,
-P-A-G-E-228
216 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
to be disposed of in benefactions is thus much smaller 
in France than in England. 
“Tn England a man names an individual to be trustee, or 
a number of individuals to be trustees, to carry into effect a 
charitable request, on conditions assigned by him at pleasure. 
In France this cannot be done. A founder must entrust his 
bequest for charitable purposes to a personne civile, defined 
as an étre fictif auquel la loi reconnait une partie des droits 
qui appartiennent aux personnes ordinaires, et qui peuvent 
recevoir des liberalités. Such a personne civile must be 
either a public establishment (for instance, a public hospital, 
a parish church, a commune) or an establishment of public 
utility.” + 
Curious information is given in this report respect- 
ing the fluctuations of opinion, during a long succes- 
sion of Ministers of Public Instruction, in reference to 
the place which the study of ancient languages should 
hold in liberal education. But, on the whole, Greek _ 
and Latin had retained their traditional supremacy. 
A passage from a letter addressed to Professor Coning- 
ton from Paris indicates a substantial difference of 
ideal between English and French teachers. 
“Piles of exercise-books are sent to me to look through, 
and I wish you could see them with me. The Latin verse 
is certainly very good, but it is clear that Latin and Greek 
are cultivated almost entirely with a view to giving the 
pupil a mastery over his own language —a mastery which 
has always been the great object of intellectual ambition 
here and which counts for more than a like mastery does 
with us. Perhaps, because it does not count for so much

-P-A-G-E-229
  
  COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS 
  with us, a like mastery is, in fact, scarcely ever attained in 
England, certainly never at school.”? 
Gt will be seen that Arnold’s attention in these for- 
eign inquiries was more directed to matters of organi- 
zation, and to the economical and political aspects 
of the educational problem, than to the details of 
pedagogic method. Nevertheless, incidentally and 
occasionally, he dealt with some topics having a 
special bearing on the interior work of schools and 
on matters of policy, on which the minds of teachers 
are not yet wholly made up. Among these we can 
only refer to two, of which one is the well-worn topic 
of entrance scholarships by competition. 
“The French dycées, however, are guiltless of one pre- 
posterous violation of the laws of life and health committed 
by our own great schools, which have of late years thrown 
open to competitive examinations all the places on their 
foundations. The French have plenty of examinations, but 
they put them almost entirely at the right age for examina- 
tions — between the years of fifteen and twenty-five when the 
candidate is neither too old or too young to be examined 
with advantage. To put upon little boys of nine or ten the 
pressure of a competitive examination for an object of the 
greatest value to their parents, is to offer a premium for 
the violation of nature’s elementary laws, and to sacrifice, as 
in the poor geese fatted for Strasburg pies, the due develop- 
ment of all the organs 6f life to the premature hypertrophy 
of one. It is well known that the cramming of the little 
human victims for their ordeal of competition tends more 
and more to become an industry with a certain class of small 
schoolmasters who know the secrets of the process, and who

218 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
are led by self-interest to select in the first instance their 
own children for it. The foundations are no gainers, and 
nervous exhaustion at fifteen is the price which many a 
clever boy pays for over-stimulation at ten ; and the nervous * 
exhaustion of a number of our clever boys tends to a broad 
reign of intellectual deadness in the mass of youths from 
fifteen to twenty whom the clever boys, had they been 
rightly developed and not unnaturally forced, ought to have 
leavened. You can hardly put too great a pressure on a 
healthy youth to make him work between fifteen and twenty- 
five ; healthy or unhealthy you can hardly put too light a 
pressure of this kind before twelve.” ! 
On another topic, that of leaving examinations 
abiturienten examen, the experience furnished by Ger- 
many seemed to Arnold especially valuable. He 
discusses the use which was made of such an exami- 
nation by the State as a qualification for the public 
service. The course followed with the Realschulen and 
with the higher Burgher Schools is thus described: 
“For entrance to the different branches of the public ser- 
vice, the leaving certificate of the classical school had, up to 
1832, been required. For certain of these branches it was 
determined, in 1832, to accept henceforth the certificate of 
the Realschule or the higher Burgher School instead of that 
of the gymnasium. Different departments made their own 
stipulations: the Minister of Public Works, for instance, 
stipulated that the certificate of the candidate for the Bau- 
akademie (School of Architecture) should be valid only when 
the candidate’s Realschule or higher Burgher School had been 
one of the first class, or with the full number of six classes, 
and when he had passed two years in each of the two highest 
classes. I mention a detail of this kind to show the com-

  EDUCATION IN CITIZENSHIP 219 
missioners how entirely it is the boy’s school and training 
which the Prussian Government thinks the great matter, 
and not his examination.” 
Finally there is appended to the report a copy of 
the programme on Législation Usuelle in the then newly 
organized Enseignement Secondaire Spécial in France, 
which, as it relates to a department of a citizen’s train- 
ing scarcely yet recognized by English teachers, is 
specially suggestive to them. Of this programme he 
says: 
“The programme headed législation usuelle, giving the 
outline of a course on the public and private law, and the 
administrative organization of France, —how the govern- 
ment is composed, what are the functions of its different 
departments, how the municipalities are constituted, how 
the army is recruited, how taxes are raised, what is the 
legal and judicial system of the country, how in the most 
important relations of civil life, marriage inheritance, hold- 
ing property, buying, selling, lending, borrowing, partner- 
ship, the laws affect the citizen, — this programme in 
particular seems to me so well composed, both for what it 
inserts and what it omits, and so suggestive, that I reprint 
it at the end of this report for the Commissioners’ informa- 
tion. The programmes on the legislation of commerce and 
industry, and on rural, industrial and commercial economy, 
are also very interesting ; but each of these is more particu- 
larly designed for a single division of pupils, according to 
the class of profession to which they are destined ; whereas 
the programme for législation usuelle is designed for all, 
containing what it is important for all alike to know; there- 
fore it is not so easy a programme to prepare, and has a 
more general interest when prepared.”

Marruew Axrnorp never lost an opportunity of 
exposing with pitiless candour the fallacy of the 
belief so fondly cherished by the British Philistine, 
that we are a well-educated people, and that we are 
likely to remain so, if we give free play to local initi- 
ative and private enterprise. On the contrary, he 
brought forward, as we have seen, an immense mass 
of facts, personal experiences, and statistics to prove 
that whereas in Continental countries, in which the 
education of the middle class is a matter of national 
concern and State supervision, “that class in general 
may be said to be brought up upon the first plane, in 
England it is brought up on the second plane,” and 
he quotes with sorrowful acquiescence the language 
of a foreign reporter who said, “ L’ Angleterre propre- 
ment dite est le pays d’Hurope ow Vinstruction est le 
moins répandue.”* Arnold regarded it as one of the 
chief aims of his life to disturb our insular self-

  CLASSIFICATION OF ENGLISH SOCIETY 221 
gratulation, and to make English people profoundly 
discontented with their present provision for inter- 
mediate and higher instruction. 
He was fond of dividing English society into three 
classes, —the upper or aristocratic and official class, 
the middle class, and the working or lower class. The 
first he playfully characterized as the Barbarians, the 
second as the Philistines, and the third as the Popu- 
lace. Of the first of these classes, he always speaks 
with good-humoured tolerance and with a certain 
qualified admiration. 
“Tt is the chief virtue of a healthy and uncorrupted aris- 
tocracy that it is in general im the grand style. That eleva- 
tion of character, that noble way of thinking and behaving 
which is an eminent gift of nature to some individuals, is 
also often generated in whole classes of men (at least when 
these come of a strong and good race) by the possession of 
power, by the importance and responsibility of high station, 
by habitual dealing with great things, by being placed above 
the necessity of struggling for little things. It may go along 
with a not very quick or open intelligence, but it cannot 
well go along with a conduct vulgar and ignoble,”? 
But on the other hand, in the same essay he dwells 
emphatically on the incapacity of the ruling class for 
ideas, and traces to this cause the secret of their 
declining influence and their want of success in 
modern epochs. 
“They can, and often do, impart a high spirit, a fine 
ideal of grandeur, to the people ; thus they lay the founda- 
tions of a great nation. But they leave the people still the

  222 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
multitude, the crowd ; they have small belief in the power 
of the ideas which are its life. . . . In one most important 
part of general human culture — openness to ideas and ardour 
for them — aristocracy is less advanced than democracy, and 
to keep the latter under the tutelage of the former would on 
the whole be actually unfavourable to the progress of the 
world. At epochs when new ideas are powerfully permeat- 
ing in a society, and profoundly changing its spirit, aristocra- 
cies, as they are in general not long suffered to guide it without 
question, so are they by nature not fitted to guide it intelli- 
gently.” ! 
And he quotes with approval from his favourite, 
De Tocqueville, the remark “that the common people 
is more uncivilized in aristocratic countries than in 
others, because there the lowly and the poor feel 
themselves, as it were, overwhelmed with the weight 
of their own inferiority.” ? 
It is not easy to understand the true nature of 
Arnold’s influence on public education without con- 
sidering the estimate he formed of the society in 
which he lived, and the rather merciless view he took 
of some of our national foibles and weaknesses. In 
a spirit which reminds us from time to time of Ape- 
mantus, of Jacques, of Swift, or of Carlyle, he poses 
throughout many of his prose writings as the critic 
and censurer of mankind. He once said of Goethe: 
“He took the suffering human race, 
He read each wound, each weakness clear, 
And struck his finger on the place 
And said, ‘ Thou azlest, here and here /’”

THE PHILISTINES 223 
In a sense it is true of Arnold that he set himself 
the like task, and that on the whole he fulfilled it 
with sureness of touch, with insight and skill, with 
a pleasant mingling of raillery and persuasiveness, 
though not with unqualified success. As he looked 
upon English society, he thought he saw an upper 
class materialized and frivolous, a middle class vul- 
garized, and a lower class brutalized. 
But while he recognized some compensation for 
the lack of ideas in the tone of manners and in the 
public services of the aristocracy, and some corrective 
for the peculiar vices of democracy in its openness 
of mind and accessibility to ideas, he reserved for the . 
middle class his severest criticism and his most hu- 2 
morous invective. He called them Philistines. He = 
said of this class, that although with virtues of its 
own it was “full of narrowness, full of prejudices, 
with a defective type of religion, a narrow range of 
intellect and knowledge, a stunted sense of beauty, a 
low standard of manners, and averse, moreover, to 
whatever may disturb it in its vulgarity.” ? 
“The great English middle class, the kernel of the 
nation, the class whose intelligent sympathy had 
upheld a Shakespeare, entered the prison of Puritan- 
ism and had the key turned upon its spirit there for 
two hundred years. ‘He enlargeth a nation,’ said 
Job, ‘and straiteneth it again.’ If the lower classes 
in this country have utterly abandoned the dogmas of @, ‘ 
Christianity, and the upper classes its practice, the 0. oF 
cause lies very much in the impossible and unlovely

presentment of Christian dogmas and practice which 
is offered by the most important part of the nation, 
the serious middle class, and above all by its Non- 
conforming portion.” ? 
~Arnold’s own experience had brought him into 
Pee cthosally near contact with this portion of our 
social organism. As Inspector, during many years, 
of schools not connected with the Church of Eng- 
land, he was necessarily the recipient of the hospi- 
tality of the managers of such schools. He had 
known what it was to be prayed for by name, and 
to have his faults gently hinted at in the family 
devotions. He railed at “the hideousness, the im- 
mense ennui of the life which the Puritan type had 
created.” He described the middle-class Londoner 
as oscillating between a dismal and illiberal life at 
Islington and an equally dismal and illiberal life at 
Camberwell. To him the typical Philistine was one 
who never admired or even knew what was best in 
literature, but only that which is flimsy and epheme- 
ral; who prided himself on upholding the “ dissidence 
of dissent, and the Protestantism of the Protestant 
religion,” who liked tea meetings and Bands of Hope 
and unctuous sermons, and who had a morbid hanker- 
ing after marriage with his deceased wife’s sister. 
Mr. Leslie Stephen has said: 
“Condemned as he was to live and work among the mid- 
dle class, while imbued with the ideas in which they were 
most defective, loving as he did the beauty and the fresh-

PURITANISM 225 
ness of Oxford, the logical clearness and belief in ideas in 
France, the devotion to truth and philosophical thorough- 
ness of Germany, the sight of the dogged British Philistine 
was to him a perpetual grievance.” 
Here is a passage from Friendship’s Garland which 
tells its own story: 
“What makes me look at France and the French with 
inexhaustible curiosity and indulgence is this: their faults 
are not of the same kind as ours, so we are not likely to 
catch them ; their merits are not of the same kind as ours, 
so we are not likely to become idle and self-sufficient from 
studying them. I find such interest and instruction in con- 
sidering a city so near London, and yet so unlike it. It is 
not that I so envy the Frenchman his café-haunting, domino- 
playing bourgeois. But when I go through Saint Pancras 
I like to compare our vestry-haunting, resolution-passing 
bourgeois with the Frenchman, and to say to myself, ‘ This, 
then, is what comes of not frequenting cafés nor playing 
dominoes! My countrymen here have got no cafés, and 
have never learnt dominoes, and see the mischief Satan has 
found for their idle hands to do!’ Still I do not wish 
them to be the café-haunting, domino-playing Frenchmen, 
but rather some third thing, neither the Frenchmen nor 
their present selves.” 
No one who knows England well can deny that 
there is much truth in this kind of criticism. Matthew 
Arnold’s diagnosis of some of our moral ailments was 
undoubtedly keen and just. But it was incomplete. 
He hardly ever did full justice to the many good and 
solid elements of national character which the English 
people owe to Puritanism. The case was in fact one 
of what Charles Lamb was wont to call “imperfect 
Q 
 
-P-A-G-E-238

sympathies.” Neither the British Philistine nor his 
critic ever fully understood or appreciated the other. 
Arnold, with his lofty air of distinction and his high- 
bred manners, sometimes appeared to those whom he 
criticised a rather dandified and supercilious cynic, 
going through the world as one who held a moral 
smelling-bottle at his nose, and exacting an impos- 
sible standard of life from a busy and strenuous 
people who had their living to get. And he, on the 
other hand, never ceased to call attention to their 
want of taste, their intellectual poverty, their great 
need of culture, of beauty, and “of sweetness and of 
light.” This last phrase was seized upon by the 
public and often quoted as a proof of his superfine 
and unpractical ideals. When he went to receive 
the honorary degree of D.C.L. at Oxford, some wits 
suggested that Lord Salisbury, the Chancellor of the 
University, should address him Vir dulcissime et 
lucidissime. But beneath this famous and much 
criticised formula, Arnold had a real meaning and 
conviction, which was not without a serious signifi- 
cance for his countrymen. 
It has been truly said that Arnold’s criticisms did 
not manifest an adequate sense of what the religion of 
the English middle class had really been to it, what 
a source of vitality, energy, and -persistent force. 
“ They who wait on the Lord,” says Isaiah, in words 
not less true than they are noble, “shall renew their 
strength,” and the English middle class owes to its 
religion not only comfort in the past, but also a vast 
latent store of unworn life and strength for future  
-P-A-G-E-239
WHAT ENGLAND OWES TO THE PHILISTINES 227 
progress. There was defective insight and some 
injustice in his failure to recognize this fact. 
A closer study of history would probably have 
modified the contempt, half-amused and half-serious, 
with which Arnold regarded the English middle 
class. There was a time in the latter half of 
the seventeenth century when a great wave of irre- 
ligion and profligacy burst over English society, and, 
if we are to form our judgments solely from books 
of history, would appear to have well-nigh sub- 
merged all the best elements of the national charac- 
ter. But, after all, the vices of the Restoration period 
affected the Court and the upper ranks mainly; they 
touched the surface only of our social life. Down 
deeper lay the great solid mass of Puritan England, 
and in this the inbred probity, self-respect, and sense 
of righteousness remained for the most part uninflu- 
enced by the wildness and licentiousness of the aris- 
tocracy. In like manner the eighteenth century saw 
in the Church of England decorum, learning, and 
many estimable qualities, but also coldness and a 
notable absence of religious fervour or of strong 
conviction. And it was to Wesley and Whitfield, 
and not to ecclesiastics in high places, that we 
owe the evangelical revival of that century. We 
have, as a nation, been in fact saved from moral 
corruption in the seventeenth century, and from 
religious apathy and indifference in the eighteenth, 
not by the influence of the educated and privileged 
classes, but by the great and stedfast qualities of 
that very class of British Philistines against whom

Matthew Arnold directed all his earnest condem- 
nation and all the lighter artillery of his sarcasm 
and his wit. 
There is another consideration which, in reading 
Culture and Anarchy, and books of the like kind, we 
are in some danger of overlooking. The Act of 
Uniformity of 1662, and the series of similar acts 
which constitute what is called the Clarendon Code, 
— Corporation Act, Test Act, Conventicle Act, and 
Five-Mile Act,—had been designed to stamp out 
Nonconformity and had made it a penal offence for a 
Dissenter either to preach in a chapel or to teach in 
any private or public school. For many years those 
who objected to sign the Articles and to conform to 
the worship of the Church of England were subject 
to heavy disabilities, as well as to irritating social 
exclusion. The Schism Act of 1713 enacted that 
“no person in Great Britain shall keep any public or 
private school, or act as tutor, that has not first sub- 
scribed the declaration to conform to the Church of 
England and obtained a licence from the diocesan, 
and that upon failure of so doing the party may be 
committed to prison without bail; and that no such 
licence shall be granted before the party produces a 
certificate of having received the sacrament according 
to the communion of the Church of England within 
the last year, and also subscribed the oaths of alle- 
giance and supremacy.” Until the year 1779 it 
continued to be illegal for a dissenter to act as a 
schoolmaster. The Test and Corporation Acts sur- 
vived till the year 1829, and tests on admission to
-P-A-G-E-241
  
NONCONFORMIST DISABILITIES 229 
degrees in the Universities were not finally abolished 
by Parliament till 1871. 
Thus it is scarcely just or generous on the part 
of churchmen, whose zeal for uniformity of belief 
has caused them during three centuries to exclude Dis- 
senters from the Universities, from schools, from the 
higher professions, and from the public service, to 
reproach their fellow-countrymen with want of culture 
and with an ignoble ideal of education. If the Eng- 
lish Nonconformist exhibited a watchful and habitual 
dread of State interference, it was because he and his 
ancestors had suffered much from such interference in 
days gone by. And if he was deficient in the graces, 
the accomplishments, and the tastes which are the 
products of a high and generous education, it ought 
at least to be remembered in his defence that the 
means of obtaining such education had been for many 
generations deliberately placed out of his reach. 
Probably if Arnold ever fully recognized the weight 
of these and the like considerations, some of his judg- 
ments would have been less severe, and he would have 
wounded and irritated the Nonconformists less. 
That he was not insensible to the value of much of 
the work which they had done, or unmindful of the 
efforts they have made on behalf of education, many 
passages from his reports abundantly prove. Here is 
a sonnet which he wrote after meeting in the Hast 
End a well-known Congregational minister, the Rev. 
W. Tyler, whom as school manager and energetic 
worker in social improvement he had often encoun- 
tered on his inspecting tours: 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  230 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
“Twas August, and the fierce sun overhead 
Smote on the squalid streets of Bethnal Green, 
And the pale weaver, through his windows seen 
In Spitalfields, look’d thrice dispirited. 
“T met a preacher there I knew, and said : 
‘Tll and o’erwork’d, how fare you in this scene?’ — 
‘Bravely !’ said he: ‘for I of late have been 
Much cheer’d with thoughts of Christ, the living bread.’ 
“Q human soul ! as long as thou canst so 
Set up a mark of everlasting light, 
Above the howling senses’ ebb and flow — 
To cheer thee, and to right thee if thou roam — 
Not with lost toil thou labourest through the night ! 
Thou mak’st the heaven thou hop’st indeed thy home.” 
On his favourite theme, the need of a better sys- 
tem of secondary education, he wrote copiously. He 
thought the ideal prevalent among Englishmen of what 
a school ought to be and to do was often mean and 
ignoble. “I havethis year,” he says in a letter tome 
in 1880, “been reading David Copperfield for the first 
time. Mr. Creakle’s school at Blackheath is the type 
of our ordinary middle-class schools, and our mid- 
die class is satisfied that so it should be.” 
And in another letter in 1881, referring to a pro- 
ject for a sort of trades’ union among secondary and 
private teachers, designed partly for improving their 
own qualifications and status, but mainly for the pro- 
tection of their professional interests, he tells me: 
“T have seen the prospectus and will have nothing to do 
with it. It is just the sort of makeshift the English like, 
in order to escape a pressing necessity, such as the total
-P-A-G-E-243
  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS 231 
reform of their middle class education. But a makeshift of 
this kind is not what is wanted. My whole use consists in 
standing out for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth, about our wretched middle class education and its 
needs.” 
By way of illustrating the difference between the 
position of a teacher responsible only to a recognized 
public body, and one whose sole business was to sat- 
isfy and to flatter ill-educated parents, he once wrote: 
“The stamp of plainness and the freedom from charlatan- 
ism given to the instruction of our primary schools, through 
the public character which in the last thirty years it has 
received, and through its having been thus reserved, in great 
measure, from the influences of private speculation, is per- 
haps the best thing among them. It is in this respect that 
our primary schools compare so favourably with the private 
adventure schools of the middle class, that class which Mr. 
Bright says is perfectly competent to manage its own schools 
and education. The work in the one is appraised by impar- 
tial educated persons ; in the other, by the common run of 
middle-class parents. To show the difference in the result, 
I will conclude by placing in juxtaposition a letter written 
in school by an ordinary scholar in a public elementary 
school in my district, a girl of eleven years old, with one 
written by a boy in a private middle-class school, and fur- 
nished to one of the Assistant-Commissioners of the Schools 
Inquiry Commission. The girl’s letter I give first : 
“Dear Fanny. —I am afraid I shall not pass in my 
examination ; Miss C- says she thinks I shall. I shall 
be glad when the Serpentine is frozen over, for we shall have 
such fun; I wish you did not live so far away, then you

SECTIONAL AND CLASS SCHOOLS 
  J 
“To those who ask what is the difference between a pub- 
lic and a private school, I answer, It is this.”? 
There was one class of English schools for which 
Arnold entertained a special dislike — schools erected 
by private, sectarian, or professional bodies for the sep- 
arate instruction of their own children —e.g. schools 
for Clergy orphans, for sons of Freemasons, of Com- 
mercial Travellers, of officers in the Army, of Wes- 
leyans, or of the Society of Friends. Mutatis mutandis 
these institutions were open to the same objections 
which apply to Poor Law schools, or to Ragged 
schools. They are filled in each case with scholars 
who have had the same antecedents and are drawn 
from the same class. Whatever disabilities attach to 
the class, whatever professional narrowness or preju- 
dices belong to the homes from which they come, are 
intensified and rendered more mischievous by bring- 
ing the children together into an artificial community 
of this kind. What such children need most is the 
freer air, and the more varied conditions, which char- 
acterize a good school recruited from different classes 
of society. The happiest thing for a soldier’s orphan, 
for example, is to be placed in a school with other 
children who are not orphans and whose fathers were 
not soldiers. 
On this point Arnold spoke frequently and with 
much emphasis. For example, he thus contrasted the 
public character of some German middle schools under 
crown patronage, with the sectional and quasi-private 
establishments so common at home.

234 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
“But in England how different is the part which in 
this matter our governors are accustomed to play! 
The Licensed Victuallers or the Commercial Travel- 
lers propose to make a school for their children, and 
I suppose, in the matter of schools, one may call the 
Licensed Victuallers, or the Commercial Travellers, 
ordinary men, with their natural taste for the bathos 
still strong. And a sovereign with the advice of men 
like Wilhelm von Humboldt or Schleiermacher may, 
in this matter, be a better judge, and nearer to right 
reason. And it will be allowed, probably, that right 
reason would suggest that to have a sheer school of 
Licensed Victuallers’ children, or a sheer school of 
Commercial Travellers’ children, and to bring them 
all up, not only at home but at school too, in a kind 
of odour of licensed victualism or bagmanism, is not 
a wise training to give to these children. And in 
Germany, I have said, the action of the national 
guides or governors is to suggest and provide a 
better. But, in England, the action of the national 
guides or governors is, for a Royal Prince or a great 
minister to go down to the opening of the Licensed 
Victuallers’ school, or of the Commercial Travellers’ 
school, to take the chair, to extol the energy and 
self-reliance of the Licensed Victuallers or the Com- 
mercial Travellers, to be all of their way of think- 
ing, to predict full success to their schools, and never so 
much as to hint to them that they are probably doing 
a very foolish thing, and that the right way to go to 
work with their children’s education is quite different.”

HYMNS 285 
Although, as we have seen, Arnold attached great 
value both to religion and poetry as factors in national 
education, there is one particular attempt to combine 
the two for which he had a curiously strong, but not 
unintelligible, aversion. He greatly disliked the 
ordinary hymns in use in our places of worship, and 
thought the national taste was degraded by the use 
we are accustomed to make of them. 
“Our German kinsmen and we are the great people for 
hymns. The Germans are very proud of their hymns, and 
we are very proud of ours; but it is hard to say which of 
the two, the German hymn-book or ours, has least poetical 
worth in itself, or does least to prove genuine poetical power 
in the people producing it. . .. Only the German race, 
with its want of quick instinctive tact, of delicate, sure per- 
ception, could have invented the hymn as the Germans and 
we have it: and our non-German turn for style—style, of 
which the very essence is a certain happy fineness and truth 
of poetical perception — could not but desert us when our 
German nature carried us into a kind of composition which 
can please only when the perception is somewhat blunt. 
Scarcely any one of us ever judges our hymns fairly, because 
works of this kind have two sides — their side for religion 
and their side for poetry. Everything which has helped a 
man in his religious life, everything which associates itself 
in his mind with the growth of that life, is beautiful and 
venerable to him; in this way, productions of little or no 
poetical value, like the German hymns and ours, may come 
to be regarded as very precious. Their worth in this sense, 
as means by which we have been edified, I do not for a 
moment hold cheap ; but there is an edification proper to all 
our stages of development, the highest as well as the lowest, 
and it is for man to press on towards the highest stages of 
his development, with the certainty that for those stages, 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
236 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
too, means of education will not be found wanting. Now 
certainly it is a higher state of development when our 
poetical perception is keen than when it is blunt.”? 
And later he says with more decision: 
“Hymns, such as we know them, are a sort of composi- 
tion which I do not at all admire. I freely say so now, 
as I have often said it before. I regret their prevalence 
and popularity amongst us. Taking man in his totality and 
in the long run, bad music and bad poetry, to whatever 
good and useful purposes a man may often manage to turn 
them, are in themselves mischievous and deteriorating to 
him. Somewhere and somehow, and at some time or other, 
he has to pay a penalty and to suffer a loss for taking 
delight in them.” 
Dr. Johnson had in his life of Watts and elsewhere 
expressed the opinion that religious truths and wor- 
ship were not the proper subjects for poetic treatment, 
and that all devotional poetry was for this reason 
more or less unsatisfactory. “The paucity of its 
topics enforces perpetual repetition, and the sanctity 
of the matter rejects the ornaments of figurative dic- 
tion. It is sufficient for Watts to have done better , 
than others what no man has done well.” 
Matthew Arnold, though not entirely for the same 
reason, disliked the current hymnology. He not only 
thought it contained bad poetry, but his fastidious lit- 
erary taste and his sense of humour revolted against 
both its form and its substance. And in truth there is 
much in modern hymn-books to justify his criticism. 
In many hymns there is evident a painful attempt 
1 Study of Celtic Literature.
-P-A-G-E-249
  
RELIGIOUS POETRY 237 
to pack as much theology as possible, rather than to 
raise religious emotion and to express devout aspi- 
ration. In many others the language put into the 
worshipper’s mouth is sadly unreal and exaggerated, 
expressive of a warmth and rapture which is not 
likely to be actually felt, and which it is therefore 
confusing and benumbing to the possessor of a healthy 
conscience to pretend to feel. And a still larger 
number of hymns will be found to be disfigured by 
false metaphors, by prosaic and commonplace expres- 
sions, and by a complete absence of rhythm and poetry. 
Yet I think his rather indiscriminate and almost con- 
temptuous judgment on religious poetry carried him 
too far. The Psalms of David, the medieval Latin 
hymns, such as O sol salutis and the Dies ire, the 
devotional poetry of Wither, of Herbert, of Milton, 
of Cowper, of Doddridge, of Charles Wesley, and of 
Keble, have in successive ages of the Church done 
too much in raising and ennobling the religious aspi- 
rations of men to be so summarily dismissed. Even 
John Henry Newman, long after his conversion to 
the Roman Church, thus commented on the influence 
of Keble’s Christian Year: 
‘‘His poems became a sort of comment upon the formu- 
laries and ordinances of the Anglican Church, and almost 
elevated them into the dignity of a religious system. It 
kindled hearts towards his Church ; it gave a something for 
the gentle and forlorn to cling to, and it raised up advocates 
for it among those who otherwise, if God and their good 
Angel had suffered it, might have wandered away into some 
sort of philosophy and acknowledged no Church at all.” + 
1 Newman’s Essay Critical and Historical, Vol. II., p. 441.  
-P-A-G-E-250
238 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
In fact, religious truth must ever be touched with 
emotion if it is to become a really vital force in the 
world, and when pure and unworldly strivings after 
a higher life are associated with musical words and a 
true poetic instinct, the hymn becomes a real fac- 
tor in the religious life and education of the race. 
For example: 
“O God, our help in ages past, 
Our hope for years to come, 
Our shelter from the stormy blast, 
And our eternal home.” 
And these musical lines from the Stabat Mater: 
“Fac ut ardeat cor meum, 
In amando Christum Deum, 
Ut sibi complaceam.” 
But for all the intellectual and moral ailments 
which he observed and denounced in our social sys- 
tem, for the false taste, the bleakness, and the dulness 
of middle-class life, and for the absence of lofty ideals, 
he had, as is well known, one cure to urge. It was 
not a panacea. But it was the best and most potent, 
and at the same time the most readily available, cor- 
rective he knew. If our middle-class education was 
the worst in the world, if it lacked dignity, thorough- 
ness, and refinement, the remedy was to ennoble our 
secondary schools, and the only possible instru- 
ment for effecting this object was the agency of the 
State. From his official inquiries in foreign countries 
he had, as we have seen, come back with no horror 
of bureaucracy or of a symmetrical system of public 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
PORRO UNUM EST NECESSARIUM 239 
instruction. He thought that Englishmen had car- 
ried their love of freedom and of local and voluntary 
initiative in this matter too far, and that we were all 
suffering for it. He believed that the ideal of a good 
and generous education likely to be formed by respon- 
sible statesmen and enlightened administrators at 
headquarters was likely to prove in the long run 
higher and truer than that formed by vestries, town 
councils, sectarian committees, and local boards. The 
phantom of centralization did not frighten him, pro- 
vided that State agency maintained a due regard to 
the genius, the feelings, the history and traditions 
and religious convictions, of the community. So in 
season and out of season, with a voice like that, as he 
was wont to confess, “of one crying in the wilder- 
ness,” he constantly insisted on the need of attention 
to our great national defect. ‘“ Porro unum est neces- 
sarium. One thing is needful. Organize your sec- 
ondary education.” 
The powers, he was fond of saying, which contribute 
to build up human civilization are the power of con- 
duet, the power of intellect and knowledge, the power 
of beauty, the power of social life and manners. 
Expansion, conduct, science, beauty, manners,— here 
are the conditions of civilization, the claimants which 
man must satisfy before he can be humanized. 
He was not sanguine about the immediate result of 
his preaching on this subject. In his well-known 
lecture, “Hece convertimur ad gentes,” addressed to 
the members of a Workingmen’s College, he says 
mournfully that “the one step towards that general 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
240 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
improvement in our civilization which it is the object 
of all cultivating of our intelligence to bring about, 
the establishment of a genuine municipal system for 
the whole country, will hardly perhaps come in our 
time ; men’s minds have not yet been sufficiently 
turned to it for that.” But subsequent events have 
shown that he undervalued the force and influence of 
his ownerusade. In all later educational controversies, 
in Parliament, at the Universities, at Congresses, in 
meetings of teachers, and in the evidence and reports 
issued by Royal Commissions, his words have been con- 
stantly quoted, his facts referred to, and his authority 
invoked. Notably, the Report of the Royal Commis- 
sion on Secondary Instruction, which was issued in 
1895, proceeds to a large extent on lines which he was 
the first to trace, and recommends a policy which would 
have gone far to realize his hopes. And in the near 
future when English statesmen rouse themselves to a 
perception of the need of a coherent and well-ordered 
system of secondary schools, in which due regard shall 
be had not only to the claims of active life, but to the 
higher claims of the inner life for expansion and for 
purification, the result will be largely owing to the 
stimulus which his writings afforded and to the high 
and generous conception he Had formed of the ends 
which ought to be attained in a liberal education, 
and of the spirit in which we ought to pursue them.

Matthew Arnold is better known, and is likely to be 
longer remembered, as a literary critic and as a poet, 
than as an official or as an advocate of improved 
public instruction. He was especially noticeable for 
the importance he attached to just criticism in rela- 
tion to books and to life. He thought it the main 
function of a true critic first to know and then to set 
up a high standard of literary style and finish, and to 
judge all books by that standard. Criticism, he said, 
is the disinterested endeavour to learn and propagate 
the best that is known or thought in the world. It 
was the business of a critic to detect and to expose 
insincerity, vulgarity, the mere watchwords of parties 
and cliques, and in particular the slovenly and pre- 
tentious use of terms and phrases which were only 
half understood. 
Arnold greatly valued and admired the influence 
R 241
-P-A-G-E-254
242 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
of the French Academy: “a sovereign organ of the 
highest literary opinion, a recognized authority in 
matters of intellectual tone and taste.” Every one 
who knows what it is to take up a French book which 
has been cowronné by the Academy, knows what this 
safeguard means. He thought that the corporation 
of forty of the most eminent French writers exercised 
great power in preserving the purity of their language, 
encouraging learning, and setting up before the whole 
nation a high ideal of beauty and perfection of style. 
Yet he doubted the wisdom of any attempt to intro- 
duce such an institution into England, and he thought 
our faults were not to be cured by that method. 
“Tt is constantly said that I want to introduce here an 
institution like the French Academy. I have, indeed, 
expressly declared that I wanted no such thing. But let 
me notice how it is just our worship of machinery, and 
of external doing, which leads to this charge being brought ; 
and how the inwardness of culture would make us seize, for 
watching and cure, the faults to which our want of an 
Academy inclines us, and yet prevent us from trusting to 
an arm of flesh —as the Puritans say ; from blindly flying 
to this outward machinery of an Academy in order to help 
ourselves. . . . Every one who knows the characteristics 
of our national life, knows exactly what an English Academy 
would be like. We can see the happy family in one’s mind’s 
eye as distinctly as if it were already constituted. Lord

ential, accomplished, and distinguished ; and then, some fine 
morning, a dissatisfaction of the public mind with this 
brilliant and select coterie, a flight of Corinthian leading 
articles, and an irruption of Mr. G. A. Sala. Clearly this 
is not what will do us good. The very same faults — the 
want of sensitiveness of intellectual conscience, the disbelief 
in right reason, the dislike of authority — which have hin- 
dered our having an Academy and have worked injuriously 
in our literature, would also hinder us from making our 
Academy, if we established it, one which would really 
correct them.”? 
But in the absence of any such recognized authority 
he regarded the function of the literary critic as one 
of high value. One of the most interesting acquaint- 
ances he ever made was that of Sainte Beuve, the 
accomplished author of the Causeries du Lundi, whose 
works he greatly admired and whom he met more than 
once in Paris. Of him he says in one of his letters: 
“Sainte Beuve gave me an excellent dinner and was 
in full vein of conversation, which as his conversation 
is about the best to be heard in France was charming. 
I staid with him till midnight, and would not 
have missed my evening for the world. I think he 
likes me, and likes my caring so much about his 
criticisms and appreciating his extraordinary delicacy 
of tact and judgment in literature.” Later, when 
Arnold contributed to the Encyclopedia Britannica a 
memoir of his friend, he used language which with 
little qualification might not inappropriately be ap- 
plied to himself: 
1 Culture and Anarchy.
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 MATTHEW ARNOLD

“He was a critic of measure, not exuberant, of the centre, 
not provincial, of “keen industry and curiosity, with Truth 
(the word engraved in English on his seal) for his motto ; 
moreover, with gay and amiable temper, his manner as good 
as his matter — the ‘critique sourtant,’ as in Monselet’s dedi- 
cation to him he is called. It so happens that the great place 
of France in the world is very much due to her eminent gift 
for social life and development, and this gift French litera- 
ture has accompanied, fashioned, perfected, and continues to 
reflect. This gives a special interest to French literature, 
and an interest independent even of the excellence of indi- 
vidual French writers, high as that office is. And nowhere 
shall we find such interest more completely and charmingly 
brought out than in the Causeries du Lund of this con- 
summmate critic. As a guide to bring us to a knowledge 
of the French genius and literature, he is unrivalled, perfect 
—so far as a poor mortal critic can be perfect — in judg- 
ment, in tact and tone.” ! 
There was much in the serene intellectual detach- 
ment of Marcus Aurelius which to the last appealed 
powerfully to Arnold’s sympathy. “We are all,” 
says the Imperial Philosopher, “working together to

without knowing what they do. But men co-operate 
after different fashions and even those co-operate

those who try to oppose it, and to hinder it; for the 
Universe hath need of such men as these.” . .

POETIC CRITICISM 245 
tion: “Covet earnestly the best gifts!” This was the 
gist of Arnold’s teaching in regard to literature. And 
he devoted much of his keen insight and fine and 
somewhat fastidious taste to the task of helping his 
countrymen to distinguish the good from the bad, the 
noble from the ignoble, the ephemeral from the endur- 
ing, in what they read. And if in doing this he made 
us profoundly dissatisfied with ourselves and with 
much of our current literature, he could not help it, 
and would not have helped it if he could. His lect- 
ures delivered at Oxford on Translating Homer, and 
his Study of Celtic Literature, are full of just and 
subtle criticism, and of comparisons between ancient 
and modern writing, which are not always flattering 
to ourselves, but are always worth remembering. For 
example, take these remarks on Homer and the grand 
style: 
“The ballad-manner and the ballad-measure, whether in 
the hands of the old ballad poets, or arranged by Chapman 
or arranged by Mr. Newman, or even arranged by Sir Walter 
Scott, cannot worthily render Homer. And for one reason, 
Homer is plain, so are they ; Homer is natural, so are they ; 
Homer is spirited, so are they ; but Homer is substantially 
noble, and they are not. Homer and they are both of them 
natural, and therefore touching and stirring ; but the grand 
style which is Homer’s is something more than touching 
and stirring; it can form the character; it is edifying. 
The old English balladist may stir Sir Philip Sidney’s heart 
like a trumpet, and this is much ; but Homer, like the few 
artists in the grand style, can do more ; they can refine the 
raw natural man; they can transmute him. So it is not 
without cause that I say and say again to the translator of 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  Ly / 246 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
Homer: never for a moment suffer yourself to forget our 
fundamental proposition, Homer is noble. For it is seen 
how large a share this nobleness has in producing that 
general effect of his, which it is the main business of a 
translator to reproduce.” ! 
What, too, can be happier than some of his critical 
judgments? For example, this on Wordsworth and 
Byron: from his Essays in Criticism. 
“Wordsworth has an insight into permanent sources of 
joy and consolation for mankind which Byron has not ; his 
poetry gives us more which we may rest upon than Byron’s 
—more which we can rest upon now, and which men may 
rest upon always. I place Wordsworth’s poetry, therefore, 
above Byron’s on the whole, although in some points he 
was greatly Byron’s inferior, and although Byron’s poetry 
will always, probably, find more readers than Wordsworth’s, 
and will give pleasure more easily. But these two, Words- 
worth and Byron, stand, it seems to me, first and pre-eminent 
in actual performance, a glorious pair, among the English 
poets of this century. Keats had probably, indeed, a more 
consummate poetic gift than either of them; but he died 
having produced too little, and being as yet too immature to 
rival them. I for my part can never even think of equalling 
with them any other of their contemporaries, — either Cole- 
ridge, poet and philosopher, wrecked in a mist of opium ; or 
Shelley, beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void 
his luminous wings in vain. Wordsworth and Byron stand 
out by themselves. When the year 1900 is turned, and our 
nation comes to recount her poetic glories in the century 
which has just ended, the first names will be these.” 
‘Dryden and Pope he regarded with admiration, but 
rather as skilful versifiers and the founders of classic

  DRYDEN, POPE, BYRON, WORDSWORTH l aT 
prose than as inspired poets. He saw clearly their 
limitations when he came to compare them with 
Chaucer, with Milton, or with Wordsworth. 
“We are to regard Dryden as the puissant and glorious 
founder, Pope as the splendid high priest, of our age of 
prose and reason, of our excellent and indispensable eigh- 
teenth century. For the purposes of their mission and des- 
tiny their poetry, like their prose, is admirable. Do you 
ask me whether Dryden’s verse, take it almost where you 
will, is not good ? : 
“¢A milk-white Hind immortal and unchanged, 
Fed on the lawns, and in the forest ranged.’ 
I answer: Admirable for the purposes of an inaugurator of 
an age of prose and reason. Do you ask me whether Pope's 
verse, take it almost where you will, is not good ? 
“To Hounslow Heath, I point, and Banstead Down, 
Thence comes your mutton, and these chicks my own.’ 
I answer: Admirable for the purposes of a high priest of 
an age of prose and reason. But do you ask me whether 
such verse proceeds from men with an adequate poetic criti- 
cism of life? from men whose criticism of life has a high 
seriousness, or, even without that high seriousness, has 
poetic largeness, freedom, insight, benignity? Do you ask 
me whether the application of ideas to life in the verse of 
these men, often a powerful application, no doubt, is a pow- 
erful poetic application? Do you ask me whether the poetry 
of these men has either the matter or the inseparable manner 
of such an adequate poetic criticism? whether it has the 
accent of 
“* Absent thee from felicity awhile . . . ? 
or of 
“© And what is else not to be overcome . . .” 
or of 
“¢QO martyr soudod in virginitee !’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  (24 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
I answer: It has not, and can not have them; it is the 
poetry of the builders of an age of prose and reason. 
Though they may write in verse, though they may in a cer- 
tain sense be masters of the art of versification, Dryden and 
Pope are not classics of our poetry : they are classics of our 
prose.” 
Of Gray, too, his appreciation is as guarded and 
careful as it is generous and just. 
“Gray is our poetical classic of that literature and age. 
The position of Gray is singular and demands a word of 
notice here. He has not the volume or the power of poets 
who, coming in times more favourable, have attained to an 
independent criticism of life. But he lived with the great 
poets ; he lived, above all, with the Greeks, through perpet- 
ually studying and enjoying them; and he caught their 
poetic point of view for regarding life, caught their poetic 
manner. The point of view and the manner are not self- 
sprung in him, he caught them of others, and he had not 
the free and abundant use of them. But whereas Addison 
and Pope never had the use of them, Gray had the use of 
them at times. He is the scantiest and frailest of classics 
in our poetry, but he is a classic.”? 
To another poet, Arthur Hugh Clough, whose early 
promise was never fully realized, but to whose genius 
Arnold’s own was in many respects akin, he pays in 
Thyrsis an affectionate tribute, which after Lycidas 
is one of the noblest elegiac poems in our language. 
He also makes in one of his lectures a critical refer- 
ence especially worth transcribing here, because it 
indicates his own exalted conception of the aims of 
the true poet.

MILTON G0) Kee 
“He possessed two invaluable literary qualities — a true 
sense for his object of study and a single-hearted care for it. 
He had both: but he had the second even more eminently 
than the first. He greatly developed the first through 
means of the second. In the study of art, poetry, or phi- 
losophy, he had the most undivided and disinterested love 
for his object in itself and the greatest aversion to mixing 
up with it anything accidental or personal. His interest 
was in literature itself, and it was this which gave so rare 
a stamp to his character, which kept him so free from all 
taint of littleness. In the saturnalia of ignoble personal 
passions, of which the struggle for literary success in old 
and crowded communities offers so sad a spectacle, he never 
mingled. He had not yet traduced his friends, nor flattered 
his enemies, nor disparaged what he admired, nor praised 
what he despised. Those who knew him well had the con- 
viction that even with time, these literary arts would never 
be his. His poem has some admirable Homeric qualities 
out of door freshness, life, naturalness, buoyant rapidity. 
Some of the expressions in that poem Dangerous Corrie- 
vreckan come back to my ear now with the true Homeric 
ring. But that in him of which I think oftenest is the 
Homeric simplicity of his literary life.” 
Arnold’s estimate of Milton also is characterized 
by a generous appreciation and by keen critical dis- 
cernment. For example: 
“‘Milton’s true distinction as a poet, for example, is un- 
doubtedly his unfailing level of style. Milton has always 
the sure, strong touch of the master. His power both of 
diction and of rhythm is unsurpassable, and it is character- 
ized by being always present—not depending on an access 
of emotion, not intermittent, but, like the pace of Raphael, 
working in its possessor as a constant gift of nature... . 
Shakespeare himself, divine as are his gifts, has not, of

the marks of the master, this one— perfect sureness of 
hand in his style. Alone of English poets, alone of Eng- 
lish art, Milton has it. He is our great artist in style, 
our one first-rate master in the grand style. He is as 
truly a master in this style as the great Greeks are, or 
Virgil, or Dante. The number of such masters is so limited 
that a man acquires a world rank in poetry and art, instead 
of a mere local rank, by being counted among them. But 
Milton’s importance to us Englishmen, by virtue of this dis- 
tinction of his, is incalculable. The charm of a master’s 
unfailing touch in diction and in rhythm, no one, after all, 
can feel so intimately, so profoundly, as his own country- 
men. Invention, plan, wit, pathos, thought —all of them 
are in great measure capable of being detached from the 
original work itself, and of being exported for admiration 
abroad: diction and rhythm are not.”? 
In a striking letter to M. Fontanés there is an inci- 
dental allusion to Burke, which will show how power- 
fully Arnold had been impressed with the grave 
wisdom, and yet with what appeared to him to be the 
somewhat limited foresight, of that statesman. 
“ Burke, like Wordsworth, is a great force in that epoch 
of concentration, as I call it, which arose in England in 
opposition to the epoch of expansion declaring itself in the 
French Revolution. The old order of things had not the 
virtue which Burke supposed. The Revolution had not 
the banefulness which he supposed. But neither was the 
Revolution the commencement, as its friends supposed, of a 
reign of justice and virtue. It was much rather, as Scherer 
has called it, ‘un déchainement d’instincts confus, un 
aveugle et immense besoin de renouvellement.’ An epoch 
of concentration and of resistance to the crude and violent

people who were for imposing their ‘renouvellement’ on the 
rest of the world by force was natural and necessary. Burke 
is to be conceived as the great voice of this epoch. He 
carried his country with him, and was in some sort a provi- 
dential person. But he did harm as well as good, for he 
made concentration too dominant an idea with us, and an 
idea of which the reign was unduly prolonged. The time 
for expansion must come, and Burke is of little help to us 
in presence of such a time. But in his sense of the crudity 
and tyranny of the French revolutionists, I do not think he 
was mistaken.” 
Scattered up and down his writings and his familiar 
letters are many passages of this kind, showing a 
genuine and hearty appreciation of excellence in style 
or in thought. But the reader will often find to 
his surprise some outspoken dissent from the popu- 
lar estimate even of the most admired of modern 
authors. For example, he never indulges in any rapt- 
ures about Tennyson, the beauty and finish and the 
musical quality of whose verse did not reconcile 
Arnold to a certain thinness and want of force in his 
writings. “The fault I find with Tennyson in his 
Idylis of the King, is that the peculiar charm and 
aroma of the Middle Ages he does not give in them. 
The real truth is that Tennyson, with all his 
temperament and artistic skill, is deficient in intel- 
lectual power, and no modern poet can make very 
much of his business unless he is pre-eminently 
strong in this.”? Thackeray he did not regard as a 
great writer, and of Charlotte Bronté’s Villette he

    expressed himself with unwonted severity. “No fine 
writing can hide her faults. These will be fatal to 
her in the long run.” ? 
And of Macaulay’s style he says: 
“Tts external characteristic is a hard metallic movement, 
with nothing of the soft play of life, and its internal char- 
acteristic is a perpetual semblance of hitting the right nail 
on the head without the reality.” 
“Macaulay’s view of things is, on the whole, the view of 
them which the middle-class reader feels to be his own also. 
The persons and causes praised are those which he himself 
is disposed to admire; the persons and causes blamed are 
those with which he himself is out of sympathy. The rhetoric 
employed to praise or to blame them is animating and excel- 
lent. Macaulay is thus a great civilizer. In hundreds of 
men he hits their nascent taste for the things of the mind, 
possesses himself of it and stimulates it, draws it power- 
fully forth and confirms it.... At this stage rhetoric, 
even when it is so good as Macaulay’s, dissatisfies. And 
the number of people who have reached this stage of mental 
growth is constantly, as things are now, increasing; in- 
creasing by the very same law of progress which plants the 
beginnings of mental life in more and more persons who, 
until now, have never known mental life at all. So that 
while the number of those who are delighted with rhetoric 
such as Macaulay’s is always increasing, the number of 
those who are dissatisfied with it is always increasing too.” * 
_On the whole it may be safely said that of all the 
iterary critics of our time, none have done more than 
Arnold to purify the national taste, to help men in

MR. GEORGE RUSSELL’S ESTIMATE 
  admiring what is admirable, and in eschewing what 
is tawdry and meretricious in literature. A sentence 
from the generous and affectionate estimate made by 
Mr. George Russell, in the charming little monograph 
which was privately printed in 1889, may be not 
improperly reproduced here, and will not by any real 
student of Arnold’s writings be found to err by ex- 
aggeration or by a too indulgent memory. 
“As a literary critic, his taste, his temper, his 
judgment were pretty nearly infallible. He com- 
bined a loyal and reasonable submission to literary 
authority with a free and even daring use of private 
judgment.) His admiration for the acknowledged 
masters of human utterance— Homer, Sophocles, 
Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe —was genuine and en- 
thusiastic, and incomparably better informed than 
that of some more conventional critics. Yet this cor- 
dial submission to recognized authority, this honest 
loyalty to established reputation, did not blind him 
to defects, did not seduce him into indiscriminate 
praise, did not deter him from exposing the tendency 
to verbiage in Burke and Jeremy Taylor, the exces- 
sive blankness of much of Wordsworth’s blank verse, 
the undercurrent of mediocrity in Macaulay, the 
absurdities of Mr. Ruskin’s etymology. And, as in 
great matters, so in small. Whatever literary pro-—— 
duction was brought under Matthew Arnold’s notice, 
his judgment was clear, sympathetic, and indepen- 
dent. He had the readiest appreciation of true excel- 
lence, a quick eye for minor merits of facility and 
method, a severe intolerance of turgidity and inflation

— of what he called ‘endeavours to render a platitude 
endurable by making it pompous,’ and a lively horror 
of affectation and unreality. These, in literature as 
in life, were in his eyes the unpardonable sins.” * 
The gift of humour is a saving grace for its pos- 
sessor, whatever his duties or pursuits may be. Even 
a lawyer, a clergyman, or a historian who possesses 
it is saved thereby from many mistakes and does his 
work the better for having it. To the literary critic 
it is indispensable. Without it, he is in constant 
danger of seeing things in false perspective and of 
failing to detect latent absurdities and to discriminate 
lesser from greater faults. It is not a gift which can 
be communicated, or can be secured by learning rules. 
It is certainly not a hereditary gift, for Arnold’s 
father was curiously deficient in it. In the son it 
did not reveal itself in the form of merriment or 
fun, but rather in the keener perception of what was 
unreal, tawdry, or pretentious, in a genial sympathy, 
in general openness of mind, and in the capacity for 
seeing significant and insignificant details in their 
true proportion. A marked example of the use of 
this power is to be found in the prefaces to two little 
volumes of Extracts from the poems of Wordsworth 
and of Byron. He could not fail to perceive that the 
former had been led by his love of simplicity and his 
lack of humour to write much that was flat and com- 
monplace, and that the poems of the latter were often 
disfigured by banalités unworthy of his genius. But 
he admired and appreciated both poets, and he sought

THE TIMES NEWSPAPER 255 
to pick out of their writings that work which was of 
finest quality and which best deserved to survive. 
When rebuked by one of his critics for the light 
raillery and vivacity with which he often treated 
serious subjects, he replied: “We are none of us 
likely to be lively much longer. My vivacity is but 
the last sparkle of flame before we are all in the 
dark, the last glimpse of colour before we all go into 
the drab, the drab of the earnest, prosaic, practical, 
austerely literal future. Yes, the world will soon be 
the Philistines, and then with every voice not of 
thunder silenced, and the whole earth filled and 
ennobled every morning by the magnificent roaring 
of the young lions of the Daily Telegraph, we shall 
all yawn in one another’s faces with the dismallest, 
the most unimpeachable gravity.” ? 
After a discussion of the meaning of the Zeit- 
geist, and the tendencies of the modern movement, 
halting and uncertain as it is, towards perfection and 
a higher life, he thus speaks of England’s favourite 
oracle, the Times newspaper: 
“What is the ‘Times’?—a gigantic Sancho Panza fol- 
lowing by an attraction he cannot resist that poor, mad, 
scorned, suffering, sublime enthusiast, the modern spirit ; 
following it, indeed, with constant grumbling, expostulation, 
and opposition, with airs of protection, of compassionate 
superiority, with an incessant by-play of nods, shrugs, and 
winks addressed to the spectators ; following it, in short, 
with all the incurable recalcitrancy of a lower nature, but 
still following it.” *

Notable, too, is the delicate persiflage with which 
he referred to Frederick Maurice, for whom, never- 
theless, he had a real admiration, as one who was 
“for ever beating the bush with profound emotion, 
but never starting the hare,” and to some of the 
forms of what he called “pugilistic dissent,” as 
exhibited in the arena of Birmingham. Even ortho- 
dox Churchmen were more amused than scandalized 
by the well-known sentences in which he summed up 
his investigation of the meaning and history of the 
three Christian creeds; “The Apostles’ as popular 
science, the ‘Nicene’ as learned science, and the 
‘Athanasian’ as learned science with a strong dash of 
temper in it.” 
Many of his severest judgments were passed upon 
contemporaries whose names have already faded into 
oblivion, but who seemed to him representatives of 
some passing and censurable phase of morals or poli- 
tics. Though liberal in his convictions, he was not a 
party man, and his satire was directed impartially to 
the policy of both the great parties in the State; since 
both of them were liable, he thought, to be enslaved 
by claptrap or by the claims of faction. With him, 
it has been said, liberalism was not a creed, but a 
habit of mind. Some of the illustrations of modern 
liberalism and its tendencies which were afforded in 
the United States of America particularly interested 
him. His first impressions before visiting that coun- 
try were gathered from books and newspapers alone, 
and were not favourable. He said: ‘“ Whereas our 
society in England distributes itself into Barbarians,
-P-A-G-E-269
  
AMERICA 257 
Philistines, and Populace, America is just ourselves, 
with the Barbarians quite left out, and the Populace 
nearly.” (To him, it thus seemed that the American 
community formed one gigantic middle class, with 
many of the faults which he had so often and so un- 
mercifully exposed in the British Philistine. He 
said of the Americans that they were not an “in- 
teresting” people. And when, after much delay and 
hesitation, he determined to go on a lecturing tour 
in America, he said in a letter to me: “I don’t like 
going. I don’t like lecturing. I don’t like living 
in public, and I wish it was well over. I shall be 
glad, however, to see an American common school 
with my own eyes.” In fact, he saw much else be- 
sides common schools in his two visits to America. 
He was received with characteristic warmth and kind- 
ness by the leading men in the States; and like all 
others who have crossed the Atlantic and been 
admitted into the interior of many beautiful and 
delightful homes, his prejudices were greatly softened, 
and his admiration for the enterprise, the bright in- 
telligence, the boundless faith in the future, and the 
splendour of the public institutions which character- 
ized America and her people was greatly increased. 
A Word more about America and Civilization in the 
United States, and the volumes of Discourses in 
America will enable a reader to trace the gradual 
alteration which his actual transatlantic experience 
produced, and will account for the warmth with 
which he always acknowledged how much he had 
learned from his visits to the States.

Of the personal charm of his manner, of the 
air of distinction which always characterized him, 
and of the generosity of his nature, it is difficult to 
convey an adequate impression to those who did not 
know him intimately. Professor Max Miiller has 
said of him: “He was beautiful as a young man, 
strong and manly, yet full of dreams and schemes. 
His Olympian manners began even at Oxford; there 
was no harm in them; they were natural, not put on. 
The very sound of his voice and the wave of his arm 
were Jove-like.” At the Council Office, his colleagues 
were wont to look upon his visits as Adam and Eve 
regarded those of the “affable archangel” when he 
partook of their simple fare. He derived genuine 
pleasure from any favourable recognition of his liter- 
ary work. If he thought it was good work, he would 
honestly admire it himself, and would not stoop to 
the affectation of pretending that it was a trifle, or of 
trying to extort a compliment from others by dis- 
paraging his own performance. “Have you read that 
article of mine in the Contemporary?” he would say. 
“Good, isn’t it?” On one occasion I remember that 
there was an unusually severe and contemptuous 
article in the Saturday Review on a book he had just 
written. Meeting him a day or two later, he said to 
me: “Have you seen that article about my book?” 
Twas unable to deny that I had read it, and simply 
replied that I had been sorry to read what was so 
unfair, and that I hoped it had not vexed him. 
“Why should it vex me?” he answered. “You see 
one’s friends enjoy these things so much.”  
-P-A-G-E-271
  MR. JOHN MORLEY’S TRIBUTE 259 
Mr. John Morley has on this point said with equal 
force and fairness: “It is true that Arnold talked, 
wrote, and thought much about himself, but not 
really much more than most other men and women 
who take their particular work and purpose in life 
seriously to heart. He was not the least of an egotist 
in the common ugly and odious sense of that terrible 
word. He was incapable of sacrificing the smallest 
interest of anybody to his own; he had not a spark 
of envy or jealousy; he stood well aloof from all the 
hustlings and jostlings by which selfish men push on; 
he bore life’s disappointments —and he was disap- 
pointed in some reasonable hopes and anticipations 
—with good-nature and fortitude; he cast no burdens 
upon others, and never shrank from bearing his own 
share of the daily load, to the last ounce of it; he 
took the deepest, sincerest, and most active interest 
in the well-being of his country and his countrymen. 
Is it not absurd to think of such a man as an egotist, 
simply because he took a child’s pleasure in his own 
performance and liked to know that somebody else 
thought well of his poetry, or praised his lecture, or 
laughed at his wit?” 
Mr. Augustine Birrell, in one of his clever and 
charming essays, shows a like generous and discrimi- 
ating estimate of his friend’s chief characteristics. - ~~

ment. He conspired and contrived to make things

precisely knowing 1 ae s_be eyond lit, | aE?) “a brave 
and true-hearted man he set himself to make the best 
of it. Its sights and sounds were dear to him. The 
‘uncrumpling fern,’ the ‘eternal moon-lit snow,’ 
‘Sweet William with its homely cottage-smell,’ ‘the 
red grouse springing at our sound,’ the ‘tinkling 
bells’ of the ‘high-pasturing kine,’ the vagaries of 
men, women, and dogs, their odd ways and tricks, 
whether of mind or manner, all delighted, amused, 
tickled him. Human loves, joys, sorrows, human 
relationships, ordinary ties, interested him. 
“The help in strife, 
The thousand sweet still joys of such 
As hand in hand face earthly life.” 
“Tn a sense of the words which is noble and blessed, 
he was of the earth, earthy. ... His mind was 
based on the plainest possible things. What he hated 
most was the fantastic,—the far-fetched, all elabo- 
rated fancies and strained interpretations. He stuck 
to the beaten track of human experience, and the 
broader the better. He was a plain-sailing man. 
This is his true note.”? 
Jowett, the Master of Balliol, who knew him well, 
said afterwards, “The world has been pleased to say 
many complimentary things of him since his death, 
but they have scarcely done him justice because they 
did not understand his serious side —hard work, in-

dependence, and the most loving and careful fulfil- 
ment of all the duties of life.”? 
Another comment, that of a later poet, Mr. William 
Watson, is, though from a different point of view, 
worthy to be remembered: 
“Tt may be overmuch 
He shunned the common stain and smutch, 
From soilure of ignoble touch 
Too grandly free, 
Too loftily secure in such 
Cold purity. 
But he preserved from chance control 
The fortress of his stablished soul, 
In all things sought to see the Whole ; 
Brooked no disguise, 
And set his heart upon the goal, 
Not on the prize.” * 
But, after all, Arnold’s permanent fame will rest 
rather on his poems than on his prose writings. In 
the coming generations, when the educational polities 
of our day shall have become obsolete and have ceased 
to interest men; when the ephemeral literature, the 
sociology, and the personal controversies have passed 
out of view, his name will stand out conspicuously

resentative poets of the latter half of the nineteenth 
century. The future historian of literature who seeks

time, to its intellectual unrest, and to its spiritual

aims and tendencies, will find it here. Matthew 
Arnold will never be a popular poet in the ordi- 
nary sense of the term. He has not the smoothness, 
the finish, and the music of Tennyson, and does not 
choose for the subjects of his verse familiar and 
superficially attractive topics. Some of his best 
work, such as the Strayed Reveller and Empedocles on 
Etna and Dejaneira, presupposes a more or less schol- — 
arly acquaintance with classical forms and modes of 
thought on the part of the reader, and carries him into 
a region remote from modern life and associations. 
To many of his metres, too, the ear of the average 
reader is not yet attuned. In fact, he does not spe- 
cially challenge the attention of average readers at 
all. His ear was often at fault; a few of his lines are 
not easy to read aloud or to sean. And even in poems 
which are full of beauty and of noble emotion, one is 
sometimes irritated by such cacophony as occurs in 
the final line of the sonnet already quoted: 
“Thou mak’st the heaven thou hop’st indeed thy home.”’? 
Moreover, his poems are for the most part overcast 
with thought which at least is serious and not often 
exhilarating. He was wont to say that for the higher 
purpose of literature the people required joy. But 
his own muse was somewhat sombre and introspec- 
tive, and he was heavily weighted with a sense of the 
mystery and gloom and disappointment of human 
life. The vastness and intricacy of the problems 
which yet remain unsolved, and our inability to solve

them, sometimes oppressed him. Of England and 
her destiny he said: 
“The weary Titan with deaf 
Ears and labour-dimmed eyes, 
Regarding neither to right 
Nor left, goes passively by 
Staggering on to her goal ; 
Bearing on shoulders immense, 
Atlanteiin, the load 
Well-nigh not to be borne, 
Of the too vast orb of her fate.” ? 
Readers of In Memoriam and of Christmas Eve and 
Easter Day will be reminded, as they take up Arnold’s 
poems, of the fact that all three —Tennyson, Brown- 
ing, and Arnold — had been greatly influenced by the 
modern critical spirit _in relation to many—venerable 
and consecrated beliefs. Yet these writers did not 
approach modern thought and speculation in the same 
spirit. There is in Arnold little of the-rather—help- 
less lament over an unforgotten but irrecoverable 
belief, such as is to be found in In Memoriam, where 
weak faith i is S seen | trying to come to the aid of weak 
that ilo oe some ‘changes in the form of men’s reli- 
gious life are inevitable, the spirit and the power of _ 
the Christian faith are sure to survive. Nor does 
“Arnold express often the ‘strong sec scorn for some of 
the conventional beliefs which shows itself not less 
in the exasperating ruggedness of Browning’s verse 
than in the less serious scepticism of Shelley’s Queen 
1 Heine’s Grave.
-P-A-G-E-276

Mab. In such poems as Obermann and Stanzas 
from the Grand Chartreuse we have evidence of 
Arnold’s oppressive sense of the burden of life, and 
of the need of restfulness, affection, and calm. 
“ Awhile let me with thought have done, 
And as this brimm’d unwrinkled Rhine, 
And that far purple mountain-line, 
Lie sweetly in the look divine 
Of the slow-sinking sun: 
“So let me lie, and, calm as they, 
Let beam upon my inward view 
Those eyes of deep, soft, lucent hue — 
Eyes too expressive to be blue, 
Too lovely to be grey. 
“Ah! Quiet, all things feel thy balm! 
Those blue hills too, this river’s flow, 
Were restless once, but long ago. 
Tamed is their turbulent youthful glow ; 
Their joy is in their calm.” 
His appreciation of Wordsworth was not confined 
to such criticism as we have already quoted, but 
expressed itself gracefully in verse. 
“ Raised are the dripping oars, 
Silent the boat ! — the lake, 
Lovely and soft as a dream, 
Swims in the sheen of the moon. 
The mountains stand at its head 
Clear in the pure June night, 
But the valleys are flooded with haze. 
Rydal and Fairfield are there ; 
1 On the Rhine.

  THE WORDSWORTHIAN SPIRIT 265 
In the shadow Wordsworth lies dead. 
So it is, so it will be for aye. 
Nature is fresh as of old, 
Is lovely ; a mortal is dead. 
“The spots which recall him survive, 
For he lent a new life to these hills. 
The Pillar still broods o’er the fields 
Which border Ennerdale Lake, 
And Egremont sleeps by the sea. 
The gleam of The Evening Star 
Twinkles on Grasmere no more, 
But ruin’d and solemn and grey 
The sheepfold of Michael survives ; 
And, far to the south, the heath 
Still blows in the Quantock coombs, 
By the favourite waters of Ruth. 
These survive — yet not without pain, 
Pain and dejection to-night, 
Can I feel that their poet is gone. 
* * * * 
“Well may we mourn when the head 
Of a sacred poet lies low 
In an age which can rear them no more ! 
The complaining millions of men 
Darken in labour and pain ; 
But he was a priest to us all 
Of the wonder and bloom of the world, 
Which we saw with his eyes, and were glad. 
He is dead, and the fruit-bearing day 
Of his race is past on the earth ; 
And darkness returns to our eyes.” 1 
That he had caught the spirit of Wordsworth is 
manifest in many of his poems. The experiences of

266 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
a starry night, his solemn musings on the magnitude 
and richness of the visible world, had a tranquillizing 
effect upon him. For example: 
“Ah, once more,’ I cried, ‘ye stars, ye waters, 
On my heart your mighty charm renew ; 
Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you 
Feel my soul becoming vast like you!’ 
“From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven, 
Over the lit sea’s unquiet way, 
In the rustling night air came the answer : 
‘Would’st thou be as these are? Live as they.’ 
“ Unaffrighted by the silence round them, 
Undistracted by the sights they see, 
These demand not that the things without them 
Yield them love, amusement, sympathy. 
“And with joy the stars perform their shining, 
And the sea its long moon-silver’d roll : 
For self poised they live, nor pine with noting 
All the fever of some differing soul. 
“Bounded by themselves, and unregardful 
In what state God’s other works may be, 
In their own tasks all their powers pouring, 
These attain the mighty life you see.” 
“O air-born voice ! long since, severely clear, 
A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear ; 
‘Resolve to be thyself, and know that he 
Who finds himself, loses his misery !’”* 
Examples of his narrative power are best shown in 
his story of Sohrab and Rustum and in Tristram and 
1 Self-dependence.

Iseult. His lyric poems, notably Philomela and the 
Fragment of an ‘Antigone,’ show how thoroughly satu- 
rated his mind was with Greek thought and traditions, 
and how admirably he could unite the sensibility and 
intellectual experience of a modern Englishman with 
the luminousness and simplicity which characterized 
the forms of Greek poesy. His Merope is, with the 
possible exception of Mr. Swinburne’s Atalanta in 
Calydon, the best reproduction since Samson Agonistes 
of both the spirit and the form of the Greek tragedy, 
its ethical purpose, its massive dignity, and the 
solemn, overhanging sense of the greatness of man’s 
destiny, whether seen in warring against adverse cir- 
cumstances, or even in being subdued by them. 
Z _Ane extract more will serve to illustrate his descrip- 
tive power. It was suggested by his visit to the great 
Carthusian monastery in the Alps. 
STANZAS FROM THE GRANDE CHARTREUSE 
The silent courts where night and day 
Into their stone-carved basins cold 
The splashing icy fountains play ; 
The humid corridors behold ! 
Where, ghostlike in the deepening night, 
Cowl’d forms brush by in gleaming white. 
The chapel where no organ’s peal 
Invests the stern and naked prayer — 
With penitential cries they kneel 
And wrestle ; rising then, with bare 
And white uplifted faces stand, 
Passing the Host from hand to hand;

Each takes, and then his visage wan 
Is buried in bis cowl once more. 
The cells !— the suffering Son of Man 
Upon the wall !— the knee-worn floor — 
And where they sleep, that wooden bed, 
Which shall their coffin be when dead! 
The library where tract and tome 
Not to feed priestly pride are there, 
To hymn the conquering march of Rome, 
Nor yet to amuse, as ours are ! 
They paint of souls the inner strife, 
Their drops of blood, their death in life. 
The garden overgrown — yet mild ; 
See, fragrant herbs are flowering there ! 
Strong children of the Alpine wild 
Whose culture is the brethren’s care ; 
Of human tasks their only one, 
And cheerful works beneath the sun. 
-No just estimate of Matthew Arnold’s influence on 
English education is possible without taking into due 
account his position and work in the outside world, 
and especially in the world of letters. He himself 
would have been the first to admit that public educa- 
tion, important as it is, was only one of the interests, 
and not the paramount interest of his life. Yet 
it is surely not a small episode in the history of 
education in England that for thirty years, one of the 
chief administrative offices in the Bureau of public 
instruction should have been filled by one of her most 
illustrious poets. Unconsciously and indirectly his 
influence over his colleagues, over the teachers, and  
-P-A-G-E-281
  GaN THE TWO ARNOLDS 269>- 
pee 
over the children was all the greater because he was 
a poet; for he saw them all with the clear and pene- 
trating eye of genius and not with that of a pedant 
or a merely industrious official. For example, some 
readers of his latest foreign report were a little puz- 
zled to interpret a sentence in which he said of some 
German schools, “Again and again I find written in 
my notes, The children are human.” It is not of course 
to be supposed that he meant to imply that in English 
schools the children were not human; but only that 
speaking as a poet, he recognized in some German 
schools the presence of other influences than those 
of ordinary lessons, the freedom and the naturalness - 
which can come only from a true sympathy between 
teacher and taught. 
He rests in the quiet graveyard of Laleham, close 
to his early home, side by side with his three sons, 
Thomas, Basil, and Trevenen, and a little grandchild. 
Over him is the inscription: — 
There is sprung up a light for the righteous and 
joyful gladness for such as are true-hearted. 
Thus it has been attempted to show that Thomas 
and Matthew Arnold, father and son, have both played 
a conspicuous and influential part in the improvement 
of English education and in the shaping of English 
thought. They did this in different ways. They 
approached the educational problem from very differ- 
ent points of view. One saw it with the eyes of a 
poet and a philosopher, the other with those of an 
earnest Christian teacher and moralist. But they 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
    270 MATTHEW ARNOLD 
were alike in many respects. To both the formation 
of character was an object of more importance than 
the acquisition of knowledge. To both it seemed 
that “conduct was three-fourths of life.” Both were 
disposed to measure a man or boy rather by what he 
is than by what he believes and knows. Both believed 
in the supreme importance of letters, language, and 
the discipline of thought as the instruments for attain- 
ing the desired end. ,Both attached high value to 
<pligions au and moral training; but neither identified 
laies_and_c creeds, To both it seemed ‘that reverence 
for the past and a sympathetic acquaintance with the 
best that has been written and thought in the world 
constituted the most valuable preparation a scholar 
could have for his present duties and for his future 
development. To both the attainments which helped 
a man to live a noble and intelligent life were of 
higher value than those which helped him to ‘ get a 
living,’ however successfully. Both tried to emanci- 
pate themselves from whatever hindrances conven- 
tional and traditional modes of thinking placed in 
the way of a fearless pursuit of truth. 
It must be owned that both set before themselves a 
higher ideal than any we have yet attained, and that; 
we are following after it with halting and feeble 
steps. But if either now or in the days to come 
our great public schools assume a higher tone, and 
our whole system of national instruction is organized 
on a noble and enduring basis; if commercial pros- 
perity is no longer held by any of us to satisfy the
-P-A-G-E-283
  RUGBY CHAPEL 271 
claims of the spiritual and social life; if the standard 
of literary excellence becomes more exalted and more 
pure; and if the splendid triumphs of physical science 
do not succeed in beguiling us into a neglect of the 
older and humaner studies,— the future historian will 
be able to attribute these results in large measure to 
the influence of the two Arnolds. For each of them 
in his own way sought to illuminate the conscience 
of his fellow-countrymen, to make them profoundly 
discontented with what was mediocre and unreal in 
their lives and in their literature, and to enlarge their 
conception of a liberal education so that it should 
include not book-learning only, but “whatsoever 
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, what- 
soever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, 
whatsoever things are lovely and whatsoever things 
are of good report.” 
The characters of both men are well revealed in 
these extracts from a memorable poem which the son 
wrote in November, 1867, on visiting the scene of 
his father’s work.

O strong soul, by what shore 
Tarriest thou now? For that force,

Zealous, beneficent, firm !

Yes, in some far-shining sphere, | 
Conscious or not of the past, 
Still thou performest the word 
Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live — 
Prompt, unwearied, as here ! 
Still thou upraisest with zeal 
The humble good from the ground. 
Sternly repressest the bad! 
Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse 
Those who with half-open eyes 
Tread the border-land dim 
*Twixt vice and virtue ; reviv’st, 
Succourest !— this was thy work, 
This was thy life upon earth.

If, in the paths of the world, 
Stones might have wounded thy feet, 
Toil or dejection have tried 
Thy spirit, of that we saw 
Nothing — to us thou wast still 
Cheerful, and helpful, and firm ! 
Therefore to thee it was given 
Many to save with thyself ; 
And, at the end of thy day, 
O faithful shepherd ! to come, 
Bringing thy sheep in thy hand. 
And through thee I believe 
In the noble and great who are gone ; 
Pure souls honour’d and blest 
By former ages, who else — 
Such, so soulless, so poor, 
Is the race of men whom I see— 
Seem’d but a dream of the heart, 
Seem’d but a cry of desire. 
Yes! I believe that there lived

Who all round me to-day

Hideous, and arid, and vile ; 
But souls temper’d with fire, 
Fervent, heroic, and good, 
Helpers and friends of mankind. 
Servants of God! or sons, 
Shall I not call you? because 
Not as servants ye knew 
Your Father’s innermost mind, 
His, who unwillingly sees 
One of his little ones lost — 
Yours is the praise, if mankind 
Hath not as yet in its march 
Fainted, and fallen, and died! 
See! In the rocks of the world 
Marches the host of mankind, 
A feeble, wavering line. 
Where are they tending? A God 
Marshall’d them, gave them their goal. 
Ah! but the way is so long! 
Years they have been in the wild! 
Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks, 
Rising all round, overawe ; 
Factions divide them, their host 
Threatens to break, to dissolve. 
— Ah, keep, keep them combined ! 
Else, of the myriads who fill 
That army, not one shall arrive ; 
Sole they shall stray ; in the rocks 
Stagger for ever in vain, 
Die one by one in the waste.

Weakness is not in your word, 
Weariness not on your brow. 
Ye alight in our van! at your voice 
Panic, despair flee away. 
Ye move through the ranks, recall 
The stragglers, refresh the outworn, 
Praise, re-inspire the brave ! 
Order, courage, return. 
Eyes rekindling, and prayers, 
Follow your steps as you go. 
Ye fill up the gaps in our files, 
Strengthen the wavering line, 
Stablish, continue our march,

THE MEASUREMENT OF SILENT 
READING 
CHAPTER I 
THE MEASUREMENT OF READING 
When the United States declared war against Ger- 
many, four million picked men were chosen for mili- 
tary and naval service. Many thousands of those in 
the Army were tested by the Psychological Section of 
the Surgeon General’s office. Two types of tests 
were given: the “Alpha test,” which required the 
ability to read and write, and the “Beta test” for 
foreigners and illiterates. Those who failed on Beta 
were subjected to individual testing. Since about 
one-quarter of the men were judged unable to take 
the Alpha test, the results indicate that, if those ex- 
amined were fairly representative of all, there must 
have been over one million of our soldiers and sailors 
who were not able to write a simple letter or read a 
newspaper with ease. 
Lack or Scuootine Nor WHoLLy RESPONSIBLE 
These findings have attracted widespread attention 
and comment; but there is another significant fact 
concerning them that has not been emphasized. 
11
-P-A-G-E-12
  
  This is that although one-fourth of the men could 
not read well enough to take tests based on 
reading, this deficiency was not caused by their 
never having learned to read. The fact is that an 
overwhelming majority of these soldiers had entered 
school, attended the primary grades where reading 
is taught, and had been taught to read. Yet, when 
as adults they were examined, they were unable to 
read readily such simple material as that of a daily 
newspaper. 
Probably no more striking evidence could be se- 
cured of the serious and little realized fact that 
many people, in spite of going to school, never really 
learn to read easily. They do not acquire sufficient 
ability in reading to use it freely as a tool. What 
happens to a child who learns to read, but no longer 
retains the facility when he becomes an adult, is 
something like what happens to many high school 
and college graduates in the matter of French and 
German. They have learned to pronounce and 
translate from the pages of their French and Ger- 
man textbooks, but after leaving school they never 
buy a French story or read a German periodical. 
It may also be noted that some years before the 
outbreak of the European War comments appeared 
in the educational magazines upon the findings of the

French military authorities who tested the reading 
ability of recruits entering the Army in one year 
under the compulsory military service system. The 
results secured were closely similar to those found in 
the recent work among American soldiers. It was 
reported that many thousands of the young French- 
men, who had attended the elementary schools dur- 
ing the compulsory attendance period, were not able, 
upon reaching the age of 20, to use their reading abil- 
ity as an ordinary, everyday tool. Like our own 
soldiers, they would be counted by the census as 
literates; but their literacy was of such low grade as 
to be of little help for ordinary reading purposes. 
In the United States, reading has long been recog- 
nized as the first important subject for a child 
to learn. It is in fact the most important school 
subject that he ever will learn; for the ability to 
read opens the doors to all other fields of human 
knowledge. It makes possible communication with 
others at a distance. It makes available the results 
of other people’s experience, and the conclusions of 
their thinking. The modern interest in education is 
casting out old subjects from the curriculum, and 
introducing new subjects to take their places; but 
with all the changes, made and contemplated, reading 
maintains its supremacy as the most important single 
subject the child can learn. 
The fact that many children never really learn to 
read is not due to indifference on the part of the 
teachers. It is due rather to the fact that, although 
a large proportion of the time of the elementary 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  grades is devoted to reading, educators have not been 
able either to measure the results secured, or to 
make diagnoses in cases of individual difficulty. They 
' have been unable to tell, on the one hand, which 
methods of teaching were successful and which were 
not; or, on the other, what influences were operative 
in preventing children from becoming good readers, 
and how these influences might be overcome. 
BEGINNINGS OF THE MopERN MoveMENT 
The inception of the modern movement for scienti- 
fic measurement in education dates from 1910 and 
was marked by the publication of the first of the 
modern scales for the measurement of classroom 
products. 
This earliest scale was a device for measuring the 
qualities of samples of handwriting in numerical 
terms. The scale itself was a sheet of paper on which 
there were reproduced samples of children’s hand- 
writing, ranging from those that were of such poor 
quality as to be illegible up to other samples of pro- 
gressively better quality, until finally, at the upper 
end of the scale, there were found reproductions of 
handwriting of substantially perfect, or copperplate, 
quality. 
In the monograph which accompanied his scale, 
Dr. Thorndike remarked that, previous to that time, 
educators had been in the same condition with re- 
spect to handwriting as were students of tempera-

2: March, 1910, 1-93.

  ture before the discovery of the thermometer. In 
that early day it had not been possible to measure 
ordinary temperatures beyond the cold, cool, warm, 
hot, and very hot, of subjective opinion. Similarly 
it had, before 1910, been impossible to measure the 
quality of handwriting except by such vague stan- 
dards as that one’s personal opinion was that a given 
sample was very bad, bad, good, or very good, etc. 
This earliest scale was rapidly followed by others 
for measuring the classroom products in different 
subjects and by numerous reports of extensive ap- 
plications of these new educational adjuncts. The 
movement has spread so rapidly that now, at the 
end of its first decade, there are in existence more 
than a hundred standardized tests and measuring 
scales, and over a thousand reports on the results 
secured by using them. 
Neep For Mrasurement In Reapine 
The object of these measurements is to make it pos- 
sible to study education by finding out what the chil- 
dren can do. These new methods make the child and 
not the teacher the center of interest. They proceed 
by measuring the accomplishment of the pupil, 
rather than by analyzing the methods of the teacher. 
Measurements of this sort, that can be easily ad- 
ministered and readily interpreted, are peculiarly 
needed in reading. The recent army tests have fur- 
nished impressive evidence, on a large scale, that re- 
sults of school work in reading need to be improved. 
Such improvement would be greatly facilitated by 
15  
-P-A-G-E-16
    better methods for judging results of classroom work; 
and this fact is clearly indicated by the advances that, 
have already resulted from the use of scales and tests 
for handwriting, arithmetic, and spelling. Much work 
has been done in the measurement of reading, but the 
inherent complexities of the task have resulted in 
tests that are, for the most part, harder to administer 
and far more difficult to interpret than those gener- 
ally used for writing, spelling, and arithmetic. 
Tue PLAN oF THIS Book 
During the past year, the Department of Educa- 
tion of the Russell Sage Foundation has attempted 
to devise a new scale for the measurement of silent 
reading. The aim of the present volume is to de- 
scribe the new scale, Picture Supplement Scale 1, as 
it was finally developed; to relate the experiments 
upon which it is based; and to give a brief account of 
the principles which seemed to be involved in its con- 
struction. The plan of the book is as follows: 
Chapters 2 and 3 describe the new scale which has 
been adopted and the five other scales which pre- 
ceded it and were discarded. 
Chapters 4 to 9 deal with the principles of measure- 
ment which came to be recognized as fundamental 
in any attempt to measure. reading. 
Chapters 10, 11, and 12 recount the statistical pro- 
cedures followed in making the test, assigning scale 
values, and judging the reliability of the results of 
the new scale, Picture Supplement 1.

  SumMMaRY 
1. Tests of American soldiers during the war showed 
that about one-fourth of them were unable to read 
newspapers easily or write simple letters. Investi- 
gations made some years earlier by the French mili- 
tary authorities showed that similar conditions ex- 
isted among recruits entering the French army. 
2. Most of these soldiers in both armies had at- 
tended school during their boyhood and learned to 
read. They had not retained the ability well enough to 
usereading as an everyday practical tool in adult life a 
few years after leaving school. This shortcoming in 
our educational methods and results needs remedy. 
3. Reading is the most important single subject the 
child has to learn. Poor results of schooling are at- 
tributable not to lack of attention but to methods 
which fall short of being fully effective. 
4. The teaching of reading could be rendered more 
effective if good measuring instruments were avail- 
able to show which teaching methods produce the 
best results; what influences are operative in prevent- 
ing children from becoming good readers; and how 
those influences may be overcome. 
5. The plan of the present volume is as follows: 
Chapters 2 and 3 describe the new scale, and the five 
different scales which preceded it. Chapters 4 to 9 
deal with the principles of measurement involved. 
Chapters 10, 11, and 12 recount the statistical 
procedures followed in making the test and scale of

  CHAPTER II 
PS-1, A PICTURE SUPPLEMENT SCALE 
In measuring the child’s handwriting, drawing, or 
composition, the teacher asks, ‘How good isit?” In 
measuring arithmetic she asks, “How many did he 
get right?”; but when reading is under considera- 
tion another and different inquiry arises, and the 
teacher asks, “How much did the child get out of 
what he read?” 
How Mvucu Dm Hz Get Out Or Wuat He Reap? 
Every scale for measuring silent reading is an attempt 
to answer this question by means of having the child 
do something which he can do correctly only if he 
understands the material given him to read. The 
commonest method employed has been to have the 
child read a selection to himself and then reproduce 
it orally or in writing. Thus Mr. Brown! and Mr. 
Courtis? have the children read a long connected story 
and then write as much of it as they can remember.

  published study, Mr. Kallom,! Dr. William Gray,” 
and Dr. Starch, present several short stories or se- 
lections and have them reproduced in the same way. 
The child’s score depends upon the per cent of all 
the ideas which he can correctly remember and repro- 
duce. Mr. Bliss and Mr. Courtis make an additional 
measurement by counting not only the ideas repro- 
duced but the actual words remembered and used by 
the child in his written account. 
Other students have held that measurements such 
as these confuse ability in reading with ability in 
English composition. To overcome this difficulty 
Dr. Gray and Mr. Kallom have added to their tests 
supplementary questions to be answered by the chil- 
dren. This same method is also followed by Mr. 
Fordyce‘ and Mr. Adams.’ They answer the ques- 
tion “What did the child get out of what he read?” 
by saying “As much as he can reproduce in response 
to questions about it.’’*

-P-A-G-E-20
  In a series of experiments recently conducted by 
the School of Education of the University of Chicago, 
evidence has been produced which indicates that the 
question method of testing is superior to that resting 
upon unassisted reproduction because, by utilizing a 
fundamental law of memory and recall, it tends to 
disassociate failures of memory from failures in read- 
ing. 
A child who has read and understood a story is 
often unable to write a connected account of it, be- 
cause his ability to recall ideas in series is limited to 
a span much more brief than that required by the 
story. A score which depends upon the number of 
ideas reproduced will, in such a case, be very low. It 
cannot properly be taken as a measure of his reading 
ability, because it largely depends upon a very dif- 
ferent ability, that of being able to reproduce ideas 
in sequence. 
The good reader understands and notes each idea 
as it is presented; and the location of the idea in the 
series seems to make little difference in the vividness 
with which it is impressed upon him. He is as well 
able to remember ideas near the end of a story as 
those near the beginning, or in the middle. If the 
story is so constructed that such a procedure seems 
to him logical, the child can start at the end of a story 
and work backwards just as far and as efficiently as 
he can when he starts at the beginning and works for- 
ward. Moreover, he can start at the middle and 
work in either direction. 
What he cannot do, is to go very far in the process 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  of recall from the point where he has started. The 
ability to remember points in a series runs in “takes,” 
or short assignments. The child starts readily, re- 
calls several points in their proper sequence, and 
begins to falter. If no help is given, he stops; but if 
he is asked a question he is again stimulated. The 
question acts as a key which opens the way to another 
consecutive series of ideas. He remembers these; 
and, the impulse being over, again falters. Where 
questions are so arranged that they accord with the 
normal recall-spans for the children being tested, they 
greatly relieve the burden upon memory and assist 
in removing the alien memory element from scores 
intended to measure ability in reading. 
Most of the scales and tests for measuring silent 
reading have been based upon the principle of 
required reproduction, with or without questions; but 
the Thorndike Alpha,! Kansas Silent Reading test. 
(Kelly),? Kansas Standardized Silent Reading test, 
part of the Courtis test, and the Haggerty-Noonan 
test‘ seek to eliminate the demands upon memory and 
ability in composition by allowing the children to re- 
read the material upon which they are being tested,

-P-A-G-E-22
and by calling for responses based on the text and in- 
volving a minimum of writing. They seek to answer 
the question ‘“‘How much did the child get out of 
what he read?” by finding out how well he is able to 
answer questions or obey orders based on the reading 
material. In general it may be said that existing 
scales and tests of silent reading seek to answer the 
teacher’s question in three ways: The child got out 
of his reading “‘enough to reproduce,” or “enough 
to answer questions,’ or ‘‘enough to follow direc- 
tions.” 
Limitations oF Existine ScaLEes 
Reference has already been made to the limitations 
of certain of the existing scales, and the efforts that 
have been made to overcome them. Most of the 
tests and scales for measuring silent reading suffer 
from one or more of four important limitations, which 
have been pointed out, not only by teachers who 
have used the tests and scales in their classrooms, but 
by the authors of the measuring instruments them- 
selves. While comments are made in many forms, 
they may be briefly summarized under four groups, 
as follows: 
Tn the first place, the statement is frequently made 
that the tests and scales in question, while endeavor- 
ing to measure ability in reading, actually measure in 
addition other and different abilities. Those which 
utilize the scheme of having the children read a story 
and reproduce it are held by some to measure not 
primarily the ability to read, but rather the ability 
22
-P-A-G-E-23
  
to remember, to write English composition, to dis- 
criminate between words and phrases actually used 
and their equivalents, or to answer questions. The 
tests and scales which present a number of brief para- 
graphs and have the children answer questions about 
them or follow instructions given by them, are spoken 
of as measuring the ability to reason correctly, to in- 
fer, to remember, to do arithmetic, to solve puzzles, 
to resist irrelevant suggestions, to detect absurdities, 
to make ethical judgments, to discriminate between 
the meanings of words, to think in terms of spacial 
relations, to cross out certain letters in a series, 
and so on, through an infinite number of abilities, 
all of which are often found in conjunction with 
the reading process, but none of which can properly 
be called the ability to read. 
A special case of this first type is frequently found 
in tests which are constructed in steps of increasing 
difficulty, so that the child starts at the beginning and 
works up through the series as far as he can go within 
a definite time. In tests of this sort, the final score 
which is assumed to measure the hardest work which 
the child can do, actually measures instead, the hard- 
est work he succeeded in doing in the time he was 
allowed to try. It is held, that is, that scales for 
difficulty reached in a given time, result in mongrel 
scores which are combinations of the difficulty the 
child reached, the speed with which he worked, and 
the accuracy of the work he did. The attempts to 
equate time and accomplishment are frequently held 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  to be invalid and unreliable for purposes of compar- 
ative measurement. 
The second fundamental limitation of existing 
measuring instruments, particularly of those tests 
and scales which consist of a series of different tasks, 
either of ascending difficulty or of equal difficulty, 
is that the different tasks are not consistent, in that 
they do not conform to any single set of conditions 
for testing. In some instances they measure a series 
of different abilities; and the final score is a conglom- 
erate of them all. In other cases, while the ability to 
be measured is approximately the same throughout 
all the tasks, the conditions under which the child 
works are markedly different. One section calls for 
a single response and another for several responses. 
One requires a few seconds to solve correctly, while 
another involves several minutes of rapid thinking 
and working. Again, sections vary in length from a 
single sentence to half a page; some are in small type, 
some in large; some have pictures, some do not. In- 
consistency in the component sections of the testing 
material makes for unreliable scores which cannot 
readily be analyzed or interpreted. 
The third objection commonly found against tests 
and scales for measuring silent reading is that they 
are difficult to administer and score. Some of them 
require a full classroom period or more. Others 
are to be given for so short a time that a stop-watch 
is necessary if the conditions of the test are to be 
strictly complied with. Still others require care- 
fully timed individual testing, so that their use for a 
24
-P-A-G-E-25
  large class is practically out of the question. Again, 
most of the tests are long and difficult to score. 
They require keys to which the teacher can refer, to 
find what the correct answer should be; or they de- 
mand the counting of words, judgment as to the 
proportion of ideas reproduced, and so on. In most 
cases, scoring the results is so long and hard a task 
that it proves a heavy burden upon the busy class- 
room teacher. 
Finally, most of the existing tests and scales can- 
not be used for comparing the achievements of in- 
dividual children with the achievements commonly 
found for other children of like amounts of maturity 
and training. Scores as gathered are frequently 
thrown together, so that it is impossible to separate 
the records of third grade children from those of the 
fourth grade, fifth grade, and so on. Again, scores 
are presented in terms of the numbers of tasks cor- 
rectly done, but no information is given as to how 
these numbers rank in comparison with the numbers 
usually found for each given grade. Scores are not 
turned into their equivalent scale values for the sep- 
arate grades, and it is therefore impossible to com- 
pare the relative standing of one child with the stand- 
ing of most other children who belong to the same 
grade and have therefore presumably been given the 
same opportunity to learn as has he. 
These, then, are the four limitations commonly 
recognized for the existing tests and scales for mea- 
suring silent reading. They are, first, that the in- 
struments in question measure not only reading 
25  
-P-A-G-E-26
ability, but other abilities widely different from it; 
second, where such tests and scales consist of separ- 
ate tasks in a series, these tasks are not consistent in 
character; third, most of the tests and scales are dif- 
ficult to administer and hard to score; and fourth, in- 
formation is frequently lacking whereby the achieve- 
ments of an individual child can be compared with 
the achievements of other children in his own grade. 
Reapine For Pracricat Purposes 
The new silent reading scale, Picture Supplement 
Scale 1, is an attempt to devise an instrument which 
shall be free from these four fundamental limita- 
tions. It is designed to measure silent reading ability 
by strictly utilitarian standards. The general scheme 
is to present a series of pictures and paragraphs about 
them. These paragraphs consist of instructions 
which the pupil follows by marking with his pencil a 
line or lines to supplement the picture. His ability 
to do this in accordance with the printed instruc- 
tions reflects the rapidity and accuracy with which 
he can read. 
The aim of such a test is to find out how much 
printed material of a given level of difficulty the child 
can read “well enough for all practical purposes.” 
The attempt is to devise a test in which the child can 
readily succeed if he reads well enough to grasp the 
important thought in each section, and in which he 
cannot succeed at all unless he does comprehend each 
important thought. This is the interpretation which 
has here been put upon the phrases “utilitarian read- 
26
-P-A-G-E-27
  
ing,” and reading “good enough for all practical 
purposes.” The attempt has been made to keep the 
test of a uniform level of vocabulary and phraseology, 
and of a uniform level of thought difficulty, and then 
find out how much of the kind of reading involved 
the child can do within a given amount of time; which 
in this case has been fixed at five minutes. 
The scale itself is a single sheet of paper 12 inches 
wide and 19 inches long. The sheet is divided into 
five columns. Each column is divided into four sec- 
tions, and in each of these sections there are a picture 
and a paragraph about it. The instructions are ex- 
tended though the paragraphs in such a way that 
they cannot be fully grasped unless the entire para- 
graph is read. They are so worded that they cannot 
be misunderstood in moderately careful reading; and 
can be correctly followed in only one way. The child 
who guesses is almost sure to make a mistake; but if 
he reads carefully his answering markings will be 
“right”; that is, they will be in accord with the in- 
structions given him. His score is the number of 
paragraphs which are marked “right.” 
This picture supplement scale has been given the 
office designation of PS-1. The five columns of the 
scale, reduced to two-thirds of their actual size, are 
reproduced on the five following pages.

      1. This naughty dog likes to steal bones. When he 
steals one he hides it where no other dog can find it. 
He has just stolen two bones, and you must take your 
pencil and make two short, straight lines, to show 
where they are lying on the ground near the dog. 
Draw them as quickly as you can, and then go on.        
     
         2. This man is an Eskimo who lives in the far north 
where it is cold. There has just been a big storm, and 
all the ground is white with snow. The man has been 
walking and has made many footprints in it. With your 
pencil quickly make four of these in the snow just 
behind him.              
   
      
  — | = 
3. This book is lying on the desk, but it is hard to make 
it stay open. With your pencil draw a single straight 
line to represent a ruler lying across the book to hold 
the pages open. Be sure to make the line from one 
side to the other, across the book, instead of making 
it go up and down.      
     
          
         4, This savage Indian is going to war, as you can tell 
because he wears-a war bonnet trimmed with eagle 
feathers. Three of the feathers have fallen out, and 
you must quickly draw them lying on the ground behind 
him. One of them is very near him and the other two 
are lying side by side farther off.        
     
 
-P-A-G-E-29
5. Have you ever seen such a strange bird? He is hard 
to find because he sleeps in the woods during the day 
and does not come out until night. Take a pencil and 
tell people what the bird’s name is by writing the word 
OWL, with a capital O, under the books on which the 
bird is standing. 
6. This small chap is afraid to start for school. The 
teacher will scold unless he brings his books; but the 
big owl is sitting on them. Grasp your pencil bravely 
and cross the owl out of the previous picture with two 
black lines, so that the child can rescue his belongings. 
Remember not to use more than just two lines. 
7. These two flags are used as signals to give notice of 
changes in the weather. The white flag means fair; so 
you may now take your pencil and make a capital F 
under the white flag, to stand for fair. The blue flag 
means storm; so make a capital S under the blue one. 
8. A man is riding in this covered chair. He does not 
want to be seen; and you may take your pencil and 
blacken the windows so that no curious person can 
peek in. Then, blacken the lower part of the chair 
and the handles; so that it will look as if the whole 
chair was painted black. Work quickly.

    9. Here is a Christmas pudding with five lighted candles 
ateach side. You must take your pencil and make five 
little lines to stand for the five matches that were used 
to light these ten candles. Put three of them on one 
side by one candlestick, and two of them on the other 
side by the other candlestick. 
          
      
       10. Help this gay and lively young lady to have a happy 
time playing all by herself by taking your pencil and 
drawing a skipping rope with the two ends held in her 
two hands, and make the rope so that everyone can see 
that it is just passing beneath her feet as she skips 
over it, 
           
       
         11. Here is another picture of the little girl who owns 
the skipping rope. This time she has a big hoop in one 
hand, but you may make a picture of her skipping rope 
with oneend held in her hand and the other end dragging 
on the ground behind her, since she cannot use it while 
she has her hoop. 
          
       
      
    12. The children will soon find the gifts Santa Claus 
left in their stockings. Since the littlest girl will wonder 
what is in hers, draw a hole as fast as you can in the 
foot of the littlest stocking so that she can peek in, but 
be careful not to make any in the toes of the three 
other stockings.

      13. This butterfly has been living in a warm cocoon, 
but now he has come out and is flying around exploring 
the world. He is beginning to grow tired; so you 
must draw a little stick under his feet on which he is 
resting, and another one above him to which he can 
easily fly.        
        
      14. This man is playing in a bowling alley at his club. 
Each player rolls two balls, one after the other. This 
man has already rolled one and you may make a little 
circle in front of him to show where it went, and after 
that make two more just behind him for the next player 
to use. 
   15. This proud old eagle with spreading wings is in a 
very risky place on a big smooth glass ball. Please keep 
the ball from rolling and upsetting the eagle by taking 
your pencil and quickly drawing one large stone close 
against the ball on one side and two little stones close 
against it on the other side.       
          
    16. This new weather flag shows that cold weather is 
coming. To make all the flags on this page tell the 
truth go back to the white flag that you marked with an 
F and make a little black square in the middle of it. 
When you have done this cross out the letter F below 
it that you made earlier. 
                  
 
-P-A-G-E-32
    17. This happy man works in an office and is carrying 
@ great many papers to the boss’s desk. He has just 
dropped two of them, and you must draw them lying on 
the floor. To do this make one small square on the 
floor in front of him and another one lying on the floor 
behind him. 
18, This man is. blowing soap bubbles with his long 
pipe, and he has three bowls of soapy water on the rug 
beside him. Draw one round bubble still fastened to 
the upper end of his pipe, and after you have done so, 
draw two more floating in the air in front of him. 
19. When the road is rough the porter finds it hard to 
push this wheel chair. Draw a line to show where the 
road is. Be sure to make the line in front of the chair 
smooth so that the chair will roll along easily, but make 
the line in back of it uneven because up to this time 
the path has been rough. 
20. Years ago children learned in school to make fancy 
letters that were pretty but hard to do. This one is an 
M and you may show how much more sensible our 
present methods are by making a printed capital M on 
one side of this picture and a written capital M on the 
other side of it.

  At the bottom of the sheet, underneath the testing 
material, are instructions to the teacher for giving 
the tests, marking the papers, and giving credit for 
each number of paragraphs right. A table is fur- 
nished by which scores can be turned into credit 
marks for each grade from the third through the 
eighth, and the distributions of credits usually found 
in those grades are shown by text and diagram. The 
instructions for giving the test, marking the papers, 
and assigning credits, and the statement of results 
usually found, are reproduced below. Following 
them are reproductions of the scale-table, and the 
diagram showing the typical grade distribution of 
children according to their silent reading ability. 
Givine THE Txrsts.—1. See that each child has a pencil 
and that the teacher hasa watch. 2. Distribute scales, face 
down. 3. Have children write on backs of sheets their names, 
grade, and date. 4. Tell children they are to have a test in 
reading. Hold scale up and explain that each paragraph tells 
them to do something to the picture above it with their 
pencils. They must read carefully, to make sure just what 
they are todo. They are to read and mark the paragraphs 
in order, starting at the top and working down, through 
the first, second, third, and so on. They must do as many 
as they can in five minutes. 5. Make sure that the pupils 
understand, then tell them to turn papers over and begin. 
Allow exactly five minutes. Collect papers. 
Marxine THE ParErs.—Count every paragraph correct 
in which the marking, no matter how crude it may be, exactly 
follows instructions. Count every paragraph wrong in which 
the marking does not exactly follow instructions. Remember 
this is a test of reading, not of drawing. The pupil’s score is

    the number of paragraphs correctly marked. Write this num- 
ber at the top of the paper. 
Grvine Crepit.—The credit to be assigned in each grade 
for each number of paragraphs correctly marked is shown in 
the table at the right. A third grade child having ten para- 
graphs right should be marked 80, a fourth grade child having 
seven right, 50, and so on. Credits in table are for February 1. 
To adjust for other periods add or subtract from each child’s 
mark as follows:

A Scate For Amount Dons 
The new scale for measuring silent reading, Picture 
Supplement Scale 1, has four outstanding character- 
istics. The first of these is that it makes a definite 
attempt to measure a single ability, and that is the 
ability to read silently a single type of material, at 
a constant level of difficulty, in a fixed period of time. 
It measures the amount of reading of a practically 
useful nature which the child can do in five minutes. 
The amount of such reading is the important thing 
to measure, because, when grades of performance are 
equal, the difference in speed amounts to the differ- 
ence in efficiency. This fact is illustrated by common 
experience. Of several typists who are equally accur- 
ate in copying, the one who turns out the most pages 
in an hour is the best worker. Again, on a newspaper, 
where two reporters write equally accurate and inter- 
esting stories, the one who gets his copy to the editor- 
ial desk with the greater speed is the one who receives 
the harder assignment. Of two tennis players who 
can place the ball with equal accuracy on the other 
side of the net, the one with the more speed wins. 
35  
-P-A-G-E-36
  In these, as in most other walks of life, efficiency 
means “‘the ability to get it right the first time.” 
In reading there is almost always a demand for 
speed. In the early discussions of rates of silent read- 
ing, high school and college teachers reported cases 
of students who, although of excellent standing in 
most of their subjects, were making poor records in 
classes where large amounts of supplementary read- 
ing were assigned. It was found that, with these 
students, the rate of silent reading was often so slow 
that they were genuinely unable to keep up with the 
pace easily set by their classmates. There are stu- 
dents who read the ordinary novel at the rate of 15 
pages an hour; and there are others, often in the same 
classroom, who can read the same novel at the rate 
of 150 pages an hour. It is, moreover, true that while 
there are exceptions to the rule, rapid readers are usu- 
ally those who get most out of what they read; in 
general, speed and comprehension increase together. 
In emphasizing speed, then, we are indirectly empha- 
sizing comprehension; and the measure which is of 
greatest importance to those who are teaching read- 
ing is that which answers the question, ‘How much 
can he get, right, how fast?’’! 
ContTro.uine Factors Kepr Constant 
The second characteristic of the new scale is that a 
distinct attempt has been made to locate and recog-

  nize the factors which control the results secured in 
silent reading; and, with the exception of the speed 
with which the child reads, to maintain them con- 
stant throughout the testing, so that their influence 
will not enter into the differences of the results se- 
cured. 
The controlling factors in silent reading are nu- 
merous. The following list shows 25 which were espe- 
cially studied and kept in mind in making the pres- 
ent tests; and upon inspection it will be seen that each 
of these 25 might be divided into sub-sections, exten- 
sions, and ramifications, in endless variety.

Of this long list of controlling factors, one, the time 
required by the child to read a paragraph correctly, 
was adopted as the variable to be measured; and the 
other 24 with their various subdivisions were, in so 
far as was practically possible, retained at constant 
levels throughout each paragraph of the test. 
THouGcHT, VOCABULARY, AND STYLE 
In general, an examination of the scale as finally 
produced will show the method adopted for treating 
each of the 25 controlling factors which were espe- 
cially considered in the construction of Picture Sup- 
plement Scale 1. It is worth while, however, to make 
special comment on a few of the more important 
points, in order to indicate the sorts of standards 
which were selected to guide the construction of the 
testing material. 
For example, every paragraph consists of directions 
for doing something with a pencil to the picture 
above it, and the things which the child is asked to do 
are always simple, and always equally simple. Re- 
marks which do not bear on the task required have 
38
-P-A-G-E-39
been ruled out, so that, as far as possible, no conflict- 
ing interests enter. The thought is always of the 
same kind, and always simple. Instructions which 
call for technical thinking are eliminated. There are 
no puzzles or catches, and the paragraphs have been 
carefully revised after testing, to remove accidental 
ambiguities. Care has been taken to emphasize the 
particular points in the instructions on which suc- 
cessful scores depend. 
Pictures which are uninteresting have been dis- 
carded, and so also have the pictures or paragraphs 
so especially interesting that they are apt to start the 
child’s imagination working and make him forget 
what he is required to do. The attempt has been 
made to write all the paragraphs in such a way that 
the ordinary child will enjoy following the directions 
of each one and will be eager to attempt the next. 
The vocabulary used is that of ordinary newspaper 
English. Long, strange, and technical wordsareruled 
out; and most of the words used are taken from two 
sources. The first source is the list compiled by Mr. 
R. C. Eldridge of Niagara Falls! in his analysis of the 
vocabularies of 250 different articles taken from 
newspapers, and the second is the “Foundation vo- 
cabulary”’ of the 1000 commonest words, compiled 
by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, and used as the basis for 
his spelling scale.”

-P-A-G-E-40
  Since the thought of all the paragraphs is kept of 
uniform difficulty and simple, it has been an easy 
matter to make the style conform to that of ordinary 
newspaper English. The style is not so simple 
as that of the first grade reading book, nor is it as 
hard as much of the material found in text books. 
The standard of the newspaper story has been, so 
far as possible, maintained throughout. 
It should be noted, however, that while style and 
vocabulary are like those of the ordinary newspaper, 
the type of reading required by the test is of a dif- 
ferent nature from the newspaper requirement. 
Newspaper reading calls for the ability to read rap- 
idly but it does not usually require exact attention. 
The scale calls for reading with careful attention to 
details, and the pupil is required to read each para- 
graph well enough to follow its instructions correctly. 
It is a test of careful reading. 
Memory Span 
Since these scales do not employ tests in reproduc- 
tion the chief memory obstacle to measuring reading 
is avoided. The attempt has been made to do two 
things: first, to reduce the number of ideas which the 
child must hold in mind to so few that any normal 
child is able to carry them. To do this all the para- 
graphs have been re-written until the separate ideas 
presented are gathered in, and made subsidiary to 
one central thought. Each separate idea has been 
made so much a part of the central concept that the 
child is not aware of any separation between them. 
40
-P-A-G-E-41
  The instructions are sufficiently definite so that the 
child cannot follow them correctly without reading the 
entire paragraph, but they are knit together closely 
enough to seem like a single direction to the child. 
The second rule followed in the construction of the 
scale is to keep the memory requirement uniform 
through all the paragraphs. So far as possible, no 
heavy memory loads have been permitted to enter; 
and where experiment indicated that the memory 
element complicated the reading difficulty the para- 
graph has either been removed or re-written. 
PLANNED FOR CLassrooM UsE 
The third important characteristic of Picture Supple- 
ment Scale 1 is that it is simple to administer and 
easy to score. While there is need for much individ- 
ual testing, by far the greater part of measuring 
school results must be done by groups or classes if it 
is to be done at all. It was therefore decided to make 
the new silent reading scale in such a way that an en- 
tire class could be tested at one time. To make this 
feasible it was also necessary to have the test short 
so that it could easily be carried through in part of 
one period, and to have the method of scoring quick, 
easy, and accurate. 
A time limit of exactly five minutes has been estab- 
lished for testing. The time allowed is long enough 
to prevent accidental delays in starting, etc., from 
having too great weight in the final score. It is short 
enough to avoid an accumulation of undistributed 
perfect scores, due to children finishing before the 
time is up. 
41
-P-A-G-E-42
  The advantage of using the picture device is ob- 
vious when the problem of scoring is under consider- 
ation. The teacher who has read the paragraphs 
of the scale knows exactly what is required of the 
child. She does not have to consult an answer list 
or carry through complicated mental calculations to 
see if the child is right; she has merely to glance at 
the picture. The matter of finding the score becomes 
the simple process of counting the number of pictures 
correctly marked. 
If scales are to be used in classroom work, they 
must be inexpensive. It was decided to cut out every 
unnecessary item of cost. Illustrations are small and 
easily reproduced. Sheets are used instead of pam- 
phlets; first, toavoid the costs of folding and stapling, 
and, second, because they have proved considerably 
more convenient in the classroom, since the children 
cannot start at the wrong place, or turn over two 
pages at a time, and the teacher does not have to 
turn pages in scoring. 
Another, and important, feature which seemed de- 
sirable was that the new scale should be made avail- 
able in several forms, so that tests could be repeated at 
frequent intervals; and that after the first results 
were secured, additional scales could be prepared 
from time to time as the need for them became evi- 
dent. The simplicity of the materials and of the 
method adopted has made this possible. By the 
time this book is published, Picture Supplement 
Scales 2, 3, and 4 will probably be ready for dis- 
tribution. These scales are of the same type and 
42
-P-A-G-E-43
  
difficulty as PS-1. They may be used interchange- 
ably; and scores in one may be directly compared 
with scores in another. 
Grape Scorgs AssIGNED EQuIVALENT GRADE 
VALUES 
The fourth outstanding characteristic of Picture Sup- 
plement Scale 1 is that the results of testing are se- 
cured in the form of distributions of scores for each 
separate grade, from the third to the eighth inclusive. 
These distributions form the basis for grade scales in 
which each number of paragraphs correctly read is 
assigned a credit or value which indicates where it 
stands along the base line of its grade distribution. 
That is, the scales showfor each grade whether a given 
score is the worst score commonly found among 100 
typical children of that grade, or the best score, or the 
middle score, or what other position it holds with 
reference to all the scores which are commonly found 
for children in the grade in question. It is possible, 
therefore, in testing with Picture Supplement Scale 
1, for each child to be judged by a jury of his peers; 
his ability is measured in terms of its relation to the 
known abilities of other children who are approxi- 
mately of the same degree of maturity, and have re- 
ceived approximately the same amounts of training 
as himself. 
SUMMARY 
1. Every scale for measuring silent reading is an at- 
tempt to answer the teacher’s question, ‘How much 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  did the child get out of what he read?” by having 
him do something which he can do correctly only if 
he understands what he reads. The three ways in 
which this has usually been attempted are to have the 
child read and reproduce; or read and answer ques- 
tions; or read and follow directions. 
2. Four limitations of existing tests and scales are 
recognized. These are, first, that they are not all 
genuine measures of reading ability; second, that 
where they consist of a series of tasks, these tasks are 
not consistent in character; third, that they are hard 
to administer and difficult to score; and fourth, that 
they do not always furnish data whereby the achieve- 
ments of an individual child can be compared with 
the achievements of other children in his own grade. 
3. The new scale for measuring silent reading, 
Picture Supplement Scale 1, is designed to measure 
reading by strictly utilitarian standards. The at- 
tempt has been to devise a test in which the child can 
readily succeed if he reads well enough to grasp the 
important thought in each section, and in which he 
cannot succeed at all unless he does comprehend each 
important thought. The amount of this kind of read- 
ing which the child can do in five minutes is the vari- 
able which is to be measured. 
4. The scale has four outstanding characteristics. 
The first is that it makes a definite attempt to 
measure a single ability, which is the ability to read 
silently a single type of material, at a constant level 
of difficulty, in a fixed period of time. It measures the 
44
-P-A-G-E-45
  amount of reading of a practically useful nature 
which the child can do in five minutes. 
5. The second outstanding feature of the new 
scale is that a careful attempt has been made to dis- 
cover the controlling factors in silent reading. Some 
25 such factors have been identified. One, the child’s 
rate of reading, has been adopted as the variable to 
be measured; and the remaining 24 factors have been, 
in so far as possible, held constant. It is believed that. 
by following this method, a test has been prepared 
in which every task presents the same type of reading 
difficulty as every other, and for which the scores 
represent comparative amounts of one single sort of 
reading ability. 
6. The third outstanding feature is that the test is 
planned for classroom use. It can be given to large 
numbers of pupils simultaneously. It requires five 
minutes for actual testing; and can be scored accu- 
rately, rapidly, and easily. The cost of printing has 
been kept low; and companion editions can be pre- 
pared as need arises. Three such alternate editions 
have already been prepared as Picture Supplement 
Scales 2, 3, and 4. 
7. The fourth outstanding feature is that grade 
scores have been turned into equivalent scale values 
for those grades. This makes it possible, in testing 
with Picture Supplement Scale 1, to measure the 
ability of each child in terms of its relation to the 
known abilities of other children who are approxi- 
mately of the same degree of maturity, and have re- 
ceived approximately the same amounts of training.

  CHAPTER III 
PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS IN MEASUR- 
ING SILENT READING 
During the experimental work which produced the 
scale that has been described in the previous chapter, 
several other tests and scales were developed and 
tried out in different city school systems. In all, six 
scales were printed and slightly more than 10,000 
copies of them were used by children in the public 
schools of nine cities. One of these was the scale des- 
ignated as PS-1 which has already been considered. 
The remaining five will be described briefly in this 
chapter in the hope that the experiences recorded as 
to their nature and the results of applying them may 
be of use to students of educational measurement. 
These five scales were all of the same general plan 
as PS-1; that is, they were all on sheets of paper 11 
inches wide and 19 inches long, divided into five col- 
umns of four divisions each. All the scales consisted 
of pictures and paragraphs of instructions about the 
pictures. On the pages that follow brief accounts 
will be given of each of the five preliminary scales. 
No attempt is made to reproduce them in full, with 
pictures, method of scoring, etc., but the text of each 
46
-P-A-G-E-47
  is given, in the appendix at the end of this volume, in 
the hope that it may be of suggestive value. 
Two Harinc-REApING ScALEs 
The first two scales to be developed were given the 
office designations of HR-1 and HR-2. These were 
the Hearing-Reading scales. The Hearing-Reading 
scales were printed on both sides. On the front side 
were 20 pictures. The teacher read aloud instruc- 
tions for marking each picture with a pencil, and the 
children, having listened to the instructions, pro- 
ceeded to follow them. After all the pictures on the 
front of the sheet had been so marked, in accordance 
with instructions to which the children had listened, 
the sheets were turned over. On the back was a sim- 
ilar set of pictures, but in this case the instructions 
were printed directly beneath each one. Instead of 
listening to the teacher reading aloud, the children 
read the paragraphs for themselves and, as they fin- 
ished silently reading each paragraph, they followed 
the instructions it gave by marking the picture above 
it with their pencils. 
Both the paragraphs read aloud by the teacher and 
the printed paragraphs that the children read to 
themselves were graded in ascending difficulty of vo- 
cabulary from very simple ones at the beginning to 
extremely difficult ones toward the end of each scale. 
Each paragraph on one scale corresponded to an- 
other of the same difficulty on its companion scale. 
The underlying idea of these hearing-reading scales 
was to use them first to secure a record of the ability 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  of the child to follow instructions received through 
hearing them, and then to secure a second record of 
his ability to follow another set of instructions, of 
equal difficulty, when he had to get their meaning by 
reading them himself. Both sets of records having 
been secured, they were to be compared in order to 
find out how nearly the child, when reading, could 
equal the record that he made when he listened and 
did not have to read. 
The Hearing-Reading plan was laid aside for two 
reasons. The first reason was that it was found im- 
possible to control the administration of the oral 
testing by the teacher, so that it would be constant. 
for all children. Some teachers read fast and others 
slowly; some enunciated clearly and others spoke 
with such a marked accent that the children could 
understand them only with difficulty. Moreover, 
since the paragraphs of the hearing-reading scales 
increased in vocabulary difficulty, there were some 
teachers who were unable to pronounce all the words, 
and so did not succeed in reading them properly 
aloud. 
The second problem encountered in the hearing- 
reading scales was the difficulty of interpreting the 
scores. In general children who are just beginning to 
read do better when hearing instructions than when 
reading them; but after the early stages of reading 
have been passed, the relationship is usually reversed; 
so that in the upper grades, where children have 
acquired facility in reading, they are likely to make 
a better score with printed instructions than with 
48
-P-A-G-E-49
those which are given to them verbally. It was evi- 
dent from the results of preliminary testing that the 
hearing-reading relationship gives promise of valu- 
able material for the diagnosis of reading ability; but 
it was also clear that much more careful and extended 
experimenting would be necessary, in order to secure 
valid results which could be readily interpreted, than 
was possible in the present study. 
There has not been time to make any hearing-read- 
ing experiments with the standard silent reading 
scales now in use, but apparently this might yield 
valuable results. The instructions or stories of the 
different scales might be read aloud by the examiner, 
and the children asked to listen, in order to repro- 
duce, answer questions, or obey orders, according to 
what the tests call for. While theresults of the present 
experiments are too few on which to base valid con- 
clusions, there is some reason to expect that for most 
readers lower scores will be made when the material 
is read aloud to them than when they read it them- 
selves. This hearing score seems to be progressively 
lower as the material includes non-reading difficul- 
ties such as puzzles, catches, mathematics, abstract 
reasoning, memory tests, and the like. The less the 
selections measure pure reading ability, the lower the 
hearing score seems to be. 
The oral use of silent reading scales also suggests a 
method for individual diagnosis. If the hearing score 
of a pupil is exceptionally low as compared with that 
of other children with the same amounts of training, 
it may indicate that the pupil’s difficulty is not pri- 
4 49
-P-A-G-E-50
  marily that of reading, but has to do perhaps with 
unfamiliarity with English, inability to pay atten- 
tion, poor memory, deficient vocabulary, and the like. 
The experiments briefly reported here showed that, 
when no time limit is set for silent reading, pupils 
having high scores in the hearing test do even better 
in the reading test, but pupils with low scores in the 
hearing test seem to follow no particular rule as to 
their achievements in reading. There was a wider 
distribution in the silent reading scores than in the 
hearing scores. 
Scauzs oF Increasine DirricuLty 
The original hearing-reading scales were divided into 
20 steps of steadily increasing difficulty. Thought, 
style, memory span, and task were all maintained at 
a constant level, and the vocabulary was carefully 
varied. After the hearing-reading plan had been laid 
aside, the attempt was made to use these scales as 
measures of reading difficulty. 
A preliminary question had already been raised as 
to whether vocabulary difficulty could properly be 
increased beyond a moderate level, since, in construct- 
ing the paragraphs it had been found that it is prac- 
tically impossible to maintain a level of natural 
unstilted English prose while at the same time using 
harder and harder words. Hard words are not used 
in ordinary writing; and their introduction at once 
tends to make the writing artificial. Normal English 
consists of words so simple that the ordinary adult 
does not have to look them up in the dictionary. 
50
-P-A-G-E-51
  
The two sets of 20 paragraphs of increasing vocab- 
ulary difficulties were given as straight difficulty tests 
to a large number of children. No time limit was set, 
other than that of the ordinary classroom period, and 
it was assumed that the children starting at the be- 
ginning of the test with the easiest paragraph would 
work their way through harder and harder para- 
graphs until the words became so long and difficult 
that the children would not be able to understand 
what they meant. It was expected that the hardest 
paragraph a child could succeed in doing would mark 
the upper limit of his ability. 
What the experiments disclosed was that, if the 
thought is simple and the style is simple, hard words 
will not usually prevent children from getting the gist 
of a paragraph. They merely increase the amount of 
time required. When children meet hard words they 
jump them; grasp the easy words which they do 
understand; and with the easy words as key words, 
piece out the meaning of the others. The result was 
that when these scales of increasing vocabulary diffi- 
culty were tried out in the classroom, and no time 
limit was set, there were practically no low marks. 
Even in the third grade most of the children made 
perfect or high scores. The children probably varied 
greatly in reading ability, but there was little varia- 
tion in their scores. 
The experiment was then tried of setting a time 
limit. The children were allowed to work for five 
minutes, and it was desired to find how high they 
could go in that time. The distributions of scores 
51
-P-A-G-E-52
  under this new method were more satisfactory, in 
that they were widely distributed between 0 and 20. 
Close observation of children taking the test, how- 
ever, disclosed the fact that they were working at 
markedly different rates of speed. Some children 
read as fast as they could, skipped some paragraphs 
entirely, half-read others, but made at least an at- 
tempt on every one of the 20 paragraphs before the 
five minutes were up. Other children worked fast 
until they came to a problem which puzzled them, 
and spent the remainder of the period unsuccessfully 
trying to solve it. Still other children, working at 
much slower rates of speed, succeeded in doing every 
problem they reached, and showed clear evidence of 
being able to keep on ascending when they were sud- 
denly cut short. It was clear to the examiners that 
the scores of these children were not truly comparable, 
since ability to do difficult work and ability to work 
fast were indiscriminately mixed. 
These experiments led the examiners to believe 
that in devising scales for difficulty, special consider- 
ation must be given to the element of time. If the 
test is to be given without a time limit, evidence must, 
be presented to prove that the amount of time al- 
lowed has no effect upon the score. If time is found 
to be an important controlling factor, a definite time 
limit must be set, or a definite record of each pupil’s 
rate of working must be made, not for the test as a 
whole, but for each separate level of difficulty within 
the test. 
52
-P-A-G-E-53
  Two Continuous NARRATIVE SCALES 
Two Continuous Narrative scales, CN-1 and CN-2, 
were prepared on a different plan from any of the 
others. Each scale consisted of a short and interest- 
ing story which was divided into 20 sections of equal 
length and equal difficulty. These sections were then 
so arranged that the location of each one could only 
be found by reading the section preceding it. The 
child was allowed to read for five minutes. 
Scale CN-1, like the other scales of this series, was 
a single sheet of paper 11 inches wide and 19 inches 
long. The sheet contained five columns. Each col- 
umn was divided into four sections, and in each of 
these sections there were a picture and a paragraph 
about the picture. The whole 20 paragraphs told the 
story of how a little Prince learned to like books. 
This story did not run consecutively from paragraph 
to paragraph, but instead the paragraphs were scat- 
tered among the different sections, and each, while 
carrying the child one step forward in the plot, told 
him how to find the new paragraph where he could 
read what happened next. The material printed be- 
low gives the first three paragraphs of the story in the 
order in which they came if read correctly by the 
child. 
Tur Princn’s Book 
Once upon a time there was a lazy little Prince. He 
knew how to read, but he did not like to do it. His 
Father the King was naturally very much worried, 
and finally he called Pen and Paper to help him. 
“They will know how to make my little son like 
books,” he thought, and he sent a messenger to call 
them. Now Pen and Paper were the first people who 
53
-P-A-G-E-54
tried to help the Prince to like books, so you must 
find their picture, which is just below this, and write 
a figure 1 beside it with your pencil. Then go on 
reading to learn what they said to the King. 
“The Prince will like books,” said Pen and Paper, 
“if we write one for him.” ‘Write it, and send it by 
the Postman,” said the King. As the Postman was 
the second person to help with the Prince’s book find 
his picture in the last column and write 2 beside it. 
nen go on reading to learn what he did about the 
ook. 
“Dear me!” said the Postman, “This is a heavy 
book. It is full of stories for the little Prince. I must 
run to the castle and give it to him.” If you will 
look in the third column you will find a picture of the 
Prince reading his book, and as the book was the 
third one to help him, write 3 beside it, and read 
what happened next. 
Scale CN-2 was on exactly the same general plan 
asCN-1. Inthis case, however, there was one-seventh 
more material in each paragraph, and the thought 
was somewhat harder. The full text of both contin- 
uous narrative scales is given in the appendix. It 
will be noted that in the Continuous Narrative scales 
the paragraphs uniformly carry two instruction 
thoughts apiece. One of these tells the child where 
to find the paragraph that follows in the sequence of 
the story. The other tells him what number he is to 
write beside the picture of the paragraph when he 
has located it. Classroom experimentation seems to 
show that to the child these numbers are a necessary 
partofthestory. InCN-1hewritesthem downinorder 
to keep track of how many people helped in teaching 
the little Prince to like books, and in CN-2 he is 
asked to number the piecesof evidence in the order in 
54
-P-A-G-E-55
which they were presented at the government trial 
where John testified against the band of spies. The 
children do not know it, but the fact is that in each 
scale these numbers run from 1 to 20 and indicate 
how many paragraphs the child has read up to that 
point. The result is that the child leaves a record 
behind him which tells the teacher where he went and 
what he did. If he has read and marked the story 
correctly, the highest number written is his score on 
the test. The test can be correctly scored almost as 
fast as the teacher is able to look down the columns. 
Scales CN-1 and CN-2 have been tested in all 
grades from the second through the eighth, and the 
records compared with those made by the same chil- 
dren on PS-1. In general it may be said that the nar- 
rative scales requirea lessexactly careful type of read- 
ing than do the picture supplement scales. Pupils 
make far more diversified scores with the narrative 
scales, and, in general, higher ones. Apparently the 
two types of scales measure products which differ 
considerably from each other. 
The Continuous Narrative scale, as exemplified by 
CN-1 and CN-2, was laid aside in the present exper- 
iments because it seemed to present more problems, 
and to measure a type of reading somewhat less im- 
portant for classroom use than did the Picture 
Supplement scales. The continuous narrative, how- 
ever, seems to be a device which is capable of devel- 
opment into a valuableinstrument formeasuring read- 
ing. The essentials for making such a scale are, first, 
to procure a large number of pictures from which 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  to select a complete set of illustrations which may be 
combined into an interesting and exciting narrative, 
and which are sufficiently different so that a descrip- 
tion of one will not be mistaken for that of another. 
The other requirements are ample time for writing, 
experimenting, and re-writing, funds for printing 
large numbers of trial copies for experimental pur- 
poses, and generous amounts of care and patience. 
A Drrricutt Picture SuPPLEMENT SCALE 
At the same time that PS-1 was being constructed 
a companion scale was prepared for testing in the 
same way at a somewhat higher level of vocabulary 
difficulty. The following paragraph is typical of 
those used: 
“To shake the poise of this unpleasantly supercilious 
butler outline a large boulder immediately in his 
course. This will almost inevitably cause him to 
stumble and be precipitated headlong; but in order 
to insure his demoralization draw still another a short 
distance further in front of him.” 
In making this scale it was found that slight increases 
in word length had very little effect upon the pupil’s 
ability to get the meaning quickly. When consider- 
ably longer words were introduced the difficulty was 
increased, but thematerial became stilted and unnatu- 
ral, so that care had to beexercised to prevent the par- 
agraphs from becoming a type of English which was 
not truly representative of the ordinary ‘material 
which people are called upon to read. The Difficult 
Picture Supplement scale has been tested in all 
grades from the third through the eighth, and when 
56
-P-A-G-E-57
  taken by the same children it was found to be con- 
siderably more difficult than PS-1, CN-1, or CN-2. 
PrincipLes INVOLVED 
In the course of the investigation which led to the 
production of the new scale, Picture Supplement 
Seale 1, several principles were recognized which ap- 
parently are fundamental to the construction of 
scales for measuring ability in silent reading. The 
five following chapters will be devoted to considering 
the nature of these fundamental governing principles, 
how they operate, and what is involved in applying 
them to the measurement of reading. The first of 
these principles is that discussed in Chapter IV, 
which deals with the Law of the Single Variable. 
SUMMARY 
1. In the course of the investigations recorded in this 
book, six different scales for measuring silent reading 
have been completed, printed, and tried out in 23 
school systems. The experimental copies used in this 
way have been more than 10,000 in number. 
2. Of these six scales, two have been designated 
Hearing-Reading Scales; two others Continuous Nar- 
rative Scales, and the remaining two Picture Supple- 
ment Scales. 
3. The Hearing-Reading scales are so devised that 
the child, in marking one side of the scale, is following 
instructions which he hears from the lips of the 
teacher, while in marking the other side of the scale 
he is following instructions which he reads. 
57
-P-A-G-E-58
  4. The Continuous Narrative scales are ones in 
which the child numbers, as he reads them, the con- 
secutive paragraphs of a story. These paragraphs 
are scattered about on the page, and in order to find 
them he must fully understand what he reads. 
5. The Picture Supplement scales consist of pic- 
tures and paragraphs so arranged that the pupil draws 
with his pencil a line or lines to supplement the pic- 
ture. His ability to do this in accordance with the 
printed instructions reflects the rapidity and accu- 
racy with which he can read. 
6. The scale chosen for full development in con- 
nection with the present study is one of the Picture 
Supplement scales, which has been given the office 
designation of PS-1. 
7. In the course of the investigation here des- 
cribed, several principles were recognized as funda- 
mental to the measurement of silent reading. These 
principles will be discussed in the five following chap- 
ters. The first principle to be considered is treated 
in Chapter IV under the heading, “The Law of the 
Single Variable.”’ 
58
-P-A-G-E-59
  
CHAPTER IV 
THE LAW OF THE SINGLE VARIABLE 
In the ordinary classroom test in arithmetic, the chil- 
dren are given an examination consisting of ten prob- 
lems. At the end of the period, the papers are cor- 
rected and marked. A pupil who has done the first 
three examples correctly is given a mark of 30; one 
who has six right is given a mark of 60; and the 
bright pupil who correctly solved all the problems 
before the end of the period receives a mark of 100. 
Such marks are ordinarily accepted by school 
people at their face value as measuring the relative 
accomplishments of the pupils. The mark of 60 is 
taken as representing twice as good a performance as 
that of 30, and the one of 100 is accepted as being 
twice as good as one of 50. In recent years the newer 
scientific movement in education has produced evi- 
dence showing that such marks as these cannot be 
accepted as trustworthy measures of the relative 
abilities and achievements of the pupils, and indeed 
that they are often seriously deceptive. 
The reason why the marks received by the pupils 
in the arithmetic test usually do not accurately re- 
cord their abilities and the value of their achieve- 
ments is that they do not measure different amounts 
59
-P-A-G-E-60
  of the same thing. In the first place, the different 
examples in such a test are frequently of widely vary- 
ing difficulty so that it may well be that the pupil who 
got only three right may have had almost as much 
arithmetical skill as the one who got six correct. If he 
had had a little more time, after having solved the 
third example, he might perhaps have done five or 
six correctly by the end of the period. 
Again, the mark of 100 does not correctly reflect 
the skill of the brightest pupil, as compared with the 
others, for he finished before the end of the period and 
is penalized because there was no more material for 
him to work on. If there had been, he might have 
finished 13 or 14 examples. 
A further shortcoming of such a test is found in the 
fact that the work of the pupils was not only on ma- 
terial of varying degrees of difficulty and worked on 
for different amounts of time, but the quality of work 
done by the pupils was at different levels of excel- 
lence. Some worked much more neatly than others 
and arranged their material more intelligently. Some 
missed the correct answers because of minute errors, 
such as slips in copying, while others submitted ans- 
wers that were not only incorrect but absurd and 
obviously impossible. 
The marks resulting from such a test are crude 
measures of the accomplishments resulting from un- 
dertaking tasks composed of units of differing de- 
grees of difficulty, worked at for varying amounts of 
time, and producing solutions, or attempts at solu- 
tions, of varying degrees of quality. The marks do 
60
-P-A-G-E-61
  
not measure amounts of any one thing. They mea- 
sure conglomerates composed of achievements condi- 
tioned by the three factors of quality of product, 
difficulty of task, and time consumed. 
ConsISTENCY 
It is to remedy these shortcomings of our marking 
systems that the scientific movement in education 
has devised its tests and scales. These measuring 
instruments apply to classroom processes and prod- 
ucts the fundamental law of physical measurement 
which is that the thing to be measured must possess 
the quality of consistency. It must remain constant 
while it is being measured. This is a fundamental 
necessity for logical thinking about measuring, count- 
ing, orenumerating. The things counted must all be 
of the same category. The thing measured must 
be constant in its character or composition so that 
one unit of it will be equal to any other unit of it. 
Tue SIncLE VARIABLE 
The process by which the essential characteristic of 
consistency is obtained in educational measurements 
is the one used in physical measurements. It con- 
sists of distinguishing the possible controlling, vary- 
ing factors; devising means for holding them all con- 
stant save one; and measuring that one. This is the 
law of the single variable. 
The importance of the law is readily seen in the 
measurement of handwriting. Any close comparison 
61
-P-A-G-E-62
of the merit of achievement must be in terms of only 
one variable, which, in this case, will be the quality 
of handwriting. If the handwriting of one pupil is to 
be considered as representing a more meritorious per- 
formance than that of another pupil, it must be 
shown that the material written was the same in both 
cases, that it was written under the same external 
conditions, that the material was equally familiar to 
both children, that they both wrote for the same 
amount of time, and succeeded in writing the same 
amount of material within that time. If, under these 
conditions, the quality of one handwriting is better 
than that of the other, it may truly be said that one 
represents a better achievement than the other. 
Tue Courtis Tests In ARITHMETIC 
The fundamental difference in method between the 
non-scientific test which undertakes to measure an 
uncontrolled composite of different variables, and 
the scientific test which carefully restricts its measur- 
ing to a single variable, while holding the others con- 
stant, is best illustrated by citing the arithmetic tests 
devised by Mr. Stuart A. Courtis, of Detroit. This 
pioneer student of educational measurement early 
recognized that in testing children for arithmetical 
ability several different factors would exercise a con- 
trolling influence on the results, unless special pains 
were taken to restrict the measurement to one factor 
among them, while holding the others constant. 
He did this by devising a form of test consisting of 
a large number of problems of the same sort and of 
62 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  equal difficulty, printed on prepared sheets. All of 
the children of a class begin to work at the test simul- 
taneously, and continue for exactly the same period 
of time. The test contains more examples than any 
of them can complete within the time limit. The re- 
sulting scores measure the comparative abilities of 
the children in the particular phase of number work 
that is to be tested. 
The results are trustworthy indicators of the vary- 
ing abilities of the different children, because they are 
in terms of greater or smaller amounts of the same 
thing; that is, they are in terms of units of the same 
kind within a given time limit. The conditions of the 
test are equal for all the children; the time is uniform; 
the work is held at a constant difficulty; and the ele- 
ment of quality is substantially eliminated by having 
the examples printed so that pupils have only to 
write the answers in the appropriate indicated places. 
What Mr. Courtis has done in devising his test is to 
observe scrupulously the law of the single variable. 
“OrueR Tuines Brine EquaL” 
When children first attend school and begin to study 
arithmetic the teacher impresses upon them the prin- 
ciple that they can count, add, subtract, multiply, or 
divide only in units of the same category. When 
they get a little older, they learn that measurements 
can be made only in unvarying and clearly defined 
units. A little later on, they begin to apply the law 
of the single variable to different sorts of compari- 
sons, outside of the realm of exact measurements. 
63
-P-A-G-E-64
  As a general rule, they do this without having care- 
fully formulated the law itself; they recognize the 
necessity for respecting it by saying that “other 
things being equal” such and such a result will fol- 
low. In saying this, they vaguely realize that in 
making comparisons of things where various inter- 
dependent elements enter, the other factors must be 
kept constant, and one single element measured. 
This principle has been carefully followed in de- 
vising the present test for the measurement of silent 
reading. The test has recognized the interdependent 
controlling factors, selected one as the variable, and 
contrived, in so far as possible, to keep the others con- 
stant. It has done this by keeping the difficulty of 
the task and the quality of the work as nearly con- 
stant as possible, and measuring the amount of 
achievement attained by the pupils in a given period 
of time. 
SUMMARY 
1. The traditional classroom examination consists of 
tasks of varying units of difficulty, worked at for 
varying amounts of time, and producing results of 
varying degrees of quality. The examination mark 
does not measure any one thing. It measures a con- 
glomerate of achievements conditioned by the three 
factors of quality of product, difficulty of task, and 
time consumed. 
2. It is a fundamental law of measurement that 
the thing being measured must be consistent in char- 
acter or composition so that each unit of it will be 
equal to every other unit.

3. This essential characteristic of consistency may 
be obtained in educational measurements by distin- 
guishing the possible controlling varying factors, de- 
vising means for holding all of them constant save 
one, and measuring that one. This is the law of the 
single variable. 
4. The application of this law is well illustrated by 
the work of Mr. Stuart A. Courtis of Detroit, in the 
measurement of ability in arithmetic. In the Courtis 
tests, the conditions of the test are equal for all the 
children, the time is uniform, the work is held at a 
constant level of difficulty, the element of quality is 
controlled by the form in which the test is given, and 
the variable that is measured is the amount done in 
a given length of time. 
5. The law of the single variable is a principle of 
measurement taught in the earliest school years, and 
increasingly recognized in the comparative judg- 
ments of everyday life.
-P-A-G-E-66
  CHAPTER V 
THREE TYPES OF SCALES 
The law of the single variable is to the effect that in 
careful comparative measurements every controlling 
varying factor must be identified, one must be chosen 
as the variable to be measured, and all the others 
must be held constant. 
The factors which affect results of different sorts 
of testing are so numerous that no one person could 
identify them all. Even for a single case the power- 
ful controlling influences will fall in lists of 20 or 30, 
and each one of these has subdivisions within itself. 
When the attempt is made to classify them, however, 
so that all the controlling factors of one sort are 
grouped together, it will be found that no matter 
what subject is under consideration, or how many 
controlling varying factors may have been identified 
for it, each of these factors may be classified as fall- 
ing into one of three main groups. It is either a vari- 
able of quality of product, or of difficulty reached, 
or of amount done. 
MarxsmansHip, A MEASURE OF QUALITY OF 
Propvuct 
Quality, difficulty, and amount are the three vari- 
ables. One of them must always be measured; the 
66 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
other two must always be controlled. Measurements 
for these three variables may be illustrated by citing 
examples from athletic contests. The measurement 
of quality of product is illustrated by the contest in 
marksmanship. When people are shooting at tar- 
gets, the range is fixed, the targets are of uniform size 
and shape, and the centers or bull’s-eyes towards 
which the marksmen aim are equal in color and di- 
ameter. These are elements which affect the diffi- 
culty of shooting; and they are made as nearly as 
possible equal and constant for all those who shoot. 
Since each contestant is given an equal number of 
trials, the amount which he shoots is fixed. One ele- 
ment, however, is not fixed, but is allowed to vary; 
and the records of its variations form the score of 
the contest. This variable, the different degrees of 
which are noted, is the quality of the marksmanship. 
It has no definite limits of right or wrong; it ranges 
all the way from shots so wild that they are barely 
distinguishable as attempts to hit the target to shots 
which Jand exactly in the center of the bull’s-eye. 
Marksmanship is a measure of quality. 
Bowling is another measure of quality of product. 
Difficulty is kept constant by establishing standards 
for distance, surface of alley, set up of pins, and so on; 
which are uniform for all players. The amount is 
controlled by limiting the number of attempts to two; 
and the quality of the performance is measured by 
the proportion of pins knocked down in these two 
trials. 
67
-P-A-G-E-68
  Jumpine, A Measure or Dirricutty REAcHED 
The high jump, however, is not a measure of quality 
of product; it is a measure of difficulty reached. 
Quality is kept at a constant level; it is “good enough 
to clear the bar,” and that degree of quality is set as 
a passing mark which every contestant must meet if 
his performance is to score. The contestants are, as 
a rule, allowed three attempts at each height; so that 
the numbers of chances for success are equal. The 
element which is allowed to vary is the height the 
contestant can jump, and, as each height is success- 
fully cleared, another and more difficult height is set. 
This sort of contest, where quality is set, the amount, 
or number of trials is uniform, and the score marks 
the difficulty of the hardest task successfully com- 
pleted, is a measure of difficulty reached. 
Racine, A Mzasure or Time CONSUMED OR 
Amount Dong 
The third sort of athletic contest is illustrated by the 
race. In most forms of racing the quality element 
plays a minor part. There are usually two minimum 
requirements for quality. The contestant must run 
well enough to finish the course; and he must refrain 
from interfering with or fouling his competitors. 
Quality in excess of these requirements has no effect 
upon the score. The difficulty of the race is made 
equal for all the contestants, by having them cover 
the same course. With quality and difficulty held 
constant, amount done is left as the third element 
which must be treated as the variable. 
68 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
Tue ReLaTION or TIME AND AMOUNT 
The variable of amount is handled in two ways. In 
some races the contestants are allowed to ride or run 
for a definite period of time—as in the case of the 
six day bicycle race—and the resulting scores are in 
terms of the amount of ground covered. In other 
races a definite distance is set, and the scores show 
how much time was required to cover that distance. 
Time and amount are complementary terms. Time 
implies amount and amount implies time. In the 
three-fold classification of variables which can be 
measured, time and amount have been treated as one 
group, under the word ‘“‘amount,”’ because they are 
essential to each other. The question “How much 
can be done?” demands at once a statement of the 
time allowed for doing it; and the question “How 
long will it take?”’ depends upon how much there is 
todo. Time and amount must always be considered 
together. 
Shooting, jumping, and racing have been cited as 
typical examples of the three fundamental sorts of 
measurement; but it would be possible to expand 
such a list to include practically every sort of athletic 
activity in which comparative achievements are re- 
flected by carefully recorded quantitative scores. It 
will be found that nearly every careful quantitative 
measurement we make seeks to measure one of the 
three fundamental variables—quality of product, 
difficulty reached, or amount done—and in order to 
measure that one variable, seeks to control the other 
two. 
69
-P-A-G-E-70
  THREE Types oF SCALES 
When the classroom teacher wishes to judge the 
work of one of her pupils, she asks herself three ques- 
tions about him. She wants to know “How well can 
he do?” “How hard work can he do?” and ‘‘How 
fast can he do it?” and the answers to her three ques- 
tions furnish the basis on which she decides whether 
to keep him, to promote him, or to send him back to 
the grade below. 
These three questions, how well, how hard, how 
fast, represent the teacher’s attempts to measure the 
three fundamental factors of quality, difficulty, and 
time or amount. The educational tests and scales 
which have been devised during the past ten years 
are attempts to help her answer those questions; and 
each of them seeks to measure some one of those 
same three fundamental factors. While the principle 
of the single variable has not always been fully un- 
derstood or closely followed, in general it may be 
said that the standard educational measurements 
fall into three clearly defined groups, according to 
which of the three fundamental factors they have 
chosen as the variable they seek to measure. They 
are tests and scales for quality of product, for diffi- 
culty reached, and for amount done. Moreover, it 
is probably true that new scales as they are developed 
in the future must inevitably belong to one of these 
three groups; and the student of educational mea- 
surement who plans to devise a scale must seriously 
consider which of the three variables he will attempt 
70
-P-A-G-E-71
to measure, and which of the three types of scales 
the one he presents must therefore be. 
SuMMARY 
1. The innumerable factors which influence the re- 
sults of testing may be classified into three distinct 
fundamental groups. They are variables of quality, 
of difficulty, or of amount. 
2. The measurement of quality is illustrated by 
contests in marksmanship or in bowling. In these 
contests the difficulty of task and the time allowed 
for doing it are maintained as constants, and the vari- 
able measured is the quality of the performance. 
3. The measure for difficulty is seen in the high 
jump. There quality and time are constants, and the 
variable is the difficulty of the hardest task success- 
fully done. 
4. The measure for amount is seen in the race, 
where quality is but slightly operative, difficulty is 
constant, and the variable measured is either the 
amount done in a given time, or the time required to 
do a given amount. 
5. Time and amount are complementary terms, 
each of which depends for its meaning upon the other. 
In the threefold classification of variables, the term 
amount is to be considered as carrying with it its 
companion term time. 
6. Educational measurements are attempts to 
answer the three fundamental classroom questions: 
“Flow well can he do?” ‘‘ How hard work can he do?”’ 
and “‘How fast can he do it?” Each seeks to mea- 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
sure one of the three fundamental factors, and, 
according to which it selects, it may be classified as a 
test or scale for quality, for difficulty, or for amount. 
7. The student of educational measurement who 
plans to devise a scale for ability in any school sub- 
ject must consider, first, which of the three variables 
he will attempt to measure; and second, having 
chosen that variable and thereby fixed the type of 
scale which must be employed, what are the impli- 
cations as to the methods he must follow. 
72
-P-A-G-E-73
CHAPTER VI 
SCALES FOR QUALITY OF PRODUCT 
There is a group of school subjects in which the ordi- 
nary classroom work results in tangible recorded prod- 
ucts of varying qualities. Among such products are 
handwriting, freehand lettering for mechanical draw- 
ing, drawing, and, less definitely, English composi- 
tion. In these subjects the question the teacher asks 
is “How well can the child do?” and the measuring 
device which must be used to answer her question is 
that of the scale for quality of product. 
From the point of view of educational measure- 
ment the outstanding characteristic of handwriting 
is that the thing itself is there to be measured and 
that it exists in samples of differing degrees of quality. 
Some of the handwritings are poor, when the ages 
and grades of the children are taken into account, 
while others are fairly good, and still others may be 
considered excellent. The problem of the measurer 
is to gage or determine the relative degree of goodness 
of the actual sample lying on the table before him. 
The sample itself has physical properties. If the 
writing were perfect its lines and letters would be 
regular, its slants uniform, and its spacing equal. In 
proportion as the symbols on the paper depart from 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  these known standards, the goodness of the writing 
is diminished. These diminutions, moreover, take 
place by infinite varieties of combinations and per- 
mutations in a perfectly continuous series down to 
the point where the writing is so bad as hardly to be 
handwriting at all. There is no right or wrong in the 
quality of handwriting. It simply ranges from less 
good to more good through a continuous series of 
degrees of quality. 
The same observations may be made with respect 
to freehand lettering. Here again the product is 
tangible and objective, and the quality of a given 
sample may be gaged by its deviations from those 
set characteristics which would constitute a perfect 
sample of the sort of lettering in question. 
With a less degree of definiteness similar comments 
may be made with regard to samples of drawing. 
The products of work in manual training have the 
same characteristics and belong in this same group 
from the viewpoint of the measurer. Still another 
type of product in this group is that of composition. 
As in the case of the handwriting, lettering, and 
drawing, the actual product is available for exami- 
nation and comparison. Moreover, the samples exist 
in varying degrees of quality which range from poor 
to good in unbroken series. 
The classroom products that have been considered, 
writing, lettering, drawing, and composition, are 
measurable by scales for quality. Their common 
characteristics make it possible to construct such 
scales, and in the case of each of them, there are in 
74
-P-A-G-E-75
existence educational measuring instruments of the 
quality type which have demonstrated their value 
and validity. 
Measuring scales for quality of product were the 
first type to be developed. The reason for this is 
that the pioneer students, entering a field that at best 
presented serious obstacles, undertook at the outset 
the measurement of products that existed in the shape 
of tangible records that could be examined and com- 
pared as many times and by as many methods as 
might be necessary. 
In the modern movement not only was the first 
scale one devised by Professor E. L. Thorndike, for 
measuring quality of handwriting, but other quality 
scales for lettering, drawing, and composition fol- 
lowed shortly. Again, it was Professor Thorndike 
who developed the first scale for the measurement of 
drawing, and published it in 1913.1 During the same 
year, Dr. H. O. Rugg developed his scale for the 
measurement of freehand lettering which he pub- 
lished two years later.2. The pioneer work in the 
measurement of quality in English composition was 
produced even earlier, and published by Dr. Milo B. 
Hillegas in 1912.8

  Time and Dirricutty CoNTROLLED 
In the scales under discussion, quality is chosen as 
the variable which is to be measured. In accordance 
with the law of the single variable, then, the remain- 
ing two factors of difficulty and amount, with all 
their numerous subsidiary elements, must either be 
excluded from the test or so rigidly controlled that 
they are restrained from influencing the results. 
What this means in the case of scales for quality of 
handwriting has already been touched upon in Chap- 
ter IV, in the discussion of the law of the single vari- 
able. It was pointed out that accurate comparisons 
between the achievements of children in handwriting 
can be made only where the writing has been pro- 
duced under certain carefully controlled conditions. 
The testing must take place under similar external 
conditions of seating, lighting, and so on. Children 
must be furnished with equally good writing imple- 
ments. The material to be written must be the same 
for all the children, and equally familiar to all of 
them. They must write for the same length of time; 
and must have finished equal amounts within that 
time. If it can be shown that these conditions have 
been met, comparisons between the qualities of the 
samples of handwriting produced under them can be 
regarded as true comparisons of achievement; for the 
comparisons based on quality are then unadulterated 
by intruding factors of difficulty or time. 
Similar observations may be made for any subject 
in which the quality of the product is to be measured. 
76
-P-A-G-E-77
  When quality is chosen as the variable, every remain- 
ing factor which contributes to the difficulty of test 
or the time required to take it, must be identified; 
and, having been identified, must either be excluded 
or controlled.

QUALITY 
Reading is a classroom activity which does not read- 
ily lend itself to measurement by means of scales of 
quality. One reason for this is that it does not result 
in a tangible objective product which can be scrutin- 
ized and measured. Another reason is that quality 
in reading is an elusive thing which varies not only 
with different people but with the same person from 
moment to moment as he reads. Dr. C. T. Gray re- 
cords, in his monograph on Types of Reading Abil- 
ity,' experiments in studying breathing and percep- 
tion span in oral reading by having the subject read 
aloud into the receiver of a dictaphone. The wax 
records thus made served as the basis for close an- 
alytical study. It might be feasible to use a similar 
device in securing records of oral reading for the pur- 
pose of measuring expression, pronunciation, and 
emphasis; but the great difficulties in procedure of 
this sort of testing prevent its use for the present in 
public schools. 
There is more reason, perhaps, to wish for some

  method of measuring the richness of mental imagery, 
the variety of neurone connections, which are stimu- 
lated by the printed page. The reason that such 
qualitative measurements cannot easily be made is 
that there are as many different things which chil- 
dren get out of reading as there are children and as 
there are times that children read. Because of the 
infinite combinations of neurone connections in differ- 
ent minds the reading process awakens in conscious- 
ness thoughts and memories of the most varied char- 
acter. In re-reading even a simple passage the same 
individual gets new meanings from the page, new and 
different mental reactions from the same stimuli. 
Moreover, outside of the psychologist’s labora- 
tory the shades of quality of reading are not of great 
import. For practical purposes the problem of mea- 
suring reading involves finding out how rapidly the 
subject reads the material with a sufficient degree of 
comprehension to get from it the essentials of its 
meaning. As the material increases in difficulty the 
ability to read it is rarer; but the important question 
is not ‘‘ How full and varied is the meaning the reader 
draws from it?” but rather “Is he able to grasp the 
gist of the material?” The quality element is re- 
duced to the very simple one of ‘ Well enough to get 
the essential thought.” 
SUMMARY 
1. Ability in such subjects as writing, drawing, and 
composition, in which the products are tangible rec- 
78
-P-A-G-E-79
ords of varying degrees of quality, is best measured 
by scales for quality of product. 
2. The first of the modern scales for measuring 
classroom products was Professor Edward L. Thorn- 
dike’s scale for measuring the quality of handwriting. 
This was a scale for quality of product. 
3. Other scales for quality of product quickly fol- 
lowed. Among these were Dr. Rugg’s scale for mea- 
suring freehand lettering in mechanical drawing, Dr. 
Thorndike’s scale for measuring the quality of chil- 
dren’s drawing, and Dr. Hillegas’ scale for the mea- 
surement of quality in English composition. 
4. Scales for quality of product select quality as 
the variable which is to be measured. In accordance 
with the law of the single variable, they must rigidly 
control the two remaining variables of difficulty and 
amount, and their subsidiary elements, in order that 
these variables may be prevented from influencing 
the results. 
5. Reading does not readily lend itself to measure- 
ment by scales for quality of product. One reason 
for this is that it does not directly result in a tangible 
objective product of such a nature that its goodness 
or quality can be measured. Another reason is that 
for practical purposes the problem of measuring read- 
ing is to discover not what rich and varied meanings 
the subject draws from the printed page, but rather, 
how rapidily he can read the material with a suffi- 
cient degree of comprehension to get from it the 
essentials of its meaning. :

  CHAPTER VII 
SCALES FOR DIFFICULTY REACHED 
There is another group of school subjects in which 
the tangible records are fundamentally different from 
those considered in the last chapter, in that they are 
not expressed in varying degrees of quality from 
worst to best. They are school subjects of such a 
nature that what the pupil does is either right or 
wrong. Foremost among such subjects are spelling 
and arithmetic, and in the same class with them, but 
with less definiteness, are geography, history, and 
grammar. These are informational subjects and, by 
the common verdict of society, the information is 
only valuable if it is accurate and correct. A type 
of handwriting that is somewhat inferior to another 
sample may be of almost equal practical value. The 
same cannot be said of spelling, arithmetic, history, 
geography, or grammar. Classroom products in 
these subjects are not judged by better and worse; 
they are judged by right and wrong; and, because of 
this fundamental characteristic, they are measured 
by types of tests and scales different from those that 
have already been considered. 
In spelling, the teacher wishes to know “‘ How hard 
words can the child spell correctly?’’; in arithmetic, 
80
-P-A-G-E-81
“How hard problems can he do?”; in history, or 
geography, or grammar, “How hard questions can 
he answer?” The commonest of all classroom ques- 
tions is probably that which relates to the difficulty 
of the work which the child can do correctly. The 
usual method which has been adopted to answer 
that question is to prepare a series of tasks carefully 
graded in difficulty. Those near the beginning of the 
series are so easy that almost any child in the group 
can do them successfully; as the series progresses, 
the tasks become increasingly harder; and near the 
end of the series they have become so hard that al- 
most no child in the group can do them. In taking 
the test, the children start at the beginning and work 
as far as they can. The hardest task successfully 
completed is taken to measure the degree of accom- 
plishment shown. 
Such a test is like a series of hurdles of increasing 
height, and the object is to discover how high a 
hurdle the individual being tested can clear. He is 
given as much time as may be necessary to demon- 
strate where his limit is. Such tests have the virtues 
of ease of administration and simplicity of interpreta- 
tion. Their validity depends upon whether or not 
the ability being tested really does function with 
relative independence from the time taken. 
Tue Time ELEMent IN ScauEs For DirFicuLTy 
In scales for difficulty, the variable which is measured 
is the difficulty of the work which the child can do. 
The difficulty of each successive task is carefully in- 
6 81
-P-A-G-E-82
  creased and controlled; and the child is allowed to 
overcome it if he can. The quality of his work must 
be high enough to be considered as ‘‘right.”” Quality 
is the passing mark of classroom practice. 
Ideally, the scale for difficulty is reserved for the 
measurement of ability in subjects where the amount 
of time has no effect upon the score. The indepen- 
dence of time, however, must hold not only for the 
most difficult problems near the end of the series, but 
for the easy problems as well; so that on whatever 
task the child is working, he can answer correctly at 
once or not at all. Conditions must be such that an 
extra allowance of time to think about the problem 
will not help him. 
Probably the nearest approach to such a situation 
among the classroom subjects is that found in the 
case of spelling. In spelling, the child can write the 
word correctly, or he cannot. If he does not know 
what the correct spelling is, there is no way for him 
to stimulate his memory; and there are few rules to 
help him. The time element in spelling is easily con- 
trolled by dictating the words at regular intervals; 
but such time control is less essential for spelling 
scales than for scales in almost any other school sub- 
ject. 
In arithmetic, on the other hand, the time element 
is especially important. Most children who are old 
enough to be subjects for testing in the operations of 
arithmetic are acquainted with its processes, but 
possess most varying degrees of skill in applying 
them. Many will fail on a short time arithmetic test, 
82
-P-A-G-E-83
who, if given unlimited time in which to count, ver- 
ify, and prove, could ultimately make high scores for 
their work. In geography, history, and grammar, 
the same rule holds true. Pupils who are doing poor 
work in the classroom are frequently able, if given 
unlimited time in which to verify, review, and at- 
tempt to remember, to make high scores in a diffi- 
culty test. 
The student who devises a scale for difficulty, 
then, must either present evidence to show that 
scores for the particular ability he seeks to measure 
are not affected by differences in time; or he must de- 
vise methods by which the amount of time the 
pupil is allowed to spend on each task within the 
series may be controlled or recorded. 
A common method of handling the time element 
in tests for difficulty has been to start the children 
simultaneously, and allow them to work as far 
through the series as they can, at whatever rates 
they wish, until, at the end of set period, usually five 
or ten minutes, they are told to stop. The task which 
each one has reached and finished correctly when the 
signal to stop is given is assumed to be the hardest 
he can do. The assumption is, regardless of the accu- 
racy of his work up to that point, that had he been 
allowed to continue he would have failed on every 
task above it. Such an assumption cannot properly 
be made; for the rates at which children work are not 
directly proportional to their accuracy. The scores 
which result from such testing represent genuine 
difficulty scores for some children, rate scores for 
83  
-P-A-G-E-84
  other children, and varying combinations of difficulty, 
rate, and quality, for still others. They are not com- 
parable, because they do not measure achievements 
of a single kind. They are conglomerate scores of 
difficulty, quality, and amount, in unknown and 
varying proportions. They do not conform to the 
principle of the single variable. 
Difficulty tests have been devised, in which time 
is controlled or rate recorded for every child at every 
step. The scores of such testing are comparable, for 
it is then possible to say, ‘‘Of two children who work 
at the same rate, one is able to do harder work than 
the other,” or “Of two children able to do equally 
difficult work, one is able to work faster than the 
other.” Such scores may be valid and valuable; but 
the tests necessary to secure them are so difficult of 
administration that they are not readily adapted to 
classroom practice. 
Reaping Not Measurep By SCALES FOR 
DiIFFIcULTY 
In the studies and experiments made in connection 
with the present attempts to develop new scales for 
measuring reading, much labor was devoted to mak- 
ing a reading scale in which the progressive steps con- 
sisted of paragraphs of increasingly longer and more 
unusual words. This was a test of the hurdle type, 
in which the increasing difficulties in reading con- 
sisted of constantly greater difficulties of vocabulary. 
The difficulties of thought, and the types of response, 
84
-P-A-G-E-85
  
required by the instructions contained in the progres- 
sive paragraphs, were kept at a constant level. 
The attempt to make a practicable working in- 
strument of this scale failed, and had to be abandoned, 
because it was found that the time consumed, and 
the difficulty of the task that could be successfully 
completed, were interdependent variables. If the 
children were given sufficient time, they were able to 
follow instructions couched in the most recondite and 
unusual phraseology. The only way to make the 
hurdles high enough was to introduce complexities 
of thought and difficulties of task, which tended to 
make the test one for qualities other than ordinary 
reading ability. 
Because the test as it stood resulted in nearly un- 
distributed high scores, which could not be taken to 
represent the varying abilities of the children, experi- 
ments were tried in setting a single time limit of five 
minutes, and seeing which children could reach the 
highest difficulty in that time. Observation of the 
children taking the test, and analysis of the resulting 
scores, showed that the last paragraph read correctly 
within the time allowed represented for some children 
the most difficult material they could read, when 
they had been able to read everything before it cor- 
rectly. For other children, the latest paragraph read 
correctly might or might not be taken as the limit of 
their ability, since they had failed on some of the 
easier paragraphs below it, and might fail or succeed 
with apparently equal likelihood onsome of the harder 
paragraphs above. The scores of still other children 
85  
-P-A-G-E-86
  were clearly measures not of difficulty but of the 
rates at which they read, and there was ample evi- 
dence that had more time been given, they would 
have been able to read successfully material much 
harder than any they were allowed to try. 
It was evident that comparable scores in silent 
reading scales of the difficulty type can only be se- 
cured by controlling or recording the time spent by 
every child on every paragraph. This is readily done 
where one child is tested at a time; but the adminis- 
tration of such careful timing for large groups of 
children simultaneously tested presents difficulties 
which cannot readily be overcome. For these reasons 
the use of the difficulty scale for the measurement of 
silent reading was abandoned. 
SUMMARY 
1. There is a large and important group of school 
subjects in which quality is not expressed in varying 
terms from worst to best, but is referred to as either 
“right” or “wrong.” The tradition of society has 
established for these subjects a passing mark; and 
products or performances which fail to reach that 
mark are regarded as of no value. This group in- 
cludes such subjects as spelling, arithmetic, geog- 
raphy, history, and grammar. 
2. The commonest classroom question with regard 
to these “right and wrong” subjects is “How hard 
work can the child do correctly?” The usual device 
adopted in the attempt to answer this question is the 
test or scale for difficulty reached. 
86
-P-A-G-E-87
  3. Scales for difficulty reached consist of series of 
tasks carefully graded in difficulty from very easy to 
very hard. Children start at the beginning and 
work as far as they can. The hardest task success- 
fully completed is taken to mark the upper limit of 
the child’s ability. 
4. In scales for difficulty reached, the quality re- 
quired is the “right” of classroom tradition. Diffi- 
culty is carefully controlled and increased. The 
variable measured is the child’s ability to do work of 
different degrees of difficulty. 
5. Scales for difficulty are best devised for sub- 
jects where time is not a controlling factor. Such 
subjects are rarely found. The independence of 
achievement scores from time allowed, in any given 
subject, cannot be assumed; it must be proved; and 
the burden of proof rests upon the individual who 
devises the scale. 
6. A common method for controlling the time ele- 
ment in scales for difficulty has been to set a definite 
time allowance for testing and allow children to work 
as far through the series as they can, at whatever 
rates they wish, until the signal to stop is given. The 
task which each one has reached and finished cor- 
rectly is assumed to be the hardest he can do. This 
assumption cannot validly be made. 
7. Where time is a controlling factor, the scale for 
difficulty must be so devised that time is controlled 
or rate recorded for every child at every step. If 
this is done, and certain other conditions observed, 
the resulting scores are statistically comparable. 
87
-P-A-G-E-88
8. Reading is a subject in which the time allowed 
is of great influence on scores secured through test- 
ing. In scales for reading, the time element must 
therefore be controlled. Since the task of recording 
rate or controlling time, in a large group of children, 
for every child, at every step of a difficulty scale, pre- 
sents nearly prohibitive difficulties of administration, 
the attempt to make a difficulty scale for reading was 
abandoned.

CHAPTER VIII 
SCALES FOR AMOUNT DONE 
In spelling, time is controlled by the rate at which the 
teacher dictates the words; but in such subjects as 
geography, history, grammar, and arithmetic, the 
time factor is of greater importance and is much more 
difficult to control. Accomplishment in arithmetic 
depends so directly on the number of minutes allowed 
that the time element becomes the controlling factor 
in most scientific tests in that subject. Mr. Stuart A. 
Courtis of Detroit has devised tests in arithmetic 
that have been more widely used than any other 
standard tests in education; and so may be considered 
as embodying the most generally accepted practice in 
the measurement of accomplishment in that subject. 
The basal Courtis tests consist of series of short 
problems of a constant level of difficulty, so devised 
that each one in a given set involves a single funda- 
mental operation in arithmetic. The pupils work 
during a fixed number of minutes, and the number of 
examples attempted, and the number of these cor- 
rectly solved, furnish the measure of the degree of 
success in the test.

Cooperative Research, 82 Eliot Street, Detroit, Michigan.

-P-A-G-E-90
  Tests and scales which follow this general proced- 
ure may be classified as measures for amount done. In 
tests and scales for amount done, the quality require- 
ment is ordinarily the right or wrong passing mark 
which was discussed in the previous chapter. Diffi- 
culty is of a single type, and is maintained at a 
constant level. A definite time limit is set. The 
variable which is measured is the amount which the 
child can do correctly within the time allowed. 
It is possible to prepare a series of such scales, 
which takes the place of a scale for difficulty, and 
gives the answer to the question, ‘‘How hard work 
can the child do?”’ In such a series, quality and time 
are held constant throughout the series; but diffi- 
culty, while held constant for each scale, is increased 
at regular intervals from one scale to the next. The 
Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling, by Dr. Leon- 
ard P. Ayres, is in reality such a series of scales for 
amount.! All the words given in one test are words 
of equal difficulty, and the score which the child 
makes shows the proportion he spelled correctly. He 
is then given another set of words at the next higher 
level of difficulty, and so on, progressing from one 
test to the next until his limit has been reached. 
Instead of such a series being arranged in ascending 
steps of a single type of difficulty, it might consist 
of scales for amount, each for a different type of 
difficulty. In this case, the series would help answer 
the question, “Which processes can the child do 
1Ayres, Leonard P. Measurement of Ability in Spelling, 
Russell Sage Foundation, New York City, 1915. 
90
-P-A-G-E-91
  correctly, and on which does he fail?” The eight 
Courtis arithmetic tests are a series of this sort. 
Scales for amount done, in various forms, furnish 
the means of discovering which children should be 
warned to go more slowly, and which encouraged to 
work faster; who needs to be reproved for careless 
work, and who should be taught the difficult art of 
neglecting irrelevant details. Scales for amount, in 
carefully graded series, can answer such questions as 
“What does the child know, what can he do, and in 
what skills or knowledges is he lacking?” In fact, 
scales for amount, carefully prepared, each for a 
specific purpose, may be made the instruments for 
answering most of the questions concerning the abil- 
ities and disabilities of children, which the classroom 
teacher needs to ask. They promise to be, in the fu- 
ture, probably the most useful single instrument for 
the measurement and diagnosis of ability in class- 
room subjects. 
Reapine MEASURABLE BY SCALES FOR AMOUNT 
Don 
Reading is a subject which lends itself to measure- 
ment by scales for amount done. Scales for amount 
imply testing material in which the quality of the 
product, the difficulty of the task, and the time al- 
lowed, shall all be amenable to control at constant 
levels. For practical purposes, the problem of read- 
ing involves finding out how rapidly the subject reads 
the material with a sufficient degree of comprehen- 
sion to get from it the essentials of its meaning. The 
91
-P-A-G-E-92
    
quality demanded by everyday experience is the 
minimum quality of “good enough to get the essen- 
tial thought;”’ and this minimum requirement may 
therefore be considered as the passing mark, which 
separates success from failure. 
The control of reading difficulty involves, first, 
selecting a single type or combination of types of 
difficulty, and securing material which shall con- 
form to that selected type; and second, of preparing 
that material so that each section of it shall be of 
the same degree of difficulty as each other section. 
Equality of difficulty rests upon painstaking analy- 
sis of reading ability, recognition of the numerous 
subsidiary factors which make for success in exercis- 
ing that ability, and the invention of methods for 
eliminating such of those subsidiary factors as are 
undesirable and for controlling the remainder. 
In a reading scale for amount, the time element 
must also be controlled. This may either be done by 
setting a definite time limit, in which the children do 
as many tasks as they can; or by asking the children 
to do a certain number of tasks, and recording the 
time which each child requires to finish them. For 
classroom purposes, individual timing of children is 
difficult to administer, and its results are usually un- 
reliable. The more satisfactory method is to deter- 
mine the time allowance which will give every child 
a chance to do something, but prevent any ordinary 
child from doing everything; a time allowance, that 
is, which will result in well distributed scores, with 
neither large numbers of undistributed zero scores— 
92
-P-A-G-E-93
which would indicate a too meager time allowance— 
nor large numbers of perfect scores—which would 
indicate a too generous time allowance. What these 
proper time limits are for reading can be determined 
by careful experimentation in the classroom. 
In the light of the foregoing considerations, it was 
decided that the new scale for the measurement of 
silent reading should be a scale for amount, in which 
quality, difficulty, and time should be held constant, 
at carefully determined levels, and the variable to be 
measured should be the amount of reading the chil- 
dren could successfully do in the time allowed. 
SuMMARY 
1. Informational subjects in which time is a powerful 
controlling factor are best measured by tests and 
scales for amount done. The arithmetic tests de- 
vised by Mr. Stuart A. Courtis of Detroit are good 
examples of tests for amount done. In these tests, 
quality is held at the ‘‘correct”’ or passing mark of 
classroom tradition; difficulty is maintained of a 
single kind and at a constant level for every task 
within the scale; and a definite time limit is set. The 
variable measured is the amount the child can do 
correctly within the time allowed. 
2. Tests and scales for amount may be prepared 
singly or in series. They may be so devised as to 
furnish information concerning how hard work the 
child can do, on what process or processes he fails, 
what special knowledges he lacks, and what sorts of 
93 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  additional training he should be given. They are 
well adapted for group testing. 
3. Reading is readily measurable by tests and 
scales for amount done. In such measurement the 
quality required is reading good enough to get the 
essential thought. The difficulty of the testing ma- 
terial is confined to a single type, and is maintained 
at asingle level. A time limit is set which shall result 
in scores fairly distributed between 0 and 100; and 
the variable measured is the amount of such reading 
under such conditions that the child can do success- 
fully in the time allowed. The new scale for mea- 
suring silent reading, Picture Supplement Scale 1, is 
a scale for amount done.

  CHAPTER IX 
SCALES AND TESTS 
The scale for handwriting is a measuring instrument 
used to determine the quality of samples of penman- 
ship. It must be noted, however, that the quality of 
the writing of an individual depends in part on such 
matters as the degree of haste or care with which it 
was produced, and corresponding observations would 
be equally valid concerning lettering, drawing, or 
composition. Most people normally have several 
characteristic handwritings. Their penmanship used 
in composing a formal note will ordinarily be different 
from, and better than, their writing in personal 
memoranda quickly jotted down. In a similar way, 
the quality of lettering, or a drawing, or a com- 
position, will be in a considerable measure dependent 
on the conditions under which it was produced, and 
especially on the amount of time taken to do it. 
Moreover, if the results are to be compared in 
terms of relative merit of achievement, it must be 
shown that the persons producing them have had equal 
opportunities to learn the skills or knowledges re- 
quired. That which is exceptionally good writing or 
reading or arithmetic work for a third grade pupil 
may well be poor or mediocre work for an eighth grade 
95
-P-A-G-E-96
pupil, and that which might receive a grade of 80 or 
90 on a scale of 100 in the third grade might deserve 
rather a grade of 20 or 30 in the eighth. Because of 
these facts, valid comparisons of varying degrees of 
achievement can be made only if the individuals 
producing them are members of a single group or 
class, and have produced their writings, or other 
classroom products, under the same carefully con- 
trolled conditions. 
This is provided for by the formulation of tests to 
accompany the scales; and while the distinction has 
not been commonly recognized in educational prac- 
tice, there are two general rules with respect to scales 
and tests that may be laid down. The first of these 
is that no scale can be successfully used for compar- 
ing the merit of achievements of the members of a 
group unless the products measured are the results 
of standardized tests, uniformly administered to 
uniform groups. The second rule is the converse of 
the first. It is that the results produced by stan- 
dardized tests cannot be validly used for comparing 
the merit of achievements of the individuals in a 
group unless the comparisons are made by means of 
scales. The scale and the test go hand in hand as 
the inseparable component instruments for the ade- 
quate measurement of educational products. The 
test controls the conditions under which the products 
are produced; the scale is used to evaluate the results. 
It is believed that these two rules are valid, and of 
the first importance in indicating the steps that 
must be taken in devising a new method for measure- 
96
-P-A-G-E-97
ment in education. By derivation from the Latin, 
the test is the thing with which a sample is taken. 
It originally meant a little earthenware pot. Later 
on the term was applied to a little crucible used for 
testing the fineness of silver, and still later we find it 
used in almost its original sense as applied to the test 
tube of the laboratory. The scale, or scala, was a 
ladder, a long straight article divided into equal steps 
and readily lending itself to use as a measure. 
The scale, as used in the evaluation of educational 
products, may be thought of as a linear rule extend- 
ing from the worst to the best, from the product of 
no merit to that of greatest merit, and having indi- 
cated upon it steps or degrees by which intermediate 
achievements may be gauged. It measures in terms 
of relativity of merit, showing whether a given prod- 
uct or performance represents an achievement that 
is halfway along the scale from worst to best, or at a 
point 90 per cent of the distance from the zero point 
to the high end, or in some other definite location. 
The function of the scale is to take the score result- 
ing from the test and interpret it in terms of relative 
merit. 
The result secured from the test itself does not 
carry with it the interpretation of its value in terms of 
relative merit because relative merit can be measured 
only in terms of the whole range for the group in 
question, subdivided into units of known value, 
which preferably are equal steps. Since it is the scale 
and not the test which shows the range of merit of 
achievement, and marks the steps within that range, 
7 97
-P-A-G-E-98
  it is by means of the scale that comparisons of the 
merit of achievement of different individuals must 
be made. 
In brief review the foregoing are the principles 
underlying the rule that comparisons of merit of 
achievement in classroom subjects can be made only 
by using scales to measure products resulting from 
the use of standardized tests. The corollary of this 
tule is that every scale must be accompanied by de- 
finitely formulated procedures of testing, designed to 
secure the materials to be measured, and that the 
results of testing must be measured by scales if they 
are to be used to compare merit of achievement. 
HomocENrEovus Groups 
It will be noted that, in the foregoing discussion, one 
of the conditions laid down for insuring the validity 
of the results of measurements has been that the 
group measured should be homogeneous, in that it 
should consist of individuals of like degrees of matur- 
ity and training. This requirement is so important 
that it seems to demand special comment. In 
practice, the term “homogeneous” has to be inter- 
preted somewhat loosely, and has usually been taken 
to mean that a group tested should consist of chil- 
dren of a given school grade who are approximately 
of equal maturity and have been given about equal 
amounts of school training. It is entirely probable 
that strict adherence to this rule in the construction 
of scales would increase their value, whether they 
98
-P-A-G-E-99
  were scales for quality of product, for difficulty 
reached, or for amount done. 
Two illustrations may make clearer the need for 
keeping these distinctions in mind. The first relates 
to physical measurements, such as those showing the 
heights of male human beings. Students of anthro- 
pometry have long recognized that groups subjected 
to such measurements must be homogeneous if the 
results are to be used in careful analyses. For ex- 
ample, one would not get a normal distribution of 
returns if he measured heights of soldiers in an army, 
in which some of the divisions consisted of tall Swed- 
ish soldiers, while others had been recruited among 
the shorter peoples of southern Italy. It is still more 
important that such a group should consist entirely of 
adult men. If boys and infants were included, the 
measures might run all the way from about 15 inches 
to about 75 inches, and their distribution would not 
at all resemble the familiar bell-shaped outline which 
will always be found in such measurements for height, 
weight, or other physical characteristics if the group 
measured is homogeneous, and which has come to be 
known as “the normal surface of frequency.” 
A second illustration may be drawn from spelling, 
in which words are distributed according to the de- 
gree of success that children have in spelling them. 
Here it is important that the groups tested should be 
homogeneous with respect to maturity and degree of 
training, as it was in the case of measurement of 
height, and for reasons that are fundamentally the 
same. The range of spelling ability of second grade 
99
-P-A-G-E-100
  pupils is marked at its low end by the ability to spell 
the simplest words, such as me and do, and in its 
higher ranges by ability to spell longer words, like stop 
and turn. In the case of eighth grade children, how- 
ever, these words are not distributed along a base line 
measuring the spelling ability of the pupils, because 
they have now become of equal difficulty. The chil- 
dren can spell them all, automatically, and without 
hesitation. The words stop and turn are no harder 
than the words me and do, and since they are all of no 
difficulty, they are all of equal difficulty. 
In brief outline, these are the reasons why all 
groups to be measured must be homogeneous with 
respect to maturity and training, in so far as it is 
practically possible to obtain such homogeneity. It 
now seems probable that accepted practice in the de- 
velopment of educational measurements will increas- 
ingly recognize the importance of this principle, as it 
has long been recognized in the older fields of statis- 
tical investigation in anthropometry, biometry, and 
biology. 
TABULAR CLASSIFICATION OF TESTS AND SCALES 
In this and the preceding chapters, educational mea- 
suring instruments have been classified as tests and 
scales. Tests have been divided into three groups, 
according as they are for quality of product, difficulty 
reached, or amount done. The factors involved in 
testing have been shown to be three in number, two 
of which are kept constant, and one of which is al- 
lowed to vary, while its variations are noted. The 
100
-P-A-G-E-101
  relationships between these different instruments 
and factors will be made clearer by the tabular pre- 
sentation on page 102, which gives the classifications 
for several of the well-known tests and scales in the 
fundamental school subjects. In cases where the 
testing methods have not been fully formulated by 
the authors, the procedure tabulated is that which 
has been accepted by common practice. 
The tabulation shows that while there are many 
variations, in general the well known measuring de- 
vices conform to the fundamental principles already 
discussed. Each test makes an attempt to measure a 
single variable. Each scale is accompanied by a test, 
which is a set of more or less carefully formulated 
methods for regulating the conditions under which 
the product to be measured is produced. Wherever 
the test is accompanied by a scale, the scale in- 
terprets the test data in terms of comparative merit 
for a particular group.

  SUMMARY 
1. Two rules are formulated. The first is that com- 
parisons of merit of achievement in classroom sub- 
jects can be made only by the use of scales to measure 
products that result from the use of standardized tests. 
2. The second rule is that every scale must be ac- 
companied by definitely formulated procedures of 
testing designed to secure the materials to be mea- 
sured, and that the results of testing must be 
measured by scales if they are to be used to compare 
merit of achievement. 
3. The function of the test is to recognize the inter- 
dependent factors conditioning the results; to select 
one as the variable that is to be measured; and con- 
trive, in so far as possible, to keep all the others 
constant. 
4. One of the conditions for securing valid and 
comparable results in testing is that the groups 
measured should be homogeneous with respect to the 
subject under consideration. This principle has long 
been recognized in the older fields of statistical inves- 
tigation in anthropometry, biometry, and biology 
and it seems certain that it will be increasingly ac- 
cepted as fundamental in the development of mea- 
sures in education.

CHAPTER X 
SCORING THE RETURNS 
Through the cooperation of the superintendents, 
supervisors, and teachers of 21 cities, and two special 
schools, returns were received giving the scores made 
by children tested by Picture Supplement Scale 1 in 
25 classes in each grade from the third through the 
eighth. Approximately 30 children were tested in 
each class. The total number of returns thus secured, 
excluding such earlier returns as were secured before 
the experimental material had been revised to nearly 
its present form, was 4,493. The following list shows

To the Teacher: Please record in the spaces below 
the score made by each pupil in the silent reading 
test. The results are to be used in further modifica- 
tion of the scale, and your cooperation in the work 
is earnestly asked. Write the names of the pupils on 
the numbered lines at the bottom of this sheet. 
In recording scores, please give the number of pictures 
correctly marked, and tell which ones were wrongly 
marked and which were skipped. This isa test not of 
drawing but of reading. Mark as correct any draw- 
ing, no matter how crude, which exactly follows in- 
structions. Mark every drawing wrong which does 
not exactly follow instructions. 
Please fill also the blanks at the bottom of the sheet, 
giving your grade, school, name, etc. Comments on 
the scales, accounts of special difficulties met by the 
children, and suggestions for modification will be 
peers and may be written on the back of this 
sheet. 
Below these instructions there were blanks for enter- 
ing the name of each child, the child’s score in para- 
graphs marked right, the numbers of any paragraphs 
attempted but incorrectly marked, and lastly, the 
106
-P-A-G-E-107
  
numbers of any paragraphs skipped and not at- 
tempted. 
Equauity or DiFFicULTY OF PARAGRAPHS 
While the scale was being developed every endeavor 
was made to construct the paragraphs so that they 
should be of equal difficulty as reading material, of 
equal difficulty with respect to the instructions they 
contain, and of substantially equal requirements in 
the time necessary to read the paragraph and make 
the mark which supplements the picture accompany- 
ing the reading matter. The paragraphs as they ap- 
pear in the final edition of the scale have been sub- 
jected to repeated revisions in order to secure these 
kinds of equality. In order to test the degree of 
success resulting from these efforts careful studies 
have been made of the relation between the number 
of times that each paragraph has been attempted and 
the number of times that the instructions have been 
successfully fulfilled. 
In order to increase the significance of this inves- 
tigation the scale was printed in two different edi- 
tions. The first of these is the standard edition in 
which the pictures and paragraphs are presented in 
the order in which they have been shown in Chapter 
II. About three-fourths of the children tested used 
this scale. A second edition was also printed in 
which the same paragraphs and instructions were 
employed but in an altered or shifted order with the 
object of finding out whether the degree of success 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  among the children was conditioned by the location 
of the paragraph on the sheet. In both editions the 
first four paragraphs were left in their original loca- 
tion. In the edition having the shifted order the 
paragraphs originally numbered from five through 
12 changed places with those from 13 through 20, 
except that paragraph seven of the standard edition 
became eight in the shifted edition, and the original 
16 changed places with 15. The number of returns 
received from the testing with the paragraphs in 
standard order was 3,405, while those from the shifted 
edition numbered 1,088. 
After the test was completed, the data from the 
score sheets showing the numbers of paragraphs 
wrongly marked and the number of those skipped 
were aggregated. The results showed for the standard 
edition and for the shifted edition the entire num- 
ber of attempts for each paragraph of the test, the 
number of cases in which the paragraph was correctly 
marked, and the per cent that those correctly marked 
were of the number of attempts. Where a paragraph 
had been skipped, but other paragraphs beyond it 
had been marked, it was included as a paragraph 
attempted. The percentages resulting from these 
comparisons are presented in Table 1.

The percentages presented in Table 1 vary within 
so moderate a range that they appear to present in 
both cases evidence that the different paragraphs 
are of reasonably uniform difficulty for the children. 
In order to test more fully the relationship between 
the location of the paragraphs and their difficulty, a 
computation was made to find the coefficient of cor- 
relation between the two sets of data presented in 
Table 1. Since the coefficient of correlation is a 
statistical device which measures the degree to which 
smaller measures in one of two series of paired values 
tend to be accompanied by smaller measures in the 
second series, and the degree to which larger mea- 
109  
-P-A-G-E-110
  sures in the first tend to be accompanied by larger 
measures in the second, it follows that if certain of 
these paragraphs are consistently difficult or easy for 
the children, these differences should be reflected by 
the coefficient. 
The computation of the coefficient of correlation 
in this case gave a result of .04 when carried through 
by the Pearsonian method. This indicates an 
amount of agreement that is negligible, and a dis- 
tinctly higher degree of relationship might well have 
been found from purely chance causes. This evi- 
dence, taken in conjunction with the fact that the 
data of the percentages fall within a distinctly mod- 
erate range, indicates that the different paragraphs 
of the scale are genuinely of substantially equal diffi- 
culty for the children. 
TABULATION OF Data Grvine Scores 
When the returns were received from the different 
cities large tabulating sheets were employed ruled 
with a sufficient number of columns to permit enter- 
ing the data identifying the records of each city, 
grade, and individual class, and the number of chil- 
dren having each specified number of paragraphs 
correctly marked, from nothing to 20 inclusive. The 
data included returns from 25 classes in each grade 
from the third through the eighth. The final results 
are presented in Table 2, which shows the number of 
pupils marking correctly each specified number of 
paragraphs in each grade from the third through the 
eighth.

CHARACTERISTICS OF GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS 
An examination of the data of Table 2 shows that the 
distributions of the scores for the six grades are closely 
similar in character. In each case the returns re- 
veal a wide range of ability on the part of the chil- 
dren. In each case relatively few pupils make very 
low scores, fairly good scores are far more numerous, 
and very good ones are relatively rare. The scores 
show that the test is of sufficient length so that 
few pupils can correctly complete all 20 paragraphs 
within the time limit of five minutes.

  AVERAGES AND DEVIATIONS 
The progress of the children in ability from grade to 
grade is reflected by the figures showing the average 
number of paragraphs correctly marked. These 
figures are given in the second column of Table 3 
below. They show that in the third grade the 
average performance was one of nearly five para- 
graphs correctly marked. That of the fourth grade 
is more than two paragraphs better than this, or 
just over seven paragraphs. From this point on the 
average score goes up by approximately one para- 
graph for each advancing grade. If we omit the 
fractions from the average scores by grades the data 
give a performance standard of five paragraphs in 
the third grade, seven in the fourth, eight in the 
fifth, nine in the sixth, ten in the seventh, and 11 in 
the eighth.

The data of the third column of Table 3 confirm the 
conclusions that the six distributions conform in a 
general way to one single type. These data give the 
standard deviations of the series for each grade.

  They indicate that the amount of spread of the dis- 
tributions is nearly the same in all the grades. 
SuMMARY 
1. Data were secured giving the scores made by chil- 
dren tested by Picture Supplement 1 in 25 classes in 
23 school systems. The total number of children 
tested was 4,493. About 750 children were tested in 
each grade from the third through the eighth. 
2. The tests were given from two sets of scales on 
which the paragraphs were printed in different orders 
of sequence and a comparison of the two sets of re- 
sults indicates that the different paragraphs are of 
nearly equal difficulty. 
3. An examination of the scores of the children in 
the different grades shows that the distributions are 
similar to each other in character. 
4. The average performance of the children in the 
third grade was approximately five paragraphs cor- 
rectly marked. That of the fourth grade pupils was 
about seven paragraphs, and for each higher grade 
the average performance increased by one para- 
graph until the average of 11 paragraphs was reached 
in the eighth grade.

  CHAPTER XI 
ASSIGNING CREDITS FOR SCORES 
The data of Table 2, showing the scores of the pupils 
in each of the six grades, are of such nature as to sug- 
gest that the distributions approximate normal dis- 
tributions. In each array the cases are most numer- 
ous at about the middle of the distribution and taper 
off from that point in both directions. This tapering 
off does not exhibit, in the upper grades, any marked 
skew or tendency to run distinctly farther on one 
side than on the other. In the data for each grade 
about as many cases are found below the largest en- 
try in the column as there are above it. 
Since the characteristics of these distributions are 
such as would be found in normal distributions, tests 
have been made to find how close the approximations 
really are. Each set of original score data given in 
Table 2 has been considered as representing a surface 
plotted along a base line with ordinates representing 
the number of pupils correctly marking each number 
of paragraphs. For the purpose of explaining the 
methods used the data for grade five have been 
chosen. 
Since we know the heights of the ordinates and 
their locations on the base line, the next problem is 
114 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  to determine what the ordinates would be if the dis- 
tribution were a normal one. The first step is to dis- 
cover what the heights of the maximum ordinate 
at the average would be for a normal distribution 
having 762 cases, and a standard deviation of 3.37 as 
in the case of the fifth grade data. 
The computation is worked out by using the theo- 
rem that, in a normal distribution, the height of the 
maximum ordinate is equal to the number of cases 
divided by the standard deviation, times the square 
root of 27. This theorem expresses a relationship 
between the area of a normal surface of distribution 
and its maximum ordinate that is not so abstruse as 
it sounds. The square root of 27 is equal to just over 
2.5, so that the theorem really means that the maxi- 
mum ordinate is equal to the number of cases divided 
by 2.5 times the standard deviation. 
Now in a normal surface of distribution very nearly 
the entire area is enclosed between the base line, the 
curve, and ordinates erected at —2.5 and +2.5 sigma 
distance. What the theorem really means then is that 
in the normal surface the relationships between the 
base line, the area, and the maximum ordinate are 
almost the same as they would be in a triangle of the 
same base and height, and that the altitude is equal 
to the area divided by one-half of the base. This ex- 
planation is, of course, only valid if the base line of the 
surface be considered as limited to 2.5 sigma distance 
in each direction, and it disregards the difference be- 
tween 2.5 as the approximate value of the square root 
of 27 and the more exact figure of 2.506627. 
115
-P-A-G-E-116
  In the case of the data for the fifth grade the com- 
putation shows that if they were normally distributed 
the maximum ordinate at the average would be ap- 
proximately 90. From this the heights of the other 
ordinates may be computed by using a table for the 
ordinates of the normal curve. 
Susstirutina Normau ror Actuat DistRIBUTIONS 
The next problem is to find out what the scores of 
each grade would be if they were distributed nor- 
mally. We know for each grade the whole number 
of pupils tested, the number marking correctly each 
specified number of paragraphs, the location of the 
average performance, and the standard deviation of 
the whole distribution. If we consider the scores as 
representing a surface of distribution we can adopt 
a base line running from the lowest to the highest 
score and erect ordinates representing the number of 
pupils correctly marking each number of paragraphs. 
Since we know the standard deviation of the distri- 
bution, we may compute in terms of it the distance 
of each ordinate from the ordinate which is at the 
average. Thus, in the case of the fifth grade, the or- 
dinate representing the 104 children who marked 
eight paragraphs correctly is taken as being at the 
average. Then, since the standard deviation for the 
scores of the grade is 3.37, the ordinate representing 
the 92 pupils who marked seven paragraphs is fur- 
ther to the left than the one at the average and dis- 
tant from it by 1/3.37 of the standard deviation, or 
.297 of it. By similar methods the locations of all 
116
-P-A-G-E-117
  
the ordinates may be determined in terms of their 
distances from the average as measured by the stan- 
dard deviation of the distribution.

through these computations are presented in Table 4

  the table shows the number of pupils in the fifth 
grade who correctly marked each number of para- 
graphs from none to 20. The next to the last column 
shows what these numbers would have been if the 
distribution had been a normal one. 
Diagram 1 on page 119 presents the same facts in 
graphic form. The normal curve is shown by the 
heavy dotted line, while the actual distribution is rep- 
resented by the irregular solid line joining the ends of 
the vertical ordinates. The diagram would represent 
the facts more accurately if both the normal and the 
actual distributions were represented by series of up- 
right, contiguous columns, but in that case the two 
surfaces of distribution would coincide at so many 
points as to make the diagram far less clear than it is 
in its present form. 
The diagram and the figures of the table show that 
the agreement between the actual and the normal 
distribution is close. If both sets of data were rep- 
resented by diagrams drawn to the same scale and 
superimposed upon each other, the percentage of the 
area that would be common to both would be 95 and 
only five per cent of each would lie outside of this 
area of agreement. Similar computations have been 
carried through for all the grades with the results 
that are presented in Table 5 on page 120.

In view of the close agreement between the actual 
and the normal distributions, asset forth by the figures 
of Table 5, the conclusion has been reached that the 
normal distributions probably represent the typical 
results to be expected from using this test more closely 
than do the actual figures of the original data. In 
every case the form of distribution is close to the 
normal, and the departures from the normal appear 
to be chance variations rather than variations obey- 
ing some law or influence of a constant sort. 
One DistRIBuTIon For Au Stix GRADES 
The decision to adopt the normal distribution as the 
most probably valid generalization of the data for 
the several grades involves the further step of adopt- 
ing for all six grades a single form of the normal dis- 
tribution instead of six normal distributions hav- 
ing slightly varying standard deviations. Reference 
back to the data of Table 2 will show that the stan- 
dard deviations range in magnitude from 2.98 to 3.47 
and it is to be remembered that these measurements 
are in terms of paragraphs. 
120
-P-A-G-E-121
Now in a normal surface of distribution so few 
cases lie further from the center than the ordinates 
at 2.5 sigma distance in either direction that they 
constitute less than one per cent of all the cases. 
This means that the range from a point so low that 
less than one per cent of the cases is represented, to 
one so high that again it represents less than one per 
cent of the cases, is one of five times the sigma dis- 
tance. Since the sigma distance measured by the 
standard deviation is in the neighborhood of 3.4 
paragraphs, this property of the normal distribution 
applied in the present case means that there is a 
range of five times 3.4 paragraphs, or 17 paragraphs 
from a record so low that less than one per cent of the 
pupils fail to one so high that less than one per cent 
of them succeed. 
Since the measurement is in terms of paragraphs, 
it must be made in whole units and not in fractions 
and for this reason the small variations in the stan- 
dard deviations may be disregarded and a single stan- 
dard adopted as approximately representing the typi- 
cal tendency in all the grades. This standard form of 
distribution, adopted as typical for all the grades, 
is the one that has been described. It is a normal dis- 
tribution covering a span of 17 paragraphs and ex- 
tending from a point where the failures represent 
less than one per cent of the pupils, up to one where 
less than one per cent of them succeed. 
It may appear that there should be an exception to 
this general rule in the case of the third grade, for 
there the standard deviation is only 2.98 and the 
121  
-P-A-G-E-122
    data of Table 2 show that the pupils making the 
lowest score are more than one per cent of all. The 
explanation is that the test is somewhat too difficult 
for the slowest pupils in the third grade and that in 
this case the distribution is fundamentally similar to 
those of the other grades, but with its lower end cut 
off and a resulting concentration of cases at that por- 
tion of the array. Nevertheless the evidence indi- 
cates that even in this case the normal distribution, 
adopted as typical for all the grades, is applicable. 
Tue Zero Point anp THE UpPer Limir 
The adoption of a single type of distribution for all 
the grades enables us to translate the scores in terms 
of values on a scale running from 0 to 100. The zero 
point on the scale has been taken as being a score so 
low that it is exceeded by more than 99 per cent of 
the pupils. The upper limit is a score so high that 
more than 99 per cent of the pupils fail to reach it. 
The middle of the scale, at the 50 point, is located in 
each case at the average performance. There are 
seventeen paragraphs represented on each grade 
scale, or sixteen steps of six units each from a point 
just above zero to one just below 100. 
CrepiTs FoR ScoRES 
The adoption of the criteria that have been described 
makes possible the construction of Table 6 on page 
123 which gives the classroom credits to be awarded 
for each score in paragraphs correctly marked. The 
table is in reality a tabular presentation of six scales:

one for each of the six grades. By its use all the 
scores that are ordinarily made by the children in 
the six upper grades may be translated into class- 
room credits. 
A Simp.e STaTEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS 
It seems worth while to note at this point that the 
material presented in this chapter is in reality a some- 
what elaborate method of reaching conclusions that 
might be arrived at much more directly. What the 
present reading scale does is to make available test- 
ing material in short, carefully calibrated, units of 
such a nature that they all test the same kinds of 
ability, and are all of equal difficulty. The results 
from using the material indicate that the span of 
ordinary ability among the children of any one of the 
upper grades is such that the brightest will correctly 
mark about 16 paragraphs more than the slowest in 
the five minutes allowed. 
The poorest typical performance is arbitrarily 
called approximately zero, the best approximately 
100, the average is called 50, and the range from 
poorest to best is divided into 16 equal steps. All 
of this could be done without using the computations 
of the normal distribution, but without the added 
assurance of validity that comes from demonstrating 
that the results do in fact nearly correspond to the 
normal distribution. 
In general it may be safely noted that school tests 
could be rendered far better measuring instruments 
than they have been in the past by developing testing 
124
-P-A-G-E-125
material made up of short, equal units of material, 
consistent throughout in nature, and sufficiently nu- 
merous so as to provide more work than the brightest 
pupils could complete within a rigidly controlled 
time limit. Most useful comparisons could be made 
from the results of using such tests without any need 
for introducing elaborate complications in the mathe- 
matical treatment of the material. 
DistriButions From Rate Tests 
The fact that the arrays of the scores in the different 
grades closely conform to the normal distribution is 
one that calls for additional comment because it 
represents a result that might not have been expected 
from a priori grounds. The scores result from apply- 
ing a rate test and it might have been expected that 
they would produce distributions skewed at the 
upper end in a manner indicating that equal, pro- 
gressive increments of ability were reflected by con- 
stantly decreasing increments of accomplishment. 
A result of this sort would naturally be expected in a 
test largely depending on muscular control and speed 
of movement, such as writing and copying figures 
where the fastest performers approach their physio- 
logical limit of output. The failure of any such 
tendency to appear in the present results may per- 
haps be due to the fact that these reading tests call 
for manual dexterity in only a minor degree but 
mainly depend on ability to apprehend correctly 
the meaning of the printed words.

  SUMMARY 
1. The distributions of the scores for the six grades are 
found to conform closely to normal distributions. 
2. Since this general conformity to type is found 
to characterize all six distributions, a single normal 
distribution has been adopted as representing the 
best generalized expression of the data. 
3. The typical normal distribution substituted for 
the original data is one running in sixteen steps from 
a point where less than one per cent of the pupils fail 
up to a point where less than one per cent of them 
succeed. 
4. Scales are substituted for the original scores 
so that the results secured by the pupils may be 
stated in terms of classroom credits running from 
zero to 100 and giving a credit of 50 for the average 
performance in each grade.

CHAPTER XII 
RELIABILITY OF THE SCALE 
The scale for measuring ability in silent reading is an 
instrument that is designed to secure quickly and 
definitely certain information concerning school chil- 
dren that would ordinarily come to light slowly and 
indefinitely, through the regular work of the class- 
room. The reliability of the scale depends on the 
degree to which it succeeds in showing, by a sampling 
process that lasts for five minutes, how much ability 
any given child has in careful reading. Its practical 
usefulness will be large if its findings are generally 
corroborated by the verdict of practical experience; 
and it will be small if there are many cases in which 
the record of the pupil is high when tested by the 
scale, but low in the daily work of the classroom, or 
vice versa. The scale is in reality a short cut to 
definite knowledge concerning the ability of children 
that can ordinarily be secured only through long and 
varied experience; and because this is its nature, it 
follows that a true estimate of its reliability can only 
be made after it has been widely used, and its results 
have been checked up by the varied records of other 
classroom work in careful silent reading. 
During the experimental work that has developed 
127  
-P-A-G-E-128
  the present scale, attempts have been made to test 
its reliability by using it more than once with the 
same children, and by comparing its results with 
those obtained from using other reading tests. While 
these comparisons do not at all take the place of the 
results that can only be secured through practical 
classroom work, they have a certain significance, and 
are presented in this chapter, as worthy of comment, 
but not as conclusive. 
Five sets of comparisons will be noted. The first 
of these presents results that were secured in giving 
the present test twice to the same children. The 
second set compares the results secured from using 
the present scale with those obtained from testing 
the same children with the Kansas Silent Reading 
Test devised by Dr. F. J. Kelly. The three remain- 
ing sets of records present comparisons between re- 
sults obtained by using the present scale and those 
from testing the same children with other scales 
which have been developed in the course of the in- 
vestigations described in the present volume. 
Two TRIALS OF THE SAME SCALE 
Through the courtesy of Dr. Harold O. Rugg and 
the teachers of the Lincoln School, in New York 
City, tests with Picture Supplement Scale 1 were 
given to all the children in five grades, on a single 
morning. The following morning the same test was 
given to the same children; and the score which each 
child received on the first test was paired with that 
which he received on the second. Table 7 shows for 
128
-P-A-G-E-129
  each grade tested the coefficient of correlation be- 
tween the first and second trials, and its correspond- 
ing coefficient of reliability. The probable errors of 
the correlations are not given because the numbers 
of cases are in each grade less than 30, and the usual 
formula for probable error cannot therefore be used.

1 Reliability, two trials,= 7". ‘The coefficient of reliability measures 
the extent to which the amalgamated results of the two trials of a single 
test would correlate with a similar amalgamuted series of results from two 
other trials with the same test. See, Brown, William, The Essentials of 
Me Bc = easurement, Cambridge University Press, London, England. 1911, 
PP. ee é 
It is to be noted in considering the data presented 
in Table 7 that the coefficients of correlation measure 
the degree to which the pupils repeated in their 
second testing the kinds of performances that they 
made in the first test. The coefficients measure the 
degree to which children who made good scores in the 
first test also made good ones in the second test, and 
conversely, the degree to which those who did poorly 
the first time also did poorly the second time. When 
the correlations are fairly high they show that there 
9 129  
-P-A-G-E-130
  was substantial agreement in the results of the two 
testings, but that this fell short of being complete. 
These results give us more information with regard 
to the children than they do with regard to the test. 
They show us that some children who did well on the 
first day performed quite differently on the following 
day; and the same type of statement may be made 
about those who made poor records on the first trial. 
Such results are regularly met with in giving class- 
room tests, and are familiar to every teacher. They 
are also found in the more exact measurements of the 
psychological laboratory. In his book on Mental 
and Social Measurements, 2d edition, chapter VII, 
Professor E. L. Thorndike gives, in Table 19, an in- 
teresting set of results secured by testing ten indi- 
viduals 12 successive times with exactly the same 
test. The results vary so widely from trial to trial 
that in some instances the subjects made two or three 
times as high a score in some of their trials as they 
did in others. Because of these variations, the co- 
efficients of correlation between the scores for the 
different trials fall far short of being perfect, and 
vary through a wide range. The coefficient of cor- 
relation between the scores of the ten individuals in 
their first trial and those for their third trial is as low 
as .36, while that between their first trial and their 
ninth is as high as .90. The average of the coeffi- 
cients of correlation between the first trial and the 
11 other trials is .65. 
The data illustrate in an impressive way the fact 
that the same individuals exhibit widely varying 
130
-P-A-G-E-131
  capacities and abilities when taking identically the 
same test on different days. Such variations may 
constitute in some measure a basis for valid criticism 
of the test used; but in the main they appear to 
reflect a real and inevitable variability of human per- 
formance. The important fact to remember about 
such scores is that they may vary from day to day 
and still be actual true measures of ability on each 
occasion. Under such conditions the fact that the 
scores vary from trial to trial does not reflect any 
inaccuracy or inadequacy of the test or measuring 
device. The situation is then similar to that en- 
countered when boys are being tested in running to 
select those who shall represent their school in an 
athletic meet. The stop-watch is an accurate mea- 
suring instrument, but it shows that the same boys 
run at different rates on repeated trials on different 
days, and if two sets of the scores be correlated, the 
resulting coefficients are far from being perfect. 
The numbers of cases involved in the data cited by 
Professor Thorndike are too limited to make the 
actual coefficients significant; but the figures well 
reflect the variability that characterizes such mea- 
surements. If the data were more numerous, the 
individual variations would remain, but the range 
of the correlations would presumably be diminished. 
CoEFFIcIENTS OF RELIABILITY 
The coefficients of reliability given in the last column 
of Table 7 call for further comment since they are 
measures that are being used with increasing fre- 
131
-P-A-G-E-132
  quency in educational researches. What Brown’s 
formula really does is to compare the coefficient of 
correlation between one pair of results from two ap- 
plications of a test with the coefficient of correlation 
that would be obtained between one average of 
scores from two or more testings and another similar 
average of scores from two or more other testings. 
The results furnish a means for determining how 
many times the test would have to be repeated in 
order to discover with any desired degree of relia- 
bility the relative standings of the different pupils. 
The method is of limited value because it is impos- 
sible to tell whether the correlation between the first 
two testings is low, average, or high. In the case of 
the data given by Professor Thorndike, and referred 
to in the preceding section, the correlations between 
the various testings of the same individuals with the 
same test ranged from .36 to .90. If the coefficient 
of reliability were based on the lowest correlation it 
would indicate that the results of no fewer than 16 
different testings would have to be amalgamated in 
order to give a reliability coefficient of .90. If it were 
based on the highest correlation it would indicate 
that no amalgamation at all would be necessary to 
produce the same result. It is clear that the method 
is of limited significance and utility because, when 
we give a test twice and compute the correlation, we 
do not know whether the relationship indicated by 
this single computation is lower or higher than the 
average of several such correlations would be. 
The fundamental assumption behind the method 
132
-P-A-G-E-133
  is that groups repeatedly tested by the same methods 
will consistently vary to about the same degree, in 
about the same way, from trial to trial. If this as- 
sumption were valid, the correlation between the re- 
sults of any two trials would be typical of all similar 
correlations between scores for other pairs of trials. 
Unfortunately, these assumptions are valid only in 
moderate degree. Consistency of performance in 
repeated testings is an essential condition if the co- 
efficient of reliability is to be valid; and, in propor- 
tion as such consistency exists, the coefficient be- 
comes unnecessary. 
PicturE SUPPLEMENT SCALE AND Kansas (KELLY) 
TEST 
Through the courtesy of Mr. Don C. Bliss, Superin- 
tendent of Schools of Montclair, New Jersey, records 
were secured for three groups of children who were 
tested by Picture Supplement Scale 1, and had previ- 
ously been tested by the Kansas Silent Reading 
Test, devised by Dr. F. J. Kelly. Table 8 shows for 
these three groups the coefficients of correlation 
between paired scores in the two tests.

  It is noteworthy that the coefficients of correlation 
between the results from using the present scale and 
those obtained from the Kelly test are on the average 
even higher than those obtained from testing the 
same pupils twice by means of the present scale. 
Nevertheless, the same comments apply in this case 
that have been made in the preceding paragraphs 
which discussed the results presented in Table 7. 
The Kansas Silent Reading Test has been widely 
used, but we have as yet few data measuring the 
degree to which it serves as a trustworthy indicator 
of the reading ability of the children. 
The figures in the fourth column of the table give 
the probable error of the coefficient of correlation, 
and indicate that the mathematical chances are 
even that the true coefficient that would be obtained 
from repeated trials lies within the range above and 
below the coefficient actually obtained that is indi- 
cated by the amounts stated in the figures of the 
fourth column. While conservative practice de- 
mands that the coefficient of correlation must be 
several times as large as its probable error to be con- 
sidered significant, it must be remembered that this 
is merely a measure of the reliability of the coefficient, 
and not one of the reliability of the test. In the 
present instance, the coefficients are many times as 
large as their probable errors. 
Picture SupPLEMENT 1 AND ConTINUOUS 
Narrative 1 
An account has already been given, in Chapter III 
of this monograph, of five different scales for measur- 
134 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
ing silent reading which were developed, and the 
classroom scores of which were secured, in the pro- 
cess of the experimentation which led to the produc- 
tion of Picture Supplement Scale 1. Records were 
secured for some 1,200 children, most of whom were 
tested by Picture Supplement Scale 1, and by three 
of the other five scales developed earlier. 
Table 9 shows the coefficients of correlation be- 
tween scores secured by children on Picture Supple- 
ment Scale 1 and scores received by the same chil- 
dren when tested by the Easy Continuous Narra- 
tive Scale. This latter scale has already been de- 
scribed at some length in Chapter III. It is a scale 
which calls for a less careful and more rapid type of 
reading; the sort of reading, that is, which is ordi- 
narily used when a child reads an easy and interesting 
story for the pleasure he gets out of it. It is not so 
much a measure of careful reading as is Picture Sup- 
plement Scale 1.

Table 10 presents coefficients of correlation for the 
same children as Table 9. In the present case, how- 
ever, the comparisons are made between scores on 
Picture Supplement Scale 1 and a longer and con- 
siderably more difficult Continuous Narrative Scale. 
In this instance the coefficients of correlation range 
from .37 to .74, and in every case the coefficients are 
many times as large as their probable errors. If 
the criteria presented by Dr. H. O. Rugg in his book 
on “Statistical Methods Applied to Education” be 
adopted, the coefficients of correlation in this and the 
other tables of this chapter may be regarded as 
clearly indicating that genuine and controlling re- 
lationships are basal to these results. Dr. Rugg con- 
cludes (p. 256) that in material of this general sort 
coefficients of correlation are ‘“‘marked’’ when they 
range from .35 or .40 to .50 or .60, and “high’”’ when 
they are above .60 or .70.

The last table in this series, Table 11, presents the 
correlations for 1,170 children when the scores they 
made on the new Picture Supplement Scale 1 were 
compared with their scores when tested by another 
Picture Supplement Scale, in which the thought, 
instructions, mechanical presentation, etc., were of 
the same kind as those in PS-1, but the vocabulary 
used consisted of much longer words. The two scales 
measure the same sort of reading ability; but one is 
at a higher level of difficulty than the other.

Here, as in the preceding tables, the probable 
errors are given in the third column and in the fourth 
there are figures showing that the coefficients of cor- 
relation are many times as large as their probable 
errors. The purpose of comparing the coefficients of 
correlation with their probable errors is to find out 
137  
-P-A-G-E-138
whether there is good evidence that there is an actual 
interdependence of the functions being measured. 
In the present case this means that the object is to 
find out whether the data indicate that the reading 
ability of the children is really being measured by 
the two scales in such a way that poor readers will 
generally be identified as such by both scales and 
good readers will be scored as good in each case. 
The rule is that a coefficient is not considered as good 
evidence of such an existing correspondence unless 
it is fairly high and at least three or four times as 
large as its probable error. 
The theory of the use of the probable error is that 
it indicates the reliability of the data derived from 
the sample being dealt with. In the present case the 
statistics which we have relate to a limited group of 
children, and the question is how far we can trust 
conclusions based on relatively few cases and from 
them generalize about the scores to be expected from 
other children of similar ages and grades. 
The rule is that if our cases represent a genuinely 
unselected random sampling from a much larger 
group, the reliability of our conclusions can be mea- 
sured, and will vary as the square root of the number 
of cases taken. In Table 11 the coefficient of cor- 
relation for grade 5 is .75 and the probable error is 
about .02. This means that if we could test all fifth 
grade children, instead of merely these 200, and com- 
pute the coefficients of correlation for this great num- 
ber of samples of 200 children each, we should find 
that one half of our coefficients would be less than 
138
-P-A-G-E-139
  .75+.02, but greater than .75—.02. They would 
lie between .73 and .77; while the other half would 
lie outside of these limits. We cannot tell what the 
true correlation would be, but we can tell something 
of the limits within which the true correlation would 
probably vary from the obtained correlation. The 
statement as to the size of the probable error is a 
statement of the degree of our ignorance, which grows 
less as the samples grow larger. 
Fortunately, in the present case, the samples are 
fairly large and taken from a sufficiently varied set 
of cities so that they may perhaps approximate true 
random samplings. Since the coefficients of correla- 
tion are fairly high, the sizes of the probable errors 
represent relatively small percentages of probable 
departure of the true data from the obtained data. 
Summary 
1. The true test of the reliability of the scale will be 
found in its degree of utility in the classroom in 
quickly securing accurate and definite information as 
to the ability of the children in careful, silent reading. 
2. Repeated testings of the same children with the 
same scale indicate that it operates with a large de- 
gree of consistency. 
8. There is high correlation between results ob- 
tained from testing children with this scale and test- 
ing the same children with the Kansas Silent Reading 
Test. 
4. Repeated testings of large numbers of children 
with this scale, and with other scales developed by 
the same author, give high coefficients of correlation 
and low probable errors.

APPENDIX 
Chapter III of this monograph contains brief descriptions of 
the five preliminary scales for measuring silent reading which 
were developed in the course of the investigations which led 
to the adoption of Picture Supplement Scale 1. On the pages 
that follow, a brief statement is given concerning the char- 
acteristics of each of these scales. No attempt is made to 
reproduce them in full, with pictures, method of scoring, etc., 
but the text of each is included, in the hope that it may be of 
suggestive value to students of educational measurement. 
The five scales were all of the same general plan as Picture 
Supplement Scale 1; that is, they were all on sheets of paper 
11 inches wide and 19 inches long, divided into five columns 
of four divisions each. All the scales consisted of pictures, and 
paragraphs of instructions for marking the pictures. 
Two Hwarinc-Reapina ScALEs 
The Hearing-Reading scales were printed on both sides. On 
the front side were 20 pictures. The teacher read aloud in- 
structions for marking each picture with a pencil, and the 
children, having listened to the instructions, proceeded to fol- 
low them. After all the pictures on the front of the sheet had 
been so marked, in accordance with instructions to which the 
children had listened, the sheets were turned over. On the 
back was a similar set of pictures, but in this case the instruc- 
tions were printed directly beneath each one. Instead of 
listening to the teacher reading aloud, the children read the 
paragraphs for themselves and, as they finished silently read- 
ing each paragraph, they followed the instructions it gave by 
marking the picture above it with their pencils. Both the 
140
-P-A-G-E-141
  paragraphs read aloud by the teacher and the printed para- 
graphs that the children read to themselves were graded in 
ascending difficulty of vocabulary from very simple ones at 
the beginning to extremely difficult ones towards the end of 
each scale. Each paragraph on one scale corresponded to 
another of approximately the same difficulty on its companion 
scale. 
The underlying idea of these hearing-reading scales was to 
use them first to secure a record of the ability of the child to 
follow instructions received through hearing them, and then te 
secure a second record of his ability to follow another set of 
instructions of equal difficulty, when he had to get their mean- 
ing by reading them himself. Both sets of records having been 
secured, they were to be compared, in order to find out how 
nearly the child, when reading, could equal the record that he 
made when he listened and did not have to read. 
The material which is reproduced below is the text of the 
20 paragraphs printed on the silent reading side of Hearing- 
Reading Scale 1. It is also the material which was read aloud 
by the teacher in giving the tests of Hearing-Reading Scale 2. 
The second series of paragraphs reproduces the material which 
appeared on the silent reading side of the second scale, and 
was read aloud by the teacher when the tests with the first 
scale were given. 
Hearina-Reapine Scare 1 
1. This little girl enjoys a ride on her donkey. She has to hold 
on when he goes fast but she does not mind that. She would 
like him to go fast all the time. Look at the stick that is in her 
hand and with your pencil draw a cord at the end of it to make 
a whip that she may use if she has need of one. 
2. This man and his horse have been having a good time. 
They have gone a long way very fast, but the strong horse is 
not tired. He likes to trot and gallop, and now he rears up on 
his hind legs to show that he wants to jump. Draw a fence in 
front of him so that he can jump over it and show his master 
how well trained he is. 
141

    3. It is not safe to carry around a sharp weapon unless a 
cover is on it, for it is easy to hit the man back of you and 
wound him. Take your pencil and in this picture of the Arab 
chief draw a round ball on the point of the tall spear so as to 
keep people who may be struck by it from being badly cut. 
4, When people are in a great hurry to write the word nuM- 
BER they sometimes use the short form No., which means the 
same thing, to save time and space. The number of this sec- 
tion is 4 and you are now asked to write 4 in the center of the 
sign placed just over this printed part which tells you what the 
two letters mean. 
5. This little boy is wearing his older sister’s best hat to 
make believe he is a girl. He is going along the street to visit 
his friends and make them laugh. Take your pencil and write 
the words THISs 1s on one side and a Boy on the opposite side of 
the picture so that people can learn at a glance which he is. 
6. This banner tells you that the weather will be fair. If 
you now look back at the previous picture, you will notice that 
the child has an umbrella to protect the hat his sister lent him. 
Put several small crosses upon the handle and body of the 
umbrella to show that it will not be needed. 
7. This tiny chipmunk is poised on a big flat stone watching 
you with alert eyes and preparing to start away at a moment’s 
notice. With a pencil outline three circles close to the boulder 
in front of him to represent nuts so that he will know that you 
intend to be a kind friend and he should not be afraid. 
8. Would you prefer a turban instead of a cap? This fel- 
low’s is made from several yards of cotton material wound 
around his head, with the loose ends tucked underneath. 
Draw a rather short feather standing upright in the folds of the 
head dress and extending above the head where it can wave in 
the breeze. 
9. These rabbits have been stealing cabbages in the garden. 
They jumped over the fence, but were startled to find them- 
142
-P-A-G-E-143
selves in the front yard where everybody could see them. 
Hastily draw a continuous line around both the naughty little 
animals to prevent them from escaping until you have a chance 
to scold them. 
10. To make a suitable support for this ornamental and 
expensive clock take your pencil and with a single deftly 
directed stroke depict a simple horizontal shelf upon which the 
clock can remain firmly placed without fear of its being over- 
turned or accidentally injured through a fall. 
11. The sleeping children are so comfortable wrapped in 
their feather coverlets that they will not respond readily to 
their mother’s calling, urging them to hurry dressing. Return 
therefore to the picture of the clock and write 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 
beside it to show that it is striking seven and summoning 
people to come to breakfast. 
12. Here is an ornamental frame decorated with leaf and 
berry and intended as a plan for embroidery on household 
linen. You are required at once to print the initial of your last 
name with your pencil carefully but without hesitation in the 
vacant square which has been provided for that express pur- 
pose. 
13. This energetic youth with the long hair is practicing for 
the approaching big football game. His specialty is long 
distance kicking, and you are required to hasten to his assist- 
ance by drawing a properly inflated pigskin ball soaring up and 
forward from the blow of his forceful propelling kick. 
14. 1920 is leap year, and February has 29 days instead of 
28. Upon the accompanying calendar encircle the following 
dates to indicate that they are all important days: Thursday, 
February 12, which is Lincoln’s birthday, Saturday, the 14th, 
for Saint Valentine’s Day, and Sunday, the 22d, for Washing- 
ton’s birthday. 
15. With pencil proceed immediately to blacken the lower 
section of each bulb in this old-fashioned hourglass as high as 
the horizontal line, so representing the supply of sand which 
143

  originally confined in the upper portion trickles through the 
intervening aperture and gradually accumulates in the 
bottom. 
16. When this bloodthirsty Zulu throws his murderous 
spear the unsuspecting foe will be instantly decapitated. 
With haste turn to the succeeding paragraph and inscribe 
the admonitory letters panGur directly before the eyes of the 
policeman to warn of the impending tragedy and stimulate 
preventive measures. 
17. As you commanded this strenuous officer to extend his 
jurisdiction to neighboring characters and forestall the attack 
contemplated by the aboriginal, hastily sketch in his clenched 
fist a policeman’s club, billy, or cudgel with which he may quell 
the next attack of the unscrupulous potential criminal. 
18. Warn the busy public that telephonic communication 
has been temporarily suspended by inscribing the annoyingly 
familiar declaration, so often mét in similar cases, NOT WORK- 
NG to the left of the transmitter and somewhat above the 
receiver of this practically useless instrument. 
19. The pictorial representation of riches frequently as- 
sumes the guise here presented. With your pencil contribute 
a gay touch by portraying in the side of the receptacle an 
irregular incision through which the laboriously collected 
dollars may expeditiously escape imprisonment and accrue to 
the impoverished bystander. 
20. The dragon is a mythological beast who symbolizes the 
extremities of wickedness and is frequently met in the old liter- 
ature. In an appropriate spot beside this interesting engraving 
elucidate its meaning to observers who misunderstand its 
significance by appending the inscription pRaGoN.

1. This dog sees a cat in the street. He does not like cats and 
he hates this one. He will watch her and if she comes too near 
he will bark at her and chase her up a tree. We do not want 
144
-P-A-G-E-145
  him to chase the cat. Take your pencil and draw a rope about 
his neck so that he can not run after her. 
2. This man is what is known as an Eskimo. He lives in the 
far north where it is cold and there is much snow. When he has 
to travel he rides on a big sled and is drawn over the ice by a 
team of dogs. Take your pencil and mark out the whip he 
carries in his hand so that he will not be able to whip any of his 
dogs. 
3. Someone was reading this big book and left it open on his 
desk. It should be closed and put back upon the shelves, but 
the reader does not want to lose his place. With your lead 
pencil make a light mark on the left hand page so that when he 
takes the book down again he will know where to begin reading. 
4, Look at this poor Indian. His clothes are not thick 
enough to keep him warm. He is so cold that he has wrapped 
his blanket close about him. Part of the blanket drags on the 
ground and will soon become torn and soiled. Put a neat little 
cross on the end of the blanket which drags on the ground. 
5. Have you ever noticed such a strange bird as this? He is 
not easy to find because he usually is asleep during the daytime 
and does not leave the dark woods until night begins to fall. 
Take a pencil and make it possible for people to learn what the 
bird’s name is by writing the word owt beside the picture. 
6. This small chap is afraid to start for school without his 
books. The teacher will scold unless he brings them, but the 
owl is sitting on them and the little fellow cannot scare him 
away. Grasp your pencil bravely and cross the owl out of the 
previous picture with two black lines, so that the child can 
rescue his belongings. 
7. These two flags are used as signals by the men on guard 
to give warning of probable changes in weather conditions. 
Write rarr as a title under the white flag because it indicates 
pleasant weather and place storm under the blue one since 
when it is displayed a storm is coming within twenty-four

8. Glance at these servants who propel between them an 
unusual covered chair. Have you a notion about the identity 
of the one riding in the chair? He does not want people to 
guess his secret. In order to prevent curious persons from find- 
ing out who is riding inside take your pencil and blacken all the 
windows. 
9. This pictures a Christmas pudding with twigs of holly 
around the platter and lighted candles at the ends. You can 
see plump and juicy raisins scattered over the surface. It will 
be sure to taste delicious. Draw a sharp carving knife thrust 
in the pudding ready to sever a thick slice for everyone attend- 
ing the banquet. 
10. Hasten to assist this gay and lively young lady, who is 
having such a delightful afternoon all by herself, by drawing a 
strong skipping rope in her hands with your ready pencil so that 
while she is practicing she will enjoy the possession of a real 
rope instead of an imaginary one. 
11. This small maid evidently believes her dress is most 
correct for outdoor sport. Her neat black slippers and bonnet 
are especially attractive. With your pencil proceed to blacken 
the cap of the athletic child in the picture about which you 
have just finished reading so that she also will be fashionable. 
12. The children anticipated Santa Claus’ visit and will soon 
enjoy the attractive presents they find in their stockings. As 
they will be especially anxious to ascertain the nature of the 
bundles which are partly concealed picture with your pencil a 
small hole in one foot through which they can satisfy curiosity. 
13. This butterfly has been confined in a warm cocoon, but 
as summer is approaching he has abandoned his old dwelling 
and is eagerly exploring the world. Draw a branch on which 
he can remain comfortably for a while to prevent his newly 
formed wings from becoming quickly fatigued from unaccus- 
tomed exercise. 
14. This middle aged gentleman practices diligently in the 
gymnasium since he is convinced that it is foolhardy to grow

slight elevation the goal toward which his pitching should be 
unceasingly directed. 
15. This dignified old eagle with spreading wings is in a 
particularly risky position on a smoothly polished sphere. 
Forestall the likelihood of his being suddenly overturned by 
drawing with your pencil two stones of moderate size in imme- 
diate juxtaposition to the sphere to keep it from rolling. 
16. After studying the accompanying banner which indi- 
cates approaching cold temperature go back to the seventh 
paragraph, in which selection signals for FArR and STORM were 
reproduced and their significance discussed, and transform 
Farr to cop by inserting a central black square in the white 
pennant there presented. 
17. This cheerfully smiling newspaper worker brings man- 
uscripts to the editorial desk for examination and decision as to 
final destinations. With pencil picture a narrow tape securely 
confining this tottering pile, to avoid the inextricable confusion 
immediately resulting from dropping it. 
18. It is certainly interesting to help this noted performer 
give an exhibition of remarkable dexterity. As he is contem- 
plating the possibility of balancing a stick on his nose increase 
the difficulty of securing equilibrium by drawing in pencil a 
moderately small circle representing an orange poised on the 
extremity of the rod. 
19. This curiously made cross is used as a decoration on 
propagandic literature of the American Tuberculosis Associa-

  Two Continvovs Narrative SCALES 
The two continuous narrative scales were on a different plan 
from those just described. Each scale consisted of a short and 
interesting story which was divided into 20 sections of equal 
length, and these sections were then so arranged that the lo- 
cation of each one could only be found by reading the section 
preceding it. The child was allowed to read for five minutes. 
Both scales were alike in their general plan; but the second 
contained one-seventh more material in each paragraph than 
did the first, and the thought was somewhat harder. The 
material reproduced below gives the text of both stories, with 
the paragraphs arranged in the order in which they came if 
the child found and read each correctly. 
It will be noted that in both the Continuous Narrative 
Scales the paragraphs uniformly carry two instruction 
thoughts apiece. One of these tells the child where to find the 
paragraph that follows in the sequence of the story. The 
other tells him what number he is to write beside the picture 
of the paragraph when he locates it. Classroom experimen- 
tation seems to show that to the child these numbers are a 
necessary part of the story. In the first scale he writes them 
down in order to keep track of how many people helped in 
teaching the little Prince to like books; and in the second 
he is asked to number the pieces of evidence in the order in 
which they were presented at the government trial where 
John testified against the band of spies. The children do not 
know it, but the fact is that in each scale these numbers run 
from 1 to 20, and indicate how many paragraphs the child has 
read up to that point. The result is that the child leaves a 
record behind him which tells the teacher where he went and 
what he did. If he has read and marked the story correctly, 
the highest number written is his score on the test.

The Prince’s Book 
Once upon a time there was a lazy little Prince. He knew how 
to read, but he did not like to do it. His Father the King was 
148
-P-A-G-E-149
  naturally very much worried, and finally he called Pen and 
Paper to help him. ‘They will know how to make my little 
son like books,’’ he thought, and he sent a messenger to call 
them. Now Pen and Paper were the first people who tried 
to help the Prince to like books, so you must find their picture, 
which is just below this, and write a figure 1 beside it with 
your pencil. Then go on reading to learn what they said to 
the King. 
“The Prince will like books,” said Pen and Paper, ‘if we 
write one for him.” “Write it, and send it by the Postman,” 
said the King. As the Postman was the second person to help 
with the Prince’s book find his picture in the last column and 
write 2 beside it. Then go on reading to learn what he did 
about the book. 
“Dear me!” said the Postman, ‘This is a heavy book. It 
is full of stories for the little Prince. I must run to the castle 
and give it to him.”’ If you will look in the third column you 
will find a picture of the Prince reading his book, and as the 
book was the third one to help him, write 3 beside it, and read 
what happened next. 
“Will you read me?” asked the Book. “Yes,” said the 
Prince, “I shall begin now and read all night.” But his Queen 
Mother said ‘“‘No!”’ She pointed with her hand. She was 
the fourth who saw the Prince’s book, so hunt for her hand in 
the fourth column, number it .4, and read what she was 
pointing at. 
“T shall not let you read all night,” said the Queen. ‘“‘When 
the hourglass says so, you must go to bed,” and she pointed 
to the hourglass. The hourglass was the fifth person to think 
about the Prince’s book, so find its picture at the top of this 
column and write a 5 beside it. Then read what it said to the 
Prince. 
“Tf you read fast,” said the hourglass, ‘‘and if I let my sand 
run slowly, you will be able to finish one story before bedtime.” 
“Then,” said the Prince, ‘I shall start here at the rabbits’ 
picture.” As this picture was the sixth thing that helped the 
it 149
-P-A-G-E-150
  little Prince, find it in the fourth column, write 6 by it, and 
read the story. 
Two White Rabbits rushed from the woods. Something 
dreadful had happened. They must tell somebody. Ahead 
was a big flat rock and on it sat Mr. Chipmunk. As he was 
the seventh person who helped the Prince, find his picture in 
the next column and write a 7 beside it. Then read the dread- 
ful news the Rabbits told him. 
“Mr. Chipmunk!” cried the Rabbits, ‘A Dragon is in the 
Queen’s garden. He is knocking down her golden apple trees!” 
Mr. Chipmunk sat up straight. ‘Call Bill, the fat boy!” he 
ordered; and since Bill was the eighth person to help the 
Prince read, find his picture in the first column, write 8 by it, 
and read what he did. 
“Bill,” said Mr. Chipmunk, ‘Beat your drum! Call all 
the animals together. We must ask them what to do about 
the Dragon.” Away ran Bill to get his drum. It was the 
ninth thing which helped the Prince to read, so find it in the 
second column and write 9 beside it. Then read what hap- 
pened when the drum sounded. 
Bill stood on the rock and beat hisdrum. ‘Hurry up-hurry 
up-up-up-up!”’ it called, and all the animals for miles around 
heard it and came running. The first to arrive was Black 
Horse, who was the tenth one to help the Prince read. Find 
his picture in the fourth column, mark it 10, and read what 
they told him. 
“What's the matter?” neighed Horse. ‘Dragon’s in the 
Queen’s garden!” chattered Chipmunk. “Dear me! What 
shall we do? Let’s ask the Ducks!’’ Now they were the 
eleventh set of people trying to help the little prince read, so 
find them in the second column and write 11 beside them. 
Then read what the Ducks said. 
“What shall we do?” neighed Horse. ‘“Quack!” cried 
White Duck, and “Quack!” cried Black Duck in a determined 
way, “Ask Dog. He knows,’’ and they pointed at Dog with 
their bills. As he was the twelfth person to teach the Prince, 
150 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
find him in the last column, write 12 beside him, and read 
what he answered. 
Dog hung his head. “I don’t know what to do,” he said. 
“Let’s ask the Peacocks. They think they’re very wise.” 
So all the animals ran to see the Peacocks, who had the thir- 
teenth chance to help the little Prince. Find their picture in 
column two and number it 13. Then read how they acted 
when they heard. 
“Mr. and Mrs. Peacock, give us advice!” But the Peacocks 
turned their backs. ‘Go away!’ said Mr. Peacock crossly, 
“go away!”? “Break down their fountain!” neighed Horse, 
but Donkey, who was the fourteenth person to help the Prince, 
interfered. Mark his picture in the last column 14 and read 
why. 
“This is no time,’ brayed Donkey severely, “to talk to 
silly Peacocks. Dragon is in the garden, and we must get 
him out. Bees are wise, let’s ask them.” All the animals 
rushed to the Beehive; and since it was the fifteenth to help 
the Prince, find it in the third column, number it 15, and read 
what happened next. 
“Beehive,” brayed Donkey, ‘Where are the Bees?” 
“Tnside,” said Beehive, “Listen!’””) They heard a whisper 
from inside, ‘Eat leaves from the magic tree—Buzzz!” Now 
that tree was the sixteenth thing to help the Prince read, so 
find it in this column, mark it 16, and read how the animals 
ate its leaves. 
The Rabbits stood on their hind legs and bit off leaves for 
everyone. As the last piece went down the donkey’s throat— 
FLASH! A Magician with a spear stood before them. As 
he was the seventeenth person to help the Prince, find him in 
the second column and write 17 beside him. Then read what 
he did. 
“What do you want?” thundered the Magician. ‘Please, 
Sir, Dragon is breaking down the Queen’s apple trees!” ‘He 
must stop that!” said the Magician, “Slave, appear!”” Up 
from the earth sprang a Savage Warrior whom you must find 
151  
-P-A-G-E-152
  in the last column and mark 18. Then read what the Magician 
made him do. 
“Take my spear,” ordered the Magician, ‘and drive the 
Dragon out of the garden.” ‘Yes, Sir, right away, Sir,” and 
grasping the spear Warrior dashed away to find the Dragon 
who was the nineteenth person to help the Prince read. Find 
him in the first column, write 19 beside him, and read what the 
Warrior did. 
Warrior threw his spear straight into Dragon’s tail; and 
off rushed Dragon, out of the garden, through the fields, and 
over the mountains, with the spear still in his tail. ‘Never,’ 
said he, “will I go back there again!” and it was twenty years 
before he did. So write 20 under the 19, to show how long 
it was. 
Continuous Narrative ScaLe 2 
How John Saved the Warship 
This page is a test to see if you can think as clearly and act 
as carefully as John Tuxon, who in 1917 discovered a band of 
spies, saved a United States warship, and appeared as chief 
witness in a famous trial. Each picture represents one step 
in the evidence presented at the trial. You must read carefully 
enough to find each new piece of evidence and number it 
according to directions given in the paragraphs. This is the 
story: A circus reached town at midnight and John’s parents 
let him watch it. He walked beside a cowboy riding a broncho. 
The cowboy’s picture appears below. As he was the first of 
the accused to testify at the trial, make a number 1 beside it 
and read the paragraph below it. 
In the darkness no one paid any attention to the boy. 
Ahead of the horseman walked a Chinaman. John noticed 
that he carried a fan behind which he talked in a low tone to 
the man beside him. The Chinaman is pictured in the third 
column. As he was later the second on the list of those tried, 
number him 2. Then go on reading and find out to whom the 
Chinaman talked next. 
152
-P-A-G-E-153
  
The Chinaman fell back beside the cowboy and muttered a 
few words which John did not catch. Then he strode forward 
to catch up with a gorgeously attired Mexican who, wearing a 
large sombrero, strolled along smoking a black cigar. His 
picture is in the second column and should be marked 3. Then 
read what John heard the Chinaman saying. 
The Chinaman and the Mexican were talking together. 
John caught the words—‘“In half an hour, at the fisherman’s 
hut.”’ He was listening for more when suddenly he felt a 
heavy hand on his shoulder. He looked up into the stern face 
of a man in the uniform of a French officer. In column 3 is his 
picture. Number it 4 and read how John felt when the French- 
man caught him listening. 
The officer was scowling. ‘‘Go home!” he ordered bruskly, 
and his accent was not that of a real Frenchman. John was 
frightened. He started back as if to go home, but took a short 
cut to the circus grounds and hid behind a large Ferris Wheel 
that was already erected. A picture of his hiding place appears 
at the foot of this column. Mark it 5 and read what John saw 
as he watched. 
John remembered that the Chinaman had whispered—“ In 
half an hour, at the fisherman’s hut.’’ He knew where that 
hut was and wondered what they could want there. Soon the 
circus performers reached the grounds and John saw the 
Chinaman talking to a man in a black coat, white trousers, 
and tall white cap, whose picture is in the fourth column. 
Mark it 6 and then read to learn what they did. 
Soon the cowboy, Mexican, and French officer strolled 
away and disappeared in the night. The Chinaman and his 
companion approached a jolly Irishman with a silk hat and 
stick who was amusing the crowd by the campfire. A picture 
of him is in the last column. As the seventh step in the 
evidence number it 7 and go on reading to find out why the 
Chinaman was interested in the Irishman. 
They whispered to the Irishman and hurriedly followed 
the others. The Irishman, still laughing, left the crowd, 
153  
-P-A-G-E-154
    
giving a light tap as he passed on the shoulder of an elaborately 
robed oriental king whose crown shone in the firelight. His 
picture will be found in the fourth column. Number it 8. 
Then read where the conspirators went and what John did 
when he saw them go. 
By this time John was greatly excited. He determined to 
reach the hut first. Fortunately he knew a good short cut, 
so that when the first of the conspirators appeared he was 
safely hidden in the bushes beside the old cottage. A picture 
of it appears in the first column. This picture was the ninth 
exhibit in the trial, so number it 9 and read what John dis- 
covered in the fisherman’s hut. 
The men entered the hut and John peeked through the 
window. Inside was a strange group. Circus life furnished 
foreign costumes which made good disguises. One fellow 
wearing turban, jacket, and short loose trousers looked like a 
harmless beggar boy, but he was not harmless. Find his 
likeness in the first column and number it 10. Then read the 
criminal plan he outlined. 
He was speaking in low, incisive tones. ‘The warship sails 
at four o’clock. It carries large stores of ammunition, a 
General, his staff, and a battalion of soldiers besides the crew. 
This is our chance!” A murmur ran through the group. 
One, costumed as a foreign sailor, laughed. Find him in 
column 2, number him 11, and read what he said to his fellow 
conspirators. 
“‘Everything’s arranged,” said the sailor. “We give the 
signal. The rest of you go back to the circus and get ready for 
the performance.” He opened the door and, followed by the 
pretended French officer, slipped into the darkness. John 
followed them along the shore to the harbor shown in the 
picture at the top of the last column. Mark it 12 and read 
what John saw them do. 
The men climbed a tall rock near the shore. John saw the 
gleam of a strong flashlight. It came again. A voice mur- 
mured “Submarine!” and then he understood. He remem- 
154
-P-A-G-E-155
  bered a colt in a nearby pasture; and three minutes later 
John was riding bareback into the night. Silhouette of 
horse and rider appears in column 3. Mark it 13, and read 
how John warned the warship of its danger. 
It was three miles to the government wharf. As he galloped 
John wondered if the submarine would enter the harbor or 
whether it was lying in wait just outside. He heard the sharp 
challenge of a sentry, and with a gasp of relief knew that he 
wasin time. The warship had not yet sailed. Find the picture 
of the vessel in the fourth column, mark it 14, and read how 
John saw the captain. 
John was led before the captain, who listened to his breath- 
less story with amazement. As soon as John finished the 
Captain gave a curt order, and five minutes later, with 
whirring propellers, an airship sailed out over the water, 
loaded with bombs with which to destroy the submarine. A 
picture of the airship is in column 2. Number it 15 and read 
what happened to the spies. 
As the airship started the captain turned again to the boy. 
“The conspirators are hiding, you say, by masquerading as 
circus performers? Go to the office on the wharf. Tell the 
sentinel you are acting by my orders. Telephone police 
headquarters.’’ John obeyed. The instrument he used is in 
column 4. Write 16 by it and continue reading to learn how 
John called the police. 
At first the police laughed. The boyish voice, strained with 
excitement, telephoned an incredible message. Finally, con- 
vinced that the matter was serious, they roused their men and 
in swift motor patrol wagons rushed to the circus grounds. 
The police captain who directed the raid is shown in the last 
column. Number him 17 and read what happened when they 
reached the circus. 
The police surrounded the circus grounds. At a given 
signal they broke into the tents and the conspirators were 
caught red-handed. Still wearing their disguises they were 
rushed to jail and the entire gang was placed under the guard 
155
-P-A-G-E-156
of United States soldiers. The sergeant in charge is pictured 
in the second column. Number him 18 and read what hap- 
pened after the arrests were made. 
Crowds surrounded the jail to see the prisoners. News- 
papers printed John’s picture and told the story of his ad- 
ventures. The General gave him a watch, and the officers 
and sailors whose lives had been saved presented a bag of gold 
to the young hero. A picture of it appears at the bottom of the 
last column. Number it 19 and read the letter of presentation. 
To THE BRAVE YOUTH, WHOSE INTELLIGENCE AND COURAGE 
SAVED a Unrrep States BaTTLESHIP AND THE LIVES OF TWO 
THOUSAND MEN, THIS GOLD IS GRATEFULLY AWARDED. The 
bag held twenty hundred dollars in gold. Write 20 by 19 to 
indicate its contents. The exciting trial at which John was 
chief witness ended with a unanimous verdict of “Guilty.” 
A Dirricutr Picture Suppnement Scape 
At the same time that Picture Supplement Scale 1 was being 
constructed, a companion scale was prepared for testing in the 
same way at a somewhat higher level of vocabulary difficulty. 
The thought of each paragraph, and the difficulty of the re- 
sponse required, were maintained at the same constant level 
as that of the new scale, Picture Supplement Scale 1; but the 
vocabulary used consisted of longer and more difficult words. 
The text of the second scale is reproduced below. 
Dirricutt Picture Supplement ScaLp 
1. With pencil circumscribe a protective frame about the 
accompanying silhouette so that it may be utilized, as profiles 
of Grecian women are so frequently, for a decorative medal- 
lion. Care should be taken that the frame is oval in shape and 
not round, square, or oblong, as might be the case with an 
ordinary portrait. 
2. Draw a cable attached to the basket of this soaring 
balloon with the free end hanging overboard so that should a 
tempest arise it would be possible to moor the balloon while 
156
-P-A-G-E-157
  
waiting for calmer weather; and before completing the sketch 
attach a hook to the end of the cable to represent an anchor 
for use in mooring. 
3. The prevalence of influenza and pneumonia leads this 
woman’s physician to order shoes to prevent exposure in cold 
weather. By blackening the outline drawing represent the 
addition of foot covering. Do this only to one foot, however, 
since the sleepy woman has not had opportunity to complete 
her dressing. 
4, As indication that you understand the significance of 
No., which is a symbol frequently employed in commercial 
occupations, inscribe 4, which denotes the number of this 
paragraph, in the space manifestly intended for it above. 
Make the inscription not in the center but at the right hand 
extremity of the sign. 
5. To shake the poise of this unpleasantly supercilious 
butler outline a large boulder immediately in his course. This 
will almost inevitably cause him to stumble and be precipitated 
headlong; but in order to insure his demoralization draw still 
another a short distance further in front of him. 
6. This fierce dragon moves with incredible rapidity. 
Below is a ponderous individual who dislikes labor. Draw a 
rope from the extremity of the dragon’s tail through the print 
to the handlebars of the bicycle in the illustration below so 
that he will be dragged rapidly along. 
7. The dragon will shortly haul this portly gentleman at 
such excessive speed that a smooth racing track will be 
necessary beneath his wheels to prevent disaster. Proceed 
to make one for him but avoid drawing it behind his machine 
since it is only in the coming ride that he will feel the necessity 
for one. 
8. Santa Claus owns an automobile. Illustrate one possible 
disadvantage by marking with a cross the point of probable 
application should any unscrupulous antagonist desire to halt 
his journey by puncturing the tire of the rear wheel with some 
sharp instrument, such as a tack or piece of glass. 
157
-P-A-G-E-158
  9. The processes of eating would be facilitated for this 
uncomfortably veiled Turkish woman if a small incision were 
made in the veil immediately in front of the organs of masti- 
cation; but since this has not been done lead her to discard 
the veil by making on its surface a large black cross expressive 
of your disapprobation. 
10. If a horse were dragging this ponderous log he would 
be hitched to it by two long leather straps called traces. 
Rapidly draw two such traces firmly attached to the trunk 
but not yet harnessed to any willing horse. Draw them 
fastened to the end of the trunk opposite that on which the 
men are pulling. 
11. This tiny girl is annoyed because her donkey refuses to 
gallop but instead prefers a leisurely promenade at extremely 
slow speed. Draw a cord attached to the upper extremity of 
the stick which she is grasping and extend its length straight 
over her head horizontally for a short distance to provide an 
adequate whip. 
12. This fellow has a keen desire for tobacco and ex- 
periences considerable difficulty in obtaining it. Draw the 
thick cloud of smoke which, after he has investigated the 
resources of the neighborhood and procured the desired 
materials, will shortly be flying upwards over his shoulder 
and streaming out behind him. 
13. The weight this athlete supports over his shoulder is 
excessive and he will not long be able to maintain it. There- 
fore extend a horizontal bar immediately underneath the 
vertical forearm on which the gymnast may rest his elbow. 
Allow the bar to extend across the entire width of the picture 
instead of on one side only. 
14. Without attempting to produce a drawing of artistic 
merit hastily sketch a narrow ribbon attached to the upper 
portion of this beautiful wreath which has been so cleverly 
constructed of mistletoe and holly; and as you do so take care 
to provide two short streamers hanging down through the 
center.

  15. This amusingly strenuous urchin demands an addi- 
tional rod for use in his outdoor sports. Rapidly draw one in 
his free hand, and as you do so direct its slant so that it 
reclines over his shoulder and protrudes behind his head 
instead of paralleling the other rod in front. 
16. Carefully encircle the 22d on this calendar to indicate 
that it is Washington’s birthday and a national holiday. The 
12th is Lincoln’s birthday, and the 14th is the children’s 
festival in memory of St. Valentine. Make a cross on the 
latter date to show that although a festival day it is not a 
legal holiday. 
17. This energetic youth’s specialty is long distance kicking 
and you are required to depict an incident in a recent hotly 
contested game by drawing a properly inflated pigskin ball 
reclining on the turf, instead of soaring lightly upward, to 
show the lamentable lack of precision which made him miss 
his kick. 
18. Write the numbers in order from 1 through 6 beside 
this picture of the sleeping children who are so comfortable 
that they fail to respond to repeated summons. The figures 
are to indicate that the clock has struck six. Now add the 
figure 7 to show that it is seven o’clock before they actually 
rise. 
19. This youngster has surreptitiously procured his elder 
sister’s cherished hat, and is parading down the boulevard. 
As he will not need the umbrella with which he is thoughtfully 
provided cross it out. To do this make two crosses appro- 
priately located upon the handle and one at the extreme lower 
tip. 
20. Since TB is the usual abbreviation for tuberculosis 
print the two initials closely contiguous to this celebrated 
emblem of the American Tuberculosis Association. In doing 
so be careful to select such locations as will result in the 
separation of the initials by the intervention of the emblem 
between them.

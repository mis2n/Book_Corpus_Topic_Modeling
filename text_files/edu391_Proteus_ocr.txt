INTELLIGENCE AND PROTEUS 
THERE seems not to exist a word—for 
words are old while meanings may be 
new—which answers exactly to what 
I shall speak of as Intelligence. But 
space being short for what has to be 
said, I will not waste any in preliminary 
definitions. That which I mean by 
Intelligence will become evident by 
what I expect from its presence and 
attribute to its absence. I start from 
the assumption that it already exists, 
however insufficiently; and I deduce 
from what it has done that its nature 
is to intensify and extend. Whether 
this will be witnessed in the near 
future, or whether it may be checked 
by adverse circumstances, is no concern 
of mine. Writers of this series, and 
[1]
-P-A-G-E-10
PROTEUS 
  several others besides, have enlarged 
on the political and economic con- 
tingencies to which Intelligence, or 
persons presumed to have it, seem 
likely to be exposed. Whether Intelli- 
gence may become the weapon of a 
dominant caste, as was the hope of 
Comte, of Renan, and, at one moment, 
of Mr. H. G. Wells; or whether, as 
proposed by M. Charles Maurras, In- 
telligence shall be honoured with a 
subordinate function in some sort of 
Fascist State, I am inadequate to 
judge. Nor do I even feel certain that 
history has shown, or economic theory 
demonstrated, that Intelligence can be 
bullied or starved out of existence. 
Meanwhile let me confess that what 
I have to say about the Future of In- 
telligence is the expression as much of 
my hopes as of my convictions, both, 
however, arising from a longish experi- 
ence of changes already brought about, 
and changes beginning to be brought 
about, by the particular, and perhaps 
rather modern, something I mean by 
[2]
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
Intelligence. What I mean, and what, 
under restriction to that meaning, ap- 
pears to me likely or desirable. By 
underlining these personal pronouns, I 
am able to forestall the mention of 
one great change which Intelligence is 
already initiating, namely, the recogni- 
tion and avowal that what one thinks 
(as distinguished from what primers, 
manuals and other authorities have 
taught one to believe) is—well, just 
what one does think, and neither the 
consensus of human opinion nor the 
revelation of the Deity’s irrefragable 
truth. 
Returning to the word Intelligence, 
the meaning I attach to it will become 
sooner obvious by clearing away some 
misconceptions thereof which may oc- 
cur to my reader. And first: The In- 
telligence whose future interests me is 
not the same thing as the Intelligentsia. 
Those of us who belong to that class 
presumably possess Intelligence, since 
we live, or try to live, by its exercise. 
But it is no monopoly of ours, nor do 
[3]
-P-A-G-E-12
  PROTEUS 
we always employ it in the manner 
which answers to my meaning. For 
living on or by its employment may, as 
is often seen among men of science and 
philosophers, result in their capital of 
natural Intelligence being sunk in a 
few enterprises of especial value, leav- 
ing them, as in the notorious case of 
Dr. Faust, but a scanty balance for 
current use and pleasure. I have 
brought in the word pleasure because 
the pleasantness of its varied exercise 
is one of the chief characteristics of 
what I mean by Intelligence, fostering 
that nimbleness, elasticity, hence also 
pervasiveness, which makes it a chief 
factor of human progress, as well as 
one of progressive mankind’s indisput- 
able marks and unalienable rewards. 
Now these same pleasant properties, so 
often sacrificed by very studious per- 
sons, turn Intelligence into the stock-in- 
trade (eked out with plentiful surro- 
gates) of that other branch of the 
Intelligentsia, those who make a liveli- 
hood by living down to their readers, 
[4]
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
relieving their boredom, lapping their 
thick skins in sentimentality, and keep- 
ing up the sooty flame of their collective 
passions; for alas, the Man of Letters 
is tempted to serve his public not 
merely as an unconsidered jester but 
as a respected moral guide. 
Thus it comes about that we of the 
Intelligentsia cannot stand as faultless 
specimens of Intelligence. Besides, our 
facility for self-expression and our 
habit of holding forth unchecked com- 
bine to exaggerate, stereotype and warp 
our best ideas: only think. of Carlyle 
and Ruskin, let alone Tolstoy and 
Nietzsche! 
Having so far established what I do 
not mean by Intelligence, and before 
entering on discussion of Intelligence’s 
future achievements, it seems fitting 
to say a word or two about Proteus, 
to whom this little treatise is conse- 
crated. It is so, I confess, partly be- 
cause I am attracted by the classical 
titles, Dedalus, Icarus, Tantalus, of 
my predecessors, and then because, as 
LS
-P-A-G-E-14
PROTEUS 
described by Virgil, Proteus is to me 
one of the most engaging figures of 
mythology: . . . “TIlle, suae contra 
non immemor artis, omnia transformat 
sese in miracula rerum, ignemque, 
horribilem feram, fluviumque liquen- 
tem = 
But here again I must forestall 
another wrong identification likely to 
jump into the reader’s mind: to wit, 
of Proteus with Intelligence. On the 
contrary: Proteus, multiform and ever- 
elusive, represents that which Intelli- 
gence (lighter equipped than specialized 
Intellect for such rapid hunts) can 
sometimes catch sight of and, for how- 
ever brief a contact, sometimes even 
clutch. Proteus, in my mythology, is 
the mysterious whole which we know 
must exist, but know not how to 
descry: Reality. For, whatever else 
we may believe it to be, Reality when 
thus partially revealed, is never twice 
the same. Nor merely because of 
what we call waxing and waning, 
growth and decay, and whatever other 
[6]
-P-A-G-E-15
  
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
phases of individual and racial trans- 
formation biology has made us super- 
ficially familiar with. There may 
well be some xévra p’et outside and 
irrespective of our thoughts; indeed, 
it may have been in miming the uni- 
versal flux that our thoughts them- 
selves have grown protean. Look, for 
instance, at that strange (well named 
auxiliary) verb whereby we testify be- 
lief in reality, esse, to be; which holds 
in its emptiness the possibility of all 
qualities and happenings and implies 
in its assertion of mere blank existence 
the assurance of continual change: a 
future and past. For, whenever we 
speak of what we call a thing, its mere 
name, like the name of Virgil’s Proteus, 
is a spell making us witness aspect 
after aspect, take stock of relation 
after relation, admit likelihood after 
likelihood. And our belief in that 
thing’s reality, in its being that thing 
and no other, means that it has had 
a certain, however unknown, past, and 
will have a more or less certain future. 
[7] 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  PROTEUS 
In this sense Reality, the fact of aspects 
perceived, remembered and expected 
in regularly connected sequences and 
combinations, that is what I mean by 
Proteus. Maybe that Proteus does not 
change at all except in our narrow, and 
shifting, field of vision. Maybe that 
the multiform Virgilian Proteus might 
turn out to undergo but one first and 
last transformation, into that great 
auxiliary esse, to be, holding in its stark 
emptiness all that, for us, is things and 
happenings. . . Such a transcendent 
and sole real Reality I leave to meta- 
physicians, not without wondering 
secretly whence, save from occasional 
experience of this (to them) unreal 
Proteus, they ever got to think about 
Reality at all. 
So, dealing in this shallow treatise 
solely with such (even if spurious) 
Reality as Proteus represents, I need 
now only justify my outrageous claim 
that mere Intelligence can have any 
privileged intercourse therewith. My 
ground for saying so is that specialized 
[8]
-P-A-G-E-17
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
intellect screws its marvellous lenses 
down on only a single, and singled out, 
aspect of Reality; employs subtle 
reagents revealing only the properties 
for which they have been devised. 
Moreover, that the world of regular, 
foretellable sequences which science 
constructs is a map teaching us why 
to turn to the right or the left, but not 
a moving slice of the landscape we are 
moving in. Instead of which mere 
Intelligence, with its rule-of-thumb 
logic and wellnigh automatic move- 
ments, may be fairly fitted, not indeed 
to inventory and schedule separate 
items of Proteus’ multifold embodi- 
ments, but to keep us aware that 
Proteus is there at that eternal game of 
his: changing his aspects perpetually, 
whether you watch him or not, nay, 
changing aspect by the very.fact of 
your watching him. 
This may suggest that Intelligence is 
never at rest; and no more it is. But 
its movements being responsive to what 
strikes it from outside, are, just as the 
[9] 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
PROTEUS 
outside’s own ways, orderly, and such 
as organize themselves into regular 
rhythms of sameness and diversity. 
For Proteus is absolutely unexpected 
only to persons like Virgil’s Aristeeus 
who, you must remember, was so hide- 
bound in his business of honey-making 
(alter one letter, you won’t alter my 
meaning!) as to be wholly unaware 
that his own caddish behaviour had 
occasioned the death of Eurydice and 
so remarkable an event as the Descent 
of Orpheus into Hell. Practical people 
like that are nearly always astonished 
and dismayed when confronted with 
Proteus; “they had forgotten . . .” 
Now Intelligence is as much memory as 
perception; and for it there is always 
in the transformations it is watching 
something familiar which carries it 
back to what it has already witnessed, 
and forwards, expectantly, to something 
it may be going to witness. Hence 
to Intelligence there is never mere 
repetition, just as there is never utter 
novelty. And its frequent doubts are 
[10]
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
always conditioned by its habitual be- 
liefs. That explains why Intelligence 
is so chock-full of prejudices, as all 
those are aware who have ever asked it 
to accept miracles and ghosts on their 
testimony or on someone else’s author- 
ity. Such people exclaim at the sceptic’s 
blindness to evidence, because they 
do not know that doubting and even 
denying are part of Intelligence’s active 
rhythm of grasping and acquiescing; a 
process of assimilation and elimination 
in which the already experienced and 
accepted selects that which shall be 
accepted or rejected. Moreover, such 
selective action often expresses itself 
in the most impertinent (because most 
pertinent) queries, as: “ Now how 
would you explain that?” “In what 
sense are you using that word?” etc., 
etc., etc. Queries, all of them, which 
in their exasperating amateurishness 
have probably done more than the 
elaborate arguments of specialized In- 
tellect to shoo away some of the many 
Chimeras, Entities, and Essences, 
[11] 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  PROTEUS 
which, as Rabelais already remarked, 
had gone on bombinating in vacuo 
through the resounding spaciousness of 
philosophy and science, leaving behind 
only the fainter buzz of Historical and 
Economic Laws, Entelechies, Teleol- 
ogies and Vital Elans. It was, I take 
it, Intelligence which first scoffed in 
Moliére’s play at opium’s Virtus 
Dormitiva. : 
At this point a parenthesis must be 
opened on account of a reader asking, 
not impertinently, whether what I have 
been talking of under the name of 
Intelligence is not plain Common Sense. 
Yes; but also No. Since, on behalf of 
practicality, Common Sense usually 
warns us off from just such questions 
as Intelligence should deal with. So 
one might say that Intelligence is a 
kind of Common Sense, but applied to 
uncommon (not common or garden!) 
subjects, and as yet, alas, only by 
rather uncommon people. 
Tf Proteus be taken to represent that 
Reality which all save metaphysicians 
[12]
-P-A-G-E-21
  
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
believe to be real, he represents especi- 
ally that half of it which I have (else- 
where) called Otherness, that is to say, 
whatever is not ourself. And just as 
the essential, unshareable ourself is 
what we feel, to wit: moods, passions, 
efforts, hope and fear, liking and dis- 
liking; so the not-ourself (other per- 
sons as well as other things, and even 
our own personalities when viewed as if 
they were not our own)—the Otherness 
in short, is, on the contrary, seen, 
because it is outside us. Seen by the 
mental eye of Intelligence, which, like 
the bodily one, moves in every direction 
and focuses to all distances, thereby 
informing us of the proportions and 
relations of whatever is not ourself, and 
following step by step the actions 
which are not our own. And though 
it must borrow the lenses of Science 
(which centuries of thinkers cut and 
polished) before it can know things in 
their microscopic detail or their astro- 
nomical remoteness, yet with no aid 
save everyday experience, Intelligence 
[13]
-P-A-G-E-22
  PROTEUS 
suffices to teach us the most important 
and most overlooked fact concerning 
that Reality which is Otherness: name- 
ly, that it has ways of its own and does 
not exist merely to suit our likings. 
The habit of taking “ otherness” 
into account, and a wider and wider 
circle thereof, might serve as a rough 
test of Intelligence and of its progress: 
young children, as is notorious, re- 
ferring everything to themselves; and 
“uneducated” people, from the nar- 
rowness of their knowledge, rarely con- 
ceiving anything beyond their own 
personal experience. At the risk of 
incurring the same criticism, I hazard 
my own impression that the dominance 
of possessive pronouns, the restriction 
of interest to one’s own history and 
circle of acquaintances, has become less 
usual among “‘ educated ” persons. 
Similarly, that there is getting to be 
something rather old-fashioned about 
settling general questions on the strength 
of single personal experiences. Except 
where strong likes and dislikes come 
[14]
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
into play, it is rarer than formerly 
to hear (shall we say?) divorce con- 
demned because of the sad case of 
Mrs. Blank; or the eight-hours day 
rejected on account of last harvest hav- 
ing been soaked; or the practical utility 
of a classical education justified by 
the career of Mr. Gladstone. Modes of 
thought like this seem to be (slowly!) 
disappearing in the wake of the anec- 
dote-mongering and epigram-and-joke 
button-holing of ancient bores who 
may have been brilliant conversational- 
ists at Meredithian dinner-tables. And 
when one thinks of it: was not such 
the substance of much of our grand- 
parents’ wit and wisdom? Nay, a 
little further back did not “ gentlemen ” 
ask the ladies riddles after themselves 
exchanging smutty Joe Millers over 
their wine? And behold! there opens 
up a vista of euphuism, of pedantic 
discussions, of “sonnet, c’est un son- 
net,” of “delicie eruditorum,” and 
“ facetiee’; boredom incalculable back 
through Hétels de Rambouillets and 
[15]
-P-A-G-E-24
  PROTEUS 
Medicean academies to Courts of Love 
and the stale scurrilities of Shake- 
spearian clowns. . . . Nay, was not 
Shakespeare himself ready to adorn 
with supremest poetry and philosophy 
stories often preposterously cock-and- 
bull? Which makes one suspect that 
Intelligence, in the sense in which I 
have been using the word, is of amaz- 
ingly recent growth; and that the 
people of the past, superior though 
they may have been in genius, wit, 
humour, and even wisdom, would have 
struck us (and we shall doubtless 
strike future generations) as decidedly 
stupid. 
For instance (returning to Proteus!), 
in their capacity of thinking in terms 
of change. . This seems an intrinsic part 
of thinking in terms of otherness; yet, 
as, a fact, it dates only from the days 
of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Gibbon and 
Condorcet. This last name brings 
home that until the eighteenth century 
the only Future which people thought 
about was the Future in Heaven or 
[16]
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
Hell. The importance of the latter 
alternative explains quite sufficiently 
why no interest was left over for any 
other after-life, to wit, that of unborn 
generations. Indeed, the sway of re- 
ligious conceptions accounts also for 
our ancestors having been no less cut 
off from the Past and replacing it 
(as their painters dressed Abraham or 
Cesar in Renaissance costume) by the 
Present. For all religion tends to 
think sub specie eternitatis, as of the 
god who is sacrificed afresh at every 
celebration, and who consecrates the 
routine of the seasons and the seasonal 
monotony of agriculture and pastoral 
life; whence, no doubt, the persistence 
of the amazing fallacy that there is 
nothing new under the sun, with its 
corollary that there ought to be nothing 
not old. Whence also the double 
superstition (till Science broke in with 
something different!) of chewing and 
rechewing the cud of Scripture and the 
Classics. With, in turn, the practical 
results that Milton’s Puritans modelled 
[17]
-P-A-G-E-26
Se eee 
PROTEUS 
themselves on Joshua and Gideon; and 
frilled and waistcoated French Revolu- 
tionaries postured as heroes of Plutarch. 
Why, at this very moment do we not 
see the rods and axes of antique hang- 
men figuring (not merely in figurative 
manner!) as emblems of post-war Italy, 
itself identified (to the neglect of 
schools and irrigation works) with a 
particularly high and palmy Rome? 
Rome! to rule which squalid medizval 
village Dante called on a Cesar who was 
a Kaiser elected by German feudatories ; 
Rome, which we may take as a reductio 
ad absurdum of the refusal to realize 
that Past is Past and Present is Present. 
Which is perhaps the only “ Lesson of 
History ” ; and whose application would 
dissolve many mythical alloys of con- 
flicting nations welded together by the 
passionate white-heat of a name: Eng- 
land, France, America, Christianity, 
and nowadays, I fear, also Socialism, 
nations, and creeds concerning which, 
when asked for our allegiance, we 
have need to inquire: In which of its 
[18]
-P-A-G-E-27
a 
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
phases, which of its characteristics and 
embodiments ? 
For Intelligence warns us that we 
are dealing with Proteus, with him 
of ceaseless change. Not with the 
eternal, immutable divinities to whom 
our forebears brought their some- 
times quaint and lovely, but, quite 
as often, obscene and grisly ob- 
lations. 
But while ignoring distinctions 
between Past and Present, even our 
nearer ancestors conducted much of 
their thinking in elaborate water-tight 
compartments; for they conceived of 
“Truth” as a battleship, continually 
exposed to the murderous broadsides 
of “Error.” Of these hermetic 
partitions, say, between Faith and 
Reason, Body and Soul, or Good and 
Evil, Intelligence has already rammed 
in a number, without drowning us. 
Error itself has lost its capital E, being 
usually called Mistake. And, what 
is more important, we have begun to 
notice that it and Truth are not at all 
[19] 
Library

-P-A-G-E-28
  PROTEUS 
irreconcilable, but cradled originally 
together, and sometimes intermarrying, 
with mixed or alternating generations, 
as by Mendelian rules; but very rarely, 
either Truth or Error, affording us a 
pure breed. 
These examples will have justified, 
I trust, my contention that Intelligence 
is specially fitted to deal with Change. 
Not to praise or blame it after mature 
deliberation, like solemn and sedentary 
Reason; still less to filter concrete 
realities into immutable, because purely 
abstract, entities, which is the business 
of scientific thought; but just to per- 
ceive change on its passage and in so 
far help us to make the best of its 
coming. 
Need one add that Intelligence is 
far more liable to mistakes than either 
“ Reason” or “ Logic”? But its mis- 
takes, though so much more numer- 
ous, are, methinks, less massively en- 
throned and less likely to block the 
way than theirs, for there is something 
self-satisfied and without appeal about 
[20 ]
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
“Reason” and “ Logic’: does not 
the one issue “‘ dictates” and the other 
enunciate “laws”? Whereas the mis- 
takes which Intelligence commits to- 
day, it will, in its light-hearted way, 
correct to-morrow, being as little 
ashamed of revokes as its disconcerting 
friend Proteus is of transformations. 
Of course, Intelligence is rather irre- 
sponsible and, one might add, cannot 
help being so because it is essentially 
responsive. Like the human eye (to 
which I have compared it) Intelligence 
turns to whichever side the light comes 
from, adjusting itself, in discursive, 
often desultory fashion, to all manner 
of directions and distances, comparing 
and measuring with unabashed sloven- 
liness, extracting the qualities which 
strike it and hastening on to connect 
them with something it was struck by 
before. Being thus rapidly responsive, 
Intelligence may often, I admit, seem 
on the pounce, and more so than polite- 
ness warrants. But it can also take its 
time, poise circling round and round, 
[21]
-P-A-G-E-30
  PROTEUS 
and reverse its movement, because it is 
never motionless and always able to 
readjust its balance. 
Such do I see Intelligence in those 
who possess it; such do I feel it, on 
some delightful occasions, in myself. 
Such also I frequently notice it failing 
to make itself agreeable to some kinds 
of persons. Those who take a just 
pride in Reason or Logic are often a 
little ruffled; or else, as Wagner said 
of Mozart, they find Intelligence just 
a little frivol. But in the long run 
they recognize an ally; and their 
conscious superiority makes them 
indulgent. Not so with people—I 
might have said Peoples—who happen 
to be indulging in the glorious 
unimpeded violence of collective 
passions, specially those which are mag- 
nanimous and cruel, as, for instance, 
in war time, when a conscientious 
objector may come off better than an 
intelligent one. 
In like fashion Intelligence’s passion- 
ate pleasure in dealing with Otherness 
[22]
-P-A-G-E-31
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
and in looking out for Proteus, 
Intelligence’s frequent indifference to 
here and now, disrespect to self and 
refusal to regard means as ends—all 
this renders it unpopular with those 
practical-minded men who are bent on 
personal advantage and on outstripping 
competitors in the great race to No- 
where. These acute persons are quite 
aware that Intelligence might make 
an invaluable slave, only you cannot 
keep its nose, with any regularity, to 
the grindstone. In default of such 
practical usefulness it may be worth 
hiring, as one buys a yacht or an old 
master, for a mark of wealth and being 
in the know. But let us have none of 
your whys and wherefores! Besides, 
the Rulers of Men have by this time 
mostly recognized that Intelligence is 
harder to deal with than any number 
of High Principles, for you cannot 
hope to bamboozle it into serving you 
unawares. 
But Intelligence, though thus in 
some quarters deservedly unpopular is 
[23] 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  PROTEUS 
adored by all who have it; and that 
is the reason why, once it has got a 
footing in the world, it is bound to 
increase and multiply and eventually 
conquer its promised land.

PROTEUS AND ETHICS 
I HAVE just come across a passage from 
Huxley’s famous Romanes Lecture, 
read thirty years ago and long since for- 
gotten; and which has brought home 
to me all our elusive Proteus has been 
doing in the domain of ethics ; moreover 
the share of Intelligence in confirming 
those changes. Huxley is pointing out 
a fact which he finds disconcerting, 
namely, “that ethical nature, while 
born of cosmic nature, is necessarily 
at enmity with its parent.” The 
allusion to the harmony reigning in 
Victorian families may make one 
smile, like some well-bred Du Maurier 
illustration. But how those words 
bring back what some of us are old 
enough to have suffered in days when 
[25]
-P-A-G-E-34
  PROTEUS 
Free Thought drew a terrifying line 
between religious dogmas and moral 
ones, clinging to these to steady itself 
after jettisoning the others! One’s 
youthful deistic anguish (as cruel, per- 
haps, as any believer’s sense of God’s 
forsaking him) at discarding God for 
insufficient morality, was merely trans- 
ferred to one’s terms with Huxley’s 
ogre Cosmos, devouring the moral in- 
stincts itself had begotten. Occupied as 
my studies then were with art-history, 
I can remember wrestling with the 
horrid inconsistency of the art of 
Michael Angelo and Rafael having 
arisen in a civilization described by 
Taine as partaking of the brothel and 
the cut-throat’s den. And I remember 
the heavenly relief of hitting on the 
notion that, since such art is not born 
in a day, it must have been begotten 
and incubated during the Franciscan 
Age, immune from all Borgian infec- 
tions. Of course, the generation 
immediately younger than mine was 
taught by Nietzsche that Michael

Angelo’s greatness was, on the contrary, 
due to presiding Renaissance villainy; 
but that pseudo-Nietzschian generation 
is, in its turn, superannuated, and the 
cult of immoralism along with it. Not 
only because paradoxes do not bear 
repetition, but for another reason which 
that quotation from Huxley has made 
me realize. Namely, that we have left 
off thinking of art as either moral or 
immoral, simply because morality no 
longer holds the same place in our 
thoughts as, say, in those of Ruskin, 
George Eliot, or, as that quotation 
shows, even in those of Huxley. Not 
the same (if onemay say so, ubiquitous) 
place; a place more clearly defined, 
but only the more important, ever since 
Intelligence, ferreting about among 
Golden Boughs, Religion of the Semites, 
and similar books, has quietly stripped 
from our moral valuations that half- 
supernatural, half-zsthetic halo which 
is but the shrunken religious involu- 
crum wherein they came into the 
world, The “problem of evil” has 
[27]
-P-A-G-E-36

already become the problem not of its 
toleration by God, but of its diminution 
by Man. That is the great change we 
are still witnessing; a change, I cannot 
but think, greater than any brought 
about by the material applications of 
science, and implying a deliverance 
from individual suffering not less than 
that we owe to Pasteur and to Lister. 
Whether we notice it or not, Morality 
is already taking a new status, inde- 
pendent alike of an absentee (or absent) 
Deity, and of an indifferent Cosmos. 
But its new domain, narrow and self- 
governing, essentially sui generis, has 
sanctions and imperatives only the 
stronger for being man-made and man- 
regarding. And, one may add, only 
the more austerely binding on the 
present that we shall recognize them as 
different from those of the Past and 
different, no doubt, from those into 
which the Future will transform them. 
Thus we are already conceiving of 
punishment only as a mechanism, 
successful or not, for social defence. 
[28]
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE   
And we scarcely ever hear more than 
the last echo of those incentives to 
virtue and deterrents from vice of the 
Sandford and Merton type of my own 
childhood’s copybooks. Still less of 
the Stoical, and (alas!) Platonic 
mendacities about remorse torturing 
evil-doers, and the unhappy life of 
Browning’s Instans Tyrannus with his 
“Then I was afraid.” Neither do we 
talk any longer of the virtuous glows 
which (failing the increase of flocks 
and herds!) used to reward the virtu- 
ous acts of the generation adorned by 
Butler’s Mr. Pontifex. We are getting 
to think of our own virtues, supposing 
we have any, as conducive not to our 
own advantage but to that of other 
folk. 
Consonantly with the psychologist’s 
recognition that, of the two polar 
feelings determining human action, the 
(positive) attraction of pleasure is far 
less potent than the (negative) repulsion 
of pain, it seems as if our future ethics 
would emphasize not good actions but 
[29]
-P-A-G-E-38
  PROTEUS 
bad ones. That will be following up 
the rule-of-thumb wisdom of the Com- 
mandments, of which the surviving 
ones are all “thou shalt not”; the 
positive ones about loving God and 
honouring Father and Mother having 
become either difficult to enforce or 
optional. I am glad of that word 
optional, because it leads to the remark 
that Intelligence is surely abolishing 
that neutral territory whence “ good 
actions ” can issue at “ good” people’s 
good pleasure and as an expression of 
their goodness, but which no one has 
a right to insist upon; indeed, which 
they have a perfect right to withhold, 
since they are patted on the back for 
doing them, or have their hands kissed, 
as children were taught to kiss those of 
the “revered author of their being.” 
I expect that before so very long 
Intelligence may bluntly suggest that 
if the action, whatever it happen to be, 
is really good, that must mean that it is 
really needed ; and if it is really needed, 
your fellow men can claim it and oblige 
[30]
-P-A-G-E-39
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE   
you to claim it from your unwilling 
self. And to dishonour that claim 
may become in their eyes (mirrored 
in your own), mean, disgraceful, dirty. 
In the language of contemporary youth, 
it will not be decent... That substitu- 
tion of the word decency for the word 
virtue gives, methinks, the clue to the 
future revaluation of our moral stand- 
ards. It implies, as I have suggested, 
a more intelligent and, in some ways, 
more indulgent, morality; but a moral- 
ity on the whole more austere, a stark 
notion of duty armed with the relentless 
imperative which nowadays makes us 
abashed at the revelation in ourself 
of physical cowardice or bodily dirti- 
ness. A morality, I venture to add, 
eventually able to do without the adorn- 
ments coming under the head of “‘ Moral 
Beauty.” 
And, speaking of a future standard of 
“ decency,” there will necessarily come 
+“No, we may not be as moral as they (i.e. 
the older generation) are, but we are fifty times 
decenter.”—G, B. Stern, Tents of Israel, 1924;

sundry revaluations quite intolerable 
to our present morality. I will not 
speak (since far too much is nowadays 
being spoken concerning what, after 
all, is but a small part of conduct) 
about such revaluations of sexual morals 
as Dedalus prognosticates from trans- 
plantation of ovaries. That, and com- 
ing facilitations for changing one’s sex, 
cannot, indeed, fail to modify family 
arrangements; although I have greater 
belief in the effects of future methods 
of producing and exchanging, not off- 
spring, but other commodities, and 
the consequent alteration in our tenure 
and conception of property. Indissol- 
uble marriage, which already strikes 
some of us as scarcely decent, will lose 
its practical utility once inheritance is 
more or less abolished, and the sub- 
sistence and education of children no 
longer a charge on parents. Nor is this 
all: a more restricted practice and 
therefore habitual notion of ownership 
may at some distant day educate men 
and women, parents and children,

lovers and friends, nay, masters and 
disciples, to admit Proteus even into 
the impregnable stronghold and in- 
violable sanctuary of human selfish- 
ness called Love. The “ marriage of 
true minds” may, like the other one, 
come to be supplemented by honour- 
able divorce. Exclusive reciprocal 
attachment, surely of all spiritual 
essences the most delicate, if not most 
volatile, may cease to be regarded 
as an inalienable piece of property, 
guaranteed by honour more terrible 
than law; and which, while all else 
(and ourselves most!) alters and shifts, 
cannot be altered and shifted without 
guilt of theft. There may come an 
end to the ideal of such fidelity as 
implies the claim of him or her once 
preferred to be preferred for ever; the 
duty also of continuing to prefer once 
having begun. Like much of the 
morality of a more intelligent age, 
“decent” behaviour in matters of 
sentiment will be based less upon an 
ought than an is. And I can conceive 
[33] 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  
PROTEUS 
that such a change may make love’s 
tenure less insecure and less routinish 
and perfunctory. It will, at least, save 
one of the finest kinds of happiness 
(and the multiplying factor of many 
other ones) not indeed from the passing 
misery of change, but from the igno- 
miny of claimed or accepted sacrifice, 
and the cruel pollution of jealousy, not 
between lovers only, but between all 
who love. And when there shall be 
applied to love the solemn saying “‘ the 
Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away ” 
we may learn to temper our loss by the 
intenser gratitude for whatever, even 
if only for a time, has been ours. 
As with fidelity in love, so also with 
“loyalty” to persons, even to causes 
and ideas. But such, too often de- 
grading, loyalty will, I imagine, be 
more than compensated for by the con- 
demnation of a new sin against the 
Holy Ghost, and by insistence on a 
minimum (at least!) of consistency in 
one’s own ideas and a minimum of 
conformity between one’s judgment of 
[34]
-P-A-G-E-43
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
others and one’s judgment of oneself: 
the mote in one’s brother’s eye awaken- 
ing the suspicion of the beam in one’s 
own. 
At the same time (which is not our 
time!), and as Intelligence takes on a 
leading part in morals, there will come 
the indulgent recognition that such a 
“decency” as we may exact (or try 
to exact) from ourselves, cannot, any 
more than personal cleanliness in our 
own day, be exacted from all our 
neighbours. It may take a good many 
transformations of Proteus before the 
mote can always be removed from our 
brother’s eye, even supposing the beam 
to have been taken away from our own. 
It is no easy matter to be always clean 
inside and out, especially when, like 
the little boy in Stevenson’s rhyme, 
“your dear Papa is poor,’ poor in 
spirit, perchance one of a long line of 
moral paupers. Neither is “ decency” 
always attainable where there has been 
no past charwoman to prepare your 
easy tidiness at expense of previous

-P-A-G-E-44
  
PROTEUS 
dirty hands. Still less when, as now- 
adays, wallowing in excess or in cruelty 
is the only excitement many people 
can get out of life. Hence it may bea 
long while yet before the bare decencies 
of the spirit, even if recognized for 
such, can lose the value of rarity and the 
status of virtues. For, let us remember 
that, the fouler mankind’s surroundings 
and sores, the greater the need for 
incense and myrrh and even for the 
questionable odour of sanctity. Is not 
early Christianity’s, say St. Paul’s, 
insistence on chastity and mansuetude 
the expression of the otherwise in- 
expressible bestiality, cruelty, and vain- 
gloriousness of decadent Rome? And 
what is the foolish Franciscan laudation 
of beggary save the measure of me- 
dizeval rapine and simony? 
So, for the time being and the world 
as it may, alas! long continue, mankind 
will need something besides a taste for 
moral decency, to wit, an admiration 
for generous, nay, quixotic impulses 
and for tender sensibilities. These

Intelligence, respectful towards the 
need for them, can neither create, nor, 
except by negative measures, even 
increase. But it can do something 
as necessary. Intelligence, and only 
Intelligence, can see to it that, even 
to-day, such rare and precious impulses 
and sensibilities be not diverted to evil 
results, wasted in barren self-sacrifice, 
or the fostering of hide-bound selfish- 
ness. Wasted, above all, in heca-

superstition, like the one which is

PROTEUS AND AESTHETICS 
“Tr there be any truth in these fore- 
casts of what your fine Intelligence 
may bring about or justify in the 
domain of ethics, then” (it’s a certain 
kind of reader interrupting), “then 
may I never enter, nay, cast a glance 
into this detestable world of rational- 
ized righteousness! Human do you call 
it, because you have made it godless? 
What is this Intelligence of yours 
worth if it fails to perceive that God 
exists because Man has need of Him; 
and that the true mission of virtue, of 
truth, of heroism, is not to make the 
world more endurable, but to satisfy 
our deepest human craving, that for 
greater harmony and loveliness, for 
deeper, steadier passion than otherwise 
life affords? ” 
[38]
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
My answer is that such a craving will 
become stronger, or at least wider- 
spread, in proportion as mankind grows 
more intelligent, therefore less exhaust- 
ed by struggling against adverse circum- 
stances, inbred defects and inherited 
superstitions. In proportion, likewise, 
as it will have learned to value its own 
virtues as they can minister to man’s 
prosperity and betterment. Nay, more: 
the time will come when we shall 
turn with disgust and wrath at their 
cultivation for any other purpose; and 
when pleasure in virtue and in hero- 
ism for its own sake may come to be 
accounted so much esthetic dilettant- 
ism, questionable and well-nigh obsolete. 
For with the orientation of morals 
towards human usefulness, towards 
dutifulness conceived as decency, people 
will get to understand that what man 
craves for as consolation and enhance- 
ment, the passion deeper and steadier, 
the harmony more complete than real 
life furnishes, Man creates for himself 
in poetry and art, and in the things of 
[39]
-P-A-G-E-48
  PROTEUS 
reality seen as poetry and art. In all 
this he has made himself a realm whtre 
truth is never betrayed, because in its 
sheer existence true and false become 
words without a meaning; moreover, 
where the deepest and highest passions 
are satisfied without being misapplied 
or wasted, because satisfied by their 
mere expression. Art and whatever 
the poor word Art may stand for—is 
the man-made sanctuary of the legiti- 
mate, the innocent, the immaculately 
decent, because it is closed to the shift- 
ing needs, the partial truths, above 
all, the mine and thine, which trouble 
real life. This, in its way, is also a 
realm of otherness, inasmuch as it 
transcends the self with its here and its 
now. Yet an otherwise not merely 
recognized by Intelligence, but made 
by the heart’s desire out of the heart’s 
own substance and in desire’s own 
shape; for of such are the forms of 
the painter and sculptor, no less than 
the counterfeit presentments of the 
poet. Above all, in the twin arts of

architecture and of music do we already 
meet the clarified embodiment of the 
longing and clinging, the solemn ap- 
peasement and victorious stress and 
fulfilment of human passion. Here, in 
art’s interludes of life, we can obtain 
what religious creeds lay open to the 
reproach of being false because they 
give it for true; and what love seeks 
to make unchanging, only to taste the 
bitterness of change. So that many as 
have been and will be the successive 
responses to our esthetic cravings, the 
manifold satisfactions thereof, embody- 
ing as they do the purified essence of 
our feelings and activities, will, in the 
endless shifting of our valuations, per- 
haps_constitute the one region where 
we need not be watching for Proteus.

PROTEUS AND INTELLECTUAL 
MANNERS 
THouGH many other causes will bring 
about such moral revaluations as I have 
mentioned, Intelligence will play its 
part in justifying them. But Intelli- 
gence will itself effectuate great changes, 
methinks, in the minor moral realm of 
intellectual manners. For instance, 
proscribing perfunctoriness; making us 
ashamed, which we are not, of offering 
in the guise of opinion much which we 
know to be stop-gap and shoddy. 
The condemnation of perfunctoriness 
will lead to discarding heckler’s tricks 
and dialectic pit-falls like that con- 
cerning the future status of the widow 
of seven successive husbands, where- 
with the Sadducees, though disbelieving 
in any after-life at all, tried to trip up

Jesus. His answer: that there would 
be neither marrying nor giving in 
marriage, may stand as the typical 
silencer to many queries with which 
debaters embarrass each other without 
advancing a step in the inquiry. For 
instance: “ then, what do you propose 
to do?” Well! we may be intelligent 
enough to know that in nine cases out 
of ten there is nothing to propose. 
Since the more habitually we get to 
regard the Future as resulting from the 
Present and the Present from the Past, 
the more often we must admit that we 
know too little of the hidden Past, and 
less of the fleeting Present, to make 
sure what new combinations, including 
reciprocal neutralizations, are preparing 
to arise. The oftener we have watched 
the Old Man Proteus, the less, per- 
haps, our cocksureness about his next 
metamorphosis. Or, take another ques- 
tion which intellectual good breeding 
will refrain from because Intelli- 
gence foresees no answer: “In that 
case, what will you put in its place?” 
[43]
-P-A-G-E-52

It being, let us say, indissoluble mar- 
riage, exclusive private ownership, war 
(you remember William James was, 
shortly before 1914, looking out for a 
surrogate!) or even what used to be 
called God, but may now be thankful 
when philosophers (like Mr. Lloyd 
Morgan) allow it merely adjectival 
rank as “ Deity.” How do you know 
that it, whatever it is, will leave a place? 
Do we not daily see that, when things 
vanish, their place (place in the world, 
in our thoughts, and also, in our 
hearts!) are apt to vanish along with 
them and be forgotten? And among 
such things as may some day vanish 
and be forgotten there will, I trust, 
be the dialectic ju-jitsu which makes 
many pages even of Plato such dreary 
reading. Lacking, as the world then 
did, all discipline of experimental 
science, such acrobatics may have 
afforded an indispensable training to 
logical thought, and a preparation for 
that latest-comer of all intellectual 
habits: care for the exact sense in

which a word is being employed. 
Apart, however, from this, controversy 
of this kind has but a personal value, 
adding nothing to knowledge, just as 
nothing is added to wealth when one 
gamester loses money to another: the 
personal value of downing an adversary 
and magnifying oneself by mere com- 
parison, which may be reckoned in some 
distant Future an intellectual entertain- 
ment fit for cads. 
Such are a few of the improvements 
one might foresee in our intellectual 
manners. Allied with these is one 
which appertains to our intellectual 
morals. In another book’ I have 
written at some length against the 
survival of the lawyer’s and politician’s 
arts of Persuasion, and of the priestly 
arts of Exhortation and Denunciation, 
both sets of them intended to influence 
men to think, feel and act differently 
from how they would otherwise do, 
but in compliance with the persuasive 
person’s wishes. Some day or other

such attempts may be accounted 
impertinent where they fail, and dis- 
honest where they succeed; they and 
the sway of words should constitute a 
chapter of intellectual morals. 
Returning to mere _ intellectual 
manners, I think intellectual prize 
fights, duels and vendettas, such as 
wasted half the life of the greatest 
intellects from Abélard to Samuel 
Butler, are a little going out of fashion, 
like the quarrels for precedence we 
read about in Herbert of Cherbury 
and such-like: they stop the traffic, 
make a noise and, after a minute, bore 
us! Moreover, I fancy I see a reason 
why, let alone mere spectators of such 
frays, even those who might have been 
principals in them will refrain and call 
them ill-mannered. I mean that, as 
people grow more intelligent, or more 
people grow intelligent at all, we shall 
discover other opportunities for exer- 
cising intellectual energy and for ob- 
taining the thrill and uplift of intellec- 
tual prowess. There will appear other

ourselves down asses as we try to make

is hunting Proteus. . . 
Nor will I let myself be heckled with 
the objection that joys like these are 
reserved for minds like yours and mine, 
dear reader, minds Creative. 
As if books, pictures, policies, opinions, 
etc., etc., were created ex nihilo, obey- 
ing that august fiat which evolutional 
philosophy has filched from the old 
Creator of all things to bestow on every 
member of the Intelligentsia. No, no, 
the joys I speak of are unprofessional. 
And the chief creative joy is that of 
understanding and appreciating; say 
the joy of every deserving reader out- 
running the straight path of the writer 
in circles like those of a dog pleased to 
be taken a walk. 
Amateurishness! I can hear those 
of you pshah! and tosh! who believe

in training the (involuntary) attention 
and who value work less by results 
than by efforts. Amateurish? Why, 
of course, that’s just the fun and the 
good of it. Also the unsought moral 
gain. For, are we not made more 
“ decent” by these private, irresponsi- 
ble dealings with the Unknown (at 
least to us); for instance, those secret 
inaccurate guesses at geological and 
historical riddles which make up half 
the pleasure of a journey? Since these 
amateurish stalkings of Proteus attain 
an attractiveness such that personal 
controversy seems insipid or odious by 
comparison. 
I have had the good fortune once or 
twice, even in an old-fashioned lifetime, 
to witness the full flowering of such 
selfless intellectual happiness: to watch 
a mind so passionately interested in 
certain subjects as to care nothing 
whether the enchanting new ideas were 
its own or other folks’; nay, whether 
its own were by them confirmed or 
utterly demolished. I have seen that 
[48]

unusual spectacle, but once or twice 
only. For Intelligence has yet to 
establish its claim to such generous 
happiness. Once or twice only. But 
never more clearly have I seen it than 
in you, Mario Calderoni, dear dead 
young friend, who have embodied my

USES AND ABUSES 
ConsIDERING the great pleasantness, 
let alone the various uses, of the 
mental habits I have summed up as 
Intelligence, it is surprising there should 
not yet be more of it forthcoming. It 
has, at present, a way of giving out 
suddenly in individuals and nations, 
just when its mixture of light-hearted 
scepticism and steady hopefulness would 
seem most needed. By which inade- 
quacy of its supply I am confirmed in 
the suspicion that Intelligence is a 
much more recent human accomplish- 
ment than the Past’s other achieve- 
ments in art and poetry and wit and 
humour would lead us to expect. 
Indeed, the deserved prestige of that 
Past, and the consequent survival of 
[50] 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
its educational and religious traditions 
and institutions, is very likely what has 
so strangely delayed the advent of 
modern Intelligence. And it is their 
dwindling, itself partly attributable 
to nascent Intelligence, which has 
delivered our intellectual activities from 
sundry blind alleys and sloughs of 
despond, like those presided over by 
the terrible, and most unintelligent, 
word Salvation. For Intelligence, one 
of whose virtues is abolishing Fear, is 
itself stifled by the obsession of danger 
in this world or the next: are we not 
seeing the most naturally intelligent of 
all countries fallen into incredible self- 
defeating stupidity through its present 
mania for “Security”? It is, of 
course, evident that, apart from the 
decay of religious and classical super- 
stition, the growth of Intelligence in our 
own days has been enormously fostered 
by increase both of scientific knowledge 
and of civic liberty, and also, as far as 
it goes, of well-being; also of oppor- 
tunities for variety of impression at 
bsrl
-P-A-G-E-60
  PROTEUS 
least for the well-to-do classes. And 
one hopes there may be other kinds of 
yet unforeseen novelties coming to 
Intelligence’s assistance in the Future. 
Yet, the chief obstacles once removed, 
my hope is chiefly in what one might 
call Intelligence’s own natural pro- 
liferation. One intelligent mode of 
thought inevitably leads to another, 
and puts out of action an unintelligent 
one. Every intelligent book adds, let 
us hope, to the intelligence of at least 
one reader; so that we could almost 
do without the tremendous launchings- 
forth of the great challengers, Ruskin, 
Tolstoi, Ibsen, Nietzsche; even of the 
more purely beneficent (because lighter- 
hearted) stirrers-up of thought like 
Bernard Shaw. 
Believing, therefore, in such spon- 
taneous multiplication of Intelligence, 
I do not find much use for the methods, 
whereof that one is but an extreme 
example which is attributed to the late 
Dr. Metchnikoff, proposing (it is said) 
to increase the output of genius by

judicious doses of syphilitic virus. 
Surely, the supply of raw genius would 
be fairly adequate if only we could put 
it to the best use? And the best use 
of genius is not, in my opinion, the 
practical application of science to 
methods of reciprocal slaughter and 
devastation. Nor even its application 
to easier locomotion, intercourse and 
the cheapening of food, heat and light, 
except to the extent which would secure 
more health, more leisure and more 
opportunity all round; certainly at 
present not the case. And, speaking 
for myself, the best use of genius and 
the most necessary application of 
science, seems to be teaching people 
what Descartes called (whatever his 
precise meaning) the méthode de bien 
conduire son esprit; at least to the 
slight degree of not letting obsolete 
shibboleths. and new-fangled catch- 
words carry us, as they did ten years 
ago, headlong into the disasters we 
were trying to avoid. 
The next best thing to be done with

our existing supply of genius might be 
to train it to check, by application of

certain ailments inherent in its own 
constitution, namely : exaggeration, con- 
trariness and, of course, megalomania. 
Such self-purification, on the part of 
persons of genius or what passes for 
such, would save the rest of us the 
disheartening task of throwing half of 
their sayings onto the scrap-heap, and 
of picking out of the scrap-heap some 
of the sayings of rival persons of genius 
consigned thereunto at their bidding. 
There is quite enough to be done in 
the way of selection, assimilation and 
elimination (since all understanding 
means that) without setting such Intel- 
ligence as we have to play scavenger to 
wasteful or slatternly genius. ‘ 
And -yet, and yet. . . . May not 
those trashinesses of genius, and the 
scavengering entailed thereby, be that 
which secures to Intelligence its highest 
activities, and in so far fulfils one of 
Genius’s chief missions? For, after

all, Intelligence is the living, changing 
mass of unprofessional thought, the 
averaged, habitual thought of the 
majority of us. And is not the chief 
use of all such genius as is not set 
aside in science or in art, rather to make 
the rest of us think, than to furnish us 
with ready-made thoughts, however 
true or sublime? Nay, I would hazard 
the supposition that it was because the 
men of the Past were presented with 
such a mass of ready-made thoughts, 
creeds, philosophies, and moral formule 
(think of Deuteronomy!) all given for 
perfect and definitively valid, that 
there did not appear till so late in the 
day just what I have called Intelligence, 
which alone could give that without 
which the greatest genius is solitary and 
barren: an audience, a reader, a mind 
able to carry on the thinking and, in 
so far, able to eliminate the deciduous, 
the rubbishy elements of the thought 
already offered to it. 
The consideration of this loss which 
mankind may have suffered through the

notion that thoughts must be accepted 
ready-made rather than transformed 
into one’s own, and that, consequently, 
men must be set apart to do the think- 
ing (as the priests once did the praying 
and sacrificing) for others; this con- 
sideration is at the bottom of my present 
hatred of the idea (which I shared in 
my youth) that exceptionally gifted 
persons should consecrate themselves 
into a caste, ministers, maybe, of a new 
religion, chosen vessels for a new- 
fangled deity. 
And since we are discussing the 
reciprocal uses of Genius and of mere 
Intelligence (Genius ever stimulating 
Intelligence, Intelligence ever keeping 
Genius within the bounds of sense and 
of decency), allow me to set my face 
against all those oligarchies of genius 
and virtue which every Utopian phi- 
losopher from Plato to Comte, from 
Renan to H. G. Wells, has wanted to 
foist on dull, driven Mankind. And let 
us take to heart the reductio ad 
absurdum of all such schemes in the

latest and hugest joke of our one great 
laughing philosopher, when he shows 
us the world governed by bald, tooth- 
less and passionless sages, who, even 
without having reached the years of 
Methuselah, have long survived the 
age when every decent person should 
retire to his or her coffin. 
And before leaving the subject of the 
services (sometimes scarcely desired) 
which Genius may need at the humble 
hands of Intelligence, let me point out 
how our men of genius or thereabouts 
(‘Creative Intellects” is the official 
expression) have latterly taken over 
one of the most remunerative and 
mischievous employments of all ob- 
solete priesthoods, to wit: of frighten- 
ing believers with bogies of their 
manufacture. For, just as the Tor- 
ments of Hell and the Pitfalls of Sin 
formerly supplied matter for all the 
learning and eloquence of centuries of 
Divines, so nowadays encyclopedic 
science and journalistic emphasis are 
being applied to making our flesh creep

with prophecies of Perils. There is 
Peril from black, brown, yellow races; 
from Semites, Mongols, Latins (in 
“Nordic” countries), Teutons (in 
Latin countries), Celts all over Anglo- 
Saxondom, Jews throughout the globe; 
Bolsheviks, Fascists and Junkers, Inter- 
national Communism and International 
Finance, Militarism which was put an 
end to by the War, besides our old, 
friends Jesuits and Freemasons. There 
is Peril from the multiplication of Idiots 
and the multiplication of Supermen; 
Peril from depopulation and Peril from 
overpopulation, from unsexed women 
and over-sexed women; Peril from 
over-much altruism, and Peril from in- 
sufficient altruism. Perils which I can- 
not even remember, but by whose side 
those of War, Pestilence and Famine 
are, of course, too familiar to be noticed. 
Indeed, it is characteristic of this latter- 
day apocalypse that none of the prophets 
of disaster prophesied the War and the 
Fruits of Victory, except, if I remember 
correctly, Mr. H. G. Wells, who, how-

ever, once the War had been declared, 
enlisted at once for the Fleet Street 
Front and bid us unsheath the Sword 
of Peace for the final extermination of 
Militarisms =) 252 
Therefore, it strikes me that in view 
of this multifold reincarnation of the 
spirit of prophecy in our Men of Sci- 
ence and of Letters, some increase of 
Intelligence may well be needed to 
steady our nerves and allow us to recog- 
nize the real dangers of which, heaven 
knows, there are plenty requiring to be 
faced with . . . well, the far-too- 
little Intelligence already at our dis- 
posal. For, possibly because it is 
not “creative” (and creation usually 
implies chaos and refuse-heaps), Intel- 
ligence is especially preservative and 
sheltering. It is the natural purifier 
and tidier-up where Genius and 
Stupidity, disrupting and corrupting by 
turns, have between them played the 
deuce with our poor mortal heritage.

and Heroisms have once again 
presented to our foolish admiration, 
I would go so far as to add that 
Intelligence is often more humane 
than Sentiment, and, oftener still, 
more beneficent than what we call 
Virtue. 
From the misapplications of our 
Science, the exaggerations and lunacies 
of our Genius, and the havoc wrought 
by our higher instincts, we therefore 
need to be saved, not by Reason, which 
is always too long in getting under 
weigh, but by Intelligence, active, 
alacritous and ubiquitous, afraid neither 
of being laughed at nor of laughing 
at. others. «\'. . But<even'as J 
stammer out this old-fashioned demand 
for Salvation, the name of Proteus 
sounds suddenly in the ear of my spirit. 
How can I tell what Proteus may next 
be—perhaps already is—changing into? 
And after prating about Intelligence 
being one-half light-hearted scepticism 
and one-half steady confidence, am I 
going to join the mixed choir, ecstatic 2

or growling, of prophesying optimists 
and pessimists? 
But, though restrained by that 
thought of Proteus and his frequently 
inconsiderate metamorphoses, I should 
like to add a word on one question 
regarding the near future of Intelli- 
gence, but with the understanding that 
I do so not as a prophet of what may 
happen, so much as a witness of half a 
century’s already accomplished changes. 
The question, or rather query, has 
doubtless occurred to some of my 
readers, and is as follows: Granted that 
Intelligence rids us of dangerous super- 
stitions, and rids us, moreover, of the 
habit of superstition, which is a mat- 
ter less of what than of how one be- 
lieves; granted that along with lucidity 
Intelligence brings also intellectual 
equity, cleanness and dignity; granted 
all this, may not such gains be paid for 
in disproportionate loss? And may not 
Intelligence itself constitute a danger? 
Has it not already begun despoiling 
life of many of the shelters built by 
[61 ]
-P-A-G-E-70
  PROTEUS 
the Ages with unknowing or inspired 
hands? Worse still: will it not replace 
with its narrow and wavering lucidity 
those dark unquestioning instincts and 
aspirations, lurking ever ready in the 
obscure organization and the mysteri- 
ous formule inherited from our re- 
motest ancestors? 
To this I would answer that, so far 
as my observation tells me, the soul 
will always find some shape and some 
material wherein to build, or to restore, 
the shelters needed in its moments of 
weariness and sorrow, there to await 
the consolation whch no creed seems 
to bring without the supreme aid of 
time. On the other hand, that the 
instinctive part of our nature, when it 
is truly instinctive, can surely be 
trusted to keep itself alive in the face 
of the (alas!) inevitably feeble impera- 
tives of such new-comers as Reason and 
Intelligence. Moreover, that all the 
sciences dealing with man point to the 
fact that traditional commandments 
and, even more, physiologically trans-

mitted tendencies, have constituted 
themselves as responses to changing 
environments and needs, so that their 
transformation may be expected as a 
result of the very movement of things 
which has produced them. 
And, finally, I would add that, even 
if all this were doubtful, we must accept 
the risks which the coming of Intelli- 
gence may entail upon us, because (so 
at least appears evident to me) whatever 
sets-back and temporary overwhelm- 
ings it may suffer in the future, 
Intelligence is of such nature that, once 
come, it must develop, or at least 
bide its time and revive in as yet 
unforeseeable manner. And_ Intelli- 
gence itself must prepare us to expect 
that every change may mean a loss, but 
likewise mean an opportunity. Perhaps 
it may even sometimes show us how 
the one can turn into the other; for 
does not Intelligence keep an eye on 
Proteus?

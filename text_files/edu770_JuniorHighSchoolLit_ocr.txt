        This volume, like Junior High School 
Literature, Books One and Two, provides 
a one-year course in literature so organized 
as to make deep and lasting impressions 
upon the student. 
The book includes an abundant supply 
of carefully chosen selections from the 
best writers of all time. Of the fifty or 
more authors represented, one half are 
masters of former times whose works have 
become classics; the other half are recent 
or contemporary writers who are recog- 
nized interpreters of our own time. Thus 
the book gives full recognition not only to 
the past but also to the Jiving present. 
To this abundance of material taken from 
the rich heritage of song and story comes 
the added zest of variety. 
A glance at the Contents will show that 
the editors have not regarded it as their 
task merely to supply a large amount of 
carefully chosen material in rich variety 
and of recognized excellence. They have 
felt, as many other teachers also have felt, 
that many anthologies are mere scrap- 
books. But the purpose of the study of 
literature is more than. momentary recrea- 
tion. The collection of literary master- 
pieces used in a school year may leave an 
impression but little more permanent than 
the impression left by the current maga- 
zine. The editors of this book recognize 
the value «f the magazine for its own par- 
they do not believe that the 
iterature should be a sort of 
tazine, ten months’ - issues 
a single cover. On the con- 
lieve the material should be 
as to make permanent im- 
he dominant ideas and ideals 
ire. 
te, like Books One and Two 
is so organized as to bring 
tain fundamental relations, 
ar stress upon the ideal of PREFACE. 
Nature. As Emerson rightly held, these 
three relations are the foundation of all - 
education: the mind of the past, the world 
of action, the world of Nature. ‘The book, _ 
by such organization, cannot fail to reén- 
force powerfully the study of history, of 
social and political -conditions, and of 
science—the three main divisions into 
which school and college courses are 
grouped. The study of literature, there- 
fore, is not an occupation for leisure hours 
but is made the heart of the school. 
To this end, care has been taken not 
only to secure the right selection of lit- 
erature, grouped under these fundamental 
divisions, but also to secure proper under- 
standing of them as individual units and 
also as parts of a group. This is accom- 
plished, first, through the various intro- 
ductions, written for the pupil, as in 
Books One and Two of this series, The 
general and special introductions, taken 
together, are an elementary treatise on how 
to read, on literary criticism, on the service 
of literature to life. They are better than 
such a mere treatise would be, for they 
are accompanied by the selections from 
great literature that aptly illustrate the 
various points. They should be studied 
“by the pupil and made the basis of dis- 
rip: a. the debt we owe the . 
relations of human brother- 
relations between man and 
ii cussion in class. At intervals they should 
be reviewed in the light of the literature 
that has been read. These introductions 
cover a great variety of subjects: the 
nature of literature, the characteristics of 
poetry, the relation of literature to human 
history and the development of institu- 
tions, the types of literature, etc. 
The other aids to study are equally 
distinctive. Classics are provided with a 
minimum of annotation, and this annota- 
tion is always directed to the needs of the 
pupil. The editors have sought to avoid 
the over-annotation which always results 
from regarding the masterpiece as a unit 
in itself. The notes are not designed to 
show editorial erudition or minuteness; 
they are put in to enable the pupil to come

iv PREFACE 
to a complete understanding of his reading 
without interrupting that reading a mo- 
ment longer than necessary. 
Therefore, words that can be looked up 
in a good secondary-school dictionary are 
not annotated. It is assumed that the 
pupil possesses such a dictionary, and that 
he will use it. The explanations of special 
terms, printed as footnotes, are designed 
to help the student to read intelligently, 
not to form the basis for questions by the 
teacher. At the end of the selection, or, 
in the case of longer units, at the chapter 
or scene divisions, will be found helps 
of two kinds. The first of these con- 
sists of explanatory notes designed to 
give additional information necessary to 
intelligent reading; the second and more 
important consists of questions to guide 
the pupil’s reading as he prepares ‘his 
lesson and also as the basis for class dis- 
cussion, In reading a selection such as 
Julius Caesar mainly for the story, notes 
intended for detailed study may well be 
disregarded. Many of the questions in- 
volve independent thinking. Many of 
them seek to connect the pupil’s reading 
with other interests; for the relation be- 
tween literature and life in this series is no 
fanciful relation. It is organic, interwoven 
in many different ways into the body of 
the book and its method. Teachers will 
also find, at frequent intervals, exercises in 
oral composition, suggestions for library 
reading, and suggestions for class reading 
and for dramatization. At the end of the 
book will be found a biographical index in 
which the necessary information is given 
concerning the lives of all the authors 
represented in the book, major authors 
being presented with due regard to the 
special needs of the pupil who is reading the 
selections in the body of the book. These 
biographies are not essays such as older 
students would use, but are written ex- 
pressly from the standpoint. of the book. 
There is also a brief dictionary of technical 
terms in criticism, for occasional reference 
or for study as the teacher may decide., 
In this book two general conditions 
have influenced the choice of materials, 
In the first place, the masterpieces re- 
quired for admission to college under the 
conference plan are so fully represented as 
to make unnecessary the purchase of separate classics. Besides the 
of economy, there is also in th 
advantage of careful gradatic 
ganization. Through many y 
perience by hundreds of teache 
grown up a fairly standardi 
minimum essentials, a list of

which a plan for library readin 
discussion has been worked out 
may supply, through the scho 
sufficient number of complet: 
these few books to enable th 
read them in connection wit: 
plans given in the text. 
The second point is that the 
in entire agreement with the s 
the aims and scope of the course 11 cugusn 
as set forth in the recent report of the 
Committee on English of the North Central 
Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools. This volume does not limit itself 
to a few selections for intensive study; 
around these major works are grouped 
many others, so that there is abundant 
material for choice. Teachers may decide 
for themselves which selections are to be 
read rapidly and which are to be studied 
carefully and with detail. They may also 
condense and omit at will. The generous 
quantity of literature makes this book 
especially adapted for use in schools that 
organize classes on a basis of uniform 
abilities. 
The course here provided has been 
checked carefully with such documents as 
the Report of the Committee of the 
National Council of Teachers of English, 
the Uniform Entrance and the Special 
Requirements in English, and the special 
courses and syllabi provided by the states 
of New York, Pennsylvania, and others. 
Moreover, it illustrates the leading ten- 
dencies in the best modern teaching: 
a. wide variety and interest. of subject 
matter; b. indisputable quality; ¢ the 
union of the contemporary and the classic; 
d., the study of such types of literature as 
the drama, the epic, the metrical romance, 
the ballad, the lyric, and prose fiction. 
The book thus provides for all the purposes 
that a collection of literature for this grade 
should supply.

LITERATURE AND LIFE 
An Inrropuction to Reapina 
  
If the races of men should suddenly dis- 
appear from the earth, leaving only the 
animals, great changes would take place. 
For a time, the works of men would remain, 
but gradually the lofty buildings in our 
cities would. crumble and collapse, the 
railroads would become thin lines of rusty 
steel buried in tangles of weeds, farms 
would’ be covered with brush and with 
great forests, the roads would become 
merely paths for animals, and in place of 
fertile fields and villages and busy cities 
the ancient jungle would return. Ex- 
ternal Nature would remain much the 
same as now. Season would. succeed 
season, the rivers would flow as majestical- 
ly as ever to the sea, the moon and stars 
would shine or would be blotted out by 
great storms; the woods would be filled     be 
THE RUINS OF ANCIENT ROME   with the music of bird song or the fragrance 
of flowers, or, in winter, would be clothed 
in their mantle of snow. And the animal 
world would be much the same as now, 
except that the wild beasts would become 
bolder and more numerous and the animals 
that man has tamed or has made his com- 
panions would become wild or would be 
destroyed by enemies of their own kind. 
In such a world, no more progress of the 
sort that seems progress to us would 
be possible. Animals would not build 
cities or make inventions or use telephones 
or trains or ships. There would still be 
such primitive methods of living as animals 
use. The races of animals would still keep 
up some such form of communication as 
they now seem to have. Cats, for exam- 
ple, look much alike, no matter what their 
breed, yet they know each other and have
-P-A-G-E-11
2 LITERATURE AND LIFE 
their quarrels and their methods of getting 
on with each other. Dogs differ from each 
’ other in appearance more than most other 
animals, yet dogs of every kind recognize 
each other and have some means of com- 
munication. But no codperation, working 
together for a safer and happier mode of 
- living; comes from this faint sense of rela- 
tionship that members of an animal-race 
feel for one another. 
One ‘reason for this failure is that the 
imagination and memory of animals are 
very small. We have no evidence that the 
beauty of Nature—~a vista in a forest or the 
grandeur of mountains or the tang of the 
salt spray—produces any effect on the ani- 
mals that look upon or hear or feel Nature’s 
wonders. Many of them have, to be sure, 
primitive ways of expressing their satisfac- 
tion over a good meal or a warm, sunny 
spot, or their discomfort when they are hurt 
or are deprived of something that they 
want. Birds seem to enjoy the music they 
make, and a great poet once said that it was 
his faith that every flower enjoys the air it 
breathes. But so far as we know, all the 
reactions of animals to what goes on about 
them are confined to the moment and are 
of the simplest kind. They know nothing 
of distant lands, unless they belong to 
animal races that migrate from place to 
place in search of food or in order to 
escape extreme cold or extreme heat. 
They have no records of their past history 
—no books or poems or permanent records 
of any kind. If mankind were to disap- 
pear from the earth, the horse and the 
cow and the dog and all the tribes of 
animals domesticated by man, would soon 
forget that a strange superior animal, 
walking upright and having uncanny 
powers over them, had ever used them for 
his pleasure or his profit, had ever cared 
for them in sheds and barns when they 
were tired, or had ever killed them for his 
own food when he was hungry. 
Man differs from the animals, then, 
chiefly in his power to ask questions of 
life and to get answers to his questions. 
He could project his thought more rapidly 
than he could walk, so he discovered 
means of transporting himself to places 
where he wanted to be. He used the 
ox and the horse to multiply his strength; when these were found wanting, he in- 
vented machines that would carry him 
still more rapidly—the ship, the train of 
ears running on ribbons of steel, the auto- 
mobile, the airplane. He was not satisfied 
with his power of communicating his 
thought to those of his fellows who were 
near by, so he discovered how to send his 
voice over thousands of miles by the aid 
of a slender wire, and then how to send 
it without even the wire. He communi- 
cated his thoughts by a system of sounds - 
that he developed with great precision, 
and then by representing these sounds on 
various materials—stone, bark, paper made 
of reeds, later on fabrics of finer qualities. 
He represented his ideas of the beauty of 
Nature by pictures that he drew on stone, 
or on canvas; at length he discovered how 
to send his pictures through space by tele- 
phone. He lived in huts or caves, then in 
tents that he could carry about with him, 
still later, if he desired, in houses that 
could fly with incredible speed on rails. 
In order to increase his powers he enlarged 
his group of associates, which at first was 
like the group of animals, so that thou- 
sands, even millions, of his kind could live 
within a small area in buildings not built 
on one level but on ten or twenty or fifty 
levels. And he kept records of his deeds, 
and of his thoughts, and of his ideas of 
the beauty of Nature and life, so that he 
could live in the past as well as in the 
present, and could learn from generations 
Jong dead. 
Now all this may be summed up by say- 
ing that man is so constituted that he 
can reflect about the things that surround. 
him. The reactions of animals are simple, 
are limited to the moment. Man seizes on 
what is of service to him, and can determine 
how to make this even more serviceable. 
He can project his mind into the world 
about him or into the past or the future, 
can see what he wishes to bring to pass, and 
can set. about making it possible; or he 
can see what he wishes to preserve of the 
past for his present or future profit and 
enjoyment. He can live more lives than 
one. He multiplies himself in a thousand 
ways. He makes all things serve him. He 
explores the mysteries of Nature, the 
sources of life, and the causes of death.
-P-A-G-E-12
LITERATURE AND LIFE . 8 
And always he expresses his thoughts and 
his desires, in music, in art, in poetry. He 
is curious about himself, about Nature, 
about the stars and the waters and the 
depths of the earth, about his fellows, 
about the world before life came to it, 
about his soul and its fate, about the 
future of his race. He can bask in the 
sun after‘a good meal, just like any animal. 
Like an animal he will fight for food, for 
his young, to repel the stranger, to get 
into his possession things that he desires. 
But he can reflect on these things that 
he desires, or curb his desires when they 
are wicked. He lives according to his 
ideals of how a man should live, and 
multiplies his powers to enjoy the months 
and years during which he lives on the 
earth and partakes of its benefits. 
One of the chief sources of man’s power 
to raise his life above that of the brute 
beasts, who do not know their ancestry or 
their period of life and death, lies in his 
command of self-expression. He reflects 
about things, can communicate his 
thoughts to his fellows, can set down his 
ideas of beauty and right action. His life, 
like that of animals, is concerned with 
what goes on in his immediate presence, 
with food and shelter and comfort. But 
he not only has found out how to insure 
his food and his comfort to a higher degree 
than the animals; he has also found 
joys and powers that animals know nothing 
about. He finds enjoyment not only in his 
‘immediate surroundings, but in a world of 
fancy and imagination. He can forget 
the present, his weariness of the struggle for 
food and life, his sorrow—for his very 
superiority to animals in love and sense 
of beauty makes him more subject to 
suffering than the beasts—he can forget 
all that surrounds him, if he will, in a 
world of imagination into which he can 
pass instantly. The animal, confronted 
by a crisis, can draw on no inspiring past 
in which his race has triumphed, but must 
meet it for himself alone. But man finds 
new powers born in him from his knowledge 
of. how his fellows in far distant ages met 
life’s difficulties bravely, or rejoiced in its 
beauty, or had faith in the future of the 
soul, What is more, the animal knows no 
-law of relationship besides the instinct of parenthood and even this is lost after a 
time, while man has discovered not only 
enormous gains to be won through co- 
éperation with his fellows but also the joy 
that such codperation brings. He has en- 
larged his self, developed a wider personal- 
ity, through sympathy and service, through 
the brotherhood of the race. And, finally, 
he has found a larger and deeper person- 
ality through reflecting on his relation to 
Nature and the world in which he lives. 
He has Jearned how to make Nature serve 
him; he has also felt the magic and the 
mystery of flower and star, of the tempest- 
driven sea, of the silent pageantry of the 
summer night and the canopy of stars.

Before we go any farther, suppose we 
stop for a moment to think over what we 
have just been speaking about. 
We are apt to think that the age in 
which we live is the most marvelous in the 
history of man because people, or most of 
them, live so much more comfortably than 
in earlier times. In Shakespeare’s England, 
to go no farther back, travel was slow and 
dangerous; houses were cold, badly lighted, 
inconvenient; terrible diseases devastated 
whole provinces. Yet great men lived then, 
and great things were done then. The 
point is‘that unless we are careful we shall 
be in danger of thinking that the greatness 
of man in this twentieth century consists 
merely in material comforts and enterprises. 
An office boy can use the telephone, travel 
on fast trains, run an automobile. Shake- 
speare knew nothing of these things, knew 
nothing of a thousand wonders that are 
commonplace to us. But does the office 
boy tower above Shakespeare because of 
these things? 
The fact is that the most vital dif- 
ferences between men and animals consist 
in things quite apart from what we call 
the conveniences of modern life. These 
things are memory and imagination. 
Through memory men make use of their 
own past experiences and of the past ex- 
periences of the race. This means not 
only that great deeds live on, great achieve- 
ments for human welfare, the victories of 
the human spirit, but also that whatever 
of progress toward greater human comfort

and efficiency has been achieved by one 
generation becomes so much capital on 
which a new generation may build. 
Through imagination men conceive new 
wants and find means for satisfying them. 
Both memory and imagination are the 
roots of*progress. . 
John Milton studied the great achieve- 
ments of men in earlier times, became 
inspired to write a poem that the world 
would not willingly let die, and through 
the power of his creative imagination 
brought his dream to reality. When the 
Norman hosts marched to battle a minstrel 
sang to them of the great deeds of Roland, 
Charlemagne’s knight, so that all the 
soldiers were set on fire with the determina- 
tion to perform valorous deeds. When 
Galileo saw the swaying lights suspended 
from the ceiling of the church he con- 
ceived the idea of the pendulum, from 
which clocks came into being. The mind 
of Isaac Newton leaped from the observa- 
tion of the fall of an apple to the formula- 
tion of the laws that control the universe. 
Tn all of these incidents, and in thousands 
like them, memory and imagination prove 
their power. : 
The same thing is true of all science and 
invention, For thousands of years plagues 
swept men-off like flies. Whole regions of 
the earth were uninhabitable by white 
men. But typhoid and other fevers have 
been conquered. Men live as securely 
in India or in Panama as in the most 
highly civilized country. In the Grand 
Central Terminal in New York you may 
see the first train of cars to make regular 
trips on an American ‘railway. It is in- 
teresting to compare the tiny engine with 
the mighty locomotive of today, and the 
little open carriage with the modern 
Pullman. Yet only a few years separate 
‘the “Rocket” and its carriage from the 
“Twentieth Century Limited.’ Men have 
won these, and thousands of other secrets 
from Nature through their ability to build 
on past experiences and to visualize the 
thing they wished to create. . 
Animals cannot do these things. 
Neither can the office boy, unless he is 
alive to what is at the basis of progress. 
But the office boy has within him the 
hidden possibilities that may make him one day a discoverer of new truth. He 
may become the head of a great busi- 
ness organization, or a great painter or 
dramatist, or a statesman able to bless 
mankind. He may be a source of comfort 
or strength to generations that will live a 
thousand years after he is dead. Even if 
such high destiny is not in store far him, he 
may so enrich his own life that he crowds 
into it experiences of past generations, ex- 
periences drawn from distant countries, 
contacts with all that the mind of man 
has accomplished, imaginations destined 
to raise him, and his descendants, to a 
higher scale of living. 
Or, he may live the life of an animal.

What has all this to do with Literature 
and Life? To put it more definitely, what 
has it to do with your reading and study of 
this book? 
Literature is one form of the expression 
of life. It is not the only form. Men 
express themselves in many ways: through 
the language they speak, the homes they 
live in, the cities and great industries 
which are the sources of their wealth and 
their means of existence. All that con- 
cerns the material part of life, therefore, is 
an expression of some of the ideals about 
life that men and women hold. It is not 
less true that some part of the meaning of 
life may find expression through a beauti- 
ful painting, or a statue, or a song. A 
story. may sum up in a few hundred words 
an ideal that thousands of men would like 
to live by, or, if need be, to die for. A 
poem may sing itself into the heart of a 
regiment, or comfort those who are dis- 
couraged, or translate the beauty of bird~ 
song or flower or of the setting sun into 
words that will never die. Literature is 
the expression of the meaning and beauty 
of life, and if men could not find in life 
beauty and meaning, they would not care 
to live. 
In this book you will find illustrations of 
the way in which literature is related to life. 
Many collections of literature are merely 
collections. They are like magazines, 
‘You may read here and there, paying at- 
tention only to what interests you, and. 
with no thought of any relation between
-P-A-G-E-14
LITERATURE AND LIFE 5 
the selections. This book, of course, may 
be used in just the same way. But it is 
not intended for such use, as the program 
will show you. 
The program is the Table of Contents. 
If you wilblook at it for a moment you will 
see that the book contains ballads, epics, 
dramas, short stories, lyrics, and prose 
selections of various sorts. You will find 
a part of one of the oldest poems in the’ 
world, the Odyssey of Homer, some ballads 
that belong to a very early and primitive 
type of English culture, and some poems 
that were written only the other day. 
You have, then, a considerable amount of 
literature at your disposal. We may omit, 
for the present, any discussion of the 
difference between literature and ordinary 
printed matter, stating only this fact: 
literature means not merely that which 
is printed, in contrast to that which 
is spoken, but it is “The expression 
of the facts of life, or of the interpretation 
of life, or of the beauty of life, in language 
of such enduring charm that men treasure 
it and will not let it die.” Facts, interpre- 
tation, beauty—the selections in the fol- 
lowing pages are built upon this relation- 
ship between literature and life. 
But this is not all. You will observe that 
the book is divided into four parts, and 
that these parts deal with adventure, 
legend and history, the relations of man 
to his fellows, and the relations of man 
to Nature. The Introduction prefixed to 
each of these parts will bring out the 
meaning of these divisions. Just now 
only one thing is necessary, and this idea 
you should carry with you throughout 
your study. The general purpose of the 
book is to show how, through literature, 
men have put on record their ideas about 
this great adventure of living. No one 
who is worth anything is satisfied with 
mere existence. Such a life is mere prose. 
Man wants adventure, because through 
adventure he finds a means of realizing 
some of his ideals of what makes life 
interesting. Therefore, the first part of 
this book is devoted to some stories about 
adventures of all sorts. There is nothing 
serious here. They are just snapshots of 
scenes in all sorts of lives in all sorts of 
times, like the snapshots that you take with your kodak on a summer vacation - 
trip. They are to be added to the collec- 
tion you have been making ever since you 
read with amazement of Jack Horner’s 
exploits with the Christmas pie. You will 
continue to add to your collection as long 
as you live. 
In the second part of the book, legend 
and history—also forms of adventure— 
become means through which we may 
enter into the experience of the race. 
In many of these we see how men have 
sought to realize their fullest. powers 
through some heroic deed. 
In Part.IIE of the book, man’s effort to 
realize his ideals finds a different defini- 
tion. It is not alone through the spectac- 
ular deed that a man comes to himself. 
He may bring out the best within him- 
self through sympathy, through service, 
through coéperation. Democracy rests on 
this idea of codperation of all for the good 
of all. It is not necessary to be a knight 
of Arthur’s court in order to find the full- 
est expression of one’s powers. 
And finally, in Part IV the intimate 
relationship between man and Nature is 
brought out in a series of selections that 
show, on the one hand, how man inter- 
prets in terms of beauty the world in 
which he lives, and, on the other, how he 
makes use of the forces of Nature to give 
him enjoyment and safety. 
For literature is the record of the ad- 
ventures of the soul of man as he struggles 
to understand himself and the world in 
which he lives. It is one of the chief 
sources of right enjoyment and of right 
thinking. In it we find not merely a 
subject to be studied in school as a series 
of lessons, but a means of satisfying our ~ 
curiosity about life, of living more lives 
than one. It opens a world of fancy and 
imagination into which we go at will, just 
as Ali Baba or Aladdin could enter the 
world of magic by using a charm. It 
opens a world of heroic action, through 
which the desire to do worthy things 
may be born in us. It opens a world of 
sympathy and service because it shows 
how men have sought for realization of . 
their highest ideals through service to — 
their fellows. And it brings enrichment 
through knowledge of the world of Nature,
-P-A-G-E-15
6 LITERATURE AND LIFE 
@ perception of the beauty of Nature and 
of the way in which Nature serves man as 
the genius of the lamp served Aladdin. 
Poetry, drama, story, all writing that men 
have preserved because of its beauty or 
its enduring worth, these are means for recreation and for growth. By reading, 
man is lifted far above the realm in which 
animals pass their lives, and is taught how 
to crowd into his brief years enjoyment and 
experience that make rich his life and’ 
multiply his powers. 
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. What evidence can you find that animals 
possess the power of communicating with each 
other? Give some illustrations from your per- 
sonal experience. What is language? What 
can you find of its origin? (Try an encyclopedia, 
or use some book on the history of language. 
There is a fascinating chapter on this subject in 
Words and Their Ways in English Speech, by 
Greenough and Kittredge, pp. 1-6). What is 
the difference between the language of an un- 
civilized man, such as an Indian when the 
white men first came to America, and that of 
an educated man? What is the difference be- 
tween the language used in a conference of 
technical experts, such as a group of engineers, 
and that used by a group of men who are discuss- 
ing a national baseball championship? 
2. What was the origin of writing? Give a 
definition. Look up the article “Writing” in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica or in some other similar 
work. Define some primitive means of com- 
munication, such as message-sticks, marked 
pebbles, picture-writing, and any others that 
you find. 
8. One of the most widely used dictionaries 
defines four hundred thousand words. What 
does this fact suggest to you? Shakespeare used. 
about fifteen thousand words. How many words 
does an untrained man use, do you suppose? 
What is the difference between recognizing the 
meaning of a word when you are reading a selec- 
tion in a book and using it in your own writing and speaking? Why is the addition of words to 
your vocabulary an important element in your 
education? 
4, Sum up the results of your work by making 
a brief statement of the differences between an 
intelligent animal and an intelligent man so far 
as language, writing, vocabulary are concerned. 
5. Name several ways in which men have re- 
corded their past history. In what way may a 
poem be such a record? Name several poems 
that seem to you to have historical value. 
6. In what ways are the telephone, the ocean 
liner, and the electric light illustrations of man’s 
“power to ask questions of life and to get answers 
to his questions”? Show that these and other 
forms of what we call “progress” depend in part 
upon some sort of “records” or previous at~ 
tempts to find answers to man’s questions. 
7. Does “progress” —that is, the possession of 
greater wealth, greater command over Nature, 
more conveniences—necessarily mean a higher 
state of civilization? What is the point of com- 
parison between Shakespeare and the office boy? 
8. How does memory enter into language, 
written expression, the progress of invention and 
discovery? How does imagination enter in? Is 
imagination a characteristic only of the poet or 
the novelist, or is it characteristic also of the 
inventor? Is it necessary in building up a great 
business?

  AN INTRODUCTION 
I 
Reading is, first of all, a means of recrea- 
tion, like games or music or the drama or travel or any of the other amusements by which people forget their ordinary occupa- 
tions and get out of the ruts of their ordinary thought and speech. The first test of literature, therefore, is its power to take us out of ourselves. While we read, we live in a world that is attractive through its strangeness, a world of fancy and imagination. The measure of the power of what we read lies in the completeness 
with which we are absorbed into this un- accustomed world. If you become thor- oughly interested in the Indian stories of Fenimore Cooper, you are transported to the scenes in which the action moves; you are a companion to Natty Bumppo; he is as real to you as if you could actually see him. and hear him speak. You can recall stories in which you became so absorbed that you did not hear if some- one called you or spoke to you. You were not willing to lay aside the book until you had devoured the whole of it. Your book was like the magic carpet of old romance, powerful to carry you far off from your actual surroundings and into a world where all manner of strange adventures awaited you. 
This test of interest—deep, absorbing interest—is a fair one. It is met by all reading that once gets full influence over you. It may even be met, on occasion, by that which is not literature. For example, you may become greatly. in- | terested in wireless telegraphy. As a | result of this interest, a book on the sub- ject may seem, for the time, far more ab- . sorbing than any other reading that you 
2 can find. You eagerly devour every scrap of information you can pick up on the subject. The fascination that literature can exert is akin to the fascination that the handbook on wireless telegraphy pos- “Sesses, though it springs from different 
causes, 
It is not, primarily, the information that you gain from poetry and story and drama that marks the difference between what is literature and what is not. An en- cyclopedia or a dictionary or a treatise on history or science may give you far more useful information than you can get from this book or from any other book devoted 
to literature. Neither is it in the moral lessons or even in the ideals of conduct sug- gested that you find the chief reason for reading. Literature gives information and is filled with noble ideals, but its first use for you is to bring pleasure. This book, like every book filled with what we call literature as distinct from writing that seeks only to give information, is more than a series of lessons. 
Suppose we look a little more closely at this distinction between what we call a “lesson” and that which we call a recreation or a source of pleasure. Some “lesson,” for example, may be distasteful 
to you because you don’t find it interest- ing. If you are conscientious, you can probably. force yourself to learn it, but you take no pleasure in it, and you spend as little time on it as you can. 
It doesn’t take you out of yourself, 
Literature, rightly used, possesses the power to take you out of yourself, to widen your horizon, to increase the Tange of your interests. The pleasures that. are brought by any departure from our

10 THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
usual way of living are of different kinds 
and values. Some of them are mere sur- 
renders to easy and unworthy ideals. It 
is possible to increase the fineness of one’s 
ideas about pleasure through the develop- 
ment of standards of taste. The man 
who has acquired such standards finds 
just as keen enjoyment in a bit of fine 
music as someone else finds in mere 
noise, as much pleasure in a noble poem or 
picture as someone else finds in doggerel or 
a cheap print. To cultivate one’s ap- 
preciation for pleasures that involve judg- 
ment and standards of taste is no small 
part of the training that reading affords. 
These standards are not arbitrary or 
fixed by mere rules. They develop natural- 
ly in one who gives attention to the 
matter. In this part of your book, for 
example, you will find stories, some ‘of 
them thrilling and dramatic, others humor- 
ous, which many people have agreed to 
call good stories. It isn’t necessary to 
cal] them masterpieces and to differen- 
tiate between them and the stories in a 
popular magazine. The magazine may 
contain stories just as good; in fact, some 
of these very stories first appeared in the 
magazines of their time. The one thing 
for you to do is to do just what you do 
with your new magazine—read for enjoy- 
ment, without thinking of any lesson or 
anything to be learned, and then to apply 
just the same test that you apply to your 
magazine ‘story, the test of whether it 
interests you or not. But when you have 
done this, you might ask yourself just 
why you like the story or do not like it. 
The notes and questions that follow the 
selection may help you to find this out; 
that is all they are for—not to supply you 
, With tasks, but to help you to form your 
| own standards by which to judge between 
| that which is true and that which is false, 
between genuine representation of life and 
character and a sentimental or unreal 
imitation, between genuine humor and 
the cheap jest. 
This done, you can use these standards, 
your own standards, not those that have 
been forced upon you, to apply to the new 
magazine. Perhaps you will read, in some 
magazine, one story that seems to you as 
effective and as interesting as one of those you have used as a standard, while an 
you will see is cheap and unwc 
Always the test is of interest, of pov 
carry you out of yourself into ar 
familiar world, but you are to form 
own standards of what is true and 
is false, of the difference between 
you feel that you have a right to enjo 
what you feel is unworthy of you. 
‘The story is told of a famous artis 
was once approached by an ignorant put 
conceited woman with the remark: “I 
don’t know a thing in the world about art, | 
but I know what I like and what I don’t 
like.” “Madam,” gravely responded. the 
artist, “so does a cow.” _ 
To get the utmost enjoyment out of 
your reading is therefore the first thing to 
look for. And part of this enjoyment 
springs from certain qualities that we 
bring to our reading, qualities of judg- 
ment, taste, and of right appreciation. 
Ir 
- Books and reading, we have found, are 
an introduction to a world of adventure. 
This does not mean that they deal only 
with exciting events. So long as you do 
only the accustomed things, travel the 
same path every day, and every day see 
only the same things, your life has in it 
no adventure. Adventure is that which 
takes you out of yourself, gives you an 
unwonted experience. Such an experience 
may be encountered anywhere, at any time. 
In one of Shakespeare’s plays, a nobleman, 
living in exile, speaks of the charm of his, 
quiet life far from wars and courts, a life 
in which, he says, he 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running| 
brooks, 
Sermons in stones, and good in everything. 
Partly this was due to the fact that h. 
was living in surroundings strange t: *” 
far from “public haunt.” A peasar 
had lived all his life there might no 
found any adventure in the trees or broo 
or stones. Adventure to such a mi 
would be a ride on a train or in the subwa, 
or a sight of a great city from the top of 
tall building. Adventure, once more} ; 
that which takes you out of yourself.

THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE iW 
adventure may be a part of your real life 
or it may be a part of the life that you 
find in books. Shakespeare, whose dramas 
are a book-world in adventures in them- 
selves, often speaks of this book-world and 
the real world in almost the same terms. 
“My library,” one of his characters says, 
“was dukedom large enough.” And Words- 
worth speaks of books as a world in them- 
selves: 
Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we 
‘ know, * 
Are a substantial world, both pure and good. 
Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and 
blood, 
Our pastime and our happiness will grow. 
It is in this sense that you are now in- 
vited to enter the World of Adventure 
that is in books. For your introduction 
to this world, here are some good stories. 
But all your reading, in the later parts of 
this book, in other books—all your read- 
ing may be travels “in the realms of gold,” 
to use the fine phrase by which Keats de- 
scribed his adventures in reading. In such 
reading, you are also living, for literature 
is but an expression of life. This expres- 
sion must satisfy us by its beauty, interest 
us by the zest and spirit with which it por- 
trays its world, and take us out of the 
beaten track of everyday existence into a 
world of adventure more precious than a 
dukedom. 
Til 
An interesting series of essays appeared. 
in the Ailantic Monthly in 1921-2 under the 
title “The Iron Man.” By this term the 
author personifies, in a vivid phrase, the 
vast development of machinery. Work 
that was formerly done by human strength, 
if done at all, is now performed by machines 
of such power and dexterity that they 
seem almost human. With the further 
perfection of machinery, the time may 
come when the work of the world may be 
performed in only a part of the week. 
Even now, men have more leisure than 
in former times, and this margin between 
the hours of labor necessary for one to earn 
a living and one’s free time is growing 
greater year by year. 
All this brings sharply to mind the 
question of what we are to do with our leisure when it is gained. To this there 
are Many answers, some of them good and 
others evil. Just one aspect of the matter 
concerns us here. It is not merely a ques- 
tion of how you are to use your time for 
recreation, the time when there are no 
lessons to learn or work to be done, or 
even when your hour for skating or tennis 
or football has given way to the hour for 
reading. It is a matter that may be even 
more important to you forty years from 
now than it is today. 
When that time comes, reading will bea 
source of keen enjoyment to you, or will 
mean nothing at all, just in proportion as 
you learn to read now. Learning to read - 
is not just a matter of ability to pronounce 
and define words, or to understand a 
description of a fire or an account of a 
murder in the morning paper. The interest 
that the expression of thought may have 
for you is one that increases with exercise, 
like the interest you take ina game. The 
qualities of judgment, taste, and right 
appreciation that were spoken of a moment 
ago, qualities that add to your enjoyment 
of what you read, are also capable of 
development. With such habits of read- 
ing, formed easily now, you will find books 
a never-failing source of recreation, in- 
creasing in their power as the years go by. 
You are reading for enjoyment ‘now; 
you are laying up stores for enjoyment 
when you are old. 
Iv 
There are two worlds of adventure, then: 
the world of experience and action, and] 
the world of reading. Both of them en- 
rich our lives at the time when we enter 
them; both of them increase in meaning 
as we go on through life; both are store- 
houses of memory upon which we can 
draw at will. This parallel between the 
action-world and the book-world has never 
been more beautifully expressed than by 
Keats in the poem to which reference was © 
made a moment ago. He is speaking, in 
this poem, of the new world of delight that 
opened to him when he came upon Chap- 
man’s translation of Homer. No experi- 
ence that he had had in the realms of gold, ~ 
by which he meant this book-world, could 
compare with the adventure that came to
-P-A-G-E-21
12 THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
him when he stumbled upon Chapman’s 
Homer: 
Much have I traveled in the realms of gold, 
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; 
Round many western islands have I been 
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold. 
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told 
That deep-browed Homer rules as his 
demesne; . 
Yet never did I breathe its pure serene 
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and 
bold; ' 
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies 
When a new planet swims into his ken; 
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes 
He stared at the Pacific—and all his men 
Looked at each other with a wild surmise— 
Silent, upon a peak in Darien. 
You see at a glance how admirably this 
poem expresses the kinship between the 
book-world of adventure and the action- 
world. Two supreme experiences are 
drawn upon by the poet in his effort to 
tell us what reading Homer meant to 
him. You can conceive of no more thrill- 
ing experience than to have stood with 
the great explorer who first of our race 
looked upon the broad expanse of the 
Pacific. The explorer was Balboa, not 
Cortez. but this error of Keats makes no 
essential difference. Men had thought 
that the new lands discovered as the re- 
sult of Columbus’s daring journey were 
a part of India. That an ocean greater 
than the Atlantic yet separated them from the object of their search had not 
dawned upon them. To be the first of 
modern Europeans to come face to face 
with this stupendous fact, to have seen 
the narrow Mediterranean world expand 
to take in the vast Atlantic and then to 
find another mighty ocean stretching still 
farther to the west—what a thrilling ad- 
venture was this! It was to be compared 
only with the thrill that came to the astron- 
omer in those days when Galileo’s tele- 
scope was yet so new that the astronomer 
might hope to find with it a planet hith- 
erto unknown. Like these adventures of 
the action-world, says the poet, was the 
experience that came to him when the 
riches of Homer’s great poem were sud- 
denly revealed. The world of Homer, 
known only through his book, was as real 
as the new-found planet or the mighty 
ocean. Each experience was unique, stu- 
pendous, an adventure without parallel. 
No more oceans are to be discovered. 
Since Balboa’s time the Pacific and all the 
seven seas have been measured and charted. 
Men have stood at the North Pole and at 
the South. The wonders of the heavens, 
too, have been explored. But to you, to 
every girl and boy, may yet come the de- 
light which the poet classes with these— 
the entrance, through reading, upon a 
world of adventure, the realms of gold 
over which Homer, and Stevenson, and 
Scott, and Shakespeare, and many others 
like them rule as kings.

  HOW TOM SAWYER WHITEWASHED THE FEN CE 
Marx Twain 
Saturday morning was come, and 
all the summer world was bright and 
fresh, and brimming with life. There 
was a song in every heart; and if 
the heart was young, the music issued 
at the lips. There was cheer in every 
face and a spring in every step. The 
locust trees were in bloom and the 
fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. 
Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and 
above it, was. green with vegetation, 
and it lay just far enough away to 
seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, 
reposeful, and inviting. 
Tom appeared on the sidewalk with 
a bucket of whitewash and a long- 
handled brush. He surveyed the fence, 
and all gladness left him and a deep 
melancholy settled down upon his 
spirit. Thirty yards of board fence 
nine feet high. Life to him seemed 
‘hollow, and existence but a burden. 
Sighing, he dipped his brush and 
passed it’ along the topmost plank; 
repeated the operation; did it again; 
compared the insignificant white- 
washed streak with the far-reaching 
continent of unwhitewashed fence, and 
sat down on a tree-box discouraged. 
Jim came skipping out at the gate 
with a tin pail, and singing “Buffalo 
Gals.” Bringing water from the town 
pump had always been hateful work 
in Tom’s eyes before, but now it did 
not strike him so. He remembered 
that there was company at the pump. 
White, mulatto, and negro boys and 
girls were always there waiting their 
turns, resting, trading playthings, 
18 wt jy 
quarreling, fighting, skylarking. And 
he remembered that although the 
pump was only a hundred and fifty 
yards off, Jim never got back with a 
bucket of water under an hour—and 
even then somebody generally had to 
go after him. Tom said: 
“Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if 
you'll whitewash some.” 
Jim shook his head and said: 
“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she 
tole me I got to go an’ git. dis water 
an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid any- 
body. She says she spec’ Mars Tom 
gwine to ax me to whitewash, an’ so 
she tole me go ‘long an’ ’tend to my 
own business—she "lowed she’d tend 
to de whitewashin’.” 
“Oh, never you mind what she said, 
Jim. That’s the way she always 
talks. Gimme the bucket—I won't 
be gone only a minute. She won't 
ever know.” 
“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole 
missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n 
me. "Deed she would.” 
“Shel She never licks anybody— 
whacks ’em over the head with her 
thimble—and who cares for that, P’'d 
like to know. She talks awful, but 
talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if 
she don’t cry. Jim, I'll give you a 
marvel. I'll give you a white alley!” 
Jim began to. waver. 
“White alley, Jim! 
bully taw.” 
“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, 
I tell you! But Mars Tom, I’s 
powerful ’fraid ole missis—” And it’s a 40

“And besides, if you will I’ll show 
you my sore toe.” 
Jim was only human—this attrac- 
tion was too much for him. He put 
down his pail, took the white alley, 
and bent over the toe with absorbing 
interest while the bandage was being 
unwound. In another moment he 
was flying down the street with his 
pail and a tingling rear, Tom was 
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt 
Polly was retiring from the field with 
a slipper in her hand and triumph in 
her eye. 
But Tom’s energy did not last. He 
began to think of the fun he had 
planned for this day, and his sorrows 
multiplied. Soon the free boys would 
come tripping along on all sorts of 
delicious expeditions, and they would 
make a world of fun of him for having 
to work—the very thought of it 
burned him like fire. He got out his 
worldly wealth and examined it— 
bits of toys, marbles, and trash; 
enough to buy an exchange of work, 
maybe, but not half enough to buy 
so much as half an hour of pure free- 
dom. So he returned his straitened 
means to his pocket, and gave up the 
idea of trying to buy the boys. At 
this dark and hopeless moment an 
inspiration burst upon him! No othing 
less than a great, magnificent inspira- 
tion. 
He took up his brush and went 
tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove 
in sight presently—the very boy, of 
all boys, whose ridicule he had been 
dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop- 
skip-and-jump—proof enough that his 
heart was light and his anticipations 
high. He was eating an apple, and 
giving a long, melodious whoop, at 
intervals, followed by a deep-toned 
ding-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he 
was personating a steamboat. As 
he drew near, he slackened speed, 
took the middle of the street, leaned THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
far over to starboard and rounded-to «5 
ponderously and with laborious pomp 
and circumstance—for he was per- 
sonating the Big Missouri, and con- 
sidered himself to be drawing nine 
feet of water. He was boat and cap- 
tain and engine-bells combined, so 
he had to imagine himself standing on 
his own hurricane-deck giving the 
orders and executing them: * 
“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!’’ 6 
The headway ran almost out and he 
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk. 
“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling- 
ling!” His arms straightened and 
stiffened down his sides. 
“Set her back on the stabboard! 
Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! 
Chow!” His right hand, meantime, 
describing stately circles—for it was 
representing a forty-foot wheel. 7 
“Let her go back on the labboard! 
Ting-a-ling-ling! © Chow - ch - chow- 
chow!’ The left hand began to de- 
scribe circles. 
“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling- 
ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead 
on the stabboard! Stop het! Let 
your outside turn over slow! Ting-a- 
ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out 
that head-line! Lively now! Come— 
out with your spring-line—what’re 
you about there? Take a turn around 
that stump with the bight of it! 
Stand by that stage, now—let her go! 
Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a~ 
ling-ling! Sh’! Sh’! SW” (trying 
the gauge-cocks). 
Tom went on whitewashing—paid 
no attention to the steamboat. Ben 
stared a moment and then said: 
“Hi-yi! You're up a stump, ain’t 
you?” 
No answer. Tom surveyed his last 
touch with the eye of an artist; then 
he gave his brush another gentle 
sweep and surveyed the result, as 
before. Ben ranged up alongside of 
him. Tom’s mouth watered for the

said: 
“Hello, old chap, you got to work, 
hey?” 
Tom wheeled suddenly and said: 
“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t 
noticing.” 
“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I 
am. Don’t you wish you could? 
But of course you’d druther work— 
wouldn’t you? Course you would!” 
Tom contemplated the boy a bit, 
and said: 
“What do you call work?” 
“Why, ain’t that work?” 
Tom resumed his whitewashing, and 
answered carelessly : 
“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it 
ain’t. 
Sawyer.” 
“Oh, come, now, you don’t mean 
to let on that you like it?” 
The brush continued to move. 
“Like it? Well, I don’t see why 
I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get 
a chance to whitewash a fence every 
day?” 
That put the thing in a new light. 
Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom 
swept his brush daintily back and 
forth—stepped back to note the effect 
—added a touch here and there— 
criticized the effect again—Ben watch- 
ing every move and getting more and 
more interested, more and more ab- 
sorbed. Presently he said: 
“Say, Tom, let me -whitewash a 
little.” 
Tom considered, was about to con- 
sent; but he altered his mind: 
“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t 
hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s 
awful particular about this fence— 
tight here on the street, you know— 
but if it was the back fence, I wouldn’t 
mind and she wouldn’t. Yes, she’s 
awful particular about this fence; it’s 
got to be done very careful; I reckon 
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, may- All I know, is, it suits Tom way it’s got to be done.” 
“No—is that so? Oh, come, now— 
lemme just try. Only just a little— 
Td let you, if you was me, Tom.” 
“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; 
but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted 
to do it, but she wouldn’t let 
him; Sid wanted to do it, and she 
wouldn’t let Sid. Now, don’t you see 
how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle 
this fence and anything was to hap- . 
pen to it—” 
“Oh, shucks, T’ll be just as careful. 
Now lemme try. Say—TI’ll give you 
the core of my apple.” 
“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. 
I’m afeard—” 
“Wil give you all of it!” 
Tom gave up the brush with reluc- 
tance in his face, but alacrity in his 
heart. And while the late steamér 
Big Missourt worked and sweated in 
the sun, the retired artist sat on a 
barrel in the shade close by, dangled 
his legs, munched his apple, and 
planned the slaughter of more inno- 
cents. There was no lack of mate--~ 
rial; boys happened along every little 
while; they came to jeer, but remained 
to whitewash. By the time Ben was 
fagged out, Tom had traded the next 
chance to Billy Fisher for a kite in 
good repair; and when he played out, 
Johnny Miller bought in for a dead 
rat and a string to swing it with—and 
so on, hour after hour. And when 
the middle of the afternoon came, 
from being a poor poverty-stricken 
boy in the morning, Tom was literally 
rolling in wealth. He had, besides 
the things before mentioned, twelve 
marbles, part of a jew’s-harp, a piece 
of blue bottle glass to look through, 
a spool cannon, a key that wouldn’t 
unlock anything, 4 fragment of chalk,

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
,Expianatory Norss 
1. For a brief biography of Mark Twain 
(and for all authors throughout this book) see 
the “Biographical Index of Authors” beginning 
on page 571 and arranged alphabetically. This 
selection is taken from The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer, one of three books (the others being 
Huckleberry Finn and Life on the Mississippi) 
in which Mark Twain rendered probably his 
greatest service to American literature. Of 
these Huckleberry Finn is the best; its hero has 
been compared with the hero of Homer’s Odyssey, 
about whom you will read in Part II of this 
book, and indeed Mark Twain’s book deserves 
very well the name that has been given it, “the 
Odyssean story of the Mississippi.” The three 
books taken together give something of the 
impression of an epic of the valley of the great 
river which is so bound up with American life. 
The stories perhaps seem even more character- 
istic of what we feel to be America than any 
stories of the early colonization of the eastern 
states. The Mississippi territory was settled 
by Americans, not by Englishmen, at a time 
when the genuine American character was being 
developed by the pioneers. The life that Mark 
Twain depicts is passing, but it is still near 
enough to us to be vivid, much as the story of 
Ulysses seemed to the Greeks in Homer’s day. 
2. Mark Twain, whose real name was 
Samuel L. Clemens, wrote much about boys, for 
boys of all ages. A proof of the fascination of 
his stories is found in the fact that Charles 
Darwin, the great English scientist, said that he 
always kept the story of ““The Celebrated Jump- 
ing Frog” (see Junior High School Literature, 
Book I) onachair by his bedside so that he might turn to it in case of sleeplessness. Mark T '

  L A DISSERTATION UPON ROAST PIG 17 
A DISSERTATION UPON ROAST PIG 
CHARLES LAMB . 
Mankind, says a Chinese manu- 
script, which my friend M. was oblig- 
ing enough to read and explain to 
me, for the first seventy thousand 
ages ate their meat raw, clawing or 
biting it from the living animal, just 
as they do in Abyssinia to this day. 
This period is not obscurely hinted 
at by their great Confucius in the 
second chapter of his Mundane Mu- 
tations, where he designates a kind of 
golden age by the term Cho-fang, 
literally, the Cook’s holiday. The 
manuscript goes on to say that the 
art of roasting, or rather broiling 
(which I take to be the elder brother), 
was accidentally discovered in the 
manner following: The swineherd, 
Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods 
one morning, as his manner was, to 
collect mast for his hogs, left his cot- 
tage in the care of his eldest son, Bo- 
bo, a great Inbberly boy, who being 
fond of playing with fire, as younkers 
of his age commonly are. let some 
sparks escape into a bundle of straw, 
which, kindling quickly, spread the 
conflagration over every part of their 
poor mansion, till it was reduced to 
ashes. Together with the cottage 
(@ sorry antediluvian makeshift of a 
building, you may think it), what was 
of much more importance, a fine litter 
of new-farrowed pigs, no less than 
nine in number, perished. China 
pigs have been esteemed a luxury all 
over the East from the remotest pe- 
tiods that we réad of. Bo-bo was in 
the utmost consternation, as you may

Chinese philosopher. think, not so much for the sake of the 
tenement, which his father and he 
could easily build up again with a 
few dry branches, and the labor of an 
hour or two, at any time, as for the 
loss of the pigs. While he was think- 
ing what he should say to his father, 
and wringing his hands over the 
smoking remnants of one of those un- 
timely sufferers, an odor assailed his 
nostrils, unlike any scent which he 
had before experienced. What could 
it proceed from? Not from the burnt 
cottage—he had smelled that smell 
before—indeed this was by no means 
the first accident of the kind which 
had occurred through the negligence 
of this unlucky young firebrand. Much 
less did it resemble that of any known 
herb, weed, or flower. A premoni- 
tory moistening at the same time 
overflowed his nether lip. He knew 
not what to think. He next stooped 
down to feel the pig, if there were any 
signs of life in it. He burned his 
fingers, and to cool them he applied 
them in his bogby fashion to his 
mouth. Some of the crumbs of the 
scorched skin had come away with 
his fingers, and for the first time in 
his life (in the world’s life indeed, for 
before him no man had known it) he 
tasted—crackling! Again he felt and 
fumbled at the pig. It did not burn 
him so much now, still ‘he licked his 
fingers from a sort of habit. The 
truth at length broke into his slow 
understanding—that it was the pig 
that smelled so, and the pig that 
tasted so delicious; and, surrendering 
himself up to the newborn pleasure, 
he fell to tearing up whole handfuls 60

of the scorched skin with the flesh 
next it, and was cramming it down 
his throat in his beastly fashion when 
his sire entered amid the smoking 
rafters, armed with retributory cudgel, 
and finding how affairs stood, began 
to rain blows upon the young rogue’s 
shoulders, as thick as_hailstones, 
which Bo-bo heeded not any more 
than if they had been flies. The 
tickling pleasure, which he experi- 
enced in his lower regions, had ren- 
dered him quite callous to any in- 
conveniences he might feel in those 
remote quarters. His father might 
lay on, but he could not beat him 
from ‘his pig, till he had fairly made 
an end of it, when, becoming a little 
more sensible of his situation, some- 
thing like the following dialogue ensued: 
“You graceless whelp, what have 
you got there dévouring? Is it not 
enough that you have burned me 
down three houses with your dog’s 
tricks, and be hanged to you, but you 
must be eating fire, and I know not 
what—what have. you got there, 
I say?” 
“O father, the pig, the pig, do come 
and taste how nice the burnt pig eats.” 
The ears of Ho-ti tingled with 
horror. He cursed his son, and he 
cursed himself that ever he should 
beget a son that should eat burnt pig. 
Bo-bo, whose scent was wonder- 
fully sharpened since morning, soon 
raked out another pig, and fairly 
rending it asunder, thrust the lesser 
half by main force into the fists of 
Ho-ti, still shouting out, “Eat, eat, 
eat the burnt pig, father, only taste— 
O Lord’—with such-like barbarous 
ejaculations, cramming all the while 
as if he would choke. 
Ho-ti trembled in every joint while 
he grasped the abominable thing, 
wavering whether he should not put 
his son to death for an unnatural 
young monster, when the crackling THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
scorching his fingers, as it had done 
his son’s, and applying the same 
remedy to them, he in his turn tasted. 
some of its flavor, which, make what 
sour mouths he would for a pretense, 
proved not altogether displeasing to 
him. In conclusion (for the manu- 
script here is a little tedious) both 
father and son fairly sat down to the 
mess, and never left off till they had 
dispatched all that remained of the 
litter. 
Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to 
let the secret escape, for the neighbors 
would certainly have stoned them for 
a couple of abominable wretches, who 
could think of improving upon the 
good meat which God had sent them. 
Nevertheless, strange stories got about. 
It was observed that Ho-ti’s cottage 
was burned down now more frequently 
than ever. Nothing but fires from 
this time forward. Some would break 
out in broad day, others in the night- 
time. As often as the sow farrowed, 
so sure was the house of Ho-ti to be 
in a blaze; and Ho-ti himself, which 
was the more remarkable, instead of 
chastising his son, seemed to grow 
more indulgent to him than ever. 
At length they were watched, the 
terrible mystery discovered, and father 
and son summoned to take their trial 
at Pekin, then an_ inconsiderable 
assize town. Evidence was given, 
the obnoxious food itself produced in 
court, and verdict about to be pro- 
nounced, when the foreman of the 
jury begged that some of the burnt 
pig, of which the culprits stood ac- 
cused, might be handed into the box, 
He handled it, and they all handled 
it, and burned their fingers, as Bo-bo 
and his father had done before them, 
and nature prompting to each of them 
the same remedy, against the face 
of all the facts, and the clearest charge 
which judge had ever given—to the 
surprise of the whole court, townsfolk,

strangers, reporters, and all present— 
without leaving the box, or any man- 
ner of consultation whatever, they

Not Guilty. © 
The judge, who was a shrewd fel- 
low, winked at the manifest iniquity | 
of the decision, and, when the court 
was dismissed, went privily and bought 
up all the pigs that could be had for 
love or money. In a few days his 
Lordship’s town house was observed 
to be on fire. The thing took wing, 
and now there was nothing to be seen 
but fires in every direction. Fuel and 
pigs grew enormously dear all over 
the districts. The insurance offices 
one and all. shut up shop. People 
built slighter and slighter every day, 
until it was feared that the very 
scence of architecture would in no 
long time be lost to the world. Thus 
this custom of firing houses continued, 
till in process of time, says my manu- 
script, a sage arose, like our Locke, 
who made a discovery, that the flesh 
of swine, or indeed of any other ani- 
mal, might be cooked (burnt, as they 
called it) without the necessity of 
consuming a whole house to dress it. 
Then first began the rude form of a 
gridiron. Roasting by the string, or 
spit, came in a century or two later, 
I forget in whose dynasty. By such 
slow degrees, concludes the manu- 
script, do the most useful, and seem- 
ingly the most obvious arts, make 
their way among mankind. . 
Without placing too implicit faith 
in the account above given, it must 
be agreed that if a worthy pretext 
for so dangerous an experiment as 
setting houses on fire (especially in 
these days) could be assigned in favor 
of any culinary object, that pretext 
and excuse might be found in roast

Of all the delicacies in the whole

be the most delicate—princeps ob-

I speak not of your grown porkers— 
things between pig and pork—those 
hobbledehoys—but a. young and ten- 
der suckling—under a moon old— 
guiltless as yet of the sty—with no 
original speck of the amor immunditiae, 
the hereditary failing of the first 
parent, yet manifest—his voice as yet 
not broken, but something between a 
childish treble and a gruamble—the mild 
forerunner, or praeludium, of a grunt. 
He must be roasted. I am not ig- 
norant that our ancestors ate them 
seethed, or boiled—but what a sac- 
rifice of the exterior tegument! 
There is no flavor comparable, I 
‘will contend, to that of the crisp, 
tawny, well-watched, not over-roasted, 
crackling, as it is well called—the very 
teeth are invited to their share of 
the pleasure at this banquet in over- 
coming the coy, brittle resistance— 
with the adhesive oleaginous—O call 
it not fat—but an indefinable sweet- 
ness growing up to it—the tender 
blossoming of fat—fat cropped in the 
bud—taken in the shoot—in the first 
innocence—the cream and quintes- 
sence of the child-pig’s yet pure food— 
the lean, no lean, but a kind of animal 
manna—or, rather, fat and lean (if 
it must be so) so blended and running 
into each other that both together 
make but one ambrosian result, or 
common substance. 
Behold him, while he is “doing”— 
it seemeth rather a refreshing warmth, 
than a scorching heat, that he is so 
passive to. How equably he twirleth

See him in the dish, his second 
cradle, how meek he lieth! Wouldst 
thou have had this innocent grow up 
to the grossness and indocility which 
too often accompany maturer swine- 
hood? Ten to one he would have 
proved a glutton, a sloven, an obsti-

in all manner of filthy conversation— 
from these sins he is happily snatched 
away—

epicure—and for such a tomb might 
be content to die.

~~she meddleth not with the appetite 
—and the coarsest hunger might bar- 
ter her consistently for a mutton chop. 
Pig—let me speak his praise—is no 
less provocative of the appetite than 
he is satisfactory to the criticalness

    A DISSERTATION UPON ROAST PIG 
of self-denial, and the very cox- 
combry of charity, schoolboy-like, I 
made him a present of—the whole 
cake! I walked on a little, buoyed 
up, as one is on such occasions, with 
a sweet soothing of self-satisfaction; 
but before I had got to the end of the 
bridge, my better feelings returned, 
and I burst into tears, thinking how 
ungrateful I had been to my good 
aunt, to go and give her good gift 
away to a stranger, that I had never 
seen before, and who might be a bad 
man for aught I knew; and then I 
thought of the pleasure my aunt 
would be taking in thinking that I— 
I myself, arid not another—would eat 
her nice cake—and what should I say 
to her the next time I saw her—how 
naughty I was to part with her pretty 
present—and the odor of that spicy 
cake came back upon my recollection, 
and the pleasure and the curiosity 
T had taken in seeing her make it, and 
her joy when she sent it to the oven, 
and how disappointed she would feel 
that I had never had a bit of it in my 
mouth at last—and I blamed my 
impertinent spirit of almsgiving, and 
out-of-place hypocrisy of goodness, 
and above all I wished never to see 
the face again of that insidious, good- 
for-nothing, old gray impostor. 
Our ancestors were nice in their 
method of sacrificing these tender 
victims. We read of pigs whipped to 
death, with something of a shock, as 
we hear of any other obsolete custom. 
The age of discipline is gone by, or it \ 21 
would be curious to inquire (in a 40 
philosophical light merely) what effect 
this process might have toward in- 
tenerating and dulcifying a substance 
naturally so mild and dulcet as the 
flesh of young pigs. It looks like 
refining a violet. Yet we should be 
cautious, while we condemn the in- 
humanity, how we censure the wisdom 
of the practice. It. might impart a 
gusto— 50 
I remember an hypothesis, argued 
upon by the young students, when I 
was at St. Omer’s, and maintained 
with much learning and pleasantry 
on both sides, “Whether, supposing 
that the flavor of a pig who obtained 
his death by whipping (per flagella- 
tionem extremam) superadded a pleas- 
ure upon the palate’ of a man more 
intense than any possible suffering 60 
we can conceive in the animal, is man 
justified in using that method of 
putting the animal to death?” I for- 
get the decision. . 
His sauce should be considered. 
Decidedly, a few bread crumbs, done

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Nores 
1. This amusing sketch is from The Essays 
of Elia (1820), the work on which Lamb’s fame 
rests. Originally these essays were contributed 
to the London Magazine; they were spmewhat 
similar to the special articles one finds in daily 
papers and magazines nowadays. They were 
on a variety of subjects, whimsical, serious, filled with humor and pathos, and always remarkable 
for their conversational quality, by which the 
author seemed to be talking with his reader. 
Examples, besides the present selection, are 
“Dream Children,” “On Poor Relations,” “Old 
China,” and the like. They bear little trace of 
Lamb’s occupation, that of a clerk in the East 
India House.

2. A “dissertation” is a learned essay on 
some difficult subject. You will enjoy the 
sketch most fully if you observe the element of 
burlesque that runs through it. Lamb pretends 
to be writing a learned essay on “roast pig.” 
Therefore he pretends to have found an ancient 
manuscript; he introduces learned words and 
quotations; he quotes “authorities” that do not 
exist. The Chinese names, excepting that of 
Confucius, are fictitious. 
8. While this sketch is one of a cbllection 
of “Essays,” the real interest is in the spirited 
narrative—it is really a short story. 
Questions AND Torics 
1. How does the author try to give author- 
ity for the fanciful tale he invented? How does 
he try to make the reader believe the story? 
Mention points in the story that seem probable. 2. Lamb was noted for his use of keen 
satire; what evidences of this characteristic do 
you find in this story? What examples of 
exaggeration do you find? At what weakness in 
human nature does Lamb poke fun? 
8. How does the author make his’ story 
humorous? Point out good examples of humor. 
4. In commenting on “the sins” from which 
the pig “is happily snatched” by being roasted, 
Lamb quotes from Coleridge’s “Epitaph on an 
Infant”; show the aptness of this quotation. 
5. Into what divisions or units does the 
story fall? What is the most interesting part 
of the story?

On the summit of one of the heights

  A TYPICAL OLD GERMAN CASTLE 
The baron had but one child, a 
daughter; but Nature, when she 
grants but one child, always com- 
pensates by making it a prodigy; and 
so it was with the daughter of the 
baron. All the nurses, gossips, and 
country cousins assured her father 
that she had not her equal for beauty 
in all Germany; and who should know 
better than they? She had, more- 
over, been brought up with great care 
under the superintendence of two 
maiden aunts, who had spent some 
years of their early life at one of the 
little German courts, and were skilled 
in all the branches of knowledge 
necessary to the education of a fine 
lady. Under their instructions she 
became a miracle of accomplish- 
ments. By the time she was eighteen, 
she could embroider to admiration, 
and had worked whole histories of 
the saints in tapestry, with such 
strength of expression in their coun- 
tenances that they looked like so many souls in purgatory. She could 
read without great difficulty, and had 
spelled her way through several church 
legends, and almost all the chivalric 
wonders of the Heldenbuch. She had 30 
even made considerable proficiency in 
writing; could sign her own name 
without missing a letter, and so legibly. 
that her aunts could read it. without 
spectacles. She excelled in making 
little elegant good-for-nothing ladylike 
nicknacks of all kinds; was versed in 
the most abstruse dancing of the day; 
played a number of airs on the harp 
and guitar; and knew all the tender 40 
ballads of the minnelieders by heart. 
Her aunts, too, having been great { 
flirts and coquettes in their younger 
days, were admirably calculated to be 
vigilant guardians and strict censors 
of the conduct of their niece; for

But, however scantily the. Baron 
Von Landshort might be provided 
with children, his household was by 
no means a small one; for Providence 
j had enriched him with abundance of 
poor relations. They, one and all, 
40 possessed the affectionate disposition 
common to humble relatives; _ were 
wonderfully attached to the baron, 
and took every possible occasion to 
come in swarms and enliven the castle. 
All family festivals were commemo-

was accidentally detained, mentioning

the day and hour when he might be 
expected to arrive. 
The castle was in a tumult of prepa- 
ration to give him a suitable welcome. 
The fair bride had been decked out 
with uncommon care. The two aunts 
had -superintended her toilet, and 
\) quarreled the whole morning about 
every article of her dress. The young 
o lady had taken advantage of their 
contest to follow the bent of her own 
taste; and fortunately it was a good 
one. “She looked as lovely as youth- 
ful bridegroom could desire; and the 
flutter of expectation heightened the 
luster of her charms. 
The suffusions that mantled her 
face and neck, the gentle heaving of 
' the bosom, the eye now and then lost 
9 in reverie, all betrayed the soft 
tumult that was going on in her little 
heart. The aunts were continually 
hovering around her; for maiden 
aunts are apt to take great interest 
jin affairs of this nature. They were 
giving her a world of staid counsel 
how to deport herself, what to say, 
. and in what manner to receive the 
expected lover. 
' 30, The baron was no less busied in 
preparations. He had, in truth, 
nothing exactly to do; but he was 
naturally a fuming, bustling little 
man, and could not remain passive 
when all the world was in a hurry. 
He worried from top to bottom of the 
castle with an. air of infinite anxiety; 
he continually called the servants 
from their work to exhort them to 
. 40 be diligent; and buzzed about every 
hall and chamber, as idly restless and 
importunate as a bluebottle fly on a 
warm summer’s day. 
In the meantime the fatted calf had 
been killed; the forests had rung with 
the ‘clamor of the huntsmen; the 
kitchen was crowded with good cheer; 
the: cellars had yiélded . up whole 25 
oceans of Rhein-wein and Ferne-wein; 
and even the great Heidelberg tun 
had been laid under contribution. 
Everything was ready to receive the 
distinguished guest with Saus und 
Braus in the true spirit of German 
hospitality—but the guest delayed 
to make his appearance. Hour rolled 
after hour. The sun, that had poured 
his downward rays upon the rich 
forest of the Odenwald, now just 
gleamed along the summits of the 
mountains. The baron mounted the 
highest tower, and strained his eyes 
in hope of catching a distant sight 
of the count and his attendants. 
Once he thought the beheld them; 
the sound of horns came floating from 
the valley, prolonged by the mountain 
echoes. A number of horsemen were 
seen far below, slowly advancing 
along the road; but when they had 
nearly reached the foot of the moun- 
tain, they suddenly struck off in a 
different direction. The last ray of 
sunshine departed—the bats began 
to flit by in the twilight—the road 
grew dimmer and dimmer to the view; 
and nothing appeared stirring in it 
but now and then a peasant lagging 
homeward from his labor. 
While the old castle of Landshort 
was in this state of perplexity, a very 
interesting scene was transacting in 
a different part of the Odenwald. 
The young Count Von Altenburg 
was tranquilly pursuing his route in 
that sober jog-trot way in which a 
man travels toward matrimony when 80 
his friends have taken all the trouble - 
and uncertainty of courtship off his 
hands, and a bride is waiting for him, 
as certainly as a dinner at the end of 
his journey. He had encountered at

arms, with whom he had seen some 
service on the frontiers—Herman Von 
Starkenfaust, one of the  stoutest 
hands, and worthiest hearts, of Ger- 
man chivalry, who was now returning 
from the army. His father’s castle 
was not far distant from the old 
fortress of Landshort, although an 
hereditary feud rendered the families 
hostile, and strangers to each other. 
In the warm-hearted moment of 
recognition, the young friends related. 
all their past adventures and for- 
tunes, and the count gave the whole 
history of his intended nuptials with 
a young lady whom he had never 
seen, but of whose charms he had 
received the most enrapturing de- 
scriptions. 
As the route of the friends. lay in 
the same direction, they agreed to 
perform the rest of their journey to- 
gether; and, that they might do it 
the more leisurely, set off from Wurtz~ 
burg at an early hour, the count 
having given directions for his retinue 
to follow and overtake him. 
They beguiled their wayfaring with 
recollections of their military scenes 
and adventures; but the count was 
apt to be a little tedious now and 
then about the reputed charms of his 
Pride, and the felicity that awaited 
im. 
In this way they had entered among 
the mountains of the Odenwald, and 
were traversing one of its most lonely 
and thickly-wooded passes. It is 
well known that the forests of Ger- 
many have always been as much 
infested by robbers as its castles by 
specters; and at this time the former 
were particularly numerous, from the 
hordes of disbanded soldiers wander- 
ing about the country. It will not 
appear extraordinary, therefore, that 
the cavaliers were attacked oy a gang 
of these stragglers.in the midst of the 
forest. They defended themselves THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
with bravery, but were ‘ne,

arrived to their assistance.

from the world; for he was a pas-

was a dash of eccentricity and enter-

fond of all singular adventure. 
Previous to his departure he made 
19 all due arrangements with the holy 
% fraternity of the convent for the 
funeral solemnities of his friend, who 
was to be buried in the cathedral of 
Wurtzburg, near some of his illustrious 
relatives; and the mourning retinue 
of the count took charge of his remains. 
It is now high time that we should 
return to the ancient family of Katzen- 
ellenbogen, who were impatient for 
20 their guest, and still more for their 
“dinner; and to the worthy little baron, 
whom we left airing himself on the 
watchtower. 
Night closed in, but still no guest 
arrived. The baron descended from 
the tower in despair. The banquet, 
which had been delayed from hour to 
hour, could no longer be postponed. 
The meats were already overdone; 
30 the cook in an agony; and the whole 
household had the look of a garrison 
that had been reduced by famine. 
The baron was obliged reluctantly to 
give orders for the feast. without the 
presence of the guest. All were seated 
at table, and just on the point of 
commencing, when the sound of a 
horn from without the. gate gave 
notice of the approach of a stranger. 
| 40 Another long blast filled the old courts 
of the castle with its echoes, and was 
answered by the warder from the walls. 
The baron hastened to receive his 
future son-in-law. 
The drawbridge had been let down, 
and the stranger was before the gate. 
He was a tall, gallant cavalier, 
mounted on a black steed. His coun- 
tenance was pale, but he had a 
      27 
beaming, romantic eye, and an air of 50 
stately melancholy. The baron was 
a little mortified that he should have 
come in this simple, solitary style/ 
His dignity for a moment was ruffled, 
and he felt disposed to consider it a 
want of proper respect for the im- 
portant occasion, and the important 
family with which he was to be con- 
nected. He pacified himself, how- 
ever, with the conclusion that it must 60 
have been youthful impatience which 
had induced him thus to spur on 
sooner than his attendants. 
“I am sorry,” said the stranger, 
“to break in upon you thus unsea- } 
sonabl. ” 
Here the baron interrupted him with 
a world of compliments and greetings; 
for, to tell the truth, he prided him-' 
self upon his courtesy and eloquence. 70 
The stranger attempted, once or twice, 
to stem the torrent of words, but in 
vain, so he bowed his head and 
suffered it to flow on. By the time 
the baron had come to a pause, they 
had reached the inner court of the . 
castle; and the stranger was again 
about to speak, when he was once 
more interrupted by the appearance 
of the female part of the family, so 
leading forth the shrinking and blush- 
ing bride. He gazed on her for a 
moment as one entranced; it seemed 
as if his whole soul beamed forth in 
the gaze, and rested upon that lovely 
form. One of the maiden aunts 
whispered something in her ear; she 
made an effort to speak; her moist 
blue eye was timidly raised; gave a 
shy glance of inquiry on the stranger; 90 
and was cast again to the ground. 
The words died away; but there was 
a sweet smile playing about her lips, 
and a soft dimpling of the cheek that 
showed her glance had not been un- 
satisfactory. It was impossible for 
“a girl of the fond age of eighteen, highly 
predisposed for love and matrimony,

not to be pleased with so gallant a 
cavalier. 
The late hour at which the guest had 
arrived left no time for parley. The 
baron was peremptory, and deferred 
all particular conversation until the 
morning, and led the way to the un- 
tasted banquet. 
It was served up in the great hall 
of the castle. Around the walls hung 
the hard-favored portraits of the 
heroes of the house of Katzenellen- 
bogen, and the trophies which they 
had gained in the field and in the 
chase. Hacked corselets, splintered 
justing spears, and tattered banners 
were mingled with the spoils of silvan 
warfare; the jaws of the wolf and 
the tusks of the boar grinned horribly 
among crossbows and_battle-axes, 
and a huge pair of antlers branched 
immediately over the head of the 
youthful bridegroom. 
The cavalier took but little notice 
of the company or the entertainment. 
He scarcely tasted the banquet, but 
seemed absorbed in admiration of his 
bride. He conversed in a low tone 
that could not be overheard—for the 
language of love is never loud; but 
where is the female ear so dull that 
it cannot catch the softest, whisper 
of the lover? There was a * mingled 
tenderness and gravity in his manner, 
that appeared to have a powerful 
effect upon the young lady. Her color 
came and went as she listened with 
deep attention. Now and then she 
made some blushing reply, and when 
his eye was turned away, she would 
steal a sidelong glance at his romantic 
countenance, and heave a gentle sigh 
of tender happiness. It was evident 
that the young couple were completely 
enamored. The aunts, who were 
deeply versed in the mysteries of the 
heart, declared that they had fallen in 
love with each other at first sight. +

infected; whispers and glances were 
interchanged, accompanied by shrugs 
and dubious shakes of the head. The 
song and the laugh grew less and less 
frequent; there were dreary pauses 
in the conversation, which were at 
length succeeded by wild tales and’ 
supernatural legends. One dismal 
story produced another still more 
dismal, and the baron nearly fright- 
ened some of the ladies into hysterics 
with the history of the goblin horse- | 
man that carried away the fair 
Leonora; a dreadful story, which has 
since been: put into excellent verse, 
and is read and believed by all the 
world. 
The bridegroom listened to this tale 
with profound attention. He kept 
his eyes steadily fixed on the baron, 
and, as the story drew to a close, be- 
gan gradually to rise from his seat, 
growing taller and taller, until, in 
the baron’s entranced eye, he seemed 
almost to tower into a giant. The 
moment the tale was finished, he 
heaved a deep sigh, and took a solemn 
farewell of the company. They were 
all amazement. The baron was per- 
fectly thunderstruck. 
“What! going to leave the castle at 
midnight? why, everything was pre- 
pared for his reception; a chamber 
was ready for him if he wished to 
retire.” 
The stranger shook his head mourn- 
fully and mysteriously; “I must lay my’ 
head ina different chamber tonight!” 
There was something in this reply, 
and the tone in which it was uttered, 
that made the baron’s heart misgive 
him; but he rallied his forces, and 
repeated his hospitable entreaties. 
The stranger shook his head silently, 
but positively, at every offer; and, 
waving his farewell to the company, 
14. Leonora, a ballad by Birger which appeared 
in 1773, Sir Walter Scott_began his literary career with the translation into pag ish of this bs lad and 
other romantic German ballads of the peri stalked slowly out of the hall. The 
maiden aunts were absolutely petrified 
—the bride hung her head, and a tear 
stole to her eye. 50 
The baron followed the stranger 
to the great court of the castle, where 
the black charger stood pawing the 
earth, and snorting with impatience. 
When they had reached the portal 
whose deep archway was dimly lighted 
by a cresset, the stranger paused, and 
addressed the baron in a hollow tone 
of voice, which the vaulted roof 
rendered still more sepulchral. 60 
“Now that we are alone,” said he, 
“JT will impart to you the reason of 
my going. I have a solemn, an in- 
dispensable, engagement—” 
“Why,” said the baron, “cannot you 
send someone in your place?” 
“Tt admits of no substitute—I must 
attend it in person—I must away to 
Wurtzburg cathedral—” 
“Aye,” said the baron, plucking up 70 
spirit, “but not until tomorrow— 
tomorrow you shall take your bride 
there.” 
“No! no!” replied the stranger, with 
tenfold solemnity, “my engagement 
is with no bride—the worms! the 
worms expect me! I am a dead man— 
I have been slain by robbers—my 
body lies at Wurtzburg—at midnight 
Tam to be buried—the grave is waiting so 
for me—I must keep my appoint- 
ment!” 
He sprang on his black charger, 
dashed over the drawbridge, and the 
clattering of his horse’s hoofs was 
lost in the whistling of the night blast. 
The baron returned to the hall in 
the utmost consternation and related 
what had passed. Two ladies fainted 
outright, others sickened at the idea 90 
of having banqueted with a specter. 
It was the opinion of some that this 4, 
might be the wild huntsman, famous

ballad, “Der Wilde Jager,” is a popular figure im German legend.

in German legend. Some talked of 
mountain sprites, of wood-demons, 
and of other supernatural beings, with 
which the good people of Germany 
have been so grievously harassed 
since time immemorial. One of the 
poor relations ventured to suggest 
that it might be some sportive evasion 
of the young cavalier, and that the 
very gloominess of the caprice seemed 
to accord with so melancholy a per- 
sonage. This, however, drew on him 
the indignation of the whole company, 
and especially of the baron, who looked. 
upon him as little better than an 
infidel; so that he was fain to abjure 
his heresy as speedily as possible, and 
come into the faith of the true be- 
lievers. , 
But whatever may have been the 
doubts entertained, they were com- 
pletely put to an-end by the arrival, 
next day, of regular missives, con- 
firming the intelligence of the young 
count’s. murder, and his interment in 
‘Wurtzburg cathedral. 
The dismay at the castle may well 
be imagined. The baron shut. him- 
self up in his chamber. The guests, 
who had come to rejoice with him, 
could not think of abandoning him 
in his distress. They wandered about 
the courts, or collected in groups in 
the hall, shaking their heads and 
shrugging their shoulders, at the 
troubles of so good a man; and sat 
» longer than ever at table, and ate and 
40 drank more stoutly than ever, by 
way of keeping up their spirits. But 
the situation of the widowed bride 
was the most pitiable. To have lost 
a husband before she had even em- 
braced him—and such a husband! 
If the very specter could be so gracious 
and noble, what must have been the 
living man. She filled the house with 
lamentations. 
On the night of the second day of 
her widowhood, she had retired to THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
her chamber, accompanied by one of 
her aunts, who insisted on sleeping 
with her. The aunt, who was one of 
the best tellers of ghost stories in all 
Germany, had just been recounting 
one of her longest, and had fallen 
asleep in the very midst of it. The 
chamber was remote, and overlooked 
a small garden. The niece lay pen- 
sively gazing at the beams of the 
rising moon, as they trembled on the 
leaves of an aspen tree before the 
lattice. The castle clock had just 
tolled midnight, when a soft strain 
of music stole up from the garden. 
She rose hastily from her bed, and 
stepped lightly to the window. A 
tall figure stood among the shadows 
of the trees. As it raised its head, a 
beam of moonlight fell upon the 
countenance. Heaven and earth! she 
beheld the Specter Bridegroom! A 
loud shriek at that moment burst 
upon her ear, and her aunt, who had 
been awakened by the music, and 
had followed her silently to the 
window, fell into her arms. When 
she looked again, the specter had 
disappeared. 
Of the two females, the aunt now 
required the most soothing, for she 
was perfectly beside herself with 
terror. As to the young lady, there 
was something, even in the specter of 
her lover, that seemed endearing. 
There was still the semblance of 
manly beauty; and though the shadow 
of a man is but little calculated to 
satisfy the affections of a lovesick 
girl, yet, where the substance is not 
to be had, even that is consoling. 
The aunt declared she would! never 
sleep in that chamber again; the 
niece, for once, was refractor: 
declared as strongly that ‘she 
sleep in no other in the castl:

frightful story;. it is, however, still 
quoted in the neighborhood, as a 
memorable instance of female secrecy, 
that she kept it to herself for a whole 
* week; when she was suddenly ab- 
solved from all further restraint, by 
intelligence brought to the breakfast 
table one morning that the young 
2% lady was not to be found. Her room 
was empty—the bed had not been 
slept in—the window was open, and 
the bird had flown! 
The astonishment and concern with 
which the intelligence was received, 
can only be imagined by those who 
have witnessed the agitation which 
the mishaps of a great man cause 
among his friends. Even the poor 
30 relations paused for a moment from 
the indefatigable labors of the 
trencher; when the aunt, who had 
at first been struck speechless, wrung 
her hands, and shricked out, “The 
goblin! the goblin! she’s carried away 
by the goblin? 
In a few words she related, the 
fearful scene of the garden, and con- 
cluded that the specter must have 
Two -of the 
domestics corroborated the opinion, 
for they had heard the clattering of a 
horse’s hoofs down the mountain 
about midnight, and had no doubt 
that it was the specter on his black 
charger, bearing her away to the 
tomb. All present were struck with 
the direful probability; for events of 
the kind are extremely common in 31 
Germany, as many well authenticated 
histories bear witness. 
What a lamentable situation was 
that of the poor baron! What a heart- 
rending dilemma for a fond father, 
and a member of the great family of 
Katzenellenbogen! His-only daughter 
had either been rapt away to the 
grave, or he was to have some wood- 
demon for a son-in-law, and, per- 
chance, a troop of goblin grand - 
children. As usual, he was completely 
bewildered, and all the castle in an 
uproar. The men were ordered to 
take horse, and scour every road and 
path and glen of the Odenwald. The 
baron himself had just drawn on 
his jack-boots, girded on his sword, 
and was about to mount his steed 
to sally forth on the doubtful quest, 
when he was brought to a pause by a 
new apparition. A lady was seen 
approaching the castle, mounted ora 
palfrey, attended by a cavalier on 
horseback. She galloped up to the 
gate, sprang from her horse, and 
falling at the baron’s feet, embraced ‘50. 
his knees. It was his lost daughter, 
and her companion—the Specter | 
Bridegroom! The baron was as- 
tounded. He looked at his daughter, 
then at the specter, and almost 
doubted the evidence of his senses. 
The latter, too, was wonderfully im- 
proved in his appearance since his 
visit to the world of spirits. His 
dress was splendid, and set off a noble 
figure of manly symmetry. He was 
no longer pale and melancholy. His 
fine countenance was flushed with the 
glow of youth, and joy rioted in his 
large dark eye. 
The mystery was soon cleared up. 
The cavalier (for, in truth, as you 
must have known all the while, he 
was no goblin). announced himself as 
Sir Herman Von Starkenfaust. He 
related his adventure with the young 
count. He told how he had hastened 80 
Bee
-P-A-G-E-41

30 82 
to the castle to deliver the unwelcome 
tidings, but that the eloquence of the 
baron had interrupted him in every 
attempt to tell his tale. How the 
sight of the bride had completely 
captivated him, and that to pass a 
few hours near her, he had tacitly 
suffered the mistake to continue. 
How he had been sorely perplexed in 
what way to make a decent retreat, 
until the baron’s goblin stories had 
suggested his eccentric ‘exit. How, 
fearing the feudal hostility of the 
family, he had repeated his visits by 
stealth—had haunted the garden be- 
neath the young lady’s window—had 
wooed—had won—had borne away 
in triumph—and, in a word, had 
wedded the fair. 
Under any other circumstances the 
baron would have been inflexible, for 
he was tenacious of paternal authority, 
and devoutly obstinate in all family 
feuds; but he loved his daughter; he 
had lamented her as lost; he rejoiced 
to find her still alive; and, though 
her husband was of a hostile house, 
yet, thank Heaven, he was not a 
goblin. There was something, it must

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1, “The Specter Bridegroom” is a part of 
Irving’s best known work, The Sketch Book, 
first published in 1819-1820. As the name in- 
dicates, The Sketch Book was made up of a series 
of short papers; they were written in England 
and published in seven parts, or numbers, 
between May, 1819, and September, 1820. Irv- 
ing had already written his Knickerbocker’s 
History of New York when he went to London 
on business for his brother, and devoted his 
leisure to visiting famous places, reading old 
legends, and writing. In the first number of 
The Sketch Book, published in America under 
the pen-name of Geoffrey Crayon, “Rip Van 
Winkle” was included. “The Specter Bride- 
groom” appeared in the fourth number, “The 
Legend of Sleepy Hollow” in the fifth, and “Philip of Pokanoket” : 
of the essays. Beside: 
foreign legends, he also '

we now read in the “Specter Bridegroom.” 
2. Irving’s note on page 22 gives the source 
of the tale as “a little French anecdote.” As a 
matter of fact, the story is based on a widely 
known superstition, found in many ballads and 
romances, about a dead lover who returns to 
claim his bride. This tragic theme Irving here
-P-A-G-E-42
| THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
alters in a most effective manner. There is 
enough suggestion of the supernatural and the 
weird to’ interest the reader in this aspect of 
the old superstition, while the whole story is 
altered, by skillful handling, into a romance 
with a happy ending. You should give atten- 
tion, then, to two points in your study of the 
plot: first, to tracing the old plot, the return of 
the ghostly lover; and, second, to study of the 
means.by which Irving grafts his new plot upon 
this old foundation. 
QUESTIONS AND Topics 
1. Some qualities of Irving’s style are well 
shown in this story. His humor, particularly in 
his description of persons, should be studied, 
and may be compared with character-descrip- 
‘tion in other sketches you have read. For 
example, make a list of the words that show 
what the baron looked like. In the same way, 
list words and phrases that show what kind of 
man he was. What was your first thought 
about the identity of the stranger? ‘Did you 
think, at any time, that it really was the ghost 
of the suitor? . What sentence seemed to promise 
that the ghost would come back? In the ac- 
count of the evening’s festivities, note how the 33 
melancholy of the stranger is made clear, pro- 
gressively, What circumstances increase this 
feeling not only in the stranger but in the 
reader? 
%. Study the mixture of weirdness and 
humor throughout the story. Draw up in 
parallel columns a set of phrases or catch-words 
that will make this balance plain to you. 
3. Study the transitions from one part of 
the story to another. How miany such sections 
are there? How does Irving pass from one to 
another? Draw up an outline of the plot so as 
to make these transitions clear, and tell the 
story briefly, following this outline. 
4. Study the dénouement, or solution of the 
plot, carefully. Make a note of the steps in this 
solution. Does the element of surprise come in? 
At what point in the story did you first realize 
how it was to come out? Note any elements 
that helped to this conclusion, such as the stress 
on the obedient character of the heroine; the 
fact that she had never seen the man she was 
to marry; the opportunity the stranger had to 
woo her before revealing his identity. There 
are other similar elements scattered through the 
story. By studying them you will see how care- 
fully 2 good short story is planned by the author. 
“THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
Epison MarsHati 
I 
An elephant is old on the day he is 
born, say the natives of Burma, and 
no white man is ever quite sure just 
what they mean. Perhaps they refer 
to his pink, old-gentleman’s skin and 
his droll; fumbling, old-man ways and 
his squeaking, treble voice. And may- 
be they mean he is born with a wisdom 
such as usually belongs only to age. 
And it is true that if any animal in the 
world has had a-chance to acquire 
knowledge it is the elephant, for his 
breed are the oldest: residents of this 
old world. 
They are so old that they don’t 
seem to belong to the twentieth cen- 
tury at all. Their long trunks, their 
huge shapes, all seem part of the re- mote past. They are just remnants 
of a breed that once was great. ~ 
Long and long ago, when the world 
was very young indeed, when the 
mountains were new, and before the 
descent of the great glaciers taught 
the meaning of cold, they were the 
rulers of the earth, but they have 
been conquered in the struggle for 
existence. Their great cousins, the 
mastodon and the mammoth, are 
completely gone, and their own tribe 
can now be numbered by thousands. 
But because they have been so long 
upon the earth, because they have 
wealth of experience beyond all other 
creatures, they seem like venerable 
sages in a world of children. They 
are like the last veterans of an old 30
-P-A-G-E-43

’ war, who can remember scenes and 
10 faces that all others have forgotten. 
Far in a remote section of British 
India, in a strange, wild province 
called Burma, Muztagh was born. 
And although he was born in captivity, 
the property of a mahout, in his first 
hour he heard the far-off call of the 
wild elephants in the jungle. 
The Burmans, just like the other 
people of India, always watch the first 
hour of a baby’s life very closely. 
They know that always some incident 
will occur that will point, as a weather- 
vane points in the wind, to the baby’s 
future. Often they have to call a 
man versed in magic to interpret, but 
sometimes the prophecy is quite self- 
evident. No one knows whether or 
not it works the same with baby ele- 
phants, but certainly this wild, far- 
carrying call, not to be imitated by 
any living voice, did seem a token and 
an omen in the life of Muztagh. And 
it is a curious fact that the little baby 
lifted his ears at the sound and rocked 
back and forth on his pillar legs. 
Of all the places in the great world, 
only a few remain wherein a captive 
elephant hears the call of his wild 
brethren at birth. Muztagh’s birth- 
place lies around the corner of the 
Bay of Bengal, not far from the water- 
shed of the Irrawaddy, almost north of 
Java. It is strange and wild and dark 
beyond the power of words to tell. 
There are great dark forests, unknown, 
slow-moving rivers, and jungles silent 
and dark and impenetrable. 
Little Muztagh weighed a flat two 
hundred pounds at birth. But this 
was not the queerest thing about him. 
Elephant babies, although usually 
weighing not more than one hundred 
and eighty, often touch two hundred. 
The queerest thing was a peculiarity 
that probably was completely over-

bonds, such as you will wear too, 
after the next drive!” 
They trumpeted again, as if in 
scorn of his words. Their great 
strength was given them to rule the 
jungle, not to haul logs and pull 
chains! The man turned back to the 
lines and lifted higher his light. 
Yes—the little elephant in the light- 
glow. was of the Kumiria. Never had 
there been a more perfect calf. The 
light of greed sprang again in his eyes. 
And as he held the fagot nearer so 
that the beams played in the elephant’s 
eyes and on his coat, the mahout sat 
down and was still, lest the gods ob- 
serve his good luck, and, being jealous, 
turn it into evil. 
The coat was not pinky dark, as is 
usual in baby elephants. It was dis- 
tinctly light-colored—only a few de- 
grees darker than white. 
The man understood at once. In 
the elephants, as well as in all other 
breeds, an albino is sometimes born. 
A perfectly white elephant, up to a 
few years ago, had never been seen, 
but on rare occasions elephants are 
born with light-colored or clouded 
tides. Such creatures are bought at 
abulous prices by the Malay and 
siamese princes, to whom a white 
lephant is the greatest treasure that 
. king can possess. 
Muztagh was a long way from being 
m albino, yet a tendency in that di- 
ection had bleached his hide. And 
he man knew. that on the morrow 
Dugan Sahib would pay him a life- 
ime’s earnings for the little wabbly 
calf, whose welcome, had been the wild 
ties of the tuskers in the jungler 
I 
Little Muztagh, which means White 
Mountain in an ancient tongue, did 
not enjoy his babyhood at all. He 35 
was born with the memory of jungle 
kingdoms, and the life in the elephant 
lines almost killed him with dullness. 
There was never anything to do but 
nurse of the strong elephant milk and 
roam about in the keddah or along the 
lines. He had been bought the second 
day of his life by Dugan Sahib, and 
the great white heaven-born saw to it 
that he underwent none of the risks 
that are the happy fate of most baby 
elephants. His mother was not taken 
on the elephant drives into the jungles, 
so he never got a taste of this exciting 
sport. Mostly she was kept. chained 
in the lines, and every day Langur 
Dass, the low-caste hillman in Dugan’s 
employ, grubbed grass for her in the 
valleys. All night long, except the 
regular four hours of sleep, he would 
hear her grumble and rumble and 
mutter discontent that her little son 
shared with her. 
Muztagh’s second year was little 
better. Of course he had reached the 
age where he could eat such dainties as 
grass and young sugar cane, but these 
things could not make up for the fun 
he was missing in the hills. He would 
stand long hours watching their purple. 
tops against the skies, and his little 
dark eyes would glow. He would see 
the storms break and flash above 
them, behold the rains lash down 
through the jungles, and he was always 
filled with strange longings and desires 
that he was too young to understand 
or to follow. He would see the white 
haze steam up from the labyrinth 
of wet vines, and he would tingle and 
scratch for the feel of its wetness on 
his skin. And often, when the mys- 
terious Burman night came down, it 
seemed to him that he would go mad. 
He would hear the wild tuskers trum- 
peting in the jungles a very long way off, 
and all the myriad noises of the mys- 
terious night, and at such times even 
his mother looked at him with wonder.

“Oh, little restless one,” Langur 
Dass would say, “thou and that old 
cow thy mother and I have one heart 
between us. We know the burning— 
we understand, we three!”’ 
It was true that Langur Dass un- 
derstood more of the ways of the 
forest people than any other hillman 
in the encampment. But his caste 
was low, and he was drunken and 
careless and lazy beyond words, and 
the hunters had mostly only scorn for 
him. They called him Langur after a 
graybearded breed of monkeys along 
the slopes of the Himalayas, rather 
suspecting he was cursed with evil 
spirits, for why should any sane man 
have such mad ideas as to the rights of 
elephants? He never wanted to join 
in the drives—which was a strange 
thing indeed for a man raised in the 
hills. Perhaps he was afraid—but 
yet they could remember a certain 
day in the bamboo thickets, when a 
great wild buffalo had charged their 
camp, and Langur Dass acted as if fear 
were something he had never heard 
of and knéw nothing whatever about. 
One day they asked ‘him about it. 
“Tell us, Langur Dass,” they asked, 
mocking the ragged, dejected-looking 
creature, “if thy name speaks truth, 
thou art brother to many monkey- 
folk, and who knows the jungle better 
than thou or they? None but the 
monkey-folk and thou canst talk with 
my lord the elephant. Hai! -We 
have seen thee do it, Langur Dass. 
How is it that when we go hunting, 
thou art afraid to come?” ’ 
Langur looked at them out of his 
dull eyes, and evaded their question 
just as long as he could. “Have you 
forgotten the tales you heard on your 
mothers’ breasts?” he asked at last. 
“Elephants are of the jungle. You 
are of the cooking-pots and thatch! 
How should such folk as ye are under-

8 THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
‘which the little Muztagh acquired 
weight and strength. He outweighed, 
at the age of three, any calf of his 
season in the encampment by a full 
two hundred pounds. And of course 
three in-an elephant is no older than 
three in a human child. He was still 
just a baby, even if he did have the 
wild tuskers’ love of liberty. 
“Shalt thou never lie the day long in 
the cool mud, little one? Never see 
a storm break on the hills? Nor feel 
a warm rain dripping through the 
branches? Or are these matters part 
of thee that none may steal?’ Langur 
Dass would ask him, contented to 
wait a very long time for his answer. 
“TJ think already that thou knowest 
how the tiger steals away at thy shrill 
note; how thickets feel that crash 
beneath thy hurrying weight. A little 
I think thou knowest how the madness 
comes with the changing seasons. 
How knowest thou these things? Not 
as I know them, who have seen—nay, 
but as a king knows conquering; it’s 
in thy blood! Is a bundle of sugar 
cane tribute enough for thee, Kumiria? 
Shall purple trappings please thee? 
Shall some fat rajah of the plains 
make a, beast of burden of thee? An- 
swer, lord of mighty memories!” 
And Muztagh answered in his own 
way, without sound or emphasis, but 
giving his love to Langur Dass, a love 
as large as the big elephant heart from 
which it had sprung. No other man 
could even win his friendship. The 
smell of the jungle was on Langur 
Dass. The mahouts and hunters 
smelled more or less of civilization 
and were convinced for their part that 
the disposition of the little light- 
colored elephant was beyond redemp- 
tion. 
“He is a born rogue,” was their 
verdict, and they meant by that, a 
particular kind of elephant, sometimes 
a young male, more often an old and 87 
savage tusker, alone in the jungle— 
apart from the herd.  Solitariness 
doesn’t imprové their dispositions, 
and they were generally. expelled from 
a herd for ill-temper to begin with. 
“Woe to the fool prince who buys 
this one!” said the graybeard catchers. 
“There is murder in his eyes.” 
But Langur Dass would only look 
wise when he heard these remarks. 
He knew elephants. The gleam in the 
dark eyes of Muztagh was not vicious- 
ness, but simply inheritance, a love 
of the wide wild spaces that left no 
room for ordinary friendships. 
But calf-love and mother-love bind 
other animals as well as men, and 
possibly he might have perfectly ful- 
filled the plans Dugan had made for 
him but for a mistake the sahib made 
in the little calf’s ninth year. 
He sold Muztagh’s mother to an 
elephant-breeder from a distant prov- 
ince. Little Muztagh saw her march 
away between two tuskers—down the 
long elephant trail into the valley and 
the shadow. 
“Watch the little one closely to- 
night,” Dugan Sahib said to his 
mahout.” So when they had led him 
back and forth along the lines, they 
saw that the ends of his ropes were 
pegged down tightly. They were 
horsehair ropes, far beyond the 
strength of any normal nine-year- 
old elephant to break. Then they 
went to the huts and to their women 
and left him to shift restlessly from 
foot to foot and think. 
Probably he would have been satis- 
fied with thinking, for Muztagh did 
not know his strength, and thought 
he was securely tied. The incident 
that upset the mahout’s plans was 
simply that the wild elephants trum- 
peted again from the hills. 
Muztagh heard the sound, long 
drawn and strange from the silence 
of the jungle. He grew motionless. 50

The great ears pricked forward, the 
whipping tail stood still. It was a 
eall never to be denied. The blood 
was leaping in his great. veins. 
He suddenly rocked forward with 
all his strength. The rope spun 
tight, hummed, and snapped—very 
softly indeed. Then he padded in 
silence out among the huts, and no- 
body who had not seen him do it 
would believe how silently an elephant 
can move when he sees fit. 
There was no thick jungle here— 
just soft grass huts, approaching dark 
fringe that was the jungle. None of 
the mahouts was awake to see him. 
No voice called him back. The grass 
gave way to bamboo thickets, the 
smell of the huts to the wild, bewitch- 
ing perfumes of the jungle. 
Then, still in silence, because there 
are decencies to be observed by ani- 
mals no less than men, he walked 
forward with his trunk outstretched 
into the primordial jungle and was 
born again. 
it 
Muztagh’s reception was cordial 
from the very first. The great bulls 
of the herd stood still and lifted their 
ears when they heard him grunting . 
up the hill. But he slipped among 
them and was forgotten at once. 
They had no dealings with the princes 
of Malay and Siam, and his light- 
colored coat meant nothing whatever 
to them. If they did any thinking 
about him at all, it was just to wonder 
why a calf with all the evident marks 
of a nine-year-old should be so tall 
and weigh so much. 
One can fancy that the great old 
wrinkled tusker that led the herd 
peered at him now and then out of his 
little red eyes, and wondered. A 
herd-leader begins to think about 
future contestants for his place as soon 
as he acquires the leadership. But THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

young males just learning their 
strength and proud of it beyond 
words, and many calves. They ranged 
all the way in size from the great 
leader, who stood ten feet and weighed. 
nearly nine thousand pounds, to little 
two-hundred-and-fifty-pound babies 
that had been born that season. And 
before long the entire herd began its 
cautious advance into the deeper hills. 
The first night in the jungle—and 
Muztagh found it wonderful beyond 
all dreams. ‘The mist on his skin was 
the same cool joy he had expected. 
There were sounds, too, that set his 
great muscles aquiver. He heard the 
sound that the bamboos make-—-the 
little click-click. of the stems in the 
wind—the soft rustle and stir of many 
leafy tendrils entwining and touching 
together, and the whisper of the wind. 
over the jungle grass. And he knew, 
because it was his heritage, what 
every single one of these sounds meant. 
The herd threaded through the 
dark jungle, and now they descended 
into a cool river. A herd of deer— 
either the dark sambur or black buck 
—sprang from the misty shore-line 
and leaped away into the bamboos, 
Farther down, he could hear the grunt 
of buffalo. 
It was simply a caress—the touch 
of the soft, cool water on his flanks, 
Then they reared out, like great sea 
gods rising from the deep, and grunted, 
and squealed their way up the banks 
into the jungle again. 
But the smells were the book that 
he read best; he understood them even, 
better than the sounds of green things 
growing. Flowers that he could not 
see hung like bells from the arching 
branches. Every, fern and every seed-
-P-A-G-E-48
THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
ing grass had its own scent that told 
sweet tales. The very mud that his 
four feet sank into emitted scent that 
told the history of jungle-life from the 
world’s beginnings. ‘When dawn burst - 
over the eastern hills, he was weary in 
every muscle of his young body, but 
much too happy to admit it. 
This day was just the first of three 
thousand joyous days. The jungle, 
old as the world itself, is ever new. 
Not even the wisest elephant, who, 
after all, is king of the jungle, knows 
what will turn up at the next bend in 
the elephant trail. It may be a native 
woodcutter, whose long hair is stirred 
with fright. It may easily be one of 
the great breed of bears, large as the 
American grizzly, that some naturalists 
believe are to be found in the Siamese 
and Burman jungles. It may be a 
herd of wild buffalo, always looking for 
a fight, or simply some absurd arma- 
dillo-like thing, to make him shake 
his vast sides with mirth. 
The herd was never still. They 
ranged from one mysterious hill to 
another, to the ranges of the Hima- 
layas and back again. There were 
no rivers that they did not swim, no 
jungles that they did not penetrate, 
no elephant trails that they did not 
follow, in the whole northeastern 
corner of British India. And all the 
time Muztagh’s strength grew upon 
him until it became too vast a thing 
to measure or control. 
Whether or not he kept with the 
herd was by now a matter of supreme 
indifference to him.. He no longer 
needed its protection. Except for the 
men who came with the ropes and 
guns and shoutings, there was nothing 
in the jungle for him to fear. He was 
twenty years old, and he stood nearly 
eleven feet to the top of his shoulders. 
He would have broken any scales in the 
Indizad Empire that tried to weigh 
im. 39 
He had had his share of adventures, 
yet he knew that life in reality had 
just begun. The time would come 
when he would want to fight the great, 
arrogant bull for the leadership of the 
herd. He was tired of fighting the 
young bulls of his own age. He al- 
ways won, and to an elephant con- 
stant winning is almost -as dull as 
constant losing. He was a great deal 
like a youth of twenty in any breed 
of any land—light-hearted, self-confi- 
dent, enjoying every minute of wake- 
fulness between one midnight and 
another. He loved thejungle smells and 
the jungle sounds, and he could even 
tolerate the horrible laughter of the 
hyenas that sometimes tore to shreds 
the silence of the grassy plains below. 
But India is too thickly populated 
by human beings for a wild elephant 
to escape observation entirely. Many 
natives had caught sight of him, and 
at last the tales reached a little circle 
of trackers and hunters in camp on a 
distant range of hills. They did not 
work for Dugan Sahib, for Dugan 
Sahib was dead long since. They 
were a determined little group, and 
one night they sat and talked softly 
over their fire. If Muztagh’s ears 
had been sharp enough to hear their 
words across the space of hills, he 
wouldn’t have gone to his mud-baths 
with such complacency the next day. 
But the space between them was 
fifty miles of sweating jungle, and of 
course he did not hear. 
“You will go, Khusru,” said the 
leader, “for there are none here half 
so skillful with horsehair rope as you. 
If you do not come back within 
twelve months we shall know you 
have failed.” 
Of course all of them knew what he 
meant. If a man failed in the effort 
to capture a wild elephant by the 
hair-rope method, he very rarely lived 
to tell of it. 56
-P-A-G-E-49

“In that case,” Ahmad Din went 
on, “there will be a great drive after 
the monsoon of next year. Picked 
men will be chosen. No detail will 
be overlooked. It will cost more, 
but it will be sure. And our purses 
will be fat from the selling-price of 
this king of elephants with a white 
coat!” 
IV 
There is no need to follow Khusru 
on his long pursuit through the ele- 
phant trails. He was an able hunter 
and, after the manner of the elephant- 
trackers, the scared little man followed 
Muztagh through jungle and river, 
over hill and into dale, for countless 
days, and at last, as Muztagh slept, 
he crept up within a half-dozen feet 
of him. He intended to loop a horse- 
hair rope about his great feet—one of 
the oldest and most hazardous meth- 
ods of elephant-catching. But Muz- 
tagh wakened just in time. 
And then a curious thing happened. 
The native could never entirely believe 
it, and it was one of his best stories to 
the day he died. Any other wild 
tusker would have charged in furious 
wrath, and there would have been a 
quick and certain death beneath his 
great knees. Muztagh started out as 
if he had intended to charge. He 
lifted his trunk out of the way—the 
elephant trunk is for a thousand uses, 
but fighting is not one of them—and 
sprang forward. He went just two 
paces. Then his little eyes caught 
sight of the brown figure fleeing 
through the bamboos. And at once 
the elephant set his great feet to 
brake himself, and drew to a sliding 
halt six feet beyond. 
He did not know why. He was 
perféctly aware that this man was an 
enemy, jealous of his most-loved 
liberty. He knew perfectly it was 
the man’s intention to put him back THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
into his bonds. He did not feel fear, 
either—because an elephant’s anger is 
too tremendous an emotion to leave 
room for any other impulse such as 
fear. It seemed to him that memories 
came thronging from long ago, so real 
and insistent that he could not think 
of charging. 
He remembered his days in the 
elephant lines.. These brown creatures 
had been his masters then. They had 
cut his grass for him in the jungle, 
and brought him bundles of sugar 
eane. The hill people say that the 
elephant memory is the greatest single 
marvel in the jungle, and it was that 
memory that saved Khusru then. It 
wasn’t deliberate gratitude for the 
grass-cutting of long ago. It wasn’t 
any particular emotion that he could 
reach out his trunk and touch. It 
was simply an impulse—another one 
of the thousand mysteries that en- 
velop, like a cloud, the mental proc- 
esses of these largest of forest crea- 
tures. 
These were the days when he lived 
apart from the herd. He did it from 
choice. He liked the silence, the 
solitary mud-baths, the constant 
watchfulness against danger. 
One day a rhino charged him— 
without warning or reason. This is 
quite a common thing for a rhino to 
do. They have the worst tempers in 
the jungle, and they would just as 
soon charge a mountain if they didn’t 
like the look of it. Muztagh had 
awakened the great creature from his 
sleep, and he came bearing down like 
a tank over ‘‘no man’s land.” 
Muztagh met him squarely, with the 
full shock of his tusks, and the battle 
ended promptly. Muztagh’s tusk, 
driven by five tons of might behind 
it, would have pierced a ship’s side, 
and the rhino limped away to let his 
hurt grow well and meditate revenge. 
Thereafter, for a full year, he looked

THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
varefully out of his bleary, drunken 
syes and’ chose a smaller objective 
vefore he charged. 
Month after month Muztagh 
vended alone through the elephant 
rails, and now and then rooted up 
reat trees just to try his strength. 
Sometimes he went silently, and 
‘ometimes. like an avalanche. He 
wam alone in the deep holes, and 
ometimes shut his eyes and stood on 
he bottom, just keeping the end of 
lis trunk out of the water. One day 
1e was obliged to kneel on the broad 
rack of an alligator who tried to bite 
of his foot. He drove the long body 
lown into the muddy bottom, and 
10 living creature, except possibly 
he catfish that burrow in the mud, 
‘ver saw it again. 
He loved the rains that flashed 
hrough the jungles, the swift-climbing 
lawns in the east, the strange, tense, 
owreathless nights. And at midnight 
1e loved to trumpet to the herd on 
ome far-away hill, and hear, fainter 
han the death-cry of a beetle, its 
mswer come back tohim. At twenty- 
ive he had reached full maturity; and- 
10 more magnificent specimen of the 
‘lephant could be found in all of 
3ritish India. At last he had begun 
to learn his strength. 
Of course he had known for years 
his mastery over the inanimate things 
of the ‘world. He knew how easy it 
was to tear a tree from its roots, to 
jerk a great tree-limb from its socket. 
He knew that under most conditions 
he had nothing to fear from the great 
tigers, although a fight with a tiger 
is a painful thing and well to avoid. 
But he did not know that he had 
developed a craft and skill that would 
avail him in battle against the greatest 
of his own kind. He made the discov- 
ery one sunlit day beside the Manipur 
River. . : 
He was in the mud-bath, grunting 
a 41 
and bubbling with content. It was a 
bath with just room enough for one. 
And seeing that he was young, and 
perhaps failing to measure his size, 
obscured as it was in the mud, a 
great “rogue” bull came out of the 
jungle to take the bath for himself. 
He was a huge creature—wrinkled 
and _ yellow-tusked and scarred from 
the wounds of a thousand fights. 
THis little red eyes looked out ma- 
lignantly, and he grunted all the in- 
sults the elephant tongue can compass 
to the youngster that lolled in the 
bath. He confidently expected that 
Muztagh would yield at once, because 
as a rule young twenty-five-year-olds 
do not care to mix in battle with the 
scarred and crafty veterans of sixty 
years. But he did not know Muztagh. 
The latter had been enjoying the 
bath to the limit, and he had no 
desire whatever to give it up. Some- 
thing hot and raging seemed to ex- 
plode in his brain and it was as if a 
red glare, such as sometimes comes in 
the sunset, had fallen over all the 
stretch of river and jungle before his 
eyes. He squealed once, reared up 
with one lunge out of the bath—and 
charged. They met with a shock. 
Of all the expressions of power in the 
animal world, the elephant fight is the 
most terrible to see. It is as if two 
mountains rose up from their roots 
of strata and went to war. It is ter- 
rible to hear, too. The jungle had 
been still before. The river glided 
softly, the wind was dead, the mid- 
afternoon silence was over the thickets. 
The jungle people were asleep. A 
thunderstorm would not have broken 
more quickly, or could not have 
created a wilder pandemonium. The 
jungle seemed to shiver with the 
sound. 
They squealed and bellowed and 
trumpeted and grunted and charged. 
Their tusks clicked like the noise of a 50 r ae

giant’s game of billiards. The thickets 
crackled and broke beneath their 
great feet. © 
It lasted only a moment. It was 
so easy, after all. In a very few sec- 
onds indeed, the old rogue became 
aware that he had made a very dan- 
gerous and disagreeable mistake. 
There were better mud-baths on the 
river, anyway. : 
He had not been able to land a 
single blow. And his wrath gave way 
to startled amazement when Muztagh 
sent home his third. The rogue did 
not wait for the fourth. 
Muztagh chased him into the thick- 
ets. But he was too proud to chase 
a beaten elephant for long. He 
halted, trumpeting, and swung back 
to his mud-bath.° 
But he did not enter the mud again. 
All at once he remembered the herd 
and the fights of his calfhood. All 
at once he knew that his craft and 
strength and power were beyond that 
of any elephant in all the jungle. Who 
was the great, arrogant herd-leader 
to stand against him? What yellow 
tusks were to meet his and come away 
unbroken? 
His little eyes grew ever more red as 
he stood rocking back and forth, his 
trunk lifted to catch the sounds and 
smells of the distant jungle. Why 
should he abide alone when he could 
be the ruler of the herd and the jungle 
king? Then he grunted softly and 
started away down the river. Far 
away, beyond the mountains and 
rivers and the villages of the hill folk, 
the herd of his youth roamed in joy- 
ous freedom. He would find them 
and assert his mastery. 
Vv 
The night fire of a little band of 
elephant-catchers burned fitfully at 
the edge of the jungle. They were 
silent men—for they had lived long THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
on the elephant trails—and ‘curiously 
scarred and somber. They smoked 
their cheroots and waited for Ahmad 
Din to speak. 
“You have all heard?” he asked at 
last. . 
All but one of them nodded. Of 
course this did not count the most 
despised one of them all—old Langur 
Dass—who sat at the very edge of the 
shadow. His long hair was gray, and | 
his youth had gone where the sun 
goes at evening. They scarcely ad- 
dressed a word to him, or he to them. 
_True, he knew the elephants, but was 
he not possessed of evil spirits? He 
was always without rupees, too, a; 
creature of the wild that could not 
seem to understand the gathering of 
money. As a man, according to the 
standards of men, he was an abject 
failure. 
“Khusru has failed to cate! 
Skin, but he has lived to tell 1 
about it. He comes tonight.” 
It was noticeable that Langur Dass, 
at the edge of the circle, pricked up 
his ears. 
“Do you mean the white elenhant of | 
which the Manipur people te 
lies?” he asked. “Do ye

  THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 43 
Langur Dass’s face lit suddenly. 
“Then it could be none but Muztagh, 
escaped from Dugan Sahib fifteen 
years ago. That calf was also white. 
He was also overgrown for his years.” 
One of the trackers suddenly gasped. 
“Then that is why he spared Khusru!” 
he cried. “He remembered men.” 
The others nodded gravely. “They 
never forget,” said Langur Dass. , 
“You will be silent while I speak,” 
Ahmad Din went on. Langur grew 
silent as commanded, but his thoughts - 
were flowing backward twenty years, 
to days at the elephant lines in distant 
hills. Muztagh was the one living 
creature that in all his days had loved 
Langur Dass. The man shut his eyes, 
and his limbs seemed to relax as if 
he had lost all interest in the talk. 
The evil one took hold of him at such 
times, the people said, letting under- 
standing follow his thoughts back into 
the purple hills and the far-off spaces 
of the jungle. But tonight he was 
only pretending. He meant to hear 
every word of the talk before he left 
the circle. . 
“He tells a mad story, as you know, 
of the elephant sparing him when he 
was beneath his feet,” Ahmad Din went 
on; “that part of his story does not 
matter to us. Hai! He might have 
been frightened enough to say that 
the sun set atnoon. But what matters 
to us more is that he knows where the 
herd is—but a day’s journey beyond 
the river. And there is no time to be 
lost.” 
His fellows nodded in agreement. 
“So tomorrow we will break camp. 
_ There can be no mistake this time. 
There must be no points overlooked. 
The chase will cost much, but it will 
return a hundredfold. Khusru says 
that at last the white one has started 
back toward his herd, so that all can 
> be taken in the same keddak. And the 
, white sahib that holds the license is not to know that White-Coat is in the 
herd at all” 
The circle nodded again, and con- 
tracted toward the speaker. 
“We will hire beaters and drivers, 
the best that can be found. Tomor- 
row we will take the elephants and go.” 
Langur Dass pretended to waken. 
“T have gone hungry many days,” he 
said. “If the drive is on, perhaps you 
will give your servant-a place among 
the beaters.” 
The circle turned and stared at him. 
It was one of the stories of Langur Dass 
that he never partook in the elephant 
hunts. Evidently poor living had 
broken his resolution. 
“You shall have your wish, if you 
know how to keep a closed mouth,” 
Ahmad Din replied. “There are other 
hunting parties in the hills.” 
Langur nodded. He was very adept 
indeed at keeping a closed mouth. It 
is one of the first lessons of the jungle. 
For another long hour they sat and 
perfected their plans. Then they 
lay down by the fire together, and 
sleep dropped over them one by one. 
. At last Langur sat by the fire alone. 
“You will watch the flame tonight,” 
Ahmad Din ordered. ‘We did not 
feed you tonight for pity on your gray 
hairs. And remember—a gypsy died 
in a tiger’s claws on this very slope— 
not six months past.” 
Langur Dass was left alone with 
his thoughts. ‘Soon he got up and stole 
out into the velvet darkness. 
mists were over the hills as always. 
“Have I followed the tales of your 
greatness all these years for this?” he 
muttered. “It is right for pigs with 
the hearts of pigs to break their backs 
in labor. But you, my Muztagh! 
Jewel among elephants! King of the 
jungle! Thou art.of the true breed! 
Moreover, I am minded that thy heart 
and mine are one!

after thy time, Muztagh,” he went on. 
“Thou art of.the breed of niasters, not 
of. slaves! Can I not understand? 
These are not my people—these brown 
men. about the fire. I have not thy 
strength, Muztagh, or I would be out 
there with thee! Yet is not the say- 
ing that brother shall serve brother?” 
He turned slowly back to the circle 
of the firelight. Then his brown, 
scrawny fingers clenched. 
“Am I to desert my brother in his 
hour of need? Am I to see these brown 
pigs put chains around him, in the 
moment of his power? A king, fall- 
ing to the place of a slave? Muztagh, 
we will see what can be done! Muz- 
tagh, my king, my pearl, my pink 
baby, for whom I dug grass in the 
long ago! Thy Langur Dass is old, 
.and his whole strength is not that of 
thy trunk, and men look at him as a 
worm in the grass. But Hai! per- 
haps thou wilt find him an ally not 
to be despised!” 
VI 
The night had just fallen, moist 
and heavy, over the jungle, when 
Muztagh caught up with his herd. 
He found them in an open, grassy 
glade, encircled by hills, and they 
were all waiting, silent, as he sped 
down the hills toward them. They 
had heard him coming a long way. 
He was not attempting silence. The 
jungle people had not got out of his 
way. - 
“The old bull that led the herd, sev- = °° enty years of age and at the pride of 
his wisdom and _ strength, scarred, 
yellow-tusked, and noble past any 
elephant patriarch in the jungle, 
curled up his trunk when he saw him 
come. He knew very well what 
would happen. And because no one 
knows better than the jungle people 
what a good thing it is to take the 
offensive in all battles, and because THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
it was fitting his place and dignity, 
he uttered the challenge himself. 
The silence dropped as something 
from the sky. The little pink calves, 
who had never seen the herd grow still 
in this same way before, felt the dawn 
of the storm that they could not under- 
stand, and took shelter beneath their 
mothers’ bellies. But they did not 
squeal. The silence was too deep for 
them to dare to break. 
It is always an epoch in the life of 
the herd when a young bull contests 
for leadership. It is a much more 
serious thing than in the herds of deer 
and buffalo. The latter only live a 
handful of years, then grow weak and 
die. A great bull who has attained

-P-A-G-E-54
S 
  THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
expected to do the challenging him- 
self. The fact that the leader had 
done it shook his self-confidence to 
some slight degree. Evidently the 
old leader still felt able to handle any 
young and arrogant bulls that desired 
his place. 
‘Then the herd began to shift. The 
cows drew back with their calves, the 
bulls surged forward, and slowly they 
made a hollow ring, not greatly dif- 
ferent from the pugilistic rmg known 
to fight-fans. The calves began to 
squeal, but their mothers silenced . 
them. Very slowly and grandly, with 
infinite dignity, Muztagh stamped into 
the circle. His tusks gleamed. His 
eyes glowed red. And those apprais- 
ing old bulls in the ring knew that 
such an elephant had not been born 
since the time of their grandfathers. 
They looked him over from tail to 
trunk. They marked the symmetrical 
form, the legs like mighty pillars, the 
sloping back, the wide-apart, intelli- 
gent eyes. THis shoulders were an 
expression of latent might—power to 
break a tree-trunk at its base; by the 
conformity of his muscles he was 
agile and quick as a tiger. And know- 
ing these things, and recognizing them, 
and honoring them, devotees of 
strength that they were, they threw 
their trunks in the air till they touched 
their foreheads and blared their full- 
voiced salute. 
They gave it the same instant—as 
musicians strike the same note at 
their leader’s signal. It was a perfect 
explosion of sound, a terrible blare, 
that crashed out through the jungles 
and wakened every sleeping thing. 
The dew fell from the trees. A great 
tawny tiger, lingering in hope of an 
elephant calf, slipped silently away. 
The sound rang true and loud to the 
surrounding hills and echoed and 
reéchoed softer and softer, until it 
was just a tiny tremor in the air. 45 
Not only the jungle-folk marveled at 
the sound. At an encampment three 
miles distant Ahmad Din and his men 
heard the wild call, and looked with 
wondering eyes upon each other. 
Then out of the silence spoke Langur 
Dass. 
“My lord Muztagh has come back 
to his herd—that is his salute,” he 
said. : 
Ahmad Din looked darkly about 
the circle. “And how long shall he 
stay?” he asked. 
The trap was almost ready. 
hour to strike had almost come. 
Meanwhile the grand old leader 
stamped into the circle, seeming un- 
conscious of the eyes upon him, 
battle-scarred and old. Even if this 
fight were his last, he meant to pre- 
serve his dignity. 
Again the salute sounded—shatter- 
ing out like a thunderclap over the 
jungle. Then challenger and chal- 
lenged closed. 
At first the watchers were silent. 
Then as the battle grew ever fiercer 
and more terrible, they began to grunt 
and squeal, surging back and forth, 
stamping the earth and crashing the 
underbrush. All the jungle-folk for 
miles about knew what was occurring. 
And Ahmad Din wished his keddah 
were completed, for never could there 
be a better opportunity to surround 
the herd than at the present moment, 
when they had forgotten all things 
except the battling monsters in the 
center of the ring. 
The two bulls were quite evenly 
matched. The patriarch knew more 
of fighting, had learned more wiles, 
but he had neither the strength nor 
the agility of Muztagh. The late 
twilight deepened into the intense 
dark, and the stars of midnight rose 
above the eastern hills. 
All at once Muztagh went to his 
knees, But as might a tiger, he The 50

sprang aside in time to avoid a terrible 
tusk blow to his shoulder. And his 
counter-blow, a lashing cut with the 
head, shattered the great leader to the 
earth. The elephants bounded for- 
ward, but the old leader had a trick 
left in his’ trunk. As Muztagh bore 
down upon him he reared up beneath, 
and almost turned the tables. Only 
the youngster’s superior strength saved 
him from immediate defeat. 
_ But as the night drew to morning, 
the bulls began to see that the tide of 
the battle had turned. Youth was 
conquering—too mighty and agile to 
resist. The rushes of the patriarch 
were ever weaker. He still could in- 
flict punishment, and the hides of 
both of them were terrible to see, but 
he was no longer able to take advan- 
tage of his openings. Then Muztagh 
did a thing that reassured the old 
bulls as to his craft and wisdom. 
Just as a pugilist will invite a blow 
to draw his opponent within range, 
Muztagh pretended to leave his great 
shoulder exposed. The old bull failed 
to see the plot. He bore down, and 
Muztagh was ready with flashing 
tusk. 
What happened thereafter occurred 
too quickly for the eyes of the ele- 
phants to follow. They saw the great THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
VIL 
The keddah was built at last. It 5 
was a strong stockade, opening with 
great wings spreading out one hundred 
yards, and equipped with the great 
gate that lowered like a portcullis at 
the funnel end of the wings. The 
herd had been surrounded by the 
drivers and beaters, and slowly they 
had been driven, for long days, toward 
the keddah mouth. They had guns 
loaded with blank cartridges, and ¢ 
firebrands ready to light. At a given 
signal they would close down quickly 
about the herd, and stampede it into 
the yawning mouth of the stockade. 
No detail had been overlooked. 
No expense had been spared. "The 
profit was assured in advance, not 
only from the matchless Muztagh, but 
from the herd as well. The king of 
the jungle, free now as the winds or ; 
the waters, was about to go back to 
his chains. These had been such 
days! He had led the herd through 
the hills, and had known the rapture 
of living as never before. It had been 
his work to clear the trail of all 
dangers for the herd. It was his 
pride to find them the coolest watering- 
places, the greenest hills. One night

The great leader, seriously hurt, 
backed away into the shadowed jungle. 
His trunk was lowered in token of 
defeat. 
Then the ring was empty except for 
a great red-eyed elephant, whose hide 
was no longer white, standing blaring 
triumph to the stars. 
Three times the elephant salute Muztagh lifted his trunk high and 
charged down with great, driving

slowly he began to overcome the doubt 
that the great bulls had of him—doubt . 
of his youth and experience. If he 
had had three months more. of leader- 
ship, their trust would have been 
absolute. But in the meantime, the 
slow herding toward the keddah had 
gun. 
“We will need brave men to stand 
at the end of the wings of the kedd. 
said Ahmad Din. He spoke no less 
than truth. The man who stands at 
the end of the wings, or wide-stretching 
gates, of the keddah is of course in the 
greatest danger of being charged and 
killed. The herd, mad with fright, 
is only slightly less afraid of the 
spreading wings of the stockade than 
of the yelling, whooping beaters be- 
hind. Often they will try to break 
through the circle rather than enter 
the wings. 
“For two rupees: additional I will 
hold one of the wings,” replied old 
Langur Dass. * Ahmad Din glanced 
at him—at his hard, bright eyes and 
determined face. Then he peered 
hard, and tried in vain to read the 
thoughts behind the eyes. “You are 
a madman, Langur Dass,” he said 
wonderingly. “But thou shalt lie 
behind the right-wing men to pass 
them torches. I have spoken.” 
“And the two extra rupees?” Langur 
asked cunningly. 
a nave 7? One does not throw 
rupees in Upper Burma. 
Within the hour the signal of 
“Mail, mail!” (Go on, go on!) was 
given, and the final laps of the drive 
began. 
The hills grew full of sound. The 
beaters sprang up with firebrand and 
rifle, and closed swiftly about the 
herd. The animals moved slowly at 
first. The time was not quite ripe to 
throw them into a panic. Many times 
the herd would leave their trail and 
start to dip into a valley ora. creek- bed, but always there was a new 
crowd of beaters to block their path. 
But presently the beaters closed in 
on them. Then the animals began 
a wild descent squarely: toward the 
mouth of the keddah. 
“Hai!” the wild men cried. “Oh, 
you forest pigs! On, on! Block the 
way through that valley, you brainless 
sons of jackals! Are you afraid? Ai! 
Stand close! Watch, Puran! Guard 
your post, Khusru! Now on, on— 
do not let them halt! Arre! <Aihai!’’ 
Firebrands waved, rifles cracked, 
the wild shout of beaters increased in 
volume. The men closed in, driving 
the beasts before them. 
But there was one man that did not 
raise his voice. Through all the 
turmoil and pandemonium he crouched 
at the end of the stockade wing, tense 
and silent and alone. To one that 
could have looked into his eyes, it 
would have seemed that his thoughts 
were far and far away. It was just 
old Langur Dass, named for a monkey 
and despised of men. 
He was waiting for the instant that 
the herd would come thundering down 
the hill, in order to pass lighted fire- 
brands to the bold men who held that 
corner. He was not certain that he 
could do the thing he had set out to 
do. Perhaps the herd would sweep 
past him, through the gates. If he 
did win, he would have to face alone 
the screaming, infuriated hill men, 
whose knives were always ready to. 
draw. But knives did not matter 
now. Langur Dass had only his own 
faith and his own creed, and no fear 
could make him betray them. 
Muztagh had lost control of his 
herd. At their head ran the old 
leader that he had worsted. In their 
hour of fear they had turned back to 
him. What did this youngster know 
of elephant-drives? Ever the waving

lessened their circle, the avenues of 
escape became more narrow. The 
yawning arms of the stockade 
stretched just beyond. 
“Will I win, jungle gods?” a little 
gray man at the keddak wing was 
whispering to the forests. “Will I 
save you, great one that I knew in 
babyhood? Will you go down into 
chains before the night is done? Ai! 
I hear the thunder of your feet! The 
moment is almost here. And now— 
your last chance, Maztagh!’”” 
“Close down, close down!’ Ahmad 
Din was shouting to his beaters. 
“The thing is done in another moment. 
Hasten, pigs of the hills! Raise your 
voice! Now! Aihat!” 
The herd was at the very wings of 
the stockade. They had halted an 
instant, milling, and the beaters in- 
creased their shouts. Only one of all 
the herd seemed to know the danger— 
Muztagh himself, and he had dropped 
from the front rank to the very rear. 
He stood with uplifted trunk, facing 
the approaching rows of beaters. 
And there seemed to be no break in 
the whole line. 
The herd started to move on, into 
the wings of captivity; and they did 
not heed his warning squeals to turn. 
The circle of fire drew nearer. Then 
his trunk seemed to droop, and he 
turned, too. He could not break the 
line: He turned, too, toward the 
mouth of the keddah. 
But even as he turned, a brown 
figure darted toward him from the end 
of the wing. A voice known long ago 
was calling to him—a voice that pene- 
trated high and clear above the babble 
of the beaters. “Muztagh!” it was 
crying, “Muztagh!” But it was not the words that 
turned Muztagh. An elephant cannot 
understand words, except a few ele- 
mental sounds such as a horse or dog 
can learn. Rather it was the smell “THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
of the man, remembered from long » 
ago, and the sound of his voice, never 
quite forgotten. For an elephant 
never forgets. 
“Muztagh! Muztagh!’ 
The elephant knew him now. He 
remembered his one friend among all 
the human beings that he knew in 
his calfhood; the one mortal from 
whom he had received love and given 
love in exchange. & 
“More firebrands!” yelled the men 
who held that corner of the wing. 
“Firebrands! Where is Langur Dass?” 
But instead of firebrands that would 
have frightened beast and aided men, 
Langur Dass stepped out from behind 
a tree and beat at the heads of the 
right-wing guards with a bamboo cane 
that whistled and whacked and scat- 
tered them into panic—yelling all 7 
the while—“Muztagh! O my Muz- 
tagh! Here is an opening! Muztagh, 
come!” 
And Muztagh did come—trumpet- 
ing—crashing like an avalanche, with 
Langur Dass hard after him, afraid, 
now that he had done the trick. And 
hot on the trail of Langur Dass ran 
Ahmad Din, with his knife drawn, 
not meaning to let that prize be lost # 
to him at less than the cost of the 
trickster’s life. 
But it was not written that the 
knife should ever enter the flesh of 
Langur Dass. The elephant never 
forgets, and Muztagh was monarch 
of his breed. He turned back -two 
paces, and struck with his trunk. Ah- 
mad Din was knocked aside as the 
wind whips straw. 
For an instant elephant and man 
stood front to front. To the left of 
them the gates of the stockade 
dropped shut behind the herd. ‘The 
elephant stood with trunk slightly 
lifted, for the moment motionless. 
The long-haired man who had saved 
him stood lifting upstretched arms.

    THE ELEPHANT REMEMBERS 
It was such a scene as one might 
remember in an old legend, wherein 
beasts and men were brothers, or such 
as sometimes might steal, like some- 
thing remembered from another age, 
into a man’s dreams. Nowhere but 
in India, where men have a little 
knowledge of the mystery of the ele- 
phant, could it have taken place at all. 
For Langur Dass was speaking to 
my lord the elephant: 
“Take me with thee, Muztagh! 
Monarch of the hills! Thou and I 
are not of the world of men, but of 
the jungle and the rain, the silence, 
and the cold touch of rivers. We are 
brothers, Muztagh. O beloved, wilt 
thou leave me here to die!” 
The elephant slowly turned his 
head and looked scornfully at the 
group of beaters bearing down on 49 
Langur Dass, murder shining no less 
from their knives than from their 
lighted eyes. | 
“Take me,” the old man pleaded; 
“thy herd is gone.” 
The elephant seemed to know what 
he was asking. He had lifted him 
to his great shoulders many times, in 
the last days of his captivity. And 
besides, his old love for Langur Dass 
had never been forgotten. It all 
returned, full and strong as ever. 
For an elephant never can forget. 
It was not one of the man-herd that 
stood pleading before him. It was one 
of his own jungle people, just as, deep 
in his heart, he had always known. 
So with one motion light as air, he 
swung him gently to his shoulder. 
The jungle, vast and mysterious and 
still, closed its gates behind them.

50 THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER 
-O. Henry 
Pitcher, confidential clerk in the 
office of Harvey Maxwell, broker, 
allowed a look of mild interest and 
surprise to visit his usually expression- 
less countenance when his employer 
briskly entered at half past nine in 
company with his young. lady stenog- 
rapher. With a snappy “Good morn- 
ing, Pitcher,’ Maxwell dashed at his 
10 desk as though he were intending to 
leap over it, and then plunged into 
the great. heap of letters and telegrams 
waiting there for him. 
The young lady had been Maxwell’s 
stenographer for a year. She was 
beautiful in a way that was decidedly 
unstenographic. She forewent the 
pomp of the alluring pompadour. She 
wore no chains, bracelets, or lockets. 
20 She had not the air of being about to 
accept an invitation to luncheon. 
Her dress was gray and plain, but it 
fitted her figure with fidelity and 
discretion. In her neat black turban 
hat was the gold-green wing of a 
macaw. On this morning she was 
softly and shyly radiant. Her eyes 
were dreamily bright, her cheeks 
genuine peachblow, her expression a 
30 happy. one, tinged with reminiscence. 
Pitcher, still mildly curious, no- 
ticed a difference in her ways this 
morning. Instead of going straight 
into the adjoining room, where her 
desk was, she lingered, slightly ir- 
resolute, in the outer office. Once she 
moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near 
enough for him to be aware of her 
presence. 
40 The machine sitting at that desk 
was no longer a man; it was a busy 
New York broker, moved by buzzing 
wheels and uncoiling springs. “Well—what is it? Anything?” 
asked Maxwell sharply. His opened 
mail lay like a bank of stage snow on 
his crowded desk. His keen gray eye, 
impersonal and brusque, flashed upon 
her half impatiently. 
“Nothing,” answered the stenog- 
rapher, moving away with a little 
smile. 
“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the con- 
fidential clerk, “did Mr. Maxwell say 
anything yesterday about engaging 
another stenographer?” 
“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He 
told me to get another one. I notified 
the agency yesterday afternoon to 
send over a few samples this morning. 
It’s 9:45 o’clock, and not a single 
picture hat or piece of pineapple 
chewing gum has showed up yet.” 
“I will do the work as usual, then,’? 
said the young lady, “until someone 
comes to fill the place.” And she 
went to her desk at once and hung 
the black turban hat with the gold- 
green macaw wing. in its accustomed. 
place. 
He who has been denied the spec- 
tacle of a busy Manhattan broker 
during a rush of business is handi- 
capped for the profession of anthro- 
‘pology. The poet sings of the “crowded. 
hour of glorious life.” The broker’s 
hour is not only crowded, but the 
minutes and seconds are hanging to 
all the straps and packing both front 
and rear platforms. 
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s 
busy day. The ticker began to reel 
out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the 
desk telephone had a chronic attack 
of buzzing. Men began to throng into 
‘the office and call at him over the

) railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, 
excitedly. Messenger boys ran in and 
out with messages and telegrams. The 
clerks in the office jumped about like 
sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s 
face relaxed into something resembling 
animation. 
On the Exchange there were hurri- 
canes and landslides and snowstorms 
19 and glaciers and volcanoes, and those 
elemental disturbances were repro- 
duced in miniature in the broker’s 
offices. Maxwell shoved his chair 
against the wall and transacted busi- 
ness after the manner of a toe dancer. 
He jumped from ticker to phone, from 
desk to door, with the trained agility 
of a harlequin. 
20 important stress the broker became 
aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden 
hair under a nodding canopy of velvet 
and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin 
sack, and a string of beads as large as 
hickory nuts, ending near the floor 
with a silver heart. There was a self- 
possessed young lady connected with 
these accessories; and Pitcher was 
there to construe her.

Agency to see about the position,”

“Position of stenographer,” said 
Pitcher. “You told me. yesterday

“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” 
said Maxwell. “Why should I have 
given you any such _ instructions?

Pitcher, and don’t bring any more of

The silver heart left the office, 
swinging and banging itself inde- 
pendently against the office furniture 
as it indignantly departed. Pitcher 
seized a moment to remark to the 
bookkeeper that the “old man” seemed. 
to get more absent-minded and _for- 
getful every day of the world. 
The rush and pace of business 
grew fiercer and faster. On the floor 
they were pounding half a dozen 
stocks in which Maxwell’s customers 
were heavy investors. Orders to buy 
and sell were coming and going as 
swift as the flight of swallows. Some 
of his own holdings were imperiled, 
and the man was working like some 
high-geared, delicate, strong machine 
—strung to full tension, going at full 
speed, accurate, never hesitating, with 
the proper word and decision and act 
ready and prompt as_ clockwork. 
Stocks and bonds, loans and mort- 
gages, margins and securities—here 
was a world of finance, and there was 
no room in it for the human world 
or the world of Nature. 
When the luncheon hour drew near 
there came a slight lull in the uproar. 
Maxwell stood by his desk with his 
hands full of telegrams and memo- 
randa, with a fountain pen over his 
right ear and his hair hanging in 
disorderly strings over his forehead. 
His window was open, for the beloved 
janitress Spring had turned on a little 
warmth through the waking registers 
of the earth. 
And through the window came a 
wandering—perhaps a lost—odor—a 
delicate, sweet odor of lilac that fixed 
the broker for a moment immovable. 
For this odor belonged to Miss Leslie; 
it was her own, and hers only. 
The odor brought her vividly, al- 
most tangibly, before him. The world 70

of finance dwindled suddenly to a 
speck. And she was in the next room 
—twenty steps away. 
“By George, I’ll do it now,” said 
Maxwell, half aloud. “I'll ask her 
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long 
ago.” 
He dashed into the inner office 
with the haste of a short trying to 
io cover. He charged upon the desk 
of the stenographer. 
She looked at him with a smile. 
A soft pink crept over her cheek, and 
her eyes were kind and frank. Max- 
well leaned one elbow on her desk. 
He still clutched fluttering papers 
with both hands, and the pen was " 
above his ear. 
. “Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, 
20 “I have but a moment to spare. I 
want to say something in that mo- 
ment. Will you be my wife? I 
haven’t had time to make love to you 
in the ordinary way, but I really do 
love you. Talk quick, -please—those 
fellows are clubbing the stuffing out 
of Union Pacific.” “Oh, what are you talking about?” 
exclaimed the young lady. She rose 
to her feet and gazed upon him, 3 
round-eyed. 
“Don’t you understand?” said Max- 
well, restively. “I want you to marry 
me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted 
to tell you, and I snatched a minute 
when things had slackened up a bit. 
They’re calling me for the phone now. 
Tell ’em to wait a minute, Pitcher. 
Won’t you, Miss Leslie?” 
The stenographer acted very queer-~ 40 
ly. At first she seemed overcome 
with amazement; then tears flowed 
from her wondering eyes; and then 
she smiled sunnily through them, and 
one of her arms slid tenderly about 
the broker’s neck. 
“I know now,” she said, softly. 
“It’s this old business that has driven 
everything else out of your head for 
the time. I was frightened at first. 5 
Don’t you remember, Harvey? We 
were married last evening at eight 
o’clock in the Little Church Around

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1, William Sydney Porter, better known 
under his pen-name of O. Henry, is probably 
the most famous of recent writers of the short 
story in America. His stories first appeared 
in magazines and newspapers, and have been 
collected in twelve volumes. Their interest 
is due to the brevity with. which he achieves 
his effects, their mixture of the realism and 
the romance of ordinary American life, their 
humor and pathos, and the unfailing sympathy 
which they. extend to all sorts of people. 
O. Henry writes as men talk; there is nothing 
“bookish” or literary about his work, despite 
the fact that at one period he studied the 
unabridged dictionary. so’ faithfully that he 
knew much of it by heart. 
g. This story, from The Four Milion, illus- 
trates the method used by a true master. There 
are no unnecessary details. Every sentence 
-adds to the ‘swift movement of the plot and to the surprising conclusion. The characters 
are clearly drawn. The broker’s office is as 
real as though you were actually looking at 
what was going on. The language is adapted 
to the situation; it belongs to a story about a 
busy broker, not to a story about one of King 
Arthur’s knights or to Irving’s story of the 
Specter Bridegroom. Thus plot, character, 
setting, and language all contribute to the 
single impression that a good short story should 
always give. 
QUESTIONS AND Torics 
1. In Junior High School Literature, Book 
Two, it was pointed out that the short story 
has no unnecessary characters, incidents, or 
details. Everything aids in swift movement 
toward the moment of highest interest. Give 
illustrations of these points drawn from this 
story. 
2.- The main divisions of the typical short 
story are the introduction, the main incident,  
-P-A-G-E-62

the point of highest interest, or climax, and the 
conclusion. Point out each of these divisions 
in this story. Why is the introduction effective? 
8. Point out details that characterize 
vividly each person in the story. Which person ° 
does not speak but is nevertheless clearly 
described? 
4. Study the conclusion. Was it what you 
expected? What other conclusion was possible? 53 
The endings of O. Henry’s stories have been 
compared to the old game of ‘‘snap-the-whip.”” 
Is the comparison a good one here?

All in the Wrong. 
Many years ago I contracted an 
intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand. 
He was of an ancient Huguenot fam- 
ily, and had once been wealthy; but 
a series of misfortunes had reduced 
him to want. To avoid the mortifi- 
cation consequent upon his disasters, 
he left New Orleans, the city of his 
forefathers, and took up his residence 
at Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, 
South Carolina. 
This island is a very singular one. 
It consists of little else than the sea 
sand, and is about three miles long. 
Its breadth at no point exceeds a 
quarter of a mile. It is separated 
from the mainland by a scarcely per- 
ceptible creek, oozing its way through 
a wilderness of reeds and slime, a 
favorite resort of the marsh-hen. 
The vegetation, as might be sup- 
posed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. 
No trees of any magnitude are to be 
seen. Near the western extremity, 
where Fort Moultrie stands, and 
where are some miserable frame build- 
ings, tenanted during summer by the 
8, Huguenot, one of the French Protestants of the 16th and 17th centuries. Under persecution many Hugue- nots emigrated to America. fugitives from Charleston dust and 
fever, may be found, indeed, the 
bristly palmetto; but the whole is- 
land, with the exception of this 
western point, and a line of hard white 
beach on the seacoast, is covered with 
a dense undergrowth of the sweet 
myrtle, so much prized by the horti- 
culturists of England. The shrub here 
often attains the height of fifteen or 
‘twenty feet, and forms an almost 
impenetrable coppice, burdening the 
air with its fragrance. 
In the utmost recesses. of this 
coppice, not far from the eastern or 
more remote end of the island, 
Legrand had built himself a small 
hut, which he occupied when I first, by 
mere accident, made his acquaintance. 
This soon ripened into friendship—for 
there was much in the recluse to 
excite interest and esteem. I found 
him well educated, with unusual 
powers of mind, but infected with 
misanthropy, and subject to perverse 
moods of alternate enthusiasm and 
melancholy. He had with him many 
books, but rarely employed them. 
His chief amusements were gunning 
and fishing, or sauntering along the 
beach and through the’ myrtles in 
quest of shells or entomological speci- 
mens—his collection of the latter 40

might have been envied by a, Swam- 
merdamm. In these excursions he 
was usually accompanied by an old 
negro called Jupiter, who had been 
manumitted before the reverses of 
the family, but who could be induced, 
neither by threats nor by promises, 
to abandon what he considered his 
right of attendance upon the footsteps 
to of his young “Massa Will.” It is not 
improbable that the relatives of Le- 
grand, conceiving him to be somewhat 
"unsettled in intellect, had contrived 
to instill this obstinacy into Jupiter, 
with a view to the supervision and 
guardianship of the wanderer. 
The winters in the latitude of 
Sullivan’s Island are seldom very 
severe, and in the fall of the year it 
20 is a rare event indeed when a fire is 
considered necessary. About the mid- 
dle of October, 18—, there occurred, 
however, a day of remarkable chilli- 
ness. Just before sunset I scrambled 
my way through the evergreens to 
the hut of my friend, whom I had not 
visited for several weeks—my resi- 
dence being at that time in Charleston, 
a distance of nine miles from the 
30 island, while the facilities of passage 
and repassage were very far behind 
those of the present day. Upon 
reaching the hut I rapped, as was my 
custom, and, getting no reply, sought 
for the key where I knew it was 
secreted, unlocked the door, and went 
in. A fine fire was blazing upon the 
hearth. It was a novelty, and by no 
means an ungrateful one. I threw 
40 off an overcoat, took an armchair by 
the crackling logs, and awaited pa- 
tiently the arrival of my hosts. 
Soon after dark they arrived, and 
gave me a most cordial welcome. 
Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, 
bustled about to prepare some marsh- 
hens for supper. Legrand was in one

—of enthusiasm. He had found an 
unknown bivalve, forming a new. 
genus, and, more than this, he had 
hunted down and secured, with Ju- 
piter’s assistance, a scarabeus which 
-he believed to be totally new, but in 
respect to which he wished to have 
my opinion on the morrow. 
“And why not tonight?” I asked, 
rubbing my hands over the blaze, 
and wishing the whole tribe of seara- 
bei at the devil. 
“Ah, if I had only known you were 
here!” said Legrand; “but it’s so 
long since I saw you; and how could 
I foresee that you would pay me a 
visit this very night, of all others? 
As I was coming home I met Lieu- 
tenant G—, from the fort, and, very 
foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it 
will be impossible for you to see it 
until the morning. Stay here  to- 
night, and I will send Jup dowr *-  ~

in creation!”

it seemed to me, than the case q| 
manded, “is that any reason for yo

here he turned to me—“‘is really

but of this you cannot judge till to- 
morrow. In the meantime I can give 
you some idea of the shape.” Saying 
this, he seated himself at a small 
table, on which were a pen and ink, 
but no paper. He looked for some 
in a drawer, but found none. 
“Never mind,” said he at length, 
“this will answer’; and he drew from 
his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what 
I took to be very dirty foolscap, and 
made upon it a rough drawing with the 
pen. While he did this, I retained my 
seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. 
When the design was complete, he 
handed it to me without rising. As 
I received it, a low growl was heard, 
succeeded by a scratching at the door. 
Jupiter opened it, and a large New- 
foundland, belonging to Legrand, 
rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, 
and loaded me with caresses; for I 
had shown him much attention during 
previous visits. When his gambols 
were over, I looked at the paper, and, 
to speak the truth, found myself not 
a little puzzled at what my friend 
had depicted. 
“Well!” I said, after contemplating 
it for some minutes, “this is a strange 
scarabseus, I must confess; new to me; 
never: saw anything like it before— 
unless it was a skull, or a death’s-head, 
which it more nearly resembles than 
anything else that has come under 
my observation.” 
“A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand 
—“oh—yes—well, it has something of 
that appearance upon paper, no doubt. 
The two ‘upper black spots look like 
eyes, eh? and the longer one at the 
bottom like a mouth—and then the 
shape of the whole is oval.” 
“Perhaps so,” said I; “‘but,. Le- 
grand, I fear you are no artist. I 
must wait until I see the beetle itself, 
if I am to form any ‘idea of its per- 
sonal appearance.” 
“Well, I don’t know,” said he, a 
  55 
little nettled, “I draw tolerably— 
should do it at least—have had good 
masters, and flatter myself that I am 
not quite a blockhead.” 
“But, my dear fellow, you are 
joking then,” said I; “this is a very 
passable skull—indeed, I may say 
that it is a very. ezcellent skull, ac- 
cording to the vulgar notions about 
such specimens of physiology—and 
your scarabeus must be the queerest 
scarabeus in the world if it resembles 
it. Why, we may get up a very 
thrilling bit of superstition upon this 
hint. I presume you will call the bug 
Scarabeus Caput Hominis, or some- 
thing of that kind—there are many 
similar titles in the Natural Histories. 
But where are the antenns: you spoke 
of?” 
“The antenne!” said Legrand, who 
seemed to be getting unaccountably 
warm upon the subject; “I am sure 
you must see the antenne. I made 
them as distinct as they are in the 
original insect, and I presume that is 
sufficient.” 
“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you 
have—still I don’t see them”; and I 
handed him the paper without addi- 
tional remark, not wishing to ruffle his 
temper; but I was much surprised at 
the turn affairs had taken; his ill 
humor puzzled me—and as for the 
drawing of the beetle, there were 
positively no antenne visible, and the 
whole did bear a very close resemblance 
to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head. 
He received the paper very 
peevishly, and was about to crumple 
it, apparently to throw it in the fire, 
when a casual glance at the design 
seemed suddenly to rivet his atten- 
tion. In an instant his face grew 
violently red—in another as exces- 
sively pale. For some minutes he 
continued to scrutinize the drawing

minutely where he sat. At length he 
arose, took a candle from the table, 
and proceeded to seat himself upon 
a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the 
room. ‘Here again he made an anxious 
examination of the paper, turning it in 
all directions. He said nothing, how- 
ever, and his conduct greatly aston- 
ished me; yet I thought it prudent not 
to exacerbate the growing moodiness 
of his temper by any comment. 
Presently he took from his coat pocket 
a wallet, placed the paper carefully in 
it, and deposited both in a writing- 
desk, which he locked. He now 
grew more composed in his demeanor; 
but his original air of enthusiasm had 
quite disappeared. Yet he seemed 
not so much sulky as abstracted. As 
the evening wore away he became 
more and more absorbed in reverie, 
from which no sallies of mine could 
arouse him. It had been my inten- 
tion to pass the night at the hut, as 
I had frequently done before, but, 
seeing my host in this mood, I deemed 
it proper to take leave. He did not 
press me to remain, but, as I departed, 
he shook my hand with even more 
than his usual cordiality. 
It was about a month after this 
(and during the interval I had seen 
nothing of Legrand) when I received 
a visit, at Charleston, from his man, 
Jupiter. I had never seen the good 
old negro look so dispirited, and I 
feared that some serious disaster had 
befallen ‘my friend. 
“Well, Jup,”’ said I, “what is the 
matter now? How is your master?” 
“Why, to speak de troof, massa, 
him not so berry well as mought be.” 
“Not well! I am truly sorry to 
hear it. What does he complain of?” 
“Dar, dat’s it! Him neber plain of

“Very sick, Jupiter! Why didn’t 
you say so at once? Is he confined

“No, dat he ain’t! He ain’t find »

“Jupiter, I should like to under- 
stand what it is you are talking about. 
‘You say your master is sick. Hasn’t 
he told you what ails him?” 
“Why, massa, ’tain’t worf while for

“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”

“Eh?—what? Ah, yes! Upon the

of what has occasioned this illness, 
or rather this change of conduct?

“No, massa, dey ain’t bin noffin on-

“And what cause have you, Jupiter, 
for such a supposition?” 
“Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too.

I rap him up in de paper and stuff

“And you think, then, that your 
master was really bitten by the beetle, 
~ nd that the bite made him sick?” 
“T don’t tink noffin about it—I

“But how do you know he dreams

“How I know? Why, cause he talk 
about it in he sleep—dat’s how I nose.” 
“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; 
30 but to what fortunate circumstances 
am I to attribute the honor of a visit 
from you today?” 
“What de matter, massa?” 
“Did you bring any message from 
Mr. Legrand?” 
“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel”’; 
and here Jupiter handed me a note 
which ran thus: 
My dear ——: Why have I not seen 
I hope you have 
not been so foolish as to take offense at 
any little brusquerie of mine; but no, that 
is improbable. 
Since I saw you I have had great cause 
for anxiety. I have something to tell you, 
yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether 
I should tell it at all. 
T have not been quite well for some days 
past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost 
42. brusquerie, rudeness, 57 
beyond endurance, by his well-meant 
attentions. Would you believe it—he had 
prepared a huge stick, the other day, with 
which to chastise me for giving him the 
slip, and spending the day, solus, among 
the hills on the mainland. I verily believe 
that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging. 
I have made no addition to my cabinet 
since we met. If you can, in any way, 
make it vonvenient, come over with Jupi- 
ter. Docome. I wish to see you tonight, 
upon business of importance. I assure you 
that it is of the highest importance. 
Ever yours, 
William Legrand 
There was something in the tone 
of this note which gave me great 
uneasiness, Its whole style differed 
materially from that of Legrand. 
What could he be dreaming of? What 
new crotchet possessed his excitable 
brain? What “business of the highest 
importance” could he possibly have to 
transact? Jupiter’s account of him 
boded no good. I dreaded lest the 
continued pressure of misfortune had, 
at length, fairly unsettled the reason 
of my friend. Without a moment’s 
hesitation, therefore, I prepared to 
accompany the negro. 
Upon reaching the wharf, I no- 50 
ticed a scythe and three spades, all — 
apparently new, lying in the bottom 
of the boat in which we were to 
embark. 
“What is the meaning of all this, 
Jup?” I inquired. 
“Him syfe, massa, and spade.” 
“Very true; but what are they 
doing here?” 
“Him de syfe and de spade what 
Massa Will sis pon my buying for him 
in de town, and de debbil’s own lot 
of money I had to gib for em.” 
“But what, in the name of all that 
is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’ 
going to do with scythes and spades?” 
“Dat’s more dan I know, and debbil 
take me if I don’t believe ’tis more 
dan he know, too. But it’s all cum ob 
de bug.” 100

Finding that no satisfaction was to 
be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole 
intellect seemed to be absorbed by 
“de bug,)’ I now stepped into the 
boat and made sail. With a fair 
and strong breeze we soon ran into 
the little cove to the northward of 
Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some 
two miles brought us to the hut. It 
was about three in the afternoon when 
we arrived. Legrand had been await- 
ing us in eager expectation. He 
grasped my hand with a nervous em- 
pressement, which alarmed me and 
strengthened the suspicions already 
entertained. His countenance was 
pale ‘even to ghastliness, and his deep- 
set eyes glared with unnatural luster. 
After some inquiries respecting his © 
health, I asked him, not knowing 
what better to say, if he had yet 
obtained the scarabeus from Lieu- 
tenant G—. 
“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring 
violently, “I got it from him the next 
morning. Nothing should tempt me 
to part with that scarabeus. Do 
you know that Jupiter is quite right 
about it?” - 
“In what way?” I asked, with a 
sad foreboding at heart. 
“In supposing it to be a bug of 
‘real gold.” He said this with an air 
of profound seriousness, and I felt 
inexpressibly shocked. 
“This bug is to make my fortune,” 
he continued, with a triumphant 
smile, “to reinstate me in my family 
possessions. Is it any wonder, then, 
that I prize it? Since Fortune has 
thought fit to bestow it upon me, 
I have only to use it properly and I 
shall arrive at the gold of which it is - 
the index. Jupiter, bring me that 
scarabeeus!”” - 
“What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder 
not go fer trubble dat bug—you mus 
git him for your own self.” Here- 
upon Legrand arose, with a grave and THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
stately air, and brought me the beetle 50 
from a glass case in which it was 
enclosed. It was a beautiful scara- 
beeus, and, at that time, unknown to 
naturalists—of course a great prize 
in a scientific point of view. There 
were two round, black spots near one 
extremity of the back, and a long one 
near the other. The scales. were 
exceedingly hard and glossy, with all 
the appearance of burnished gold. « 
The weight of the insect was very 
remarkable, and, taking all things 
into consideration, I could hardly 
blame Jupiter for his opinion respect- 
ing it; but what to make of Legrand’s 
agreement with that opinion, I could 
not, for the life of me, tell. 
“I sent’ for you,” said he, in a 
grandiloquent tone, when I had com- 
pleted my examination of the beetle, 7 
“I sent for you that I might have 
your counsel and assistance in further- 
ing the views of Fate and of the bug—”’ 
“My dear Legrand,” I cried, inter- 
rupting him, “you are certainly un- 
well, ‘and had better use some little 
precautions. You shall go to bed, 
and [I will remain with you a few 
days, until you get over this. You 
are feverish and—” 
“Feel my pulse,” said he. 
I felt it, and, to say the truth, 
found not the slightest indication of 
fever. 
“But you may be ill, and yet have 
no fever. Allow me this once to 
prescribe for you. In the first place, 
go to bed. In the next—” 
“You are mistaken,” he interposed; 
“T am as well as I can expect to be 
under the excitement which I suffer. 
If you really wish me well, you will 
relieve this excitement.” 
‘And how is this to be done?” 
“Very easily. Jupiter and myself 
‘are going upon.an expedition into the 
hills, upon the mainland, and, in this 
expedition, we shall need the aid of

some person in whom we can confide. 
You are the only one we can trust. 
Whether. we succeed or fail, the ex- 
citement which you now perceive in 
me will be equally allayed.” 
“T am anxious to oblige you in any 
way,” I replied; “but do you mean 
to say that this, infernal beetle has 
any connection with your expedition 
into the hills?” 
“It has.” . 
“Then, Legrand, I can. become a 
party to no such absurd proceeding.” 
“I am sorry—very sorry—for we 
shall have to try it by ourselves.” 
“Try it by yourselves! The man 
is surely mad! But stay—how long 
do you propose to be absent?” 
“Probably all night. We shall start 
immediately, and be back, at all 
events, by sunrise.” 
“And will you promise me, upon 
your honor, that when this freak of 
yours is over and the bug business 
(good God!) settled to your satis- 
faction, you will then return home 
and follow my advice implicitly, as 
that of your physician?” 
“Yes, I promise; and now let us be 
off, for we have no time to lose.’’ 
‘With a heavy heart I accompanied 
my friend. We started about four 
o’clock—-Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, 
and myself. Jupiter had: with him 
the scythe and spades—the whole of 
which he insisted upon carrying, more 
through fear, it seemed to me, of 
trusting either of the implements 
within reach of his master, than from 
any excess of industry or complaisance. 
His demeanor was dogged in the ex- 
treme, and “dat d—d bug” were the 
sole words which escaped his lips 
during the journey. For my own part, 
I had charge of a couple of dark lan- 
terns, while Legrand contented him- 
self with the scarabzeus, which he 
carried attached to the end of a bit of 
whipcord, twirling it to and fro, with 59 
the air of. a conjuror, as he went. 
When I observed this last, plain 
evidence of my friend’s aberration of 
mind, I could scarcely refrain from 
tears. I thought it best, however, 
to humor his fancy, at least for the 
present, or until I could adopt some 
more energetic measures with a chance 
of success. In the meantime I en- 50 
deavored, but all in vain, to sound © 
him in regard to the object of the 
expedition. Having succeeded in in- 
ducing me to accompany him, he 
seemed unwilling to hold conversation 
upon any topic of minor importance, 
and to all my questions vouchsafed 
no other reply than, “We shall see!”’ 
We crossed the creek at the head 
of the island by means of a skiff, and, 
ascending the high grounds on the 
shore of the mainland, proceeded in 
a northwesterly direction through a 
tract of country excessively wild and 
desolate, where no trace of a human 
footstep was to .be seen. Legrand 
led the way with decision, pausing 
only for an instant, here and there, 
to consult what appeared to be certain 
landmarks of his own contrivance 
upon a former occasion. 
In this manner we journeyed for 70 
about two hours; and the sun was . 
just setting when we entered a, region 
infinitely more dreary than any yet 
seen. It was a species of table-land, 
near the summit of an almost inac- 
cessible hill, densely wooded ftom 
base to -pinnacle, and interspersed 
with huge crags that appeared to lie 
loosely upon the soil, and in many 
cases were prevented from precipitat- 
ing themselves into the valleys below - 
merely by the support of the trees 
against which they reclined. Deep ra- 
vines, in various directions, gave an 
air of still sternersolemnity tothe scene. 
The natural platform to which we 
had clambered was thickly over- 
grown with brambles, through which
-P-A-G-E-69
- 60 
10 
30 we soon discovered that it would have 
been impossible to force our way but 
for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direc- 
tion of his master, proceeded to clear 
for'us a path to the foot of an im- 
mensely large tulip tree, which stood, 
with some eight or ten oaks, upon the 
level, and far surpassed them all, and 
all other trees which I had then ever 
seen, in the beauty of its foliage and 
form, in the wide spread of its 
branches, and in the general majesty 
of its appearance. When we reached 
this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter 
and asked him if he thought he could 
climb it. The old man seemed a little 
staggered by the question, and for 
some moments made no reply. At 
length he approached the huge trunk, 
walked slowly around it, and exam- 
ined it with minute attention. When 
he had completed his scrutiny, he 
merely said: 
“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he 
ebber see in he life.” 
“Then up with you as soon as 
possible, for it will soon be too dark 
to see what we are about.” 
“How far mus go up, massa?” in- 
quired Jupiter. 
“Get up the main trunk first, and 
then I will tell you which way to go— 
and here—stop! take this beetle with 
ou.” 
“De bug, Massa Will! De goole 
bug!” cried the negro, drawing back 
in dismay; “what for mus tote de bug 
way up de tree? D—n if I do!” 
“Tf you are afraid, Jup, a great big 
negro like you, to take hold of a 
harmless little dead beetle, why, you 
can carry it up by this string—but, 
if you do not take it up with you in 
some way, I shall be under the neces- 
sity of breaking your head with this 
shovel.” 
“What de matter now, massa?” 
said Jup, evidently shamed into com- 
pliance; “always want fur to ‘raise THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
fuss wid old nigger. Was only fun- 
nin, anyhow. Me feered de bug! 
What I keer for de bug?” Here he 
took cautiously hold of the extreme 
end of the string, and, maintaining 
the insect as far from his person as 
circumstances would permit, prepared 
to ascend the tree. ' 
In youth, the tulip tree, or Lirioden- 
dron Tulipifera, the most magnificent 
of American foresters, has a trunk 
peculiarly smooth, and often rises to 
a great height without lateral 
branches; but in its riper age the 
bark becomes gnarled and uneven, 
while many short limbs make their 
appearance on the stem. Thus the 
difficulty of ascension, in the present 
case, lay more in semblance. than in 
reality. Embracing the huge cylin; 
der, as closely as possible, with his 
arms and knees, seizing with his 
hands some projections, and resting 
his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, 
after one or two narrow esca| 
falling, at length wriggled 
into the first great fork, ancl 8 
to consider the whole business as 
virtually accomplished. The risk of 
the achievement was, in fact, now 
over, although the climber + ~ -

to what I say. Look down the trunk 
and count the limbs below you on 
this side. How many limbs have you 
passed?” 
“One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done 
pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis 
side.” 
“Then go one limb higher.” 
In a few minutes the yoice was 
heard again, announcing that the 
seventh limb was attained. 
“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evi- 
dently much excited, “I want you to 
work your way out upon that limb 
as far as you can. If you see any- 
thing strange, let me know.” 
By this time what little doubt I 
might have entertained of my poor 
friend’s insanity was put finally at 
rest. I had no alternative but to 
conclude him stricken with lunacy, 
and I became seriously anxious about 
getting him home. While I was 
pondering upon what was best to be 
done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard. 
“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis 
limb berry far—’tis dead limb putty 
much all de way.” 
“Did you say it was a dead limb, 
Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering 
voice. 
“Yes, massa, him dead as de door- 
nail—done up for sartain-——done de- 
parted dis here life.” 
“What in the name of Heaven shall 
T do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in 
the greatest distress. 
“Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity 
to interpose a word, “why, come home 
and go to bed. Come now! That’s 
a fine fellow. It’s getting late, and, 
besides, you remember your promise.” 
“Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding 
me in the least, “do you hear me?” 
“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber 
so plain.” 
“Try the wood well, then, with 
your knife, and see if you think it 
very rotten.” 61 
“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” 
replied the negro in a few moments, 
“but not so berry rotten as mought 
be. Mought ventur out leetle way 
pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.” 
_“By yourself! What do you mean?” 
“Why, I mean de bug. “Tis berry 
hebby bug. Spose I drop him down 
fuss, and den de limb won’t break 
wid just de weight ob one nigger.” 
“You infernal scoundrel!’ cried 
Legrand, apparently much relieved, 
“what do you mean by telling me 
such nonsense as that? As sure as 
you let that beetle fall, Pll break your 
neck. Look here, Jupiter, do you 
hear me?” 
“Yes, massa; needn’t hollo at poor 
nigger dat style.” 
“Well, now listen! If you will 
venture out on the limb as far as 
you think safe, and not let go the 
beetle, I’ make you a present of a 
silver dollar as soon as you get down.” 
“T’m gwine, Massa Will—deed I 
is,” replied the negro very promptly, 
“most out to de eend now.” 
~ “Out to the end!” here fairly screamed. 
Legrand; “do you say you are out to 
the end of that limb?” 
“Soon be to de eend, massa— 
o-0-0-0-oh! Lorgol-a-marcy! what is

“Well!” cried Legrand, highly de- 
lighted, “what is it?” 
“Why, *tain’t nuffin but a skull—

an de crows done gobble ebery bit

“A skull, you say! Very well! how 
is it fastened to the limb? What holds 
it on?” 
“Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why,

“Well, now, Jupiter, do exactly as 
I tell you—do you hear?” _
-P-A-G-E-71

40 “Yes, massa.” 
“Pay attention, then! Find the left 
eye of the skull.” 
“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! Why, dar 
ain’t no eye lef at all.” 
“Curse your stupidity! Do you 
know your right hand from your left?” 
“Yes, I nose dat—nose all bout dat 
—’tis my lef hand what I chops de 
wood wid.” 
“To be sure! you are left-handed; 
and your left eye is on the same side 
as your left hand. Now, I suppose 
you can find the left eye of the skull, 
or the place where the left eye has 
been. Have you found it?” 
Here was a long pause. 
the negro asked, “Is de lef eye of de 
skull pon de same side as de lef hand 
of de skull, too? Cause de skull 
ain’t got not a bit ob a hand at all— - 
nebber mind! TI got de lef eye now— 
here de lef eye! What must do wid 
it?” 
“Let the beetle drop through it, 
as far as the string will reach—but 
be careful and not let go your hold of 
the string.” 
“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty 
easy ting for to put de bug fru de 
hole—look out for him dar below!” 
During this colloquy no portion of 
Jupiter’s person could be seen; but 
the beetle, which he had suffered to 
descend, was now visible at the end 
of the string, and glistened like a 
globe of burnished gold in the last 
rays of the setting sun, some of which 
still faintly illumined the eminence 
upon which we stood. The scarabeus 
hung quite clear of any branches, and, 
if allowed to fall, would have fallen 
at our feet. Legrand immediately 
took the scythe, and cleared with it 
a circular space, three or four yards 
in diameter, just beneath the insect, 
and, having accomplished this, or- 
dered Jupiter to let go the string and 
come down from the tree. At length _

chiming in with favorite preconceived 
ideas; and then I called to mind the 
poor fellow’s speech about the beetle’s 
being the “index of his fortune.’ 
Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and 
puzzled, but at length I concluded 
to make a virtue of necessity—to dig 
with a good will, and thus the sooner 
to convince the visionary, by ocular 
demonstration, of the fallacy of the 
opinions he entertained. 
The lanterns having been lit, we 
all fell to work with a zeal worthy a 
more rational cause; and, as the glare 
fell upon our persons and implements, 
I could not help thinking how pic- 
turesque a group we composed, and 
how strange and suspicious our labors 
must have appeared to any interloper 
who, by chance, might have stumbled 
upon our whereabouts. 
We dug very steadily for two hours. 
Little was said; and our chief em- 
barrassment lay in the yelpings of 
the dog, who took exceeding interest 
in. our proceedings. He, at length, 
became so obstreperous that we grew 
fearful of his giving the alarm to some 
stragglers in the vicinity; or, rather, 
this was the apprehension of Legrand; 
for myself, I should have rejoiced at 
any interruption which might have 
enabled me to get the wanderer home. 
The noise was, at length, very effectu- 
ally silenced by Jupiter, who, getting 
out of the hole with a dogged air of 
deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth 
up with one of his suspenders, and 
then returned, with a grave chuckle, 
to his task. 
When the time mentioned had ex- 
pired, we had reached a depth of five 
feet, and yet no signs of any treasure 
became manifest. A general pause 
ensued, and I began to hope that the 
farce was at an end. Legrand, how- 
ever, although evidently much dis- 
concerted, wiped his brow thought- 
i fully and recommenced. We had ex- 
  63 
cavated the entire circle of four feet 
diameter, and now we slightly en- 
larged the limit, and went to the 
farther depth of two feet. Still 
nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, 
whom I sincerely pitied, at length 
clambered from the pit, with the 
bitterest disappointment imprinted 
upon every feature, and proceeded 
slowly and reluctantly, to put on his 
coat, which he had thrown off’ at the 
beginning of his labor. In the mean- 
time I made no remark. - Jupiter, at a 
signal from his master, began to 
gather up his tools, This done, and 
the dog having been unmuzzled, we 
turned in profound silence toward 
home. 
We had taken, perhaps, a dozen 
steps in this direction, when, with a 
loud oath, Legrand strode up to 
Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. 
The astonished negro opened his eyes 
and mouth to the fullest extent, let 
fall the spades, and fell upon his 
knees. 
“You scoundrel,” said Legrand, 
hissing out the syllables from between 
his clenched teeth, “you infernal 
black villain! Speak, I tell you! An- 
swer me this instant, without pre- 
varication! Which—which is your 
left eye?” 
“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! Ain’t 
dis here my lef eye for sartain?” 
roared the terrified Jupiter, placing 
his hand upon his right organ of 
vision, and holding it there with a 
desperate pertinacity, as if in imme- 
diate dread of his master’s attempt 
at a gouge. 
“I thought so! I knew it! Hur- 
rah!” vociferated Legrand, letting the 
negro go, and executing a series of 
curvets and caracoles, much to the 
astonishment of his valet, who, arising 
from his knees, looked mutely from 
his master to myself, and then from 
myself to his master. 60

” “Come! We must go back,” said 
the latter, “the game’s not up yet”; 
and he again led the way to the tulip 
tree. 
“Jupiter,” said he, when we reached - 
its foot, “come here! Was the skull 
nailed to the limb with the face out- 
ward, or with the face to the limb?” 
‘De face was out, massa, so dat de 
crows could get at de eyes good, 
widout any trouble.” 
“Well, then, was it this eye or 
that through which you dropped the 
beetle?” Here Legrand touched each 
of Jupiter’s eyes. 
“Twas dis eye, Massa—de lef eye— 
jis as you tell me,” and here it was 
his right eye that the negro indicated. 
“That will do—we must try it 
again.” 
Here, my friend, about whose mad- 
ness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, 
certain indications of method, re- 
moved the peg which marked the spot 
where the beetle fell, to a spot about 
three inches to the westward of its 
former position. Taking, now, the 
tape-measure from the nearest point 
of the trunk to the peg, as before, 
and continuing the extension in ‘a 
straight line to the distance of fifty 
feet, a spot was indicated, removed, 
by several yards, from the point at 
which we had been digging. 
Around the new position a circle, 
somewhat larger than in the former 
instance, was now described, and we 
again set to work with the spades. 
I was dreadfully’ weary, but, scarcely 
understanding what had occasioned 
the change in my thoughts, I felt no 
longer any great aversion from the 
labor imposed. I had become most 
unaccountably interested—nay, even 
excited. Perhaps there was some- 
thing, amid all the extravagant de- 
meanor of Legrand—some air of fore- 
thought, or of deliberation—which 
impressed me. I dug eagerly, and THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

THE GOLD BUG 
long, three feet broad, and two and a 
half feet deep. It was firmly secured 
by bands of. wrought iron, riveted, 
and forming a kind of trelliswork over 
the whole. On each side of the 
chest, near the top, were three rings 
of iron—six in all—by means of which 
a firm hold could be obtained by six 
persons. Our utmost united en- 
deavors served only to disturb the 
coffer very slightly in its bed. We 
at once saw the impossibility of re- 
moving so great a weight. Luckily, 
the sole fastenings of the lid con- 
sisted of two sliding bolts. These we 
drew back-—trembling and panting 
with anxiety. In an instant, a treas- 
ure of incalculable value lay gleaming 
before us. As the rays of the lan- 
terns fell within the pit, there flashed 
upward, from a confused heap of gold 
and of jewels, a glow and a glare that 
absolutely dazzled our eyes. 
‘I shall not pretend to describe the 
feelings with which I gazed. Amaze- 
ment was, of course, predominant. 
Legrand appeared exhausted with ex- 
citement, and spoke very few words. 
Jupiter’s countenance wore, for some 
minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is 
possible, in the nature of things, for 
any negro’s visage to assume. He 
seemed  stupefied —thunderstricken. 
Presently he fell upon his knees in 
the pit and, burying his naked arms 
up to the elbows in gold, let them 
there remain, as if enjoying the luxury 
of a bath. At length, with a deep 
sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy: 
“And dis all cum ob de goole bug, 
de putty goole bug, de poor little 
goole bug, what I boosed in dat 
sabage kind ob: style! Ain’t you 
shamed ob yourself, nigger? Answer 
me dat!” 
It became necessary, at last, that 
I should arouse both master and valet 
to the expediency of removing the 
treasure. It was growing late, and 65 
it behooved us to make exertion, that 
we might get everything housed be- 
fore daylight. It was difficult to 
say what should be done, and much 
time was spent in deliberation—so 
confused were the ideas of all. We 
finally lightened the box by removing 
two-thirds of its contents, when we 
were enabled, with some trouble, to 
raise it from the hole. The articles 
taken out were deposited among the 
brambles, and the dog left to guard 
them, with strict orders from Jupiter 
neither, upon any pretense, to stir 
from the spot, nor to open his mouth 
until our return. We then hurriedly 
made for home with the chest, reach- 
ing the hut in safety, but after ex- 
cessive toil, at one o’clock in the 
morning. Worn out as we were, it 
was not in human nature to do more 
just now. We rested until two, and 
had supper; starting for the hills im- 
mediately afterwards, armed with 
three stout sacks, which by good luck 
were upon the premises. A little be- 
fore four we arrived at the pit, divided 
the remainder of the booty, as equally 
as might be, among us, and, leaving 
the holes unfilled, again set out for 
the hut, at which, for the second 
time, we deposited our golden bur- 
dens, just as the first streaks of the 
dawn gleamed from over the treetops 
in the east. ; 
We were now thoroughly broken 
down, but the intense excitement of 
the time denied us repose. After 
an unquiet slumber. of some three or 
four hours’ duration, we arose, as if by 
preconcert, to make examination of 
our treasure. 
The chest had been full to the brim, 
and we spent the whole day, and the 
greater part of the next night, in a 
scrutiny of its contents. There had 
been nothing like order or arrange- 
ment. Everything had been heaped 
in promiscuously. Having assorted 50

all with care, we found ourselves pos- 
sessed of even vaster wealth than we 
‘had at first supposed. In coin there 
was rather more than four hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars—estimat- 
ing the value of the pieces, as accu- 
rately as we could, by the tables. of 
the period. There was not a particle 
of silver. All was gold of antique 
date and of great variety: French, 
Spanish, and German money, with a 
few English guineas, and some coun- 
ters of which we had never seen speci- 
mens before. ‘There were several very 
large and heavy coins, so worn that 
we could make nothing of their in- 
There was no American 
money. The value of the jewels we 
found more difficulty in estimating. 
There were diamonds—some of them 
exceedingly large and fine—~a hundred 
and ten in all, and not one of them 
small; eighteen rubies of remarkable 
brilliancy; three hundred and ten 
emeralds, all very beautiful; and 
‘twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. 
These stones had all been broken from 
their settings and thrown loose in 
the chest. The settings themselves, 
which we picked out from among the 
other gold, appeared to have been 
beaten up with hammers, as if to 
prevent identification. Besides all this, 
there was. a vast quantity of solid 
gold ornaments: nearly two hundred 
massive finger- and ear-rings; rich 
chains—thirty of these, if I remember; 
eighty-three very large and heavy 
crucifixes; five gold censers of great 
value; a prodigious golden punch- 
bowl, ornamented with richly chased 
vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; 
two swordhandles exquisitely em- 
bossed; and many other smaller ar- 
ticles which I cannot recollect. The 
weight of these valuables exceeded 
three hundred and fifty pounds avoir- 
dupois; and in this estimate I have

THE GOLD BUG 
Well, as I was in the very act of 
crumpling it up, my glance fell upon 
the sketch at which you had been 
looking, and you may imagine my 
astonishment when I perceived, in 
fact, the figure of a death’s-head just 
where, it seemed to me, I had made 
the drawing of the beetle. For a 
moment I was too much amazed to 
think with accuracy. I knew that my 
design was very different in detail 
from this—although there was a cer- 
iain similarity in general outline. 
Presently I took a candle, and, seating 
myself at the other end of the room, 
proceeded to scrutinize the parchment 
more closely. Upon turning it over, 
I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, 
just as I had made it. My first idea, 
now, was mere surprise at the really 
remarkable similarity of outline—at 
the singular coincidence involved in 
the fact that, unknown to me, there 
should have been a skull upon the 
other side of the parchment, imme- 
diately beneath my figure of the 
searabeeus, and that this skull, not 
only in outline, but in size, should so 
closely resemble my drawing. I say 
the singularity of this coincidence 
absolutely stupefied me for a time. 
This is the usual effect of such coin- 
cidences. The mind struggles to es- 
tablish a connection—-a sequence of 
cause and effect—and, being unable 
to do so, suffers a species of temporary 
paralysis. But when I recovered from 
this stupor, there dawned upon me 
gradually a conviction which startled 
me even far more than the coinci- 
dence. I began distinctly, positively, 
to remember that there had been no 
drawing on the parchment when I 
made my sketch of the scarabeus. I 
became perfectly certain of this; for 
I recollected turning up first one side 
and then the other, in search of the 
cleanest spot. Had the skull been 
then there, of course I could not have | 67 
failed to notice it. Here was indeed 
a mystery which I felt it impossible 
to explain; but, even at that early 
moment, there seemed to glimmer, 
faintly, within the most remote and 
secret chambers of my intellect, a 
glow-worm-like conception of that 
truth which last night’s adventure 
brought to so magnificent a demon- 
stration. I arose at once and, putting 
the parchment securely away, dis- 
missed all further reflection until I 
should_be alone. 
“When you had gone, and when 
Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook my- 
self to a more methodical investigation 
of the affair. In the first place I 
considered the manner in which the 
parchment had come into my pos- 
session. The spot where we discovered 
the scarabeeus was on the coast of the 
mainland, about a mile eastward of 
the island, and but a short distance 
above high-water mark. Upon my 
taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp 
bite, which caused me,to let it drop. 
Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, 
before seizing the insect, which had 
flown toward him, looked about him 
for a leaf, or something of that nature, 
by which to take hold of it. It was at 
this moment that his eyes, and mine, 
also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, 
which I then supposed to be paper. 
It was lying half-buried in the sand, 
a corner sticking up. Near the spot 
where we found it, I observed the 
remnants of the hull of what appeared 
to have been a ship’s long boat. 
The wreck seemed to have been there 
for a very great while; for the re- 50 
semblance to boat timbers could - 
scarcely be traced. 
“Well, Jupiter picked up the parch- 
ment, wrapped the beetle in it, and 
gave it to me. Soon afterwards we 
turned to go home, and on the way 
met Lieutenant G—~. I showed him 
the insect, and he begged me to let
-P-A-G-E-77
68 - 
him take it to the fort. On my con- 
senting, he thrust it forthwith into 
his waistcoat pocket, without the 
parchment in which it had been 
wrapped, and which I had continued 
to hold in my hand during his inspec- 
. tion, Perhaps he dreaded my chang- 
. ing my mind, and thought it best to 
20 make sure of the prize at once—you 
know ‘how enthusiastic he is on all 
subjects connected with Natural His- 
tory. At the same time, without 
being conscious of it, I must have 
deposited the parchment in my own 
pocket, 
“You remember that when I went 
to the table, for the purpose of mak- 
ing a sketch of the beetle, I found no 
paper where it was usually kept. I 
looked in the drawer, and found none 
there, I searched my pockets, hoping 
to find an old letter, and then my 
hand fell upon the parchment. I 
thus detail the precise mode in which 
it came into my possession; for the 
circumstances impressed me with pe- 
culiar force. 
“No doubt you will think me 
fanciful—but I had already estab- 
lished a kind of connection. I had 
put together two links of a great 
chain. There was a boat lying on 
a seacoast, and not far from the boat 
was a, parchment—not a paper—with 
a skull depicted on it. You will, of 
course, ask ‘Where is the connection?” 
I reply that the skull, or death’s-head, 
is the well-known emblem of the 
pirate. The flag of the death’s-head 
is hoisted in all engagements. 
“I have said that the scrap was 
parchment, and not paper. Parch- 
ment is durable—almost imperishable. 
Matters of little moment are rarely 
consigned to parchment; since, for the 
mere ordinary purposes of . drawing 
or writing, it is not nearly so well’ 
adapted as paper. This reflection 
suggested some meaning—some rele- THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

upon your shoulders. With your left 
hand you caressed him and kept him 
off, while your right, holding the 
parchment, was permitted to fall 
listlessly between your knees, and in 
close proximity to the fire. At one 
moment I thought the blaze had 
caught it, and was about to caution 
you, but, before I could speak, you 
had withdrawn it, and were engaged 
in its examination. When I consid- 
ered all these particulars, I doubted 
not for a moment that heat had been 
the agent in bringing to light, on the 
parchment, the skull which I saw 
designed on it. You are well aware 
that chemical preparations exist, and 
have existed time out of mind, by 
means of which it is possible to write 
on either paper or vellum, so that the 
characters shall become visible only 
when subjected to the action of fire. 
Zaffre digested in agua regia, and di- 
luted with four times its weight of 
water, is sometimes employed; a 
green ‘tint results. The regulus of 
cobalt, dissolved in spirit of niter, 
gives a red. These colors disappear 
at longer or shorter intervals after 
the material written upon cools, but 
again become apparent upon the 
reapplication of heat. 
“J now scrutinized the death’s-head 
with care. Its outer edges—the edges 
of the drawing nearest the edge of the 
vellum—were far more distinct than 
the others. It was clear that the 
action of the caloric had been imper- 
fect or unequal. I immediately kin- 
dled a, fire, and subjected every portion 
‘of the parchment to a glowing heat. 
At first, the only effect was the 
strengthening of the faint lines in the 
skull; but, on persevering in the ex- 
periment, there became visible at the 
corner of the slip, diagonally opposite 
to the spot in which the death’s-head 
was delineated, the figure of what 
I at first supposed to be a goat. A ; 69 
closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me 
that it was intended for a kid.” 
“Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have 
no right to laugh at you—a million 
and a half of money is too serious a 
matter for mirth—but you are not 
about to establish a third link in 
your chain; you will not find any 
especial connection between your pi- 
rates and a goat; pirates, you know, 
have nothing to do with goats; they 
appertain to the farming interest.” 
“But I have just said that the 
figure was not that of a goat.” 
“Well, a kid, then—pretty much 
the same thing.” : 
“Pretty much, but not altogether,” 
said Legrand. “You may have heard 
of one Captain Kidd. I at once looked 
on the figure of the animal as a kind 
of punning or hieroglyphical signa- 
ture.” I say signature, because its 
position on the vellum suggested this 
idea. The death’s-head at the corner 
diagonally opposite had, in the same 
manner, the air of a stamp, or seal. 
But I was sorely put out by the ab- 
sence of all else—of the body to my 
imagined instrument—of the text for 
my context.” 
“JT presume you expected to find a 
letter between the stamp and the 
signature.” 
“Something of that kind. The fact 50 
70 
is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a ~ 
presentiment of some vast good for- 
tune impending. I can scarcely say 
why. Perhaps, after all, it was 
rather a desire than an actual belief; 
but do you know that Jupiter’s silly 
words, about the bug being of solid 
gold, had a remarkable effect on my 
fancy? And then the series of acci- 
dents and coincidences—these were 
so very extraordinary. Do you ob- 
serve how mere an accident it was 
that these events should have oc- 
curred on the sole day of all the year 
in which it has been, or may be, suffi- 90

ciently cool for fire, and that without 
the fire, or without the intervention of 
the dog at the precise: moment in which 
he appeared, I should never have 
become aware of the death’s-head, 
and so never the possessor of the 
treasure?” 
“But proceed—I am all impatience.” 
“Well, you have heard, of course, the 
1o many stories current—the thousand 
vague rumors afloat about money 
buried, somewhere on the Atlantic 
coast, by Kidd and his associates. 
These rumors must have had some 
foundation in fact. And that the 
tumors have existed so long and so 
continuously could have resulted, it 
appeared to me, only from the circum- 
stance of the buried treasure still 
20 remaining entombed. Had Kidd con- 
cealed his plunder for a time, and 
afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors 
-would scarcely have reached us in 
their present unvarying form. You 
will observe that the stories told are 
all about money-seekers, not about 
money-finders. Had the pirate re- 
covered, his money, there the affair 
would have dropped. It seemed to 
30 me that some accident—say the loss 
of a memorandum indicating its lo- 
cality—had deprived him of the means 
of recovering it, and that this accident 
had become known to his followers, 
who otherwise might never have 
heard that treasure had been con- 
cealed at all, and who, busying them- 
selves in’ vain, because unguided, at- 
tempts to regain it, had given first 
40 birth, and then universal currency, to 
the reports which are now so common. 
Have you ever heard of any impor- 
tant treasure being unearthed along 
the coast?” 
“Never.” 
“But that Kidd’s accumulations 
were immense is well known. I took 
it for granted, therefore, that the 
earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you « 
that I felt a hope, nearly amounting 
to certainty, that the parchment so 
strangely found involved a lost record 
of the place of deposit.” 
“But how did you proceed?”. 
“T held the vellum again to the 
fire, after increasing the heat, but 
nothing appeared. I now thought it 
possible that the coating of dirt might 
have something to do with the failure; « 
so I carefully rinsed the parchment 
by pouring warm water over it, and, 
having done this, I placed it in a tin 
pan, with the skull downward, and 
put the pan upon a furnace of lighted 
charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan 
-having become thoroughly heated, I 
removed the slip, and,,to my inex- 
pressible joy, found it spotted, in 
several places, with what appeared to : 
be figures arranged in lines. Again 
I placed it in the pan, and suffered 
it to remain another minute. Upon 
taking it off, the whole was just as 
you see it now.” 
Here, Legrand, having reheated the 
parchment, submitted it to my in- 
spection. The following characters 
were rudely traced, in a red tint, be- 
tween the death’s-head and the goat:

“But,” said I, returning him the 
slip, “I am as much in the dark as 
ever. Were all the jewels of Golconda 
awaiting me on my solution of this 
enigma, I am quite sure that I should 
be unable to earn them.” 
“And yet,” said Legrand, “the 
solution is by no means so difficult as

first hasty inspection of the characters. 
_ These characters, as anyone might 
10 
30 
40 readily guess, form a cipher—that is 
to say, they convey a meaning; but 
then, from what is known of Kidd, 
I could not suppose him capable of 
constructing any of the more abstruse 
cryptographs. I made up my mind, 
at once, that this was of a simple 
species—such, however, as would ap- 
pear, to the crude intellect of the 
sailor, absolutely insoluble without 
the key.” 
“And you really solved it?” 
“Readily; I have solved others of 
an abstruseness ten thousand times 
greater. Circumstances, and a certain 
bias of mind, have Jed me to take in- 
terest in such riddles, and it may well 
be doubted whether human ingenuity 
can construct an enigma of the kind 
which human ingenuity may not, by 
proper application, resolve. In fact, 
having once established connected 
and legible characters, I scarcely gave 
a thought to the mere difficulty of 
developing their import: 
“In the present case—indeed in all 
cases of secret writing—the first ques- 
tion regards the language of the cipher; 
for the principles of solution, so far, 
especially, as the more simple ciphers 
are concerned, depend on, and are 
varied by, the genius of the particular 
idiom. In general, there is no alterna- 
tive but experiment (directed by 
probabilities) of every tongue known 
to him who attempts the solution, 
until the true one be attained. But, 
with the cipher now before us, all 
difficulty is removed by the signature. 
The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is ap- 
preciable in no other language than 
the English. But for this considera- 
tion I should have begun my attempts 
with the Spanish and French, as the 
tongues in which a secret of this kind 
would) most naturally have been 
written by a pirate of the Spanish 7 
Main. As it was, I assumed the 
cryptograph to be English. 
“You observe there are no divisions 
between the words. Had there been 
divisions, the task would have been 
comparatively easy. In such case 
I should have commenced with a 
collation and analysis of the shorter 
words, and, had a word of a. single 
letter occurred, as is most likely (a or 
I, for example), I should have con- 
sidered the solution as assured. But 
there being no division, my first step 
was to ascertain the predominant 
letters, as well as the least frequent. 
Counting all, I constructed a table, 
thus: 
Of the character 8 there are 33

harstuycfglmwhkpqez E 
predominates, however, so remark- 
ably that an individual sentence of 
any length is’ rarely seen, in which 
it is not the prevailing character. 
“Here, then, we have, in the very 
beginning, the groundwork for some- 
thing more than a mere guess. The 
general use which may be made of 
the table is obvious—but, in this 
particular cipher, we shall only very

10 partially require its aid. As our 
predominant character is 8, we will 
commence by ‘assuming it as the e 
of the natural alphabet. To verify 
‘the supposition, let us observe if the 
8 be seen often in couples—for ¢ 
is doubled with great frequency in 
English—in such words, for example, 
as meet, fleet, speed, seen, been, agree, etc. 
In the present instance we see it 
doubled no less than five times, 
although the cryptograph is brief. 
“Let us assume 8, then, as e. Now 
of all words in the language, the is 
most usual; let us see, therefore, 
whether there are not repetitions of 
any three characters, in the same 
‘order of collocation, the last of them 
being 8. If we discover repetitions of 
such letters, so arranged, they will 
most probably represent the word 
the.’ On inspection, we find no less 
than seven such arrangements, the 
characters being ;48. We may, there- 
fore, assume that the semicolon repre- 
sents ¢, that 4 represents h, and that 
8 represents e—the last being now well 
confirmed. Thus a great step has 
been taken. 
“But, having established a single 
word, we are enabled to establish a 
vastly important point; that is -to 
say, several commencements and ter- 
minations of other words. Let us 
refer, for example, to the last instance 
but one, in which the combination 
348 occurs—not far from the end of 
the cipher. We know that the semi- 
colon immediately ensuing is the 
commencement of a word, and, of the 
six characters succeeding this the, we 
are cognizant of no less than five. 
Let us set these characters down, 
thus, by the letters we know them 
to represent, leaving a space for the 
unknown—

represented, and it will be umneces-

convince you that ciphers of this 
nature are readily soluble, and to give

their development. But be assured

seats,” ‘death’s-heads,’ and ‘bishop’s 
hostels’?”’ 
“T confess,” replied Legrand, “that 
the matter still wears a serious aspect, 60 
when regarded with a casual glance. 
My first endeavor was to divide the 
sentence unto the natural division in- 
tended by the cryptographist.” 
“You mean, to punctuate it?” 
“Something of that kind.” 
“But how is it possible to effect 
this?” 
“T reflected that it had been a point 
with the writer to run his words to- 7 
gether without division, so as to in- 
crease the difficulty of solution. Now, 
a not over-acute man, in pursuing such 
an object, would be nearly certain to 
overdo the matter. When, in the 
course of his composition, he arrived 
at a break in his subject which would , 
naturally require a pause, or a point, 
he would be exceedingly apt to run 
his characters, at this place, more than so 
usually close together. If you will 
observe the MS., in the present in- 
stance, you will easily detect five such 
cases of unusual crowding. Acting on 
this hint, I made the division thus: 
“*4 good glass in the Bishop’s hostel 
in the devil’s seat—twenty-one degrees 
and thirteen minutes—northeast and by 
north—main branch seventh. limb east 
side—shoot from the left eye of thedeath’s- 90 
head—a bee-line from the tree through 
the shot fifty feet out.’”

“Even this division,”’ said I,-“leaves 
me still in the dark.” 
“Tt left me also in the dark,” replied 
Legrand, “for a few days; during which 
I made diligent inquiry, in the neigh- 
borhood of Sullivan’s Island, for any 
building which went by the name of 
the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’; for, of course, I 
dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ 
Gaining no information on the subject, 
I was on the point of extending my 
sphere of search, and proceeding in a 
more systematic manner, when one 
morning it entered into my head, quite 
suddenly, that this. ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ 
might have some reference to an old 
family, of the name of Bessop, which, 
time out of mind, had held possession 
of an ancient manor house, about four 
miles to the northward of the island. 
I accordingly went over to the planta- 
tion, and reinstituted my inquiries 
among the older negroes of the place. 
At length one of the most aged of the 
women said that she had heard of such 
a place as Bessop’s Castile, and thought 
that she could guide me to it, but that 
it was not a castle, nor a tavern, but 
a high rock. 
“I offered to pay her well for her 
trouble, and, after some demur, she 
consented to accompany me to the 
spot. We found it without much 
difficulty, when, dismissing her, I pro- 
ceeded to examine the place. The 
‘castle’ consisted of an irregular as- 
semblage of cliffs and rocks—one of 
the latter being quite remarkable for 
its height as well as for its insulated 
and artificial appearance. I clambered 
to its apex, and then felt much at a 
loss as to what should be next done. 
“While I was busied in reflection, 
my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in the 
eastern face of the rock, perhaps a 
yard below the summit upon which I 
stood. This ledge projected about 
eighteen inches, and was not more than 
a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

chairs used by our an:

THE GOLD BUG © 15 
a “On this discovery I was so sanguine 
d as to consider the enigma solved; for 
e the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, 
8 east side,’ could refer only to the posi- 
I tion of the skull on the tree, while 
e ‘shoot.from the left eye of the death’s- 
head’ admitted, also, of but one inter- 
d pretation, in regard to a search for 
- buried treasure. I perceived that the 
Y | 10 design was to drop a bullet from the .

where the bullet fell), and thence ex- 
tended to a distance of fifty feet, 
would indicate a definite point—and 
beneath this point I thought it at 
least possible that a deposit of value 
20 lay concealed.”” 
“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly 
clear, and, although ingenious, still 
simple and explicit. When you left 
the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?” 
“Why, having carefully taken the 
bearings of the tree, I turned home- 
ward. The instant that I left ‘the 
devil’s seat,’ however, the circular rift 
vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of

experiment has convinced me it is a

question is visible from no other attain- 
able point of view than that afforded 
by the narrow ledge on the face of the 
rock, 
“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s 
40 Hotel’ I had been attended by Jupiter, 
who had no doubt observed, for some 
weeks past, the abstraction of my de- 
meanor, and took especial care not to 
leave me alone. But on the next day, 
getting up very early, I contrived to 
give him the slip, and went into the 
hills in search of the tree. After much 
toil I found it. When I came home at 
night my valet proposed to give me a ft 
seems to me the chief ingenuity in this — 
whole business, is the fact (for repeated flogging. With the rest of the ad- 50 
venture I believe you aré as well 
acquainted as myself.” | 
“TI suppose,” said I, “you missed the 
spot, in the first attempt at digging, 
through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting 
the bug fall through the right instead 
of through the left eye of the skull.” 
“Precisely. This mistake made a 
difference of about two inches and a 
half in the ‘shot’ that is to say, in the oo 
position of the peg nearest the tree; 
and had the treasure been beneath the 
‘shot,’ the error would have been of 
little moment; but the ‘shot,’ together 
with the nearest point of the tree, were 
merely two points for the establish- 
ment of a line of direction; of course 
the error, however trivial in the be- 
ginning, increased as we proceeded 
with the line, and, by the time we had 70 
gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the 
scent. But for my deep-seated con- 
victions that treasure was here some- 
where actually buried, we might have 
had all our labor in vain.” 
“T presume the fancy of the skull— 
of letting fall a bullet through the 
skull’s eye—was suggested to Kidd by 
the piratical flag. No doubt he felt a 
kind of poetical consistency in recover- 80 
ing his money through this ominous 
insignium.” 
“Perhaps so; still, I cannot help 
thinking that common-sense had quite 
as much to do with the matter as 
poetical consistency. To be visible 
from the devil’s seat, it was necessary 
that the object, if‘small, should ‘be 
white; and there is nothing like your 
human skull for retaining and even 90 
increasing its whiteness under exposure 
to all vicissitudes of weather.” 
“But your grandiloquence, and your 
conduct in swinging the beetle—how 
excessively odd! I was sure you were 
mad. And why did you insist on let- 
ting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, 
from the skull?”
-P-A-G-E-85

“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat 
annoyed by your evident suspicions 
touching my sanity, and so resolved to 
punish you quietly, in my own way, 
by a little bit of sober mystification. 
For this reason I swung the beetle, and 
for this reason I let it fall from the tree. 
An observation of yours about its 
great weight suggested the latter idea.” 
“Yes, I perceive; and now there is 
only one point which. puzzles me. 
What are we to make of the skeletons 
found in the hole?” 
“That is a question I am no more 
able to answer than yourself. There THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
seems, however, only one 
way of accounting for ther: 
it is dreadful to believe in su 
as my suggestion would im 
clear that Kidd—if Kidd ind 
ed this treasure, which I dc 
it is clear that he must have 
ance in the labor. But, th 
this labor concluded, he 
thought it expedient to tune wer 
participants in his secret. Perhaps a 
couple of blows with a mattock were 
sufficient, while his coadjutors were 
busy in the pit; perhaps it required a 
dozen—who shall tell?” 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Exruanatory Notes 
1. In discussing “The Masque of the Red 
Death,” in Junior High School Literature, 
Book ‘Two, it was noted that Poe was a leader 
-in the development of the short story. In 
general, his short stories fall into two classes: 
first, those in which he aims to produce upon 
the reader an overwhelming impression of 
. horror or terror; and second, those in which he 
provides a mystery and its solution. “The 
Masque of the Red Death” is a type of the 
former and “The Gold Bug” is one of the best 
of the latter. “The Gold Bug” has in’ it a 
strong element of adventure, but Poe’s chief - 
interest was in the mystery, as is shown by 
the fact that the major climax of the story is 
reserved for the part in which is related the 
deciphering of the cryptograph. In general, a 
short story has an introduction, a main inci- 
dent, a point of highest interest, or climax, and 
a conclusion, but in “The Gold Bug” each of 
the two main divisions of the story has these 
essential parts, 
2. Poe received a prize of one hundred 
‘dollars for this story, which was first published 
in a newspaper. The story is the most famous 
of the many that have been written about 
Captain Kidd, the notorious Scottish pirate 
vhose exploits for the most part are associated 
with the coast of the Carolinas, and who was 
hanged in London in 1701. Poe is therefore 
accurate in placing the scene of the story: on 
Sullivan’s Island, though his description of 
the island has been criticized for inaccuracies, 
in spite of the fact that he was stationed at 
Fort Moultrie in 1828. For the “gold bug” itself, Poe drew chiefly upon his imagination; 
there are various so-called “gold” bugs, but 
the peculiar markings of the bug in this story 
are not recorded in scientific books. Interest 
in scientific matters can be found. in much 
of Poe’s work, He was an expert in cryptog- 
raphy, and wrote an essay on the subject. 
QuEstions anp ToPics 
1. Tell why the title is a good one. What 
two distinct parts did you note in the story? 
Which of these was the more interesting to 
you? Where does the one end and the other 
begin? 
2, Which paragraphs serve as an introduc- 
tion? What information do these paragraphs 
give you? The island is lonely, yet inhabited; 
ig this detail essential to the story? Who is 
the most important character? What did he 
like best to do? Who accompanied him on his 
excursions? Do you feel sure-that you under- 
stand what sort of man Legrand was? Do 
any details suggest that he was a trifle un- 
balanced? 
8. In a good short story there are no un- 
necessary details; account for Poe’s emphasis 
on the chilliness of the weather in the descrip- 
tion of the first visit; recount the circumstances 
by which he leads naturally to the necessity 
for paper; the friend is chilly and retains his 
seat by the fire—show that Poe planned this 
detail; the dog enters and caresses him—~show 
the necessity for this detail; note the long 
conversation emphasizing Legrand’s behavior 
in reference to the death’s-head and give the 
purpose of this detail. Is this the. first hint

of mystery? In your first reading of the story, 
where did you begin to suspect the object of the 
expedition? Where is it first mentioned in the © 
story? 
4, A good story teller holds interest. by- 
i tosity and creating suspense; 
note in the second visit all the details by which 
Poe accomplishes these objects. Does it make 
this part of the story more interesting, or less 
so, to have the friend and Jupiter (and the 
reader) left in doubt as to what is in Legrand’s 
mind? What isthe most interesting point in 
the account of the expedition? What devices 
does Poe use to heighten interest at this im- 
portant. point, from the howlings of the dog 
to the finding of the treasure? In the conclu- 
+sion of the first part, an appearance of truth is 
given by exact statements of number and 
quantity; what effect had these details upon 
you at first reading? 
5._ Is it essential that Poe should make 
Legrand certain that there had been no figure 
on the “paper” when he made his drawing? 
Explain all the steps by which Legrand brought 
to light the cryptograph on the parchment. Is 
the presence of the parchment in Legrand's 
pocket satisfactorily accounted for? Do you 
think all the details connected with the bringing 
to light of the original designs and figures upon 
the parchment are probable? Explain how 
Legrand determined that the figure 8 of the 
cryptograph represented the letter e. Why 
are not all the details of the solution given? 
What is the most interesting point in Legrand’s 
account of how he solved the mystery? 
6. The conclusion relates the events fol- 
lowing the discovery and verification of the 
eryptograph, and explains some of the mystify- 7% 
ing incidents connected with the discovery of 
the treasure; in your first reading of the story, 
what details and incidents puzzled you? Are 
they all satisfactorily explained? 
7. Do all points in the story seem probable 
to you? For example, does it seem probable 
that Captain Kidd would have hidden his 
treasure in the place described? If so, do you 
think of him as locating the tree from the 
“devil's seat,” or locating the seat from the 
tree? Does it seem probable to you that the 
circular rift, or opening, through which the 
skull could be seen would remain unchanged 
after such @ lapse of time? 
8. Much of the story is made up of con- 
versation; which do you like the better, stories 
that contain much dialogue or those that are 
mainly narration? Is the dialogue in this 
story lifelike? Is Jupiter more or less lifelike 
in conversation than Legrand and his friend? 
9. Did }ou enjoy the story? Did it mystify 
you? Did you want to lay it aside before you 
had finished it? Does this story meet the 
test of literature about which you read in the 
Introduction on page 9? What other stories 
of mystery have you read? How do they com- 
pare with this story?

STEVENSON’S “TREASURE ISLAND” 
AN INTRODUCTION’ , 
Now and then it is given to a man not 
only to. create, through his books, a world 
of. rich variety and never-ending adven- 
ture, but also to live in this world himself 
and thus to become in a way the hero of 
his own stories. Such a man was Walter 
Scott, who re-created in his romances the 
life of past times and who also became 
himself a sort of feudal lord, dispensing 
bounty to his retainers, living the large and 
generous Kfe of his own heroes. Such a 
man, also, was the author of Treasure 
Island, who wrote, in his own youth, the 
story of a boy’s wonderful adventures on a 
mysterious island in search of pirate gold, 
and at length himself set out in a small 
yacht to seek and to find hidden treasure 
of a different kind in the islands of the 
South Seas. 
In a sense, this parallelism between the 
books and the lives of these two great men 
is only an illustration of a fact that may 
be constantly observed. Any great book 
is the expression of the innermost person- 
ality of its author. It reflects his interests, 
his views of life. Ivanhoe, The Lady of the 
Lake, and the rest of Scott’s heroic ro- 
mances are only manifestations of the 
personality that found another expression 
in the life at Abbotsford, about which you 
will read later in this book. And Treasure 
Island, a boy’s search for hidden treasure, 
with its delightful suggestion of the mys- 
terious and all the other qualities that 
make it the .best story of its kind ever 
written, is just an expression of Stevenson 
himself. He did not go after pirate’s gold, 
but the whole life of this boy who once 
studied law in Edinburgh and who, still 
a young man, died in far-off Samoa, was 
not unlike the quest on which Jim Hawkins 
set forth, The great book is an epitome of 
the great life. 
It is not merely an imitation, however, 
this life that seems to parallel the book. 
For example, it is true that Scott liked to fancy himself a sort of re-incarnation of 
one of his heroic ancestors centuries before 
his own time. His letters, and the Life 
by Lockhart, give abundant evidence of 
this.. Outwardly it was as though a man 
nowadays should try to imitate in his home 
and his way of living the life led in Colon- 
ial or Revolutionary times. But the true 
parallel is seen in the way in which Scott 
met life. When disaster came upon him, 
and he manfully discharged his obliga- 
tions, like the knight at arms that he was; 
when in the crisis and indeed throughout 
his whole life he lived up to his own ideals 
of the chivalry that he praised in his 
romances, the parallel between the man 
and his books became a living thing. It 
was not a spectacular sort of heroism 
that he exhibited; it was only the sort of 
heroism that is another name for duty, 
that made him sit down to unceasing work 
in order that innocent people should not 
suffer through the business failure of his 
partners. There is a similar connection 
between the story that you are now to 
read and the life of its author. Though 
the hidden treasure that Robert. Louis 
Stevenson sought and found, in a search 
that took him on a longer journey than 
Homer’s Ulysses ever knew, was not pirate 
gold, Treasure Island is a sort of uncon- 
scious prediction of the kind of life its 
’ author was destined to lead. 
79 I , 
Robert Louis Stevenson was born in 
Edinburgh, November 18, 1850. His 
father and grandfather were civil engineers 
of distinction, their special work being 
lighthouse .construction, and from his 
father the young Writer learned much 
about nautical terms and the language that 
gives raciness to his story of the sea. From 
his mother, who belonged to a family of 
scholars and ministers, the boy inherited 
much of his literary instinct.
-P-A-G-E-89
80 THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
As a boy he was handicapped by bad 
health that made his schooling somewhat 
irregular and prevented him from joining 
in the sports of his fellows. He was fond 
of the out-of-doors, however, and spent 
. much time in the country. He became a 
great reader, especially of tales of adven- 
ture and of English poetry. His instinct 
toward self-expression showed itself even 
before he could write. In his sixth year, 
he dictated a “History of Moses,” and at 
nine was the author of a manuscript to 
which he gave the title “Travels in Perth.” 
Between his eleventh and sixteenth years 
he wrote, edited, and illustrated many 
“magazines.” ~ When he was sixteen, he 
wrote a historical essay which was printed. 
This early interest in writing became a 
dominant force in his life. He tells us that 
he rarely took a walk without two. books 
in his pocket, one for reading and the other 
a blank book in which to note down some 
observation or to write a bit of description. 
He was especially interested in descrip- 
tion, since, as he said, the materials were 
everywhere. He says that he was ambi- 
tious to become a writer, but that the chief 
thing he wanted was to know how to write. 
The story of these formative years in the 
life of a great writer is a convincing proof 
that skill in the art comes not by birth 
or, by chance, but by incessant practice. 
The young Stevenson wrote. constantly, 
criticized his own writing severely, pub- 
~ lished almost nothing. He studied words 
as if they were jewels. He tried various 
ways of saying what he thought he had to 
say, until he could say it as he wanted to 
say it. In his masterpieces his style is so 
simple, so easy and graceful, that the 
reader is apt to forget what long and 
patient practice preceded the writing of 
what seems as natural as talking. 
In November of 1867 Stevenson entered 
the University of Edinburgh. He found 
little in the course of study that attracted 
him. He described himself as an idler and 
a truant, but he was making the best pos- 
sible use of his time in the light of what 
he was todo. Foreign travel had sharp- 
ened his powers of observation; he was 
curious about life; he made many ac- 
quaintances. All the time he kept on with 
his reading and with his practice of com- position. Most of what he wrote he 
destroyed. He planned a history of Scot- 
land, and in preparation for this made a 
study of the old documents and other 
historical materials that serv | 
in his later stories of Scott ! 
this respect, as in many other: 
us of Sir Walter Scott. Lik: 
he was finding adventures b: 
and in life. 
His family expected him to follow his 
father and grandfather in the prof. — 
engineering, and he carried on hi: 
in this direction to such effect tha 
he won a silver medal given by the Edin- 
burgh Society of Arts for an essay on an 
improved lighthouse. His interest in the 
sea and in out-of-doors employment was a 
point in favor of his choice of engineering 
as a profession, but he lacked the physical 
strength for it, and decided upon the law. 
This study he began in 1871, and four years 
later he was admitted to the bar. 
Stevenson never practiced law. His 
health was precarious; his law studies had 
been interrupted because of a nervous 
attack and trouble with his lungs that 
necessitated a year of foreign travel. Al 
ways he was writing, destroying, writing 
again, It is interesting to observe that he 
planned to be an engineer, later studied 
law and was admitted to practice, and still 
later was a candidate for a professorship 
of history at Edinburgh, all of them sub- 
stantial professions of the sort that would 
appeal to a young man of parts, but he was 
not destined to follow any of them. He 
was gradually drawing nearer to the one 
thing he had most at heart, and was com- 
pelled to follow it by a force outside him- 
self. 
In 1876 his career really began. He 
wrote, 1876-8, a series of essays and short 
papers for the Cornhill Magazine. In the 
same years three of his best known stories 
appeared in the magazines: “A Lodging for 
a Night,” “The Sire de Maletroit’s Door,” 
and “Will o’ the Mill.” His first book, 
An Inland Voyage, appeared in 1878 and 
was followed soon after by The New 
Arabian Nights’ Entertainment, and Travels 
with a Donkey. All these—the essays for 
Cornhill, the stories, and the books—were 
notable experiments in story, description,
-P-A-G-E-90
TREASURE ISLAND 81 
and essay, the forms of writing in which he 
excelled. He won no immediate fame, 
except among a few keen-sighted men who 
saw that a great new writer was appearing, 
but: this “fit audience, though few,” loved 
his work for the same reason that we love 
it today, for its rare personal charm, its 
keen observation, its humor, and its clear 
and delightful style. 
I 
And now Stevenson began, like Jim 
Hawkins, his search for the hidden trea- 
sure. In 1879 he made the Jong journey 
from Scotland to San Francisco. His love 
of adventure, satisfying a roving disposi- 
tion that had been born in him; the thought 
that he might improve his health, now a 
source of constant concern; and a desire to 
be independent, all combined to influence 
him. He made the journey by emigrant 
ship and emigrant train, to save money, 
and also that he might observe life at first 
hand. He gathered the materials for his 
book, The Amateur Eimigrant, and wrote 
for magazines and for California papers. 
There is no space here to tell the fascinat- 
ing story of his adventures: how he was 
seized by an illness in San Francisco that 
nearly cost his life; how he came near 
starving because he would not let his 
relatives know he was out of money; how 
great happiness came into his life when, 
in 1880, he married Mrs. Osbourne. The 
next year he returned, with his bride, to 
Edinburgh, and a little later began work 
upon Treasure Island. With this book, 
which first appeared as a serial and in 1883 
was reprinted in book form, he won fame. 
The story grew out of a suggestion by his 
step-son, Lloyd Osbourne, and was thus 
written for a boy and therefore for all 
boys. It was planned around a map, which 
you will find reproduced on page 187. To 
a friend he wrote, while he was developing 
the story: “Will you be surprised to learn 
that it is about buccaneers, that it begins 
in the Admiral Benbow public house on 
Devon coast, that it’s all about a map, 
and a treasure, and a mutiny, and a derelict 
ship, and a current, and a fine old squire 
Trelawney . and a doctor, and 
a sea-cook with one leg, and a sea-song 
with the chorus ‘Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum’ (at the third Ho you heave at the 
capstan bars), which is a real buccaneer’s . 
song, only known to the crew of the late 
Captain Flint?” How deeply fascinated 
he was by his work appears in another 
letter: “It’s awful fun, boys’ stories; you 
just indulge the pleasure of your heart, 
that’s all; no trouble, no strain.” 
What made this book a masterpiece, of 
course, was this zest, this spirit of keen 
enjoyment, flowing through’a pen that had 
been trained by years of incessant toil. It 
seemed to write itself, as its author says, 
but the mastery was the mastery of a man 
who comes to a tennis match in the per- 
fection of form won. through years of 
practice. Such a player seems unconscious 
of any effort, any strain; but sight and 
nerve and muscle work in perfect harmony 
because of the training they have under- 
gone. : 
Some account of the plot, the characteri- 
zation, and the style of this book will be 
given in connection with your study of it. 
At this point our’ story need be inter- 
rupted only long enough to show that 
something besides the writer’s craftsman- 
ship comes in to make the book significant. 
The story begins, you have just read, 
“tn the Admiral Benbow public-house on 
Devon coast,” and “it is about bue- 
caneers.” These words take us back at 
once to the days of Sir Walter Raleigh, 
who was a Devon man, and recall his 
raids on the Spanish treasure ships, his 
marvelous voyage to Guiana andthe 
equally marvelous account that he wrote 
of it, and his story of the Revenge. Some 
of this material you doubtless already 
know. If you like Treasure Island, 
you might tead Tennyson’s ballad “The 
Revenge,” or Sir Walter’s account on 
which the ballad is based, and you might 
try to find Raleigh’s story of his journey 
io Guiana. Treasure Island, of course, 
belongs to a later time, but it is all of a 
piece, in a way, for the buccaneers them- 
selves are ‘related to the times and the 
adventures in which Raleigh, Drake, and 
the other Elizabethan “knights errant of 
the sea” had a part. For the privateers

pirate ships; their crews were called 
“brethren of the coast.” Their chief pro-

vision was dried goats’ meat, called 
“boucan,”’ and the name buccaneer comes 
from this word. In the eighteenth century 
there were thousands of these pirates in 
the West Indies and along the Atlantic 
Coast, degenerate followers of Sir Walter, 
who head not his patriotic aims; and the 
stories of Captain Kidd, Morgan, Black- 
beard, and Bonnet are illustrations of the 
extent of this unlawful trade. 
Because of its stirring quality, boys of 
all ages read eagerly Treasure Island. It 
was translated into many languages, and 
is the most famous of pirate stories. 
Stevenson immediately set to work upon 
another boys’ story, Black Arrow, which 
appeared in 1883. Two years later a col- 
lection of verses for children that grown- 
ups also like to'read was published under 
the title of A Child’s Garden of Verses, and 
has become the classic of its kind. Kid- 
napped, a story of the Highlands, followed 
in 1886,’ together with the famous Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Then this period 
of intense literary activity was brought to 
an end by another failure of the author’s 
health and his second and final pilgrimage 
from home. 
I 
The winter of 1887-8 was spent at 
Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks, where 
it was hoped that Stevenson might be cured 
of his lung trouble. He spent the days 
out-of-doors in the intense cold of a 
mountain winter. What writing he was 
able to do was sent to Scribner’s Magazine 
and attracted the attention of S. S. 
McClure; who offered the author $10,000 
for a series of letters from the South Seas, 
And so, a few years after the story of the 
cruise of the Hispaniola had been written, 
- the author of the story was fitting up a 
small ship in which to sail farther from 
his Scottish home than Jim Hawkins ever 
sailed from Devon, to a destination as 
remote and mysterious, viewed from Edin- 
burgh, as the treasure island itself. 
In June, 1888, the yacht Casco sailed 
through the Golden Gate. After a long 
cruise in the southern Pacific, the Steven- 
sons put in at Honolulu, where, six months 
later, they took passage in a rough trad- 
ing schooner en route for the myriads’ of ‘THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
islands that dot the South Pacifi: 
visiting several groups of islan 
went to Samoa, and finally to 
Here Stevenson found he could | 
as the climate aggravated his tr: 
in April of 1890 he returned tc 
where he bought four hundred ac 
Apia and gave to his estate the 
Vailima. After a few months c. _ - 
journeying among the islands, he returned, 
in September, to build the home that, he 
was to occupy for the few remaining years 
of his life. 
Though an exile, he was happy. The 
natives loved him and his stories. They 
called him Tusitala, “teller of tales.” A 
new period of intense literary activity 
began and lasted until his death, He 
began work at six in the morning, and 
except for a brief interval at noon, kept 
at it until four or five o’clock in the after- 
noon. His letters to English friends show 
his happiness and his apparent health. 
One of the books that he worked upon, 
Weir of Hermiston, was the most mature of 
all the volumes that you see in that long 
row of books named “The Complete 
Works of Robert Louis Stevenson,” but 
it was never finished. On the third of 
December, 1894, after a particularly hap- 
py day, the end came without warning and 
without pain. 
IV 
Tusitala, teller of tales, was dead. In 
this far-off country the exile had written 
books that will be read as long as jthe 
English language endures. He had also 
made himself a sort of divinity to the 
Samoans. Like the heroes of the old 
myths and epics, he had told them stories 
and had taught them the arts of life. He 
showed them that it was better to work 
their farms than to spend themselves in 
feuds and petty wars. He was instrumen- 
tal in securing the release of a number of 
old Samoan chiefs who had been impris- 
oned by Germany, England, and the 
United States because of an uprising. So 
great was their love for him that they 
built a road from Apia through the forests 
and up the mountain to Vailima. They 
called it “The Road of the Loving Heart,”
-P-A-G-E-92
    
and made for it an inscription: ‘“Con- 
sidering the great love of his Excellency 
Tusitala in his loving care of us in our 
tribulation we have made this great gift; it 
shall never be muddy, it shall go on for- 
ever, this road that we have dug.” 
Is it not like a return of the days of the 
old heroes, of Ulysses and Aeneas, with 
their care of their people, their teaching of 
the ways of peace and honest labor, and 
their telling of tales? 
“Tt shall go on forever, this road that 
we have dug.” : 
So this series of hero-stories goes on 
forever. It is told now of Ulysses, again 
of Aeneas; again, at the dim beginning 
of our English race, of Beowulf. It is told 
of Walter Scott. It is told of Robert Louis 
Stevenson. It applies, you see, not merely 
to the stories themselves. “The Complete 
Works of Robert Louis Stevenson” fill 
quite a bit of space in our libraries. They 
fill quite a bit of space in our hearts. But 
they fill this space because Tusitala lived TREASURE ISLAND 
“THE ROAD OF THE LOVING HEART” 83° 
    the life of a hero. Like Ulysses, like 
Aeneas, he was struck by adverse fates. 
He was an exile and a wanderer. His 
life was one long struggle against disease, 
as theirs were long struggles in war and 
banishment. Like them, he joyed in 
the struggle. : 
And now what was this hidden treasure 
that Robert Louis Stevenson, like Jim 
Hawkins, went out to find? The pirates 
he met were not those that we meet in the 
story. Rather, they were the same under 
other names. The hidden treasure was not 
gold buried under a giant tree, to be found 
only if you read accurately a queer map. 
What it was is for you to determine. Some 
might say it was health, that he found for 
a few brief years before he died. Some 
might say that it was fame. It might be 
adventure, for his life, like his stories, was 
crowded with adventure: strange cities, 
strange faces, strange modes of life, and 
always a battle, cheerfully borne, against 
the foe that killed him at last. Again, it 
might be happiness, this hidden treasure.
-P-A-G-E-93

In a prayer that he wrote, he said that he 
wished he and those he loved might wake 
“with morning faces and with morning 
hearte—eager to labor—eager to be happy, 
if happiness shall be our portion—and if 
the day be marked for sorrow, strong to 
endure it.” There are other answers that 
might be given. But the story of his life 
shows how a man may realize himself, that 
is, how he.may make real and concrete the ‘ 
thing that he was born to express. His 
father and his grandfather were distin-

CHAPTER I 
Tre Ov Sea Doe at THE 
“ADMIRAL BrnBow” 
Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and 
the rest of these gentlemen having 
asked me to write down the whole 
particulars about Treasure Island, 
from the beginning to the end, keep- 
ing nothing back but the bearings of 
the island, and that only because there 
is still treasure not yet lifted, I take 
up my pen in the year of grace 17—, 
0 and go back to the time when my 
father kept the “Admiral Benbow” member him looking round the cove 
and whistling to himself as he did so, 
and then breaking out in that old 
sea-song that he sang so often after- 
wards: 
Fifteen men on the dead. man’s chest— 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
in the high, old tottering voice that 
“seemed to have been tuned and 
inn, and the brown old seaman, with’ 
the saber cut, first took up his lodging 
under our roof. 
I remember him as if it were yes- 
terday, as he came plodding to the 
inn door, his sea-chest following be- 
hind him in a handbarrow; a tall, 
strong, heavy, nut-brown man; _ his 
tarry pigtail falling over the shoulders 
of his soiled blue coat; his hands 
ragged and scarred, with black, broken 
nails; and the saber cut across one 
cheek, a dirty, livid white. I re- 
85 broken at the capstan bars. Then he 
rapped on the door with a bit of stick 
like a handspike that he carried, and 
when my father appeared, called 
roughly for a glass of rum. This, 
when it was brought to-him, he drank 
slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering 
on the taste, and ‘still looking about 
him at the cliffs and up at our sign- 
board. 
“This is a handy cove,” says he, 
at length; “and a pleasant sittyated 
grog-shop. Much company, mate?” 
My éather told hini no, very little 
company, the more was the pity. 
“Well, then,” said he, “this is the 
berth for me. Here you, matey,”

he cried to the man who trundled the 
barrow; “bring up alongside and help 
up my chest. Tl stay here a bit,” he 
continued. “I’m.a plain man; rum 
and bacon and eggs is what I want, 
and that head up there for to watch 
_ ships off. What you mought call 
me? You mought call me captain. 
Oh, I see what you’re at—there”; and 
10 he threw down three or four gold 
pieces on the threshold. “You can tell 
me when I’ve werked through that,” 
says he, looking as fierce as a com- 
mander. 
. And, indeed, bad as his clothes were, 
and. coarsely as he spoke, he had none 
of the appearance of a man who sailed 
before the mast; but seemed like a 
mate or skipper, accustomed to be 
20 obeyed or to strike. The man who 
came with the barrow told us the mail 
had set him down the morning before 
at the “Royal George”; that he had 
inquired what inns there were along 
the coast, and hearing ours well spoken 
of, I suppose, and described as lonely, 
had chosen it. from the others for his 
place of residence. And that was 
all we could learn of our guest. 
30 He was a very silent man by custom. 
All day he hung round the cove, or 
_upor: the cliffs, with a brass telescope; 
all evening he sat in a corner of the 
parlor next the fire, and drank rum 
and water very strong. Mostly he 
would not speak when spoken to; only 
look up sudden and fierce, and blow 
through his nose like a foghorn; and 
we and the people who came about 
40 our house soon learned to let him be. 
Every day, when he came back from 
his stroll, he would ask if any seafaring 
men had gone by along the road. At 
first. we thought it was the want of 
company of his own kind that made 
him ask this question; but at last we 
began to see he was desirous to avoid 
them. When a seaman put up at the 
“Admiral Benbow” (as now and then _that in the middle of his body. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
some did, making by the coast ro 
for Bristol), he would look in at

any such was present. For 
least, there was no secret ak 
matter; for I was, in a way, : 
in his alarms. He had takem

‘But though I was so terrified by 
the idea of the seafaring man with

captain himself than anybody else 
who knew him. There were nights 
when he took a deal more rum and 
water than his head would carry; and

. which tipped ‘ TREAS URE ISLAND 
then he would sometimes sit and sing 
his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, mind- 
ing nobody; but sometimes he would 
call for glasses round, and force all the 
trembling company to listen to his 
stories or bear a chorus to his singing. 
Often I have heard the house shaking 
with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of 
tum”; all the neighbors joining in for 
dear life, with the fear of death upon 
them, and each singing louder than the 
other, to avoid remark. For in these 
fits he was the most overriding com- 
panion ever known; he would slap 
his hand on the table for silence all 
round; he would fly up in a passion 
of anger at a question, or sometimes 
because none was put, and so he 
judged the company was not following 
his story. Nor would he allow any- 
one to leave the inn till he had drunk 
himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. 
His stories were what frightened 
people worst of all. Dreadful stories 
they were; about hanging, and walk- 
ing the plank, and storms at sea, and 
the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and 
places on the Spanish Main. By his 
own account he must have lived his 
life among some of the wickedest men 
that God ever allowed upon the sea; 
and the language in which he told 
these stories shocked our plain country 
people-almost as much as the crimes 
that he described. My father was 
‘always saying the inn would be ruined, 
for people would soon cease coming 
there to be tyrannized over and put 
down, and sent shivering to their 
beds; but I really believe his presence 
did us good. People were frightened 
at the time, but on looking back they 
rather liked it; it was a fine excite- 
ment in a quiet country life; and there 
was even a party of the younger men 
who pretended to admire him, calling 
him a “true sea dog,” and,a “real old 
‘salt,” and such-like names, and saying 
25. Talking the » plank, walking blindfold on a plank there was the sort of man that made 
England terrible at sea. 
In one way, indeed, he bade fair to 
ruin us; for he kept on staying week 
after week, and at last month after 
month, so that all the money had been 
long exhausted, and still my father 
never plucked up the heart to insist 
on having more. If ever he men- 
tioned it, the captain blew through 
his nose so loudly that you might say 
he roared, and stared my poor father 
out of the room. I have seen hi 
wringing his hands after such a re- 
buff and I am sure the annoyance 
and the terror he lived in must have 
greatly hastened his early and un- 
happy death. 
All the time he lived with us the 
captain made no change whatever in 
his dress but to buy some stockings 
from a hawker. One of the cocks of 
his hat having fallen down, he let it 
hang from that. day forth, though it 
was a great annoyance when it blew. 
IT remember the appearance of his 
coat, which he patched himself up- 
stairs in his room, and which, before 
the end, was nothing but patches. 
He never wrote or received a letter, 
and he never spoke with any but the 
neighbors, and with these, for the 
most part, only when drunk on rum. 
The great sea-chest none of us had 
ever seen open. 
He was only once crossed, and that 
was toward the end, when my poor 
father was far gone in a decline that 
took him off. Dr. Livesey came late 
one afternoon to ‘see the patient, took 
a bit of dinner from my mother, and 
went into the parlor to smoke a pipe 
until his horse should come down from 
the hamlet, for we had no stabling at 
the old “Benbow.” I followed him 
in, and I remember observing the 
contrast the neat, bright doctor, with 
his powder as white as snow, and his 
96. powder as white as snow, an allusion to the custom 
of powdering the hair or the wig. 87

bright black eyes and pleasant man- 
ners, made with the coltish country 
folk, and above all, with that filthy, 
heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate 
of ours, sitting far gone in rum, with 
his arms on the table. Suddenly he— 
the captain, that is—began to pipe up 
his eternal song: 
Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest— 
10 _ Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
Drink and the devil had done for the rest-— 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
At first I had supposed “the dead 
man’s chest” to be that identical big 
box of his upstairs in the front: room, 
and the thought had been mingled in 
my nightmares with that of the one- 
legged seafaring man. But by this 
time we had all long ceased to pay 
20 any particular notice to the song; it 
was new, that night, to nobody but 
Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed 
it did not produce an agreeable effect, 
for he looked up for. a moment quite 
angrily before he went on with his 
talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a 
new cure for the rheumatics. In 
the meantime, the captain gradually 
brightened up at his own musi¢, and 
30 at last flapped his hand upon the table 
before him in a way we all knew to 
mean—silence. The voices stopped 
at once, -all but Dr. Livesey’s; he 
went on as before, speaking clear and 
kind, and drawing briskly at his pipe 
between every word or two. The

harder, and at last broke out with a 
40 villainous, low oath: “Silence, there, 
between decks!” 
“Were you addressing me, sir?” 
says the doctor; and when the ruffian 
had told him, with another oath, that 
this was so, “I have only one thing 
to say to you, sir,” replies the doctor, 
“that if you keep on drinking rum, 
the world will soon be quit of a very 
dirty scoundrel!” THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

CHAPTER II 
Brack Doe Apprars anv Disapprars 
It was not very long after this that 
there occurred the first of the mys- 
terious events that rid us at last of 
the captain, though not, as you will 9 
see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and 
heavy gales; and it was plain from
-P-A-G-E-98

‘me. TREASURE ISLAND 
the first that my poor father was 
little likely to see the spring. He 
sank daily, and my mother and I had 
all the inn upon our hands; and were 
kept busy enough, without paying 
much regard to our unpleasant guest. 
It was one January morning, very 
early—a pinching, frosty morning— 
the cove all gray with hoarfrost, the 
ripple lapping softly on the stones, 
the sun still low and only touching 
the hill-tops and shining far to sea- 
ward. The captain had risen earlier 
than usual, and set out down the 
beach, his- cutlass swinging under the 
broad skirts of the old blue coat, his 
brass telescope under his arm, his 
hat tilted: back upon his head. I 
remember his breath hanging like 
smoke in his wake as he strode off, 
and the last sound I heard of him, as 
he turned the big rock, was a loud 
snort of indignation, as though his 
mind was still running upon Dr. 
Livesey. 
Well; mother was upstairs with 
father; and I was laying the break- 
fast-table against the captain’s return, 
when the parlor door opened, and a 
man stepped in on whom I had never 
set my eyes before. He was a pale, 
tallowy creature, wanting two fingers 
of the left hand; and, though he wore 
a cutlass, he did not look much like 
a fighter. I had always my eye open 
for seafaring men, with one leg or 
two, and I remember this one puzzled 
He was not sailorly, and yet he 
had a smack of the sea about him too. 
T asked him what was for his service, 
and he said he would take rum; but 
as I was going out of the room to 
fetch it he sat down upon a table and 
motioned me to draw near. I paused 
where I was with my napkin in my 
hand. 
“Come here, sonny,” says he. 
“Come nearer here.” I took a step 
nearer. 89 
“Is this here table for my mate 
Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer. 
I told him I did not know his mate 
Bill; and this was for a person who 
stayed i in our house, whom we called 
the captain. 
“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill 
would be called the captain, as like 
as not. He has a cut on one cheek, 
and a mighty pleasant way with him, 
particularly in drink, has my mate 
Bill. We'll put it, for argument like, 
that your captain has a cut on one 
cheek—and we’ll put it, if you like, 
that that cheek’s the right one. Ah, 
well, I told you. Now, is my mate 
Bill in this here house?” 
I told him he was out walking. 
“Which way, sonny? Which way 
is he gone?” 
And when I had pointed out the 
rock and told him how the captain was 
likely to return, and how soon, and 
answered a few other questions, “Ah,” 
said he, “this’ll be as good as drink 
to my mate Bill.” 
The expression of his face as he 
said these words was not at all pleas- 
ant, and I had my own reasons for 
thinking that the stranger was mis- 
taken, even supposing he meant what 
he said. But it was no affair of 
mine, I thought; and, besides, it was 
difficult to know what to do. The 
stranger kept hanging about just 
inside the inn door, peering round the 
corner like’ a cat waiting for a mouse. 
Once I stepped out myself into the 
road, but he immediately called me 
back, and, as I did not obey quick 
enough for his fancy, a most horrible 
change came over his tallowy face, 
and he ordered me in, with an oath 
that made me jump. As soon as I 50 
was back again, he returned to his 
former manner, half fawning, half 
sneering, patted me on the shoulder, 
told me I was a good boy, and he had 
taken quite a fancy tome. “Ihavea

you as two blocks, and he’s all the 
pride of my ‘art. But the great 
thing for boys is discipline, sonny— 
discipline. Now, if you had sailed 
along of Bill, you wouldn’t have 
stood there to be spoke to twice— 
not you. That was-never Bill’s way, 
nor the way of sich as sailed with him. 
10 And here, sure enough, is my mate 
Bill, with a spyglass under his arm, 
bless his old ’art, to be sure. You 
and me’ll just go back into the parlor, 
sonny, and get behind the door, and 
we'll give Bill a little surprise—bless 
his ’art, I say again.” 
So saying, the stranger backed 
along with me into the parlor, and 
put me behind him in the corner, so 
20 that we were both hidden by the 
open door. I was very uneasy and 
alarmed, as you may fancy, and it 
rather added to my fears to observe 
that the stranger was certainly fright- 
ened himself. He cleared the hilt of 
his cutlass and loosened the blade in 
the sheath; and all the time we were 
waiting there he kept swallowing as 
if he felt what we used to call a lump 
30 in the throat. 
At last in strode the captain, 
slammed the door behind him, without 
looking to the right or left, and 
marched straight across the room 
to where his breakfast awaited him. 
“Bill,” said the stranger, in a voice 
that I thought he had tried to make 
bold and big. The captain spun round 
on his heel and fronted us; all the 
40 brown had gone out of his face, and 
even his nose was blue; he had the 
look of a man who sees a ghost, or the 
evil one, or something worse, if any- 
thing can be; and, upon my word, I 
felt sorry to see him, all in a moment, 
turn so old and sick. 
“Come, Bill, you know me; you 
know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” 
said the stranger. The captain made a sort of gasp. 
“Black Dog!” said he. / 
“And who else?” returned the 
other, getting more at his ease. 
“Black Dog as ever was, come for 
to see his old shipmate Billy, at the 
‘Admiral Benbow’ inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, 
we have seen a sight of times, us two, 
since I Jost them two talons,” holding 
up his mutilated hand. 
“Now, look here,” said the captain; 
“you’ve run me down; here I am; well, 
then, speak up; what is it?” 
“That’s you, Bill,” returned Black 
Dog; “you’re in the right of it, Billy. 
Tl have a glass of rum from this dear 
child here, as I’ve took such a liking 
to; and we'll sit down, if you please, 
and talk square, like old shipmates.” 
When I returned with the rum, 
they were already seated on either - 
‘side of the captain’s breakfast table— 
Black Dog next to the door, and sitting 
sideways, so as to have one eye on 
his old shipmate, and one, as I thought, 
on his retreat. 
He bade me go, and leave the door 
wide open. “None of your keyholes 
for me, sonny,” he said; and I left 
them together, and retired into the 
bar. 8 
For a long time, though I certainly 
did my best to listen, I could hear 
nothing but a low gabbling; but at 
last the voices began to grow higher, 
and I could pick up a word or two, 
mostly oaths, from the captain. 
“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” 
he cried once. And again, “If it 
comes to swinging, swing all, say I.” 
Then all of a sudden there was a 
tremendous explosion of oaths and 
other noises—the chair and table 
went over in a lump, a clash of steel 
followed, and then a cry of pain, and 
the next instant I saw Black Dog 
in full flight, and the captain hotly 
pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, 
and the former streaming blood from 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  50] the left shoulder. Just at the door 
the captain aimed at the fugitive 
‘one last tremendous cut, which would 
certainly have split him to the chine 
had it not been intercepted by our 
big signboard of Admiral Benbow. 
You may see the notch on the lower 
side of the frame to this day. 
That blow was the last of the 
w battle. Once out upon the road, 
co} Black Dog, in spite of his wound, 
showed.a wonderful clean pair of 
heels, and disappeared over the edge 
of the hill in half a minute. The 
captain, for his part, stood staring at 
the signboard like a bewildered man. 
Then he passed his hand over his 
eyes several times, and at last turned 
back into the house. 
» “Jim,” says he, “rum”; and as he 
o| spoke, he reeled a little, and caught 
himself with one hand against the 
"wall. : 
“Are you hurt?” cried I. 
“Rum,” he repeated. -“I must get 
away.from here. Rum! rum!” 
I ran to fetch it; but I was quite 
unsteadied by all that had fallen out, 
and I broke one glass and fouled the 
30 tap, and while I was still getting in 
my own way, I heard a loud fall in 
the parlor, and, running in, beheld 
the captain lying full length upon the 
floor. At the same instant my mother, 
alarmed by the cries and fighting, came 
tunning downstairs to help me. Be- 
tween us we raised his head. He was 
breathing very loud and hard; but his 
eyes were closed, and his face a horri- 
40 ble color. 
“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, 
“what a disgrace upon the house! 
And your poor father sick!” 
In the meantime, we had’ no idea 
what to do to help the captain, nor 
any other thought but that he had got 
his death-hurt in the scuffle with the 
stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, 
and tried to put it down his throat; TR veer TREASURE ISLAND 91 
but his teeth were tightly shut, and so 
his jaws-as strong as iron. It was 
a happy relief for us when the door’ 
opened and Dr. Livesey came in, on 
his visit to my father. 
“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall 
we do? Where is he wounded?” 
“Wounded? A fiddle-stick’s end!’ 
said the doctor. “No more wounded 
than you or J. The man has had a 
stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. oo 
Hawkins, just you run upstairs to 
your husband, and tell him, if possible, 
nothing about it. For my part, I 
must do my best to save this fellow’s _ 
trebly worthless life; and Jim here. 
will get me a basin.” 
When I got back with the basin, the 
doctor had already ripped up the 
captain’s sleeve, and exposed his. 
great sinewy arm. It was tattooed in 70 
several places. “Here’s luck,” “A 
fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his 
fancy,”’ were very neatly and clearly 
executed on the forearm; and up 
near the shoulder there was a sketch 
of a gallows and a man hanging from 
it—done, as I thought, with great 
spirit. — : 
“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touch- 
ing this picture with his finger. “And so 
now, Master Billy Bones, if that be 
your name, we'll have a look at the 
color of your blood. Jim,” he said, 
“are you afraid of blood?” . 
“No, sir,” said I. . 
“Well, then,” said he, “you hold 
the basin”; and with that he took 
his lancet and opened a vein. 
A great deal of blood was taken be-. 
fore the captain opened his eyés and 90 
looked mistily about him. First he 
recognized the doctor with an unmis- 
takable frown; then his glance fell 
upon me, and he looked relieved. But 
suddenly his color changed, and he 
tried to raise himself, crying: 
“Where’s Black Dog?” 
“There is no Black Dog here,” said
-P-A-G-E-101
    -- the doctor, “except what you have on 
_ your own back. You have been 
drinking rum; you have had a stroke, 
precisely as I told you; and I have 
. just, very much against my own will, 
dragged you headforemost out of the 
grave. Now, Mr. Bones—” 
“That’s not my name,” he inter- 
rupted. 
' euch I care,” returned the doctor. 
. “It’s the name of a buccaneer of my 
acquaintance; and I call you by it for 
the sake of shortness, and what I 
have to say to you is this: one glass 
of rum won’t kill you, but if you take 
one you'll take another and another, 
and I stake my wig if you don’t break 
off short, you'll die—do you under- 
‘stand that?—die, and go to your own 
20 place, like the man in the Bible. 
Come, now, make an effort. I'll help 
you to your bed for once.” 
Between us, with much trouble, we 
managed to hoist him upstairs, and 
laid him on his bed, where his head 
fell back on the pillow as if he were 
almost fainting.’ 
“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, 
“T clear my .conscience—the name of 
30 rum for you is death. 
And with that he went off to see my 
father, taking me with him by the 
arm. 
“This is nothing,” he said, as soon 
‘as he had closed the door. “I have 
drawn blood enough to keep him 
quiet a while; he should lie for a week 
where he is—that is the best thing for 
him and you; but another stroke 
40 would settle him.”

and needed quiet; besides, I was 
reassured by the doctor’s words, now 
quoted to me, and rather offended by 
the offer of a bribe. 
“I want none of your money,” said 
I, “but what you owe my father. T’ll 
get you one glass, and no more.” 
When I brought it to him, he seized 
it greedily and drank it out. 
w “Aye, aye,” said he, “that’s some 
better, sureenough. And now, matey, 
did that doctor say how long I was 
to lie here in this old berth?” 
“A week at least,” said I. 
“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I 
can’t do that; they’d have the black 
spot on me by then. The lubbers is 
going about to get the wind of me 
this blessed moment; lubbers as 
» couldn’t keep what they got, and 
want to nail what is another’s. Is 
that seamanly behavior, now, I want

I never wasted good money of mine, 
nor lost it neither; .and I’ll trick ’em 
again. I’m not afraid on ’em. I'l 
shake out another reef, matey, and 
daddle ’em again.” 
As he was thus speaking, he had 
x risen from bed with great difficulty, 
holding to my shoulder with a grip 
that almost made me cry out, and 
moving his legs like so much dead 
weight. His words, spirited as they 
were in meaning, contrasted sadly 
with the weakness of the voice in 
which they were uttered. He paused 
when he had got into a’ sitting position 
on the edge. 
“That doctor’s done me,” he mur- 
mured. “My ears is singing. Lay 
me back.” 
Before I could do much to help him 
he had fallen back again to his former 
place, where he lay for a while silent. 
“Jim,” he said, at length, “you saw 
that seafaring man today?” 
“Black Dog?” I asked. 
“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “He’s 93 
a bad ’un; but there’s worse that 
put him on. Now, if I can’t get 
away nohow, and they tip me the 
black spot, mind ‘you, it’s my old 
sea-chest they’re after; you get on 2 
horse—you can, can’t you? Well, 
then, you get on a horse, and go to— 
well, yes, I will!—to that eternal 
Doctor swab, and tell him to pipe 
all hands—magistrates and sich—and 
he’ll lay ’em aboard at the ‘Admiral 
Benbow’—all old Flint’s crew, man 
and boy, all on ’em that’s left. I 
was first mate, I was, old Flint’s first 
mate, and I’m the on’y one as knows 
the place. He gave it me at Savan- 
nah, when he lay a-dying, like as if 
I was to now, you see. But you 
won’t peach unless they get the black 
spot on me, or unless you see that 
Black Dog again, or a seafaring man 
with one leg, Jim—him above all.” 
“But what is the black spot, cap- 
tain?” T asked. 
“That's a summons, mate.- Pll 
tell you if they get that. But you 
keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and 
Tl share with you equals, upon my 
honor.” 
He wandered a little longer, his 
voice growing weaker; but soon after 
I had given him his medicine, which 
he took like a child, with the remark, 
“Tf ever a seaman wanted drugs, it’s 
me,” he fell at last into a heavy, 
swoon-like sleep, in which J left him. 
What I should have done had ail gone 
well, I do not know. Probably I 
should have told the whole story to 
the doctor; for I was in mortal fear 
lest the captain should repent of his 
confessions and make an end of me. 
But as things fell out, my poor father 
died quite suddenly that evening, 
which put all other matters on one 
side. Our natural distress, the visits 
of the neighbors, the arranging of the 
funeral, and all the work of the ‘inn to 
58. pipe all hands, summon by playing the pipe. 20
-P-A-G-E-103

be carried on in the meanwhile, kept 
me so busy that I had scarcely time 
to think of the captain, far less to be 
afraid of him. , 
He got downstairs next morning, 
to be sure, and had his meals as usual, 
though he ate little, and had more, I 
am afraid, than his usual supply of 
rum, for he helped himself out of the 
10 bar, scowling and blowing through his 
nose, and no one dared to cross him. 
On the night before the funeral he 
was as drunk as ever; and it was 
shocking, in that house of mourning, 
to hear him singing away at his ugly 
old sea-song; but, weak as he was, 
we were all in fear of death for him, 
and the doctor was suddenly taken 
up with a case many miles away, and 
20 was never near the house after my 
father’s death. I have said the cap- 
tain was weak; and indeed he seemed 
rather to grow weaker than regain his 
strength. He clambered up and down 
stairs, and went from the parlor to 
the bar. and back again, and some- 
times put his nose out of doors to- 
smell the sea, holding on to the walls 
as he went for support, and breathing 
30 hard and fast like a man on a steep 
mountain. He never particularly ad- 
dressed me, and it is my belief he had 
as good as forgotten his confidences; 
but his temper was more flighty, and, 
allowing for his bodily weakness, more 
violent than ever. He had an alarm- 
ing way now when he was drunk, of 
drawing his cutlass and laying it bare 
before him on the table. But, with 
40 all that, he minded people less, and 
seemed shut up in his own thoughts 
and rather wandering. Once, for in- 
stance, to our extreme wonder, he 
piped up to a different air, a kind of 
country love-song, that he must have 
. learned in his youth before he had 
begun to follow the sea. 
So things passed until, the day after 
the funeral, and about three o’clock THE WORLD OF. ADVENTURE 
of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, 
I was standing at the door for a 
moment, full of sad thoughts about 
my father, when I saw someone draw- 
ing slowly near along the road. He 
was plainly blind, for he tapped before 
him with a stick, and wore a great 
green shade over his eyes and nose; 
and he was hunched, .as if with age 
or weakness, and wore a ‘huge old 
tattered sea-cloak with a hood, that 
made him appear positively deformed. 
_ I never saw in my life a more dreadful 
looking figure. He stopped a little 
from the inn, and, raising his voice in 
an ‘odd singsong, addressed the air 
in front of him: 
“Will any kind friend inform a poor 
blind man, who has lost the precious 
sight of his eyes in the gracious de; 
fense of his native country, England, 7 
and God bless King George!—where 
or in what part of this country he 
may now be?” 
“You are at the ‘Admiral Benbow,’ 
Black Hill Cove, my good man,” 
said I. 
“T hear a voice,” said he—‘‘a young 
voice. Will you give me your hand, 
my kind young friend, and lead me 
in?” 8 
Theld out my hand, and the horrible, 
soft-spoken, eyeless creature gripped 
it in a moment like a vise. I was so 
much startled that I struggled to 
withdraw; but the blind man pulled 
me close up to him with a single action 
of hisarm.  . . 
“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in 
to the captain.” 
“Sir,” said I, 
dare not.” 
“Qh,” he sneered, “that’s it! Take 
me in straight, or Pll break your 
arm.” : 
And he gave it, as he spoke, a 
wrench that made me cry out. 
“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself 
I mean. The captain is not what he “apon my word I »
-P-A-G-E-104
gs 
  TREASURE ISLAND 
used ‘to: be. He sits with a drawn 
cutlass. Another gentleman—” 
“Come, now, march,” interrupted 
he; and I never heard a voice so 
cruel, and cold, and ugly as that 
blind man’s. It cowed me more than 
the pain; and I began to obey him 
at once, walking straight in at the 
door and toward the parlor, where 
our sick old buccaneer was sitting, 
dazed’ with rum. The blind man 
clung close to me, holding me in one 
iron fist, and leaning almost more of 
his weight on me than I could carry. 
“Lead. me straight up to him, and 
when J’m in view cry out, ‘Here’s a 
friend for you, Bill.’ If you don’t, 
T'll do this”; and with that he gave 
me a twitch that I thought would 
have made me faint. Between this 
and that, I was so utterly terrified of 
the blind beggar that I forgot my 
terror of the captain, and as I opened 
the parlor door, cried out the words 
he had ordered in a trembling voice. 
The poor eaptain raised his eyes, and 
at one look the rum went out of him, 
and left him staring sober. The 
expression of his face was not so 
much of terror as of mortal sickness. 
He made a: movement to rise, but I 
do not believe he had enough force 
left in his body. 
“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” 
said the beggar. “If I can’t see, I 
can hear a finger stirring. Business 
is business. Hold out your left hand. 
Boy, take his left hand by the wrist, 
and bring it near to my right.” 
We both obeyed him to the letter, 
and I-saw him pass something from 
the hollow of the hand that held: his 
stick into the palm of the captain’s, 
which closed upon it instantly. 
“And now that’s done,” said the 
. blind man; and at the words he sud- 
denly left hold of: me, and, with in- 
eredible accuracy and nimbleness, 
skipped’ out of the parlor and into 95 
the road, where, as I still stood mo- 50 
tionless, I could hear his stick go 
tap-tap-tapping into the distance. 
It was some time before either I 
or the captain seemed to gather our 
senses; but at length, and about at 
the same moment, I released his 
wrist, which I was still holding, and 
he drew. in his hand and looked 
sharply into the palm. 
“Ten o’clock!” he cried. “Six hours.. 60 
We'll do them yet”; and’ he sprang to 
his feet. 
Even as he did so, he reeled, put 
his hand to his throat, stood swaying 
for a moment, and then, with a 
peculiar sound, fell from his whole 
height face foremost to the floor. 
I ran to him at once} calling to 
my mother. But haste was all in 
vain. The captain had been struck 70 
dead by thundering apoplexy. It is 
a curious thing to understand, for I 
had certainly never liked the man, 
though of late I Had begun to pity 
him, but as soon as I saw that he was 
dead, I burst into a flood of tears. It 
was the second death I had known, and 
the sorrow of the first was still fresh 
in my heart. 
CHAPTER IV

I lost no time, of course, in telling so 
my mother all that I knew, and per- 
haps should have told her long before, 
and we saw ourselves at once in a 
difficult and dangerous'‘positicn. Some 
of the man’s money—if he had any— 
was certainly due to us; but it was 
not likely that our captain’s ship-

96° THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
Livesey would have left my mother 
alone and unprotected, which was 
not to be thought of. Indeed, it 
seemed impossible for either of us to 
remain much longer in the house; 
the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, 
the very ticking of the clock, filled 
us with alarms. The neighborhood, 
to our ears, seemed haunted by ap- 
10 proaching footsteps; and what be- 
tween the dead body of the captain 
on the parlor floor, and the thought 
of that detestable blind beggar hover- 
ing near at hand, and ready to return, 
there were moments when, as the 
saying goes, I jumped in my skin for 
terror. Something must speedily be 
resolved upon; and it occtirred to us 
at last. to go forth together and seek 
_20 help in the neighboring hamlet. No 
sooner said than done. Bareheaded 
as Wwe were, we ran out at once in the - 
gathering evening and the frosty fog. 
The hamlet lay not many hundred 
yards away, though out of view, on 
the other side of the next cove; and 
what greatly encouraged me, it was 
in an opposite direction from that 
whence the blind man had made his 
30 appearance, and whither he had pre- 
sumably returned. We were not many 
minutes on the road, though we some- 
times stopped to lay hold of each other 
and: hearken. ‘But there was no un- 
usual sound—nothing but the low 
wash of the ripple and the croaking of 
the inmates of the wood. 
It was already candle-light when 
we reached ‘the hamlet, and I shall 
4o never forget how much I was cheered 
to see the yellow shine in doors and 
windows; but that, as it proved, was 
. the best‘of the help we were likely to 
get in that quarter. For—you would 
have thought men would have been 
ashamed of themselves—no soul would 
consent to return with us to the “Ad- 
miral Benbow.”. The more we told 
of our troubles, the more—man, woman, and child—they clung to the 
shelter of their houses. The name of 
Captain Flint, though it was strange 
to me, was well enough known to 
some there, and carried a great weight 
of terror. Some of the men who had 
been to field-work on the far side of 
the “Admiral Benbow” remembered, 
besides, to have seen several strangers 
on the road, and, taking them to be 
smugglers, to have bolted away; and 
one at least had seen a little lugger in 
what we called Kitt’s Hole. For that 
matter, anyone who was a comrade of 
the captain’s was enough to frighten 
them to death. And the short and 
the long of the matter was, that while 
we could get several who were willing 
enough to ride to Dr. Livesey’s, which 
Jay in another direction, not one 
would help us defend the inn. 
They say cowardice is infectious; 
but then argument is, on the other 
hand, a great emboldener; and so 
when each had said his say, my 
mother made them a speech. She 
would not, she declared, lose money 
that belonged to her fatherless boy; 
“if none of the rest of you dare,” she 
said, “Jim and I dare. Back we will 
go, the way we came, and small s 
thanks to you big, hulking, chicken- 
hearted men. We'll have that chest 
open, if we die for it. And I’ll thank 
you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to 
bring back our lawful money in.” 
Of course, I said I would go with 
my mother; and of course they all 
cried out at our foolhardiness; but 
even then not a man would go along 
with us. All they would do was to » 
give me a loaded pistol, lest we were 
attacked; and to promise to have 
horses ready saddled, in casé we were 
pursued on our return; while one lad 
was to ride forward to the doctor’s, 
in search of armed assistance. 
My heart was beating finely when 
we two set forth in the cold night
-P-A-G-E-106

upon this dangerous venture. A full 
moon was beginning to rise and 
peered redly through the upper edges 
of the fog, and this increased our 
haste, for it was plain, before we came 
forth again, that all would be as 
bright as day, and our departure ex- 
posed to the eyes of any watchers. 
We slipped along the hedges, noiseless 
and swift, nor did we see or hear any- 
thing to increase our terrors, till, to 
our relief, the door of the “Admiral 
Benbow” had closed behind us. 
I slipped the bolt at once, and we 
stood and panted for a moment in the 
dark, alone in the house with the dead 
captain’s body. Then my mother got 
a candle in the bar, and, holding each 
other’s hands, we advanced into the 
parlor. He lay as we had left him, 
on his back, with his eyes open, and 
one arm stretched out. 
“Draw down the 
whispered my mother; “they might 
come and watch outside. And now,” 
said she, when I had done so, “we 
have to get the key off that; and 
who’s to touch it, I should like to 
know!” and she gave a kind of sob 
as she said the words. 
I went down on my knees at once. 
On the floor close to his hand there 
was a little round of paper, blackened 
on the one side. I could not doubt 
that this was the black spot; and, 
taking it up, I found written on the 
other side, in a very good, clear hand, 
this short message: “You have till 
ten tonight.” 
“He had till ten, mother,” said I; 
and just as I said it, our old clock 
began striking. This sudden noise 
startled us shockingly; but the news 
was good, for it was only six. 
“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.” 
I felt in his pockets, one after an- 
other. A few small coins, a thimble, 
and some thread and big needles, a 
piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at blind, Jim,” 97 
the end, his: gully with the crooked 
handle, a pocket compass, and a 
tinder box, were all that they con- 
tained, and I began to despair. 
“Perhaps it’s round his neck,” sug- 
gested my mother. 
Overcoming a strong repugnance, I 
tore open his shirt at the neck, and 
there, sure enough, hanging to a bit 
of tarry string, which I cut with his 
own gully, we found the key. At 
this triumph we were filled with hope, 
and hurried upstairs, without delay, 
to the little room where le had slept 
so long, and where his box had stood 
since the day of his arrival. 
It was like any other seaman’s 
chest on the outside, the initial “B” 
burned on the top of it with a hot 
iron, and the corners somewhat 
smashed and broken as by long, rough 
usage. 
“Give me the key,” said my mother; 
and though the lock was very stiff, 
she had turned it and thrown back 
the lid in a twinkling. 
A strong smell of tobacco and tar 
rose from the interior, but nothing 
was to be seen on the top except a 
suit of very good clothes, carefully 
brushed and folded: They had never 
been worn, my mother said. Under 
that, the miscellany began—a quad- 
rant, a tin cannikin, several sticks of 50 
tobacco, two brace of very handsome . 
pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old 
Spanish watch, and some other trinkets 
of little value and mostly of foreign 
make, a pair of compasses mounted 
with brass, and five or six curious 
West Indian shells. I have often 
wondered since why he should have 
carried about these shells with him 
in his wandering, guilty, and hunted 
life. 
In the meantime, we had found 
nothing of any value but the silver 
and the trinkets, and neither of these

were in our way. Underneath there 
was an old boat-cloak, whitened with 
sea salt on many a harbor-bar. My 
mother pulled it up with impatience, 
and there lay before us the last things 
in the chest, a bundle tied up in oil- 
cloth, and looking like papers, and a 
canvas bag, that gave forth, at touch, 
the jingle of gold. 
to “J’ll show these rogues that I’m 
an honest woman,” said my mother. 
“Tl have my dues, and not a farthing 
over. Hold Mrs. Crossley’s bag.” 
And she began to count over the 
amount of the captain’s store from 
the sailor’s bag into the one that I 
' was holding. 
It was a long, difficult business, for 
the coins were of all countries and 
20 sizes—doubloons, and louis d’ors, and 
guineas, and pieces of eight, and I 
know not. what besides, all shaken 
together at random. The guineas, 
too, were about the scarcest, and it 
“was with these only that my mother 
knew how to make her count. 
‘When we were about halfway 
through, I suddenly put my hand 
upon her arm; for- I had heard in 
30 the silent, frosty air a sound that 
brought my heart into my mouth— 
the tap-tapping of the blind man’s 
stick upon the frozen road. It grew 
nearer and hearer, while we sat holding 
our breath. Then it struck sharp on 
the inn door, and then we could hear 
the handle being turned, and the 
bolt rattling as the wretched being 
tried to enter;. and then there was a 
40 long time of silence both within and 
without. At last the tapping re- 
commenced, and, to our indescribable 
joy and gratitude, died slowly away 
again until it ceased to be heard. 
“Mother,” said I, “take the whole 
and let’s be going”; for I was sure 
the bolted door must have seemed 
suspicious, and would bring the whole 
1, in our way, of interest or value to us. ‘forth into the moonlight. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
hornet’s nest about our ears, though 
how thankful I was that I had bolted 
it, none could tell who had never 
met that terrible blind man. 
But my mother, frightened as she 
was, would not consent to take a 
fraction more than was due to her, 
and was obstinately unwilling to be 
content with less. It was not yet 
seven, she said, by a long way; she 
knew her rights and she would have 
them; and she was still arguing with 
me, when a little low whistle sounded 
a good way off upon the hill. That 
was enough, and more than enough, 
for both of us. 
‘Tl take what I have,” 
jumping to her feet. 
“And I'll take this to square the 
count,” said I, picking up the oilskin 
packet. 
Next moment we were both groping 7 
downstairs, leaving the candle by 
the empty chest; and the next we 
had opened the door and were in full 
retreat. We had not started a mo- 
ment too soon. The fog was rapidly 
dispersing; already the moon shone 
quite clear on the high ground on 
either side; and it was only in the 
exact bottom of the dell and round the 
tavern door that a thin veil still hung « 
unbroken to conceal the first steps 
of our escape. Far less than halfway 
to the hamlet, very little beyond the 
bottom of the hill, we must come 
Nor was 
this all; for the sound of several 
footsteps running came already to 
our ears, and as we looked back in 
their direction, a light tossing to and 
fro and still rapidly advancing, showed & 
that one of the newcomers carried a 
lantern. 
“My dear,” said my mother sud- 
denly, “take the money and run on. | 
I am going to faint.” 
This was certainly the end for both 
of us, I thought. How I cursed the she said,

Ss 3 Ss - : TREASURE ISLAND 
cowardice of the neighbors; how I 
blamed my poor mother for her hon- 
esty and her greed, for her past fool- 
hardiness and present weakness! We 
were just at the little bridge, by good 
fortune; and I helped her, tottering 
as she was, to the edge of the bank, 
where, sure enough, she gave a sigh 
and fell on my shoulder. I do not 
know how I found the strength to do 
it at-all, and I am afraid it was 
roughly done; but I managed to 
drag her down the bank and a little 
way under the arch. Farther I could 
not move her, for the bridge was too 
low to let me do more than crawl 
below it. So there we had to stay— 
my mother almost entirely exposed, 
and both of us within earshot of the 
inn, 
CHAPTER V 
Tue Last or tHe Buinp Man 
' My curiosity, in a sense, was 
stronger than my fear; for I could not 
remain where I was, but crept back to 
the bank again, whence, sheltering my 
head behind a bush of broom, I might 
command the road before our door. 
Iwas scarcely in position ere my 
enemies began to arrive, seven or 
eight of them, running hard, their feet 
beating out of time along the road, and 
the man with the lantern some paces 
in front. Three men ran together, 
hand in hand; and I made out, even 
througli the mist, that the middle man 
of this trio was the blind beggar. The 
next moment his voice showed me that 
I was right. 
“Down with the door!” he cried. 
“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or 
three; and a rush was made upon the 
“Admiral Benbow,” the lantern-bearer 
following; and then I could see them 
pause, and hear speeches passed in a 
lower key, as if they were surprised to 
find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again 
issued his commands. His voice 
sounded louder and higher, as if he 
were afire with eagerness and rage. 
“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed 
them for their delay. 
Four or five of them obeyed at once, 
two remaining on the road with the 
formidable beggar. There was a 
pause, then a cry of surprise, and then 
a voice shouting from the house: 
“Bill’s dead!” 
But the blind man swore at them 
again for their delay. 
“Search him, some of you shirking 
lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and 
get the chest,” he cried. 
I could hear their feet rattling up 
our old stairs, so that the house must 
have shook with it. Promptly after- 
wards, fresh sounds of ‘astonishment 
arose; the window of the captain’s 
room was thrown open with a slam 
and a jingle of broken glass; and a 
man leaned out into the moonlight, 
head and shoulders, and addressed the 
blind beggar on the road below him. 
“Pew,” he cried, “théy’ve been be- 
fore us. ‘Someone’s turned the chest 
out alow and aloft.” 
“Ts it there?” roared Pew. 
“The money’s there.” 
The blind man cursed the money. 
“Flint’s fist, I mean,” he cried. 
“We don’t. see it here nohow,”’ re- 
turned the man. 
“Here, you below there, is it on 
Bill?” cried the blind man again. 
At that, another fellow, probably 
he who had remained below to search 
the captain’s body, came to the door 
of the inn. “Bill’s been overhauled 
a’ready,”’ said he, “nothin’s left.” 
“It’s these people of the inn—it’s 
that boy. I wish I had put his eyes 
out!” cried the blind man, Pew. 
“They were here no time ago-——they 
had the door bolted when I tried it. 
Scatter, lads, and find ’em.” 99° 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
100 
“Sure enough, they left their glim 
here,” said the fellow from the window. 
“Scatter and find ’em{ Rout the 
house out!” reiterated Pew, striking 
~ with his stick upon the road. 
Then there followed a great to-do 
through all our old inn, heavy feet 
pounding to and fro, furniture thrown 
over, doors kicked in, until the very 
10 rocks reéchoed, and the men came out 
again, one after another, on the road, 
and declared that we were nowhere to 
be found. And just then the same 
whistle that had alarmed my mother 
and myself over the dead captain’s 
money was once more clearly audible 
through the night, but this time twice 
repeated. I had thought it to be the 
blind man’s trumpet, so to speak, sum- 
20 moning his crew to the assault; but I 
now found that it was a signal from 
the hillside toward the hamlet, and, 
from its effect upon the- buccaneers, a 
signal to warn them of approaching 
danger. 
“There’s Dirk again,” . said one. 
“Twice! We'll have to budge, mates.” - 
“Budge, you skulk!’ cried Pew. 
“Dirk was a fool and a coward from 
30 the first—you wouldn’t mind him. 
They must be close by; they can’t be 
far; you have your hands on it. 
Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, 
shiver my soul,” he cried, “if I had 
eyes!” 
This appeal seemed to produce some 
effect, for two of the fellows began to 
look here and there among the lumber, 
but half-heartedly, I thought, and 
40 with half an eye to their own danger 
all the time, while the rest stood 
irresolute on the road. 
“You have your hands on thousands, 
you fools, and you hang a leg! You’d 
be as rich as kings if you could find it, 
and you know it’s here, and you stand 
there skulking. There wasn’t one of 
you dared face Bill, and I did it—a 
blind man! And I’m to lose my THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
chance for you! I’m to be a poor, 
crawling beggar, sponging for rum, 
when I might be rolling in a coach! 
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a 
biscuit you would catch them still.’ 
“Hang it, Pew, we’ve got the doub- 
loons!’ grumbled one. 
“They might have hid the blessed 
thing,” said another. 
“Take the Georges, Pew, and don’t 
stand here squalling.” 
Squalling was the word for it, Pew’s 
anger rose so high at these objections; 
till at last, his passion completely 
taking the upper hand, he struck at 
them right and left in his blindness, 
and his stick sounded heavily on more 
than one. 
These, in their turn, cursed back at 
the blind miscreant, threatened him in 
horrid terms, and tried in vain to1 
eatch the stick and wrest it from his 
grasp. 
This quarrel was the saving of us; 
for while it was still raging, another 
sound came from the top of the hill 
on the side of the hamlet—the tramp 
of horses galloping. Almost at the 
same time a pistol-shot, flash and 
report, came from the hedge side. 
And that was plainly the last signal « 
of danger, for the buccaneers turned 
at once and ran, separating in every 
direction, one seaward toward the 
cove, one slant across the hill, and so 
on, so that in half a minute not a sign 
of them remained but Pew. Him 
they had deserted, whether in sheer 
panic or out of revenge for his ill 
words and blows, I know not; but 
there he remained behind, tapping up % 
and down the road in a frenzy, and 
groping and calling for his comrades. 
Finally he took the wrong turn, and 
ran a few steps past me, toward the 
hamlet, crying: 
“Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,” and 
59. Georges, guineas (named from the figure of St. 
George).
-P-A-G-E-110
TREASURE ISLAND 
other names, “you won’t: leave old 
Pew, mates—not old Pew!” 
Just then the noise of horses topped 
the rise, and four or five riders came 
in sight in the moonlight, and swept 
at full gallop down the slope. 
At this Pew saw his error, turned 
with a scream, and ran straight for the 
ditch, into which he rolled. But he 
was on his feet again in a second, and 
made another dash, now utterly be- 
wildered, right under the nearest of 
the coming horses. 
The rider tried to.save him, but in 
vain. Down went Pew with a cry 
that rang high into the night; and the 
four hoofs trampled and spurned him 
and passed by. He fell on his side, 
then gently collapsed upon his face, 
and moved no more. 
I leaped to my feet and hailed the 
riders. They were pulling up, at any 
rate, horrified at the accident; and I 
soon. saw what they were. One, tail- 
ing out behind the rest, was a lad that 
had gone from the hamlet to Dr. 
Livesey’s; the rest were revenue 
officers, whom he had met by the 
way, and with whom he had had the 
intelligence to return at once. Some 
news of the lugger in Kitt’s Hole had 
found its way to Supervisor Dance and 
set him forth that night in our direc- 
tion, and to that circumstance my 
mother and I owed our preservation 
from death. 
Pew was dead, stone dead. As for 
my mother, when we had carried her 
up tothe hamlet, a little cold water 
and salts and that soon brought her 
back ‘again, and she was none the 
worse for her terror, though she still 
continued to deplore the balance of 
the mosiey. In the meantime, the 
supervisor rode on, as fast as he 
could, to Kitt’s Hole; but his men 
had to dismount and grope down the 
dingle, leading, and sometimes sup- 
porting, their horses, and in continual 101 
fear of ambushes; so it was no great 
matter for surprise that when they got 
down to the Hole, the lugger was 
already under way, though still close 
in. He hailed her. A voice replied, 
telling him to keep out of the moon- 
light, or he would get some lead in 
him, and at the same time a bullet 
whistled close by his arm. Soon after, 
the lugger doubled the point. and dis- 
appeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as 
he said, “like a fish out of water,” 
and all he could do was to dispatch 
a man to B—— to warn the cutter. 
“And that,” said he, “is just about as 
good as nothing. They’ve got off 
clean, and there’s an end. Only,” he 
added, “I’m glad I trod on Master 
Pew’s corns’’; for by this time he had 
heard my story. 
I went back with him to the “Ad- 
miral Benbow,” and you cannot 
imagine a house in such a state of 
smash; the very clock had been thrown 
down by these fellows in their furious 
hunt after my mother and myself; 
and though nothing had actually been 
taken away except the captain’s 
money-bag and a little silver from the 
till, I could see at once that we were 
ruined. Mr. Dance could make noth- 
ing of the scene. : 
“They got the money, you say? 
Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune 
were they after? More money, I 
suppose?” 
“No, sir; not money, I think,” re- 
plied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I have 
the thing in my breast-pocket; and, 
to tell you the truth, I should like to 
get it put in safety.” 
“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said 
he. “T’'ll take it, if you like.” 
“T thought, perhaps, Dr. Livesey —” 
I began. 
“Perfectly right,” he interrupted, 
very cheerily, “perfectly right—a gen- 
tleman and a magistrate. And, now 
I come to think of it, I might as well 80

ride round there myself and report to 
him or squire. Master Pew’s dead, 
when all’s done; not that I regret it, 
but he’s dead, you see, and people 
will make it out against an officer of 
his Majesty’s revenue, if make it out 
they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins: 
if you like, I’ll take you along.” 
J thanked him heartily for the offer, 
10 and we walked back to the hamlet, 
where the horses were. By the time 
I had told mother of my purpose they 
were all in the saddle. 
“‘Dogger,”” said Mr. Dance, “you 
~ have a good horse; take up this lad 
~ behind you.” 
As soon as I was mounted, holding 
on to Dogger’s belt, the supervisor 
gave the word, and the party struck 
20 out at a bouncing trot on the road to 
Dr. Livesey’s house. 
CHAPTER VI 
Tue Captain’s Papers 
We rode hard all the way, till we 
drew up before Dr. Livesey’s door. 
The house was all dark to the front. 
Mr. Dance told me to jump down 
and knock, and Dogger gave me a 
stirrup to descend by. The door was 
opened almost at once by the maid. 
“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked. 
30 No, she said;.he had come home in 
the afternoon, but had gone up to the 
Hall to dine and pass .the evening 
with the squire. 
“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. 
Dance. 
This time, as the distance was short, 
I did not mount, but ran with Dogger’s 
stirrup-leather to the lodge gates, and 
up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue 
4o to, where the white line of the Hall 
‘buildings looked on: either hand on 
great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance 
dismounted, and, taking me along 
with him, was admitted ata a word i into 
thé house. The servant Jed us down a matted 
passage, and showed us at the end into 
a great library, all lined with book- 
cases, and busts upon the top of them, 
where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, 
pipe in hand, on either side of a bright 
fire. 
I had never seen the squire so near 
at hand. He was a tall man, over six 
feet high, and broad in proportion, 
and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready 
face, all roughened and reddened and 
lined in his long travels. His eye- 
brows were very black, and moved 
readily, and this gave him a look of 
some temper, not bad, you would say, 
but quick and high. 
“Come in, Mr. Dance,” said he, 
very stately and condescending. 
“Good-evening, Dance,” says the 
doctor, with a nod. “And good-eve- 
ning to you, friend Jim. What good 
wind brings you here?” 
The supervisor stood up straight 
and stiff, and told his story like a 
lesson; and you should have seen 
how the two gentlemen leaned for- 
ward and looked at each other, and 
forgot to smoke in their surprise and 
interest. When they heard how my 
mother went back to the inn, Dr. 
Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and 
the squire cried “Bravo!” and broke 
his long pipe against the grate. Long 
before it was done, Mr. Trelawney 
(that, you will remember, was the 
squire’s name) had got up from his 
seat, and was striding about the room, 
and the doctor, as if to hear the 
better, had taken off his powdered 
wig, and sat there, looking very 
strange indeed with his own close- 
cropped, black poll. 
At last Mr. Dance finished the story. 
“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you | 
are a very noble fellow. And as for 
riding down that black, atrocious mis- 
creant, I regard it as an act of virtue, 
sir, like stamping on a cockroach.
-P-A-G-E-112
TREASURE ISLAND 
This Jad Hawkins is a trump, I per- 
ceive. Hawkins, will you ring that 
bell? Mr. Dance must have some ale.” 
“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, 
“you have the thing that they were 
after, have you?” . 
“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave 
him the oilskin packet. 
The doctor looked it all over, as if 
his fingers were itching to open it; 
but, instead of doing that, he put it 
quietly in the pocket of his coat. 
“Squire,” said he, “when Dance 
has had his ale he must, of course, be 
off on his Majesty’s service; but I 
mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to 
sleep at my house, and, with your 
permission, I propose we should have 
up the cold pie, and let him sup.” 
“As you will, Livesey,” said the 
squire; “Hawkins has earned better 
than cold pie.” 
So a big pigeon pie was brought in 
and put on a side-table, and I made a 
hearty supper, for I was as hungry as 
a hawk, while Mr. Dance was further 
complimented, and at last dismissed. 
“And now, squire,” said the doctor. 
“And now, Livesey,” said the squire, 
‘in the same breath. 
“One at a time, one at a time,” 
laughed Dr. Livesey. “You have 
heard of this Flint, I suppose?” 
“Heard of him!” cried the squire. 
“Heard of hint, you say! He was the 
bloodthirsfiest buccaneer that sailed. 
Blackbeard was a child: to Flint. 
The Spaniards were so prodigiously 
afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I 
was sometimes proud he was an 
Englishman. I’ve seen his topsails 
with these eyes off Trinidad, and the 
cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that 
I sailed with put back—put back, sir, 
into Port of Spain.” 
“Well, I’ve heard of him myself, in 
England,” said the doctor. “But the 
point is, had he money?” 
“Money!” cried the squire. “Have 103 
you heard the story? What were 
these villains after but money? What 
do they care for but money? For 
what would they risk their rascal 
carcasses but money?” . 
“That we shall soon know,” re- 
plied the doctor. “But you are so 
confoundedly hot-headed and exclama- 
tory that I cannot get a word in. 
What I want to know is this: Suppos- 
ing that I have here in' my pocket 
some clue to ‘where Flint buried his 
treasure, will that treasure amount 
to much?” 
“Amount, sir!’ cried the squire. 
“Tt will amount to this: if we have the 
clue you talk about, I fit out a ship 
in Bristol dock, and take you and 
Hawkins here along, and I'll have 
that treasure if I search a year.” 
“Very well,” said the doctor. “Now, 
then, if Jim is agreeable, we’ll open 
the packet’; and he laid it before 
him on the table. 
The bundle was sewn together, and 
the doctor had to get out his instru- 
ment-case, and cut the stitches with 
his medical scissors.. It contained two 
things—a book and a sealed paper. 
“First of all we'll try the book,” 
observed. the doctor. 
The squire and I were both peering 
over his shoulder as he opened it, for 50 
80 
Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me ~ 
to come‘round from the side-table, 
where I had been eating, to enjoy 
the sport of the search. On the first 
page there were only some scraps of 
writing, such as a man with a pen in 
his hand might make for idleness or 
practice. One was the same as the 
tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; 
then there was “Mr. W. Bones, mate.” 
“No more’rum.” “Off Palm Key he 
got itt’; and some other snatches, 
mostly single words and unintelligible. 
I could not help wondering who it 
91! Bitty Bones his, an old mistaken way of writing the possessive, Bones’s.
-P-A-G-E-113
104 
was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” 
was that he got. A knife in his back 
as like as not. 
“Not much instruction there,” said 
Dr. Livesey, as he passed on. 
The next ten or twelve pages were 
filled with a curious series of entries. 
There was a date at one end of the 
line, and at the other a sum of money, 
10 as in common account-books, but in- 
stead of explanatory writing, only a 
varying number of crosses between 
the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, 
for instance, a sum of seventy pounds 
had plainly become due to someone, 
and there was nothing but six crosses 
to explain the cause. In a few cases, 
to be sure, the name of a place would 
be added, as ‘‘Offe Caraccas”; or a 
20 mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62° 17’ 20”, 19° Q' 40”. ” 
The record lasted over nearly twenty 
years, the amount of the separate 
entries growing larger as time went 
on, and at the end a grand total had 
been made out after five or six wrong 
additions, and these words appended, 
“Bones, his pile.” 
“T can’t make head or tail of this,” 
, 30 said Dr. Livesey. 
“The thing is as clear as noonday,” 
cried the squire. “This is the black- 
hearted hound’s account book. These 
crosses stand for the names of ships 
or towns that they sank or plundered. 
The sums are the scoundrel’s share, 
and where he feared an ambiguity 
you see he added something clearer. 
‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here 
40 was some unhappy vessel: boarded off 
that coast. God help the poor souls 
that manned her—coral long ago.” 
“Right!” said the doctor. “See 
what it is to be a traveler. Right! 
And the amounts increase, you see, as 
he rose in rank.” 
There was little else in the volume 
but a few bearings of places noted in 
the blank leaves toward the end, and THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
a table for reducing French, English, 5 
and Spanish moneys to a common 
value. 
“Thrifty man!” cried the doctor. 
“He wasn’t the one to be cheated.” 
“And now,” said the squire, “for 
the other.” / 
The paper had been sealed in 
several places with a thimble by way 
.of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that 
I had found in the captain’s pocket. 6 
The doctor opened the seals with 
great care, and there fell out the 
map of an island, with latitude and 
longitude, soundings, names of hills, 
and bays and inlets, and every par- 
ticular that would be needed to bring 
a ship to a safe anchorage upon its 
shores. It was about nine miles long 
and five across, shaped, you might 
say, like a fat dragon standing up, 7 
and had two fine land-locked harbors, 
and a hill in the center part marked 
“The Spyglass.” There were several 
additions of a later date; but, above 
all, three crosses of red ink—two on 
the north part of the island, one on 
the southwest, and, besides this last, 
in the same red ink, and in a small, 
neat hand, very different from the 
captain’s tottery characters, these s0 
words: “Bulk of treasure here.” 
Over on the back the same hand 
had written this further information: 
Tall tree, Spyglass shoulder, bearing a 
point to the N. of N.N.E. * 
Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. 
Ten feet.

hummock, ten fathoms south of the black 9¢ 
crag with the face on it. 
‘The arms are easy found, in the sand 
hill, N. point of north inlet cape bearing 
E. and a quarter N. LF 
That was all; but brief as it was, 
and, to me, incomprehensible, it filled 
the squire and Dr. Livesey with de- 
light.

“Livesey,” said the squire, “you 
will give up this wretched practice at 
once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. 
In three weeks’ time—three weeks !— 
two weeks—ten days—we’ll have the 
best ship, sir, and the choicest crew 
in England. Hawkins shall come as 
cabin-boy. You'll make a famous 
cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, 
are ship’s doctor; Iam admiral. We'll 
take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. 
We'll have favorable winds, a quick 
passage, and not the least difficulty in 
finding the spot, and money to eat— 
to roll into play duck and drake 
with ever after.” 
“Trelawney,”’ said the doctor, “I'll 
go with you; and, I'll go bail for it, 
so will Jim, and be a credit to the 
undertaking. There’s only one man 
Tm afraid of.” 105 
“And who’s that?” cried the squire. 
“Name the dog, sir!” 
“You,” replied the doctor; “for you 
cannot hold your tongue. We are 
not the only men who know of this 
paper. These fellows who attacked 
the inn tonight—bold, desperate 
blades, for sure—and the rest who 
stayed aboard that lugger, and more, 
I dare say, not far off, are, one and 
all, through thick and thin, bound 
that they’ll get that money. We must 
none.of us go alone till we get to sea. 
Jim and I shall stick together in the 
meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and 
Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and, 
from first to last, not one of us must 
breathe a word of what we've found.” 
“Livesey,” returned the squire, “you 
are always in the right of it. I'll be 
as silent as the grave.” 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expnanatory Notes 
1, In his essay “My First Book—Treasure 
Island’ Stevenson tells in an intimate fashion 
the circumstances under which the book was 
written. While it was not literally his first 
book, be calls it such because it was his first 
long story to find favor with “his paymaster,” 
the public. With gentle humor Stevenson 
confides in the reader that he wrote the book 
with much pleasure and satisfaction for, he 
says, “stolen waters are proverbially sweet.” 
He acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the 
author of Robinson Crusoe for the parrot and 
to Poe for the skeleton. “These useful writers,” 
he ‘says, “had fulfilled the poet’s saying: de- 
parting they had left behind them 
‘Footprints on the sands of time; 
Footprints that perhaps another’— 
and I was the other!” However, his debt to 
Washington Irving, he owns, really troubled 
his conscience a bit, as he traced the origin of 
Billy Bones and his chest, the company in the 
parlor, and in fact much of the detail of the 
first chapters, to his eatlier reading of the 
Tales of a Traveler, though at the time of 
writing he was not conscious of the source of 
il 2. In his essay “A Gossip on Romance,” in 
Memories and Portraits, the author himself 
gives the best hint on how to read the story. 
“We should gloat over a book, be rapt clean 
out of ourselves, and rise from the perusal, our 
minds filled with the busiest, kaleidoscopic dance 
of images, incapable of sleep or of continuous’ 
thought. The words, if the book be eloquent, 
should run thenceforward in our ears like the 
noise of breakers, and the story, if it be a story, 
repeat itself in a thousand colored pictures to 
the eye.” 
Questions and Topics. 
1. Stevenson dedicated Treasure Island to 
his thirteen-year-old stepson, Lloyd Osbourne; 
the boy’s enthusiasm for the story was a great 
inspiration to the author. In a letter to a 
friend Stevenson writes, “No women in the 
story, Lloyd’s orders”; how was this order 
carried out? Is Jim or his mother the heroic 
character in Chapter IV? 
2. Notice how the story gains realism by 
being told in the first person. Where did you 
first learn Jim Hawkins’s name? Remember- 
ing clearly his own boyhood and that boys 
like to imagine themselves the heroes about 
whom they read, Stevenson does not describe 30
-P-A-G-E-115
106 © 
Jim Hawkins definitely; does this help the 
reader to imagine himself to be the hero? 
8. Note the extreme contrast between the 
old sea dog and Dr. Livesey. How did the 
doctor happen to call the old sea captain - 
“Mr. Bones”? 
4. Treasure Island has been produced as a 
motion picture; but the story is so full of action 
and so vividly told that if one has not seen 
it in scenario form he will have no difficulty 
in imagining an adaptation for himself. If THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
you were writing a scenario for this story, 
what incidents would you relate for the follow- 
ing scenes: At the “Admiral Benbow”; At the 
bridge; At the Hall? Which scene would be 
particularly effective? Select paragraphs that 
would be especially useful in telling how the 
characters of Billy Bones, Black Dog, and 
the blind beggar Pew should appear on the 
screen,

PART I 
THE SEA COOK 
CHAPTER VII 
I Go ro Bristou 
It was longer than the squire 
imagined ere we were ready for the 
sea, and none of our first plans—not 
even Dr. Livesey’s of keeping me 
beside him—could be carried out as 
we intended. The doctor had to go 
to London for a physician to take 
charge of his practice; the squire was 
hard at work at Bristol; and I lived 
10 on at the Hall under the charge of 
old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost 
a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and 
' the most charming anticipations of 
strange islands and adventures. I 
brooded by the hour together over 
the map, all the details of which I 
well remembered. Sitting by the fire 
in ‘the housekeeper’s room, I ap- 
proached that island in my fancy, 
20 from every possible direction; I ex- 
plored every acre of its surface; I 
climbed a thousand times to that tall 
hill they call the Spyglass, and from 
the top enjoyed the most. wonderful 
and changing prospects. Sometimes 
the isle was thick with savages, with 
whom we fought; sometimes full of 
dangerous animals that hunted us; 
but in all my fancies nothing occurred 
30 to me so strange and tragic as our 
actual adventures. So the weeks passed on, till one 
fine day there came a letter addressed 
to Dr. Livesey. with this addition, 
“To be opened, ‘in the case of his 
absence, by Tom Redruth or young 
Hawkins.” Obeying this order, we 
found, or rather, I found—for the 
gamekeeper was a poor hand at read- 
ing anything but print—the following 
important news: ~ 
Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17— 
Dear Livesey—As I do not know 
whether you are at the Hall or still in 
London, I send this in double to both 
places. 
The ship is bought and fitted. She 
lies at anchor, ready for sea.- You never 
imagined a sweeter schooner—a child 
might sail her—two hundred tons; name, 
Hispaniola. 
I got her through my old friend, 
Blandly, who has proved himself through. 
out the most surprising trump. The ad- 
mirable fellow literally slaved in my in- 
terest, and so, I may say, did everyone 
in Bristol, as sodn as they got wind of the 
port we sailed for—treasure, I mean. 
“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the 
letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like that. 
The squire has been talking, after all.’ 
“Well, who’s a better right?” 
growled the gamekeeper. “A pretty 
rum go if squire. ain’t to talk for Dr. 
Livesey, I should think.’ 
At that I gave up all attempt at 
commentary, and read straight on:
-P-A-G-E-116
TREASURE ISLAND 
Blandly himself found the Hispaniola, 
and by the most admirable management 
got her for the merest trifle. There is a 
class of men in_ Bristol monstrously 
prejudiced against Blandly. They go the 
length of declaring that this honest creature 
would do anything for money, that the 
Hispaniola belonged to him, and that he 
sold it me absurdly high—the most trans- 
10 parent calumnies. None of them dare, 
however, to deny the merits of the ship. 
So far there was not a hitch. The 
workpeople, to be sure—riggers and what 
not—were most annoyingly slow; but 
time cured that. It was the crew that 
troubled me. 
I wished a round score of men—in 
case of natives, buccaneers, or the odious 
French—and I had the worry of the deuce 
20 itself to find so much as half a dozen, till 
the most remarkable stroke of fortune 
brought me the very man that I required. 
I was standing on the dock, when, by 
the merest accident, I fell in talk with him. 
I found he was an old sailor, kept a public- 
house, ‘knew all the seafaring men in 
Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and 
wanted a ‘good berth as cook to get to 
sea again. He had hobbled down there 
that morning, he said, to get a smell of 
the salt. 
I was monstrously touched—so would 
you have been—and, out of pure pity, s 
I engaged him on the spot to be ship’s’ 
cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and 
has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a 
recommendation, since he lost it in his 
country’s services, under the immortal 
Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. 
Imagine the abominable age we live in! 
‘Well, sir, I thought I had only found a 
cook, but it was a crew I had discovered. 
Between Silver and myself we got together 
in a few days a company of the toughest 
old salts imaginable—not pretty to look 
at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most 
indomitable spirit. I declare we could 
fighta frigate. . 
Long John even got rid of two out of 
the six or seven I had already engaged. 
He showed me in a moment that they were 
just the sort of fresh water swabs we had 
to fear in an adventure of importance. 
I am in the most magnificent health 
and spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like 
a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till 
I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round 
the capstan. Seaward ho! Hang the 
treasure! It’s the glory of the sea that 
© has turned my head. So now, Livesey, 
. ° ° 107 
come post; do not lose an hour if you 
respect me. 
Let young Hawkins go at once to see 
his mother, with Redruth for a guard; 
and then both come full speed to Bristol. 
JouN TRELAWNEY 
Postscript—I did not tell you that 
Blandly, who, by the way, is to send a 
consort after us if we don’t turn up by the 
end of August, had found an admirable 
fellow for sailing master—a stiff man, 
which I regret, but, in all other respects, 
a treasure. Long John Silver unearthed 
a very competent man for a mate, a man 
named Arrow. I have a boatswain who 
pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-of- 
war fashion on board the good ship 
Hispaniola. 
I forgot to tell you that Silver is a 
man of substance; I know of my own 
knowledge that he has a banker’s account, 
which has never been overdrawn. He 
leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as 
she is & woman of color, a pair of old 
bachelors like you and I may be excused for 
guessing that it is the wife, quite as much 
as the health, that sends him back to 
roving. J.T. 
P.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night 
with his mother. J.T. 
You can fancy the excitement into 
which that letter put me. I was half 
‘beside myself with glee; and if ever 
I despised a man, it was old Tom Red- 
ruth, who could do nothing but 
grumble and lament. Any of the 
under-gamekeepers would gladly have 
changed places with him; but such 
was not the squire’s pleasure, and the 
squire’s pleasure was like law among 100 
them all. Nobody but old Redruth 
would have dared so much as even 
to grumble. : 
The next morning he and I set out 
on foot for the “Admiral Benbow,” 
and there I found my mother in good 
health and spirits.. The captain, who 
had so‘ long been a cause of so much 
discomfort, was gone where the wicked 
cease from troubling. The squire had 110

public rooms and the sign repainted, 
and had added some furniture—above 70

all a beautiful armchair for mother in 
the bar. He had found her a boy as 
an apprentice also, so that she should 
not. want help while I was gone. 
It was on seeing that boy that I 
understood, for the first time, my 
situation. I had thought up to that 
moment of the’ adventures before me, 
not at all of the home that I was leav- 
ing; and now, at sight of this clumsy 
stranger, who was to stay here in my 
place beside my mother, I had my 
first attack of tears. I am afraid I 
led that boy a dog’s life; for as he was 
new to the work, I had a hundred 
opportunities of setting him right and 
putting him down, and I was not slow 
to profit by them. 
The night passed, and the next day, 
after dinner, Redruth and I were 
afoot again, and on the road. I said 
good-by to mother and the cove 
where I had lived since I was born, 
and the dear old “Admiral Benbow” 
—since he was repainted, no longer 
quite so dear. One of my last thoughts 
was of the captain, who had so often 
strode along the beach with his cocked 
hat, his saber-cut cheek, and his old 
brass telescope. Next moment we 
had turned the corner, and my home 
was out of sight. 
The mail picked us up about dusk 
at the “Royal George” on the heath. 
I was wedged in between Redruth and 
a stout old gentleman, and in spite of 
the swift motion and the cold night 
air, I must have dozed a great deal 
from the very first, and then slept 
like a log up hill and down dale 
through stage after stage; for when I 
was awakened, at last, it was by a 
punch in the ribs, and I opened my 
eyes, to find that we were standing 
still before a large building in a city 
street, and that the day had already 
broken a long time. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“Where are we?” I asked. 
“Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.”’ 
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his 
residence at an inn far down the 
docks, to superintend the work upon 
the schooner. Thither we had now to 
walk, and our way, to my great de- 
light lay along the quays and beside 
the great multitude of ships of all 
sizes and rigs and nations. In one, 
sailors were singing at their work; in 
another, there were men aloft, high 
over my head, hanging to threads that. 
seemed no thicker than a ‘spider’s. 
Though I had lived by: the shore all 
my life, I seemed never to have been 
near the sea till then. The smell of 
the tar and salt was something new. 
I saw the most wonderful figureheads, 
that had been far over the ocean. I 
saw, besides, many old sailors, with 
rings in their ears, and whiskers 
curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, 
and their swaggering, clumsy sea- 
walk; and if I had seen as many kings 
or archbishops I could not have been 
more delighted. 
And I was going to sea myself; to 
sea in a schooner, with a piping boat- 
swain, and pigtailed, singing seamen; 
to sea bound for an unknown island, 
and to seek for buried treasures! 
While I was still in this delightful 
dream, we came suddenly in front of 
a large inn, and met Squire Trelawney, 
all dressed out like a sea-officer, in 
stout blue cloth, coming out of the 
door with a smile on his face, and a 
capital imitation of a sailor’s. walk. 
“Here you are,” he cried, “and the 
doctor came last night from London. 
Bravo! The ship’s company com- 
plete!” : 
“Oh, sir,” cried I, “when do we 
sail?” 
“Sail!” says he. “We sail to- 
morrow!”

CHAPTER VIIT 
At Tue SIGN oF THE “SpyeLass” 
When I had done breakfasting, the 
squire gave me a note addressed to 
John Silver, at the sign of the “Spy- 
glass,” and told me I should easily 
find the place by following the line 
of the docks, and keeping a bright 
lookout for a little tavern with a large 
brass telescope for sign. I set off, 
overjoyed at this opportunity to see 
more of the ships and seamen, and 
picked my way among a great crowd 
of people and carts and bales, for the 
dock was now at its busiest, until I 
found the tavern in question. 
It was a bright enough little place 
of entertainment. The sign was newly 
painted; the windows had neat red 
curtains; the floor was cleanly sanded. 
There was a street on either side, and 
an open door on both, which made 
the large, low room pretty clear to 
see in, in spite of clouds of tobacco 
smoke. 
The customers were mostly seafar- 
ing men; and they talked so loudly 
that I hung at the door, almost afraid 
to enter. 
As I was waiting, a man came out 
of a side room, and, at a glance, I 
was sure he must be Long John. His 
left leg was cut off close by the hip, 
and under the left shoulder he carried 
a crutch, which he managed with 
wonderful dexterity, hopping about 
upon it like a bird. He was very tall 
and strong, with a face as big as a 
ham—plain and pale, but intelligent 
and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in 
the most cheerful spirits, whistling 
as he moved about among the tables, 
with a merry word or a slap on the 
shoulder for the more favored of his 
guests. 
Now, to tell you the truth, from 
the very first mention of Long John 
in Squire Trelawney’s letter, I had 109 
taken a fear in my mind that he might+ 
prove to be the very one-legged sailor 
whom I had watched for so long at 
the old “Benbow.” But one look at 
the man before me was enough. I 
had seen the captain, and Black Dog, 
and the blind man Pew, and I thought 
I knew what a buccaneer was like—a 
very different creature, according to 
me, from this clean and_pleasant- 
tempered landlord. 
I plucked up courage ‘at once, 
crossed the threshold, and walked 
right up to the man where he stood, 
propped on his crutch, talking to a 
customer. . 
“Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding 
out the note. 
“Yes, my lad,”’ said he; “‘such is my 
‘name, to be sure. And who may you 
ber” And then as he saw the squire’s 
letter, he seemed to me to give some- 
thing almost like a start. 
“Oh!” said he, quite loud, and 
offering his hand, “I see. You are 
our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to 
see you.” , 
And he took my hand in his large, 
firm grasp. 
Just then one of the customers at 
the far side rose suddenly and made 
for the door. It was close by him, 
and he was out in the street in a 
moment. But his hurry had attracted 
my notice and I recognized him at a 
glance. It was the tallow-faced man, 
wanting two fingers, who had come 
first to the “Admiral Benbow.” 
“Oh,” I cried, “stop him! it’s 
Black Dog!’ ” 
“J don’t care two coppers who he 
is,’ cried Silver. “But he hasn’t 
paid his score. Harry, run and catch 
him.” : 
One of the others who was nearest 
the door leaped up, and started in 
pursuit. 
“Tf he were Admiral Hawke he 
shall pay his score,” cried Silver; and 80

then, relinquishing my hand—‘‘Who 
did you say he was?” he asked. 
“Black what?” 
“Dog, sir,” said I. “Has Mr. 
Trelawney not told you of the buc- 
caneers? He was one of them.” 
“Sof” cried Silver. “In my house! 
Ben, run and help Harry. One of 
- those swabs, was he? Was that you 
ishly, rolling his quid. drinking with him, Morgan? Step 
up here.” 
The man whom he called Morgan— 
an old, gray-haired, mahogany-faced 
sailor—came forward pretty sheep- 
“Now, Morgan,” said Long John, 
very sternly, “you never clapped your 
eyes on that Black—Black Dog be- 
fore, did you, now?” 
“Not I, sir,” said Morgan, with a 
salute, 
“You didn’t. know his name, did 
you?” 
“No, sir.” 
“By the powers, Tom Morgan, it’s 
as good for you!” exclaimed the land- 
lord. “If you had been mixed up 
with the like of that, you would 
never have put another foot in my 
house, you may lay to that. And 
what was he saying to you?” 
“T don’t rightly know, sir,” 
swered Morgan. 
“Do you call that a head on your 
shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?” 
cried Long John. “Don’t rightly 
know, don’t you! 
happen to rightly know who you was 
speaking to, perhaps? Come now, 
what was he jawing—v’yages, cap’ns, 
ships? Pipe up! What was it?” 
“We was a-talking of keel-haul- 
ing,” answered Morgan. 
“Keel-hauling, was you? And a 
mighty: suitable thing, too, and you 
may lay to that. Get back to your 
place for a lubber, Tom.” an-

thet keel with ropes. . judge or a Bow Street runner. 
Perhaps you don’t’ THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
And then, as Morgan rolled back 
to his seat, Silver added to me in a 
confidential whisper, that was very 
flattering, as I thought: 
“He’s quite an honest man, Tom 
Morgan, on’y stupid. And now,” 
he ran on again, aloud, “let’s see— 
Black Dog? No, I don’t know the 
name, not I. Yet I kind of think 
I’ve—yes, I’ve seen the swab.’ He 
used to come here with a blind beggar, 
he used.” 
“That he did, you may be sure,” 
said J, “I knew that blind man, too. 
His name was Pew.” 
“Jt was!” cried Silver, now quite 
excited. “Pew! That were his name 
for certain. Ah, he looked a shark, 
he did! If we run down this Black 
Dog, now, there'll be news for Cap’n 
Trelawney! Ben’s a good runner; 
few seamen run better than Ben. He 
should run him down, hand over hand, 
by the powers! He talked o’ keel- 
hauling, did he? I’1 keel-haul him!’ 
All the time he was jerking out 
these phrases he was stumping up 
and down the tavern on his crutch, 50 a 0

My suspicions had been thoroughly re- 
awakened on finding Black Dog at the 
“Spyglass,” and I watched the cook 
narrowly. But he was too deep, and 
too ready, and too clever for me, and 
by the time the two men had come 
back out of breath, and confessed 
that they had lost the track in a 
crowd, and been scolded like thieves, 
I would have gone bail for the inno- 
cence of Long John Silver.

Cap’n Trelawney—what’s he to think? 
Here I have this confounded son of a 
Dutchman sitting in my own house, 
drinking of my own rum! Here you 
comes and tells me of it plain; and 
here I let him give us all the slip 
before my blessed dead-lights! Now, 
Hawkins, you do me justice with the 
cap’n. You’re a lad, you are, but 
you’re as smart as paint. I see that 
when you first came in. Now, here 
it is: What could I do, with this old 
timber I hobble on? When I was an 
A B master mariner I’d have come 
up alongside of him, hand over hand, 
and broached him to in a brace of old 
shakes, I would; but now—” 
And then, all of a sudden, he 
stopped, and his jaw dropped as 
though he had remembered some- 
thing. 
“The score,” he burst out. “Three 
goes o’ rum! Why, shiver my tim- 
bers, if I hadn’t forgotten my score!” 
And, falling on a bench, he laughed 
until the tears ran down his cheeks. 
I could not help joining; and we 
laughed together, peal after peal, 
until the tavern rang again. 
“Why, what a precious old sea- 
calf I am!” he said, at last wiping 
his cheeks. ‘You and me should get 
on well, Hawkins, for I'll take my 
davy I should be rated ship’s boy. 
But, come now, stand by to go about. 
This won't do. Dooty is dooty, 
messmates. Ill put on my old cocked 
hat and step along of you to Cap’n 
Trelawney, and report this here affair. 
For, mind you, it’s serious, young 
Hawkins; and neither you nor me’s 
come out of it with what I should 
make so bold as to call credit. Nor 
you neither, says you; not smart— 
none of the pair of us smart. But 
dash my buttons! that was a good 
*un about my score.” 
And he began to laugh again, and 
14, AB, able-bodied seaman. 34. davy, affidavit. 111 
that so heartily that, though I did not 
see the joke as he did, I was again 
obliged to join him in his mirth. 
On our little walk along the quays, 
he made himself the most interesting 
companion, telling me about the 
different ships that we passed by, 
their rig, tonnage, and nationality, 
explaining the work that was going 
forward—how one was: discharging, 
another taking in cargo, and a third 
making ready for sea; and every now 
and then telling me some little anec- 
dote of ships or seamen, or repeating 
a nautical phrase till I had learned 
it perfectly. I began to see that here 
was one of the best of possible ship- 
mates. 
When we got to the inn, the squire 
and Dr. Livesey were seated together, 
finishing a quart of ale with a toast 
in it, before they should go aboard 
the schooner on a visit of inspection. 
Long John told the story from first 
to last, with a great deal of spirit and 
the most perfect truth. “That was how 
it were, now, weren’t it, Hawkins?” 
he would say, now and again, and I 
could always bear him entirely out. 
The two gentlemen regretted that 
Black Dog had got away; but we all 
agreed there was nothing to be done, 
and after he had been complimented, 
Long John took up his crutch and 
departed. 
“All hands aboard by four this 
afternoon,” shouted the squire after 
him. 
“Aye, aye, sir,” 
the passage. 
“Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I 
don’t put much faith in your dis- 
coveries, as a general thing; but I 
will say this, John Silver suits me.” 
“The man’s a perfect trump,” de- 
clared the squire. 
“And now,” added the doctor, “Jim 
may come on board with us, may he 
not?” cried the cook, in 50

“To be sure he may,” says squire. 
“Take your hat, Hawkins, and we'll

| CHAPTER IX 
Powprer anp ARMS 
The Hispaniola lay some way out, 
and we went under the figureheads 
and round the sterns of many other 
ships, and their cables sometimes 
grated underneath our keel, and 
sometimes swung above us. At last, 
10 however, we got alongside, and were 
met and saluted as we stepped aboard 
by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old 
sailor, with earrings in his ears and 
a squint. He and the squire were 
' "very thick and friendly, but I soon 
observed that things were not the 
same between Mr. Trelawney and 
the captain. 
i This last was a sharp-looking man, 
20 who seemed angry with everything 
on board, and was soon to tell us why, 
for we had hardly got down into the 
cabin when a sailor followed us. 
“Captain Smollett, sir, axing to 
speak with you,” said he. 
» .  “E am always at the captain’s 
orders.’ Show him in,” said the squire. 
The captain, who was close behind 
his messenger, entered at once, and 
30 shut the door behind him. 
“Well, Captain Smollett, what have 
youtosay? All well, I hope; all ship- 
shape and seaworthy?” 
“Well, sir,” said the captain, “better 
speak plain, I believe, even at the risk 
of offense. I don’t like this cruise; 
I don’t like the men; and I don’t like 
my officer. ' That’s short and sweet.” 
“Perhaps, sir, you don’t like the 
| 40 ship?” inquired the squire, very an- 
: gry, as I could see. 
“¥ can’t speak as to that, sir, not 
| having seen her tried,” said the cap- 
| tain. “She seems a clever craft; 
more I can’t say.” 
|   THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“Possibly, sir, you may not like 
your employer, either?” says the 
squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. 
“Stay a bit,” said he, “stay a bit. 
No use of such questions as that but 
to produce ill-feeling. The captain 
has said too much or he has said too 
little, and I’m bound to say that I 
require an explanation of his words. 
You don’t, you say, like this cruise. 
Now, why?” 
“I was engaged, sir, on what we 
call sealed. orders, to sail this ship 
for that gentleman where he should 
bid me,” said the captain. “So far so 
good. But now I find that every 
man before the mast knows more than 
I do. I don’t call that fair, now, do 
you?” . 
“No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t.” 
“Next,” said the captain, “I learn 
we are going after treasure—hear it 
from my own hands, mind you. Now, 
treasure is ticklish work; I don’t like 
treasure voyages on any account; 
and I don’t like them, above all, when 
they are secret, and when (begging 
your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the 
secret has been told to the parrot.” 
“Silver’s parrot?” asked the squire. 
“Tt’s a way of speaking,” said the 
captain. “Blabbed, I mean. It’s my 
belief neither of you gentlemen know 
what you are about; but I'll tell you 
my way of it—life or death, and a 
close run.” 
“That is all clear, and, I daresay, 
true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey. 
“We take the risk; but we are not so 
ignorant as you believe us. Next, 
you say you don’t like the crew. 
Are they not good seamen?” 
“T don’t like them, sir,” returned 
Captain Smollett. “And I think I 
should have had the choosing of my 
own hands, if you go to that.” 
“Perhaps you should,” replied the 
doctor. “My friend should, perhaps, 
have taken you along with him;: but 70

the slight, if there be one, was unin- 
tentional. And you don’t like Mr. 
Arrow?” 
“T don’t, sir. I believe he’s a good 
seaman; but he’s too free with the 
crew to be a good officer. A mate 
should keep himself to himself— 
shouldn’t drink with the men before 
the mast!” 
“Do you mean he drinks?” cried 
the squire. , 
“No, sir,” replied the captain; 
“only that he’s too familiar.” 
“Well, now, and the short and. 
long of it, captain?” asked the doctor. 
“Tell us what you want.” 
“Well, gentlemen, are you deter- 
mined to go on this cruise?” 
“Like iron,” answered the squire. 
“Very good,” said the captain. 
“Then, as you’ve heard me very 
patiently, saying things that I could 
not prove, hear me a few words more. 
They are putting the powder and the 
arms in the forehold. Now, you have 
a good place under the cabin; why 
not put them there?—first point. 
Then you are bringing four of your 
own people with you, and they tell 
me some of them are to be berthed 
forward. Why not give them the 
berths here beside the cabin?—sec- 
ond point.” 
“Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney. 
“One more,” said the captain. 
“There’s been too much blabbing 
already.” 
“Far too much,” agreed the doctor. 
‘Tl tell you what I’ve heard my- 
self,” continued Captain Smollett; 
“that you have a map of an island; 
that there’s crosses on the.map to 
show where treasure is; and that the 
island lies—” And then he named the 
latitude and longitude exactly. 
_“T never told that,” cried the squire, 
“to a soul!” 
“The hands know it, sir,” returned 
the captain. 113 
“Livesey, that must have been you 
or Hawkins,” cried the squire. 
“Tt doesn’t matter much who it 
was,” replied the doctor. And I 
could: see that neither he nor the 
captain paid much regard to Mr. 
Trelawney’s protestations. Neither 
did I, to be sure, he was so loose a 
talker; yet in this case I believe he 
was really right, and that nobody had 
told the situation of the island. 
“Well, gentlemen,” continued the 
captain, “I don’t know who has this 
map; but I make it a point, it shall 
be kept secret even from me and 
Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask 
you to let me resign.” 
“I see,” said the doctor. “You 
wish us to keep this matter dark, and 
to make a garrison of the stern part 
of the ship, manned with my friend’s 
own people, and provided with all 
the arms and powder on board. In 
other words, -you fear a mutiny.” 
“Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with 
no intention to take offense, I deny 
your right to put words into my 
mouth. No captain, sir, would be 
justified in going to sea at all if he had 
ground enough to say that. As for 
Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly 
honest; some of the men are the 
same; all may be for what I know. 
But I am responsible for the sbip’s 
safety and the life of every man Jack 
aboard of her. I see things going, as 
I think, not quite right. And I ask 
you to take certain precautions, or let 
me resign my berth. And that’s all.” 
“Captain Smollett,” began the doc- 
tor, with a smile, “did ever you hear 
the fable of the mountain and the 
mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare- 
say, but you remind me of that fable. 
When you came in here, I'll stake my 
wig you meant more than this.” 
“Doctor,” said the captain, “you 
are smart. When I came in here I 
meant to get discharged. I had no 50 a ©

114 
thought that Mr. Trelawney would 
hear a word.” 
“No more I would,” cried the 
squire. ‘‘Had Livesey not been here, I 
should have seen you to the deuce. As 
itis, [have heard you. I will doas you 
desire; but I think the worse of You.’ 
“That's as you please, sir,” said 
the captain. “You'll find I do my 
io duty.” 
And with that he took his leave. 
“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “con- 
trary to all my notions, I believe you 
have managed to get two honest men 
on board with you—that man and 
John Silver.” 
_ “Silver, if you like,” cried the 
squire; “but as for that intolerable 
humbug, I declare I think his conduct 
20 unmanly, unsailorly, and downright 
un-English.” 
“Well,” says the doctor, 
see.” 
‘When we came on deck, the men 
had begun already to take out the 
arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their 
work, while the captain and Mr. 
Arrow stood by superintending. 
The new arrangement was quite to 
30 my liking. The whole schooner had “we shall 
been overhauled; six berths had been’ 
made astern, out of what had been the 
after-part of the main hold; and this 
set of cabins was only joined to the 
galley and forecastle by a sparred. 
passage on the port side. It had 
been originally meant that the captain, 
Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor 
and the squire were to occupy these 
40 six berths. Now, Redruth and I were 
to get. two of them, and Mr. Arrow 
and the captain were to sleep on 
deck in the companion which had 
been enlarged on each side till you 
might almost have called it a round- 
house. Very low it was still, of 
course; but there was room to swing THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
two hammocks, and even the mate 
seemed pleased with the arrange- 
ment. Even he, perhaps, had been 
doubtful as to the crew, but that is 
only guess; for as you shall hear, we 
had not long the benefit of his opinion. 
We were all hard at work, changing 
the powder and the berths, when the 
last man or two, and Long John 
along with them, came off in a shore- 
boat. 
The cook came up the side like a 
monkey for cleverness, and, as soon 
as he saw what was doing, “So ho, 
mates!’ says he, “what's this?” 
“We're a-changing of the powder, 
Jacek,” answers one. 
“Why, by the powers,” cried Long 
John, “if we do, we'll miss the morn- 
ing tide!” 
“My orders!’ said the captain 
shortly. “You may go below, my 
man. Hands will want supper.” 
“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the cook; 
and, touching his forelock, he dis- 
appeared at once in the direction of 
his galley. 
“That’s a good man, captain,” said 
the doctor. ‘ 
“Very likely, sir,” replied Captain 
Smollett. ‘Easy with that, men— 
easy,” he ran on, to the fellows who 
were shifting the powder; and then 
suddenly observing me examining the 
swivel we carried amidships, a long 
brass nine— ‘Here, you ship’s boy,” 
he cried, “out o’ that! Off with you 
to the cook and get some work.” 
And then as I was hurrying off I 
heard him say, quite loudly, to the 
doctor: 
“Tl have no favorites on my ship.” 
I assure you I was quite of the 
squire’s way of thinking, and hated 
the captain deeply.

TREASURE ISLAND 
CHAPTER X 
Tue Voyrace 
All that night we were in a great 
bustle getting things stowed in their 
places, and boatfuls of the squire’s 
friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, 
coming off to wish him a good voyage ' 
and a safe return. We never had a 
night at the “Admiral Benbow” when 
I had half the work; and I was dog- 
tired. when, a little before dawn, the 
boatswain sounded his pipe, and the 
crew began to man the capstan bars. 
I might have been twice as weary, 
yet I would not have left the deck; 
all was so new and interesting to me— 
the brief commands, the shrill note 
of the whistle, the men bustling to 
their places in the glimmer of the 
ship’s lanterns. 
“Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,” 
cried one voice. 
“The old one,” cried another. 
“Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, 
who was standing by, with his crutch 
under his arm, and at once broke out 
in the air and words I knew so well: 
Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest— 
and then the whole crew bore chorus: 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
and at the third “ho!” drove the bars 
before them with a will. 
Even at that exciting moment it 
carried me back to the old “Admiral 
Benbow” in a second; and I seemed 
to hear the voice of the captain piping 
in the chorus. But soon the anchor 
was short up; soon it was hanging 
dripping at the bows; soon the sails 
began to draw, and the land and 
shipping to flit by on either side; and 
before I could lie down to snatch an 
hour of slumber the Hispaniola had. 
begun her voyage to the Isle of 
Treasure. 
I am not going to relate that voy- 
age jn detail. It was fairly pros- 15 
perous. The ship proved to be a 
good ship, the crew were capable 
seamen, and the captain thoroughly 
understood his business. But before 
we came the length of Treasure 
Island, two or three things had hap- 
pened which require to be known. 
Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out 
even worse than the captain had 
feared. He had no command among 
the men, and people did what they 
pleased with him. But that was by 
no means the worst of it, for after a 
day or two at sea he began to appear 
on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, 
stuttering tongue, and other marks of 
drunkenness. Time after time he 
was ordered below in disgrace. Some- 
times he fell and cut himself; some- 
times he lay all day long in his little 
bunk at one side of the companion; 
sometimes for a day or two he would 
be almost sober and attend to his 
work at least passably. 
In the meantime, we could never 
make out where he got the drink. 
That was the ship’s mystery. Watch 
him as we pleased, we could do nothing 
to solve it; and when we asked him 
to his face, he would only laugh, if he 
were drunk, and if he were sober, 
“deny solemnly that he ever tasted 
anything but water. 
He was not. only. useless as an 
officer, anda bad influence amongst 
the men, but it was plain that at this 
rate he must ‘soon kill himself out- 
right; so nobody was much surprised, 
nor very sorry, when one dark night, 
with a head sea, he disappeared en- 
tirely and was séen no more. 
“Overboard!” said the captain. 
“Well, gentlemen, that saves the 
trouble of putting him in irons.” 
But there we were, without a mate; 
and it was necessary, of course, to 
advance one of the men. The boat- 
swain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest 
man aboard, and, though he kept his 80 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  116 
old title, he served in a way as mate. 
Mr. Trelawney had followed the 
sea, and his knowledge made him 
very useful, for he often took a watch 
himself in easy weather. And the 
coxswain, Israel Hands, was a care- 
ful, wily, old, experienced seaman, who 
could be trusted at a pinch with 
almost anything. He was a great con- 
10 fidant of Long John Silver, and so the 
mention of his name leads me on to 
speak of our ship’s cook, Barbecue, as 
the-men called him. 
Aboard ship he carried his crutch 
by a lanyard round his neck, to have 
both hands.as free as possible. It was 
. something to see him wedge the foot 
of the crutch against a bulkhead, and, 
propped against it, yielding to every 
20 movement of the ship, get on with 
his cooking, like someone safe ashore. 
- Still more strange was it to see him 
in, the heaviest of weather cross the 
deck. He had a line or two rigged up 
to help him across the widest spaces— 
Long John’s earrings, they were called; 
and he would hand himself from one. 
place to another, now using the 
crutch, now trailing it alongside by 
30 the lanyard, as quickly as another 
man could walk. Yet some of the 
men who had sailed with him before 
expressed their pity to see him so 
reduced. 
“He’s no common man, Barbecue,” 
said the coxswain to me. 
good schooling in his young days, and 
can speak like a book when so minded; 
and brave—a lion’s nothing alongside 
40 of Long John! I seen him grapple 
four, and knock their heads together— 
him unarmed.” 
All the crew respected and even 
obeyed him. He had a way of talking 
to each, and doing everybody some 
particular service. To me he was. 
unweariedly kind;’ and always glad 
. to see me in the galley, which he kept 
as clean as a new pin; the dishes “He had. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
hanging up burnished and his parrot 50 
in a cage in one corner. 
“Come away, Hawkins,” he would 
say; “come and have a yarn with 
John. Nobody more welcome than 
yourself, my son. Sit you down and 
hear the news. Here’s Cap’n Flint— 
I calls my parrot Cap’n Flint, after 
the famous buccaneer—here’s Cap’n 
Flint: predicting success to our v’yage. 
Wasn’t you, Cap'n?” 
And the parrot would say, with 
great rapidity, “Pieces of eight! pieces 
of eight! pieces of eight!’ till you 
wondered that it was not out of 
breath, or till John threw his hand- 
kerchief over the cage. 
“Now, that bird,” he would say, 
“fs, maybe, two hundred years old, 
Hawkins—they lives forever mostly; 
and if anybody’s seen more wicked- 
ness, it must be the devil himself. 
She’s sailed with England, the great 
Cap’n England, the pirate. She’s 
been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, 
and Surinam, and Providence, and 
Portobello. She was at the fishing 
up of the wrecked plate ships. It’s 
there she learned ‘Pieces of eight,’ and 
little wonder; three hundred and 
fifty thousand of ’em, Hawkins! She 
was at the boarding of the Viceroy of 
the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to 
look at her you would think she was 
a babby. But you smelt powder— 
didn’t you, Cap’n?” 
“Stand by to go about,” the parrot 
would scream. 
“Ah, she’s a handsome craft, she 
is,” the cook would say, and give her 
sugar from his pocket, and then the 
bird would peck at the bars and 
swear straight on, passing belief for 
wickedness. ‘““There,” John would 
add, “you can’t touch pitch and not 
be mucked, lad. Here’s this poor old 
innocent bird o’ mine swearing blue

fire, and none the wiser, you may lay 
to that. She would swear the same, 
in a manner of speaking, before chap- 
lain.’ And John would touch his 
forelock with a solemn way he had, 
that made me think he was the best 
of men. 
In the meantime, squire and Cap- 
tain Smollétt were still on pretty 
distant terms with one another. The 
squire made no bones about the mat- 
ter; he despised the captain. The 
captain, on his part, never spoke but 
when he was spoken to, and then 
sharp and short and dry, and not a 
word wasted. He owned, when driven 
into a corner, that he seemed to have 
been wrong about the crew, that some 
of them were as brisk as he wanted to 
see, and all had behaved fairly well. 
As for the ship, he had taken a down- 
right fancy to her. “She'll lie a 
point nearer the wind than a man 
has a right to expect of his own mar- 
ried wife, sir. But,’’ he would add, 
“all I say is we’re not home again, 
and I don’t like the cruise.” 
The squire, at this, would turn 
away and march up and down the 
deck, chin in air. 
“A trifle more of that man,” he 
would say, “and I should explode.” 
We had some heavy weather, which 
only proved the qualities of the 
Hispaniola. Every man on board 
seemed well contented, and they 
must have been hard to please if they 
had been otherwise; for it is my be- 
lief there was never a ship’s company 
so spoiled since Noah put to sea. 
Double grog was going on the least 
excuse; there was duff on odd days, 
as, for instance, if the squire heard 
it was any man’s birthday; and al- 
ways a barrel of apples standing 
broached in the waist, for. anyone to 
help himself that had a fancy. 
46, broached in the waist, open in the central part of nf SP" pen Part ol 117 
“Never knew good come of it,” the 
captain said to Dr. Livesey. “Spoil 
foc’s’le hands, make devils. That’s 
my belief.” 
But good did come of the apple 
barrel, as you shall hear; for if it 
had not been for that, we should have 
had no note of warning, and might 
all have perished by the hand of 
treachery. 
This was how it came about. 
We had run up the trades to get 
the wind of the island we were after— 
I am not allowed to be more plain— 
and now we were running down for it 
with a bright lookout day and night. 
It was about the last day of our 
outward voyage, by the largest com- 
putation; some time that night, or, 
at latest, before noon of the morrow, 
we should sight the Treasure Island. 
We were heading S.S.W., and had 
a steady breeze abeam and a quiet 
sea, The Hispaniola rolled steadily, 
dipping her bowsprit now and then 
with a whiff of spray. All was draw- 
ing alow and aloft; everyone was in 
the bravest spirits, because we were 
now so near an end of the first part of 
our adventure. 
Now, just after sundown, when all 
my work was over, and I was on my 
way to my berth, it occurred to me 
that I should like an apple. Iran on 
deck. The watch was all forward 
looking out for the island. The man 
at the helm was watching the luff of 
the sail, and whistling away gently 
to himself; and that was the only 
sound excepting the swish of the 
sea against the bows and around the 
sides of the ship. 
In I got bodily into the apple bar- 
rel, and found there was scarce an 
apple left; but, sitting down there in 
the dark, what with the sound of the 
waters and the rocking movement of

was Silver’s voice, and, before I had 
heard a dozen words, I would not have 
shown myself for all the world, but 
lay there, trembling and listening, 
in the extreme of fear and curiosity; 
for from these dozen words I under- 
stood that the lives of all the honest 
men aboard depended upon me alone. 
CHAPTER XI 
Wuat I Hearp in roe APPLE BARREL 
“No, not I,” said Silver. “Flint 
was cap’n; I was quartermaster, 
along of my timber leg. The same 
broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost 
his deadlights. It was a master sur- 
geon, him that ampytated me—out of 
college and all—Latin by the bucket, 
and what not; but he was hanged like 
a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at 
Corso Castle. That was Roberts’ 
men, that was, and comed of changing 
names to their ships—Royal Fortune 
and so on. Now, what a ship was 
christened, so let her stay, I says. 
So it was with the Cassandra, as 
brought us all safe home from Malabar, 
after England took the Viceroy of the 
Indies; so it was with the old Walrus, 
Flint’s old ship, as I have seen amuck 
with the red blood and fit to sink with 
gold.” 
“Ah!” cried another voice, that of 
the youngest hand on board, and evi- 
dently full of admiration, “the was the 
flower of the flock, was Flint!’ 
“Davis was a man too, by all ac- 
counts,” said Silver. “I never sailed 
along of him; first with England, then 
with Flint, that’s my story; and now ’ cried Silver. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
here on my own account, in a manner 
of speaking. I laid by nine hundred 
safe, from England, and two thousand 
after Flint. That ain’t bad for.a man 
before the mast—all safe in bank. 
°Tain’t earning now, it’s saving does 
it, you may lay to that. Where’s all 
England’s men now? I dunno. 
Where’s Flint’s? Why, most on ’em 
aboard here, and glad to get the duff— 
been begging before that, some on ’em. 
Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and 
might have thought shame, spends 
twelve hundred pound in a year, like 
a lord in Parliament. Where is he 
now? Well, he’s dead now and under 
hatches; but for two year before that, 
shiver my timbers! the man was 
starving. He begged, and he stole, 
and he cut throats, and starved at 
that, by the powers!” 
‘Well, it ain’t much use, after all,’ 
said the young seaman. 
“°Tain’t much use for fools, you 
may lay to it—that, nor nothing,” 
“But now, you look 
here; you’re young, you are, but 
you’re as smart as paint. I see that 
when I set my eyes on you, and I'll 
talk to you like a man,” 
You may imagine how J felt when 
I heard this abominable old rogue 
addressing another in the very same 
words of flattery as he had used to 
myself. I think, if I had been able, 
that I would have killed him through 
the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, 
little supposing he was overheard. 
“Here it is about gentlemen of 
fortune. They lives rough, and they 
risk swinging, but they eat and drink 
like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise 
is done, why, it’s hundreds of pounds 
instead of hundreds of farthings in 
their pockets. Now, the most goes 
for rum and a good fling, and to sea 
again in their shirts. But that’s not 
the course I Jay. I puts it all away, 
some here, some there, and none too 50

much anywheres, by reason of sus- 
picion. I’m fifty, mark you; once 
back from this cruise, I set up gentle- 
man in earnest. Time enough, too, 
says you. Ah, but I’ve lived easy 
in the meantime; never denied my- 
self o’ nothing heart desires, and slep’ 
soft and ate dainty all my days, but 
when at sea. And how did I begin? 
Before the mast, like you!” 
“Well,” said the other, “but all the 
other money’s gone now, ain’t it? 
You daren’t show face in Bristol after 
this.” , 
“Why, where might you suppose it 
was?” asked Silver, derisively. 
“At Bristol in banks and places,” 
answered his companion. 
“It were,” said the cook; “it were 
when we weighed anchor. But my 
old missus has it all by now. And the 
‘Spyglass’ is sold, lease and goodwill 
and rigging; and the old girl’s off to 
meet me. I would tell you where, 
for I trust you; but it ’ud make 
jealousy among the mates.” 
“And can you trust your missis?” 
asked the other. 
“Gentlemen of fortune,” returned 
the cook, “usually trusts little among 
themselves, and right they are, you 
may lay to it. But I have a way 
with me, I have. When a mate 
brings a slip on his cable—one as 
knows me, I mean—it won’t be in the 
same world with old John. There 
was some that was feared of Pew, and 
some that was feared of Flint; but 
Flint his own self was feared of me. 
Fearéd he was, and proud. They 
was the roughest crew afloat, was 
Flint’s; the devil himself would have 
been feared to go to sea with them. 
Well, now, I tell you, I’m not a boast- 
ing man, and you seen yourself how 
easy I keep company; but when I was | 
quartermaster, lambs wasn’t the word 
for Flint’s old buccaneers. Ah, you may 
be sure of yourself in old John’s skip.” 119 
“Well, I tell you now,” replied the 
lad, “I didn’t half a quarter like the 
job till I had this talk with you, 
John; but there’s my hand on it now.” 
“And a brave lad you were, and 
_ smart, too,” answered Silver, shaking 
hands so heartily that all the barrel 
shook, “and a finer figurehead for a 
gentleman of fortune I never clapped 
my eyes on.” : 
By this time I had begun to under- 
stand the meaning of their terms. 
By a “gentleman of fortune” they 
plainly meant neither more nor less 
than a common pirate, and the little 
scene that I had overheard was the 
last act in the corruption of one of 
the honest hands—perhaps the last 
one left aboard. But on this point 
I was soon to be relieved, for Silver 
giving a little whistle, a third man 
strolled up and sat down by the party. 
“Dick’s square,” said Silver. 
“Oh, I know’d Dick was square,” 
returned the voice of the coxswain, 
Israel Hands. ‘‘He’s no fool, is Dick.” 
And he turned his quid and spat. 
“But, look here,” he went on, “‘here’s 
what I want to know, Barbecue: how 
long are we a-going to stand off and. 
on like a blessed bumboat? I’ve had 
a’most enough 0’ Cap’n Smollett; he’s 
hazed me long enough, by thunder! 
I want to go into that cabin, I do. 
I want their pickles and wines, and 
that.” 
“Israel,” said Silver, “your head 
ain’t much account, nor ever was. 
But you’re able to hear, I reckon; 
leastways, your ears is big enough. 
Now, here’s what I say; you’ll berth 
forward, and you'll live hard, and 
you'll speak soft, and you'll keep 
sober, till I give the word; and you 
may lay to that, my son.” 
“Well, I don’t say no, do 1?” 
growled the coxswain. “What I say 
is, when? That’s what I say.” 
“When! by the powers!” cried 50

120 
Silver. “Well, now, if you want to 
know, I'll tell you when. The last 
moment I can manage; and that’s 
_when. Here’s a first-rate seaman, 
Cap’n Smollett, sails the blessed ship 
“for us. Here’s this squire and doctor. 
‘with a map and such—I don’t know 
‘where it is, do I? No more do you, 
says you. Well, then, I mean this 
10 squire and doctor shall find the stuff, 
and help us to get it aboard, by the 
powers. Then we'll see. If I was 
“sure of you all, sons of double Dutch- 
‘men, I’d have Cap’n Smollett navi- 
gate us halfway back again before I 
_ struck.” 
“Why, we’re all seamen aboard here, 
-I should think,”’ said the lad Dick. 
“We're all foc’s’le hands, you mean,” 
20 snapped Silver. “We can steer a 
course, but who’s to set one? That’s 
what all you gentlemen split on, first 
and last. If I had my way, I’d have 
Cap’n Smollett work us back into the 
trades at least; then we’d have no 
blessed miscalculations and a spoonful 
of water a day. But I know the sort 
you are. J’ll finish with ’em at the 
“island, as soon’s the blunt’s on board, 
zo and a pity it is. But you’re never 
happy till you’re drunk. Split my 
sides, I’ve a sick heart to sail with the 
likes of you!” 
“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. 
“‘Who’s a-crossin’ of you?” 
“Why, how many tall ships, think 
ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? 
and how many brisk lads drying in 
the sun at Execution Dock?” cried 
40 Silver, “and all for this same hurry 
and hurry and hurry. You hear me? 
I seen a thing or two at sea, I have. 
If you would on’y lay your course, and 
a p’int to windward, you would ride 
in carriages, you would. But not you! 
Iknow you. You'll have your mouth- 
ful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”

* “Everybody know’d you was a kind 
of a chapling, John; but there’s others 
as could hand and steer as well as 
you,” said Israel. “They liked a bit 
o’ fun, they did. They wasn’t so high 
and dry, nohow, but took their fling, 
like jolly companions every one.” 
“So?” says Silver. “Well, and where 
are they now? Pew was that sort, and 
he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and 
he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they 
was a sweet crew, they was! on’y, 
where are they?” 
“But,” asked Dick, “when we do 
‘lay ’em athwart, what are we to do 
with ’em, anyhow?” 
“There’s the man for me!” cried the 
cook, admiringly. “That’s what I call 
business.. Well, what would you think ? 
“Put ’em ashore like maroons? That 
would have been England’s way. Or 
eut ’em down like that much pork? 
That would have been Flint’s or Billy 
Bones’s.” 
“Billy was the man for that,” said 
Israel. “ ‘Dead men don’t bite,’ says 
he. Well, he’s dead now hisself; he 
knows the long and short on it now; 
and if ever a rough hand come to port, 
it was Billy.” 
“Right you are,” said Silver, “rough 
and ready. But mark you here: I’m 
an easy man—I’m quite the gentle- 
man, says you; but this time it’s 
serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. [ 
give my vote—death. When I’m in 
Parlyment, and riding in my coach, 
I don’t want none of these sea- 
lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, 
unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. 
Wait is what I say; but when the time 
comes, why let her rip!” 
“John,” cries the coxswain, “you’re 
a man!” . 
“You'll say so, Israel, when you 
see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I 
claim—I claim Trelawney. ‘I'll wring 
his calf’s head off his body with these

hands. Dick!’ he added, breaking 
off, “you just jump up, like a sweet 
lad, and get me an apple, to wet my 
pipe like.” 
You may fancy the terror I was in! 
I should have leaped out and run for 
it, if I had found the strength; but 
my limbs and heart alike misgave me. 
I heard Dick begin to rise, and then 
someone seemingly stopped him, and 
the voice of Hands exclaimed: 
“Oh, stow that! Don’t you get 
sucking of that bilge, John. Let’s have 
a go of the rum.” 
“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust. you. 
T’ve a gauge on the keg, mind. There’s 
the key; you fill a pannikin and bring 
it up.” 
Terrified as I was, I could not help 
thinking to myself that this must 
have been how Mr. Arrow got the 
strong waters that destroyed him. 
Dick was gone but a little while, and 
during his absence Israel spoke straight 
on in the cook’s ear. It was but a 
word or two that I could catch, and 
yet I gathered some important news; 
for, besides other scraps that tended 
to the same purpose, this whole clause 
was audible: “Not another man of 
them’ll jine.” Hence there were still 
faithful men on board. 
When Dick returned, one after an- 
other of the trio took the pannikin 
and drank-—one “To luck”; another 
with a “Here’s to old Flint”; and 
Silver himself saying, in a kind of 
song, 
your luff, plenty of prizes and plenty 
of duff.” 
Just then a sort of brightness fell 
upon me in the barrel, and, looking 
up, I found the moon had risen, and 
was silvering the mizzen-top and 
shining white on the luff of the fore- 
sail; and almost at the same time the

CHAPTER XII 
Covuncrn or War . 
There was a: great rush of feet 
across the deck. I could hear people 
tumbling up from the cabin and the 
foe’s‘le; and, slipping in an instant 
outside my barrel, I dived behind the 
foresail, made a double toward the 
stern, and came out upon the open 
deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. 
Livesey in the rush for the weather 
bow. 
There all hands were already con- 
gregated. A belt of fog had lifted 
almost simultaneously with the ap- 
pearance of the moon. Away to the 
southwest of us we saw two low hills, 
about a couple of miles apart, and ris- 
ing behind one of them a third and 
higher hill, whose peak was still 
buried in the fog. All three seemed 
sharp and conical in figure. 
So much I saw, almost in a dream, 
for I had not: yet recovered from my 
horrid fear of a minute or two before. 
And then I heard the voice of Captain 
Smollett issuing orders. The His- 
paniola was laid a couple of points 
nearer the wind, and now sailed a 
course that would just clear the island 
on the east. 
“And now, men,” * said the captain 
when all was sheeted home, “has any- 
one of you ever seen that land ahead?” 
“T have, sir,” said Silver. “I’ve 
watered there with a trader I was 
cook in.” 
“The anchorage is on the south, 
behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the 
captain. 
“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls 
it. Tt were a main place for pirates

are as far apart as possible. 60

once, and a hand we had on board 
knowed all their names for it. That 
hill to the nor’ard they call the Fore- 
mast Hill; there are three hills in a 
row running south’ard—fore, main, 
and mizzen, sir. But the main—that’s 
the big ’un with the cloud on it—they 
usually calls the Spyglass, by reason 
of 2a lookout they kept when they was 
10 in anchorage cleaning; for it’s there 
they cleaned their ships, sir, asking © 
your pardon.” 
“T have a chart here,” says Captain 
Smollett. “See if that’s the place.” 
Long John’s eyes burned in his 
head as he took the chart; but, by 
the fresh look of the paper, I knew 
he was doomed to disappointment. 
This was not the map we found in 
20 Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate 
copy, complete in all things—names 
and heights and soundings—with the 
single exception of the red crosses and 
the written notes. Sharp as must 
have been his annoyance, Silver had 
had the strength of mind to hide it. 
“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot 
to be sure; and very prettily drawed 
out. Who might have done that, I 
30 wonder? The pirates were too ig- 
norant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 
‘Capt. ‘Kidd’s Anchorage’-—just the 
name my shipmate called it. There’s 
a strong ‘current runs along the south, 
and then away nor’ard up the west 
coast. Right you was, sir,” says he, 
“to haul your wind and keep the 
weather of the island. Leastways, if 
such was your intention as to enter 
40 and careen, and there ain’t no better 
place for that in these waters.” 
“Thank you, my man,” says Cap- 
tain Smollett. “I'll ask you, later on, 
to give us a help. You may go.” 
I was surprised at the coolness with 
which John avowed his knowledge of 
the island; and I own I was half- 
frightened when I saw him drawing 
nearer to myself. He did not know, THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
to be sure, that I had overheard his 5 
council from the apple barrel, and yet 
Thad, by this time, taken such a horror 
of his cruelty, duplicity, and power, 
that I could scarce conceal a shudder 
when he laid his hand upon my arm. 
“Ah,” says he, “this here is a sweet 
spot, this island—a sweet spot for a 
lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, 
and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt 
goats, you will; and you'll get aloft « 
on them hills like a goat yourself. 
Why, it makes me young again. I 
was going to forget my timber leg, I 
was. It’s a pleasant thing to be 
young, and have ten toes, and you 
may lay to that. When you want 
to go a bit of exploring, you just ask 
old John, and he’ll put up a snack for 
you to take along.” 
And clapping me in the friendliest 7 
way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off 
forward and went below. 
Captain Sinollett, the squire, and 
Dr. Livesey were talking together on 
the quarter-deck, and, anxious as I 
was to tell them my story, I durst not 
interrupt them openly. While I was 
still casting about in my thoughts to 
find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey 
called me to his side. He had left his s 
pipe below, and being a slave to to- 
bacco, had meant that I should fetch 
it; but as soon as I was near enough 
to speak and not to be overheard, I 
broke out immediately: “Doctor, let 
me speak. Get the captain and 
squire down to the cabin, and then 
make some pretense to send for me. 
T have terrible news.” 
The doctor changed countenance a 9 
little, but next moment he was 
master of himself. 
“Thank you, Jim,” said he, quite 
loudly, “that was all I wanted to 
know,” as if he had asked me a ques- 
tion. 
And with that he turned on his 
heel and rejoined the other two.

S r s 8 _ TREASURE ISLAND 
They spoke together for a little, and 
though none of them started, or raised 
his voice, or so much as whistled, it was 
plain enough that Dr. Livesey had 
communicated my request; for the 
next thing that I heard was the captain 
giving an order to Job Anderson, and 
all hands were piped on deck. 
“My lads,” said Captain Smollett, 
“‘T’ve a word to say to you. This 
land that we have sighted is the place 
we have been sailing for. Mr. Tre- 
lawney, being a very open-handed 
gentleman, as we all know, has just 
asked me a word or two, and as I was 
able to tell him that every man on 
board had done his duty, alow an’ 
aloft, as I never ask to see it done 
better, why, he and I and the doctor 
are going below to the cabin to drink 
your health and luck, and you'll have 
grog served out for you to drink our 
health and luck. I'll tell you what 
I think of this: I think it handsome. 
And if you think as I do, you'll give 
a good sea cheer for the gentleman that 
does it.” 
The cheer followed—that was a 
matter of course; but it rang out so 
full and hearty that I confess I could 
hardly believe these same men were 
plotting for our blood. 
“One more cheer for Cap’n Smol- 
lett,” cried Long John, when the first 
had subsided. 
And this also was given with a will. 
On the top of that the three gentle- 
men went below, and not long after, 
word was sent forward that Jim 
Hawkins was wanted in the cabin. 
I found them all three seated round 
the table, a bottle of Spanish wine 
and some raisins before them, and the 
doctor smoking away, with his wig 
on his lap, and that, I knew, was a 
sign that he was agitated. The stern 
window was open, for it was a warm 
night, and you could see the moon 
shining behind on the ship’s wake. 123 
“Now, Hawkins,” said the squire, 
“you have something to say. Speak 
up.” 
I did.as I was bid, and, short as I 
could make it, told the whole details 
of Silver’s conversation. Nobody in- 
terrupted me till I was done, nor did 
any one of the three of them make so 
much as a movement, but they kept 
their eyes upon my face from first to 
last. 
“Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take a 
seat.” 
And they made me sit down at the 
table beside them, poured me out a 
glass of wine, filled my hands with 
raisins, and all three, one after the 
other, and each with a bow, drank 
my good health, and their service to 
me, for my luck and courage. 
“Now, captain,” said the squire, 
“you were right, and I was wrong. 50 
60 
I own myself an ass, and I await your 
orders.” 
“No more an ass than I, sir,” re- 
turned the captain. “I never heard 
of a crew that meant to mutiny but 
what showed signs before, for any 
man that had an eye in his head to 
see the mischief and take steps ac- 
cording. But this crew,” he added, 
“beats me.” 
“Captain,” said the doctor, “with 
your permission, that’s Silver. A very 
remarkable man.” 
“He’d look remarkably well from a 
yardarm, sir,” returned the captain. 
“But this is talk; this don’t lead to 
anything. I see three or-four points, 
and with Mr. Trelawney’s permission, 
T'll name them.” 
“You, sir, are the captain. It is 
for you to speak,” says Mr. Trelawney, 
grandly. . 
“First point,” began Mr. Smollett. 
“We must go on, because we can’t 
turn back. If I gave the word to go 
about, they would rise at once.

is, to take time by the forelock, as the 
saying is, and come to blows some fine

can count, I take it, on your own

“As upon myself,” declared the 
squire. 
“Three,” reckoned the captain, 
“ourselves make seven, counting 
Hawkins here. Now, about the hon- 
est hands?” : 
“Most likely Trelawney’s own 
men,” said the doctor; “those he 
had picked up for himself, before he 
lit on Silver.” “Nay,” replied the 
squire, “Hands was one of mine.” 
“TI did think I could have trusted 
Hands,” added the captain. 
“And to think that they’re all 
Englishmen!’ broke out the squire. 
“Sir, I could find it in my heart to 
blow the ship up.” _pleasanter to come to blows. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“Well, gentlemen,” said the cap- 
tain, “the best that I can say is not 
much. We must lay to, if you please, 
and keep a bright lookout. It’s trying

But

“Jim here,” said the doctor, ‘‘can 
help us more than anyone. The men 
are not shy with him, and Jim is a 
noticing lad.” 
“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith 
in you,” added the squire. 
I began to feel pretty desperate at 
this, for I felt altogether helpless; 
and yet, by an odd train of circum- 
stances, it was indeed through me 
that safety came. 
In the meantime, talk as we pleased, 
there were only seven out of the 
twenty-six on whom we knew we 
could rely; and out of these seven 
one was a boy, so that the grown 
men on our side were six to their 
nineteen.

MY SHORE ADVENTURE 
CHAPTER XIII 
How My Snore Apventure Bucan 
The appearance of the island when 
I came on deck next morning was 
altogether changed. Although the 
breeze had now utterly ceased, we 
had made a great deal of way during 
the night, and were now lying be- 
calmed about half a mile to the south- 
east of the low eastern coast. Gray- 
colored woods covered a large part of S 
deed broken up by streaks of yellow 
sandbreak in the lower lands, and by 
many tall trees of the piné family, 
out-topping the others—some singly, 
some in clumps; but the general color- 
ing was uniform and sad. The hills 
tan up clear above the vegetation in 
spires of naked rock. All were 
strangely shaped, and the Spyglass, 
which was by three or four hundred 
feet the tallest on the island, was 
likewise the strangest in configura- 
tion, running up sheer from almost 
every side, and then suddenly cut off 
at the top like a pedestal to put a 
statue on. : , 
The Hispaniola was rolling scup- 
pers under in the ocean swell. The 
booms were tearing at the blocks, the 
30 rudder was banging to and fro, and 
the whole ship creaking, groaning, and 
jumping like a manufactory. I had 
to cling tight to the backstay, and the 
world turned giddily before my eyes; 
for though I was a good enough sailor 
when there was way on, this standing 
still and being rolled about like a 
bottle was a thing I never learned to 
stand without a qualm or so, above all 
40 in the morning, on an empty stomach. 
Perhaps it was this—perhaps it was 
the look of the island, with its gray, 2 8 the surface. This even tint was in- | melancholy woods, and wild stone 
spires, and the surf that we could 
both see and hear foaming and 
thundering on the steep beach—at 
least, although the sun shone bright 
and hot, and the shore birds were 
fishing and crying all around us, and 
you would have thought anyone 
would have been glad to get to land 
after being so long at sea, my heart 
sank, as the saying is, into my boots; 
and from that first look onward, I 
hated the very thought of Treasure 
Island. 
We had a dreary morning’s work 
before us, for there was no sign of 
any wind, and the boats had to be 
got out and manned, and the- ship 
warped three or four miles round the 
corner of the island, and up -the 
narrow passage to the haven behind 
Skeleton Island. I volunteered for 
one of the boats, where I had, of 
course, no ‘business. The heat was 
sweltering, and’ the men grumbled 
fiercely over their work. Anderson 
was in command of my boat, and 
instead of keeping the crew in order, 
he grumbled as loud as the worst. 
“Well,” he said, with an oath, “‘it’s 
not forever.” : : 
I thought this was a very bad sign; 
for, up to that day, the men had 
gone briskly and willingly about their 
business; but the very sight of the 
island had relaxed the cords of dis- 
cipline. 
All the way in, Long John stood 
by the steersman and conned the 
ship. He knew the passage like the 
palm of his hand; and though the 
man in the chains got everywhere 
more water than was down in the 
chart, John never hesitated once. 
“There’s a strong scour with the
-P-A-G-E-135
10 126 
ebb,” he said, “and this here passage 
has been dug out, in-a manner of 
speaking, with a spade.” 
We brought up just where the 
anchor was in the chart, about a 
third of a mile from each shore, the 
mainland on one side, and Skeleton 
Island on the other. The bottom was 
clean sand. The plunge of our anchor 
sent up clouds of birds wheeling and 
crying over the woods; but in less 
than a minute they were down again, 
and all was once more silent. 
The place was entirely landlocked, 
buried in woods, the trees coming 
right down. to high-water mark, the 
shores mostly flat, and the hilltops 
standing round at a distance in a sort 
of amphitheater, one here, one there. 
Two little rivers, or, rather, two 
swamps, emptied out into this pond, 
as you might call it; and the foliage 
round that part of the shore had a 
kind of poisonous brightness. From 
the ship, we could see nothing of the 
house or stockade, for they were quite 
buried among trees; and if it had not 
been for the chart on the companion, 
we might have been the first that had 
ever anchored there since the island 
arose out of the seas. 
There was not a breath of air 
moving, nor a sound but that of the 
surf booming half a mile away along 
the beaches and against the rocks 
outside. A peculiar stagnant smell 
hung over the anchorage—a smell of 
sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. 
I observed the doctor sniffing and 
sniffing, like someone tasting a bad 
egg. 
“JT don’t know about treasure,” he 
said, “but I'll stake my wig there’s 
fever here.” : 
If the conduct of the men had been 
alarming in the boat, it became truly 
threatening when they had come 
aboard. They lay about. the deck 
growling together in talk. The slight- THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
est order was received with a black 
look, and grudgingly and carelessly 
obeyed. Even the honest hands must 
have caught the infection, for there 
was not one man aboard to mend an- 
other. Mutiny, it was plain, hung 
over us like a thundercloud. 
And it was not only we of the 
cabin party who perceived the danger. 
Long John was hard at work going 
from group to group, spending him- 
self in good advice, and as for example 
no man could have shown a better. 
He fairly outstripped himself in will- 
ingness and civility; he was all smiles 
toeveryone. If an order were given, 
John would be on his crutch in an 
instant, with the cheeriest “Aye, aye, 
sir!’ in the world; and when there 
was nothing else to do, he kept up 
one song after another, as if to conceal 
the discontent of the rest. 
Of all the gloomy features of that 
gloomy afternoon, this obvious anxiety 
on the part of Long John appeared the 
worst, 
We held a council in the cabin. 
“Sir,” said the captain, “if I risk 
another order the whole ship’ll come 
about our ears by the run. You see, 
sir, here it is. I get a rough answer, 
do I not? Well, if I speak back, 
pikes will be going in two shakes; 
if I don’t, Silver will see there’s 
something under that, and the game’s 
up. Now, we’ve only one man to 
rely on.” 
“And who is that?” 
squire. , 
“Silver, sir,” returned the captain; 
“he’s as anxious as you and I to 
smother things up. This is’ a tiff; 
he’d soon talk ’em out of it if he had 
the chance, and what I propose to 
do is to give him the chance. Let’s 
allow the men an afternoon ashore. 
If they all go, why, we'll fight the 
ship. If they none of them go, well, 
then, we hold the cabin, and God asked the
-P-A-G-E-136
eo RS Rn = Te TREASURE ISLAND 
defend the right. If some go, you. 
mark my words, sir, Silver’ll bring 
‘em aboard again as mild as lambs.” 
It was so decided; loaded pistols 
were served out to all the sure men; 
Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were 
taken into our confidence, and received 
the news with less surprise and a better 
spirit than we had looked for, and then 
the captain went on deck and ad- 
dressed the crew. 
“My lads,” said he, “we’ve had a 
hot day, and are all tired and out of 
sorts, A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody— 
the boats are still in the water; you 
can take the gigs, and as many as 
please can go ashore for the afternoon. 
Til fire a gun half an hour before 
sundown.” 
I believe the silly fellows must have 
thought they would break their shins 
over treasure as soon as they were 
landed; for they all came out of their 
sulks in a moment, and gave a cheer 
that started the echo in a far-away 
ill, and sent the birds once more 
flying and squalling round the an- 
chorage. . 
The captain was too bright to be 
in the way. He whipped out of sight 
in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange 
the party; and I fancy it was as well 
he did so. Had he been on deck, he 
could no longer so much as have 
pretended not to understand the 
situation. It was as plain as day. 
Silver was the captain, and a mighty 
rebellious crew he had of it. The 
honest hands—and I was soon to see 
it proved that there were such on 
board—must have been very stupid 
fellows. Or, rather, I suppose the 
truth was this, that all hands were 
disaffected by the example of the 
ringleaders—only some more, some 
less; and a few, being good fellows 
in the main, could neither be led nor 
driven any further. It is one thing 
to be idle and skulk, and quite an- 127 
other to take a ship and murder a 
number of innocent men. 
At last, however, the party was 
made up. Six fellows were to stay 
on board, and the remaining thirteen, 
including Silver, began to embark. 
Then it was that there came into 
my head the first of the mad notions 
that contributed so much to save our 
lives. If six men were left by Silver, 
it was plain our party could not take 
and fight the ship; and since only 
six were left, it was equally plain 
that the cabin party had no present 
need of my assistance. It occurred 
to me at once'to go ashore. In a 
jiffy I had slipped over the side, and 
curled up in the foresheets of the 
nearest boat; and almost at the same 
moment she shoved off. 
No one took notice of me, only the 
bow oar saying, “Is that: you, Jim? 
Keep your head down.” But Silver, 
_ from the other boat, looked sharply 
over and called out to know if that 
were me; and from that moment I 
began to regret what I had done. 
The crews raced. for the beach; 
but the boat I was in, having some 
start, and being at once the lighter 
and the better manned, shot far 
ahead of her consort, and the bow 
had struck among the shore-side trees, 
and I had caught a branch and swung 
myself out, and plunged into the 
nearest thicket, while Silver and the 
rest were still a hundred yards behind. 
“Jim, Jim!’ I heard him shouting. 
But you may suppose I paid no 
heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking 
through, I ran straight before my 
nose, till I could run no longer.

I was so pleased at having given . 
the slip to Long John that I began to 
enjoy myself and look around me
-P-A-G-E-137
1 
3 128 
with some interest on the strange land 
that I was in. 
I had crossed a marshy tract, full 
of willows, bulrushes, and odd, out- 
landish swampy trees; and I had now 
come out upon the skirts of an open 
piece of undulating, sandy country, 
about a mile long, dotted with a 
few pines, and a great number of 
contorted trees, not unlike the oak 
in growth, but pale in the foliage, like 
willows. On the far side of the open 
stood one of the hills, with two quaint, 
craggy peaks, shining vividly in the 
sun. 
I now felt for the first time the joy 
of exploration. The isle was unin- 
habited; miy shipmates I had left 
behind, and nothing lived in front of 
me but dumb brutes and fowls. I 
turned hither and thither among the 
trees.- Here and there were flowering 
plants, unknown to me; here and 
there I saw snakes, and one raised his 
head from a ledge of rock and hissed 
at me with a noise not unlike the 
spinning of a top. Little did I sup- 
pose that he was a deadly enemy, and 
that the noise was the famous rattle. 
Then I came to a long thicket of 
these oak-like trees—live, or ever- 
green, oaks, I heard afterwards they 
should be called—which grew low 
along the sand like brambles, the 
boughs curiously twisted, the foliage 
compact like thatch. The thicket 
stretched down from the top of one 
of the sandy’ knolls, spreading and 
growing taller as it went, until it 
reached the margin of the broad, 
reedy fen, through which the nearest 
of the little rivers soaked its way 
into the anchorage. The marsh was 
steaming in the strong sun, and the 
outline of the Spyglass trembled 
through the haze. 
All at once there began to go a sort 
of bustle among the bulrushes; a wild 
duck flew up with a quack, another THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
followed, and soon over the 
surface of the marsh a great c! 
birds hung screaming and. circling in 
the air. I judged at once 
of my shipmates must t 
near along the borders 
Nor was I deceived; for sc 
the very distant and low 
human voice, which, as I 
to give ear, grew steadily 
nearer. 
This put me in a great fear, and I 
crawled under cover of th 
live-oak, and squatted there 
ing, as silent as a mouse. 
Another voice answered: 
the first voice, which 
nized to-be Silver’s, 
up the story, and ran 
while in a stream, only and than 
interrupted by the «

till at last, raising my head to an 
aperture among the leaves, I could 
see clear down ‘nto a little green dell 
beside the marsh, and closely set 
about with trees, where long John 
Silver and another of the crew stood 
face to face in conversation. 
The sun beat full upon them. Silver 
had thrown his hat beside him on the 
ground, and his great, smooth, blond 
face, all shining with heat, was. lifted 
to the other man’s in a kind of appeal. 
“Mate,” he was saying, “it’s be- 
cause I thinks gold dust of you—gold 
dust, and you may lay to that! If I 
hadn’t took to you like pitch, do 
you think I’d have been here a-warn- 
ing of you? All’s up—you can’t 
make nor mend; it’s to save your 
neck that I’m a-speaking, and if one 
of the wild ’uns knew it, where ’d I 
be, Tom—now, tell me, where ’ud 
Ibe?” 
“Silver,” said the other man— 
and I observed he was not only red 
in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a 
crow, and his voice shook, too, like 
a taut rope—‘‘Silver,”’ says he, “you're 
old, and you’re honest, or has the 
name for it; and you’ve money, too, 
which lots of poor sailors hasn’t; 
and you’re brave, or I’m mistook. 
And will you tell me you'll let your- 
self be led away with that kind of a 
mess of swabs? not you! As sure as 
God sees me, I’d sooner lose my 
hand. If I turn agin my dooty—” 
And then all of a sudden he was 
interrupted by a noise. I had found 
one of the honest, hands—well, here, 
at that same moment, came news of | 
another. Far away out in the marsh 
there arose, all of a sudden, a sound 
like the cry of anger, then another on 
the back of it; and then one horrid, 
long-drawn scream. The rocks of the 
Spyglass reéchoed it a score of times; 
the whole troop of marsh-birds rose 
again, darkening heaven, with a simul- _ 129 
taneous whirr;. and long after that 
death yell was still ringing in my 
brain, silence had reéstablished its 
empire, and only the rustle of the 
redescending birds and the boom of 
distant surges disturbed the languor 
of the afternoon, 
Tom had leaped at the sound, like 
a horse at the spur; but Silver had 
not winked an eye. He stood where 
he was, resting lightly on his crutch, 
watching his companion like a snake 
about to spring. 50 
“John,” said the sailor, stretching | 
out his hand. 
“Hands off!” cried Silwer, leaping 
back a yard, as it seemed to me with 
the speed and security of a trained 
gymnast. 
“Hands off, if you like, John Sil- 
ver,” said the other. “It’s a black 
conscience that can make you feared 
of me. But, in heaven’s name, tell 
me what was that?” 
“That?” returned Silver, smiling 
away, but warier than ever, his eye 
a mere pin-point in his big face, but 
gleaming like a crumb of glass. 
“That! Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.” 
And at. this poor Tom flashed out 
like a hero. 
“Alan!” he cried. “Then rest his 
soul for a true seaman! And as for 
you, John Silver, long you’ve been a 
mate of mine, but you’re mate of 
mine no more. If I die like a dog, I 
die in my dooty. You’ve killed Alan, 
have you? Kill me, too, if you can. 
But I defies you.” 
And with that, this brave fellow 
turned his back directly on the cook, 
and set off walking for the beach. 
But he was not destined to go far. 
With a cry, John seized the branch of 
a tree, whipped the crutch out of his 
armpit, and sent that uncouth missile 
hurtling through the air. It struck 
poor Tom point foremost, and with 
stunning violence, right between the 70 
80 
90
-P-A-G-E-139
8 = ae) 130 
shoulders in the middle of his back. 
His hands flew up, he gave a sort of 
gasp, and fell. 
’ Whether he were injured much or 
little, none could ever tell. Like 
enough, to judge from the sound, his 
back was‘ broken on the spot. But 
he had no time given him to recover. 
Silver, agile as a monkey, even with- 
out leg or crutch, was on the top of him 
next moment, and had twice buried 
his knife up to the hilt in that de- 
fenseless body. From my place of 
ambush, I could hear him pant 
aloud as he struck the blows. 
I do not know what it rightly is to 
faint, but I do know that for the 
next little while the whole world 
swam away from, before me in a 
whirling mist; Silver, and the birds, 
and the tall Spyglass’ hilltop, going 
round and round topsy-turvy before 
my eyes, and all manner of bells 
ringing and distant voices shouting 
in my ear. 
When I came again to myself, the 
monster had pulled himself together, 
his crutch under his arm, his hat 
upon his head. Just before him 
Tom lay motionless upon the sward; 
but the murderer minded him not a 
whit, cleansing his bloodstained knife 
the while upon a wisp of grass. 
Everything else was unchanged, the 
sun still shining mercilessly on the 
steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle 
of the mountain, and I could scarce 
persuade myself that murder had 
been actually done, and a human life 
cruelly cut short a moment since, 
before my eyes. 
But now John put his hand into 
his pocket, brought out a whistle, and 
blew upon it several modulated blasts, 
that rang far across the heated air. 
I could not tell, of course, the mean- 
ing of the signal; but it. instantly 
awoke my fears. More men would 
be coming. I might be discovered. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
They had already slain two of 
honest people; after Tom and 4..u.., 
might not I come next? 
Instantly I began to extricate my- 
self and crawl back again, with what 
speed and silence I could manage, to 
the more open portion of the wood. 
As I did so, I could hear hails coming 
and going between the old buccaneer 
and his comrades, and this sound of 
danger lent me wings. 
As soon as I was clear of the thicket, 
I ran as I never ran before, scarce 
minding the direction of my flight, 
so long as it led me from the murderers; 
and as J ran, fear grew and grew 
upon me, until it turned into a kind 
of frenzy. 
_ Indeed, could anyone be more 
entirely lost than I? When the gun 
fired, how should I dare to go down 
to the boats among those fiends, still 
smoking from their crime? Would 
not the first of them who saw me 
wring my neck like a snipe’s? Would 
not my absence itself be an evidence 
to them of my alarm, and therefore 
of my fatal knowledge? It was all 
over, I thought. Good-by to the 
Hispaniola; good-by to the squire, 
the doctor, and the captain! There 
was nothing left for me but death 
by starvation, or death by the hands 
of the mutineers. 
All this while, as I say, I was still 
running, and without taking any 
notice, I had drawn near to the foot 
of the little hill with the two peaks, 
and had got into a part of the island 
where the live-oaks grew more widely 
apart, and seemed more like forest 
trees in their bearing and dimensions. 
Mingled with these were a few scat- 
tered pines, some fifty, some nearer 
seventy, feet high. The air, too, 
smelt more freshly than down beside 
the marsh, 
And here a fresh alarm brought me 
to a standstill with a thumping heart.

3S TREASURE ISLAND 
CHAPTER XV 
Tse Man or tHe Istanp 
From the side of the hill, which 
was here steep and stony, a spout of 
gravel was dislodged, and fell rattling 
and bounding through the trees. My 
eyes turned instinctively in that di- 
rection, and I saw a figure leap with 
great rapidity behind the trunk of a 
pine. What it was, whether bear or 
man or monkey, I could in nowise tell. 
It seemed dark and shaggy; more I 
knew not. But the terror of this 
new apparition brought me to a 
stand. 
I was now, it scemed, cut off upon 
both sides; behind me the murderers, 
before me this lurking nondescript. 
And immediately I began to prefer 
* the dangers that I knew to those I 8 23 és knew not. Silver himself appeared 
less terrible in contrast with this 
creature of the woods, and I turned 
on my heel, and, looking sharply 
behind me over my shoulder, began 
to retrace my steps in the direction 
of the boats. 
Instantly the figure reappeared, and 
making a wide circuit, began to head 
me off. I was tired, at any rate; 
but had I been as fresh as when I 
rose, I could see .it was in vain for 
me to contend in speed with such an 
adversary. From trunk to trunk the 
creature flitted like a deer, running 
manlike on two legs, but unlike any 
man that I have ever seen, stooping 
almost double as it ran. Yet a man 
it was; I could no longer be in doubt 
about that. 
I began to recall what I had heard 
of cannibals. I was within an ace 
of calling for help. But the mere 
fact that he was a man, however 
wild, had somewhat reassured me, 
and my fear of Silver began to revive 
in proportion. I stood still, there- 
fore, and cast about for some method. 181 
of escape; and as I was so thinking, 
the recollection of my pistol flashed 
into my mind. As soon as I remem- 
bered I was not defenseless, courage 
glowed again in my heart; ,and I set 
my face resolutely for this man of the 
island, and walked briskly toward him. 
He was concealed by this time, 
behind another tree trunk; but he 
must have been watching me closely, 
for as soon as I began to move in his 
direction, he reappeared and took a 
step to meet me. Then he hesitated, 
drew back, came forward again, and 
at last, to my wonder and confusion, 
threw himself on his knees and held 
out his clasped hands in supplication. 
At that I once more stopped. 
“Who are you?” I asked. 
“Ben Gunn,” he answered, and his 
voice sounded hoarse and awkward, 
like a rusty lock. “I’m poor Ben 
Gunn, I am; and I haven’t spoke with 
a Christian these three years.” 
I could now see that he was a white 
man like myself, and that his features 
were even pleasing. His skin, wher- 
ever it was exposed, was burnt by the 
sun; even his lips were black; and his 
‘fair eyes looked quite startling in’ so 
dark a face. Of all the beggar-men 
that I have seen or fancied, he was 
the chief for raggedness. He was 
clothed with tatters of old ship’s can- 
vas and old sea cloth; and this ex- 
traordinary patchwork was all held 
together by a system of the most 
various and incongruous fastenings, 
brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops 
of tarry gaskin. About his waist he 
wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, 
which was the one thing solid in his 
whole accouterment. 
“Three years!” I cried. 
you shipwrecked?” 
“Nay, mate,” said he—“marooned.” 
I had heard the word, and I knew “Were

seams. 60

it ‘stood for a horrible kind of punish- 
ment common enough among the 
buccaneers, in which the offender is 
put ashore with a little powder and- 
shot, and left behind on some desolate 
and distant island. 
“Marooned three years agone,” he 
continued, “and lived on goats since 
then, and berries, and oysters. Wher- 
ever a man is, says I, a man can do 
for himself. But, mate, my heart is 
sore for Christian diet. You mightn’t 
happen to have a piece of cheese 
about you, now? No? Well, many’s 
the long night I’ve dreamed of cheese 
—toasted, mostly—and woke up again, 
and here I were.” 
“Tf ever I can get aboard again,” 
said I, “you shall have cheese by the 
stone.” 
All this time he had been feeling 
the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my 
hands, looking at my boots, and 
generally, in the intervals of his 
speech, showing a childish pleasure in 
the presence of a fellow creature. But 
at my last words he perked up into a 
kind of ‘startled slyness. 
“If ever you can get aboard again, 
says you?” he repeated. “Why, now, 
who’s to hinder you?” 
“Not you, I know,” was my reply. 
“And right you was,” he cried. 
“Now you—what do you call your- 
self, mate?” 
“Jim,” I told him. 
“Jim, Jim,” says he, quite pleased 
appareritly. “Well, now, Jim, I’ve 
lived that rough as you’d be ashamed 
to hear of. Now, for instance, you 
wouldn’t think I had had a pious 
mother—to look at me?’’ he asked. 
“Why, no, not in particular,” I 
answered. 
“Ah, well,” said he, “but I had— 
remarkable pious. And I was a civil, 
pious boy, and could rattle off my 
catechism that fast, as you couldn’t 
tell one word from another. And ‘blessed gravestones! THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE

lowering his voice to a whisper—“I’m 
tich.” 
I now felt sure that the poor fellow 
had gone crazy in his solitude, and I 
suppose I must have shown the feel- 
ing in my face; for he repeated the 7 
statement hotly: 
“Rich! rich! I says. And Ill tell 
you what: I'll make a man of you,

And at this there came suddenly a 
lowering shadow over his face, and he 
tightened his grasp upon my hand, 
and raised a forefinger threateningly s 
before my eyes. 
“Now, Jim, you tell me true: that 
ain’t Flint’s ship?” he asked. 
At this I had a happy inspiration. 
I began to believe that I had found 
an ally, and I answered him at once. 
“It’s not Flint’s ship, and Flint is 
dead; but I'll tell you true, as you 
ask me—there are some of Flint’s 
hands aboard; worse luck for the rest 
of us.” 
“Not a man—with one—leg?” he 
gasped. 
“Silver?” I asked. 
“Ah, Silver!” says he; “that were 
his name.”

“He’s the cook; and the ringleader, 
too.” 
He was still holding me by the 
wrist, and at that he gave it quite a 
wring. 
“Tf you was sent by Long John,” he 
said, “I’m as good as pork, and I 
know it. But where was you, do you 
suppose?” 
I had made my mind up in a mo- 
ment, and by way of answer told him 
the whole story of our voyage, and 
the, predicament in which we found 
ourselves. He heard me with the 
keenest interest, and when I had done 
he patted me on the head. 
“You're a good lad, Jim,”’ be said, 
“and you're all in a clove hitch, ain’t 
you? Well, you just put your trust 
in Ben Gunn—Ben Gunn’s the man 
to do it. Would you think it likely, 
now, that your squire would prove a 
liberal-minded one, in case of help— 
him being in a clove hitch, as you 
remark?” 
I told him the squire was the most 
liberal of men. 
“Aye, but you see,”’ returned Ben 
Gunn, “I didn’t mean giving me a 
gate to keep, and a shuit of livery 
clothes, and such; that’s not my mark, 
Jim. What I mean is, would he be 
likely. to come down to the toon of, 
say one thousand pounds out of 
money that’s as good as a man’s own 
already?” 
“IT am sure he would,” said I. 
it was, all hands were to share.” 
“And a passage home?” he added, 
with a look of great shrewdness. 
“Why,” I. cried, “the squire’s a 
gentleman. And, besides, if we got 
rid of the others, we should want you 
to help work the vessel home.” 
“Ah,” said he, “so you would.” 
And he seemed very much relieved. 
“Now, I'll tell you what,” he went “As

on. “So much I'll tell you, and no 
more. I were in Flint’s ship when he 
buried the treasure; he and six along 
—six strong seamen. They were 
ashore nigh on a week, and us stand- 
ing off and on in the old Walrus. 
One fine day up went the signal, and , 
here.come Flint by himself in a little 
boat, and his head done up in a blue 
scarf. The sun was getting up, and 
mortal white he looked about the cut- 
water, But, there he was, you mind, 
and the six all dead—dead and buried. 
How he done it, not a man aboard us 
could make out. It was battle, 
murder, and sudden death, leastways 
—him against six. Billy Bones was 
the mate; Long John, he was quarter- 
master; and they asked him where the 
treasure was. “Ah,” says he, ‘you can 
go ashore, if you like, and stay,’ he 
says; ‘but as for the ship, she’ll beat 
up for more, by thunder! That’s 
what he said. 
“Well, I was in another ship three 
years back, and we sighted this island. 
‘Boys,’ said I, ‘here’s Flint’s treasure; 
‘let’s land and find it.’ The cap’n was 
displeased at that; but my messmates 
were all of a mind, and landed. 
Twelve days they looked for it, and 
every day they had the worst word 
for me, until one fine morning all 
hands went aboard. ‘As for you, 
Benjamin Gunn,’ says they, ‘here’s a 
musket,’ they says, ‘and a spade, and 
pickax. You can stay here, and find 
Flint’s money for yourself,’ they says. 
“Well, Jim, three years have I been 
here, and not a bite of Christian diet 
from that day to this. But now, you 
look here; look at me. Do I look like’ 
a man before the mast? No, says 
you. Nor I wasn’t, neither, I says.” 
And with that he winked and 
pinched me hard. 
“Just you mention them words to

your squire, Jim”—he went on: “Nor 
he weren’t, neither—that’s the words. 
Three years he were the man of this 
island, light and dark, fair and rain; 
and sometimes he would, maybe, think 
upon a prayer (says you), and some- 
times he would, maybe, think of his 
old mother, so be as she’s alive (you'll 
say); but the most part of Gunn’s 
time (this is what you'll say)—the 
most part of his time was took up 
with another matter. And then you'll 
give him a nip, like I do.” 
And he pinched me again in the 
most confidential manner. 
“Then,” he continued—‘“‘then you'll 
up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a 
good man (you'll say), and he puts a 
precious sight more confidence—a 
precious sight, mind that—in a gen’le- 
man born than in these gen’lemen 
of fortune, having been one hisself.” 
“Well,” I said, “I don’t understand 
one word that you’ve been saying. 
But that’s neither here nor there; for 
how am I to get on board?” 
“Ah,” said he, “that’s the hitch, 
for sure. Well, there’s my boat, that‘ 
I made with my two hands. I keep 
her under the white rock. If the 
worst come to the worst, we might 
try that after dark. Hi!’ he broke 
ut, “what’s that?” 
For just then, although the sun 
had still an hour or two to run, all THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
the echoes of the island awoke and 
bellowed to the thunder of a. cannon. 
“They have begun to fight!” I 
cried. “Follow me.” 
And I began to run toward the 
anchorage, my terrors all forgotten; 
while, close at my side, the marooned 
man in his goatskins trotted easily 
and lightly. 
“Left, left,” says he; “keep to your 
left hand, mate Jim! Under the trees 
with you! There’s where I killed my 
first goat. They don’t come down 
here now; they’re all mastheaded on 
them mountings for the fear of Ben- 
jamin Gunn. Ah! and there’s the 
cetemery’’—cemetery, he must have 
meant. “You see the mounds? I 
come here and prayed, nows and 
thens, when I thought maybe a Sun- 
day would be about doo. It weren’t 
quite a chapel, but it seemed more 
solemn-like; and then, says you, Ben 
Gunn was shorthanded—no chapling, 
nor so much as a Bible and a flag, 
you says.” 
So he kept talking as I ran, neither 
expecting nor receiving any answer. 
The cannon-shot was followed, after 
a considerable interval, by a volley 
of small arms. 
Another pause, and then, not a 
quarter of a mile in front of me, I 
beheld the Union Jack flutter in the 
air above a wood.

THE STOCKADE 
CHAPTER XVI 
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: 
How rue Sarp Was ABANDONED 
It was about half-past one—three 
bells in the sea. phrase—that the two 
boats went ashore from the Hispaniola. 
The captain, the squire, and I were 
talking matters ®ver in the cabin. 
Had there been a breath of wind we 
should have fallen on the six mutineers 
who were left aboard with us, slipped 
our cable, and away to sea. But the 
wind was wanting; and, to complete 
our helplessness, down came Hunter 
with the news that Jim Hawkins had 
slipped into a boat and was gone 
ashore with the rest. 
It never occurred to us to doubt 
Jim Hawkins; but we were alarmed 
for his safety. With the men in the 
temper they were in, it seemed an 
even chance if we should see the lad 
again. We ran on deck. The pitch 
was bubbling in the seams; the nasty 
stench of the place turned me sick; 
if ever a man smelled fever and 
dysentery, it was in that abominable 
anchorage. The six scoundrels were 
sitting grumbling under a sail in the 
forecastle; ashore we could see the 
gigs made fast, and a man sitting in 
each, hard by where the river runs in. 
One of them was whistling “Lilli- 
bullero.” 
Waiting was a strain; and it was 
decided that Hunter and I should go 
ashore with the jolly-boat, in quest 
of information. 
The gigs had leaned to their right; 
but Hunter and I pulled straight in, 
in the direction of the stockade upon 
80. Lillibullero, a very popular song, the tune for which 
was asa Ty march, . the chart. The two who were left 
guarding their boats seemed in a 
bustle at our appearance; “Lilli- 
bullero” stopped off, and I could see 
the pair discussing what they ought 
todo. Had they gone and told Silver, 
all might have turned out differently; 
but they had their orders, I suppose, 
and decided to sit quietly where they 
were and hark back again to “Lilli- 
bullero.” 
There was a slight bend in the 
coast, and I steered so as to put it 
between us; even before we landed we 
had thus lost sight of the gigs. I 
jumped out, and came as near run- 
ning as I durst, with a big silk hand- 
kerchief under my hat for coolness’ 
sake, and a brace of pistols ready 
primed for safety. 
I had not gone a hundred yards 
when I came on the stockade. 
This was: how it was: a spring of 
clear water rose almost at the top of 
a knoll. Well, on the knoll, and 
inclosing the spring, they had clapped 
a stout log-house, fit to hold two 
score people on a pinch, and loop- 
holed for musketry on every side. 
All round this they had cleared a wide 
space, and then the thing was com- 
pleted by a paling six feet high, with- 
out door or opening, too strong to 
pull down without time and labor, 
and too open to shelter the besiegers. 
The people in the log-house had them 
in every way; they stood quiet in 
shelter and shot the others like 
partridges. All they wanted was a 
good watch and food; for, short of a 
complete surprise, they might have 
held the place against a regiment. 
What particularly took my fancy 
was the spring. For, though we had 
a good enough place of it in the cabin
-P-A-G-E-145
10 136 
of the Hispaniola, with plenty of arms 
and ammunition, and things to eat, 
and excellent wines, there had been 
one thing overlooked—we had no 
water. I was thinking this over, 
when there came ringing over the 
island the cry of a man at the point 
of death. I was not new to violent 
death-—I have served his Royal High- 
ness the Duke of Cumberland, and 
got a wound myself at Fontenoy— 
but I knew my pulse went dot and 
carry one. “Jim Hawkins is gone,” 
was my first thought. 
It is Something to have been an 
old soldier, but more still to have been 
a doctor. There is no time to dilly- 
dally in our work. And so now I 
made up my mind instantly, and with 
no time lost returned to the shore, 
and jumped on board the jolly-boat. 
By good fortune Hunter pulled a 
good oar. We made the water fly; 
and the boat was soon alongside, and 
T aboard the schooner. 
I found them all shaken, as was 
‘ natural. The squire was sitting down, 
"30 as white as a sheet, thinking of the 
harm he had led us to, the good soul! 
and one of the six forecastle hands 
was little better. 
“There’s a man,” says Captain 
Smollett, and nodding toward him, 
“new to this work. He came nigh- 
hand fainting, doctor, when he heard 
the cry. Another touch of the rudder 
and that man would join us.” 
I told my plan to the captain, and 
between us we settled on the details 
of its accomplishment. 
We put old Redruth in the gallery 
between the cabin and the fore- 
castle, with three or four loaded 
muskets. and a mattress for protec- 
tion. Hunter brought the boat round 
under the stern-port, and Joyce and 
I set to work loading her with powder 
10, Duke of Cumberland, a son of King George IT, who 
commanded the British at the Battle of Fontenoy in Bel- 
gium, 1745. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of 
pork, a cask of cognac, and my in- 
valuable medicine chest. 
In the meantime, the squire and the 
captain stayed on deck, and the 
latter hailed the coxswain, who was 
the principal man aboard. 
“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are 
two of us with a brace of pistols each. 
If any one of you six make a signal of 
any description, that man’s dead.” 
They were a good deal taken aback; 
and, after a little consultation, one 
and all tumbled doWn the fore com- 
panion, thinking, no doubt, to take us 
on the rear. But when they saw 
Redruth waiting for them in the 
sparred gallery, they went about ship 
at once, and a head popped out again 
on deck. . 
“Down, dog!” cries the captain. 
And the head popped back again; 
and we heard no more, for the time, 
of these six very fainthearted seamen. 
By this time, tumbling things in as 
they came, we had the jolly-boat 
loaded as much as we dared. Joyce 
and I got out through the stern-port, 
and we made for shore again, as fast 
as oars could take us. 
This second trip fairly aroused the 
watchers along the shore. “Lilli- 
bullero” was dropped again; and just 
“before we lost sight of them behind 
the little point, one of them whipped 
ashore and disappeared. I had half a 
mind to change my plan and destroy 
the boats, but I feared that Silver and 
the others might be close at hand, 
and all might very well be lost by 
trying for too much. 
We had soon touched land in the 
same place as before, and set to 
provision the block-house. All three 
made the first journey, heavily laden, 
and tossed our stores over the palisade. 
Then, leaving Joyce to guard them— 
one man, to be sure, but with half a 
dozen muskets—Hunter and I re- 50 
70
-P-A-G-E-146
TREASURE ISLAND 
turned to the jolly-boat and loaded 
ourselves once more. So we pro- 
ceeded without pausing to take breath, 
till the whole cargo was bestowed, 
when the two servants took up their 
position in the block-house, and I, with 
all my power, sculled back to the 
Hispaniola. 
That we should have risked a sec- 
ond boat load seems more daring than 
it really was. They had the advan- 
tage of numbers, of course, but we 
had the advantage of arms. Not one 
of the men ashore had a musket, and 
before they could get within range 
for pistol shooting, we flattered our- 
selves we should be able to give a. 
good account of a half-dozen at least. 
The squire was waiting for me at 
the stern window, all his faintness 
gone from him. He caught the painter 
and made it fast, and we fell to load- 
ing the boat for our very lives. Pork, 
powder, and biscuit was the cargo, 
with only a musket and a cutlass 
apiece for the squire and me and 
Redruth and the captain. The rest 
of the arms and powder we dropped 
overboard in two fathoms and a half 
of water, so that we could see the 
bright steel shining far below us in 
the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom. 
By this time the tide was beginning 
to ebb, and the ship was swinging 
round to her artchor. Voices were 
heard faintly halloaing in the direc- 
tion of the two gigs; and though this 
reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, 
who were well to the eastward, it 
warned our party to be off. 
Redruth retreated from his place 
in the gallery, and dropped into the 
boat, which we then brought round 
to the ship’s counter, to be handier for 
Captain Smollett. 
“Now, men,” said he, “do you hear 
me?” 
There was no answer from the fore- 
castle. 
i 137 
“It’s to you, Abraham Gray—it’s 
to you I am speaking.” 
Still no reply. 
“Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, a 
little louder, “I am leaving this ship, 
and I order you to follow your cap- 
tain. I know you are a good man at 
bottom, and I daresay not one of the 
lot of you’s as bad as he makes out. 
I have my watch here in my hand; 
I give you thirty seconds to join me 
in.” 
There was a pause. ; 
“Come, my fine fellow,” continued 
the captain, “don’t hang so long in 
stays. I’m risking my life, and the 
lives of these good gentlemen, every 
second.” 
There was a sudden scuffle, a sound 
of blows, and out burst Abraham Gray 
with a knife-cut on the side of the 
cheek, and came running to the cap- 
tain, like a dog to the whistle. 
“T’m with you, sir,” said he. 50 
7] 
And the next moment he and the © 
captain had dropped aboard of us, 
and we had shoved off and given way. 
We were clear out of the ship; but 
not yet ashore in our stockade. 
CHAPTER XVII 
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: 
Tur Jouiy-Boat’s Last Tre 
This fifth trip was quite different 
from any of the others. In the first 
place, the little gallipot of a boat 
that we were in was gravely over- 
loaded. - Five grown men, and three 
of them—Trelawney, Redruth, and 
the captain—over six feet high, was 
already more than she was meant to 
carry. Add to that the powder, pork, 
and bread-bags. The gunwale was 
lipping astern. Several times we 
shipped a little water, and my breeches 
and the tails of my coat were all soak- 80

ing wet before we had gone a hundred 
yards. 
The captain made us trim the boat, 
and we got her to lie a little more 
evenly. All the same, we were afraid 
to breathe. : 
In the second place, the ebb was now 
making—a strong, rippling current 
running westward through the basin, 
and then south’ard and seaward down 
the straits by which we had entered 
in the morning. Even the ripples 
were a danger to our overloaded craft; 
but the worst of it was that we were 
swept out of our true course, and away 
from our proper landing-place behind 
the point. If we let the current have - 
its way we should come ashore beside 
the gigs, where the pirates might ap- 
pear at any moment. 
“T cannot keep her head for the 
stockade, sir,” said I to the captain. 
I was steering, while he and Redruth, 
two fresh men, were at the oars. ““The 
tide keeps washing her down. Could 
you pull a little stronger?” 
“Not without swamping the boat,” 
said he. “You must bear up, sir, if 
you: please—bear up until you see 
you’re gaining.” 
I tried, and found by experiment 
that the tide kept sweeping us west- 
ward until I had laid her head due 
east, or just: about right angles to the 
way we ought to go. 
“We'll never get ashore at this 
rate,” said I. 
“Tf it’s the only course that we can 
lie, sir, we must even lie it,” returned 
the captain. “We must keep up- 
stream. You see, sir,” he went on, 
“4f once we dropped to leeward of the 
landing-place, it’s hard to say where 
we should get ashore, besides the 
chance of being boarded by the gigs; 
whereas, the way we go the current 
must slacken, and then we can dodge 
back along the shore.” 
“The current’s less a’ready, sir,” THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
said the man Gray, who was sitting 
in. the fore-sheets; “you can ease her 
off a bit.” 
“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite 
as if nothing had happened; for we 
had all quietly made up our minds to 
treat him like one of ourselves. 
Suddenly the captain spoke’ up 
again, and I thought his voice was a 
little changed. “The gun!” said he. 
“T have thought of that,” said I, for 60 
I made sure he was thinking of a 
bombardment of the fort. “They 
could never get the gun ashore, and 
if they did, they could never haul it 
through the woods.” 
“Look astern, doctor,” replied the 
captain. 
We had entirely forgotten the long 
nine; and there, to our horror, were 
the five rogues busy about her, get- 7 
ting off her jacket, as they called the 
stout tarpaulin cover under which 
she sailed. Not only that, but it 
flashed into my mind at the same 
moment that the round-shot and the 
powder for the gun had been left be- 
hind, and a stroke with an ax would 
put it all into the possession of the 
evil ones aboard. 
“Jsrael was Flint’s gunner,” said 80 
Gray, hoarsely. 
At any risk, we put the boat’s head 
direct for the landing-place.. By this 
time we had got so far out of the run 
of the current that we kept steerage 
way even at our necessarily gentle 
rate of rowing, and I could keep her. 
steady for the goal. But the worst 
of it was that, with the course I now 
held, we turned our broadside instead 9 
of our stern to the Hispaniola, and 
offered a target like a barn door. 
I could hear, as well as see, that 
brandy-faced rascal, Israel Hands, 
plumping down a round-shot on the 
deck. 
“Who's the best shot?” asked the 
captain.
-P-A-G-E-148
S by & 2 s TREASURE ISLAND 
“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” 
said I, 
“Mr. Trelawney, will you please 
pick me off one of these men, sir? 
Hands, if possible,” said the captain. 
Trelawney was as cool as steel. 
He looked to the priming of his gun. 
“Now,” cried the captain, “easy 
with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp 
the boat. All hands stand by to trim 
her when he aims.” 
The squire raised his gun, the row- 
ing ceased, and we leaned over to the 
other side to keep the balancé, and 
all was so nicely contrived that we 
did not ship a drop. 
They had the gun, by this time, 
slewed round upon the swivel, and 
Hands, who was at the muzzle with 
the rammer, was, in consequence, the 
most exposed. However, we had no 
luck; .for just as Trelawney fired, 
down he stooped, the ball whistled 
over him, and it was one of the other 
four who fell. 
The cry he gave was echoed, not 
only by his companions on board, but 
by a great number of voices from the 
shore, and looking in that direction I 
saw'the other pirates trooping out 
from among the trees and tumbling 
into their places in the boats. 
“Here come the gigs, sir,” said I. 
“Give way, then,” cried the cap- 
tain. “We mustn’t mind if we swamp 
her now. If we can’t get ashore, all’s up.” 
“Only one of the gigs is being 
manned, sir,” I added, “the crew of 
the other most likely going round by 
shore to cut us off.” 
“They'll have a hot run, sir,” re- 
turned the captain. “Jack ashore, 
you know. It’s not them I mind; 
it’s the round-shot. Carpet bowls! 
My lady’s maid couldn’t miss. Tell 
us, squire, when you see the match, 
and we'll hold water.” 
45. carpet bowls, very easy, like bowling on a carpet. In the meanwhile we had been mak- 
ing headway at a good pace for a boat 
so overloaded, and we had shipped but 
little water.in the process. We were 
now close in; thirty or forty strokes 
and we should beach her; for the 
ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt 
of sand below the clustering trees. 
The gig was no longer to be feared; 
the little point had already concealed 
it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which 
had so cruelly delayed us, was now 
making reparation, and delaying our 
assailants. The one source of danger 
was the gun. 
“Tf I durst,” said the captain, “I'd 
stop and pick off another man.” 
But it was plain that they meant 
nothing should delay their shot. They 
had never so much as looked at their 
fallen comrade, though he was not 
dead, and I could see him trying to 
crawl away. : 
“Ready!” cried the squire. 
“Hold!” cried the captain, quick as 
an echo. 
And he and Redruth backed with 
a great heave that sent her stern 
bodily under water. The report fell 
in at the same instant of time. This 
was the first that Jim had heard, the 
sound of the squire’s shot not having 
reached him. Where the ball passed, 
not one of us precisely knew; but I 
fancy it must have been over our 
heads, and that the wind of it may 
have contributed to our disaster. 
At any rate, the boat sank by the 
stern, quite gently, in three feet of 
water, leaving the captain and my- 
self, facing each other, on our feet. 
The other three took complete headers, 
and came up again, drenched and 
bubbling. 
So far there was no great harm. No 
lives were lost, and we could wade 
ashore in safety. But there were all 
our stores at the bottom, and, to make 
things worse, only two guns out of 139 °

five remained in a state for service. 
Mine I had snatched from my knees 
and held over my head, by a sort of 
instinct. As for the captain, he had 
carried his over his shoulder by a 
bandoleer, and, like a wise man, lock 
uppermost. The other three had gone 
down with the boat. 
To add to our concern, we heard 
10 voices already drawing near us in the 
woods along shore; and we had not 
only the danger of being cut off from 
the stockade in our half-crippled state, 
but the fear before us whether, if. 
Hunter and Joyce were attacked by 
half a dozen, they would have the 
sense and conduct to stand firm. 
Hunter was steady, that we knew; 
Joyce was a doubtful case—a pleasant, 
20 polite man for a valet, and to brush 
one’s clothes, but not entirely fitted 
for a man of war. 
With all this in our minds, we waded 
ashore as fast as we could, leaving 
behind us the poor jolly-boat, and a 
good half of all our powder and pro- 
visions. 
CHAPTER XVIII 
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: 
Enp or Tue First Day’s Ficutine 
We made our best speed across the 
strip of wood that now divided us 
30 from the stockade; and at every step 
we took, the voices of the buccaneers 
rang nearer. Soon we could hear their 
footfalls as they ran, and the cracking 
of the branches as they breasted across 
a bit of thicket. 
I began to see we should have a 
brush for it in earnest, and looked to 
my priming. 
“Captain,” said I, “Trelawney is 
40 the dead shot. Give him your gun; 
his own is useless.” 
They exchanged guns, and Tre- 
lawney, silent and cool as he had been THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
since the beginning of the bustle, hung 
a moment on his heel to see that all 
was fit for service. At the same time, 
observing Gray to be unarmed, I 
handed him my cutlass. It did all 
our hearts good to see him spit in his’ 
hand, knit his brows, and make the 50 
blade sing through the air: It was 
plain from every line of his body that 
our new hand was worth his salt. 
Forty paces farther we came to the 
edge of the wood and saw the stockade 
in front of us. We struck the enclos- 
ure about the middle of the south side, 
and, almost at the same time, seven 
mutineers—Job Anderson, the boat- 
swain, at their head—appeared in full 60 
ery at the southwestern corner. 
They paused, as if taken aback; 
and before they recovered, not only 
the squire and I, but Hunter and 
Joyce from the block-house, had time 
to fire. The four shots came in 
rather a scattering volley; but they 
did the business: one of the enemy 
actually fell, and the rest, without 
hesitation, turned and plunged into 70 
the trees. 
After reloading, we walked down 
the outside of the palisade to see to 
the fallen enemy. He was stone dead 
—shot through the heart. 
We began to rejoice over our good 
success, when just at that moment 
a pistol cracked ‘in the bush, a ball 
whistled close past my ear, and poor 
Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his s 
length on the ground. Both the 
squire and I returned the shot; but as 
we had nothing to aim at, it is prob- 
able we only wasted powder. Then 
we reloaded, and turned our attention 
to poor Tom. 
The captain and Gray were already 
examining him; and I saw with half 
an eye that all was over. 
I believe the readiness of our return 90 
volley had scattered the mutineers 
once more, for we were suffered with-
-P-A-G-E-150
TREASURE ISLAND © 
out further molestation to get the poor 
old gamekeeper hoisted over the 
stockade, and carried, groaning and 
bleeding, into the log-house. 
Poor old fellow, he had not uttered 
ae word of surprise, complaint, fear, 
t even acquiescence, from the very 
eginning of our troubles till now, 
then we had laid him down in the 
»g-house to die. He had lain like 
Trojan behind his mattress in the 
allery; he had followed every order 
ilently, doggedly, and well; he was 
he oldest of our party by a score of 
ears; and now, sullen, old, serviceable 
ervant, it was he that was to die. 
The squire dropped down beside 
im on his knees and kissed his hand, 
tying like a child. 
“Be I going, doctor?” he asked. 
“Tom, my man,” said I, “you’re go- 
ng home.” 
“TI wish I had had a lick at them with 
‘he gun first,” he replied. 
“Tom,” said the squire, 
‘orgive me, won’t you?” 
“Would that be respectful like, 
‘rom me to you, squire?” was the 
answer. “‘Howsoever, so be it, amen!” 
After a little while of silence, he 
said he thought somebody might read a 
prayer. “It’s the custom, sir,” he add- 
ed, apologetically. And not long after, 
without another word, he passed away. 
In the meantime the captain, whom 
I had observed to be wonderfully 
swollen about the chest and pockets, 
had turned out a great many various 
stores—the British colors, a Bible, a 
coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log- 
book, and pounds of tobacco. He 
had found a longish fir-tree lying 
felled and trimmed in the enclosure, 
and, with the help of Hunter, he had 
set it up at the corner of the log-house 
where the trunks crossed and made 
an angle. Then, climbing on the 
roof, he had with his own hand bent 
and run up the colors. “say you 141 
This seemed mightily to relieve so 
him. He reéntered the log-house, and 
set about counting up the stores, as 
if nothing else existed. But he ‘had 
an eye on Tom’s passage for all that; 
and as soon as all was over, he came 
forward with another flag, and rev- 
erently spread it on the body. 
‘Don’t you take on, sir,” 
shaking the squire’s hand. 
“All’s well with him; no fear for a 
hand that’s been shot down in his 
duty to captain and owner. It mayn’t 
be good divinity, but it’s a fact.” 
Then he pulled me aside. 
“Dr. Livesey,” he said, “in how 
many weeks do you and squire expect 
the consort?” 
I told him it was a question, not of 
weeks, but of months; that if we 
were not back by the end of August, 70 
Blandly was to send to find us; but 
neither sooner nor later. “You can 
calculate for yourself,” I said. 
“Why, yes,” returned the captain, 
scratching his head, “and making a 
large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of 
Providence, I should say we were 
pretty close hauled.” 
“How do you mean?” I asked. 
“Tt’s a pity, sir, we lost that second so 
load. That’s what I mean,” replied 
the captain. “As for powder and shot, 
we'll do. But the rations are short, 
very short—so short, Dr. Livesey, 
that we're, perhaps, as well without 
that extra mouth.” And he pointed 
to the dead body under the flag. 
Just then, with a roar and a whistle, 
a round-shot passed high above the 
roof of the log-house and pluriped far 90 
beyond us in the wood. 
“Oho!” said the captain. “Blaze 
away! You’ve little enough powder 
already, my lads.” 
At the second trial, the aim was 
better, and the ball descended inside 
the stockade, scattering a cloud of 
sand, but doing no further damage. he said,

‘ 
“Captain,” said the squire, “the 
house is quite invisible from the ship. 
Tt must be the flag they are aiming at. 
Would it not be wiser to take it in?” 
“Strike my colors!” cried the cap- 
tain. “No, sir, not I’; and, as soon 
as he said the words, { think we all 
agreed with him. For it was not only 
a piece of stout, seamanly, good feel- 
ing; it was good policy -besides, and 
showed our enemies that we despised 
their cannonade. 
All through the evening they kept 
thundering away. Ball after ball 
flew over or fell short, or kicked up 
the sand in the enclosure; but they 
had to fire so high that the shot fell 
dead and buried itself in the soft 
sand. We had no ricochet to fear; 
and though one popped in through 
the roof of the log-house and out again 
through the floor, we soon got used. 
to that sort of horseplay, and minded 
it no more than cricket. 
“There is one thing good about all 
this,” observed the captain; “the 
wood in front of us is likely clear. 
The ebb has made a good while; -our 
stores should be uncovered. Volun- 
teers to go and bring in pork.” 
Gray and Hunter were the first to 
come forward. Well armed, they 
stole out of the stockade; but it 
proved a useless mission. The mu- 
tineers were bolder than we fancied, 
or they put more trust in Israel’s 
gunnery. For four or five of them 
were busy carrying off our stores, and 
wading out with them to one of the 
gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar 
or so to hold her steady against the 
current. Silver was in the stern- 
sheets in command; and every man 
of them was now provided with a 
musket from some secret magazine 
of their own. 
The captain sat down to his log, and 
here is the beginning of the entry: 
“Alexander Smollett, master; David THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
Livesey, ship’s doctor; Abraham Gray, #| 
carpenter’s mate; John Trelawney, 
owner; John Hunter and Richard 
Joyce, owner’s servants, landsmen— 
being all that is left faithful of the 
ship’s company—with stores for ten 
days at short rations, came ashore 
this day, and flew British colors on 
the log-house in Treasure Island. 
Thomas Redruth, owner’s servant, | 
landsman, shot by the mutineers; « 
James Hawkins, cabin-boy—” 
And at the same time I was won- 
dering over poor Jim Hawkins’s fate. 
A hail on the land side. 
“Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, 
who was on guard. 
“Doctor! squire! captain! Hullo, 
Hunter, is that you?” came the cries. 
And I ran to the door in time to see 
Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come 17 
climbing over the stockade. 
CHAPTER XIX 
NARRATIVE RESUMED BY JIM HAWKINS: 
Tur GapRIson IN THE STOCKADE 
As soon as Ben Gunn saw the colors 
he came to a halt, stopped me by the 
arm, and sat down. 
“Now,” said he, 
friends, sure enough.” 
“Far more likely it’s the mutineers,” 
I answered. 
“That!” he cried. “Why, in a 
place like this, where nobody puts in # 
but gen’lemen of fortune, Silver would 
fly the Jolly Roger, you don’t make 
no doubt of that. No; that’s your 
friends. ‘There’s been blows, too, and 
I reckon your friends has had the 
best of it; and here they are ashore 
in the old stockade, as was made years 
and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was 
the man to have a headpiece, was 
Flint! Barring rum, his match were 
never seen. He were afraid of none, 
82, Jolly Roger, the black pirate flag. ‘there’s your

TREASURE ISLAND |. 
not he; on’y Silver—Silver was that 
genteel!’ 
“Well,” said I, “that may be so, 
and so be it; all the more reason that 
Ishould hurry on and join my friends.” 
“Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not 
you. You're a good boy, or I’m mis- 
took; but you’re on’y a boy, all told. 
Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn’t 
0 bring me there, where you’re going— 
not rum wouldn’t, till I see your born 
gen’leman, and gets it on his word of 
‘honor, And you won’t forget my 
words: ‘A precious sight (that’s what 
you'll say), a precious sight more con- 
fidence’—and then nips him.” 
And he pinched me the third time 
with the same air of cleverness. 
“And when Ben Gunn is wanted, 
20 you know where to find him, Jim. 
Just where you found him today. 
And him that comes is to have a white 
thing in his hand; and he’s to come 
alone. Oh! and you'll say this: “Ben 
Gunn,’ says you, ‘has reasons of his 
own,’ ” Y 
“Well,” said I, “I believe I under- 
_ stand. You have something to pro- 
| pose, and you wish to see the squire 
30 or the doctor; and you're to be found 
where I found you. Is that all?” 
“And when? says you,” he added. 
“Why, from about noon observation 
to about six bells.” 
“Good,” said I, “and now may I 
go?” 
“You won’t forget?” he inquired 
' anxiously. “Precious sight, and rea- 
sons of his own, says you. Reasons 
40 of his own; that’s the mainstay; as 
between man and man. Well, then” 
—stili holding me—“I reckon you can 
go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see 
\ Silver, you wouldn’t go for to sell Ben 
Gunn? Wild horses wouldn’t draw it 
from you? No, says you. And if 
them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what 
would you say but there'd be widders 
in the morning?”   143 
Here he was interrupted by a loud 
report, and a cannon ball came tearing 
through the trees and pitched in the 
sand, not a hundred yards from where 
we two were talking. The next mo- 
ment each of us had taken to his 
heels in a different direction. ~ 50 
For a good hour to come frequent 
reports shook the island, and balls 
kept crashing through the woods. I 
moved from hiding-place to hiding- 
place, always pursued, or so it seemed 
to me, by these terrifying missiles. 
But toward the end of the bombard- 
ment, though still I durst not venture 
in the direction of the stockade, where 
the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, 
in a manner, to pluck up my heart 
again; and after a long detour to 
the east, crept.down among the shore- 
side trees. © 
The sun had just set, the sea breeze 
was rustling and tumbling in the 
woods, and ruffling the gray surface 
of the anchorage; the tide, too, was 
far out, and great tracts of sand lay 
uncovered; the air, after the heat of 
the day, chilled me through my jacket. 
The ‘Hispaniola still lay where she 
had anchored; but, sure enough, there 
was the Jolly Roger—the black flag 
of piracy—fiying from her peak. 
Even as I looked, there came another 
red flash and another report, that sent 
the echoes clattering, and’ one more 
round-shot whistled through the air. 
It was the last of the cannonade. 
I lay for some time, watching the 
bustle which succeeded the attack. 
Men were demolishing something with 
axes on the beach near the stockade; 
the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards dis- 
covered. Away, near the mouth of 
the river, a great fire was glowing 
among the trees, and between that 
point and the ship one of the gigs kept 
coming and going, the men, whom I 
had seen so gloomy, shouting at the 
oars like children. But there was a 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
144 
sound in their voices which suggested 
rum. 
At length I thought I might return 
toward the stockade. I was pretty 
far down on the low, sandy spit that 
incloses the anchorage to the east, and 
.ig joined at half-water to Skeleton 
1X 
So 
40 Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, 
I saw, some distance farther down the 
spit, and rising from among low 
bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, 
and peculiarly white in color. It 
occurred to me that this might be the 
white rock of which Ben Gunn had 
spoken, and that some day or other 
a boat might be wanted, and I should 
know where to look for one. 
Then I skirted among the woods 
until I had regained the rear, or shore- 
ward side, of the stockade, and was 
soon warmly welcomed by the faithful 
party. 
I had soon told my story, and began 
to look about me. The log-house was 
made of unsquared trunks of pine— 
roof, walls, and floor. The latter 
stood in several places as much as a 
foot or a foot and a half above the 
surface of the sand. There was a 
porch at the door, and under this porch 
the little spring welled up into an 
artificial basin of a rather odd kind— 
no other than a great ship’s kettle of 
iron, with the bottom knocked out, 
and sunk “to her bearings,” as the 
captain said, among the sand. 
Little had been left besides the 
framework of the house; but in one 
corner there was a stone slab laid 
down by way of hearth, and an old 
rusty iron basket to contain the fire. 
The slopes of the knoll and all the 
inside of the stockade had been cleared 
of timber to build the house, and we 
could see by the stumps what a fine 
and lofty grove had been destroyed. 
Most of the soil had been washed 
away or buried in drift after the re- 
moval of the trees; only where the THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
streamlet ran down from the kettle a » 
thick bed of moss and some ferns and 
little creeping bushes were still green 
among the sand. Very close around 
the stockade—too close for defense, 
they said—the wood still flourished 
high and dense, all of fir on the land 
side, but toward the sea with a large 
admixture of live-oaks. 
The cold evening breeze of which 
I have spoken, whistled through every « 
chink of the rude building, and 
sprinkled the floor with a continual’ 
rain of fine sand. There was sand in 
our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in 
our suppers, sand dancing in the 
spring at the bottom of the kettle, for 
all the world like porridge beginning 
to boil. Our chimney was a square 
hole in the roof; it was but a little part 
of the smoke that found its way out, 
and the rest eddied about the house, 
and kept us coughing and wiping 
the eye. 
Add to this that Gray, the new man, 
had his face tied up in.a bandage for 
a cut he had got in breaking away 
from the mutineers; and poor old Tom 
Redruth, still unburied, lay along the 
wall, stiff and stark, under the Union 
Jack. : a 
If we had been allowed to sit idle, 
we should all have fallen in the blues, 
but Captain Smollett was never the 
man for that. All hands were called 
up before him, and he divided us into 
watches. -The doctor, and Gray, and 
I, for one; the squire, Hunter, and 
Joyce, upon the other. Tired as we 
all were, two were sent out for fire- 
wood; two more were set to dig a % 
grave for Redruth; the doctor was 
named cook; I was put sentry at the 
door; and the captain himself went 
from one to another, keeping up our 
spirits and lending a hand wherever it 
was wanted. 
From time to time the doctor came 
to the door for a little air and to rest 
2
-P-A-G-E-154
  TREASURE ISLAND 
his eyes, which were almost smoked 
out of his head; and whenever he did 
so, he had a word for me. 
“Thateman Smollett,” he said once, 
“is a better man than I am. And 
when J say that, it means a deal, Jim.” 
Another time he came and was si- 
lent for a while. Then he put his 
head on one side, and looked at me. 
“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he 
asked. 
“TI do not know, sir,” said I. “TI 
am not very sure whether he’s sane.” 
“If there’s any doubt about the 
matter, he is,” returned the doctor. 
“A man who has been three years bit- 
ing his nails on a desert island, Jim, 
can’t expect to appear as sane as you 
or me, It doesn’t lie in human na- 
2) ture. Was it cheese you said he had 
a fancy for?” 
“Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered. 
“Well, Jim,” says he, “just see the 
good that comes of being dainty in 
your food. You’ve seen my snuff- 
box, haven’t you? And you never 
saw me take snuff; the reason being 
that in my snuff-box I carry a piece 
cf Parmesan cheese—a cheese made 
} :a in Italy, very nutritious, Well, that’s 
for Ben Gunn.” 
Before supper was eaten we buried 
eld Tom in the sand and stood round 
him for a while bareheaded in the 
breeze. A good deal of firewood had 
been got in, but not enough for the 
eaptain’s fancy; and he shook his 
head over it, and told us we “‘must 
get back to this tomorrow rather 
40 livelier.” Then, when we had eaten 
our pork, and each had a stiff glass 
of brandy grog, the three chiefs got 
together in a corner to discuss our 
prospects. 
It appears they were at their wits’ 
end what to do, the stores being so 
low that -we must have been starved 
into surrender long before help came. 
But our best hope, it was decided, 145 
was to kill off the buccaneers until they 
hauled down their flag or ran away 
with the Hispaniola, From nineteen 
they were already reduced to fifteen, 
two others were wounded, and one, at 
least—the man shot beside the gun— 
severely wounded, if he were not dead. 
Every time we had a crack at them, 
we were to take it, saving our own 
lives, with the extremest care. And, 
besides that, we had two able allies— 
rum and the climate. 
As for the first, though we were 
about half a mile away, we could hear 
them roaring and singing late into the 
night; and as for the second, the 
doctor staked his wig that, camped 
where they were in the marsh, and 
unprovided with remedies, the half of 
them would be on their backs before a 
week. 
“So,” he added, “if we are not all 
shot down first, they'll be glad to be 
packing in the schooner. It’s always 
a ship, and they can get to buccaneer- 
ing again, I suppose.” 
“First ship that ever I lost,” said 
Captain Smollett. 
I was dead tired, as you may fancy, 
and when I got to sleep, which was 
not till after a great deal of tossing, 
I slept like a log of wood. 
The rest had long been up, and had 
already breakfasted and increased the 
pile of firewood by about half as much 
again, when I was awakened by a 
bustle and the sound of voices. 
“Flag of truce!’ I heard someone 
say; and then, immediately after, witha 
ery of surprise, “Silver himself!’ And, 
at that, up L jumped, and, rubbing my 
eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall. 
CHAPTER XX 
Sttver’s Emsassy 
Sure enough, there were two men 
just outside the stockade, one of them 
waving a white cloth; the other, no 50 
60 
70
-P-A-G-E-155
40 146 
less a person than Silver himself, stand- 
ing placidly by. 
It was still quite early, and the cold- 
est. morning that I think I ever was 
abroad in; a chill that pierced into 
the marrow. The sky was bright and 
cloudless overhead, and the tops of 
the trees shone rosily in the sun. 
But where Silver stood with his lieu- 
tenant all was still in shadow, and 
they waded knee deep in a low, white 
vapor, that had crawled during the 
night out of the morass... The chill 
and the vapor taken together told a 
poor tale of theisland. It was plain- 
ly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot. 
“Keep indoors, men,” said the cap- 
tain. “Ten to one this is a trick.” 
‘Then he hailed the buccaneer. 
“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.” 
“Flag of truce,” cried Silver. 
The captain was in the porch, keep- 
ing himself carefully out of the way 
of a treacherous shot should any be 
intended. He turned and spoke to 
us: . 
“Doctor’s watch on the lookout. 
Dr. Livesey, take the north side, if 
you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. 
The watch below, all hands to load 
muskets. Lively, men, and careful.” 
And then he turned again to the 
mutineers, 
“And what do you want with your 
flag of truce?” he cried. 
This time it was the other man 
who replied. 
“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come on 
board and make terms,” he shouted. 
“Cap’n Silver! Don’t know him. 
Who’s he?” cried the captain. And 
we could hear him adding to himself: 
“Cap’n, is it? My heart, and here’s 
promotion!” 
Long John answered for himself. 
“Me, sir. These poor lads have 
chosen me cap’n, after your desertion, 
sir’—laying a particular emphasis 
upon the word “desertion.” “We're THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
willing to submit, if we can come | 
terms, and no bones about it. All 
ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, | 
let me safe and sound out of ,this hei 
stockade, and one minute to get o 
o” shot before a gun is fired.” 
“My man,” said Captain Smollet 
“T have not the slightest desire to tal 
to you. If you wish to talk to m 
you can come, that’s all. If there 
any treachery, it'll be on your sid. 
and the Lord help you.” 
“That’s enough, cap’n,” shouted 
Long John, cheerily. “A word from 
you’s enough. I know a gentleman, 
and you may lay to that.” 
We could see the man who carrie 
the flag of truce attempting to hol 
Silver back. Nor was that wonderfu 
seeing how cavalier had been th 
captain’s answer. But Silver laughe 
at him aloud, and slapped him on the 
back, as if the idea of alarm had been 
absurd. Then he advanced to the 
stockade, threw over his crutch,’ got 
a leg up, and with great vigor and 
skill succeeded in surmounting the 
fence and dropping safely to the other 
side. 
I will confess that I was far too 
much taken up with what was going 
on to be of the slightest use as sentry; 
indeed, I had already deserted my 
eastern loophole, and crept up behind 
the captain, who had now seated him- 
self on the threstiold, with his elbows 
on. his knees, his head. in his hands, 
and his eyes fixed on the water, as it 
bubbled out of the old iron kettle in 
the sand. He was whistling to him- 
self, “Come, Lasses and Lads.” 
Silver had terrible hard work get- 
ting up the knoll. What with the 
steepness of the incline, the thick tree 
stumps, and the soft sand, he and his 
crutch were as helpless as a ship in 
stays. But he stuck to it like a man 
in silence, and at last arrived before 
the captain, whom he saluted in the 80
-P-A-G-E-156
TREASURE. ISLAND 
handsomest style. He was tricked out 
in his best; an immense blue coat, 
thick with brass buttons, hung as low 
as to his knees, and a fine laced hat 
was set on the back of his head. 
“Here you are, my man,” said the 
captain, raising his head. “You had 
better sit down.” 
“You ain’t a-going to let me inside, 
io cap’n?” complained Long John. “It’s 
a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, 
to sit outside upon the sand.” 
“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if 
you had pleased to be an honest man, 
you might have been sitting in your 
galley. It’s your own doing. You're 
either my ship’s cook—and then you 
were treated handsome—or Cap’n 
Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, 
20 and then you can go hang!” 
“Well, well, cap’n,” returned the 
sea cook, sitting down as he was bidden 
on the sand, “you'll have to give me 
a hand up again, that’s all. A sweet 
pretty place you have of it here. Ah, 
there’s Jim! The top of the morning 
to you, Jim—Doctor, here’s my serv- 
ice. Why, there you all are together 
like a happy family, in a manner of 
30 speaking.” 
“Tf you have anything to say, my 
man, better say it,” said the captain. 
“Right you were, Cap’n Smollett,” 
replied Silver. “Dooty is dooty, to be 
sure. Well, now, you look here, that 
was a good lay of yours last night. I 
don’t deny it was’a good lay. Some 
of you pretty handy with a hand- 
spike-end. And I'll not deny neither 
40 but what some of my people was 
shook—maybe all was shook; maybe 
I was shook myself; maybe that’s 
why I’m here for terms. But you 
\ mark me, cap’n, it won’t do twice, by 
; thunder! We'll have to do sentry-go, 
| and ease off a point or so on the rum. 
Maybe you think we were all a sheet 
in the wind’s eye. But Ill tell you I 
| was sober; I was on’y dog tired; and 147 
if I’d awoke a second sooner I'd a 
caught you at the act, I would. He 
wasn’t dead when I gét round to him, 
not he.” ot 
“Well?” says Captain Smollett, as 
cool as can be. 
All that Silver said was a riddle to 
him, but you would never have 
guessed it from his tone. As for me, 
I began to have an inkling. Ben 
Gunn’s last words came back to my 
mind. I began to suppose that he 
had paid the buccaneers a visit while 
they all lay drunk together round their 
fire, and I reckoned up with glee that 
we had‘only fourteen enemies to deal 
with. 
“Well, here it is,” said Silver. “We 
want that treasure, and we'll have it 
—that’s our point! You would just 
as soon save your lives, I reckon; and 
that’s yours. You have a chart, 
haven’t you?” / 
“That’s as may be,” replied the 
captain. 
“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” 
returned Long John. “‘You needn’t 70 
be so husky with a man; there ain’t a - 
particle of service in that, and you 
may lay to it. What I mean is, we 
want your chart. Now, I never meant 
you no harm, myself.” 
“That won’t do with me, my man,” 
interrupted the captain. ‘We know 
exactly what you meant to do, and 
we don’t care; for now, you. see, you 
can’t do it.” 
And the captain looked at him 
calmly, and proceeded to fill a pipe. 
“Tf Abe Gray—” Silver broke out. 
“Avast there!’ cried Mr. Smollett. 
“Gray told me nothing, and I asked 
him nothing; and what’s more I would 
see you and him and this whole island 
blown clean out of the water into 
blazes first. So there’s my mind for 
you, my man, on that.” 
This little whiff of temper seemed 
to cool Silver down. He had been
-P-A-G-E-157
10 148 
growing nettled before, but now he 
pulled himself together. 
“Like enough,” said he. “I would 
set no limits to what gentlemen might ' 
consider shipshape, or might not, as 
the case were. And, seein’ as how 
you are about to take a pipe, Cap’n, 
T’ll make so free as to do likewise.” 
And he filled a pipe and lighted it; 
and the two men sat silently smoking 
for quite a while, now looking each 
other in the face, now stopping their 
tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. 
It was as good as the play to see them. 
“Now,” resumed Silver, “‘here it is. 
You give us the chart to get the 
treasure by, and drop shooting poor 
seamen, and stoving of their heads in 
_ while asleep. You do that, and we'll 
30 
40 offer you a choice. Either you come 
aboard along of us, once the treasure’s 
shipped, and then I'll give you my 
affy-davy, upon my word of honor, to 
clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or, 
if that ain’t to your fancy, some of 
my hands being rough, and having 
old scores, on account of hazing, then 
you can stay here, you can. We'll 
divide stores with you, man for man; 
and I'll give my affy-davy, as before, 
to speak the first ship I sight, and 
send ’em here to pick you up. Now 
you'll own that’s talking. Handsomer 
you couldn’t look to get, not you. 
And I hope”—raising his voice—“that 
all hands in this here block-house will 
overhaul my words, for what is spoke 
to one is spoke to all.” 
Captain Smollett rose from his seat, 
and knocked out the ashes of his pipe 
in the palm of his left hand. 
“Ts that all?” he asked. 
“Every last word, by thunder!” 
answered John. “Refuse that, and 
you’ve seen the last of me but musket- 
balls.” . 
“Very good,” said the captain. 
“Now you'll hear me. If you'll come THE WORLD. OF ADVENTURE 
up one by one, unarmed, I’ll engage 
to clap you all in irons and take you « 
home to a fair trial in England. If 
you won’t, my name is Alexander 
Smollett, I’ve flown my sovereign’s 
colors, and I'll see you all to Davy 
Jones. You can’t find the treasure. 
You can’t sail the ship—there’s not a 
man among you fit to sail the ship. 
You can’t fight us—Gray, there, got 
away from five of you. Your ship’s 
in irons, Master Silver; you’re on a « 
lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand 
here and tell you so; and they’re the 
last good words you'll get from me; 
for, in the name of heaven, I'll put 
a bullet in your back when next I 
meet you. Tramp, my lad. Bundle 
out of this, please, hand over hand, 
and double quick.” 
Silver’s face was a picture; his eyes 
started in his head with wrath. He 1 
shook the fire out of his pipe. 
“Give me a hand up!” he cried. 
“Not I,” returned the captain. 
“Who'll give me a hand up?” he 
roared. 
Not a man among us moved. 
Growling the foulest imprecations, he 
crawled along the sand till he got 
hold of the porch and could hoist him- 
self again upon his crutch. Then he § 
spat into the spring. 
“There!” he cried, “that’s what I 
think of ye. Before an hour’s out, 
T'll stove in your old block-house like 
arum puncheon. -Laugh, by thunder, 
laugh! Before an hour’s out, ye’ll 
laugh upon the other side. Them 
that die’ll be the lucky ones.” 
And with a dreadful oath he stum- 
bled off, plowed down the sand, was : 
helped across the stockade, after four 
or five failures, by the man with the 
flag of truce, and disappeared in an 
instant afterwards among the trees.

_ CHAPTER XXI 
Tue Arrack 
As soon as Silver disappeared, the 
captain, who had been closely watch- 
ing him, turned toward the interior 
cf the house, and found not a man of 
us at his post but Gray. It was the 
first time we had ever scen him angry. 
“Quarters!” he roared. And then, 
as we all slunk ‘back to our places, 
“Gray,” he said, “Dll put your name 
in the log; you’ve stood by your duty 
like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, Pm 
surprised at you, sir. Doctor, I 
thought you had worn the king’s éoat! 
If that was how you served at Fonte- 
noy, sir, you’d have been better in 
your berth.” 
The doctor’s watch were all back at 
their loopholes, the rest were busy 
loading the spare muskets, and every 
one with a red face, you may be cer- 
tain, and a flea in his ear, as the say- 
ing is. 
The captain looked on for a while 
in silence. Then he spoke. 
“My lads,” said he, “I’ve given 
Silver a broadside. I pitched it in 
red-hot’ on purpose; and before the 
hour’s out, as he said, we shall be 
boarded. We’re outnumbered, I 
needn’t tell you that, but we fight in 
shelter; and, a minute ago, I should 
have said we fought with discipline. 
I’ve no manner of doubt that we can 
drub them, if you choose.” 
Then he went the rounds, and saw, 
as he said, that all was clear. 
On the two short sides of the house, 
east and west, there were only two. 
loopholes; on the south side where the 
porch was, two again; and on the 
north side, five. There was a round 
score of muskets for the seven of us; 
the firewood had been built into four 
piles—tables, you might say—one 
about the middle of each side, and on 
each of these tables some ammunition’ . 
  149 
and four loaded muskets were laid 
ready to the hand of the defenders. 
In the middle, the cutlasses lay 
ranged, . 
“Toss out: the fire,” said the cap- 
tain; “the chill is past, and we mustn’t 
have smoke in our eyes.” 
The iron fire basket was carried 
bodily out by Mr, Trelawney, and the 
embers smothered among the sand. 
“Hawkins hasn’t had his breakfast. 
Hawkins, help yourself, and back to 
your post to eat it,” continued Cap- 
tain Smollett. “Lively, now, my lad, 
you'll want it before you've done. 
Hunter, serve out a round of brandy 
to all] hands.” 
And while this was going on, the 
captain completed, in his own mind, 
the plan of the defense. 
“Doctor, you will take the door,” 
he resumed. “See, and don’t expose 
yourself; keep within, and fire through 
the porch. Hunter, take the east 
side, there. Joyce, you stand by the 
west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you 
are the best shot—you and Gray will 
take this long north side, with the 
five loopholes; it’s there the danger is. 
If they can get up to it, and fire in 
upon us through our own ports, 
things would begin to look dirty. 
Hawkins, neither you nor I are much 
account at the shooting; we'll stand 
by to load and bear a hand.” - 
As the captain had said, the chill 
was past. As soon as the sun had 
climbed above our girdle of trees, it 
fell with all its force upon the clear- 
ing, and drank up the vapors at a 
draught. Soon the sand was baking, 
and the resin melting in the logs of 
the block-house. Jackets and coats 
were flung aside; shirts thrown open 
at the neck, and rolled up to the 
shoulders; and we stood there, each 
at his post. in a fever of heat and 
anxiety. 
An hour passed away. 50
-P-A-G-E-159
    lo 
30 150 
“Hang them!’ said the captain. 
“This is as dull as the doldrums. 
Gray, whistle for a wind.” 
And just at that moment came the 
first news of the attack. 
“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if 
I see anyone am I to fire?” 
“T told you so!” cried the captain. 
“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce, 
with the same quiet civility. 
Nothing followed for a time; but 
the remark had set us all on the alert, 
straining ears and eyes, the musketeers 
with their pieces balanced in their 
hands, the captain out in the middle 
of the block-house, with his mouth 
very tight and a frown on his face. 
So some seconds passed, till sud- 
denly Joyce whipped up his musket 
and fired. The report had scarcely 
died away ere it was repeated and re- 
peated from without in a scattering 
volley, shot behind shot, like a string 
of geese, from every side of the en- 
closure. Several bullets struck the 
log-house, but not one entered; and, 
as the smoke cleared away and van- 
ished, the stockade and the woods 
around it looked as quiet and empty 
as before. Not a bough waved, not 
the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed 
the presence of our foes. 
“Did you hit your man?” asked 
the captain. 
“No, sir,” replied Joyce. 
not, sir.” 
“Next best thing to tell the truth,” 
muttered Captain Smollett. “Load 
his gun, Hawkins. How many should 
you say there were on your side, 
doctor?” 
“T know precisely,” said Dr. Live- 
sey. “Three shots were fired on this 
side. I saw the three flashes—two “T believe 
close together—one farther to the - 
west.” 
“Three!” repeated the captain. 
“And how many on yours, Mr. Tre- 
lawney?” THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
But this was not so easily answered.” 50 
There had come many from the north 
—seven, by the squire’s computation; 
eight or nine, according to Gray. 
From the east and west only a single 
shot had been fired. It was plain, 
therefore, that the attack would be 
developed from the north, and that 
on the other three sides we were only 
to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. 
But Captain Smollett made no change 60 
in his arrangements. If the mutineers 
succeeded in crossing the stockade, he 
argued, they would take possession of 
any unprotected loophole, and shoot 
us ‘down like rats in our own strong- 
hold. 
Nor had we much time left to us 
for thought. Suddenly, with a loud 
huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped 
from the woods on the north side, and 70 
ran straight on the stockade. At the . 
same moment, the fire was once more 
opened from the woods, and a rifle 
ball sang through the doorway, and 
knocked the doctor’s musket into bits. 
The boarders swarmed over the 
fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray 
fired again and yet again; three men 
fell, one forwards, into the enclosure, 
two back on the outside. But of so 
these, one was evidently more fright- 
ened than hurt, for he was on his feet 
_again in a crack, and instantly dis- 
appeared among the trees. 
Two had bit the dust, one had fled, 
four had made good their footing in- 
side our defenses; while from the 
shelter of the woods seven or eight 
men, each evidently supplied with 
several muskets, kept up a hot though 90 
useless fire on the log-house. 
The four who had boarded made 
straight before them for the building, 
shouting as they ran, and the men 
among the trees shouted back to en- 
courage them. Several shots were 
fired; but such was the hurry of the 
marksmen, that not one appears to
-P-A-G-E-160
TREASURE ISLAND 
have taken effect. In a moment, the 
four pirates had swarmed up the 
mound and were upon us. 
The head of Job Anderson, the 
boatswain, appeared at the middle 
loophole. 
“At ’em, all hands—all hands!’ he 
roared, in a voice of thunder. 
At the same moment, another pirate 
10 grasped Hunter’s musket by the 
muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, 
plucked it through the loophole, and, 
with one stunning blow, laid the poor 
fellow senseless on the floor. Mean- 
while a third, running unharmed all 
round the house, appeared suddenly 
in the doorway, and fell with his 
cutlass on the doctor. 
Our position was utterly reversed. 
20 A moment since we were firing, under 
cover, at an exposed enemy; now it 
was we who lay uncovered, and could 
not return a blow. 
The log-house was full of smoke, 
to which we owed our comparative 
safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes 
and reports of pistol shots, and one | 
loud groan rang in my ears. 
“Out, lads, out, and fight ’em in 
30 the open! Cutlasses!’’ cried the cap- 
tain. 
I snatched a cutlass from the pile, 
and someone, at the same time snatch- 
ing another, gave me a cut across the 
knuckles which I hardly felt. I 
dashed out of the door into the clear 
sunlight. Someone was close behind, 
I knew not whom. Right in front, 
the doctor was pursuing his assailant 
40 down the hill, and, just as my eyes fell 
upon him, beat down his guard, and 
sent him sprawling on his back, with 
a great slash across the face. 
“Round the house, lads! round the 
house!” cried the captain; and even 
in the hurly-burly I perceived a change 
in his voice. 
Mechanically I obeyed, turned east- 
wards, and with my cutlass raised, 11 
yan round the corner of the house. 
Next moment I was face to face with 
Anderson. He roared aloud, and his 
hanger went up above his head, flash- 
ing in the sunlight. I had not time to 
be afraid, but, as the blow still hung 
impending, leaped in a trice upon one 
side, and missing my foot in the soft 
sand, rolled headlong down the slope. 
When I had first sallied from the 
door, the other mutineers. had been 
already swarming up the palisade to 
make an end of us. One man in @ 
red nightcap, with his cutlass in his 
mouth, had even got upon the top, 
and thrown a leg across. Well, so 
short had been the interval that 
when I found my feet again all was 
in the same posture, the fellow with 
the red nightcap still halfway over, 
another still just showing his head 
above the top of the stockade. And 
yet, in this breath of time, the fight 
was over, and the victory was ours. 
Gray, following close behind me, 
had cut down the big boatswain ere 
he had time to recover from his last 
blow. Another had been shot at a 
loophole in the very act of firing into 
the house, and now lay in agony, the 
pistol still smoking in his hand. A 
third, as I had seen, the doctor had 
disposed of at a blow. Of the four 
who had scaled the palisade, one only 
remained unaccounted for, and he, 
having left his cutlass on the field, was 
now clambering out again with the 
fear of death upon him. 
‘‘Fire—fire from the house!”’ cried 
the doctor. : 
“And you, lads, back into cover.” 
But his words were unheeded, no 
shot was fired, and the last boarder 
made good his escape, and disap- 
peared with the rest into the wood. 
In three seconds nothing remained of 
the attacking party but the five who 
had fallen, four on the inside, and one 
on the outside, of the palisade. 50

30 152 
The doctor and Gray and I ran full 
speed for shelter. The survivors 
would soon be back where they had 
left their muskets, and at any moment 
the fire might recommence. 
The house was by this time some- 
what cleared of smoke, and we saw 
at a glance the price we had paid for 
victory. Hunter lay beside his loop- 
hole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot 
through the head, never to move 
again; while right in the center, the 
‘squire was supporting the captain, one 
as pale as the other. 
“The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. 
Trelawney. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“Have they run?” asked Mr. Smol- 
lett. 
“All that could, you may be bound,” 
returned the doctor; “but there’s five 
of them will never run again.” 
: “Five!” cried the captain. “Come, 
that’s better. Five against three leaves 
us four to nine. That’s better odds 
than we had at starting. We were 
seven to nineteen then, or thought we 
were, and that’s as bad to bear.”* 
*The mutineers were soon only eight in num- 
ber, for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on 
board the schooner died the same evening of 
his wound, but this was, of course, not_ known 
till after by the faithful party. (Note by

PART V 
MY SEA ADVENTURE 
CHAPTER XXII 
How My Sra Aventure Bran 
There was nd return of the mu- 
tineers—not so much as another shot 
out of the woods. They had “got 
their rations for that day,” as the 
captain put it, and we had the place 
to ourselves and a quiet time to over- 
haul the wounded and get dinner. 
Squire and I cooked outside in spite 
of the danger, and even outside we 
could hardly tell what we were at, 
for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor’s patients. 
Out of the eight men who had fallen 
in action, only three still breathed— 
that one of the pirates who had been 
shot at the loophole, Hunter, and 
Captain Smollett; and of these the 
first two were as good as dead; the 
mutineer, indeed, died under the 
doctor’s knife, and Hunter, do what 
we could, never recovered conscious- 
ness in this world. He lingered all 
day, breathing loudly like the old 5 
buccaneer at home in his apoplectic 
fit; but the bones of his chest had 
been crushed by the blow and his
-P-A-G-E-162
TREASURE ISLAND 
skull fractured in falling, and some 
time in the following night, without 
sign or sound, he went to his Maker. 
As for the captain, his wounds were 
grievous indeed, but not dangerous. 
No organ was fatally injured. An- 
derson’s ball—for it was Job that 
shot him first—had broken his shoul- 
der blade and touched the lung, not 
badly; the second had only torn and 
displaced some muscles in the calf. 
He was sure to recover, the doctor 
said, but, in the meantime and for 
weeks to come, he must not walk nor 
move his arm, nor so much as speak 
when he could help it. 
My own accidental cut across the 
knuckles was a flea bite. Dr. Livesey 
patched it up with plaster, and pulled 
to my ears for me into the bargain. 
After dinner the squire and the 
doctor sat by the captain’s side a 
while in consultation; and when they 
had talked to their hearts’ content, it 
being then a little past noon, the 
doctor took up his hat and pistols, 
girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his 
pocket, and with a musket over his 
shoulder, crossed the palisade on the 
30 north side, and set off briskly through 
the trees. 
Gray and I were sitting together at 
the far end of the block-house, to be 
out of earshot of our officers consult- 
ing; and Gray took his pipe out of 
his mouth and fairly forgot to put it 
back again, so thunderstruck he was 
at this occurrence. 
“Why, in the name of Davy Jones,” 
40 said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?” 
“Why, no,” says I. “He’s about 
the last of this crew for that, I take it.” 
“Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad 
he may not be; but if he’s not, you 
mark my words, I am.” 
“T take it,” replied I, “the doctor 
has his idea; and if I am right, he’s 
going now to see Ben Gunn.” 
I was right, as appeared later; but, 153 
in the meantime, the house being 
stifling hot, and the little patch of 
sand inside the palisade ablaze with 
midday sun, I began to get another 
thought into my head, which was not 
by any means so right. What I began 
to do was to envy the doctor, walking 
in the cool shadow of the woods, with 
the birds about him, and the pleasant 
smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, 
with my clothes stuck to the hot 
resin, and so much blood about me,- 
and so many poor dead bodies lying 
all around, that I took a disgust of the 
place that was almost as strong as fear. - 
All the time I was washing out the 
block-house, and then washing up 
the things from dinner, this disgust 
and envy kept growing stronger and 
stronger, till at last, being near a 
bread-bag, and no one then observing 
me, I took the first step toward my 
escape, and filled both pockets of my 
coat with biscuit. ; . 
I was a fool, if you like, and cer- 
tainly I was going to do a foolish, 
overbold act; but I was determined to 
do it with all the precautions in my 
power. These biscuits, should any- 
thing befall me, would keep me, at 
least from starving till far on in the 
next day. 
The next thing J laid hold of was.a 
brace of pistols, and as I already had a 
powderhorn and bullets, I felt myself 
well supplied with arms. 
As for the scheme I had in my head, 
it was not a bad one in itself. I was 
to go down the sandy spit that divides 
the anchorage on the east from the 
open sea, find the white rock I had 
observed last evening, and ascertain 
whether it was there or not that Ben 
Gunn had hidden his boat; a thing 
quite worth doing, as I still believe. 
But as I was certain I should not be 
allowed to leave the inclosure, my 
only plan was to take French leave,

ing; and that was so bad a way of 
doing it as made the thing itself 
wrong. But I was only a boy, and I 
had made my mind up. 
Well, as things at last fell out, I 
found an admirable opportunity. The 
squire and Gray were busy helping 
the captain with his bandages; the 
coast was clear; I made a bolt for it 
over ‘the stockade and into the thickest 
of the trees, and before my absence 
was observed I was out of cry of my 
companions. 
This was my second folly, far worse 
_ than the first, as I left but two sound we 5 men to guard the house; but like the 
first, it was a help toward saving all 
of us. 
I took my way straight for the east 
coast of the island, for I was deter- 
mined to go down the sea side of the 
spit to avoid all chance of observation 
from the anchorage. It was already 
late in the afternoon, although still 
warm and sunny. As I continued to 
thread the tall woods, I could hear 
from far before me not only the con- 
tinuous thunder of the surf, but a 
certain tossing of foliage and grinding 
of boughs which showed me the sea 
breeze had set in higher than usual. 
Soon cool draughts of air began to 
reach me; and a few steps farther I 
came forth into the open borders of 
the grove, and saw the sea lying blue 
and sunny to the horizon, and the 
surf tumbling and tossing its foam 
along the beach. 
I have never seen the sea quiet 
round Treasure Island. The sun 
might blaze overhead, the air be 
without a breath, the surface smooth 
and blue, but still these great rollers 
would be running along all the ex- 
ternal coast, thundering and thunder- 
ing by day and night; and I scarce 
believe there is one spot in the island 
where a man would be out of earshot of 
their noise. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
I walked along beside the surf with 
great enjoyment, till, thinking I was 
now got far enough to the south, I took 
the cover of some thick bushes, and 
crept warily up to the ridge of the spit. 
Behind me was the sea, in front the 
anchorage. ‘The sea breeze, as though 
it had the sooner blown itself out by 
its unusual violence, was already at an 
end; it had been succeeded by light, 
variable airs from the south and south- 
east, carrying great banks of fog; and 
the anchorage, under lee of Skeleton 
Island, lay still and leaden as when 
first we entered it. The Hispaniola, 
in that unbroken mirror, was exactly 
portrayed from the truck to the water- 
line, the Jolly Roger hanging from her 
peak. 
Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver 
in the stern-sheets—him I could al- : 
ways recognize—while a couple of 
men were leaning over the stern bul- 
warks, one of them with a red cap— 
the very rogue that I had seen some 
hours before stride-legs upon the 
palisade. Apparently they were talk- 
ing and laughing, though at that dis- 
tance—upwards of a mile—I could, of 
course, hear no word of what was said. 
All at once there began the most : 
horrid, unearthly screaming, which at 
first startled me badly, though I had 
soon remembered the voice of Captain 
Flint, and even thought I could make 
out the bird by her bright plumage as 
she sat perched upon her master’s 
wrist. 
Soon after the jolly-boat shoved 
off and pulled for shore, and the man 
with the red cap and his comrade went : 
below by the cabin companion. 
Just about the same time the sun 
had gone down behind the Spyglass, 
and as the fog was collecting rapidly, 
it began to grow dark in earnest. I 
saw I must lose no time if I were to 
find the boat that evening. 
The white rock, visible enough  
-P-A-G-E-164
TREASURE ISLAND 
above the brush, was still some eighth 
of a mile farther down the spit, and it 
took me a goodish while to get up with 
“t, crawling, often on all-fours, among 
be scrub. Night had almost come 
then I laid my hand on its rough sides. 
tight below it there was an exceed- 
agly small hollow of green turf, hid- 
en by banks and a thick underwood 
bout knee-deep, that grew there 
ery plentifully; and in the center of 
he dell, sure enough, a little tent of 
oatskins, like what the gypsies carry 
bout with them in England. 
I dropped into the hollow, lifted the 
ide of the tent, and there was Ben 
tunn’s boat—homemade if ever any- 
hing was homemade: a rude, lop- 
ided framework of tough wood, and 
tretched upon that a. covering of 
oatskin, with the hair inside. The 
hing -was extremely small, even for 
ae, and I could hardly imagine that 
t could have floated with a full- 
ized man. There was one thwart, 
et as low as possible, a kind of 
tretcher in the bows, and a double 
vaddle for propulsion. 
I had not then seen a coracle, such 
's the ancient Britons made, but I 
lave seen one since, and J can give 
rou no fairer idea of Ben Gunn’s boat 
han by saying it was like the first 
md the worst coracle ever made by 
nan. But the advantage of the 
oracle it certainly possessed, for it 
vas exceedingly light and portable. 
Well, now that I had found the 
soat, you would have thought I had 
1ad enough of truantry for once; but, 
a the meantime, I had taken another 
totion, and become so obstinately fond 
f it that I would have carried it out, 
believe, in the teeth of Captain 
smollett himself. This was to slip 
out under cover of the night, cut the 
Hispaniola adrift, and let her go 
ashore where she fancied. I had quite 
made up my mind that the mutineers, 155 
after their repulse of the morning, had 
nothing nearer their hearts than. to 
up anchor and away to sea; this, I 
thought, it would be a fine thing to 
prevent; and now that I had seen how 
they left their watchmen unprovided 
with a boat, I thought it might be 
done with little risk. 
Down I sat to wait for darkness, and 
made a hearty meal of biscuit. It 
was a night out of ten thousand for 
my purpose. The fog had now buried 
all heaven. As the last rays of day- 
light dwindled and disappeared, ab- 
solute blackness settled down on 
Treasure Island. And when, at last, 
I shouldered the coracle, and groped 
my way stumblingly out of the hollow 
where I had supped, there were but 
two points visible on the whole 
anchorage. 
One was the great fire on shore, by 
which the defeated pirates lay carous- 
ing in the swamp. The other, a mere 
blur of light upon the darkness, indi- 
cated the position of the anchored 
ship. She had swung round to the 
ebb—her bow was now toward me— 
the only lights on board were in the 
cabin; and what I saw was merely a 
reflection on the fog of the strong 
rays that flowed from the stern win- 
dow. 
The ebb had already run some time, 
and I had to wade through a long belt 
of swampy sand, where I sank several 
times above the ankle, before I came 
to the edge of the retreating water, 
and wading a little way in, with some 
strength and dexterity, set my 
coracle, keel downward, on the sur- 
face.

my height and weight, both buoyant 
and clever in a seaway; but she was 
the most cross-grained, lopsided craft 
to manage. Do as you pleased, she 
always made more leeway than any- 
thing else, and turning round and 
round was the maneuver she was best 
at. Even Ben Gunn himself has 
admitted that she was “queer to 
handle till you knew her way.” 
Certainly I did not know her way. 
She turned in every direction but the 
one I was bound to go; the most part 
of the time we were broadside on, and 
I am very sure I never should have 
made the ship at all but for the tide. 
By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, 
the tide was still sweeping me down; 
and there lay the Hispaniola right 
in the fairway, hardly to be missed. 
First she loomed before me like a 
blot of something yet blacker than 
darkness, then her spars and hull 
began to take shape, and the next 
moment, as it seemed (for, the farther 
I went, the brisker grew the current 
of the ebb), I was alongside of her 
hawser, and had laid hold. 
The hawser was as taut as a bow- 
string, and the current so strong she 
pulled upon her anchor. All round 
the hull, in the blackness, the rippling 
current bubbled and chattered like a 
little mountain stream. One cut with 
my sea-gully, and the Hispaniola 
would go humming down the tide. 
So far so good; but it next occurred 
to my recollection that a taut hawser, 
suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous 
as a kicking horse. Ten to one, if I 
were so foolhardy as to cut the His- 
paniola from her anchor, I and the 
eoracle would be knocked clean: out 
of the water. 
This brought me to a full stop, and 
if fortune had not again particularly 
favored me, I should have had to 
abandon my design. But the light

quaver at the end of every verse, and 
seemingly no end to it at all but the 
patience of the singer. - I had heard it 
on the voyage more than once, and 
remembered these words: 
But one man of her crew alive, 
What put to sea with seventy-five. 
And I thought it was a ditty rather 
too dolefully appropriate for a com- 
pany that had met such cruel losses 
in the morning. But, indeed, from 
what I saw, all these buccaneers were 
as callous as the sea they sailed on. 
At last the breeze came; the 
schooner sidled and drew nearer in 
the dark; I felt the hawser slacken 
once more, and with a good, tough 
effort, cut the last fibers through. 
The breeze had but little action on 
the coracle, and I was almost in- 
stantly swept against the bows of 
the Hispaniola. At the same time 
the’ schooner. began to turn upon her 
heel, spinning slowly, end for end, 
across the current. 
I wrought like a fiend, for I expected 
every moment to be swamped; and 
since I found I could not push the 
eoracle directly off, I now shoved 
straight astern. At length I was 
clear of my dangerous neighbor; and 
just as I gave the last impulsion, my 
hands came across a light cord that 
was trailing overboard across the stern 
bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it. 
Why I should have done so I can 
hardly say. It was at first mere 
instinct; but once I had it in my 
hands and found it fast, curiosity 
began to get the upper hand, and I 
determined I should have one look 
through the cabin window. I pulled 
in hand over hand on the cord, and, 
when I judged myself near enough, 
rose at infinite risk to about half my 
height, and thus commanded the roof 
and a slice of the interior of the cabin. 157 
By this time the schooner and her 
little consort were gliding pretty 
swiftly through the water; indeed, 
we had already fetched up level with 
the camp fire. The ship was talking, 
as sailors say, loudly, treading the 
innumerable ripples with an incessant 
weltering splash; and until I got my 
eye above the window-sill I could not 
comprehend why the watchmen had 
taken no alarm. One glance, how- 
ever, was sufficient; and it was only 
one glance that I durst take from that 
unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands 
and his companion locked together in 
deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon 
the other’s throat. . 
I dropped upon the thwart again, 
none too soon, for I was near over- 
board. I could see nothing for the 
moment but these two furious, en- 
crimsoned faces, swaying together un- 
der the smoky lamp; and I shut my 
eyes to let them grow once more 
familiar with the darkness. 
The endless ballad had come to an 
end at last, and the whole diminished 
company about the camp fire had 
broken into the chorus I had heard 
so often: 
Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest— 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
Drink and the devil had done for the rest— 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
I was just thinking how busy 
drink and the devil were at that very 70 
moment in the cabin of the Hispaniola, _ 
when I was surprised by a sudden 
lurch of the coracle. At the same 
moment she yawed sharply and seemed 
to change her course. The speed in 
the meantime had strangely increased. 
I opened my eyes at once. All 
round me were little ripples, combing 
over with a sharp, bristling sound and 
slightly phosphorescent., The. His- 90 
 
-P-A-G-E-167

40 paniola herself, a few yards in whose 
wake I was still being whirled along, 
seemed to stagger in her course, and 
I saw her spars toss a little against 
the blackness of the night; nay, as 
T looked longer, I made sure she also 
was wheeling to the southward. 
I glanced over my shoulder, and 
my heart jumped against my ribs. 
There, right behind me, was the glow 
of the camp fire. The current had 
turned at right angles, sweeping round * 
along with it the tall schooner and 
the little dancing coracle; ever quick- 
ening, ever bubbling higher, ever 
muttering louder, it went spinning 
through the narrows for the open sea. 
Suddenly the schooner in front of 
me gave a violent yaw, turning, per- 
haps, through twenty degrees; and 
almost at the same moment one shout 
followed another from on board; I 
could hear feet pounding on the com- 
panion ladder; and I knew that the 
two drunkards had at last been in- 
terrupted in their quarrel and awak- 
ened to a sense of their disaster. 
I lay down flat in the bottom of 
that wretched skiff, and devoutly 
recommended my spirit to its Maker. 
At the end of the straits, I made sure 
we must fall into some bar of raging 
breakers, where all my troubles would 
be ended speedily; and though I 
could, perhaps, bear to die, I could not 
bear to look upon my. fate as it 
approached, 
So I must have lain for hours, con- 
tinually beaten to and fro upon the 
billows, now and again wetted with 
flying sprays, and never ceasing to 
expect death at the next plunge. 
Gradually weariness grew upon me; 
a numbness, an occasional stupor, 
fell upon my mind even in the midst ~ 
of my terrors; until sleep at last 
supervened, and in my _sea-tossed 
coracle I lay and dreamed of home 
and the old “Admiral Benbow.” THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
CHAPTER XXIV 
Tur CRUISE OF THE CoRACLE 
It was broad day when I awoke, and 
found myself tossing. at the southwest 
end of Treasure Island. The sun 
was up, but was still hid from me 
bebind the great bulk of the Spyglass, 
which on this side descended almost 
to the sea in formidable cliffs. 
Haulbowline Head and Mizzenmast 
Hill were at my elbow; the hill bare 
and dark, the head bound with cliffs 
forty or fifty feet high, and fringed 
with great masses of fallen rock. I 
was scarce a quarter of a mile to sea- 
ward, and it was my first thought to 
paddle in and Jand. 
That notion was soon given over. 
Among the fallen rocks the breakers 
spouted and bellowed; loud reverbera- 
tions, heavy sprays flying and falling, 
succeeded one another from second to 
second; and I saw myself, if I ven- 
tured nearer, dashed to death upon 
the rough shore, or spending my 
strength in vain to scale the beetling 
crags. 
Nor was that all; for crawling to- 
gether on flat tables of rock, or letting 
themselves drop into the sea with loud 
reports, I beheld huge, slimy mon- 
sters—soft snails, as it were, of in- 
credible bigness—two or three score 
of them together, making the rocks 
to echo with their barkings. 
I have understood since that they 
were sea lions, and entirely harmless. 
But the look of them, added to the 
difficulty of the shore and the high 
running of the surf, was more than 
enough to disgust me of that landing- 
place. I felt willing rather to starve 
at sea than to confront such perils. 
In the meantime I had a better 
chance, as I. supposed, before me. 
North of Haulbowline Head, the land 
runs in a long way, leaving, at low 
tide, a long. stretch of yellow sand. 70

-P-A-G-E-168
é 8 & TREASURE ISLAND 
To the north of that, again, there 
comes another cape-—-Cape of the 
Woods, as it was marked upon the 
chart—buried in tall, green pines, 
which descended to the margin of the 
sea. 
I remembered what Silver had said 
about the current that sets northward 
along the whole west coast of Treasure 
Island; and seeing from. my position 
that I was already under its influence, 
I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head 
behind me, and reserve my strength 
for an attempt to land upon the 
kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods. 
There was a great, smooth swell 
upon the sea. The wind blowing 
steady and gentle from the south, 
there was no contrariety between that 
and the current, and the billows rose 
and fell unbroken. . 
Had it been otherwise, I must long 
ago have perished; but as it was, it is 
surprising how easily and securely 
my little and light boat could ride. 
Often, as I still lay at the bottom, and 
kept no more than an eye above the 
gunwale, I would see a big blue sum- 
mit heaving close above me; yet the 
coracle would but. bounce a little, 
dance as if on springs, and subside on 
the other side into the trough as lightly 
as a bird. 
I began after a little to grow very 
bold, and sat up to try my skill at 
paddling. But even a small change 
in the disposition of the weight will 
produce violent changes in the be- 
havior of a coracle. And I had hardly 
moved before the boat, giving up at 
once her gentle, dancing movement, 
ran straight down a slope of water so 
steep that it made me giddy,. and 
struck her nose, with a spout of spray, 
deep into the side of the next wave. 
I was drenched and terrified, and 
fell instantly back into my old posi- 
tion, whereupon the coracle seemed 
to find her head again, and led me as 159 
softly as before among the billows. 
It was plain she was not to be inter- 
fered with, and at that rate, since I 50 
could in no way influence her course, ° 
what hope’ had I left of reaching land? 
I began to be horribly frightened, 
but I kept my head, for all that. 
First, moving with all care, I gradually 
baled out the coracle with my sea- 
cup; then getting my eye once more 
above the gunwale, I set myself to 
study how it was she managed to slip 
so quietly through the rollers. 
I found each wave, instead of the , 
big, smooth, glossy mountain it looks 
from shore, or from a vessel’s deck, 
was for all the world like any range of 
hills on the dry land, full of peaks 
and smooth places and valleys. The 
coracle, left to herself, turning from’ 
side to side, threaded, so to speak, 
her way through these lower parts, 
and avoided the steep slopes and 
higher, toppling summits of the wave. 
“Well, now,” thought I to myself, 
“ft is plain I must lie where I am, 
and not disturb the balance; but it is 
plain, also, that I can put the paddle 
over the side, and from time to time, 
in smooth places, give her a shove or 
two toward land.” No sooner thought 
upon than done. There I lay on my 
elbows, in the most trying attitude, 
and every now and again gave a weak 
stroke or two to turn her head to shore. 
It was very tiring, and slow work, 
yet I did visibly gain ground; and, 
as we drew near the Cape of the 
Woods, though I saw I must infallibly 
miss that point, I had still made some 
hundred yards of easting. I was, 
indeed, close in. 
green treée-tops swaying together in 
the breeze, and I felt sure I should 
make the next promontory without 
fail. ‘ 
It was high time, for I now began 
to be tortured with thirst. The glow 
of the sun from above, its thousand- I could see the cool, 90
-P-A-G-E-169
160 
~ fold reflection from the waves, the 
sea-water that fell and dried upon 
_me, caking my very lips with salt, 
combined“ to make my throat burn 
and my brain ache. The sight of 
the trees so near at hand had almost 
made me sick with longing; but the 
.current had soon carried me past the 
point; and, as the next reach of sea 
io opened out, I beheld a sight that 
changed the nature of my thoughts. 
Right in front of me, not half a 
mile away, I beheld the Hispaniola 
under sail. I made sure, of course, 
that I should be taken; but I was so 
distressed for want of water that I 
scarce knew whether to be glad or 
sorry at the thought;. and, long before 
I had come to a conclusion, surprise 
20 had taken entire possession of my 
mind, and I could do nothing but 
stare and wonder. 
The Hispaniola was under her main- 
sail and. two jibs, and the beautiful 
white canvas shone in the sun like 
snow or silver. When I first sighted 
her, all her sails were drawing; she 
was lying a course about northwest; 
and I presumed the men on board were 
30 going round the island on their way 
back to the anchorage. Presently 
she began to fetch more and more to 
the westward, so that I thought they 
had sighted me and were going about 
in chase. At last, however, she fell 
right into the wind’s eye, was taken 
dead aback, and stood there a while 
helpless, with her sails shivering. 
“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they 
49 must still be drunk as owls.” And 
I thought how Captain Smollett would 
have set them skipping. 
Meanwhile the schooner’ gradually 
fell off, and filled again upon another 
tack, sailed swiftly for a minute. or 
so, and brought up once more dead in 
the wind’s eye. Again and again was 
this repeated. To and fro, up and 
down, north, south, east, and west, THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
the Hispaniola sailed by swoops and| 
dashes, and at each repetition ended 
as she had begun, with idly-flapping 
canvas. It became plain to me that 
nobody was steering. And, if. so, 
where were the men? Either they 
were dead drunk, or had deserted her, 
I thought, and perhaps if I could get 
on board, I might return the vessel 
to her captain. 
The current was bearing coracle 
and schooner southward at an equal 
rate. As for the latter’s sailing, it 
was so wild and intermittent, and she 
hung each time so long in irons, that 
she certainly gained nothing, if she 
did not even lose. If only I dared to 
sit up and paddle, I made sure that 
I could overhaul her. The scheme 
had an air of adventure that inspired 
me, and the thought of the water- 
breaker beside the fore-companion 
doubled my growing courage. 
Up I got, was welcomed almost 
instantly by another cloud of spray, 
but this time stuck to my purpose; 
and set myself, with all my strength 
and caution, to paddle after the un- 
steered Hispaniola. Once I shipped 
a sea so heavy that I had to stop and 
bail, with my heart fluttering like a 
bird; but gradually I got into the way 
of the thing, and guided my coracle 
among the waves, with only now and 
then a blow upon her bows and a 
dash of foam in my face. : 
I was now gaining rapidly on the 
schooner; I could see the brass glisten 
on the tiller as it banged about; 
and still no soul appeared upon decks. 
I could not choose but suppose she 
was deserted. If not, the men were 
lying drunk below, where I might 
batten them down, perhaps, and do 
what I chose with the ship. 
For some time she had been doing 
the worst thing possible for me— 
71. fore-companion, the companion-way in the fore 
part of the ship.
-P-A-G-E-170
ai TREASURE ISLAND 
standing still. She headed nearly due 
south, yawing, of course, all the time. 
Each time she fell off, her sails partly 
filled, and these brought her, in a 
moment, right to the wind again. I 
have said this was the worst thing 
possible for me; for, helpless as she 
looked in this situation, with the 
canvas cracking like cannon, and the 
blocks trundling and banging on the 
deck, she still continued to run away 
from me, not only with the speed of 
the current, but by the whole amount 
of her leeway, which was naturally 
great. 
But now, at last, I had my chance. 
The breeze fel], for some seconds, very 
low, and the current gradually turning 
her, the Hispaniola revolved slowly 
round her center, and at last pre- 
sented me her stern, with the cabin 
window still gaping open,-and the lamp 
over the table still burning on into the 
day. The mainsail hung drooped like 
a banner. She was stock-still but for 
the current. 
For the last little while I had even 
lost; but now redoubling my efforts, 
I began once more to overhaul the 
) chase. 
I was not a hundred yards from her . 
when the wind came again in a clap; 
she filled on the port tack, and was off 
again, stooping and skimming like a 
swallow. 
My first impulse was one of despair, 
but my second was toward joy. 
Round she came, ‘till she was broad 
side on to me—round still till she 
o had covered a half, and then two- 
thirds, and then three-quarters of the 
distance that separated us. I could 
see the waves boiling white under her 
forefoot. Immensely tall she looked 
to me from my low station in the 
coracle, 
And then, of a sudden, I began to 
comprehend. I had scarce time to 
think—scarce time to act and save 161 
myself. I was on the summit of one 
swell when the schooner came stoop- 
ing over the next. The bowsprit was 
over my head. I sprang to my feet, 
and leaped, stamping the coracle 
under water. With one hand I caught 
the jib-boom, while my foot was 
lodged between the stay and the 
brace; and as I still clung there pant- 
ing, a dull blow told me that the 
schooner had charged down upon and 
struck the coracle, and that I was 
left without retreat on the Hispaniola. 
CHAPTER XXV 
I Sraixe tHe Joy Roger 
I had scarce gained a position on 
the bowsprit, when the flying jib 
flapped and filled upon the other tack, 
with a report like a gun. The schooner 
trembled to her keel under the reverse, 
but next moment, the other sails still 
drawing, the jib flapped back again, 
-and hung idle. 
This had nearly tossed me off into 
the sea; and now I lost no time, 
crawled back along. the bowsprit, and 
tumbled head foremost on the deck. 
I was on the lee side of the fore- 
castle, and the mainsail, which was 
still drawing, concealed from me a 
certain portion of the after-deck. 
Not a soul was to be seen. The 
planks, which had not been swabbed 
since the mutiny, bore the print of 
many feet; and an empty bottle, 
broken by the neck, tumbled to and 
fro like a live thing in the scuppers. 
Suddenly the Hispaniola came right 
into the wind. The jibs behind me 
cracked aloud; the rudder slammed 
to; the whole ship gave a sickening 
heave and shudder, and at the same 
moment the main-boom swung in- 
board, the sheet groaning in the 
blocks, and showed me the lee after- 
deck. 50 .

There were the two watchmen, sure 
enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff 
. as a handspike, with his arms stretched y 3 out like those of a crucifix, and his 
teeth showing through his open lips; 
Israel Hands propped against the 
bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his 
hands lying open before him on the 
deck, his face as white, under its tan, 
as a tallow candle. / 
For a while the ship kept bucking 
and sidling like a vicious horse, the 
sails filling, now on one tack, now on 
another, and the boom swinging to 
and fro till the mast groaned aloud 
under the strain. Now and again, 
too, there would come a cloud ‘of 
light sprays over the bulwark, and 
a heavy blow of the ship’s bows 
against the swell; so much heavier 
weather was made of it by this great 
rigged ship than by my homemade 
lopsided coracle, now gone to the 
bottom of the sea. 
At every jump of the schooner, red- 
cap slipped to and fro; but—what was: 
ghastly to behold—neither his atti- 
tude nor his fixed, teeth-disclosing 
grin was anyway disturbed by this 
rough usage. At every jump, too, 
Hands appeared still more to sink 
into himself and settle down upon 
the deck, his feet sliding ever the 
farther out, and the whole body cant- 
ing toward the stern, so that his face 
became, little by little, hid from me; 
and at last I could see nothing beyond 
his ear and the frayed ringlet of one 
whisker. : 
At the same time, I observed, 
around both of them, splashes of dark 
blood upon the planks, and began to 
feel sure that they had killed each 
other in their drunken wrath. 
While I was thus looking and won- 
dering, in a calm moment, when the 
ship was still, Israel Hands turned 
partly round, and, with a low. moan, 
writhed himself back to the position THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
in which I had seen him first. 
moan, which told of pain and deadly 
weakness, and the way in which his 
jaw hung open, went right to my 
heart. But when I remembered the 
talk I had overheard from the apple 
barrel, all pity left me. 
I walked aft until I reached the 
mainmast. 
“Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said 
ironically. 
He rolled his eyes round heavily; 
but he was too far gone to express 
surprise. All he could do was to 
utter one word, “Brandy.” 
It occurred to me there was no 
time to lose; and, dodging the boom 
as it once more lurched across the 
deck, I slipped aft, and down the 
companion stairs into the cabin. 
It was such a scene of confusion as 
you can hardly fancy. All the lock- 
fast places had been broken open in 
quest of the chart. The floor was 
thick with mud, where ruffians had 
sat down to drink or consult after 
wading in the marshes round their 
camp. The bulkheads, all painted in 
clear white, and beaded round with 
gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands. 
Dozens of empty bottles clinked to- 
gether in corners to the rolling of the 
ship. One of the doctor’s medical 
books Jay open on the table, half of 
the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for 
pipelights. In the midst of all this 
the lamp still cast a smoky glow, ob- 
scure and brown as umber. 
I went into the cellar; all the bar- 
rels were gone, and of the bottles a 
most surprising number had been 
drunk out and thrown away. Cer- 
tainly, since the mutiny began, not a 
man of them could ever have been 
sober. 
Foraging about, I found a bottle 
with some brandy left, for Hands; 
and for myself I routed out some bis- 
cuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch The 3

of raisins, and a piece of cheese. With 
these I came on deck, put down my 
own stock behind the rudder-head, 
and well out of the coxswain’s reach, 
went forward to the water breaker, 
and had a good, deep drink of water, 
and then, and not till then, gave 
Hands the brandy. 
He must have drunk a gill before 
he took the bottle from his mouth. 
“Aye,” said he, “by thunder, but 
I wanted some o’ that!” 
I had sat down already in my own 
corner and begun to eat. 
“Much hurt?” I asked him. 
He grunted, or, rather, I might say, 
barked. 
“Tf that doctor was aboard,” he 
said, “I’d be right enough in a couple 
of turns; but I don’t have no manner 
of luck, you see, and that’s what’s the 
matter with me. As for that swab, 
he’s good and dead, he is,”’ he added, 
indicating the man with the red cap. 
“He warn’t no seaman, anyhow. 
And where mought you have come 
from?” 
“Well,” said I, “I’ve come aboard 
to take possession of this ship, Mr. 
Hands; and you'll please regard me 
as your captain until further notice.” 
He looked at me sourly enough, but 
said nothing. Some of the color had 
come back into his cheeks, though he 
still looked very sick, and still con- 
tinued to slip out and settle down as 
the ship banged about. 
“By-the-by,” I continued, “I can’t 
have these colors, Mr. Hands; and, 
by your leave, I’ll strike em. Better 
none than these.” 
And, again dodging the boom, I 
ran to the color lines, handed down 
their cursed black flag and chucked 
it overboard. 
“God save the king!” said I, wav- 
‘ing my cap; “and there’s an end to 
Captain Silver!’ 
He watched me keenly and slyly, 163 
his chin all the while on his breast. 
“T reckon,” he said at last—“I 
reckon, Cap’n Hawkins, you'll kind of 
want to get ashore, now. S’pose we 
talks.” 
“Why, yes,” says I, “with all my 
heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.” And 
I went back to my meal. with a good 
appetite. 
“This man,’ he began, nodding 
feebly at the corpse—“O’Brien were 
his name—a rank Irelander—this man 
and me got the canvas on her, mean- 
ing for to sail her back. Well, he’s 
dead now, he is—as dead as bilge; 
and who’s to sail this ship, I don’t see. 
Without I gives you a hint, you ain’t 
that man, as far’s I can tell. Now, 
look here, you gives me food and 
drink, and a old scarf or ankeclfer to 
tie my wound up, you do; and I'll 
tell you how to sail her; and that’s 
about square all round, I take it.” 
“Tl tell you one thing,” says [; 
“T’m not going back to Captain Kidd’s 
anchorage. I mean to get into North 
Inlet, and beach her quietly there.” 
“To be sure you did,” he cried. 
“Why, I ain’t sich an infernal lubber, 
after all. I can see, can’t I? T’ve 
tried my fling, I have, and I’ve lost, 
and it’s you has the wind of me. 
North Inlet? Why, I have-no ch’ice, 
not I! I’d help you sail her up to 
Execution Dock, by thunder! so I 
would.” 
Well, as it seemed to me, there was 
some serise in this. We struck our 
bargain on the spot. In three min- 
utes I had the Hispaniola sailing 
easily before the wind along the coast 
of Treasure Island, with good hopes 
of turning the northern point ere noon, 
and beating down again as far as 
North Inlet before high water, when 
we might beach her safely, and wait 
till the subsiding tide permitted us to 
land.

Then I lashed the tiller and went 
below to my own chest, where I got a 
soft silk handkerchief of my mother’s. 
With this, and with my aid, Hands 
bound up the great bleeding stab 
he had received in the thigh, and after 
he had eaten a little and had a swallow 
or two more of the brandy, he began 
to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, 
spoke louder and clearer, and looked 
in every way another man. 
The breeze served us admirably. 
We skimmed before it like a bird, the 
coast of the island flashing by, and 
the view changing every minute. 
Soon we were past the highlands and 
bowling beside low, sandy country, 
sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and 
soon we were beyond that again, and 
had turned the corner of the rocky 
hill that ends the island on the north. 
I was greatly elated with my new 
command, and pleased with the bright, 
sunshiny weather and these different. 
prospects of the coast. I had now 
plenty of water and good things to 
eat, and my conscience, which had 
smitten me hard for my desertion, was 
quieted by the great conquest I had 
made. I should, I think, have had 
nothing left me to desire but for the 
eyes of the coxswain as they followed 
me derisively about the deck, and the 
odd smile that appeared continually 
on his face. It was a smile that had 
in it something both of pain and weak- 
ness—a haggard, old man’s smile; 
but there was, besides that, a grain of 
derision, a shadow of treachery, in his 
expression as he craftily watched, and 
watched, and watched me at my work. 
CHAPTER XXVI

The wind, serving us to a desire, 
now hauled into the west. . We could 
run so much the easier from the north- THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
east corner of the island to the mouth 
of the North Inlet. Only, as we had 
no power to anchor, and dared not 
beach her till the tide had flowed a 
good deal farther, time hung on our 
hands. The coxswain told me how to 
lay the ship to; after a good many 
trials I succeeded, and we both sat in 
silence, over another meal. 
“Cap’n,” said he, at length, with 
that same uncomfortable smile, “‘here’s 
my old shipmate, O’Brien; s’pose you 
was to heave him overboard. I ain’t 
partic’lar as a rule, and I don’t take 
no blame for settling his hash; but I 
don’t reckon him ornamental, now, 
do you?” 
“T’m not strong enough, and I don’t 
like the job; and there he lies, for me,”’ 
said I. 
“This here’s an unlucky ship—this 
Hispaniola, Jim,” he went on, blink- 
ing. “There’s a power of men been 
killed in this Hispaniola—a sight o’ 
poor seamen dead and gone since you 
and me took ship to Bristol. Inever 
seen sich dirty luck, not I. There 
was this here O’Brien, now—he’s 
dead, ain’t he? Well, now, I’m no 
scholar, and you’re a lad as can read 
and figure; and to put it straight, 
do you take it as a dead man is dead 
for good, or do he come alive again?”’ 
“You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, 
but not the spirit; you must know 
that already,” I replied. “O’Brien 
there is in another world, and may be 
watching us.” 
“Ah!” says he. ‘Well, that’s un- 
fort’nate—appears as if killing parties 
was a waste of time. Howsomever, 
sperrits don’t reckon for much, by 
what I’ve seen. J’ll chance it with 
the sperrits, Jim. And now, you’ve 
spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if 
you’d step down into that there cabin

  TREASURE ISLAND 
Jim—this here btandy’s too strong 
for my head.” 
Now, the ‘ coxswain’s hesitation 
seemed to be unnatural; and as for 
the notion of his preferring wine to 
brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. 
The whole story was a pretext. He 
wanted me to leave the deck—so 
much was plain; but with what pur- 
pose I could in no way imagine. His 
eyes never met mine; they kept 
wandering to and fro, up and down, 
now with a look to the sky, now with 
a flitting glance upon the dead O’Brien. 
All the time he kept smiling, and 
putting his tongue out in the most 
guilty, embarrassed manner, so that 
a child could have told that he was 
bent on some deception. I was 
prompt with my answer, however, 
for I saw where my advantage lay; 
and that with a fellow so densely 
stupid I could easily conceal my 
suspicions to the end. 
“Some wine?” I said. ‘Far better. 
Will you have white or red?” 
‘Well, I reckon it’s about the blessed 
same to me, shipmate,”’ he replied; 
“so it’s strong, and plenty of it, what’s 
the odds?” 
“All right,” I answered. 
you port, Mr. Hands. 
dig for it.” 
With that I scuttled down the 
companion with all the noise I could, 
slipped off my shoes, ran quietly 
along the sparred gallery, mounted the 
forecastle ladder, and popped my 
head out of the fore companion. I 
knew he would not expect to see me 
there; yet I took every precaution 
possible; and certainly the worst of 
my suspicions proved too true. 
He had risen from his position to 
his hands and knees; and, though 
his leg obviously hurt him pretty 
sharply when he moved—for I could 
hear him stifle.a groan—yet it was 
at a good, rattling rate that he trailed “Tl bring 
But I'll have to 165 
himself across the deck. In half a 
minute he had reached the port 
scuppers, and picked, out of a coil 
of rope, a long knife, or rather a short 
dirk, discolored to the hilt with blood. 
He looked upon it for a ‘moment, 
thrusting forth his under jaw, tried 
the point upon his hand, and then, 
hastily concealing it in the bosom of 
his jacket, trundled back again into 
his old place against the bulwark. 
This was all that I required to 
know. Israel could move about; he 
was now armed; and if he had been 
at so much trouble to get rid of me, 
it was plain that I was meant to be 
the victim. What he would do after- 
wards—whether. he would try to 
crawl right across the island from 
North Inlet to the camp among the 
swamps, or whether he would fire 
Long Tom, trusting that his own 50 
comrades might come first to help ~ 
him, was, of course, more than I could 
say. 
Yet I felt sure that I could trust 
him in one point, since in that our 
interests jumped together, and that 
was in the disposition of the schooner. 
We both desired to have her stranded 
safe enough, in a sheltered place, and 
so that, when the time came, she 
could be got off again with as little 
labor and danger as might be; and 
until that was done I considered that 
my life would certainly be spared. 
While I was thus turning the busi- 
ness over in my mind, I had not been 
idle with my body. I had stolen back 
to the cabin, slipped once more into 
my shoes, and laid my hand at random 
on a bottle of wine, and now, with - 
this for an excuse, I made my reap- 
pearance on the deck. 
Hands lay as I had left him, all 
fallen together in a bundle, and with 
his eyelids lowered, as though he 
were too weak to bear the light. He 
looked up, however, at my coming, 80

knocked the neck off the bottle, like 
a man who had done the same thing 
often, and took a good swig, with his 
favorite toast of “Here’s luck!” Then 
he lay quiet for a little, and then, 
pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged 
me to cut him a quid. 
“Cut me a junk o’ that,” says he, 
“for I haven’t no knife, and hardly 
strength enough, so be as Thad. Ah, 
Jim, Jim, I reckon I’ve missed stays! 
Cut me a quid, as’ll likely be the last, 
lad; for I’m for my long home, and 
no mistake.” 
“Well,” said I, “Pll cut you some 
tobacco; but if I was you and thought 
myself so badly, I would go to my 
prayers, like a Christian man.” 
“Why?” said he. “Now, you tell 
me why.” 
“Why?” I cried. “You were ask- 
ing me just now about the dead. 
you’ve 
lived in sin and lies and blood; there’s 
a man you killed lying at your feet 
this moment; and you ask me why! 
For God’s mercy Mr. Hands, that’s 
why.” 
I spoke with a little heat, thinking 
of the bloody dirk he had hidden in 
his pocket, and designed, in his ill 
thoughts, to end me with. He, for 
his part, took a great draught of the 
wine, and spoke with the most un- 
usual solemnity. 
“For thirty years,” he said, “I’ve 
sailed the seas, and seen good and bad, 
better and. worse, fair weather and 
foul, provisions running out, knives 
going, and what not. Well, now I 
tell you, I never seen good come 0” 
goodness yet. Him as strikes first is 
my fancy; dead men don’t bite; 
them’s my views—amen, so be it. 
And now, you look here,” he added, 
suddenly changing his tone, “we’ve 
had about enough of this foolery.

10 So he issued his commands, which 
I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a 
sudden, he cried, “Now, my hearty, 
luff? And I put the helm hard up, 
and the Hispaniola swung round 
rapidly, and ran stem on for the low, 
wooded shore. 
; ‘The excitement of these last maneu- 
vers had somewhat interfered with the 
watch I had kept hitherto, sharply 
I» enough, upon the coxswain. Even 
then I was still so much interested, 
waiting for the ship to touch, that I 
* had quite forgot the peril that hung 
over my head, and stood craning over 
the starboard bulwarks and watching 
the ripples spreading wide before the 
bows. I might have fallen without 
astruggle for my life, had not a sudden 
disquietude seized upon me, and made 
20 me turn my head. Perhaps I had 
heard a creak, or seen his shadow 
{ moving with the tail of my eye; 
{| perhaps it was an instinct like a cat’s; 
but, sure enough, when I looked 
round, there was Hands, already 
halfway toward me, with the dirk 
in his right hand. 
\} We must both have cried out aloud 
when our eyes met; but while mine 
0 was the shrill cry of terror, his was 
a roar of fury like a charging bull’s. 
At the same instant he threw himself 
forward, and I leaped sideways toward 
the bows. As I did so, I Jet go of the 
tiller, which sprang sharp to leeward; 
and I think this saved my life, for it 
struck Hands across the chest, and 
stopped him, for the moment, dead. 
Before he could recover, I was safe 167 
out of the corner where he had me so 
trapped, with all the deck to dodge 
about. Just forward of the main- 
mast, I stopped, drew a pistol from 
my pocket, took a cool aim, though 
he had already turned and was once 
more coming directly after me, and 
drew the trigger. The hammer fell, 
but there followed neither flash nor 
sound; the priming was useless with 
sea water. I cursed myself for my cc 
neglect. Why had not I, long before, 
reprimed and reloaded my only 
weapons? Then I should not have 
been, as now, a mere fleeing sheep 
before this butcher. : 
Wounded as he was, it was wonder- 
ful how fast he could move, his 
grizzled hair tumbling over his face, 
and his face itself as red as aredensign _ 
with his haste and fury. I had no 70 
time to try my other pistol, nor, 
indeed, much inclination, for I was 
sure it would be useless. One thing 
I saw plainly: I must not simply 
retreat before him, or he would 
speedily hold me boxed into the bows, 
as a moment since he had so nearly 
boxed me in the stern. Once so 
caught, and nine or ten inches of the 
blood-stained dirk would be my last so 
experience on this side of eternity. 
I placed my palms against the main- 
mast, which was of a goodish bigness, 
and waited, every nerve upon the 
stretch. 
Seeing that I meant to dodge, he 
also paused; and a moment or two 
passed in feints on his part, and corre- 
sponding movements upon mine. It 
was such a game as I had often played 90 
at home about the rocks of Black Hill 
Cove; but never before, you may be 
sure, with such a wildly beating heart 
as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy’s 
game, and I thought I could hold my 
own at it, against an elderly seaman 
with a wounded thigh. Indeed, my 
courage had begun to rise so high that
-P-A-G-E-177
10 
40 168 
I allowed myself a few darting 
thoughts on what would be the end of 
the affair; and while I saw certainly 
that I could spin it out for long, I 
saw no hope of any ultimate escape. 
Well, while things stood thus, sud- 
denly the Hispaniola struck, stag- 
gered, ground for an instant in the 
sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted 
over to the port side, till the deck 
stood at an angle of forty-five degrees, 
and about a puncheon of water 
splashed into the scupper holes, and 
lay, in a pool, between the deck and 
bulwark. 
We were both of us capsized in a 
second, and both of us rolled, almost 
together, into the scuppers; the dead 
red-cap, with his arms still spread out, 
tumbling stiffly after us. So near 
were we, indeed, that my head came 
against the coxswain’s foot with a 
crack that made my teeth rattle. 
Blow and all, I was the first afoot 
again; for Hands had got involved 
with the dead body. The sudden 
canting of the ship had made the deck 
no place for running on; I had to find 
some new way of escape, and that 
upon the instant, for my foe was al- 
most touching me. Quick as thought 
I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, 
rattled up hand over hand, and did not 
draw a breath till I was seated on the 
crosstrees. 
I had been saved by being prompt; 
the dirk had struck not half a foot 
below me, as I pursued my upward 
flight; and there stood Israel Hands 
with his mouth open and his face 
upturned to mine, a perfect statue of 
surprise and disappointment. 
Now that I had a moment to my- 
self, I lost no time in changing the 
priming of my pistol, and then, having 
one ready for service, and to make 
assurance doubly sure,.I proceeded to 
draw the load of the other, and re- 
charge it afresh from the beginning. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
My new employment struck ||

sure it was without a conscious aim— 
both. my pistols went off, and both 
escaped out of my hands. They did 
not fall alone; with a choked cry, 
the coxswain loosed his grasp upon 
the shrouds, and plunged head first 
into the water. 
CHAPTER XXVII 
“Pieces or E1eur” 
Owing to the cant of the vessel, the 
masts hung far out over the water, 
and from my perch on the crosstrees 
I had nothing below me but the sur- 
face of the hay. Hands, who was 
not so far up, was, in consequence, 
nearer to the ship, and fell between 
me and the bulwarks. He rose once 
to the surface in a lather of foam 
and blood, and then sank again for 
good. As the water settled, I could 
see him lying huddled together on 
the clean, bright sand in the shadow 
of the vessel’s sides. A fish or two 
whipped past his body. Sometimes, 
by the quivering of the water, he 
appeared to move a little, as if he 
were trying to rise. But he was dead 
enough, for all that, being both shot 
and drowned, and was food for fish 
in the very place where he had de- 
signed my slaughter. 
I was no sooner certain of this than 
I began to feel sick, faint, and terrified. 
The hot blood was running over my 
back and chest. The dirk, where it 
had pinned my shoulder to the mast, 
seemed to burn like a hot iron; yet 
it was not so much these real sufferings 
that distressed me, for these, it seemed 
to me, I could bear without a murmur; 
it was the horror I had upon my mind 
of falling from the crosstrees into that 
still, green water, beside the body 
of the coxswain. 
T clung with both hands” till my 
nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if 
a 169 
to cover up the peril. Gradually my 
mind came back again, my pulses 
quieted down to a more natural time, 
and I was once more in possession of 
myself. - 
It was my first thought to pluck 
forth the dirk; but either it stuck too 
hard or my nerve failed me; and I 
desisted with a violent shudder. Odd- 
ly enough, that very shudder did the 
business. The knife, in fact, had 
come the nearest in the world to 
missing me altogether; it held me 
by a mere pinch of skin, and this the 
shudder tore away. The blood ran 
down the faster, to be sure; but I 
was my own master again, and only 
tacked to the mast by my coat and 
shirt. 
These last I broke through with a 
sudden jerk, and then regained the 
deck by the starboard shrouds. For 
nothing in the world would I -have 
again ventured, shaken as I was, 
upon the overhanging port shrouds, 
from which Israel had so lately fallen. 
I went below, and did what I could 
for my wound; it pained me a good 
deal, and still bled freely; but it was 
neither deep nor dangerous, nor did 
it greatly gall me when I used my 
arm. Then I looked around me, 
and as_the ship was now, in a sense, 
my own, I began to think of clearing 
it from its last passenger—the dead 
man, O’Brien. 
’ He had pitched,-as I have said, 
against the bulwarks, where he lay 
like some horrible, ungainly sort of 
puppet; life-size, indeed, but how 
different from life’s color or life’s 
comeliness! In that position, I could 
easily have my way with him; and 
as the habit of tragical adventures 
had worn off almost all my terror for 
the dead, I took him by the waist as if 
he had been a sack of bran, and with 
one good heave, tumbled him over- 
board. He went in with a sounding 50
-P-A-G-E-179

20 170 
plunge; the red cap came off, and 
remained floating on the surface; and 
as soon as the splash subsided, I 
could see him and Israel lying side by 
side, both wavering with the tremulous 
movement of the water. O’Brien, 
though still quite a young man, was 
very bald. There he lay, with that 
bald head across the knees of the 
man who had killed him, and the 
quick fishes steering to and fro over 
both. 
I was now alone upon the ship; the 
tide had just turned. The sun was 
within so few degrees of setting 
that already the shadow of the pines 
upon the western shore began to 
reach right across the anchorage, and 
fall in patterns on the deck. The 
evening breeze had sprung up, and 
though it was well: warded off by the 
hill with the two peaks upon the east, 
the cordage had begun to sing a littlé 
softly to itself and the idle sails to 
rattle to and fro. 
I began to see a danger to the ship. 
The jibs I speedily doused and brought 
tumbling to the deck; but the main- 
sail was a harder matter. 
when the schooner canted over, the 
boom had swung outboard, and the 
cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung 
even under water. I thought this 
made it still more dangerous; yet 
the strain was so heavy that I half 
feared to meddle. At last I got my 
knife and cut the halyards. The 
peak dropped instantly, a great belly 
of loose canvas floated broad upon 
the water; and since, pull as I liked, 
I could not budge the downhaul, that 
was the extent of what I could ac- 
complish. For the rest, the His- 
paniola must trust to luck, like my- 
_ self. 
By this time the whole anchorage 
had fallen into shadow—the last rays, 
I remember, falling through a glade 
of the wood, and shining bright as Of course, - THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
jewels, on the flowery mantlé of th. 
wreck. It began to be chill; the tic. 
was rapidly fleeting seaward, tk 
schooner settling more and more on 
her beam-ends. 
I scrambled forward and looked 
over. It seemed shallow enough, and 
holding the cut hawser in both hands 
for a last security, I let myself drop 
softly overboard. The water scarcely 
reached my waist; the sand was firm 
and covered with ripple marks, and 
I waded ashore in great spirits, leaving 
the Hispaniola on her side, with her 
mainsail trailing wide upon the sur- 
face of the bay.. About the same 
time the sun went fairly down, and 
the breeze whistled low in the dusk 
among the tossing pines. 
At least, and at last, I was off the 
sea, nor had I returned thence empty- 
handed. There lay the schooner, 
clear at last from buccaneers and 
ready for our own men to board and 
get to Sea again. I had nothing 
nearer my fancy than to get home to 
the stockade and boast of my achieve- 
ments. Possibly I might be blamed a 
bit for my truantry, but the recapture 
of the Hispaniola was a clenching 
answer, and I hoped that even Captain 
Smollett would confess I had not lost 
my time. 
So thinking, and in famous spirits, 
I began to set my face homeward for 
the block-house and my companions. 
I remembered that the most easterly 
of the rivers which drain into Captain 
Kidd’s anchorage ran from the two- 
peaked hill upon my left; and I bent 
my course in that direction that I 
might pass the stream while it was 
small. The wood was pretty open, 
and keeping along the lower spurs, I 
had soon turned the corner of that 
hill, and not long after waded to the 
mid-calf. across the water-course. 
This brought me near to where I 
had encountered Ben Gunn, the ma-

roon; and I walked more circum- 
spectly, keeping an eye on every side. 
The dusk had come nigh hand com- 
pletely, and, as I opened out the cleft 
between the two peaks, I became 
aware of a wavering glow against the 
sky, where, as I judged, the man of 
the island was cooking his supper ~ 
before a roaring fire. And yet I 
wondered, in my heart, that he should 
show himself so-careless. For if I 
could see this radiance, might it not 
reach the eyes of Silver himself where 
he camped upon the shore among the 
marshes? 
Gradually the night fell blacker; it 
was all I could do to guide myself 
even roughly toward my destination; 
the double hill behind me and the 
Spyglass on my right hand loomed 
faint and fainter; the stars were few 
and pale; and in the low ground 
where I wandered I kept tripping 
among bushes and rolling into sandy 
pits. 
Suddenly a kind of brightness fell 
about me. I looked up; a pale 
glimmer of moonbeams had alighted 
on the summit of the Spyglass, and 
soon after I saw something broad 
and silvery moving low down behind 
the trees, and knew the moon had 
risen. 
With this to help me, I passed 
rapidly over what remained to me of 
my journey; and, sometimes walking, 
sometimes running, impatiently drew 
near to the stockade. Yet, as I began 
to thread the grove that lies before it, 
I was not so thoughtless but that I 
slacked my pace and went a trifle 
warily. It would have been a poor 
end of my adventures to get shot down 
by my own party in mistake. 
The moon was climbing higher and 
higher; its light began to fall here 
and there in masses through the more 
open districts of the wood; and right 
3. nigh hand, almost, nearly. 171 
in front of me a glow of.a different 
color appeared among the trees. It 
was red and hot, and now and again 
it was a little darkened—-as. it were 
the embers of a bonfire smoldering. 
For the life of me, I could not think 
what it might be. 
At last I came right down upon 
the borders of the clearing. The 
western end was already steeped in 
moonshine; the rest, and the block- 
house itself, still lay in a black shadow, 
checkered with long, silvery streaks of 
light. On the other side of the house: 
an immense fire had burned itself 
into clear embers and shed a steady, 
red reverberation, contrasted strongly 
with the mellow paleness of the moon. 
There was not. a soul stirring, nor 
a sound besides the noises of the 
breeze. 
I stopped, with much wonder in 
my heart, and perhaps a little terror 
also. It had not been our way to 
build great fires; we were, indeed, by 
the captain’s orders, somewhat nig- 
gardly of firewood; and I began to 
fear that something had gone wrong 
while I was absent. 
I stole round by the eastern end, 
keeping close, in shadow, and at a 
convenient place, where the darkness 
was thickest, crossed the palisade. 
To make assurance surer, I got 
upon my hands and knees, and 
crawled, without a sound, toward the 
corner of the house. As I drew 
nearer, my heart was suddenly and 
greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant 
noise in itself, and I have often com- 
plained of it at other times; but just 
then it was like music to hear my 
friends snoring together so loud and 
peaceful in their sleep. The sea cry 
of the watch, that beautiful “‘All’s 
well,” never fell more reassuringly on 
my ear. 
In the meantime, there was no 
doubt of one thing; they kept an 80
-P-A-G-E-181

20 172 
infamous bad watch. If it had been 
Silver and his lads that were now 
creeping in on them, not a soul would 
have seen daybreak. That was what 
it was, thought I, to have the captain 
wounded; and again I blamed my- 
self sharply for leaving them in that 
danger with so few to mount guard. 
By this time I had got to the door 
and stood up. All was dark within, 
so that I could distinguish nothing by 
the eye. As for sounds, there was the 
steady drone of the snorers, and a 
small, occasional noise, a flickering or 
pecking that I could in no way account 
for. 
With my arms before me I walked 
steadily in. I should lie down in my 
own place (I thought, with a silent 
chuckle) and enjoy their faces when 
they found me in the morning. 
My foot struck something yielding 
—it was a sleeper’s leg; and he 
turned and groaned, but without 
awaking. 
And then, all of a sudden, a shrill 
voice broke forth out of the darkness: THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“Pieces of eight! pieces of eight! 
pieces of eight! pieces of eight! pieces 
of eight!” and so forth, without pause 
or change, like the clacking of a tiny 
mill. 
Silver’s green parrot, Captain Flint! 
It was she whom I had heard pecking at 
a piece of bark; it was she, keeping 
better watch than any human being, 
who thus announced my arrival with 
her wearisome refrain. 
I had no time left me to recover. 
At the sharp, clipping tone of the 
parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang 
up; and with a mighty oath, the voice 
of Silver cried: 
“Who goes?” 
I turned to run, struck violently 
against one person, recoiled, and ran 
full into the arms of a second, who, 
for his part, closed upon and held me 
tight. 
“Bring a torch, Dick,” said Silver, 
when my capture was thus assured. 
And one of the men left the log- 
house and presently returned with a 
lighted brand.

PART VI 
CAPTAIN SILVER 
CHAPTER XXVIII 
In roe Enemy’s Camp 
The red glare of the torch, lighting 
up the interior of the block-house, 
showed me the worst of my appre- 
hensions realized. The pirates were 
in possession of the house and stores: 
there was the cask of cognac, there 
were the pork and bread, as before; 
and, what tenfold increased my horror, 
not a sign of any prisoner. I could 
0 only judge that all had perished, and 
my heart smote me sorely that IT had 
not been there to perish with them. 
There were six of the buccaneers, 
all told; not another man was left 
alive, Five of them were on their 
feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly 
called out of the first sleep of drunken- 
ness. The sixth had only risen upon 
his elbow: he was deadly pale, and 
» the bloodstained bandage round his 
head told that he had recently been 
wounded, and still more recently 
dressed. I remembered the man who 
had been shot, and had run back 
among the woods in the great attack, 
and doubted not that this was he. 
The parrot sat, preening her plu- 
mage, on Long John’s shoulder. He 
himself, I thought, looked somewhat 
3% paler and more stern than I was used 
to. He still wore the fine broadcloth 
suit in which he had fulfilled his mis- 
sion, but it was bitterly the worse for 
wear, daubed with clay and torn with 
the sharp briers of the wood. 
“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Haw- 
kins, shiver my timbers! dropped in, 
like, eh? Well, come, I take that 
friendly.” And thereupon he sat down 
# across the brandy cask, and began to 
fill a pipe. 
“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a 
good light, “that’ll do, lad,” he 
added; “stick the glim in the wood 
heap; and you, gentlemen, bring 
yourselves to!—you needn’t stand up 
for Mr. Hawkins; he'll excuse you, 
you may lay to that. And so, Jim”— 
stopping the tobacco—“‘here you were, 
and quite a pleasant surprise for poor 
old John: I see you were smart when 
first I set my eyes on you; but this 
here gets away from me clean, it do.” 
To all this, as may be well supposed, 
I made no answer. They had set 
me with my back against the wall; 
and I stood there, looking Silver in 
the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to 
all outward appearance, but with 
black despair in my heart. 
Silver took a whiff or two of his 
pipe with great composure, and then 
Tan on again. 
“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you 
are here,” says he, “I'll give you a 
piece of my mind. I’ve always liked 
you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and 
the picter of my own self when I was 
young and handsome. I always 
wanted you to jine and take your 
share, and die a gentleman, and now, 
my cock, you’ve got to. Cap’n Smol- 
lett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to 
any day, but stiff on discipline. 
‘Dooty is dooty,’ says he, and right 
he is. Just you keep clear of the 
cap’n. The doctor himself is gone 
dead again you—‘ungrateful scamp’ 
was what he said; and the short and 
the long of the whole story is about 
here: you can’t go back to your own 
lot, for they won’t have you; and 
without you start a third ship’s com- 
pany all by yourself, which might be 
lonely, you'll have to jine with Cap’n 
Silver.” . 173

So far so good. My friends, then, 
were still alive, and though I partly 
believed the truth of Silver’s state- 
ment, that the cabin party were in- 
censed at me for my desertion, I was 
more relieved than distressed by what 
I heard. 
“JT don’t say nothing as to your 
being in our hands,” continued Silver, 
“though there you are, and you may 
lay to it I’m all for argyment; I never 
seen good come out o’ threatening. 
Tf you like the service, well, you'll jine; 
and if you don’t, Jim, why, you're 
free to answer no—free and welcome, 
shipmate; and if fairer can be said by 
mortal seaman, shiver my sides!” 
“Am I to answer, then?” I asked, 
with a very tremulous voice. Through 
all this sneering talk, I was made to 
feel the threat of death that overhung 
me, and my cheeks burned and my 
heart beat painfully in my breast. 
“Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s 
a-pressing of you. Take your bear- 
ings. None of us won’t hurry you, 
mate; time goes so pleasant in your 
company, you see.” 
“Well,” says I, growing a bit bolder, 
“if I’m to choose, I declare I have a 
right to know what’s what, and why 
you’re here, and where my friends 
are.” . 
““Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the 
buccaneers, in a deep growl. “Ah, 
he’d be a lucky one as knowed that!” 
“You'll, perhaps, batten down your 
hatches till you’re spoke, my friend,” 
cried Silver truculently to this speaker. 
And then, in his first gracious tones, 
he replied to me: “Yesterday morn- 
ing, Mr. Hawkins,” said he, “in the 
dogwatch, down came Dr. Livesey 
with a flag of truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n 
Silver, you’re sold out. Ship’s gone.’ 
Well, maybe we’d been taking a glass, 
and a song to help it round. I won’t 
say no. Leastways none of us had 
37. batten down your hatches, keep still. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
looked out. We looked out, and, by 
thunder! the old ship was gone. I ; 
never seen a pack o’ fools look fishier, 
and you may lay to that, if I tells you 
that looked the fishiest. ‘Well,’ says 
the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.” We bar- 
gained, him and J, and here we are: 
stores, brandy, block-house, the fire- 
wood you was thoughtful enough to 
cut, and, in a manner of speaking, 
the whole blessed boat, from cross- 
trees to keelson. As for them, they’ve | 
tramped; I don’t know where’s they are.” : 
He drew again quietly at his pipe. 
“And lest you should take it into 
that head of yours,” he went on, 
“that you was included in the treaty, 
here’s the last word that was said: 
‘How many are you,’ says I, ‘to 
leave?’ ‘Four,’ says he—‘four, and 
one of us wounded. - As for that boy, | 
I don’t know where he is, confound 
him,’ says he, ‘nor I don’t much care. 
We’re about sick of him.’ ‘These was 
his words.” 
“Ts that all?” I asked. 
“Well, it’s all that you’re to hear, 
my son,” returned Silver. 
‘And now J am to choose?” 
“And now you are to choose, and 
you may lay to that,” said Silver. 
“Well,” said I, “I’m not such a fool 
but I know pretty well what I have to 
look for. Let the worst come to the 
worst, it’s little I care. I’ve seen too 
many die since I fell in with you. 
But there’s a thing or two I have to 
tell you,” I said, and by this time I 
was quite excited; ‘and the first is 
this: here you are, in a bad way: 
ship lost, treasure lost, men lost; your 
whole business gone to wreck; and if 
you want to know who did it—it was 
I—I was in the apple barrel the night 
we sighted land, and I heard you, 
John, and you, Dick Johnson, and 
Hands, who is now at the bottom of 
the sea, and told every word you said

| TREASURE ISLAND 
before the hour was out. And as for 
the schooner, it was I who cut her 
cable, and it was I that killed the 
men you had aboard of her, and it 
was I who brought her where you’ll 
never see her more, not one of you. 
The laugh’s on my side; I’ve had the 
top of this business from the first; 
I no more fear you than I fear a fly. 
10 Kill me, if you please, or spare me. 
But one thing I’ll say, and no more; 
if you spare me, bygones are bygones, 
and when you fellows are in court for 
piracy, Pll save you all I can. It is 
for you to choose. Kill another and 
do yourselves no good, or spare me 
and keep a witness to save you from 
the gallows.” 
I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out 
2 of breath, and, to my wonder, not a 
man of them moved, but all sat staring 
at me like as many sheep. And while 
they were still staring, I broke out 
again: 
“And now, Mr. Silver,” I said, “I 
believe you’re the best man here, and 
if things go to the worst, I'll take it kind 
of you to let the doctor know the way 
I took it.” 
30 ©6«“T’ll bear it in mind,” said Silver, 
with an accent so curious that I could 
not, for the life of me, decide whether 
he were laughing at my request, or had 
been favorably affected by my cour- 
age. 
“Tl put one to that,” cried the old 
mahogany-faced seaman—Morgan by 
name—whom I had seen in Long 
John’s public-house upon the quays 
of Bristol. “It was him that knowed 
Black Dog.” 
“Well, and see here,” 
sea cook, “T’ll put another again to 
that, by thunder! for it was this same 
boy that faked the chart from Billy 
Bones. First and last, we’ve split 
upon Jim Hawkins!” 
“Then here goes!” said Morgan, 
with an oath. = - added the © V5 
And he sprang up, drawing his 
knife as if he had been twenty. 
“Avast there!” cried Silver. “Who 
are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you 
thought you was cap’n here, perhaps. 
By the powers, but I'll teach you 
better! Cross me, and you'll go where 
many a good man’s gone before you, 
first and last, these thirty year back— 
some to the yardarm, shiver my tim- 
bers! and some by the board, and all 
to feed the fishes. There’s never a 
man looked me between the eyes and 
seen a good day a’terwards, Tom 
Morgan, you may lay to that.” 
Morgan paused; but a hoarse 
murmur rose from the others. 
“Tom’s right,” said one. 
“I stood hazing long enough from 
one,” added another. “T’ll be hanged 
if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.” 
“Did any of you gentlemen want 
to have it out with me?” roared Silver, 
bending far forward from his position 
on the keg, with his pipe still glowing 
in his right hand. “Put a name on 
what you’re at; you ain’t dumb, I 
reckon. Him that wants shall get it. 
Have I lived this many years, and a 50 
son of a rum puncheon cock his hat — 
athwart my hawse at the latter end 
of it? You know the way; you're all 
gentlemen o’ fortune, by your account. 
Well, I’m ready. Take a cutlass, 
him that dares, and V’ll see the color 
of his inside, crutch and all, before 
that pipe’s empty.” 
Not a man stirred; not a man an- 
swered. 
“That’s your sort, is it?” he added, 
returning his pipe to his mouth. 
“Well, you're a gay lot to look at,

rats like you in this here house, and 
what I say is this: let me see him 
that'll lay a band on him—that’s 
what I say, and you may lay to it.” 
There was a long pause after this. 
I stood straight. up against the wall, 
my heart still going like a sledge 
hammer, but with a ray of hope now 
shining in my bosom. Silver leaned 
back against the wall, his arms 
crossed, his pipe in the corner of his 
mouth, as calm as though he had been 
in church; yet his eye kept wandering 
furtively, and he kept the tail of it 
on his unruly followers. They, on 
their part, drew gradually together 
toward the far end of the block-house, 
and the low hiss of their whispering 
sounded in my ear continuously, like 
a stream. 
One. after another they would look 
up, and the red light of the torch 
would fall for a second on their nerv- 
ous faces; but it was not toward me, 
it was toward Silver that. they turned 
their eyes. 
“You seem to have a » lot to say,” 
remarked Silver, spitting far into the 
air. “Pipe up and let me hear it, or 
lay to.” 
“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one 
of the men, “you’re pretty free with

John from swinging.” 
I was bewildered; it seemed a thing 
so hopeless he was asking—he, the 
old buccaneer, the ringleader through- 
out. 
“What I can do, that I'll do,” I 
said. 
“It’s a bargain!’ cried Long John. 
“You speak up plucky, and, by 
thunder! I’ve a chance.” 
He hobbled to the torch, where it 
stood propped among the firewood, 
and took a fresh light to his pipe. 
“Understand me, Jim,” he said, 
returning. “I’ve a head on my shoul- 
ders, I have. I’m on squire’s side 
now. I know you’ve got that ship 
safe somewheres. How you done it, 
I don’t know, but safe it is. I guess

know a lad that’s stanch. Ah, you 
that’s young—~you and me might have 
done a power of good together!” 
He drew some cognac from the cask 
into a tin cannikin. 
“Will you taste, messmate?’”’ he 
asked; and when I had refused: 
“Well, I'll take a drain myself, Jim,” 
said he. ‘TI need a calker, for there’s 
trouble on Jhand. And, talking o’ 
trouble, why did the doctor give me 
the chart, Jim?” 
My face expressed a wonder so 
unaffected that he saw needlessness of 
further questions. 
“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. 
“And there’s something under that, 
no doubt—something, surely, under 
that, Jim—bad or good.” 
And he took another swallow of the 
brandy, shaking his great fair head 
like a man who looks forward to the 
worst. 177 
CHAPTER XXIX 
Tue Brack Spor Aaain 
The council of the buccaneers had 
lasted some time when one of them 50 
reéntered the house, and with a 
repetition of the same salute, which 
had in my eyes an ironical air, begged 
for a moment’s. loan of the torch. 
Silver briefly agreed; and this emis- 
sary retired again, leaving us together 
in the dark. 
“There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” 
said Silver, who had, by this time, 
adopted quite a friendly and familiar 6o 
tone. . 
I turned to the loophole nearest me 
and looked out. The embers of the 
great fire had so far burned themselves 
out, and now glowed so low and 
duskily that I understood why these 
conspirators desired a torch. About 
halfway down the slope to the 
stockade, they were collected in a 
group; one held the light; 
was on his knees in their midst, and 
I saw the blade of an open knife shine 
in his hand with varying colors, in the 
moon and torchlight. The rest were 
all somewhat stooping, as though 
watching the maneuvers of this last. 
I could just make out that he had a 
book as well as a knife jn his hand; 
and was still wondering how any- 
thing so incongruous had come in 80 
their possession, when the kneeling 
figure rose once more to his feet, and 
the whole party began to move 
together toward the house. 
' “Here they come,” said I; and I 
returned to my former position, for 
it seemed beneath my dignity that 
they should find me watching them. 
“Well, let. °em come, lad—let ’em 
come,” said Silver, cheerily. 
still a shot in my locker.” 
The door opened, and the five men, 
standing huddled together, just in- another 70

side, pushed one of their number 
forward. In any other circumstances 
it would have been comical to see his 
slow advance, hesitating as he set 
down each foot, but holding his 
closed right hand in front of him. 
“Step up, lad,” cried Silver. “I 
won't eat-you. Hand it over, lubber. 
I know the rules, I do; I won’t hurt 
10 a depytation.” 
Thus encouraged, the buccaneer 
stepped forth more briskly, and hav- 
ing passed something to Silver, from 
hand to hand, slipped yet more 
smartly back again to his companions. 
The sea cook looked at what had 
‘been given him. “The black spot! I 
thought so,”’ he observed. 
“Where might you have got the 
20 paper? Why, hillo! look here, now: 
this ain’t lucky! You’ve gone and 
cut this out of a Bible. What fool’s 
cut a Bible?” 
“Ah, there!” said Morgan—“there! 
Wot did I say? No good’ll come o’ 
that, I said.” 
“Well, you’ve about fixed it now, 
{ among you,” continued Silver. ““You’ll 
all swing now, I reckon. What soft- 
30 headed lubber had a Bible?” 
‘ “It was Dick,’’ said one. 
“Dick, was it? Then Dick can get 
to prayers,” said Silver. “He’s seen 
his slice of luck, has Dick, and you 
may lay to that.” 
But here the long man with the 
yellow eyes struck in. : 
“Belay that talk, John Silver,” he 
said. ‘“This‘ crew has tipped you the 
40 black spot in full council, as in dooty 
bound; just you turn it over, as in 
deoty bound, and see what’s wrote 
there. Then you can talk.” 
“Thanky, George,”” replied the sea ” 
cook. “You always was brisk for 
business, and has the rules by heart, 
George, as I’m pleased to see. Well, 
what is it, anyway? Ah! ‘“Deposed’ 
—that’s it, is it? Very pretty wrote, THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
to be sure; like print, I swear. Your 4 
hand o’ write, George? Why, you 
was gettin’ quite a leadin’ man in this 
here crew. You'll be cap’n next, I 
shouldn’t wonder. Jest oblige me 
with that torch again, will you? This 
pipe don’t draw.” . 
“Come, now,” said George, “you 
don’t fool this crew no more. You're 
a funny man, by your account; but 
you’re over now, and you'll maybe 
step down off that barrel, and help 
vote.” : 
“T thought you said you knowed the 
tules,” returned Silver, contemptu- 
ously. “Leastways, if you don’t, I 
do; and I wait here—and I’m still 
your cap’n, mind—till you outs with 
your grievances, and I reply; in the 
meantime, your black spot ain’t worth 
a biscuit. After that, we'll see.” i 
“Oh,” replied George, “you don’t 
be under no kind of apprehension; 
we're all square, we are, First, you’ve 
made a hash of this cruise—you’ll be 
a bold man to say no to that. Second, 
you let the enemy out o’ this here 
trap for nothing. Why. did they 
want out? I dunno; but it’s pretty 
plain they wanted it. Third, you 
wouldn’t let us go at them upon the « 
march. Oh, we see through you, 
Jobn Silver; you want to play booty, 
that’s what’s wrong with you. And 
then, fourth, there’s this here boy.” 
“Ts that all?” asked Silver, quietly. 
“Enough, too,” retorted George. 
“We'll all swing and sun-dry for your 
bungling.” 
“Well, now, look here, I'll answer 
these four p’ints; one after another 9

duff, and the treasure in the hold of 
her, by thunder! Well, who crossed 
me? Who forced my hand, as was 
the lawful cap’n? Who tipped me 
the black spot the day we landed, 
and began this dance? Ah, it’s a 
fine dance—I’m with you there—and 
looks mighty like a hornpipe in a 
rope’s end at Execution Dock by 
London town, it does. But who done 
it? Why, it was Anderson, and 
Hands, and you, George Merry! And 
you're the last above board of that 
. same meddling crew; and you have 
2 
s 
40 the Davy Jones’s insolence to up and 
stand for cap’n over me—you, that 
sank the lot of us! By the powers! 
but this tops the stiffest yarn to 
nothing.” 
Silver paused, and I could see by 
the faces of George and his late com- 
rades that these words had not been 
said in vain. 
“That’s for number one,”’ cried the 
accused, wiping the sweat from his 
brow, for he had been talking with a 
vehemence that shook the house. 
“Why, I give you my word, I’m sick 
to speak to you. You've neither 
sense nor memory, and I leave it to 
fancy where your mothers was that 
let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen 
o’ fortune! I reckon tailors is your 
trade.” 
“Go on, John,” said Morgan. 
“Speak up to the others.” 
“Ah, the others!” returned John. 
“They’re a nice lot, ain’t they? 
You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! 
by gum, if you could understand how 
bad it’s bungled, you would see! 
We're that near the gibbet that my 
neck’s stiff with thinking .on it. 
You’ve seen ’em, maybe, hanged in 
chains, birds about ’em, seamen p’int- 
ing ’em out as they go down with the 
tide. ‘Who's that?’ says one. “That? 
Why, that’s John Silver. I knowed 
him well,’ says another. And you can 179 
hear .the chains a-jangle as you go 
about and reach for the other buoy. 
Now, that’s about where we are, 
every mother’s son of us, thanks to 
him, and Hands, and Anderson, and 
other ruination fools of you. And 
if you want to know about number 
four, and that boy, why, shiver my 
timbers! isn’t he a hostage? Are we 
a-going to waste a hostage? No, not 
us; he might be our last chance, and 
I shouldn’t wonder. Kill that boy? 
Not me, mates! And number three? 
Ah, well, there’s a deal to say to 
number three. Maybe you don’t 
count it nothing to have a, real college 
doctor come to see you every day— 
you, John, with your head broke— 
or you, George Merry, that had the 
ague shakes upon you not six hours 
agone, and has your eyes the color of 
lemon peel to this same moment on 
the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you 
didn’t know there was a consort com- 
ing, either? But there is; and not so 
long till then; and we'll see who'll 
be glad to have a hostage when it 
comes to that. And as for number 
two, and why I made a bargain—well, 
you came crawling on your knees to 
me to make it—on your knees you 
came, you was that downhearted— 
and you'd have starved, too, if T 
hadn’t—but that’s a trifle! you look 
there—that’s why!” 
And he cast down upon the floor a 
paper that I instantly recognized— 
none other than the chart on yellow 
paper, with the three red crosses, that 
I had found in the oilcloth at the 
bottom of the captain’s chest. Why 
the doctor had given it to him was 
more than I could fancy. 
But if it were inexplicable to me, 
the appearance of the chart was in- 
credible to the surviving mutineers. 
They leaped upon it like cats upon a 
mouse. Jt went from hand to hand, 
one tearing it from another; and by 50

the oaths and the cries and the childish 
laughter ‘with which they accom- 
panied their examination, you would 
have thought, not only they were 
fingering the very gold, but were at 
sea, with it, besides, in safety. 
“Yes,” said one, “that’s Flint sure 
enough. J. F., and a score below, with 
a clove-hitch to it; so he done ever.” 
“Mighty pretty,” said George. “But 
how are we to get away with it, and 
us no ship?” 
Silver suddenly sprang up, and 
supporting himself with a hand against 
the wall: “Now I give you warning, 
“One more word 
of your sauce, and I'll call you down 
and fight you. How? Why, do I 
know? You had ought to tell me 
that—you and the rest, that lost me 
my schooner, with your interference, 
burn you! But not you, you can’t; 
you hain’t got the invention of. a 
cockroach. But civil you can speak, 
and shall, George Merry, you may 
lay to that.” 
“That’s fair enow,” said the old 
man Morgan. 
“Fair! IT reckon so,” said the sea 
cook. “You lost the ship; I found 
the treasure. Who's the better man 
at that? And now I resign, by thun- 
der! Elect whom you please to be 
your cap’n; I’m done with it.” 
“Silver!” they cried. “Barbecue 
for ever! Barbecue for cap’n!” . 
“So that’s the toon, is it?’’ cried the 
cook. “George, I reckon you’ll have 
to wait another turn, friend; and 
lucky for you as I’m not a revengeful 
man. But that was,never my way. 
And now, shipmates, this black spot? 
*Tain’t much good now, is it? Dick’s 
crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, 
and that’s about all.” 
“Tt’ll do to kiss the book on still, 
won't it?” growled Dick, who was 
evidently uneasy at the curse he had 
brought upon himself. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“A Bible with a bit cut out!” 1 
turned Silver, derisively. “Not ; 
It don’t bind no more’n a balla 
book.” 
“Don’t it, though?” cried Dick, 
with a sort of joy. “Well, I reckon 
that’s worth having, too.” 
“Here, Jim—here’s a cur’osity for 
you,” said Silver; and he tossed me 
the paper. : 
It was a round about the size of a 
crown piece. One side was blank, 
for it had been the last leaf; the 
other contained a verse or two of 
Revelation—these words among the 
rest, which struck sharply home upon 
my mind: “Without are dogs and 
murderers.” The printed side had 
been blackened with wood ash, which 
already began to come off and svil 
my fingers; on the blank side had 
been written with the same material 
the one word ‘“Depposed.” I have 
that curiosity beside me at this mo- 
ment; but not a trace of writing now 
remains beyond a single scratch, such 
as a man might make with his thumb- 
nail. 
That was the end of the night’s 
business. Soon after, with a drink 
all round, we lay down to sleep, and 
the outside of Silver’s vengeance was 
to put George Merry up for sentinel, 
and threaten him with death if he 
should prove unfaithful. 
It was long ere I could close an eye, 
and Heaven knows I had matter 
enough for thought in the man whom 
T had slain that afternoon, in my own 
most perilous position, and, above all, 
in the remarkable game that I saw 
Silver now engaged upon—keeping 
the mutineers together with one hand, 
and grasping, with the other, after 
every means, possible and impossible, 
to make his peace and save his mis- 
erable life. He himself slept peace- 
fully, and snored aloud; yet my heart 
was-sore for him, wicked as he was, 
a 
«e
-P-A-G-E-190
10 TREASURE ISLAND 
to think on the dark perils that en- 
vironed, and the shameful gibbet that 
awaited him. 
CHAPTER XXX 
On ParoLe 
I was wakened—indeed, we were 
all wakened, for I could see even the 
sentinel shake himself together from 
where he had fallen against the door- 
post—by a clear, hearty voice hailing 
us from the margin of the wood: 
“Block-house, ahoy!’ it cried. 
“Here’s the doctor.” 
And the doctor it was. Although 
I was glad to hear the sound, yet 
my gladness was not without ad- 
mixture. I remembered with con- 
fusion my insubordinate and stealthy 
conduct; and when J saw where it had 
brought me—among what companions 
and surrounded by what dangers—I 
felt ashamed to look him in the face. 
He must have risen in the dark, for 
the day had hardly come; and when 
I ran to a loophole and looked out, 
I saw him standing, like Silver once 
before, up to the midleg in creeping 
vapor. 
“You, doctor! Top o’ the morning 
to you, sir!” cried Silver, broad awake 
and beaming with good-nature in a 
moment. “Bright and early, to be 
sure; and it’s the early bird, as the 
saying goes, that: gets the rations. 
George, shake up your timbers, son, 
and help Dr. Livesey over the ship’s 
side. All a-doin’ well, your patients 
was—all well and merry.” 
So he pattered on, standing on the 
hilltop, with his crutch under his 
elbow, and one hand. upon the side 
of the log-house—quite the old John, 
in voice, manner, and expression. 
“We've quite a surprise for you, too, 
sir,” he continued. “We've a little 
stranger here—he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, si: 
taut as a fidd|

though he did 
some seconds 
to move on. 
“Well, well,” 
first and pleasure or... eeey we yen 
might have said yourself, Silver. Let 
us overhaul these patients of yours.” 
A moment afterwards he had en- 
tered the block-house, and with one 
grim nod to me, proceeded with his 
work among the sick. He seemed 
under no apprehension, though he 
must have known that his life, among 
these treacherous demons, depended 
on a hair; and he rattled on to his 
patients as if he were paying an ordi- 
nary professional visit in a quiet Eng- 
lish family. His manner, I suppose, 
reacted on the men; for they behaved 
to him as if nothing had occurred— 
as if he was still ship’s doctor, and 
they still faithful hands before the 
mast. 
“You're doing well, my friend,” he 
said to the fellow with the bandaged 
head, “and if ever any person had a 
close shave, it was you; your head 
must be as hard asiron. Well, George, 
how goes it? You're a pretty color, 
certainly; why, your liver, man, 
is upside down. Did you take that 
medicine? Did he take that medicine, 
men?” : 
“Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure 
enough,” returned Morgan. 
“Because, you see, since I am mu- 
tineers’ doctor, or prison doctor, as I 
  90 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
182 
prefer to call it,” says Dr. Livesey, in 
his pleasantest way, “I make it a 
point of honor not to lose a man for 
King George (God bless him!) and the 
gallows.” 
The rogues looked at each other, 
but swallowed the home-thrust in 
silence. 
‘Dick don’t feel well, sir,” said one. 
10 - “Don’t he?’ replied ‘the doctor. 
“Well, step up here, Dick, and let me 
see your tongue. No, I should be 
surprised if he did! The man’s tongue 
is fit to frighten the French. Another 
fever.” 
“Ah, there,” said Morgan, 
comed of sp’iling Bibles.” 
“That comed—as you call it—of 
being arrant asses,” retorted the 
20 doctor, “and not having sense enough 
to know honest air from poison, and 
the dry land from a vile, pestiferous 
slough. I think it most probable 
though, of course, it’s only an opinion 
—that you'll all have the deuce to pay 
before you get that malaria out of 
your systems. Camp in a bog, would 
you? Silver, I’m surprised at you. 
You’re less of a fool than many, take 
30 you all around; but you don’t appear 
to me to have the rudiments of a 
notion of the rules of health.” 
“Well,” he added, after he had 
dosed them round, and they had taken 
his prescriptions, with really laughable 
humility, more like charity school chil- 
dren than blood-guilty mutineers and 
pirates—‘‘well, that’s done for today. 
-And now I should wish to have a talk 
49 with that boy, please.” And he nodded 
his head in my direction carelessly. 
George Merry was at the door, 
spitting and spluttering over some 
bad-tasting medicine; but at the first 
word of the doctor’s proposal he 
swung round with a deep flush, and 
cried “No!” and swore. Silver struck 
the barrel with his open hand. 
“Si-lence!’’ he roared, and looked “that THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
about him positively like a lion. 
“Doctor,” he went on, in his usual 
tones, “I was a-thinking of that, 
knowing as how you had a fancy for 
the boy. We’re all humbly grateful 
for your kindness, and, as you see, 
puts faith in you, and takes the drugs 
down like that much grog. And I 
take it, I’ve found a way as’ll suit all. 
Hawkins, will you give me your word 
of honor as a young gentleman—for 60 
a young gentleman you are, although 
poor born—your word of honor not: 
to slip your cable?” 
I readily gave the pledge required. 
“Then, doctor,” said Silver, “you 
just step outside o’ that stockade, and 
once you’re there, I'll bring the boy 
down on the inside, and I reckon you 
can yarn through the spars. Good- 
day to you, sir, and all our dooties to 70 
the squire and Cap’n Smollett.” 
The explosion of disapproval, which 
nothing but Silver’s black looks had 
restrained, broke out immediately 
the doctor had left the house. Silver 
was roundly accused of playing double 
—of trying to make a separate peace 
for himself—of sacrificing the interests 
of his accomplices and victims; and, 
in one word, of the identical, exact 30 
thing that he was doing. It seemed 
to me so obvious, in this case, that I 
could not imagine how he was to turn 
their anger. But he was twice the 
man the rest were; and his last night’s 
victory had given him a huge pre- 
ponderance on their minds. He called 
them all the fools and dolts you can 
imagine, said it was necessary I should 
talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart 9 
in their faces, asked them if they could 
afford to break the treaty the very 
day they were bound a- treasure-

“No, by thunder!” he cried, “‘it’s us

comes; and till then I'll gammon that

doctor, if I have to ile his boots with 
brandy.” 
And then he bade them get the fire 
lit, and stalked out upon his crutch, 
with his hand on my shoulder, leaving 
them in a disarray, and silenced by 
his volubility rather than convinced. 
“Slow, lad, slow,” he said. ‘They 
might round upon us in a twinkle of 
an eye, if we was seen, to hurry.” 
Very deliberately, then, did we 
advance across the sand to where the 
doctor awaited us on the other side of 
the stockade, and as soon as we were 
within easy speaking distance, Silver 
stopped. 
“You'll make a note of this here 
also, doctor,” says he, “and the boy’ll 
tell you how I saved his life, and were 
deposed for it, too, and you may lay 
to that. Doctor, when a man’s steer- 
ing as near the wind as me—playing 
chuck-farthing with the last breath in 
his body, like—you wouldn’t think it 
too much, mayhap, to give him one 
good word? You'll please bear in 
mind it’s not my life only now—it’s 
that boy’s into the bargain; and you'll 
speak me fair, doctor, and give me a 
bit 0” hope to go on, for the sake of 
mercy.” 
Silver was a changed man, once he 
was out there and had his back to 
his friends and the block-house; his 
cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his 
voice trembled; never was a soul 
more dead in earnest. 
“Why, John, you’re not afraid?” 
asked Dr. Livesey. 
“Doctor, I’m no coward; no, not I 
—not so much!” and he snapped his 
fingers. “If I was I wouldn’t say it. 
But I'll own up fairly, I’ve the shakes 
upon me for the gallows. You're a 
good man and a true; I neyer seen a 
better man! And you'll not forget 
what I done good, not any more than 
you'll forget the bad, I know. . And I 
step aside—see here—and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that 
down for me, too, for it’s a long 
stretch, is that!” 
So saying, he stepped back a little 
way, till he was out of earshot, and 
there sat down upon a tree-stump and 
began to whistle; spinning round now 
and again upon his seat so as to com- 
mand a sight, sometimes of me and 
the doctor, and sometimes of his 
unruly ruffians as they went to and 
fro in the sand, between the fire— 
which they were busy rekindling— 
and the house, from which they 
brought forth pork and bread to make 
_ the breakfast. 
“So, Jim,” said the doctor sadly, 
“here you are. As you have brewed, 
so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven 
knows, I cannot find it in my heart to 
blame you; but this much I will say, 
be it kind or unkind: when Captain 
Smollett was well, you dared not have 
gone off; and when he was ill, and 
couldn’t help it, by George, it was 
downright cowardly!” 
I will own that I here began to weep. 
“Doctor,” I said, “you might spare 
me. I have blamed myself enough; 
ny life’s forfeit anyway, and I should 
have been dead by now, if Silver 
hadn’t stood for me; and, doctor, be- 
lieve this, I can die—and I daresay I 
deserve it—but what I fear is torture. 
If they come to torture me—” 
“Jim,” the doctor interrupted, and 
his voice was quite changed, “Jim, 
I can’t have this. Whip over, and 
we'll run for it.” 
“Doctor,” said I, “I passed my 
word.” 
“I know, I know,” he cried. “We 
can’t help that, Jim, now. I'll take 
it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame 
and shame, my boy; but stay here, 
I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, 
and you’re out, and we'll run for it 
like antelopes.” . 
“No,” I replied, “you know right 183 -

30 well you wouldn’t do the thing your- 
self; neither you, nor squire, nor 
captain; and no more will I. Silver 
trusted me; I passed my word, and 
back I go. But, doctor, you did not 
let me finish. If they come to torture 
-me, I might let slip a word of where 
the ship is; for I got the ship, part by 
luck and part by risking, and she lies 
in North Inlet, on the southern beach, 
and just below high water. At half 
tide she must be high and dry.” 
“The ship!’ exclaimed the doctor. 
Rapidly I described to him my ad- 
ventures, and he heard me out in 
silence. 
“There is a kind of fate in this,” 
he observed, when I had done. “Every | 
step, it’s you that saves our lives; 
and do you suppose by any chance 
that we are going to let you lose 
yours? That would be a poor re- 
turn, my boy. You found out the 
plot; you found Ben Gunn—the best 
deed that ever you did, or will do, 
though you live to ninety. Oh, by 
Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! 
why, this is the mischief in person. 
Silver!” he cried, “Silver!—I’ll give 
you a piece of advice,”’ he continued, 
as the cook drew near again; “‘don’t 
you be in any great hurry after that 
treasure.” 
“Why, sir, I do my possible, which 
that ain’t,” said Silver. “I can only, 
asking your pardon, save my life and 
the boy’s by seeking for that treasure; 
and you may lay to that.” 
“Well, Silver,’”’ replied the doctor, 
“Sf that is so, Pll go one step further: 
look out for squalls when you find it.” 
“Sir,” said Silver, ‘as between man 
and man, that’s too much and too 
little. What you’re after, why you 
left the block-house, why you given 
me that there chart, I don’t know, 
now, do I? and yet I done your bid- 
ding. with my eyes shut and never a 
word of hope! But no, this here’s THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
too much. If you won’t tell me what 
you mean plain out, just say so, and 
I'll leave the helm.” 
“No,” said the doctor, musingly, 
“I’ve no right to say more; it’s not 
my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give 
you my word, I’d tell it you. But 
I'll go as far with you as I dare go, 
and a step beyond; for I’ll have my 
wig sorted by the captain or I’m 
mistaken! And, first, Tl give you o 
a bit of hope: Silver, if we both 
get alive out of this wolf-trap, Dil 
do my best to save you, short of per- 
jury.” 
Silver’s face was radiant. “You 
couldn’t say more, I’m sure, sir, not 
if you was my mother,” he cried. 
“Well, that’s my first concession,” 
added the doctor. ‘My second is a 
piece of advice: Keep the boy close 
beside you, and when you need help, 
halloo. I’m off to seek it for you, 
and that itself will show you if I 
speak at random. Good-by, Jim.” 
And Dr. Livesey shook hands with 
me through the stockade, nodded to 
Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into 
the wood. :

“Jim,” said Silver, when we were 
alone, “if I saved your life, you saved 
mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen 
the doctor waving you to run for it— 
with the tail of my eye, I did; and I 
seen you say no, as plain as hearing. 
Jim, that’s one to you. This is the 
first glint of hope I had since the 
attack failed, and I owe it you. And

fire that breakfast was ready, and 
we were soon seated here and there 
about the sand over biscuit and fried 
junk. They had lit a fire.fit to roast 
an ox; and it was now grown so hot 
10 that they could only approach it from 
the windward, and even there not 
without precaution. In the same 
wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I 
suppose, three times more than we 
could eat; and one of them, with an 
empty laugh, threw what was left into 
the fire, which blazed and roared 
again over this unusual fuel. I never 
in my life saw men so careless of the 
2 morrow; hand to mouth is the only 
word that can describe their way of 
doing; and what with wasted food 
and sleeping sentries, though they 
were bold enough for a brush and be 
done with it, I could see their entire 
unfitness for anything like a prolonged 
campaign. 
Even Silver, eating away, with Cap- 
tain Flint upon his shoulder, had not 
a word of blame for their recklessness. 
And this the more surprised me, for I 
thought he had never shown himself 
so cunning as he did then. 
“Aye, mates,” said he, “it’s lucky 
you have Barbecue to think for you 
with this here head. I got what I 
wanted, I did. Sure enough, they 
have the ship. Where they have it, I 
don’t know yet; -but once we hit the 
treasure, we'll have to jump about 
and find out. And then, mates, us 
that has the boats, I reckon, has the 
upper hand.” 
Thus he kept running on, with his 
mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he 
restored their hope and confidence, 
and, I more than suspect, repaired his 
own at the same time. 
“As for hostage,” he continued, oe Ss & me must stick close, back to back like, 
and we'll save our necks in spite 0’ 
fate and fortune.” 
Just then a man hailed us from the 185 
“that’s his last talk, I guess, with 
them he loves so dear. I’ve got my 
piece o’ news, and thanky to him for 
that; but it’s over and done. I'll 
take him in a line when we go treasure- 
hunting, for we'll keep him like so 
much gold, in case of accidents, you 
mark, and in the meantime, once we 
got the ship and treasure both, and 
off to sea like jolly companions, why, 
then, we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we 
will, and we'll give him his share, to be 
sure, for all his kindness.” 
It was no wonder the men were in 
a good humor now. For my part, 
I was horribly cast down. Should the. 
scheme he had now sketched prove 
feasible, Silver, already doubly a 
traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. 
He had still a foot in either camp, 
and there was no doubt he would 
prefer wealth and freedom with the 
pirates to a bare escape from hanging, 
which was the best he had to hope on 
our side. 
Nay, and even if things so fell out 
that he was forced to keep his faith 
with Dr. Livesey, even then what 
danger lay before us! What a mo- 
ment that would be when the suspi- 
cions of his followers turned to cer- 
tainty, and he and I should have to 
fight for dear life—he, a cripple, and 
I, a boy—against five strong and 
active seamen! 
Add to this double apprehension, 
the mystery that still hung over the 
behavior of my friends, their unex- 
plained desertion of the stockade; 
their inexplicable cession of the chart; 
or, harder still to understand, the 
doctor’s last warning to Silver, “Look 
out for squalls when you find it”; 
and you will readily believe how little 
taste I found in my breakfast, and 
with how uneasy a heart I set forth 
‘behind my captors on the quest for 
treasure. 
We made a curious figure, had 
 
-P-A-G-E-195

anyone been there to see us; all in 
soiled sailor clothes, and all but me 
armed to the teeth. Silver had two 
guns slung about him—one before and 
one behind—besides the great cutlass 
at his waist, and a pistol in each 
pocket of his square-tailed coat. To 
complete his strange appearance, Cap- 
tain Flint sat perched upon his shoul- 
der and gabbling odds and ends of 
purposeless sea-talk. I had a line 
about my waist, and followed obedi- 
ently after the sea cook, who held the 
loose end of the rope, now in his free . 
hand, now between his powerful teeth. 
For all the world, I was led like a 
dancing bear. 
The other men were variously 
burdened; some carrying picks and 
shovéls—for that had been the very 
first necessary they brought ashore 
from the Hispaniola—others laden 
with pork, bread, and brandy for the 
midday meal. All the stores, I ob- 
served, came from our stock; and I 
could see the truth of Silver’s words 
the night before. Had he not struck 
a bargain with the doctor, he and his 
mutineers, deserted by the ship, must 
have been driven to subsist on clear 
water and the proceeds of their hunt- 
ing. Water would have been little 
to their taste; a sailor is not usually 
a good shot; and, besides all that, 
when they were so short of eatables, 
it was not likely they would be very 
flush of powder. 
Well, thus equipped, we all set out— 
even the fellow with the broken head, 
who should certainly have kept in 
shadow—and straggled one after an- 
other, to the beach, where the two 
gigs awaited us. Even these bore 
trace of the, drunken folly of the 
* pirates, one in a broken thwart, and 
both in their. muddied and unbaled 
condition. Both were to be carried 
along with us for the sake of safety; 
and so, with: our numbers divided THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
between them, we set forth upon the 
bosom of the anchorage. 
As we pulled over, there was some 
discussion on the chart. The red 
cross was, of course, far too large to 
be a guide; and the terms of the note 
on the back, as you will hear, admit- 
ted of someambiguity. They ran, the 
reader may remember, thus:

to steepen and become stony under 
foot, and the wood to change its 
character and to grow in a more open 
order. It was, indeed, a most pleasant 
portion of the island that we were now 
approaching. A heavy-scented broom 
and many flowering shrubs had almost 
taken the place of grass. Thickets of 
green nutmeg trees were dotted here 
and there with the red columns and 
the broad shadow of the pines; and 
the first mingled their spice with the 
aroma of the others. The air, be- 
sides, was fresh and stirring, and this, 
under the sheer sunbeams, was. a 
wonderful refreshment to our senses. 
The party spread itself abroad, in 
a fan shape, shouting and leaping 
to and fro. About the center, and a 
good way behind the rest, Silver and 
I followed—I tethered by my rope, 
he plowing, with deep pants, among 
the sliding gravel. From time to 
time, indeed, I had to lend him a 
hand, or he must have missed his 
footing and fallen backward down the 
hill. 
We had thus proceeded for about 
half a mile, and were approaching the 
brow of the plateau, when the man 
upon the farthest left began to cry 
aloud, as if in terror. Shout after 
shout came from him, and the others 
began to run in his direction. 
“He can’t ’a’ found the treasure,” 
said old Morgan, hurrying past us 
from the right, “for that’s clean 
a-top.” 
Indeed, as we found when we also 
reached ‘the spot, it was something 
_ very different. At the foot of a pretty 
big pine, and involved in a green 
creeper, which had even partly lifted 
some of the smaller bones, a human 
skeleton lay, with a few shreds of cloth- 
ing, on the ground. I believe a chill 
struck for a moment to every heart. 
“He was a seaman,” said George 
Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
gone up close, and was examinin; 
rags of clothing. “Leastways, tL. .. 
good sea-cloth.” 
“Aye, aye,” said Silver, 
enough; you wouldn’t look t 
a bishop here, I reckon. But 
sort of a way is that for bones -_ —.. 
“‘Tain’t in natur’.” 
Indeed, on a_ second

o’ Skeleton Island, stickin’ out like a 
tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, 
along the line of them bones.” 
It was done. The body pointed 
straight in the direction of the island, 
and the compass read duly E.S.E. and 
by E. 
“JT thought so,” cried the cook; “‘this 
here is a p’inter. Right up there is 
our line for the Pole Star and the jolly 
dollars. But, by thunder! if it don’t 
make me cold inside to think of Flint. 
This is one of his jokes, and no mis- 
take. Him and these six was alone 
here; he killed ’em, every man; and 
this one he hauled here and laid duwn 
by compass, shiver my timbers! 
They’re long bones, and the hair’s 
been yellow. Aye, that would be 
Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom 
Morgan?” 
“Aye, aye,” returned Morgan, “I 
mind him; he owed me money, he 
did, and took my knife ashore with 
him.” 
“Speaking of knives,” said another, 
“why don’t we find his’n lying round?

a, man’s pocket; and the birds, I guess, 
would leave it be.” 
“By the powers, and that’s true!” 
cried Silver. 
“There ain’t a thing left here,” said 
Merry, still feeling round among the 
bones, “not a copper doit nor a baccy 
box. It don’t look nat’ral to me.” 
“No, by gum, it don’t,” agreed 
Silver; “not nat’ral, nor not nice, says 
you. Great guns! messmates, but if 
Flint was living, this would be a hot 
spot for you and me. Six they were, 
and six are we; and bones is what they 
are now.” 
“I saw him dead with these here 
deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took 
mein, There he Jaid, with penny- 
pieces on his eyes.’ 
“Dead—aye, sure enough he’ 's dead 
and gone below,”’ said the fellow with 
the bandage; “but if ever sperrit 
walked, it would be Flint’s. Dear 
heart, but he died bad, did Flint!” 
“Aye, that he did,’ observed an- 
other; “now he raged, and now he 
hollered for the ram, and now he sang. 
‘Fifteen Men’ were his only song, 
mates; and I tell you true, I never 
tightly liked to hear it since. It was 
main hot, and the windy was open, 
and I hear that old song comin’ out 
as clear as clear—and the death-haul 
on the man already.” 
“Come, come,” said Silver, “stow 
this talk. He’s dead, and he don’t 
walk, that I knows; leastways, he 
won’t walk by day, and you may lay 
to that. Care killed a cat. Fetch 
ahead for the doubloons.”’ 
We started, certainly; but in spite 
of the hot, sun and the staring day- 
light, the pirates no longer ran sep- 
arate and shouting through the wood, 
but kept side by side and spoke with 
bated breath. The terror of the dead 
buccaneer had fallen on their spirits,

CHAPTER XXXII 
Tue Treasvre-Hunt—Tue Voice 
" Amone THE TREES . 
Partly from the damping influence 
of this alarm, partly to rest Silver 
and the sick folk, the whole party 
sat down as soon as they had gained 
the brow of the ascent. 
The plateau being somewhat tilted 
toward the west, this spot on which 
we had paused commanded a wide 
prospect on either hand. Before us, 
over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape 
of the Woods fringed with surf; be- 
hind, we not only looked down upon 
the anchorage and Skeleton Island, 
but saw—clear across the spit and the 
eastern lowlands—a great field of open 
sea upon the east. Sheer above us 
rose the Spyglass, here dotted with 
single pines, there black with preci- 
pices. There was no sound but that 
of the distant breakers, mounting 
from all round, and the chirp of 
countless insects in the brush. Not 
a man, not a sail upon the sea; the 
very largeness of the view increased 
the sense of solitude. 
*Silver, as he sat, took certain bear- 
ings with his compass. 
“There are three ‘tall trees,’ ”’ said 
he, “about in the right line from 
Skeleton Island. ‘Spyglass Shoulder,’ 
I take it, means that lower p’int 
there. It’s child’s play to find the 
stuff now. I’ve half a mind to dine 
first.” . 
“T don’t feel sharp,” growled Mor- 
gan. “Thinking o’ Flint—I think it 
were—as done me.” 
“Ah, well, my son, you praise your 
stars he’s dead,” said Silver. 
“He were an ugly devil,”

blue in the face, too!” 
“That was how the rum took him,’

Ever since they had found the 
skeleton and got upon this train of 
thought, they had spoken lower and 
lower, and they had almost got to 
whispering by now, so that the sound 
of their talk hardly interrupted the 
silence of the wood. All of a sudden, © 
out of the middle of the trees in front 
of us, a thin, high, trembling voice 
struck up the well-known air and 
words: 
Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest— 
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
I never have seen men more dread- 
fully affected than the pirates. The 
color went from their six faces like 
enchantment; some leaped to their 
feet, some clawed hold of others; 
Morgan groveled on the ground. 
“Tt’s Flint, by Y? cried Merry. 
The song had stopped as suddenly 
as it began—broken off, you would 
have said, in the middle of a note, as 
though someone had laid his hand 
upon the singer’s mouth. Coming so 
far through the clear, sunny atmos- 
phere among the green tree-tops, I 
thought it had sounded airily and 
sweetly; and the effect on my com- 
panions was the stranger. 
“Come,” said Silver, struggling with 
his ashen lips to get: the word out; 
“this won’t do. Stand by to go about. 
This is a rum start, and I can’t name 
the voice; but it’s someone sky- 
larking—someone that’s . flesh and   
blood, and you may lay. to that.” 
His courage had come back as he 
spoke, and some of the color to his 
face along with it. Already the others 
had begun to lend an ear to this en- 
couragement, and were coming a little 
to themselves, when the same voice 
broke out again—not this time singing, 
but in a faint distant hail, that echoed 
yet fainter among the clefts of the 
Spyglass. 
“Darby M’Graw,” it wailed—for 
that is the word that best describes THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
the sound—‘‘Darby M’Graw! 
M’Graw!” again and again an 
and then rising a little higher, a 
an oath that I leave out, “Fu. 
the rum, Darby!”

their heads. Long after the

And the rest were all too terrified to 
reply. They would have run away 
severally had: they dared; but fear 
kept them together, and kept them 
close by John, as if his daring helped 
them. He, on his part, had pretty 
well fought his weakness down. 
“Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. 
“But there’s’ one thing not clear to
-P-A-G-E-200
TREASURE ISLAND 
me. There was an echo. Now, no 
man ever seen a, sperrit with a shadow; 
well, then, what’s he doing with an 
echo to him, I should like to know? 
That ain’t in natur’, surely?” 
This argument seemed weak enough 
to me. But you can never tell what 
will affect the superstitious, and, to 
my wonder, George Merry was greatly 
relieved. . 
“Well, that’s so,” he said. ‘“You’ve 
a head upon your shoulders, John, and 
no mistake. ’Bout ship, mates! This 
here crew is on a wrong tack, I do 
believe. And come to think on it, it 
was like Flint’s voice, I grant you, but 
not just so clear-away like it, after all. 
It was liker somebody else’s voice, 
now—it was liker—” 
“By the powers, Ben Gunn 
Silver. 
“Aye, and so it were,” cried Mor- 
gan, springing on his knees. “Ben 
Gunn it were!’’ 
“Tt don’t make much odds, do it, 
now?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn’s not 
here in the body, any more’n Flint.” 
But the older: hands greeted this 
remark with scorn. 
“Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” 
eried Merry; ‘dead or alive, nobody 
minds him.” 
It was extraordinary how their 
spirits had returned, and how the 
natural color had revived in their 
faces. Soon they were, chatting to- 
gether, with intervals of listening; 
and not long after, hearing no further 
sound, they shouldered the tools and 
set forth again, Merry walking first 
with Silver’s compass to keep them on 
the right line with Skeleton Island. 
He had said the truth; dead or alive, 
nobody minded Ben Gunn. 
Dick alone still held his Bible, and 
looked around him as he went, with 
fearful glances; but he found no sym- 
pathy, and Silver even joked him on 
his precautions. roared 191 
“T told you,” said he—“I told you, 
you had sp’iled your Bible. If it 
ain’t no good to swear by, what do 
you suppose a sperrit would give for 
it? Not that!’ and he snapped his 
big fingers, halting a moment on his 
crutch. 
But Dick was not to be comforted; 
indeed, it was soon plain.to me that 
the lad was falling sick; hastened by 
heat, exhaustion, and the shock of his 
alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr. 
Livesey, was evidently growing swiftly 
higher. 
It was fine open walking here, upon 
the summit; our way lay a little down- 
hill, for, as I have said, the plateau 
tilted toward the west. The pines, 
great and small, grew wide apart; 
and even between the clumps of nut- 
meg and azalea, wide open spaces 
baked in the hot sunshine. Striking, 
as we did, pretty near northwest 
across the island, we drew, on the one 
hand, ever nearer under the shoulders 
of the Spyglass, and on the other, 
looked ever wider over that western 
bay where I had once tossed and 
trembled in the coracle. . 
The first of the tall trees was 
reached, and by the bearing proved 
the wrong one. So with the second. 
The third rose nearly two hundred 
feet into the air above a clump of 
underwood; a giant of a vegetable, 
with a red column as big as a cottage, 
and a wide shadow around jin which 
a company could have maneuvered. 
It was conspicuous far to sea both 
on the east and west, and might have 
been entered as a sailing mark upon 
the chart. 
But it was not its size that now 
impressed my companions; it was 
the knowledge that seven hundred 
thousand pounds in gold lay some- 
where buried below its spreading 
shadow. The thought of the money, 
as.they drew nearer, swallowed up 56
-P-A-G-E-201
192 
their previous terrors. Their eyes 
burned in their heads; their feet grew 
speedier and lighter; their whole soul 
was bound up in that fortune, that 
whole lifetime of extravagance and 
pleasure, that lay waiting there for 
each of them. 
Silver hobbled, grunting, on his 
crutch; his nostrils stood out and 
10 quivered; he cursed like a madman 
when the flies settled on his hot and 
shiny countenance; he plucked furi- 
ously at the line that held me to him, 
and, from time to time, turned his 
eyes upon me with a deadly look. 
Certainly he took no pains to hide 
his thoughts; and certainly I read 
them like print. In the immediate 
nearness of the gold, all else had been 
20 forgotten; his promise and the doctor’s 
warning were both things of the past; 
and I could not doubt that he hoped 
to seize upon the treasure, find and 
board the Hispaniola under cover of 
night, cut every honest throat about 
that island and sail away as he had 
at first intended, laden with crimes 
and riches. 
Shaken as I was with these alarms, 
30 it was hard for me to keep up with 
the rapid pace of the-treasure-hunters. 
Now and again I stumbled; and it was 
then that Silver plucked so roughly 
at the rope and launched at me his 
murderous glances. Dick, who had 
dropped behind us, and now brought 
up the rear, was babbling to himself 
both prayers and curses, as his fever 
kept rising. This also added to my 
40 wretchedness, and, to crown all, I 
was haunted by the thought of the 
tragedy that had once been acted on 
that plateau, when that ungodly 
buccaneer with the blue face—he who 
died at Savannah, singing and shout- 
ing for drink—had there, with his own 
hand, cut down his six accomplices. 
This grove, that was now so peaceful, . 
must then have rung with cries, J THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
thought; and even with the thought I 
could believe I heard it ringing still. 
We were now at the margin of the 
thicket. 
“Huzza, mates, all together!” 
shouted ‘Merry; and the foremost 
broke into a run. - 
And suddenly, not ten yards farther, 
we beheld them stop. A low cry 
arose. Silver doubled his pace, dig- 
ging away with the foot of his crutch 
like one possessed; and next moment 
he and I had come also to a dead halt. 
Before us was a great excavation, 
not very recent, for the sides had 
fallen in and grass had sprouted on 
the bottom. In this were the shaft 
‘of a pick broken in two and the 
_ boards of several packing-cases strewn 
around. On one of these boards I 
saw, branded with a hot iron, the 
name Walrus—the name of Flint’s 
ship. . 
All was clear to probation. The 
cache had been found and rifled: the 
seven hundred thousand pounds were 
gone! 
CHAPTER XXXIII 
Tae Fauu or a CHIErrain 
There never was such an overturn 
in this world. Each of these six men 
was as though he had been struck. 
But with Silver the blow passed almost 
instantly. Every thought of his soul 
had been set full-stretch, like a racer, 
on that money; well, he was brought 
up in a single second, dead; and he 
kept his head, found his temper, and 
changed his plan before the others 
had had time to realize the disap- 
pointment. 
“Jim,” he whispered, “take that, 
and stand by for trouble.” * a 
And he passed me a double-barreled 
pistol. 
At the same time he began quietly
-P-A-G-E-202
A 
3 TREASURE ISLAND 
moving northward, and in a few steps 
had put the hollow between us two 
and the other five. Then he looked 
at me and nodded, as much as to 
say, “Here is a narrow corner,” as, 
indeed, I thought it was. His looks 
were now quite friendly; and I was 
so revolted at these constant changes, 
that I could,not forbear whispering, 
“So you’ve changed sides again.’ 
There was no time left for him to 
answer in. The buccaneers, with 
oaths and cries, began to leap, one 
after another, into the pit, and to dig 
with their fingers, throwing the boards 
aside as they did so. Morgan found 
a piece of gold. He held it up with a 
perfect spout of oaths. It was a two- 
guinea piece, and it went from hand 
to hand among them for a quarter 
of a minute. 
“Two guineas,”’ roared Merry, shak- 
ing it at Silver. “That’s your seven 
hundred thousand pounds, is it? 
You’re the man for bargains, ain’t you? 
You’re him that never bungled 
nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!” 
“Dig away, boys,” said Silver, with 
the coolest insolence; “‘you’ll find some 
pig-nuts, and I shouldn’t wonder.” 
“Pig-nuts!”’ repeated Merry, in a 
scream. “Mates, do you hear that? 
I tell you, now, that man there knew 
it all along. Look in the face of 
him, and you'll see it wrote there.” 
“Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, 
“standing for cap’n again? You're 
a pushing lad, to be sure.” 
But this time everyone was en- 
tirely in Merry’s favor. They began 
to scramble out of the excavation, 
darting furious glances behind them. 
One thing I observed, which looked 
well for us: they all got out upon the 
opposite side from Silver. 
Well, there we stood, two on one 
side, five on the other, the pit between. 
us, and nobody screwed up high 
enough to offer the first blow. Silver 193 
never moved; he watched them, very 5: 
upright on his crutch, and looked as 
cool as ever I saw him. He was brave 
and no mistake. 
At last, Merry seemed to think a 
speech might help matters. 
“Mates,” says he, “there’s two of 
them alone there; one’s the old 
cripple that brought us all here and 
blundered us down to this; the other’s 
that cub that I mean to have the 60 
heart of. Now, mates—” 
He was raising his arm and his 
voice, and plainly meant to lead a 
charge. But just then—crack! crack! 
crack! three musket-shots flashed out 
of the thicket. Merry tumbled head 
foremost into the excavation; the man 
with the bandage spun round like a 
teetotum, and fell all his length upon 
his side, where he lay dead, but still 70 
twitching; and the other three turned 
and ran for it with all their might. 
Before you could wink, Long John 
had fired two barrels of a pistol into 
the struggling Merry; and as the 
man rolled up his eyes at him in the 
last agony, “George,” said he, “I 
reckon I settled you.” 
At the same moment the doctor, 
Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us, with so 
smoking muskets, from among the 
nutmeg trees. 
“Forward!” cried the doctor. “Dou- 
ble quick, my lads. We must head 
em off the boats.” 
’ And we set. off at a great pace, 
sometimes plunging through the 
bushes to the chest. 
I tell you, but Silver was anxious 
to keep up with us. 
man went through, leaping on his* 
erutch till the muscles of his chest 
were fit to burst, was work no sound 
man ever equaled; and so thinks 
the doctor. As it was, he was already 
thirty yards behind us, and on the 
verge of strangling, when we reached 
the brow of the slope. The work that 90
-P-A-G-E-203
194 
“Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! no 
hurry!” 
Sure enough, there was no hurry. 
In a more open part of the plateau, 
‘we could see the three survivors still 
running in the same direction as 
they had started, right for Mizzenmast 
Hill. We were already between them 
and the boats; and so we four sat 
1o down to breathe, while Long John, 
mopping his face, came slowly up 
with us. 
“Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says 
he. “You came in in about the nick, 
I guess, for me and Hawkins. And 
so it’s you, Ben Gunn!’ he added: 
‘Well, you’re a nice one, to be sure.” 
“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” replied the 
maroon, wriggling like an eel in his 
20 embarrassment. “And,” he added, 
after a long pause, “how do, Mr. 
Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says 
you.” 
“Ben, Ben,” murmured Silver, “to 
think as you’ve done me!” 
The doctor sent back Gray for one of 
the pickaxes, deserted, in their flight, 
by the mutineers; and then as we 
proceeded leisurely down hill to where 
30 the boats were lying, related, in a 
few words, what had taken place. 
It was a story that profoundly in- 
terested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the 
half-idiot maroon, was the hero from 
beginning to end. 
Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings 
about the island, had found the skele- 
ton—it was he that had rifled it; he 
had found the treasure; he had dug 
40 it up (it was the haft of his pickax 
that lay broken in the excavation); 
*he had carried it on his back, in many 
weary journeys, from the foot of a 
tall pine to a cave he had on the two- 
pointed hill at the northeast angle of 
the island, and there it. had lain 
stored in safety since two months 
_ before the arrival of the Hispaniola. 
When the doctor had wormed this THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
secret from him, on the afternoon of 
the attack, and when, next morning, 
he saw the anchorage deserted, he had 
gone to Silver, given him the chart, 
which was now useless—given him 
_the stores, for Ben Gunn’s cave was 
well supplied with goats’ meat salted 
by himself—given anything and every- 
thing to get a chance pf moving in 
safety from the stockade to the two- 
pointed hill, there to be clear of 
malaria and keep a guard upon the 
moncy. 
“As for you, Jim,” he said, “it went 
against my heart, but I did what I 
thought best for those who had stood 
by their duty; and if you were not 
one of these, whose fault was it?” 
That morning, finding that I was 
to be involved in the horrid disap- 
pointment he had prepared for the 
mutineers, he had run all the way to the 
cave, and, leaving the squire to guard 
the captain, had taken Gray and the 
maroon, and started, making the 
diagonal across the island, to be at 
hand beside the pine. Soon, how- 
ever, he saw that our party had the 
start of him; and Ben Gunn, being 
fleet of foot, had been dispatched in 
front to do his best alone. Then it 
had occurred to him to work upon the 
superstitions of his former shipmates; 
and he was so far successful that Gray 
and the doctor had come up and were 
already ambushed before the arrival 
of the treasure-hunters. 
“Ah,” said Silver, “it were fortunate 
for me that I had Hawkins here: You 
would have let old John be cut to 
bits and never given it a thought, 
doctor.” 
“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Live- 
sey, cheerily. 
And by this time we had reached 
the gigs. The doctor, with the pickax, 
demolished one of them, and then we 
all got aboard the other and set out 
to go round by sea for North Inlet.
-P-A-G-E-204
TREASURE ISLAND 
This was a run of eight or nine 
miles." Silver, though he was almost 
killed already with fatigue, was set 
to an oar, like the rest of us, and we 
were soon skimming swiftly over a 
smooth sea. Soon we passed out of 
the straits and doubled the southeast 
corner of the island, round which, 
four days ago, we had towed the 
Hispaniola. 
As we passed the two-pointed hill, 
we could see the black mouth of Ben 
Gunn’s cave, and a figure standing by 
it, leaning on a musket. It was the 
squire; and we waved a handkerchief 
and gave him three cheers, in which 
the voice of Silver joined as heartily 
as any. 
Three miles farther, just inside the 
mouth of North Inlet, what should 
we meet but the Hispaniola, cruising 
by herself? ‘The last flood had lifted 
her; and had there been much wind, 
or a strong tide’ current, as in the 
southern anchorage, we should never 
have found her more, or found her 
stranded beyond help. As it was, 
there was little amiss, beyond the 
wreck of the mainsail. Another an- 
chor was got ready, and dropped in 
a fathom and a half of water. We all 
pulled round again to Rum Cove, the 
nearest point for Ben Gunn’s treasure- 
house; and then Gray, single-handed, 
returned with the gig to the His- 
paniola, where he was to pass the 
night on, guard. 
A gentle slope ran up from the 
beach to the entrance of the cave. 
At the top, the squire met us. To 
me he was cordial and kind, saying 
nothing of my escapade, either in the 
way of blame or praise. At Silver’s 
polite salute he somewhat flushed. 
“John Silver,” he said, “you’re a 
prodigious villain and impostor—a 
monstrous impostor, sir. I am told I 
am not to prosecute you. Well, then, 
I will not. But the dead men, sir, 195 
hang about your neck like millstones.” 
“Thank you kindly, sir,” replied 
Long John, again saluting. 
“J dare you to thank me!” cried the 
squire. “It is a gross dereliction of 
my duty. Stand back.” 
And thereupon we all entered the 
cave. It was a. large, airy place, 
with a little spring and a pool of clear 
water, overhung: with ferns. The 
floor was sand. Before a big fire lay 
Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, 
only duskily flickered over by the 
blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin 
and quadrilaterals built of bars of 
gold. That was Flint’s treasure that 
we had come so far to seek, and that 
had cost already lives of seventeen 
men from the Hispaniola. How many 
it had cost in the amassing, what blood 
and sorrow, what good ships scuttled 
on the deep, what brave men walking 
the plank blindfold, what shot of 
cannon, what shame and lies and 
cruelty, perhaps no man alive could 
tell. Yet there were still three upon 
that island—Silver, and old Morgan, 
and Ben Gunn—who had each taken 
his share in these crimes, as each had 
hoped in vain to share in the reward. 
“Come in, Jim,” said the captain. 
“You're a good boy in your line, Jim; 
but I don’t think yqu and me’ll go to 
sea, again. You’re too much of the 
born favorite for me. Is, that you, 
John Silver? What brings you here, 
man?” 
“Come back to my dooty, sir,” re- 
turned Silver. . 
“Ah!” said the captain; and that 
was all he said. 
What a supper I had of it that night, 
with all my. friends around me; and 
what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn’s 
salted goat, and some delicacies and 
a bottle of old wine from the His- 
paniola! Never, I am sure, were 
people gayer or happier. And there 
was Silver, sitting back almost out ‘70 
90
-P-A-G-E-205
196 
of the firelight, but eating heartily, 
prompt to spring forward when any- 
thing was wanted, even joining quictly 
in our laughter—the same bland, 
polite, obsequious seaman of the 
_ voyage out. 
10 
30 CHAPTER XXXIV 
Anp Last 
The next morning we fell early to 
work, for the transportation of this 
great mass of gold near a mile by 
land to the beach, and thence three 
miles by boat to. the Hispaniola, was 
a considerable task for so small a 
number of workmen. The three fel- 
lows still abroad upon the island did 
not greatly trouble us; a single sentry 
on the shoulder of the hill was suffi- 
cient to insure us against any sudden 
onslaught, and we thought, besides, 
they had had more than enough of 
fighting. 
Therefore, the work was pushed on 
briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came 
and went with the boat, while the 
rest, during their absences, piled 
treasure on the beach. Two of the 
bars, slung in a rope’s-end, made a 
good load for a grown man—one that 
he was glad to walk slowly with. For 
my part, as I was not much use at 
carrying, I was kept busy all day.in 
‘the cave, packing the minted money 
into bread-bags. 
It was a strange collection, like 
Billy Bones’s hoard for the diversity 
of coinage, but so much larger and so 
much more varied that I think I 
never had more pleasure than in sort- 
ing them. English, French, Spanish, 
Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, 
doubloons and double guineas and 
moidores and sequins, the pictures of 
all the kings of Europe for the last 
hundred years, strange Oriental pieces 
stamped with what looked like wisps cf 
string or bits of spider’s web, round THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
pieces and square pieces, and pieces 
bored through the middle, as if to 
wear them round your neck—nearly 
every variety of money-in the world 
must, I think, have found a place 
in that collection; and for number, I 
am sure they were like autumn leaves, 
so that my back ached with stooping 
and my fingers with sorting them out. 
Day after day this work went on; 
by every evening a fortune had been 
stowed aboard, but there was another 
fortune waiting for the morrow; and 
all this time we heard nothing of the 
three surviving mutineers. 
At last—I think it was on the 
third night—the doctor and I were 
strolling on the shoulder of the. hill 
where it overlooks the lowlands of the 
isle, when, from out the thick dark- 
ness below, the wind brought us a 
noise between shrieking and singing. 
It was only a snatch that reached our 
ears, followed by the-former silence. 
“Heaven forgive them,” said the | 
doctor; “tis the mutineers!” 
“All drunk, sir,”’ struck in the voice 
of Silver from behind us. 
Silver, I should say, was allowed 
his entire liberty, and, in spite of 
daily rebuffs, seemed to regard him- 
self once more as quite a privileged 
and friendly dependent. Indeed, it 
was remarkable how well he bore 
these slights, and with what un- 
wearying politeness he kept on trying 
to ingratiate himself with all. Yet, I 
think, none treated him better than 
a dog; unless it was Ben Gunn, who 
was still terribly afraid of his old 
quartermaster, or myself, who had 
really something to thank him for; 
although for that matter, I suppose, 
I had reason to think even worse of 
him than anybody else, for I had seen 
him meditating a fresh treachery upon 
the plateau. Accordingly, it was 
pretty gruffly that the doctor answered 
him.
-P-A-G-E-206
) 
& “Drunk or raving,” said he. 
“Right you were, sir,” replied Silver; 
you and me.” 
“I suppose you would hardly ask 
me to call you a humane man,” re- 
turned the doctor, with a sneer, “and 
so my feelings may surprise you, 
Master Silver. But if I were sure 
they were raving—as I am morally 
certain one, at least, of them is down 
with fever—I should leave this camp, 
and, at whatever risk to my own car- 
cass, take them the assistance of my 
skill.” 
“Ask your pardon, sir, you would 
be very wrong,” quoth Silver. “You 
would lose your precious life, and you 
may Jay to that. I’m on your side 
now, hand and glove; and I shouldn’t 
wish for to see the party weakened, 
let alone yourself, seeing as I know 
what I owes you. But these men 
down there, they couldn’t keep their 
word—no, not supposing they wished 
to; and what’s more, they couldn’t 
believe as you could.” 
“No,” said the doctor. “You're 
the man to keep your word, we know 
so that.’? 
Well, that was about the last news 
we had of the three pirates. Only 
once we heard a gunshot a great way 
off, and supposed them to be hunting. 
A council was held, and it was decided 
that we must desert them on the 
island—to the huge glee, I must say, 
cf Ben Gunn, and with the strong 
approval of Gray. We left a good 
stock of powder and shot, the bulk 
of the salt goat, a few medicines, and 
some other necessaries, tools, clothing, 
a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, 
and, by the particular desire of the 
doctor, a handsome present of tobacco. 
That was about our last doing on 
the island. Before that, we had got 
the treasure stowed, and had shipped 
enough water and the remainder of the TREASURE ISLAND 
“and precieus little odds which, to © goat meat, in case of any distress; 
and at last, one fine morning, we 
weighed anchor, which was about all 
that we could manage, and stood out 
of North Inlet, the same colors flying 
that the captain had flown and fought 
under at the palisade. 
_ The three fellows must have been 
watching us closer than we thought 
for, as we soon had proved. For, 
coming through the narrows, we had 
to lie very near the southern point, 
and there we saw all three of them 
kneeling together on a spit of sand, 
with their arms raised in supplication. 
It went to all our hearts, I think, 
to leave them in that wretched state; 
but we could not risk another mutiny; 
and to take them home for the 
gibbet would have been a cruel sort 
of kindness. The doctor hailed them 
and told them of the stores we had 
left, and where they were to find 
them. But they continued to call 
us by name, and appeal to us, for 
God’s sake to be merciful, and not 
leave them to die in such a place. 
At last, seeing the ship still bore 
on her course, and was now swiftly 197 — 
50 
drawing out of earshot, one of them— — 
I know not which it was—leaped to his 
feet and with a hoarse ery, whipped 
his musket to his shoulder, and sent 
a shot whistling over Silver’s head 
and through the mainsail. 
After that, we kept under cover of 
the bulwarks, and when next I looked 
out they had disappeared from the 
spit, and the spit itself had almost 
melted out of sight in the growing 
distance. That was, at least, the 
end of that; and before-noon, to my 
inexpressible joy, the highest rock 
of Treasure Island had sunk into the 
blue round of sea. : 
We were so short of men that every- 
one on board had to bear a hand— 
only the captain lying on a mattress in 
the stern and giving his orders; for, 90
-P-A-G-E-207
10 
20 
40 198 
though greatly recovered, he was still 
in want of quiet. We laid her head 
for the nearest port in Spanish 
America, for we could not risk the 
voyage home without fresh hands; 
and as it. was, what with baffling 
winds and a couple of fresh gales, 
we were all worn out before we 
reached it. 
It was just at sundown when we 
cast anchor in a most beautiful land- 
locked gulf, and were immediately 
surrounded by shore boats full of 
negroes, and Mexican Indians, and 
half-bloods, selling fruits and vege- 
tables, and offering to dive for bits 
of money. The sight of so many 
good-humored faces (especially the 
blacks), the taste of the tropical 
fruits, and above all, the lights that 
began to shine in the town, made a 
most charming contrast to our dark 
and bloody sojourn on the island; 
and the doctor and the squire, taking 
me along with them, went ashore to 
pass the early part of the night. 
Here they met the captain of an Eng- 
lish man-of-war, fell in talk with him, 
went on board his ship, and, in short, 
had so agreeable a time that day was 
breaking when we came alongside 
the Hispaniola. 
Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and, 
as soon as we came on board, he 
began, with wonderful contortions, 
to make us a confession. Silver was 
gone. The maroon had connived at 
his escape in a shore-boat some hours 
ago, and he now assured us he had 
only done so to preserve our lives, 
* which would certainly have been for- 
* feit if “that:'man with the one leg 
had stayed aboard.” But this was 
not all. The sea cook had not gone 
empty-handed. He had cut through 
-a bulkhead unobserved, and had re- 
moved one of the sacks of coin, worth, 
perhaps, three or four hundred guineas, 
to help him on his further wanderings. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
I think we were all pleased to be s 
cheaply quit of him. 
Well, to make a long 
we got a few hands on bc 
good cruise home, and th 
reached Bristol just as : 
was beginning to think of f 
consort. Five men only 
had sailed returned with I 
and the devil had done f 
with a vengeance; alth 
sure, we were not quite _ _. 
case as that other ship they san, 
about: 
With one man of her crew alive, 
What put to sea with seventy-five. 
All of us had an ample sha 
treasure, and used it wisely 
ishly, according to our nature

but, being suddenly smitten 
desire to rise, also studied 
fession; and he is now mate ; 
owner of a fine full-rigged shi

thousand pounds, which he spent or 
lost in three weeks, or, to be more

Of Silver we have heard no more. 
That formidable seafaring man with 
one leg has at last gone clean ou

negress, and perhaps still lives in «

THE END 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
/- _~1. In the introductory poem “To the Hesi- 
tating Purchaser,” page 85, Stevenson men- 
tions “sailor tales to sailor tunes”; what are 
some of the sailor tunes in this sailor tale? 
What is their purpose in the story? Judging 
other young people by yourself, which one of 
the two conditions described in the poem do 
you think holds true today? Can some rime- 
ster in your class answer Stevenson in an 
eight-line stanza similar to his? You will enjoy 
hearing “Pirate Song” (Gilbert), sung by 
David Bispham, Columbia phonograph record. 
2. Turn back to Part I and notice the various 
ways in which the readers’ curiosity is aroused 
in “the seafaring man with one leg.” Discuss 
the character of Captain Silver. Do you 
dislike him as much as he deserves? 
8. Imagining a scenario for Part VI, tell 
the incidents related to: the stockade; the 
cache; Ben Gunn’s cave; on board the His- 
paniola. Which picture is unforgetable? 
Class Reading. The voice among the trees, 
Chapter XXXII, Tur Srory as 4 WHOLE 
1. Prepare a report, giving in a brief para- 
graph the plot of Treasure Island as you would 
tell it to one who had not read the story. 
2. Read again the quotation from Steven- 
son given on page 105. Do you think that 
Treasure Island meets the test of a true story 
as laid down by the author in this passage? 
3. You read on page 79 that “Any great 
book is the expression of the innermost person- 
ality of its author”; can you show a parallel 
between this story and its author? 
4. In the Introduction to “The World of 
Adventure,” page 9, you read that “‘the first 
test of literature is its power to take us out of 
ourselves”; how does Treasure Island meet this 
test? 
5. Compare this story about pirates’ trea- 
sure with Poe’s “The Gold Bug.”

James FENIMORE COOPER 
CHAPTER V 
Through Solway sands, through Taross 
moss, 
Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross; 
By wily turns; by desperate bounds, 
Had baffled Percy’s best bloodhounds. 
In Eske or Liddel, fords were none 
But he would ride them, one by one; 
Alike to him was time or tide, 
December’s snow or July’s pride; 
Alike to him was tide or time, 
Moonless midnight or matin prime. 
—Walter Scott 
All the members of the Wharton 
family laid their heads on their pillows 
that night, with a foreboding of some 
interruption to their ordinary quiet. 
Uneasiness kept the sisters from en- 
joying their usual repose, and they 
rose from their beds, on the following 
morning, unrefreshed, and almost 
without having closed their eyes. 
10 On taking an eager and hasty survey 
of the valley from the windows of 
their room, nothing, however, but its 
usual serenity was to be seen. It was 
glittering with the opening brilliancy 
of one of those lovely, mild days which 
occur about the time of the falling of 
the leaf; and which, by their frequency, 
class the American autumn with the 
most delightful seasons of other 
20 countries. We have no spring; vege- 
tation seems to leap into existence, in- 
stead of creeping, as in the same lati- 
tudes of the old world; but how grace- 
fully it retires! September, October; 
even November and December, com- 
pose the season for enjoyment in the 
open air; they have their storms, but 
they are distinct, and not of long con- 
tinuance, leaving a clear atmosphere 
30 and a cloudless sky. - “Ido acknowledg: As nothing co

proach of her troops just now would 
give me great pain.” 
The brother made no reply; but re- 
turning the fondness expressed in her 
eye by a look of fraternal tenderness, 
he gently pressed her hand in silence; 
when Cesar, who had participated 
largely in the anxiety of the family, 
and who had risen with the dawn, and 
kept a vigilant watch on the surround- 
ing objects, as he stood gazing from 
one of the windows, exclaimed with a 
face that approached to something 
like the hues of a white man, 
“Run—Massa Harry—run—if he 
love old Ceesar—run—here come a 
rebel horse.” 
“Run!” repeated the British officer, 
gathering himself up in military pride; 
“no, Mr. Cesar, running is not my 
trade.” While speaking, he walked 
deliberately to the window, where the 
family were already collected in the 
greatest consternation. 
At the distance of more than a mile, 
about fifty dragoons were to be seen, 
winding down one of the lateral en- 
trances of the valley. In advance with 
an officer was a man attired in the 
dress of a countryman, who pointed in 
the direction of the cottage. A small 
party now left the main body, and 
moved rapidly toward the object of 
their destination. 
On reaching the road which led 
through the bottom of the valley, they 
turned their horses’ heads to the north. 
The Whartons continued chained in 
breathless silence to the spot, watch- 
ing their movements, when the party, 
having reached the dwelling of Birch, 
made a rapid circle around his grounds, 
and in an instant his house was sur- 
rounded by a dozen sentinels. 
Two or three of the dragoons now 
dismounted and:disappeared; in a few 
minutes, however, they returned to 
the yard, followed by Katy, from 
whose violent gesticulations it was 
li 201 
evident that matters of no trifling 
concern were on the carpet. A short 
communication with the loquacious 
housekeeper followed the arrival of 
the main body of the troop, and the 
advanced party remounting, the whole 
moved toward the Locusts with great 
speed. 
As yet none of the family had suffi- 
cient presence of mind to devise any 
means of security for Captain Whar- 
ton; but the danger now became too 
pressing to admit of longer delay,.and 
various means of secreting him were 
hastily proposed; but they were all 
haughtily rejected by the young man, 
as unworthy of his character. It was 
too late to retreat to the woods in the 
rear of the cottage, for he would un- 
avoidably be seen, and, followed by a 
troop of horse, as inevitably taken. 
At length his sisters, with trembling 
hands, replaced his original disguise, 
the instruments of which had been 
carefully kept at hand by Cesar, in 
expectation of some sudden emergency. 
This arrangement was hastily and ~ 
imperfectly completed, as the dragoons 
entered the lawn and orchard of the 
Locusts, riding with the rapidity of 
the wind; and in their turn the 
Whartons were surrounded. 
Nothing remained now but to meet 
the impending examination with as 
much indifference as the family could | 
assume. The leader of the horse dis- 
mounted, and, followed by a couple of 
his men, he approached the outer door 
of the building, which was slowly and 
reluctantly opened for his adniission 
by Cesar. The heavy tread of the 
trooper, as he followed the black to 
the door of the parlor, rang in the ears 
of the females as it approached nearer 
and nearer, and drove the blood from 
their faces to their hearts, with a chill _ 
that nearly annihilated feeling. 
A man, whose colossal stature mani- 
fested the possession of vast strength,
-P-A-G-E-211
202 
entered the room, and removing his 
cap, he saluted the family with a mild- 
ness his appearance did not indicate 
as belonging to his nature. His dark 
hair hung around his brow in profusion, 
though stained with the powder which 
was worn at that day, and his face 
was nearly hid in the whiskers by 
which it was disfigured. Still, the ex- 
pression of his eye, though piercing, 
was not bad, ‘and his voice, though 
deep and powerful, was far from un- 
pleasant. Frances. ventured to throw 
a timid glance at his figure as he 
entered, and saw at once the man from 
whose scrutiny Harvey Birch had © 
warned them there was so much to 
be apprehended. 
“You have no cause for alarm, 
ladies,” said the officer, pausing a 
moment, and contemplating the pale 
faces around him-—‘‘my business will: 
be confined to a few questions, which, 
if freely answered, will instantly re- 
move us from your dwelling.” 
“And what may they be, sir?’ 
~ stammered Mr. Wharton, rising from 
his chair, and waiting anxiously for 
the reply. . : 
“Has there been a strange gentle- 
man staying with you during the 
storm?” continued the dragoon, speak- 
ing with interest, and in some degree 
sharing in the evident anxiety of the 
father. 
“This gentleman—here—favored us 
with his company during the rain, and 
has not yet departed.” 
“This gentleman!” repeated the 
other, turning to Captain Wharton, 
and contemplating his figure for a 
moment, until the anxiety of his coun- 
tenance gave place to a lurking smile. 
He approached the youth with an air 
of comic gravity, and with a low bow, 
continued—‘“‘I am sorry for the severe 
cold you have in your head, sir.” 
“I,” exclaimed. the Captain, in sur- 
prise; “I have no éold. in my head.” ' THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
“T fancied it then, from seeing you 5 
had covered such handsome black 
locks with that ugly old wig; it was 
my mistake, you will please to pardon 
it.” 
Mr. Wharton groaned aloud; but 
the ladies, ignorant of the extent of 
their visitor’s knowledge, remained in 
trembling, yet rigid, silence. The 
Captain himself. moved his hand in- 
voluntarily to his head, and discovered 
that the trepidation of his sisters had 
left some of his natural hair exposed. 
The dragoon watched the movement 
with a continued smile, when, seeming 
to recollect himself, turning to the 
father, he proceeded, 
“Then, sir, J am to understand there 
has not been a Mr. Harper here 
within the week.” 
“Mr. Harper,” echoed the other, : 
feeling a load removed from his heart 
—‘yes— I had forgotten; but he is 
gone; and if there be anything wrong 
in his character, we are in entire igno- 
rance of it—to me he was a total 
stranger.” 
“You have but little to apprehend 
from his character,” answered the 
dragoon dryly ; “‘but he is gane—how— 
when—and whither?” § 
“He departed as he arrived,” said 
Mr. Wharton, gathering renewed con- 
fidence from the manner of the trooper; 
“on horseback, last evening, and he 
took the northern road.” 
The officer listened to him with in- 
tense interest, his countenance gradu- 
ally lighting into a smile of pleasure; 
and the instant Mr. .Wharten. con- 
cluded his laconic reply, he turned on 
his heel and left the apartment. The 
Whartons, judging from his manner, 
thought he was about to proceed in 
quest of the object of his inquiries. 
They observed the dragoon, on gain- 
ing the lawn, in earnest, and. appar- — 
ently pleased, conversation with his 
two subalterns. In a few moments
-P-A-G-E-212
5S s THE 
orders were given to some of the troop, 
and horsemen left the valley, at full 
speed, ‘by its various roads. 
The suspense of the party within, 
who were all highly interested wit- 
nesses of this scene, was shortly 
terminated; for the heavy tread of the 
dragoon soon ‘announced his second 
approach. He bowed again politely 
as he reéntered the room, and walking 
up to Captain Wharton, said, with 
comic gravity, 
’ “Now, ‘sir, my principal business 
being done, may I beg to examine the 
quality of that wig?” ‘The British officer imitated the 
manner of the other, as he deliberately 
uncovered his head, and handing him 
the wig, observed, “I hope, sir, it is 
to your liking.” 
“I cannot, without violating the 
truth, say it is,” returned the dragoon; 
_“T prefer your ebony hair, from which 
you seem 'to have combed the powder 
with gréat industry. But that must 
have been a sad hurt you have received 
under this enormous black patch.” 
“You appear so close an observer of 
things, { should like your opinion of 
it; sir,” said Henry, removing the silk, 
and exhibiting the cheek free from 
blemish. 
“Upon my word, you improve most 
rapidly ‘in externals,” added the 
trooper, preserving his muscles in in- 
flexible gravity. “If I could but per- 
suade you to exchange this old surtout 
for that handsome blue coat by your 
side, I think I never could witness a 
more agreeable ‘metamorphosis, since 
i-was changed myself from’a lieutenant 
to a captain.” : 
Young Wharton very composedly 
did as was required; and stood an 
extremely ‘handsome, well-dressed 
young man. The dragoon looked at 
him for ‘a minute with the drollery 
that ‘characterized his manner, and 
then continued— SPY 208 
- “This is a newcomer in the scene; 
it is usual, you know, for strangers to 
be introduced; I am Captain Lawton, 
of ‘the Virginia horse.” 
“And I, sir, ‘am Captain Wharton, 
of his Majesty’s 60th regiment of foot,” 
returned Henry, ‘bowing stiffly, and 
recovering his natural manner. 
The countenance of Lawton changed 
instantly, and ‘his assumed quaintness 
vanished.. He viewed the figure of 
Captain Wharton, as he stood proudly 
swelling with a pride that disdained 
further concealment, and exclaimed, 
‘with great earnestness, 
“Captain Wharton, from my soul I 
pity you!” 
“Qh! then,” cried the father in 
agony, “if you pity him, dear sir, why 
molest him? He is not a spy; nothing 
but a desire to see his friends prompted 
him to venture so far from the regular 
army in disguise. Leave him with us; 
there is no reward, no sum, which I 
will not cheerfully pay.” 
“Sir, your anxiety for your friend 
excuses your language,” said Lawton, 
haughtily; “but you forget I am a 
Virginian and a gentleman.” Turning 
to the young man, he continued, 
“Were you ignorant, Captain Whar- 
ton, that our pickets have been below 
you for several days?” 
“T did not know it until I reached 
them, and it was then too late to 
retreat,” said Wharton, sullenly. “T 
came out, as my father has mentioned, 
to see my friends, understanding your 
parties to be at Peekskill, and near 
the Highlands, or surely I would not 
have ventured.” 
“All this may be very true; but the 
affair of André has made us on the 
alert. When treason reaches the grade 
of general officers, Captain ‘Wharton, 
it behooves the ‘friends of liberty to be 
vigilant.” 
Henry bowed ta this remark in dis- 
tant silence, but Sarah ventured to 50
-P-A-G-E-213
10 204 
urge something in behalf of her 
brother. The dragoon heard her 
politely, and apparently with com- 
miseration; but willing to avoid use- 
less and embarrassing petitions, he 
answered mildly, 
“I am not the commander of the 
party, madam; Major Dunwoodie will 
decide what must be done with your 
brother; at all events, he will receive 
nothing but kind and gentle treat- 
ment.” , 
“Dunwoodie!’”’ exclaimed Frances, 
with a face in which the roses con- 
tended for the mastery with the pale- 
ness of apprehension; ‘Thank God! 
then Henry is safe!” 
Lawton regarded her with a mingled 
expression of pity and admiration; 
then shaking his head doubtingly, he 
continued, 
“I hope so; and with your permis- 
sion, we will leave the matter for his 
decision.” 
The color of Frances changed from 
the paleness of fear to the glow of hope. 
Her dread on behalf of her brother 
was certainly greatly diminished; yet 
her form shook, her breathing became 
short and irregular, and her whole 
frame gave tokens of extraordinary 
agitation. Her eyes rose from the 
floor to the dragoon, and were again 
fixed immovably on the carpet—she 
evidently wished to utter something, 
but was unequal to the effort. Miss 
Peyton was a close observer of these 
movements of her niece, and advanc- 
ing with an air of feminine dignity, 
inquired, 
“Then, sir, we may expect the 
‘ pleasure of Major Dunwoodie’s com- 
pany shortly?” 
“Immediately, madam,”’ answered 
the dragoon, withdrawing his admiring 
gaze from the person of Frances; 
“expresses are already on the road to 
announce to him our situation, and 
47. expresses, messengers. THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE 
the intelligence will speedily bring him 
to this valley; unless, indeed, some 
private reasons may exist to make a 
visit particularly unpleasant.” 
“We shall always be happy to see 
Major Dunwoodie.” 
“Oh! doubtless; he is a general 
favorite. May I presume on it so far 
as to ask leave to dismount and re- 
fresh my men, who compose a part 
of his squadron?” 
There was a manner about the 
trooper that would have made the 
omission of such a request easily for- 
given by Mr. Wharton, but he was 
fairly entrapped by his own eagerness 
to conciliate, and it was useless to 
withhold a consent which he thought 
would probably be extorted; he, there- 
fore, made the most of necessity, and 
gave such orders as would facilitate 
the wishes of Captain Lawton. 
The officers were invited to take 
their morning’s repast at. the family 
breakfast table, and having made 
their arrangements without, the invi- 
tation was frankly accepted. None of 
the watchfulness, which was so neces- 
sary to their situation, was neglected 
by the wary partisan. Patrols were 
seen on the distant hills, taking their 
protecting circuit around their com- 
rades, who were enjoying, in the midst 
of dangers, a security that can only 
spring from the watchfulness of dis- 
cipline and_ the indifference of habit. 
The addition to the party at Mr. 
Wharton’s table was only three, and 
they were all of them men who, under 
the rough exterior induced by actual 
and arduous service, concealed the 
manners of gentlemen. Consequently, ; 
the interruption to the domestic pri- 
vacy of the family was marked by the 
observance of strict decorum. The 
ladies left the table to their guests, 
who proceeded, without much super- 
fluous diffidence, to do proper honors 
to the hospitality of Mr. Wharton. ¢
-P-A-G-E-214
6 THE SPY ‘ 
At length Captain Lawton  sus- 
pended for a moment his violent 
attacks on the buckwheat cakes, to 
inquire of the master of the house if 
there was not a peddler of the name of 
Birch who lived in the valley at times. 
“At times only, I believe, sir,” re- 
plied Mr. Wharton, cautiously; “‘he is 
seldom here; I may say I never see 
him.” 
“That is strange, too,” said the 
trooper, looking at the disconcerted 
host intently, “considering he is your 
next neighbor; he must be quite 
domestic, sir; and to the ladies it must 
be somewhat inconvenient. I doubt 
not that that muslin in the window- 
seat cost twice as much as he would 
have asked them for it.” 
Mr. Wharton turned in consterna- 
tion, and saw some of the recent pur- 
chases scattered about the room. 
The two subalterns struggled to con- 
ceal their smiles; but the Captain re- 
sumed his breakfast with an eagerness 
that created a doubt whether he ever 
expected to enjoy another. The neces- 
sity of a supply from the dominion of 
Dinah soon, however, afforded another 
respite, of which Lawton availed him- 
self, 
“T had a wish to break this Mr. 
Birch of his unsocial habits, and gave 
him a call this morning,” he said; 
“had I found him within, I should 
have placed him where he would enjoy 
life in the midst of society, for a short 
time at least.” 
“And where might that be, sir?” 
asked Mr. Wharton, conceiving it 
necessary to say something. 
“The guardroom,” said the trooper, 
dryly. 
“What is the offense of poor Birch?” 
asked Miss Peyton, handing the dra- 
goon a fourth dish of coffee. 
“Poor!” cried the Captain; “if he is 
Poor, King George is a bad pay- 
master.” 205. 
“Yes, indeed,” said one of the 50 
subalterns, “his Majesty owes him a 
dukedom.” 
“And Congress a halter,’’ continued 
the commanding officer, commencing 
anew on a fresh supply of the cakes. 
“T am sorry,” said Mr. Wharton, 
“that any neighbor of mine should 
incur the displeasure of our rulers.” 
“If I catch him,” cried the dragoon, 
while buttering another cake, “he will 
dangle from the limbs of one of his 
namesakes.” 
“Heé would make no bad ornament, 
suspended from one of those locusts 
before his own door,” added the 
Lieutenant. . 
“Never mind,” continued the Cap- 
tain; “I will have him yet before I’m 
a major.” 
As the language of these officers 
appeared to be sincere, and such as 
disappointed men in their rough occu- 
pations are but too apt to use, the 70 
_ Whartons thought it prudent to dis- 
continue the subject. It was no new 
intelligence to any of the family that 
Harvey Birch was distrusted, and 
greatly harassed, by the American 
army. His escapes from their hands, 
no less than his imprisonments, had 
been the conversation of the country 
in too many instances, and under cir- 
cumstances of too great mystery, to 
be easily forgotten. In fact, no small 
part of the bitterness expressed by 
Captain Lawton against the peddler 
- arose from the unaccountable disap- 
pearance of the latter, when intrusted 
to the custody of two of his most 
faithful dragoons. 
A twelvemonth had not yet elapsed 
since Birch had been seen lingering 
near the headquarters of the com- 
mander-in-chief, and at a time when 
important movements were expected 
hourly to occur. So soon as the in- 
formation of this fact was communi- 
cated to the officer, whose duty it was 90 
on
-P-A-G-E-215
10 te guard the avenues of the American 
camp, he dispatched Captain Lawtoti 
in pursuit of the peddler. 
“Acquainted with all the’ passes of 
the hills, and indefatigable in the dis- 
charge of his duty, the trooper had, 
with much trouble and toil, succeeded 
in effecting his dbject.” The patty had 
halted at a farmhouse for the purposes 
of ‘refreshment, and the prisoner ‘was 
* placed in 4 room by himself; but under 
30 the keeping of the two men before 
mentioned; all that was known ‘sub- 
sequently is that a woman was seen 
busily engaged in the employments of 
the household near the sentinels, and 
was particularly attentive to the wants 
of the captain, until he was. deeply 
engaged in the’ employments of the 
supper-table, 
Afterwards, neither woman nor 
peddler was to be found.” "The pack, 
indeed, was discovered open, and 
nearly empty, and a small, door, com- 
municating ‘with a room adjoining to 
the one in which the peddler had been 
secured, was ajar. 
Captain Lawton never could forgive 
the deception; his antipathies to his

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expranatory Notes 
1. The Relation of The Spy to Cooper’s 
‘Other Works. ‘The principal novels of James 
- Fenimore Cooper fall into two classes. To the 
first belong the stories of Indian life and of the 
conquest, of the wilderness by the whites, 
This series begins with Pioneers, published in 
1828, and includes Thx Last of the Mohicans, 
The Prairie, The Pathfinder, and The Deerslayer. 
Cooper got his material for these stories from 
his life in western New York at a time when 
that part of our country was almost a wilderness. ‘The second division of his novels is made up 
of stories of the sea,.and begins with The Pilot, 
published in 1823, ‘These sea-stories draw upon 
Cooper’s experience of several years in the navy. 
The Spy, published anonymously i in 1821, was 
his first great work, ‘and its rapid’success deter- 
mined the young author to enter upon a literary 
career. 
2. ‘Sources and ‘Setting of The Spy. 
Cooper's first attempt. at fiction was 2 novel 
called Precaution published anonymously in 
1820. This work was severely criticized “for
-P-A-G-E-216
THE SPY 
its English setting and supposedly pro-British 
_sympathies. Cooper was an intensely patriotic 
man, and his reply to the criticisms was. a 
novel in which, as he said, the theme was 
patriotism. ‘The idea of the story came to the 
author from a tale that had been told him, 
years previously, by John Jay, one of the 
greatest Americans of the Revolutionary 
period. The theme of this tale was’ the 
patriotism of a humble man who would 
suffer even the.loss of his reputation for his 
country’ssake. Besides this suggestion, worked 
out by Cooper in his story of Harvey Birch, 
there are many incidents which reflect actual 
conditions in the neutral Westchester country 
during the Revolution. These incidents Cooper 
got, in many cases, from men and women who 
had lived through them, for The Spy was 
written when the nation was yet young enough 
for its history to be included in a single lifetime. 
The setting of the story, and also the scenes 
which it describes, may be traced to actual 
experience, for Cooper had lived in Westchester 
and knew the country. Thus The Spy, like 
Leatherstocking. and the sea-tales, is based on 
the actual life of the author. He wrote from 
first-hand knowledge, not purely from the 
imagination. 
3. The Story of Chapters ILIV. The 
scene of The Spy is laid in Westchester county, 
New York, during the time of the American 
Revolutionary War. The British hold the 
city of New-York. Mr. Wharton, who is 
striving to maintain strict neutrality until he 
sees which side is to be victorious, has removed. 
his family from the city to his country home, 
the Locusts. His family, however, refuse to 
be neutral. His son Henry is a captain in the 
British army; his elder daughter Sarah is being 
courted by the British Colonel Wellmere; while 
the youngest, Frances, is in love with Peyton 
Dunwoodie, a Virginia major in the American 
forces; Miss Jeanette Peyton of Virginia, sister 
of Mr. Wharton’s deceased wife, superintends 
the Wharton household. Near the Whartons 
lives the peddler, Harvey Birch, whose mys- 
terious actions have led many to believe that 
he is a royal spy.

mainly about men and women.and what 
they‘do.- Some of the selections are heroic. 
Others deal with crime. Some deal real-

‘You sill tletice, as you look ‘over the 
selections ‘that-are here grouped under the

. Moreover, you will find. several of the: 
great types of literature illustrated. in this 
section. ‘You-will be. helped to understand 
what: the word “type”: means. if you con-

dents.. Suppose; for'example, your. grand-

would have a drama, Or these incidents, 
and others like them, might be the basis 
of an investigation into the colonization 
of Montana or Nevada or California. You 
would have a history as the result. If the 
story were limited to the life and achieve-. 
ments. of one of the great pioneers, the 
result would be a biography. Finally, a 
great poet might read these and other 
stories and legends and histories about the 
Conquest of the Great Divide, the push 
of civilization westward across the moun- 
tains, and then might write, in stately and 
measured verse, this story of a civilization. 
The result would be an epic. 
Thus you see that there are many ways 
of handling the material out of which 
literature is made. Men have used these 
ways for so long that a certain amount of 
method has been developed, marking the 
difference between one type, or way of tell- 
ing a story, and another. Ballad and epic, 
short story and novel, drama and history, 
have certain characteristics that you may 
observe. By observing them, your story 
becomes more than a story. . 
seg 
The characteristics of several of these 
types of ‘literature will be set forth in 
special introductions. At this time it is 
only. necessary to point out certain broad 
resemblances and differences. The epic, 
which many people for many centuries 
have regarded as the highest form of 
poetry, is of ancient origin. In the strict 
sense, it is itself a summary of a whole 
civilization. Its hero is regarded as the 
founder of the nation. The plot of the 
poem is the life story of this hero, told 
in such a way that his great services to his 
people are commemorated. His life is 
shown to have been directed by super- 
natural forces. Woven into the story are” 
pictures of the civilization of which the epic 
is the outgrowth, and the whole story is 
told in an elevated and stately manner. 
Frequently the episodes of which the poem 
is composed are heroic legends, perhaps 
ballads, that arose-among the people and 
were handed down through generations. 
Thus the ballad, in a sense, is the raw 
material out of which the epic developed. 
Various legends about Odysseus, or Ulys- ' elements are present. LEGEND AND HISTORY 
ses, perhaps in ballad form, were thus put 
together by one or more poets. Similarly, 
the early English epic of Beowulf_is made 
up of several very ancient legends, partly 
historical and partly legendary in the 
strict sense. There have come down to us 
a number of ballads about Robin Hood 
and his life in the greenwood. These were 
never woven together into an epic, but 
they show very well the material out of 
which epics were made. 
‘Ballads are more simple in structure 
than the epic. The folk ballads, which 
have only recently been written down after 
centuries of oral tradition, are always of 
unknown authorship. Folk epic, by which 
is meant the epic that is the result of 
generations of tradition before coming to 
written form, is also as a rule anonymous. 
But the epic is more highly developed than 
the ballad; it belongs to a cultivated soci- 
ety. The ballad aims only to tell a story 
briefly and dramatically. It is not con- 
cerned with reflections on social matters 
or the origin of a people. 
In the heroic romance, such as Scott’s 
Lady of the Lake, many ballad and epic 
Such poems are 
commonly written in a relatively ad- 
vanced state of civilization, by an educated 
man for an educated audience. Many such 
romances were written in the later Middle 
Ages, chiefly in France, Germany, and 
England. The romances about Arthur 
and his knights are examples. In them 
heroic deeds, the efforts of the hero to 
win personal distinction, to realize his 
ambitions for himself, form the basis. They 
may deal with authentic history, and they 
often tell us a great deal, indirectly, about 
the social ideals of the time. They may 
also include purely legendary matter. The 
heroic romance may be prose, such as 
Malory’s Morte d’ Arthur, written in Eng- 
land in the fifteenth century, or such as 
Scott’s Ivanhoe, written in the nineteenth 
century, but seeking to resurrect the days 
of chivalry. 
/ Finally we have the dramas that deal 
with legend and history. In a time when 
English history was little more ‘than a 
chronicle, without much story and with 
no organization or interpretation, Shake- 
speare:- began to tell, in dramatic form, the
-P-A-G-E-222

.f LEGEND. AND HISTORY 
of-great English kings. His work 
ised on the chronicles, and is thus 
to history, but he added many 
and characters so as to make his 
3 lifelike, and he often altered the 
f history so that they would better 
plan. Nevertheless, our opinion of 
ke Henry V or Richard III has been 
ced by Shakespeare’s plays rather 
chan by what historians have told 
the facts about these kings. In 
Caesar and other plays, Shakespeare 
sized Roman history. Thus we see 
new nistory may be made the basis of 
drama as well as of epic. In fact, some of 
Shakespeare’s historical plays, such as 
Henry V, have many epic characteristics. 
This little bird’s-eye view of what you 
are about to read will show how these 
various types of literature, written in 
widely different times, have a common 
relationship. The same story, as we have 
already noticed, may be told in various 
ways, and each of these ways involves a 
certain technique, or art, dependent on the 
form or type used by the author. Plutarch, 
a great scholar, studies legends and chroni- 
cles about Caesar. His work is translated, 
by way of France, into English prose. A 
dramatist uses this as the basis for his play. 
This play is acted in widely different ways 
at various periods. The Elizabethan theater 
was very different from ours; in the eight- 
eenth century still' other ideals of dramatic 
presentation were found. At present we 
may see an Elizabethan revival of Julius 
Caesar, or a gorgeous modern presentation 
of it, or we may even see it in the moving 
picture theater. Such, then, has been the 
evolution of the story: first, authentic 
history about a man who actually lived; 
then, legend in verse and prose about him; 
then a drama in which his story is told by 
words and through action; finally, a series 
of pictures so wonderfully done that they 
seem to bring before our eyes the scenes 
in which Caesar played a part, a picture- 
story told without language at all. 
TI 
Resides reading this material for the 
es that it tells, and besides reading it 
he sake of knowing something about 
works of great writers, several other. 
  213 
important things for you to do will doubt- 
Jess occur to you in view of this introduc- 
tion. 
In the first place, you have a better 
chance now than you have had earlier in 
your course to learn something about 
several of the great literary types. By 
keeping your eye of observation open, you 
can learn more about these types from the 
selections here given than through any 
number of lectures or books. For exam- 
ple, you may study plot, as handled in an 
epic like the Odyssey, a ballad like Otter- 
bourne, a romance like The Lady of the Lake, 
and a drama like Julius Caesar. You may 
study characterization in the same way. 
You may also study the social life, the 
ideas of what the true man should be and. 
do, the ideals of manners, citizenship, 
religion, and the like, in these same works 
that represent widely different periods of 
civilization. By such a plan of study you 
will find your knowledge of the history 
of these periods greatly clarified and in- 
creased. 
Again, you have an opportunity to create 
something for yourself. You read a 
moment ago about the long history of the 
story of Caesar as it has been interpreted 
by men twenty centuries apart. What 
Shakespeare did with the old chronicles 
is what. you should do for yourself as you 
read. The chronicles were the mere frame- 
work which he used for re-creating the life 
of past time. He visualized it; saw %. 
When you go to the picture-show, you find 
a story set forth in a series of pictures. This 
is what you should do for yourself as you 
read ballad, legend, history. You should 
re-create, for yourself, the life of the past 
times. Every reader, if his imagination is 
awake, may make his own series of moving 
pictures, his own pageant of history and 
legend. 
Finally, these selections deal for the most 
part with men as individuals, not with men 
in the mass. The great social and political 
movements, such as the rise of modern 
democracy, are not represented. The man 
who seeks for personal distinction, or wha 
meets some crisis bravely, or bears up under 
adverse fates, or, on the other hand, the 
man who fails in a crisis because of some 
flaw in his character—such are the heroes
-P-A-G-E-223
214 
of ballad, epic, and heroic drama. Thus 
these stories answer to our yery human 
curiosity about people. They deal with 
men who acted as we should like to act, or 
who failed to. meet a test that may come 
to us. In them we see our own real or 
imaginary experience. We may” escape 
from the ordinary routine: of life. For 
ee LEGEND. AND HISTORY / ‘, 
these are not merely stories of adventure. 
They are, many of them, ,synibols of all 
human life. Therefore they represent, as 
in a moving picture, the heroism, the tri- 
umphs, the failures of men as they are 
confronted by the realities of living and 
by some of the mysteries ‘that surround 
man’s destiny.

HOMER’S “ODYSSEY” 
AN INTRODUCTION 
The ‘poem from which this selection is is said, the ten years’ war at Troy came 
taken is one of the oldest in the world. eabout, for Menelaus enlisted the aid of 
It deals with a civilization that was highly 
developed before the dawn of history, and 
some of the material in this poem was 
ancient even when that civilization was 
at its height. 
The Odyssey is one of the two great epic 
poems ascribed to Homer, About Homer 
nothing is known. Many legends have 
grown up around. his name, such as his 
blindness, his poverty, the fame that came 
to him after death so that seven cities 
competed for the honor of being called his 
birthplace. But all this is legend; we 
know nothing. It is even doubtful if one 
man composed the whole of the Odyssey 
or of the Ikad, the other great epic 
ascribed to Homer. It is doubtful if the 
two poems were by the same man, even 
if each was the complete work of one man. 
And it is certain that these two poems 
are only two out of many epics composed. 
in ancient Greece; some of the others are 
known by name, but the poems themselves 
disappeared before men began to keep 
records of their thoughts and imaginations, 
or perished among the wrecks of Time. 
All that we know is that by some miracle 
two long Greek poems, each of them con- 
taining twenty- four parts, or “books,” each 
perfect in structure and composition, have . 
come down to us. Both of them are 
related to the so-called Trojan War. We 
know where Troy once stood, in Asia 
Minor, and it is probable that the region 
was once ruled by a powerful king. But 
we have no records of Troy, of the king, 
or of its people. We do not know in 
what century it flourished, or the date of 
its fall, There are legends about Helen, 
the beautiful wife of Menelaus, king of 
Sparta, who was carried off by Paris in 
consequence of the promise made to him 
by Venus, the goddess to whom Paris had 
awarded the golden apple. From this, it the great Agamemnon and the other 
Greek warriors and they set sail for Troy, 
whither Paris and Helen had fled. The 
entire story carries us back to the realms 
of ancient myth. It is probably the most 
famous story in the world, for not only 
were the Homeric legends connected with 
it in one way or another, but Vergil’s 
Aeneid, the greatest poem produced by 
Roman genius, is a continuation of it, 
while it was used as the basis of poems 
and histories throughout the Middle Ages, 
has influenced many. modern poets, and. 
has become a part of the literature of all 
modern peoples. 
The influence of the legend of Troy and 
its literature has been enormous. Whole 
libraries have been written about the 
legend, about Homer, and about the 
poems ascribed to his name. Men have 
given their whole lives to the study of some 
of these problems. When you read this 
selection, therefore, you come into contact 
with one of the most interesting of all the 
manifestations of human genius. 
I 
The Iliad and the Odyssey are quite 
different, and illustrate two different 
forms of epic poetry. The Iliad, as its 
name indicates, deals with Ilium, or Troy, 
and is concerned with the last year of the 
war. Its action covers only a few: days, 
and it does not tell about the fall of the 
city. The theme of the poem is the wrath 
of Achilles and its effects. Achilles, the 
greatest of the Greek warriors, became 
angry because of an injustice that had 
been done him by his king, and refused 
to take any further part in the siege of 
the city. He remained in his tent, nurs- 
ing his anger, deaf to the entreaties of 
the other leaders. The poem describes 
some of the battles, and finally tells how 
21E
-P-A-G-E-225
216 
Hector, whose rank and fame among the 
Trojans corresponded to the position of 
Achilles among the Greeks, fought Patro- 
clus, friend of Achilles, and slew him. 
After a period of deep melancholy, Achilles 
set forth to avenge the death of his friend, 
fought Hector, and triumphed. The poem 
ends with an account of the burial of thg 
Trojan hero. 
Such is the plot, reduced to the briefest 
compass, of the poem. Such an abstract 
does not bring in the episodes that are scat- 
tered through the Iliad, or the passages 
that reveal the manners and customs of the 
time, or the figures and descriptions that 
add beauty and stateliness to the style. 
But it does show how simple and compact 
was the plot. The poet does not give a 
history of the war—its causes, the events 
of the ten long years, the close. He 
merely seizes upon a set of events, cover- 
* ing only a few days, that are significant 
of the whole; he contrives to make us 
aware of the entire story of the war; and 
he draws his picture swiftly and compactly 
so that it stands out with unforgetable 
distinctness. 
The Odyssey has for its hero Odysseus, 
or as the Roman poets and historians 
named him, Ulysses. This hero was one 
of the Greek chieftains at Troy. After 
the war ended, he set forth for Ithaca, his 
home. But he was compelled by adverse 
fates to become a wanderer, so that it was 
many years after the fall of Troy before 
he was restored to his wife and son, The 
poem is very different from the Iliad. 
There are no battles in it. In place of 
this warlike atmosphere we have many 
marvelous events, so that the poem has 
become a treasure-house of folklore and 
legend, somewhat like the fairy stories and 
the Arabian Nights that you read years 
ago. But the plot is as wonderfully con- 
structed as that of the Iliad. There are 
three strands, or sets, of stories. The 
- first is concerned with the adventures of 
Ulysses from the time he left Troy to the 
time he was restored to his kingdom at 
Ithaca. The second tells the adventures of 
Telemachus, Ulysses’s son, who went out 
in search of his father. The third tells 
us of Penelope, the wife of the hero, who 
was besieged by many suitors who wished INTRODUCTION TO HOMER'S ODYSSEY 
to secure the property of the hero and who 
spent years as unwelcome gues‘s in his 
house. But this outline does not suffi- 
ciently show how masterly was the poet's 
handling of these strands of story. For 
one thing, the action is compressed into a 
short space by the device of having the 
hero tell to Alcinoiis, king of the Phea- 
cians, some of his marvelous adventures. 
A. little further analysis will make even 
clearer the skill with which the poet 
handles +his complicated material. 
The poem opens at Ithaca, where 
Penelope and Telemachus are awaiting 
the hero’s return. The suitors, thinking 
that Ulysses is dead, try to persuade 
Penelope to choose one of their number 
as her husband, but she refuses. They 
are so numerous and so powerful that she 
cannot drive them away. Telemachus 
is told by Athena (Minerva) to go in 
search of his father, and the story next 
relates how he went from place to place 
to find the various heroes who had seen 
his father at Troy. We then meet 
Ulysses, who has spent seven years.as a 
captive of Calypso, a beautiful enchant- 
ress, on a magic island. At last Calypso 
consents to let Ulysses go, so he builds a 
raft and on it reaches the land of the 
Phzeacians. How he is received by them 
is told in the selection that you are to 
read. He tells them of his adventures 
and at last departs for Ithaca. When he 
reaches home he finds so many enemies 
that he does not at once reveal his identity, 
but puts on the disguise of a beggar. 
Meantime Telemachus has returned, and 
father and son, reunited, plan to regain 
control of the kingdom by stratagem.

further observations for yourself. Before 
you begin the reading of the poem, how- 
ever, a little further information will help 
you. 
The epic,-as you probably have observed 
by this time, is not a primitive kind of 
poetry nor does it deal with rude and 
barbarous life. The author, or authors, 
of these two ancient Greek epics perhaps 
lived in the tenth or eleventh century 
before Christ. Very probably the material 
of the poems came from ballads and heroic 
songs that had descended through many 
generations. There are stories in the Iliad 
very like some of the ballads that you will 
find in this book, and some stories in the 
Odyssey are like certain of the folk tales 
you used to read in fairy books. . In fact, 
the Odyssey is a glorious collection of such 
tales. But they are not told in the 
language of the ballads and fairy tales, 
nor in the same manner, and they are 
woven together into a plot of the most 
exquisite design. A primitive or unedu- 
cated people could not produce such work. 
The style of the poem is stately. It 
deals with noble subjects treated in a 
noble manner.. No other form of narra- 
tive poetry, except tragic drama, is so 
elevated and serious in treatment. 
‘The same remark applies to the life that 
is depicted. It is a life of the utmost 
simplicity. Kings and princesses do work 
that many people nowadays think only 
servants. should do. But how noble is 
. this simplicity! No better lesson about 
the dignity of honest labor could be 
taught than you find in this poem. The 
occupations of the people, too, belong to a 
simple and uncomplicated civilization. 
There are no gay knights, fashionable 
ladies, great barons. There are carpenters, 
leather-workers, smiths. The women are 
spinners and weavers. There is no men- 
tion of money. A man’s wealth consisted 
in the number of oxen he owned. You 
Should add to these observations as you 
read the poem, but the important thing 
is for you to try to feel that the life rep- 
resented in the poem has attained stateli- 
ness, dignity, nobility, without losing the 
simplicity of pioneer times. It is not 
coarse or vulgar; neither is it courtly 
or affected. HOMER'S ODYSSEY 217 
Epic poetry, then, commonly finds its 
sources in ballads and hero tales that have 
been handed down by tradition for many 
years. It is a form of story. It has 
many episodes, which are woven into a 
plot that gives a unified effect. Its 
basis is historical, that is, it is-related to 
events that are felt by a people to be 
significant in the story of their develop- 
ment: some crucial war; the life-history of 
one of the nation’s founders, It therefore 
portrays not only the character of a hero 
who is felt to be truly representative of the 
national character, but the ideals of life 
that the people feel to be their ideals. 
It is not merely a story. It has stateli- 
ness and dignity and is told in an elevated 
and serious manner, but it also has the 
simplicity and: directness of a people not 
spoiled by wealth or power or an advanced 
‘civilization. 
mm 
All great peoples have ballads and epics 
that deal with their origins. In Rome the 
greatest epic was the Aeneid, written by 
Vergil in the century before the Christian 
era. This poem is also connected with 
the story of Troy, for Aeneas, the hero, was 
a Trojan chief who fled from his native 
city after its fall, wandered like Ulysses 
through many years, endured many 
hardships, and at length founded the city 
which later became mighty Rome. The 
legend of Troy was also told in epics of the 
Middle Ages, and some of the nations of 
western Europe long thought that they 
were descended from the ancient city. Eng- 
land, for example, was called Britain, and 
it was thought, though without reason, that 
this name came from Brute, or Brutus, the 
legendary founder of New Troy (London), 
who was said to have been a grandson of 
Aeneas. Several old English verse chroni- 
cles, imitating the style of the epics, told 
this story. 
The only true epic which deals with the 
real foundation of the English race, how- 
ever, is Beowulf, a poem written in Anglo- 
Saxon, the earliest form of the English 
language. This poem has a slight his- 
torical foundation, though the events with © 
which it is connected took place before the 
tribes that founded England had left
-P-A-G-E-227
218 
their Teutonic home. It relates three 
great adventures of its hero, and tells us 
something of his life from boyhood until 
‘his death. It has the dignity and stateli- 
ness required by the epic form, and the life 
led by Hrothgar, Beowulf, and Hygelac, 
the principal persons of the story, has 
much of the simplicity of greatness that 
we have already noted in the Homeric epic. 
Of the epic in other countries there ig no 
space to treat. Many sagas, or hero- 
stories, have come down to us from 
Teelandic, Norse, and old German sources. 
Some of these have been retold in modern 
verse by Arnold in “Balder Dead” and by 
William Morris in the “Earthly Paradise.” 
A mass of German legend attained epic 
form in the Middle Ages in the Nibelung- 
enlied, and some of these stories were used 
by Wagner in his operas. In France, the 
Song of Roland is the greatest of a large 
number of epic tales that grew up around 
the name of Charlemagne and his knights, 
while the-Arthurian legend, made English 
by the prose of Malory’s Morte d’ Arthur 
in the fifteenth century and Tennyson’s INTRODUCTION TO HOMERS ODYSSEY 
Idylls of the King in the nineteenth, first 
took on epic form in French poetry of the 
twelfth century. 
Later epics are imitations of the heroic 
poems that sprang from peoples just 
attaining national consciousness and a 
relatively high state of civilization. Spen- 
ser’s Faerie Queene is one of these, belong- 
ing to the end of the sixteenth century, and 
adapting some of the character of the 
Arthurian romances to an allegory of the 
founding of England, the greatness of the 
reign of Elizabeth, and the character of 
the ideal hero as conceived by the people 
of Shakespeare’s time. A century later 
John Milton wrote the epic of Paradise 
Lost, biblical rather than historical in 
theme, imitative of Vergil, but summing 
up the thought of his time in regard to 
Providence and man’s destiny. No epic 
of the founding of the United States exists, 
but Longfellow gal’ * 7 os

Now to his palace, planning the return 
Of the magnanimous Ulysses, came 
The blue-eyed goddess Pallas, entering : 
The gorgeous chamber where a damsel. slept, 
Nausicaa, daughter of the Jarge-souled king 
Alcinois, beautiful in form and face 21 
As one of the immortals. Near her lay, 
And by the portal, one on. either side,

The damsel’s head and spake. In look she 
seemed : 27 
The daughter of the. famous. mariner 
Dymas, a maiden whom Nausicaa loved, 
The playmate of her girlhood. In her shape 
The blue-eyed goddess stood, and thus she 
said: : 31

In beauty. That were seemlier than to walk, 
Since distant from the town the lavers lie.” 
‘Thus having said, the blue-eyed Pallas went 
Back to Olympus, where the gods have made, 
So saith tradition, their eternal seat. 55

By showers, and there the snow doth never

Her father, going forth to meet the chiefs 71 
Of the Pheacians in a council where 
Their noblest asked his presence. Then the 
maid, 
Approaching her beloved father, spake: 
“TI pray, dear father, give command to make 
A chariot ready for me, with high sides 16 
And sturdy wheels, to bear to the river-brink, 
There to be cleansed, the costly robes that now” 
Lie soiled. Thee likewise it doth well beseem 
At councils to appear in vestments fresh 30 
And stainless. Thou hast also in these halls 
Five sons, two wedded, three in boyhood’s 
bloom, 
And ever in the dance they need attire 
New from the wash. All this must I provide.” 
She ended, for she shrank from saying aught 
Of her own hopeful marriage. He perceived 36 
Her thought and said: “Mules I deny thee not, 
My daughter, nor aught else. Go then; my 
grooms : 
Shall make a carriage ready, with high sides 
And sturdy wheels, and a broad rack above.” 
He spake, and gave command. The grooms 
. obeyed, 91 
And, making ready in the outer court 
The strong-wheeled chariot, led the harnessed 
mules 
Under the yoke and made them fast; and then 
Appeared the maiden, bringing from her 
bower 
The shining garments. In the polished car 96 
She piled them, while with many pleasant 
meats 
And flavoring morsels for the day’s repast 
Her mother filled a hamper, and poured wine 
Into a goatskin. As her daughter climbed 
The car, she gave into her hands a cruse 101 
Of gold with smooth anointing oil for her 
And her attendant maids. Nausicaa took 
The scourge and showy reins, and struck the 
mules 
To urge them onward. Onward with loud 
noise 105 
They went, and with a speed that slackened 
not, 
And bore the robes and her—yet not alone, 
For with her went the maidens of her train.

And sat upright, discoursing to himself: 149 
“Ah me! upon what region am I thrown? 
What men are here—wild, savage, and unjust,

Such seemed Ulysses when about to meet 
Those fair-haired maidens, naked as he was, 
But forced by strong necessity. To them 171 
His look was frightful, for his limbs were foul 
With sea-foam yet. To right and left they fled 
Along the jutting river-banks. Alone 
The daughter of Alcinotis kept her place, 175 
For Pallas gave her courage and forbade 
Her limbs to tremble. So she waited there. 
Ulysses pondered whether to approach

{ Townward and give him garments. Musing 
thus, 
It seemed the best to keep at distance still, 
And use soft words, lest, should he clasp her

words 185 
Skillfully ordered thus Ulysses spake: 
“O queen, I am thy suppliant, whether thou 
Be mortal or a goddess. If perchance 
Thou art of that immortal race who dwell 
In the broad heaven, thou art, I deem, most

Beyond them all, who, bringing princely gifts,

T never looked on one of mortal race, 201 
Woman or man, like thee, and as I gaze 
I wonder. Like to thee I saw of late, 
In Delos, a young palm-tree growing up 
Beside Apollo’s altar; for I sailed 205 
To Delos, with much people following me, 
On a disastrous voyage. Long I gazed 
Upon it wonder-struck, as I am now— 
For never from the earth so fair a tree 
Had sprung. So marvel I, and am amazed 
At thee, O lady, and in awe forbear on 
To clasp thy knees. Yet much have I endured. 
It was but yestereve that I escaped 
From the black sea, upon the twentieth day, 
So long the billows and the rushing gales 215 
Farther and farther from Ogygia’s isle 
Had borne me. Now upon this shore some god 
Casts me, perchance to meet new sufferings 
here; 
For yet the end is not, and many things 
The gods must first accomplish. But do thou, 
O queen, have pity on me, since to thee 221 
I come the first of all. I do not know 
A single dweller of the land beside. 
Show me, I pray, thy city; and bestow 224 
Some poor old robe to wrap me—if, indeed,

And then the white-armed maid Nausicaa 
said: 235

My mother where she sits beside the hearth, 
Leaning against a column in its blaze, 386

Of bright. sea-purple, while her-maidens sit 
Behind her. Near her is my. father’s throne,

Thus having said, she raised the shining 
sco' 
And struck the mules, that quickly left behind 
The river. On they went with easy pace 400 
And even steps. The damsel wielded well 
The reins, and used the lash with gentle hand, 
So that Ulysses and her train of maids 
On foot could follow close. And now the sun 
Was sinking when they came to that fair grove 
Sacred to Pallas. There the noble chief 406 
Ulysses sat him down, and instantly 
Prayed to the daughter of imperial Jove: 
“O thou unconquerable child of Jove 
The Agis-bearer! hearken tome now, 410 
Since late thou wouldst not listen to my 
prayer, What time the mighty shaker of the shores 
Pursued and wrecked me! Grant me to receive 
Pity and kindness from Phseacia’s sons.” 
So prayed he, supplicating. Pallas heard 
The prayer, but came not to him openly. 416 
Awe of her father’s brother held her back; 
For he would still pursue with violent hate

Of women. The Pheacian princes here 
Were seated; here they ate and drank, and 
held

With blazing torches in their hands to light

Ulysses took into his brawny hands 
An ample veil of purple, drawing it 
Around his head to hide his noble face, 105 
Ashamed that the Phzacians should behold 
The tears that flowed so freely from his lids. 
But when the sacred bard had ceased his song,

Halius, and Clytoneius, like a god 
In aspect. Some of these began the games, 
Contending in the race. For them a course 
‘Was marked from goal to goal. They darted 
forth . 151 
At onee and swiftly, raising, as they ran, 
The dust along the plain. The swiftest there 
Was Clytoneius in the race. As far

But in the leap Amphialus was first; 160 
Elatreus flung the quoit with firmest hand; 
And in the boxer’s art Laodamas, 
The monarch’s valiant son, was.conqueror. 
This when the admiring multitude had seen, 
Thus spake the monarch’s son, Laodamas: 
“And now, my friends, inquire we of our 
guest ~ 166 
If he has learned and practiced feats-like these. 
For he is not ill-made in legs and thighs 
And in both arms, in firmly planted neck 
And strong-built frame; nor does he seem to 
lack 170 
A certain youthful vigor, though impaired 
By many hardships—for I know of naught 
That more severely tries the strongest man, 
And breaks him down, than perils of the 
sea. 
Euryalus replied: “Laodamas, 175 
Well hast thou said, and rightly; go thou now 
And speak to him thyself, and challenge him.” 
The son of King Alcinotis, as he heard, 
Came forward, and bespake Ulysses thus: 179 
“Thou also, guest and father,.try these feats, 
If thou perchance wert trained to them. I 
think « 
Thou must be skilled in games, since there’ is 
not 
A greater glory for a man while yet 
He lives on earth than what he hath wrought 
out, 184 
By strenuous effort, with his feet and hands, 
Try, then, thy skill, and give no place to grief. 
Not long will thy departure be delayed; 
Thy bark is launched; the crew are ready 
here.” 
Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus: 
““Why press me, O Laodamas! to try 190

And not of games? I, who have borne so 
much 
Of pain and toil, sit pining for my home

Then spake Euryalus with chiding words: 
“Stranger, I well perceive thou canst not 
boast, 
As many others can, of skill.in games; 
But thou art one of those who dwell in ships 
With many benches, rulers o’er a crew 200

By rapine, and art surely no athlete.” 
Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said: 
“Stranger, thou speakest not becomingly, 206 
But like a.man who recks not what he says. 
The gods bestow not equally on all 
The gifts that men desire—the grace of form, 
The mind, the eloquence. One man to sight Thau hast doubtless gathered 
Is undistinguished, but on him the gods 211 
Bestow the power of words. All look on him 
Gladly; he knows whereof he speaks; his 
speech

Tn all assemblies, and, whene’er he walks 
The city, men regard him as a god. 
Another in the form he wears is like 217 
The immortals, yet has he no power to speak 
Becoming words. So thou hast comely looks; 
A god would not have shaped thee otherwise 
Than we behold thee—yet thy wit is small, 
And thy unmannerly words have angered me 
Even to the heart. Not quite unskilled am I 
In games, as thou dost idly talk, and once, 
When I could trust my youth and my strong 
arms, 225 
I think that in these contests I was deemed 
Among the first.. But I am now pressed down 
With toil and sorrow; much have I endured 
In wars with heroes and on stormy seas. 
Yet even thus, a sufferer as I am, 230 
Will I essay these feats; for sharp have been 
Thy words and they provoke me to the proof.” 
He spake, and rising with his mantle on 
He seized a broader, thicker, heavier quoit, 
By no small odds, than the Pheacians used, 
And swinging it around with vigorous arm 
He sent it forth; it sounded as it went; 
And the Pheeacians, skillful with the oar 
And sail, bent low as o’er them, from his hand, 237 LEGEND AND HISTORY

She spake; Ulysses the great sufferer 
Heard, and rejoiced to know he had a friend 
In that great circle. With a lighter heart 251 
Thus said the chief to the Phreacian crowd: 
“Follow that cast, young men, and I will

* * * 
Alcinoiis called his sons Laodamas 
And Halius forth, and bade them dance alone, 
For none of all the others equaled them. 455 
Then taking a fair purple ball, the work

One flung it toward the shadowy clouds on high;

Is amply proved. I look and am amazed.”

He spake; they all approved, and each one 
sent 435 
His herald with a charge to bring the gifts, 
And thus Euryalus addressed the king: 
“O King Alcinoiis, mightiest of our race, 
I will obey thee, and will seek to appease 
Our guest. This sword of brass will I bestow, 
With hilt of silver, and an ivory sheath 491. 
New wrought, which he may deem a gift of

“Stranger and father, hail! If any word

Ulysses, the sagacious,. thus replied: 
“Hail also, friend! and may the gods confer 
On thee ail happiness, and may the time 
Never arrive when thou shalt miss the sword

He spake, and slung the silver-studded

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Exprianatory Notes 
1. Some translators, of the Odyssey use 
the Greek names throughout: Odysseus, Zeus, 
Hera, Pallas Athena, Poseidon, Artemis, 
Hephaestus; but Bryant in his translation pre- 
fers to use the Latin names: Ulysses, Jupiter or 
Jove, Juno, Minerva, Neptune, Diana, Vulcan. 
He gives as his reason for doing so the fact that 
Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and 
other early writers used these forms and made 
them familiar to English readers, 
2. The Odyssey was composed originally in 
the Greek language, but many translations, 
both verse and prose, have been made into the 
modern languages. Among the best-known 
translations in English are those of Bryant, 
Palmer, Butcher and Lang, Morris, Pope, and 
Chapman.

THE BALLAD 
AN INTRODUCTION 
I 
~The word “ballad” usually suggests a 
short story in verse, just as an epic may 
be thought of as a verse-novel. This is a 
very incomplete definition, however, as 
there are many short narrative poems 
which we do not call ballads. Sometimes 
the name is applied to a sentimental song, 
and it is true that a ballad is always a song. 
* If we look up the word in a dictionary we 
find that it comes from an old French word 
meaning “to dance.” At one time, there- 
fore, the ballad seems to have been a song 
for a dancing chorus. Story, song, dance— 
here are three ingredients that appear to 
be mixed up in that form of composition 
which is called a ballad. 
To name some of the ingredients, iow- 
ever, or all of them, is not to give a defini- 
tion. In “Sir Patrick Spens,”’ for example, 
the short story characteristic comes -out 
very plainly. There is an abrupt begin- 
ning, which puts you at once into possession. 
of the necessary facts: the king sitting in 
his tower, calling for a good sailor to be 
sent on a dangerous mission; the naming 
of Sir Patrick for this mission by an elderly 
knight; the commission which the king 
sent to Sir Patrick. All this is told in 
three stanzas of four lines each. The 
second part of the story, consisting of four 
stanzas, tells us the character of Sir 
Patrick: his pride in being selected, suc- 
ceeded by his realization that he is really 
being sent into a trap by an enemy; and 
this is immediately followed by the fore- 
bodings of a superstitious old: sailor who 
fears that his master is going to his death. 
Of the voyage we are told nothing; a 
single stanza suffices for the wreck for 
which we have been prepared by’ the 
previous part of the story; and the ballad 
ends with three stanzas that tell of the 
grief of the wives and sweethearts of the 
sailors, with a final stanza saying that the 
men were fifty fathoms under the sea. The similarity between the ballad plot 
and the plot of the short story is apparent. 
A single incident is related, from a single 
point of view. Nothing is told that is not 
necessary to give this effect. Indeed, the 
very things that one would expect to be 
told in detail are left to the imagination. 
We are not told why the King wished to 
send his men on such a mission, or what 
was the truth about the grudge which led 
the King’s counselor to choose Sir Patrick 
for a journey that meant death; or what 
Sir Patrick did, or the cause of the wreck. 
The main incidents seem to be suppressed. 
Rather, they stand out more significantly 
because they are merely suggested by: the 
sailor’s forebodings, the grief of the ladies, 
and the tragic simplicity of the closing 
lines. Very likely these omissions are 
due to the fact that the story was well- 
known to the audience for whom the 
ballad was composed, so that it was not 
felt to be necessary to give details. What 
the balladist wanted to do was to express 
the horror, the emotion, that those who 
knew all the details felt when they heard 
of the fate of the brave sailor ***

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BALLAD 
difference. The horror inspired by the 
tragedy of Sir Patrick Spens is like that 
of some great catastrophe in actual life:. 
the fall of a theater roof upon a happy, 
laughing audience; the sudden destruction 
wrought by a tornado. It is elemental. 
The horror inspired by Poe’s story is 
like that of a tragedy acted on the stage, 
where setting, lighting effects, speech, and 
gesture, are all -carefully designed to 
produce the effect desired. It is not that 
one method: is bad and the other good. 
It is just that the two things differ. 
Another illustration of the impersonal 
character of the ballad is even more 
striking. In the stories by O. Henry, 
for example, you are not conscious of 
taking any part in<the action. Your 
attitude is that of a listener or a spectator. 
You cannot imagine yourself a part of a 
group of men and women, all of whom are 
brought into immediate relation to the 
action. In the ballad, on the other hand, 
this feeling that the reader or listener is one. 
of such a group is present. The very fact 
that you are not told exactly what hap- 
pened implies that this was not necessary; 
you are already supposed to know these 
things. You will see it clearly if you will 
imagine that ou are one of a group of 
people who have been powerfully moved 
by the tragic fate of Sir Patrick. You 
knew him or some of his men. In this 
group the tragedy is being discussed. 
One man says he heard that Sir Patrick 
suspected the hand of an enemy, but that 
he was too brave to draw back even though 
he knew the voyage meant death. An- 
other says that an old sailor observed 
portents and omens that promised a 
tragic outcome. A third adds that such 
omens ought never to be disregarded. 
Others wonder how the wives and sweet- 
hearts of the dead sailors felt when they. 
heard the news, and they speak of the 
unutterable sadness of their waiting at 
home, day after day, for tidings. And at 
last someone speaks of the dead men 
themselves, lying down there fifty fathoms, 
under the sea; their dead eyes open, their 
bodies gently rolling from side to side 
with the motion of the water, or too far 
below the surface ever to move. You see 
you have, in reality, a succession of broken 237 
bits of talk, expressions of mood, not a 
story told in an orderly way or written up 
for the newspaper. One member of the 
group and then another adds his bit. 
There are moments of silence between. 
All are thinking of the horror, and deeply 
moved. Then perhaps one, or two, or 
three, begin to put the thing into words. 
The words fit some simple song that 
everyone knows. The group begins to 
sing the song. The ballad is born. 
Thus the ballad seems not to be a story 
at all but just the.expression of the feelings 
of a whole group of people. It differs 
from the story in that it seems to tell 
itself.’ It is not the work of an author 
who gives to the events an interpretation 
or who carefully chooses details so that a 
definite impression is built up in the mind 
of the reader. It expresses the reactions 
of a group. It is impersonal. 
_ It is a tale telling itself. 
I 
The third characteristic of the ballad 
is that it is designed to be sung. There 
is abundant evidence of this. In certain 
parts of the United States one may still 
hear some of these ballads sung to airs 
that are themselves very old. This will 
not much longer be possible. The ballad 
belongs to a way of life in which auto- 
mobiles, telephones, and victrola records 
were unknown. It cannot breathe the . 
same atmosphere with the song from a 
Broadway musical comedy, stamped on 
rubber disks and sent to every hamlet 
in the nation. 
The ballad is a form of lyric poetry. 
Like other lyrics, it may be read or recited, 
but it is best when it is sung. This is 
true not only of the traditional ballads 
that were handed down for generations 
by word of mouth before they were ever 
written or printed, but also of ballads 
that were written like any other form of 
lyric. For example, in one of Shake- 
speare’s plays a peddler comes to a country 
festival with printed ballads to sell. He 
gives a list of these, telling something 
about the story and naming the airs, or 
music, to which they are to be sung. 
Many of Burns’s lyrics are very similar 
to the ballads, and in any edition of his
-P-A-G-E-247
238 
poems you will find the names of the 
tunes. Sir Walter Scott, 
great collector, of the old folk ballads, 
named his collection The Minstrelsy of the 
Scottish- Border, thus ‘indicating the fact 
that the ballads were such as might have 
been sung by the ancient minstrels. In 
very early times, it is likely that the ballads 
were made in the presence of a group of 
: people who joined immediately, i in the very 
act of composition, in singing them. 
Perhaps, too, the singing was accompanied 
by rhythmic motion akin to the dance. 
But always the song is an essential. 
Our definition of the ballad is now com- 
plete. It is a short story in verse; it is 
told without any of the decorations of 
literary art, expressing the feeling or 
mood not of an author but of a group, 
so that it seems to tell itself; and it is 
designed to be sung, not read or recited. 
These ideas are best expressed in a, defini- 
tion that has become famous for its 
completeness: “A ballad is a tale telling 
itself in song.” 
Iv 
It remains to say something about the 
themes and the style of the ballads, and 
about the life that they reflect. 
Ballads have been made by all races 
and nations from the remotest antiquity. 
Since they represented the folk, ordinary 
people without the leisure or training to 
appreciate more carefully wrought poetry 
and prose, people who could neither read 
nor write, they were not written on 
paper or parchment but handed down 
orally from one generation to another. 
The epic poet might use stories that had 
long been known in ballad form, but he 
changed them, added reflections of his 
own, gave them poetic figures, and sup- 
plied material to fill in gaps in the narra- 
tive, so that: the original ballad was 
transformed. It follows that only a few 
ballads have been preserved by any 
nation in proportion to the vast number 
that have been made. Indeed, educated 
men did not take much interest in this 
poetry of the common people until com- 
paratively recent times. Toward the end 
of the eighteenth century, Bishop Percy 
made a collection of old. ballads and ro- who. was a AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BALLAD 
mances that he called Reliques of English 
Poetry. About the same time, Robert 
Burns and other poets took advantage of 
the growing interest in old Scottish tunes 
by writing new lyrics, some of them ballads, 
to be sung to these tunes. A little later 
Sir Walter Scott published his great col- 
lection called the M: instrelsy of the Scottish 
* Border. 
This growing interest in the ballads led 
to more careful study of them and to a 
search for others that had not yet been 
written down. This study, brought forth 
many versions of some of the ballads, 
certain of these versions being found in 
America. In all cases the ballad is taken 
down orally by someone who is fortunate 
enough to hear it sung. Generally a folk 
ballad can now be found only in some 
remote region little affected by civilization 
and in which the present inhabitants can 
trace their descent to pure old English 
or Scottish stock. 
The themes of the ballads are varied. 
Some deal with the wars of the clans on 
the Scottish border and with other heroic 
matters, such as single combats between 
rival chiefs or the death of a hero. Many 
are romantic, telling of star-crossed lovers, 
or of a maid wooed by a lord in the dis- 
guise of a beggar, or the supplanting of a 
maiden by a rival. Some deal with the 
supernatural: a lover’s ghost returns to 
claim the bride, or a mother is visited 
by the ghosts of her sons, or a fairy claims 
a mortal lover. A few are humorous, but 
not many; the outlook on life that we 
find in the ballads is usually tragic. They 
deal with elemental themes: love, death, 
friendship, deadly enmity. Even the 
supernatural is treated in the same realistic 
manner. The ballad does not try to per- 
suade you that there may be ghosts; it 
takes ghosts, fairies, supernatural crea- 
tures for granted. This is why, in the 
ballad about the wife of Usher’s Well, you 
will find no attempt to make the flesh 
creep, to inspire terror of the unknown 
world, as in Shakespeare’s account of 
Hamlet’s father’s ghost or in some of 
Poe’s tales of the supernatural. You are 
not even told that these visitors are 
ghosts; it is taken for granted. 
From all this it will appear also that
-P-A-G-E-248
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BALLAD 
the ballad gives little analysis of character. 
We are not given details as to what the 
persons of the ballad are thinking about. 
The traits of character are simple: the 
man is brave, or a coward, or the sport 
of fate. The king is a king because he 
can sit in his tower and drink blood-red 
wine; the ladies are recognized as ladies 
because they have gold combs in their 
hair. Most of the ballads are intensely 
realistic. The richly described knights 
and ladies of the romances are not. met 
here. Lovers do not woo in courtly 
language or sigh or write poetry, though 
they may die of a broken heart. The 
virtues are simple: faith, loyalty, courage, 
true friendship. 
Something has already been said about 
ballad-style: the absence of detail, of 
decoration, of any of the devices that we 
call literary. Since the ballad is to be 
sung to a simple tune, there are no com- 
plicated stanza-forms. Usually a four- 
line stanza in which the second and fourth 
lines rime, with four accents in the first 
and third lines and three in the sec- 
ond and fourth, is characteristic. Certain 
phrases are used over and over and be- 
come conventions of ballad style. These 
will be pointed out in the notes. The 
most striking characteristic of ballad style 
is what has been called “incremental 
repetition,” by which is meant the repeti- 
tion of a line with just a little addition or 
increment to the story. Good illustra- 
tions will be found in “Lord Randal.” 
Apparently the lines say the same thing 
over and over, but you will notice that the 
variations, though slight, are sufficient to 
carry forward the story, so that at the end 
the entire situation is plain. 239 
Tilustrations of the principal kinds of 
folk ballads are included in the pages you. 
are now to réad. -The first four selections 
are of the simplest, most primitive, type. 
In these you will be able to find illustra- 
tions of the different characteristics of the 
folk ballad that have been pointed out. 
This group is followed by three ballads of 
the heroic type; and these in turn by two 
romantic ballads. Three ballads. dealing 
with the supernatural, the world of the 
dead or of the fairies, are next given, and 
an excellent humorous ballad completes 
the group. 
In reading these ballads do not be 
alarmed by the seeming strangeness of 
the language. It is the language of the 
people, not a literary language. Difficult 
words are explained in the notes, but 
many words seem strange merely because 
of the spelling. If you will read the 
stanza aloud, the sound of the word will 
often give you the meaning. Only by 
reading aloud do you get the spirit of the 
ballad: its vigor, its simplicity, its rapidity 
of movement. And if you should be so 
fortunate as to be able to hear some of 
these old songs of the people sung to their 
ancient music, you will learn more about 
the ballad spirit than through any amount 
of study. 
Since the great revival of interest in the 
ballads began, many writers have tried to 
imitate this form of poetry. You will 
find, beginning on page 259, a group of 
selections from these literary ballads. It 
will be interesting for you to point out the 
various likenesses and. differences between 
these modern imitations of the ballad and 
the songs of the unlettered folks of long 
ago. :

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This ballad is an excellent illustration of 
the way in which repetition of words and phrases 
may be used to advance the ballad-story. This 
kind of repetition (“incremental repetition”) 
has already been explained on page 239.. Study 
it here by the following outline: (a) Point out 
in each stanza the mother’s question and the 
son’s answer, omitting the refrain and the 
repeated words. (b) Does each question Jead
-P-A-G-E-250
  THE TWA SISTERS 
naturally to the next following question? 
{c) How much of each stanza is repetition or 
refrain? (d) -If someone suggested the ques- 
tion, could you make the rest of the stanza, or 
sing it if you knew the tune, without paying 
further attention to the composition? (e) Does 
the refrain in the fourth line of each stanza 
ever vary? If so, why, and what effect is 
gained? Is the refrain merely a set of re- 
peated words, or does it help the story in any 
way? 
2. The “legacy” is a convention, or com- 
monplace, in many ballads. What change in 
the structure of the stanzas marks the intro- 
duction of this convention here? What persons 
are named? Of these, only one is important. 
Which one, and why? What, then, is the 
“increment,” or addition to the story, that this 
set of repetitions contributes? 
8, Reconstruct the story of the ballad, in- 
cluding both what you are told in the poem and 
what you know must have happened. How do 
you know that these things, not definitely 
mentioned, must have happened? Underline 
the parts of the story that are thus taken for 
granted, not definitely stated. About what 
proportion of the whole story is told in this 
indirect way? 
4, In what way does this ballad resemble 
ashort story? How does it differ? 
THE TWA SISTERS 
There was twa sisters in a bowr,

But he lovd the youngest above a’ thing. 
He courted theeldest wi brotch anknife, 10 
But lovd the youngest, as his life.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Stuty the repetition and refrain. Which 
lines in the complete stanza carry on the story? 
Which lines are purely refrain, with no relation 
to the story? Which line in each stanza is 
repeated three times? What is the effect? 
What use of repetition, binding stanzas to- 
gether, do you discover in the lines which 
carry the story from stanza to stanza? 
2. Write out, or be prepared to tell to the 
class, the story of the ballad. ‘What facts in 
this story are not given directly but are left 
to’ be supplied by the reader or hearer? What 
descriptive elements, such as the description of 
the heroine, are repeated? Are there any 
conventional expressions for describing her 
hands, her jewels, etc.? 
8. Note that the song of the harper is a 
variant of the “legacy”. theme met in “Lord 
Randal.” Why does the harp play this tune?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1, Note that the second and fourth lines, 
constituting the refrain, are printed only in the 
first stanza. If you were to sing the ballad, of 
course you would include this refrain in each 
stanza. How does it differ from the refrain in 
“Lord Randal”? Does it add to the story,
-P-A-G-E-252
BONNY BARBARA. ALLAN 
or to the setting, or to the mood of the ballad 
in any way? 
2. Omitting the refrain, what other repeti- 
tions are there in this ballad? Make a study 
of these in the following way: (a) How many 
persons are present? What part does each 
play in the action? (b) If you have heard the 
part of the ballad dealing with the first sister, 
can you make the part referring to the second? 
To the third? (c) What “increment,” or 
addition, then, do you find? How does it 
help tell the story? (d) Why are there no 
repetitions in the last five stanzas? 
8. Reconstruct the story in your own words, 
just as you did in studymg “Lord Randal.” 
Underline, or point out to the class, the facts 
in the complete story that are not told directly 
by the ballad. How do you know these things . 
happened?. How much of the real story hap- 
pened before the ballad-action begins? 
4, Is there any description of character in 
this ballad? How does the third sister differ 
from the first two? Do you recall any similar 
instances in other poems? 
BONNY BARBARA ALLAN 
It was in and about the Martinmas time, 
‘When the green leaves were a falling, 
That Sir John Greeme, in the West Country, 
Fell in love with Barbara Allan 4 
He sent his man down through the town, 
To the place where she was dwelling: 
“O haste and come to my master dear, 
Gin-ye be Barbara Allan.” 
0 hooly, hooly rose she up, 
To the place where he was lying, 10 
And when she drew the curtain by, 
“Young man, I think you’re dying.” 
“O it’s I’m sick, and very, very sick, 
And ’tis a’ for Barbara Allan”; 
“O the better for me ye’s never be, 15 
Tho your heart’s blood were a spill- 
ing. 
“O dinna ye mind, young man,” said she, 
“When ye was in the tavern a-drinking, 
That ye made the healths gae round and 
round, 
And slighted Barbara Allan?” 20 
8. gin, if. 9. hooly, slowly. 243 
He turnd his face unto the wall, 
And death was with him dealing: 
“Adieu, adieu, my dear friends all, 
And be kind to Barbara Allan.” 
And slowly, slowly raise she up, 25 
And slowly, slowly left him, 
And sighing said she could not stay, 
Since death of life had reft him. 
She had not gane.a mile but twa, 29 
When she heard the dead-bell ringing, 
And every jow that the dead-bell geid, 
It cry’d, “Woe to Barbara Allan!” 
“Oo mother, mother, make my bed! 
O make it saft and narrow! 
Since my love died for me today, * 85 
Tl die for him tomorrow.”

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Oliver Goldsmith, a great English poet, 
speaks of the time when an “old dairy maid 
sang me to tears with the cruelty of Barbara 
Allan.” This was a boyhood memory, and 
he says that no music that he heard in after 
life ever seemed half so fine. The incident 
illustrates not only the power of the ballads 
as sung to their original music, but also the 
way in which these old songs were handed 
down from generation to generation before 
anyone ever thought of printing them. You 
‘might try to find the music to which “Barbara 
Allan” has always been sung. 
2. Note the musical quality of the name 
“Barbara Allan” and the effect of the eonstant

He chose the Gordons and the Gremes, 
With them the Lindesays, light and gay; 
But the Jardines wald not with him ride, 
And they rue it to this day. 
And he has burn’d the dales of Tyne, 
And part of Bambroughshire; 10 
And three good towers on Reidswire fells, 
He left them all on fire, 
And he march’d up,to Newcastle, 
And rode it round about; 
“© wha’s the lord of this castle, 15 
Or wha’s the lady o’t?” 
But up spake proud Lord Percy then, 
And O but he spake hie! 
“T am the lord of this castle, 
My wife’s the lady gay.” 20 
“Tf thou’rt the lord of this castle, 
Sae weel it pleases me! 
For, ere I cross the Border fells, 
The tane of us shall die.” 
He took a lang spear in his hand, 25 
Shod with the metal free, 
And for to meet the Douglas there, 
He rode right furiouslie. 
But O how pale his lady look’d,

She saw proud Percy fa’.

“Thither will I come,” proud Percy said, 
“By the might of Our Ladye!” 
“There will I bide thee,” said the Douglas; 
“My troth I plight to thee.” 56 
They lighted high on Otterbourne, 
Upon the bent sae brown; ” 
They lighted high on Otterbourne, 
And threw their pallions down. 60 
And he that had a bonnie boy, 
Sent out his horse to grass; 
And he that had not a bonnie boy, 
His ain servant he was. 
But up then spake a little page, 65 
Before the peep of dawn, 
“O waken ye, waken ye, my good lord, 
For Percy’s hard at hand.” 
“Ye lie, ye lie, ye liar loud! 
Sae loud I hear ye lie; 70 
For Percy had not men yestreen

“But I have dream’d a dreary dream,

“My nephew good,” the Douglas said, 
“What recks the death of ane! 
Last night I dream’d a dreary dream, 95 
And I ken the day’s thy ain. 
“My wound is deep; I fain would sleep; 
Take thou the vanguard of the three, 
And hide me by the braken bush, 
That grows on yonder lilye lee. 100 
“O bury me by the braken bush, 
Beneath the blooming brier, 
Let never living mortal ken 
That ere a kindly Scot lies here.’’ 
He lifted up that noble lord, 105 
Wi’ the saut tear in his ee; 
He hid him in the braken bush, 
That his merrie-men might not see. 
The moon was clear, the day drew near, 
The spears in flinders flew, 110 
- But mony a gallant Englishmen 
Ere day the Scotsmen slew. 
The Gordons good, in English blood 
They steep’d their hose and shoon; 
The Lindsays flew like fire about 115 
Till all the fray was done. 
The Percy and Montgomery met, 
‘That either of other were fain; 
They swapped swords, and they twa swat, 
And aye the blood ran down between. 
“Now yield thee, yield thee, Percy,” he 
said, 121 
“Or else I vow I'll lay thee low!” 
“To whom must I yield,” quoth Earl Percy, 
Now that I see it must be so?” 
“Thou shalt not yield to lord nor loun, 
Nor yet shalt thou yield to me; 126 
But yield thee to the braken bush, 
That grows upon yon lilye lee.” 
“TJ will not yield to a braken bush, 
Nor yet will I yield to a brier; 130 
But I would yield to Earl Douglas,

As soon as he knew it was Montgomery,

And quickly took him by the honde. 
This deed was done at the Otterbourne, 
About the breaking of the day; 
Earl Douglas was buried at the braken

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Describe the characteristic Border raid 
that is the cause of the Battle of Otterbourne. 
Who starts the trouble—the Scottish Douglas 
or the English Percy? 
2. Is the story told from the Scottish point 
of view or that of the English? 
3. Why does Percy tell the Douglas to wait 
for him “‘three dayis” at Otterbourne? 
4. Describe the fulfillment of the Douglas’s 
dream, 
“T saw a dead man win a fight, 
And I think that man was I.” 
5. Note that in the description of Lady 
Perey, when she saw Lord Percy fall, we are 
told not how she felt but how she looked. 
Find other cases in which the external appear- 
ances of things are given instead of feelings or 
abstract ideas; how are we told, for instance, 
that the Battle of Otterbourne was fought at 
night? 6. Point out examples of vigorous verbs of 
action, Note passages where the meter is 
rough, as if the story were more important 
than the versification. This poem contains 
many examples of characteristic ballad allitera- 
tion; point out a few. 
7. This ballad, and the two ‘that follow it, 
will introduce you to the heroic type of ballad. 
All three deal with conflicts between Scottish 
and English warriors near the border between 
the two countries. What differences do you 
note between this ballad and those previously 
read? Does it resemble the epic in any respects? 
BEWICK AND GRAHAME 
Old Grahame he is to Carlisle gone, 
Where Sir Robert Bewick there met he; 
In arms to the wine they are gone, 
And drank till they were both merry.
-P-A-G-E-255
Old Grahame he took up the cup, 5 
And said, “Brother Bewick, here’s ‘to 
thee; 
And here’s to our two sons at home, 
For they live best in our country.” 
“Nay, were thy son as good as mine, — 9 
And of some books he could but read, 
With sword and buckler by his side, 
To see how he could save his head, 
“They might have been calld two bold 
brethren 
Wher ever they did go or ride; 
They might have been calld two bold 
brethren, 15 
They might have crackd the Borderside. 
“Thy son is bad, and is but a lad, 
And bully to my son cannot be; 
For miy son Bewick can both write and 
read, : 
And sure I am that cannot he.” 20 
“TI put him to school, but he would not 
Jearn, 
' I bought him books, but he would not 
read; 
But my blessing he’s never have 
Till I see how his hand can save his 
head.” 
Old Grahame called for an account, 25 
And he askd what was for to pay; 
There he paid a crown, so.it went round, 
Which was all for good wine and hay. 
Old Grahame is into the stable gone, 
_ Where stood thirty good steeds and 
three; 30 
He’s taken his own steed by the head, 
And home rode he right wantonly. 
When he came home, there did he espy, 
A loving sight to spy or see, 
There did he espy his own three sons, 35

“What’s that thou sayst, thou limmer loon? 
Or how dare thou stand to speak to me?

Christy stoopd low unto the ground, 61 
Unto the ground, as you'll understand: 
“O father, put on your glove again,

“O give me your blessing, father,” he said, 
“And pray well for me for to thrive; 
If it be my fortune my bully to kill, 
I swear I’ll neer come home alive.” 
He put on his back a good plate-jack, 
And on his head a cap of steel, 86 
With sword and buckler by his side; 
O gin he did not become them well! 
“O fare thee well, my father dear! 
And fare thee well, thou Carlisle town! 90 
If it be my fortune my bully to kill, 
I swear I'll neer eat bread again.” 
Now we'll leave talking of Christy 
Grahame, 
And talk of him again belive; 
But we will talk of bonny Bewick, 95 
Where he was teaching his scholars five. 
Now when he had learned them well to 
fence, ~ 
To handle their swords without any 
doubt, 
He’s taken his own sword under his arm, 
And walkd his father’s close about. 100 
He lookd between him and the sun, 
To see what farleys he could see; 
There he spy’d a man with armor on, 
As he came riding over the lee. 
“I wonder much what man yon be 
That so beldly this way does come; 
I think it is my nighest friend, 
I think it is my bully Grahame. 105 
«0 welcome, O welcome, bully Grahame! 
O man, thou art my dear, welcome! 110

For I love thee best in Christendom.” 
“Away, away, O bully Bewick, 
And of thy bullyship let me be!

Bully, I’m come here to fight with thee.” 
“O no! not so, O bully Grahame!

“Thou art of my mind then, bully Bewick, 
And sworn-brethren will we be; 146 
If thou be a man, as I trow thou art, 
Come over this ditch and fight with me.” 
He flang his cloak from off his shoulders; 
His psalm-book out of his hand flang he; 
He clapt his hand upon the hedge, 181 
And oer lap he right wantonly. 
When Grahame did see his bully come, 
The salt tear stood long in his eye: 
“Now needs must I say that thou art a 
man, 155 
That dare venture thy body to fight 
with me.

He flang his jack from off his back; 
His steel cap from his head flang he; 
He’s taken his sword into his hand; 
He’s tyed his horse unto a tree. 
Now they fell to it with two broad swords; 
For two long hours fought Bewick and 
he; 166 
Much sweat was to be seen on them both, 
But never a drop of blood to see. 
Now Grahame gave Bewick an ackward 
stroke, 
An ackward stroke surely struck he; 170 
He struck him now under the left breast; 
Then down to the ground as dead fell he. 
“Arise, arise, O bully Bewick, 
Arise, and speak three words to me! 
Whether this be thy deadly wound, 175 
Or God and good surgeons will mend thee.” 
“O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, 
And pray do get thee far from me! . 
Thy sword is sharp, it hath wounded my 
heart, 161 
And so no further can I gae. 
“O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, 
And get thee far from me with speed! 
And get thee out of this country quite! 
That none may know who’s done the 
deed.” 
“O if this be true, my bully dear, 
The words that thou dost tell to me, 
The vow I made, and the vow I'll keep; 
I swear I’ll be the first that die.” 
Then he stuck his sword in a moody-hill, 
Where he lap thirty good foot and three; 
First he bequeathed his soul to God, 191 
And upon his own sword-point lap he. 
Now Grahame he was the first that died, 
And then came Robin Bewick to see; 
“Arise, arise, O son!” he said, 195 
“For I see thou’s won the vietory. 180 
185 
“Arise, arise, O son!” he said,

“Nay, dig a grave both low and wide,

Now we'll leave talking of. these two 
brethren, . 205 
In Carlisle town where they lie slain, 
And talk of these two good old men, 
‘Where they were making a pitiful moan. 
With that bespoke now Robin Bewick: 
“O man, was I not much to blame? 210 
T have lost one of the liveliest lads 
That ever was bred unitd my name.” 
With that bespoke my good lord Grahame: 
“O man, I have lost the better block; 
T have lost my comfort and my joy, 215 
I have lost my key, I have lost my lock. 
“Had I gone through all Ladderdale, 
And forty horse had set on me, 
Had Christy Grahame been at my back, 
So well as he woud guarded me.” 220 
I have no more of my song to sing, 
But two or three words to you I'll name; 
But ’twill be talk’d in Carlisle town 
That these two old men were all the 
blame.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1, Divide this ballad into scenes as if for 
dramatization; tell the setting of each scene 
and the characters that take part in it. 
2. What is the cause of the fathers’ quarrel?

arms, or “blood-brothers,” and that each, 
therefore, is bound by oath to protect the other, 
to avenge his death, and not to survive him. 
Young Christy Grahame is thus forced to 
choose between fighting his blood-brother or 
his own father. What does he do? 
4. Decide who is speaking in each stanza 
from lines 105-148. What do lines 165-168 
show about the fighting quality of the two 
friends? What is young Bewick’s attitude 
toward his slayer, as shown in lines 177-184? 
5. Do you recall other instances in litera- 
ture of the blood-brother relationship? 
6. Judging from this ballad, what qualities 
were considered most admirable in a man?

Was married to a lord under night. 4

“And hold my steed in your hand, 
Until that against your seven brethren

And your father, I mak a stand.” 20 
She held his steed in her milk-white hand, 
And never shed one tear, 
Until that she saw her seven brethren fa, 
And her father hard fighting, who lov’d 
her so dear. 
“O hold your hand, Lord William!” she 
said, 25 
“For your strokes they are wondrous

But a father I can never get mair.” 
O she’s taen out her handkerchief, 
It was o the holland sae fine, 30

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. “King Estmere” and “Young Bicham” 
are illustrations of ‘ballads in which the chief 
interest is in the romance that they tell rather 
than in heroic action. To a certain extent 
this is also true of the “Douglas Tragedy.” 
In “King Estmere” there is no tragedy, for we 
feel that the Spanish king and his men got only 
what they deserved, While the balladist, as 253 
‘always, is interested chielly in events and not in 
character, you are able in this ballad to tell 
something about the heroine, the hero, thé 
girl’s father, and the unpopular suitor. You 
can also. distinguish between the lover and 
his brother. Pick out the words and phrases 
that give you information on these points. 
2. Note the spirit and zest with which the 
story is told. Point out the successive steps 
in the development of the plot. In what 
scenes do you see or make a picture of what 
is happening? 
8. Point out examples of conventional ballad 
words and phrases. 
4. Are there any instances of humor in this 
ballad? Is humor frequently found in ballads? 
5. Note that the return of the lover dis- 
guised as a harper and the battle in the hall 
in which the unwelcome suitor is killed are ° 
details closely similar to the story of Ulysses’s 
return to his home and his battle with the 
suitors of Penelope. Observe also the intro- 
duction of. “gramarye,” or magic. 
6. Some details of social life and customs 
may be noted, as for example driving the horse 
into the great hall. Why does the King of 
Spain object? Find ‘other passages which 
reflect the manners of the time. 
YOUNG BICHAM 
In London city was Bicham born, 
He longd strange countries for to see, 
But he was taen by a savage Moor, 
Who handid him right cruely. 
For thro his shoulder he put a bore, 5 
And ‘thro the bore has pitten a tree, 
An he’s gard him draw the carts o wine, 
Where horse and oxen had wont to be. 
He’s casten him in a dungeon deep, 
Where he coud neither hear nor see; 10 
He’s shut him up in a prison strong, 
An he’s handld him right cruely.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This ballad introduces a group in which 
the supernatural plays apart. Here it is a 
version of a theme very popular in folklore in 
which a mortal lover woos a fairy. Such 
legends give various ways in which a mortal 
may win access to. the world of enchantment; 
sometimes he crosses a bridge, or is ferried 
across. a stream in a boat that moves without 
cars or sails. Often he meets a strange being, 
as here. 
2. Describe the “wee, wee man.” Com-— 
pare the use of the fairy element in this ballad 
with its use in A Midsummer Night's Dream (in 
Junior High School Literature Book IT). 
8. In line 20 the “lady fine” is a fairy. 
How do you know? The story is obviously 
incomplete. What do you suppose happened?

GET UP AND BAR THE DOOR 
It fell about the Martinmass, 
When nights are lang and mirk, 
The carlin wife’s three sons came hame, 
And their hats were o the birk. 20 
It neither grew in syke nor ditch, 
Nor yet in ony sheugh; 
But at the gates o Paradise, 
That birk grew fair eneugh. 
“Blow up the fire, my maidens, 25 
Bring.water from the well; 
For a’ my house shall feast this night, 
Since my three sons are well.” 
And she has made to them a bed, 
She’s made it large and wide, 
And she’s taen her mantle her about, 
Sat down at the bed-side. 
Up then crew the red, red cock, 
And up and crew the gray; 
The eldest to the youngest said, 
“Tis time we were away.” 35 
The cock he hadna crawd but once, 
And clappd his wings at a’, 
When the youngest to the eldest said, 
“Brother, we must awa. _ 40

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Is the form of this ballad like that of any 
other you have read? Is the story like any 
other story that you have read? 
2. This ballad recites the strange experi- 
ence of a peasant woman. Can you think 
of any reason why many of the old ballads 
which have come down to us are stories of 
kings and queens, or powerful knights and 
nobles? 
8. What tidings came to this woman? 
Notice that we are told nothing of the woman’s 257 
grief; was the ballad maker intent upon some- 
thing more amazing than sorrow for the dead? 
What. is the occurrence to which everything 
else in the ballad is subordinated? 
4. How do we learn that the three sons 
did not return “in earthly flesh and blood’? 
Does the mother realize this or not? Does 
anything in the story tell you? 
5. Of what is the crowing of the cock a 
sign? During what hours did popular super- 
stition hold that spirits and elves had power? 
6. Note that the ghosts are taken as a 
matter of course. There is no attempt to 
arouse a feeling of horror in the reader or 
hearer. Compare this attitude toward the 
supernatural or the weird with that found

GET UP AND BAR THE DOOR 
It fell about the Martinmas time, 
And a gay time it was than, 
That our gudewife had puddings to mak” 
And she boil’d them in the pan. 
The wind blew cauld frae east and north 
And blew intil the floor; 6 
Quoth our gudeman to our gudewife, 
“Get up and bar the door.” 
“My hand is in my hussyskep, 
Gudeman, as ye may see; 10 
An it shou’dna, be barr’d this hunder year, 
It’s ne’er be barr’d by me.” 
They made a paction ’tween them twa, 
They made it firm and sure, 
That the first word whaever spak, 
Should rise and bar the door. 
Than by there came twa gentlemen, 
At twelve o’clock at night, 
Whan they can see na ither house, 
And at the door they light. 20 
“Now whether is this a rich man’s house, 
Or whether it is a poor?” 
But ne’er a word wad ane o’ them speak, 
For barring of the door.

And first they ate the white puddings, 
And syne they ate the black; 26 
Muckle thought the gudewife to hersell, 
Yet ne’er a word she spak. 
Then ane unto the ither said, 
“Here, man tak ye my knife; 30 
Do ye tak off the auld man’s beard, 
- And T’ll kiss the gudewife.” 
“But there’s na water in the house, 
. And what shall we do than?” 
“What ails ye at the pudding bree 35 
That boils into the pan?” 
O up then started our gudeman,

“Will ye kiss my wife before my een, 
And scaud me wi’ pudding bree?” —40 LEGEND AND HISTORY

It is an ancient Mariner, 
And he stoppeth one of three. 
“By thy long gray beard and glit- , 
tering eye, 
Now wherefore stopp’st thou me? 
IL 
The Bridegroom’s doors are opened 
wide, : 
And I am next of kin; 
The guests are met, the feast is set-— 
May’st hear the merry din.”

He holds him with his skinny hand, 
“There was a ship,” quoth he. 
“Hold off! unhand me, graybeard 
- loon!” 
* Eftsoons his hand dropt he. 
Iv 
He holds him with his glittering eye; 
_ The Wedding-Guest stood still, 
And listens like a three years’ 
child— 
The Mariner hath his will. 
v 
The Wedding-Guest sat ona stone— 
He cannot choose but hear; 
And thus spake on that ancient man, 
The bright-eyed Mariner. 
VI 
“The ship was cheered, the harbor 
cleared; 
Merrily did we drop 
Below the kirk, below the hill, 
Below the lighthouse top. 
VIL 
The Sun came up upon the left; 
Out of the sea came he! And he shone bright, and on the 
right 
Went down into the sea. 
VI . 
Higher and higher every day, 
Till over the mast at noon—” 
The Wedding-Guest here beat his 
breast, . . 
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The bride hath paced into the hall; 
Red as 2 rose is she; 
Nodding their heads before her goes 
The merry minstrelsy. : 
x 
The Wedding-Guest he beat his 
breast, 
Yet he cannot choose but hear; 
And thus spake on that ancient man, 
The bright-eyed Mariner.

“And now the Storm-Blast came, 
and he 
‘Was tyrannous and strong; 
He struck with his o’ertaking wings, 
And chased us south along. 
XII 
With sloping masts and dipping 
prow, 
As who pursued with yell and 
blow 
Still treads the shadow of his foe, 
- And forward bends his head, 
The ship drove fast, loud roared 
the blast, 
And southward aye we fled.

And now there came both mist and

And it grew wondrous cold; 
And ice, mast-high, came floating by 
As green as emerald.

The ice was all around; 
It cracked and growled, and roared

Thorough the fog it came; 
As if it had been a Christian soul,

CXXIV 
The boat came closer to the ship, 
But I nor spake nor stirred; 
The boat came close beneath the 
ship, 
And straight a sound was heard. 
CXXV 
Under the water it rumbled on, 
Still louder and more dread; 
It reached the ship, it split the bay; 
The ship went down like lead. 
CXXVI 
Stunned by that loud and dreadful 
sound, 
Which sky and ocean smote, 
Like one that hath been seven days 
drowned. 
My body lay afloat; 
But swift as dreams, myself I found 
Within the Pilot’s boat. 
CXXVII 
Upon the whirl, where sank the 
ship, The boat spun round and round; 
And all was still, save that the hill 
Was telling of the sound. 
CXXVIII 
I moved my lips—the_ Pilot 
shrieked. 
And fell down in a fit; 
The holy Hermit raised his eyes 
And prayed where he did sit. 
CXXTX 
I took the oars; the Pilot’s boy, 
Who now doth crazy go, 
Laughed loud and long, and all the 
while 
His eyes went to and fro. 
‘Ha! ha!’ quoth he, ‘full plain I see, 
The Devil knows how to row.’ 
CXxXxX 
And now, all in my own countree, 
I stood on the firm land! 
The Hermit stepped forth from the 
boat, 
And scarcely he could stand. CXXXI 
‘O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy 
man! 
The Hermit crossed his brow. 
‘Say quick,’ quoth he, I bid thee 
say— 
What manner of man art thou?’ 
CXXXiII 
Forthwith this frame of mine was 
wrenched. 
With a woeful agony, 
Which forced me to begin my tale; 
And then it left me free.

Since then, at an uncertain hour, 
That agony returns; 
And till my ghastly tale is told, 
This heart within me burns.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Norss 
1. “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” 
was Coleridge’s chief contribution to a small 
volume of poems, called Lyrical Ballads, which 
he and Wordsworth published in 1798. Both 
poets, who were great friends, believed that 
poetry should be simple in language, sincere in 
expression, free from conventional words and 
phrases, and drawn from the experience and 
feelings of ordinary men. They were fond of 
talking with peasants and using their language. 
They were also passionately devoted to Nature, 
and loved to write poetry about flowers, ani- 
mals, natural scenery, and the lives of men 
and women who lived in the country, not the 
city. They saw the beauty in Nature, and 
they liked tales of wonder and magic. In these 
respects they were much like Burns, whom 
they greatly admired. The Lyrical Ballads 
were illustrations of these beliefs about poetry. 
Not all the poems were ballads in the strict 
sense; they used the word to apply to any 
simple, song-like poem. The new poems were 
attacked by the critics, who preferred the 
poetry of city life, full of classical allusions 
and written in a rather stilted, conventional 
style that had been popular for more that a 
century, 
2. Some idea of the book may be gained 
from the fact that in it Wordsworth set him- 
self to contribute poems in which the natural, 
as he put it, should seem supernatural, while 
Coleridge was to write poems in which the 
supernatural should seem natural. That is, Wordsworth was to show the magic and mys- 
tery in common things, such as flowers and 
the simple aspects of Nature; while his friend 
was to show how a poem containing super- 
natural elements, like “The Rime of the An- 
cient Mariner,” might be so treated as to make 
these things seem real. , 
3. Coleridge, while one of the greatest 
English poets, left very few completed poems. 
He was 2 man of marvelous genius, who could 
do so many things that he was continually 
turning from one kind of activity to another. 
His whole life was a succession of brilliant 
experiments. He was a journalist, a scholar, 
a philosopher, a great critic, a lecturer, and 
a poet. When a mere boy at Christ’s Hospital 
School, he translated from Greek poetry, read 
everything he could get hold of, and astonished 
his teachers and fellow pupils by the brilliance 
of his mind. He was a great dreamer, often 
imagining that he was living the life of some 
old hero or undergoing marvelous adventures. 
Once he was walking along a street, completely 
forgetful of his surroundings, when he happened 
to run against a gentleman who promptly had 
him arrested as a pickpocket. Coleridge ex- 
plained that he was not conscious of what he 
was doing, since he thought he was Leander, 
an old Greek hero who swam across the Hel- 
lespont to visit his sweetheart Hero, and he not 
only convinced the gentleman who had com- 
plained of him, but got from him a ticket of 
admission to a subscription library. Coleridge 
tells us that he went to this library and read 
every book in it. He acquired a taste for
-P-A-G-E-279
270 
medicine, and committed to memory a Latin 
medical dictionary. He was a great student 
of philosophy, even as a boy, and read books 
that few older men are acquainted with now. 
He became interested in a shoemaker, and 
came near entering that trade. 
4. At Cambridge, where Coleridge went for 
his university training, he excelled in the 
classics but did not complete his course. At 
one time he ran away and joined the army 
under the name of Silas Tomkyn Cumberback. 
He was a wretched horseman, but got on well 
with the men because he helped them with 
their love letters. By accident it was found 
out that he was a classical scholar, and from 
this his officers found that he had run away 
from Cambridge, so he was discharged from 
the army and returned to college. He was 
greatly interested in human liberty and wrote 
about the French Revolution. With several 
friends he planned to go to America and set up 
an ideal community on the banks of the Susque- 
hanna. There was to be no private property; 
each member of the colony was to work for two 
hours a day in the garden or on the farm; the 
rest of the time was to be spent in conversation 
and study. This plan was never carried out, 
partly because Coleridge became intimate with 
Lamb and Wordsworth, and wrote a number 
of poems, which included, besides the “Ancient 
Mariner,” “Christabel” and “Kubla Khan.” 
His fondness for dreaming, his out-of-the-way 
learning, his love of romance, and his wonder- 
ful genius combined to make these three poems 
unique in English literature. 
5. The facts brought out in the preceding 
paragraphs will help you to understand the 
“Ancient Mariner”; its mystery, its marvelous: 
verse, its seeming reality in spite of the super- 
natural elements that it contains. The sug- 
gestion of the poem came from a dream of a 
skeleton ship which he learned from a friend. 
To this Wordsworth contributed a story about 
an albatross that he had read in a book of 
travels. A few lines of the poem were written 
by. Wordsworth, and at first the two friends 
planned to write the entire poem together. 
This plan was soon given up, however, and the 
poem expresses Coleridge’s own brilliant im- 
agination uncolored by any considerable in- 
fluence of his friend. 
6, The theme of the poem is the well-known 
superstition that a sacred bird or animal, if 
slain, will bring a curse upon the slayer. There- 
fore the “moral” expressed near the end is in 
a sense not applicable. It was not because the 
sailor wantonly slew a bird that the dreadful 
sufferings came upon him and his fellows, but 
-because the bird was sacred, the representative 
of the spirit that brooded over the vast waters LEGEND AND HISTORY 
of the southern ocean. This story of sailors’ 
superstition bas just the right setting: it 
is put into the mouth of an old sailor, and 
is told like a ballad, Coleridge's “Gloss,” 
or explanatory matter, printed in small type 
at the side of the text of the poem, is an imita- 
tion of something often found in medieval manu- 
scripts, where authors or their readers wrote 
similar explanations or abstracts of what they 
were reading. The skeleton ship, the awful 
figures of Life-in-Death and Death, the water- 
snakes, the curse in the eyes of the dead sailors 
~—these are all ballad elements that add to 
the wonder and terror of the tale. The ballad- 
stanza, the use of refrain and repetition, the 
peculiar rimes, are also examples of the way in 
which the poet has hit upon just the right form 
for telling such a tale. In your study of the 
poem, therefore, you should take note of these 
things, comparing the poem with a genuine 
ballad of the supernatural such as “The Wife 
of Usher’s Well.” 
7. The poem is much more than a marvelous 
imitation of the old ballads. You have already 
learned that one difference between the folk 
ballad and other forms of literature i is that i in 
the old ballads you a: . 
presence of the author; 
themselves. But the “. 
“a tale telling itself i: 
trary, you will easily {

careful planning of tt. 
comments; the detailed descriptions of Nature; 
the way in which the horror and mystery are 
dwelt on so that you are certa’- *- f--? 4h-* 
effects; and the deeper meanir 
as a whole—these supply all 
need of the difference between 
supernatural like “The Wife of 
and the “Ancient Mariner.” 
8. The sailors, who have merely surrendered 
to the superstition that the albatross is a 
bird of ill omen, are punished with death, 
Their crime was less than that of the Ancient} 
Mariner himself; therefore his is the greater| 
punishment. The Mariner is condemned to 
a life that is far more terrible than death. 
His suffering is not merely physical, but spirit- 
ual. He cannot pray until the hate that is in| 
his heart has turned to Jove. This love springs 
from Nature: the sight of the moon, a revela- 
tion of beauty be had not known before, and 
the unearthly beauty of the light that rests| 
upon the sea. As soon as Nature has taugh 
him this lesson of love, the spell is broken. 
From that moment, he can pray, and. th 
angelic spirits guide the ship back to th 
haven. The idea of Nature as a teacher, no!

THE ANCIENT MARINER 
pendent of his life, is one that Wordsworth as 
well as Coleridge taught in verse. You will 
find other illustrations of the meaning of this 
idea in your later reading; you will never find merely something external to man and inde- 
it more beautifully expressed than here. 
Questions anp Topics 
1. Note imitations of the ballad in the first 
five stanzas. Is the speaker clearly indicated 
in each case? Is there any formal introduction 
to the story or are you left to work out the 
situation for yourself? Is there anything corre- 
sponding to ballad repetition? Are stanza and 
' time like those of the ballad? 
%. Explain the meaning of the statement 
that the Mariner holds the Wedding-Guest 
“with his glitteriag eye.” Why does the 
Mariner stop the Wedding-Guest? Do you 
imagine he has stopped other men at other 
times? Why?. 
8. What is the effect of the interruption in 
stanzas vi-x? Why is stanza rx effective? 
What do you see as you read it? 
4. Into what parts of the world does the 
ship go? Follow its course through the re- 
mainder of the pcem? Where do the marvelous 
adventures take place? Would the tale be as 
convincing if the scene were laid in the English 
channel or in the Mediterranean? Why? 
5. Why is stanza xx effective? What do 
you see? 
6. Beginning with stanza xxi, where is 
the ship and in what direction is it moving? 
What share in the guilt have the sailors? What 
is the beginning of the curse? In what ways 
are you made aware that the experience these 
men were passing through was not the ordinary 
experience of men becalmed at sea? 
7. Study the approach of the strange ship. 
What effect had it at first on the Mariner? On 
the men? What vivid line is in stanza xxrx? 
In stanza xia? What is the effect of ques- 
tions rather than direct statements in stanzas 
xumt and xurv? Could you understand the 
meaning of xivi without the gloss? Of xiv? 
Why is xiv effective? The last line of 11? 
8. What do you see, as you look at the 
Mariner in reading 111? Who is the speaker? 
{ Would a description of the Mariner’s face be 
ag effective as the words of the Wedding-Guest? 
Why is stanza uv effective? Read the first 
9. Why is the Mariner unable to pray? line aloud, 
Several stanzas (ivi, ux, uxt) have more 
than four lines each; what effect is gained? 
uvm and Lxi-1xu. What brings 
  271 
about the change in the Mariner? Compare 
stanza Lxv with Lv. 
10, Stanzas Lxvii-1xx express the won- 
derful peace given by sleep after a great nervous 
strain or after the crisis of a disease. What 
changes in Nature take place after the curse 
islightened? Isthereany wind? Does it move 
the ship? Why? Does the Mariner pause 
again in his tale? Why? How do you know? 
11. Compare the sounds: and sights in 
stanzas LXXXU-LXxxiv with those in LxxI- 
uxxv. Explain the difference. 
12, Why does the ship stop? Where? What 
causes it to proceed? Study carefully stanzas 
EXxxvi-xct for the answers. 
18. Give in your own words the conversa- 
tion between the two spirits.. What do they 
represent? In what way does the curse return? 
What is the effect on the Mariner? Explain 
stanza.c. What breaks the spell? Study cv 
and tell what the stanza suggests to you. What 
happens to the bodies of the sailors? Why is 
the Mariner glad to see the Hermit? 
14. By what details are you made aware 
of the effect of the terrible journey on the ship 
itself? What is the value of your knowing 
this? Once more, observe that you are given 
this information indirectly, this time through 
the comments of the Pilot and the Hermit. 
15. Why does the ship sink? . What is the 
effect on the Pilot, the Hermit, the Pilot’s boy, 
the Mariner? 
16. What is the penance that the Mariner 
must pay? Does the Hermit impose it? What 
does? Does this seem reasonable to you? 
How does the Mariner know whom to stop? 
1%. Tell in your own words the meaning of 
stanzas CXXXVI-Cxxxvill. Of stanzas CxxxIx— 
cx. What is the effect of the story on the 
Wedding-Guest? On you? 
18. Pick out the old and obsolete words 
in the poem; the words and phrases conveying - 
sound and color; the Nature-pictures. 
19. Make a study of the Gloss, now that 
you have become familiar with the story. 
Does it help you to understand the poem? 
Does it add anything? What parts of the 
Gloss are not necessary to fuller understanding 
of the story? Do these parts add anything to 
the value of the poem? Why, or why not? 
20. Compare the poem, as a story of adven- 
ture at sea, with Zreasure Island. What dif- 
ferences do you recall in the description of the 
ships, of life at sea, etc. Do you think Cole- 
ridge could have written a good pirate story? 
21. What illustrations would you suggest 
for an edition of this poem? Describe in detail 
one or two of the most vivid of these subjects 
as if you were telling an artist what to put in 
his picture.

FORTY SINGING SEAMEN* 
Aurrep Noyrs 
Across the seas of Wonderland to Moga- 
dore we plodded, 
Forty singing seamen in an old black 
bark, 
And we landed in the twilight where a 
Polyphemus nodded 
With his battered moon-eye winking 
red and yellow through the dark! 
For his eye was growing mellow, 5 
Rich and ripe and red and yellow, 
As was time, since old Ulysses made him 
bellow in the dark! 
Cho.—Since Ulysses bunged his eye up with 
@ pine-torch in the dark! 
Were they mountains in the gloaming or 
the giant’s ugly shoulders 
Just beneath the rolling eyeball, with its 
bleared and vinous glow, 10 
Red and yellow o’er the purple of the 
pines among the bowlders 
And the shaggy horror brooding on the 
sullen slopes below? . 
Were they pines among the bowl- 
ders 
Or the hair upon his shoulders? 
We were only simple seamen, so of 
course we didn’t know. 16 
Cho.—We were simple singing seamen, so 
of course we couldn’t know. 
But we crossed a plain of poppies, and we 
‘came upon a fountain 
Not of water, but of jewels, like a spray 
of leaping fire; 
And behind it, in an emerald glade, be- 
neath a golden mountain 
There stood a crystal palace, for a sailor 
to admire; 20 
For a troop of ghosts came round 
us,

Which with leaves of bay they 
crowned us, 
Then with grog they well nigh drowned 
us, to the depth of our desire! 
Cho.—And ’twas very friendly of them, as 
a sailor can admire! 
There was music all about us; we were 
growing quite forgetful 25 
We were only singing seamen from the 
dirt of London-town, 
Though the nectar that we swallowed 
seemed to vanish half regretful 
As if we wasn’t good enough to take such 
vittles down, 
‘When we saw a sudden figure, 
Tall and black as any nigger, * 30 
Like the. Devil—only bigger—drawing 
near us with a frown! 
Cho.—Like the Devil—but much bigger— 
and he wore a golden crown! 
And “What’s all this?” he growls at us! 
With dignity we chanted, 
“Forty singing seamen, sir, as won’t be 
put upon!” 
“What? Englishmen?” he cries, “Well, if 
ye don’t mind béing haunted, 35 
Faith, you’re welcome to my palace; I’m 
the famous Prester John! 
Will ye walk into my palace? 
I don’t bear ’ee any malice! 
One and all ye shall be welcome in the 
halls of Prester John!

the halls of Prester John! 40 
Now the door was one great diamond and 
the hall a hollow ruby— 
Big as Beachy Head, my lads, na;

And I sees the mate wi’ mouth agape, 
a-staring like a booby, 
And the skipper close behind him, with! 
his tongue out like a calf!

Just as if you didn’t notice—so I couldn’t 
help but laugh! 
Cho—For they both forgot their man- 
ners and the crew was bound to 
laugh! ° 
But he took us through his palace and, 
my lads, as I’m a sinner, 
We walked into an opal like a sunset- 
colored cloud— 50 
“My dining-room,” he says, and, quick 
as light, we saw a dinner 
Spread before us by the fingers of a 
hidden fairy crowd; 
And the skipper, swaying gently 
After dinner, murmurs faintly, 
“TE looks to-wards you, Prester John, 
you’ve done us very proud!” 55 
Cho—And we drank his health with 
honors, for he done us very 
proud! 
Then he walks us to his garden where we 
sees a feathered demon 
Very splendid and important on a sort 
of spicy tree! 
“That’s the Phoenix,” whispers Prester, 
“which all eddicated seamen 
Knows the only one existent, and he’s 
waiting for to flee! a) 
When his hundred years expire 
Then he'll set hisself a-fire, 
And another from his ashes rise most 
beautiful to see!” 
Cho.—With wings of rose and emerald 
most beautiful to see! 
Then he says, “In yonder forest’ there’s a 
- little silver river, 65 
And whosoever drinks of it, his youth 
shall never die! 
The centuries go by, but Prester John en- 
dures forever 
With his music in the mountains and 
his magic on the sky! 
While your hearts are growing 
colder, 
While your world is growing older, 
There’s a magic in the distance, where 
the sea line meets the sky.” 71 273 
Cho.—It shall call to singing seamen till 
the fount o’ song is dry! 
So we thought we’d up and seek it, but 
that forest fair defied us— 
First a crimson leopard laughs at us 
most horrible to see, 
Then a sea-green lion came and sniffed and 
licked his chops and eyed us, 75 
While a red and yellow unicorn was 
dancing round a tree! 
We was trying to look thinner, 
Which was hard, because our 
dinner 
Must ha’ made us very tempting to a 
cat o” high degree! 
Cho.—Must ha’ made us very tempting to 
the whole menarjeree! 80 
So we scuttled from that forest and across 
the poppy meadows 
Where the awful shaggy horror brooded 
o’er us in the dark! 
And we pushes out from shore again 
a-jumping at our shadows, 
And pulls away most joyful to the old 
black bark! 
And home again we plodded 85 
While the Polyphemus nodded * 
With his battered moon-eye winking 
red and yellow through the dark, 
_Cho.—Oh, the moon above the mountains, 
red and yellow through the dark! 
Across the seas of Wonderland to London- 
town we blundered, 
Forty singing seamen as was puzzled for 
to know 90 
If the visions that we saw was caused by— 
here again we pondered— 
A tipple in a vision forty thousand years 
ago. 
Could the grog we dreamt we swal- 
- lowed 
Make us dream of all that fol- 
lowed? 
We were only simple seamen, so of 
course we didn’t know! 
Cho.—We were simple singing seamen, so 
of course we could not kiiow!

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This lively ballad is a recent version of a 
very old Jegend found in the folklore of many 
peoples. The theme that runs through ail 
" versions is that of a wanderer, or a company of 
wanderers, who meet with marvelous adven- 
tures on a mysterious island. Homer tells such 
a story of Ulysses on the island of Calypso, an 
enchantress, Stories about Circe, most famous 
of all enchantresses, are illustrations. There 
are many old Irish tales of a similar character. 
One of the best of the stories of this type is 
Tennyson’s “Voyage of Maeldune.” You 
might look up this poem in any complete 
edition of Tennyson. 
2. In order to enjoy Mr. Noyes’s poem it is 
not necessary for you to know all about the 
legends that are involved. Two of them, how- 
ever, are so interesting that they ought te be 
mentioned. The first is the story of Polyphe- 
mus, 2 giant whom Ulysses met on his travels, 
You should read the story in The Odyssey, 
Book IX, lines 130-670. When you have done - 
this, you will be able to point out the use Mr. 
Noyes makes of the one-eyed giant in this poem. 
What does he say of the giant’s eye in the 
first stanza? In the second? Has the giant 
turned into a mountain, judging from the 
second stanza? Do you find any further evi- 
dence later in the poem? “Look up the story 
of Atlas. Toward the end of the poem the 
giant’s eye is explained. What is it? Is there 
any suggestion of this earlier in the poem? 
* 8, The other story that is used in the poem 
is that of Prester John. He was a fabulous 
medieval king and priest (“prester” means 
“presbyter,” or priest). Many stories are told 
about him and about his kingdom. In the land 
of Prester John, which few travelers from 
Europe ever penetrated, there were many 
strange animals; there was a fountain of 
eternal youth (With what Spanish explorer in 
America is this story connected?); there were 
marvelous jewels and the most magnificent 
palace in the world. Which of these elements . 
in the Prester John story do you find in this 
poem? If you wish to know more about this 
wonderful king, look up his story in a good 
encyclopedia. 
4. Look up the story of the Phoenix in a 
book of mythology or an encyclopedia. Why 
ig the name Phoenix used by an insyrance 
company? 
5. Point out examples of sailors’ slang in the 
poem. “Forty Singing Seamen” was written 
as a humorous poem; do you find lines that 
seem to you particularly humorous?

BETH GELERT 
Wiii1am Rosert SPENCER 
The spearmen heard the bugle sound, 
And cheerily smiled the morn; 
And many a brach, and many a hound. 
Obeyed Llewellyn’s horn. 
And still he blew a louder blast, 5 
And gave a lustier cheer, 
“Come, Gélert, come, wert never last 
Llewellyn’s horn to hear. 
“O where does faithful Gélert roam, 
The flower of all his race; 10 
So true, so brave—a lamb at home, 
A lion in the chase?” 
In sooth, he was a peerless hound, 
The gift of royal John; 
But now no Gélert could be found, 15 
And all the chase rede on. 
That day Llewellyn little loved 
The chase of hart and hare; 
And scant and small the booty proved, 
For Gélert was not there. 20 
Unpleased, Llewellyn homeward hied, 
When, near the portal seat, 
His truant Gélert he espied, 
Bounding his lord to greet. 
But when he gained his castle-door, 25 
Aghast the chieftain stood; 
The hound all o’er was smeared with gore; 
His lips, his fangs, ran blood. 
Llewellyn gazed with fierce surprise; 
Unused such looks to meet, 30 
His favorite checked his joyful guise, 
And crouched, and licked his feet. 
Onward, in haste, Llewellyn passed, 
And on went Gélert too; 
And still, where’er his eyes he cast, 35 
Fresh blood-gouts shocked his view. 
O’erturned his infant’s bed he found, 
With blood-stained covert rent; 
And all around the walls and ground 
With recent blood besprent. 40
-P-A-G-E-284
THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE 
He called his child—no voice replied— 
He searched with terror wild; 
Blood, blood he found on every side, 
But nowhere found his child. 
“Hell-hound! my child’s by thee de- 
voured,” 45 
The frantic father cried; 
And to the hilt his vengeful sword 
He plunged in Gélert’s side. 
Aroused by Gélert’s dying yell, 
Some slumberer wakened nigh; 50 
What words the parent’s joy could tell 
To hear his infant’s cry! 
Concealed beneath a tumbled heap 
His hurried search had missed, 
All glowing from his rosy sleep, 55 
* The cherub boy he kissed. 
Nor scathe had he, nor harm, nor dread, 
But, the same couch beneath, 
Lay a gaunt wolf, all torn and dead, 
Tremendous still in death. 60 
Ah, what was then Llewellyn’s pain! 
For now the truth was clear; 
His gallant hound the wolf had slain 
To save Llewellyn’s heir. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Is this ballad like any of the old ballads 
that you have read? In what respect does it 
differ? 
2. Where do you imagine Gélert was when 
his master called him for the chase? How does 
the poet make us feel the master’s need: of his 
hound? Do you think it was only the loss 
of the dog’s help in the hunt that his master 
felt, or did he miss the dog’s companionship? 
What should Llewellyn have remembered 
when appearances were against the dog? 
8, -Many old ballads and stories recite the 
remorse consequent upon the hasty vow or the 
passionate act; can you tell why people handed 
down such stories from generation to generation? 
Do you know of an instance in which a hasty 
act brought deep remorse? 
4. What virtue does this ballad honor? 
What does it deplore? Do these things belong 
to one generation or are they common to all 
times? Why is this ballad a favorite? Would 
it have been loved by the people for whom the 
old ballads were made? 
5. What other poems that pay tribute to 
animals have you read? 275 
THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE 
Roszrr SouTHEY 
A Well there is in the west country, 
And a clearer one never was seen; _ 
There is not a wife in the west country 
But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne. 
An oak and an elm tree stand beside, 5 
And behind doth an ash-tree grow, 
And a willow from the bank above 
Droops to the water below. 
A traveler came to the Well of St. Keyne; 
Joyfully he drew nigh; 10 
For from cock-crow he had been traveling, 
And there was not a cloud in the sky. 
He drank of the water so cool and clear, 
For thirsty and hot was he, 
And he sat down upon the bank, 15 
Under the willow-tree. 
There came a.man from the house hard by, 
At the Well to fill his pail; 
On the Well-side be rested it, 
And bade the stranger hail. 20 
“Now, art thou a bachelor, Stranger?” 
quoth he; 
“For, and if thou hast a wife, 
‘The happiest draught thou hast drank this © 
day . 
That ever thou didst in thy life. 
“Or has thy good woman, if one thou hast, 
Ever here in Cornwall been? 26 
For, an if she have, I'll venture my life 
She has drunk of the Well of St. Keyne.” 
“T have left a good woman who never was 
here,” 
The stranger he made reply; ~ 30° 
“But that my draught should be better for. 
that, 
I pray you answer me why.” 
“St. Keyne,” quoth the Cornish-man, 
“many a time 
Drank of this crystal Well; 
And before the angel summoned her, 35 
She laid on the water a spell— 
“If the husband, of this gifted Well Shall drink before his wife,
-P-A-G-E-285
276 
A happy man henceforth is he, 
For he shall be master for life; 40 
“But if the wife should drink of it first, 
Heaven help the Husband then!” 
The Stranger stooped to the Well of St. 
Keyne, 
And drank of the water again. 
“You drank of the Well, I warrant, be- 
times?” 45 
He to the Cornish-man said; 
But the Cornish-man smiled as the stran- 
ger spake, 
And sheepishly shook his head: 
“T hastened, as soon as the wedding was 
done, 
And left my wife in the porch; 50 
But i’ faith, she had been wiser than me, 
For she took a bottle to church.” 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. In the parish of St. Neots, Cornwall, is 
a well, dedicated to St. Keyne. It was believed 
that if husband and wife came to this well, the 
one who drank first would get the mastery. 
. 9% Of what other ballads does the opening 
of this ballad remind you? 
3. Who are represented as holding converse 
at the well? What does this device of ques- 
tion and answer add to the ballad? In what 
older ballad did you find this device employed? 
4, Why did the traveler drink of the well 
~ the second time? What does the story gain 
from the fact that the poet offers no explana- 
tion for this act? 
5. Where is the climax of the story? 
6. Do you think the story stops at the right 
Point or do you think something more is 
needed? What argument can you give to 
support your opinion? 
DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB 
Lorp Byron 
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on - 
the fold; 
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple 
and gold; LEGEND AND HISTORY 
And the sheen of their spears was like stars 
on the sea, 
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep 
Galilee. 
Like the leaves of the forest when summer 
is green, 5 
That host with their ‘banners at sunset 
were seen; 
Like the leaves of the forest when autumn 
hath blown, 
That host on the morrow lay withered and 
strown. 
For the Angel of Death spread his wings 
on the blast, 
And breathed in the face of the foe as hé 
passed; : 10 
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly 
and chill; 
And their hearts but once heaved, and 
forever grew still! 
And there lay the steed with his nostril all 
wide, 
But through it there rolled not the breath 
of his pride; 
And the foam of his gasping lay white on 
the turf, 15 
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating 
surf. 
And there lay the rider distorted and pale, 
With the dew on his brow.and the rust on 
his mail; 
And the tents were all silent, the banners 
alone, 
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown. 
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Sennacherib was King of Assyria. His 
army invaded Judea and besieged Jerusalem, 
but was overthrown; the bulk of his army was 
destroyed in @ single night. Sennacherib re- 
turned in haste with the remnant of his army 
to his own country. Byron’s description of 
this incident in Biblical history is one of the 
most beautiful in literature. For the Bible 
story of this event, read 2 Kings x1x, 6-36. 
2. Read the poem aloud, to enjoy the 
rhythm. Indicate the rhythm by the use of 
vertical lines. 
8. Note the development: the brilliant on- 
set of the Assyrian cavalry; their summer 
changes to winter; the angel turns their sleep 
into death; the steed and the rider; the 
mourning; their idols powerless to help them; 
their religion broken down; their power 
“melted like snow’; point out lines in which 
each of these steps is traced. 
4. The poet makes large use of comparison; 
point out effective examples. Explain the use 
of “The Assyrian,” in line 1. 
&. What gives you the impression that the 
Assyrian army was very large? What lines 
describe the splendor of the Assyrian army? 
What tells you that the Assyrian army was 
destroyed in the night?

As stilly stole-by a bold legion of horse, 
For Hale in the bush, for Hale in the

“Keep still!” said the thrush, as she nestled 
her young : 5 
In a nest by the road, in a nest by the

“For the tyrants are near, and with them 
appear 
What bodes us no good, what bodes us 
no good.” 
‘The brave captain heard it, and thought of 
his home 
In a cot by the brook, in a cot by the 
brook; 10 
With mother and sister and memories 
dear, 
He so gaily forsook, he so gaily forsook. 
Cooling shades of the night were coming 
apace, 
The tattoo had beat, the tattoo had

The noble one sprang from his dark lurking- 
place 15 
To make his retreat, to make his retreat. 
‘He warily trod on the dry, rustling leaves, 
As he passed through the wood, as he 
passed through the wood, 
And silently gained his rude launch on the

As she played with the flood, as she 
played with the flood. 20

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
The author of this ballad is unknown. It is 
a good example of the ballad, since it is a story, 
told in verse, of an event that powerfully moved 
the people who knew about it. One of these 
people composed the ballad. The poem is, a 
tribute to Nathan Hale, who was hanged as a 
spy in September, 1776. You remember his 
dying words: “I only regret that I have but 
one life to give for my country!” 
HERVE RIEL 
Rosert Brownine 
On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen 
hundred ninety-two, 
Did the English fight the French—woe 
to France! 
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter 
through the blue, 
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a 
shoal of sharks pursue, 
Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo 
on the Rance, 5 
‘With the English fleet in view. 
*Twas the squadron that escaped, with the 
victor in full chase; 
First and foremost of the drove, in his 
great ship, Damfreville; 
Close on. him fled, great and small, 
Twenty-two good ships in all; 10 
And they signaled to the place, 
“Help the winners of a race! 
Give us guidance, give us harbor, take us 
. quick—or, quicker still, 
Here’s the English can and will!” 
, Then the pilots of the place put out brisk 
and leapt on board; 15 
“Why, what hope or chance have ships 
like these to pass?” laughed they; HERVE RIEL 279 
“Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the 
passage scarred and scored, 
Shall the Formidable here with her twelve 
and eighty guns 
Think to make the river-mouth by the 
single narrow way,° 
Trust to enter where “tis ticklish for a 
craft of twenty tons, 20 
And with flow at full beside? 
Now, ’tis slackest ebb of tide. 
Reach the mooring? Rather say, 
While rock stands or water runs, 
Not a ship will leave the bay!” 25 
Then was called a council straight. 
Brief and bitter the debate: 
“Here’s the English at our heels; would 
you have them take in tow 
All that’s left us of the fleet, linked together 
stern and bow, . 
For a prize to Plymouth Sound? 30 
Better run the ships aground!” 
(Ended Damfreville his speech.) 
“Not a minute more to wait! 
Let the Captains all and each 
Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the 
vessels on the beach! 35 
France must undergo her fate. 
“Give the word!” But no such word 
Was ever spoke or heard; 
For up stood, for out stepped, for in 
struck amid all these 
—A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate— 
first, second, third? 40 
No such man of mark, and meet 
With his betters to compete! 
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by 
Tourville for the fleet, 
A poor coasting-pilot he, Hervé Riel the 
Croisickese. 
And, “What mockery or malice have we 
here?” cries Hervé Riel; _ 45

All are harbored to the last,

Up the English come—too late!

Hearts that bled are stanched with balm. 
“Just our rapture to enhance;

“This is Paradise for Hell! 95 
Let France, let France’s King 
Thank the man that did the thing!” 
What a shout, and all one word, 
“Hervé Riel!” 
As he stepped in front once more, 
Not a symptom of surprise 
In the frank blue Breton eyes, 
Just the same man as before. 
Then said Damfreville, “My friend, 
T must speak out at the end, 
Though I find the speaking hard. 
Praise is deeper than the lips; 
You have saved the King his ships, 
‘You must name your own reward. 
’Faith, our sun was near eclipse! 
Demand whate’er you will, 
France remains your debtor still. 
Ask to heart’s content and have! or my 
name’s not Damfreville.” 105 
110 
Then a beam of fun outbroke 
On the bearded mouth that spoke, 
As the honest heart laughed through 
Those frank eyes of Breton blue: 
“Since I needs must say my say, 
Since on board the duty’s done, 
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, 
what is it but a run?— 120 
Since ’tis ask and have, I may— 
Since the others go ashore— 
Come—A good whole holiday! 
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I 
call the Belle Aurore!”

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Early in 1692 King Louis of France 
planned the invasion of England with an army 
of 30,000 men. Transports were provided for 
their passage, and the French fleet under Admiral 
Tourville was ordered to protect their crossing. 
In a battle near La Hogue the French were 
badly defeated by the English and fled away 
along the rocky coast. Twenty-two of their 
vessels reached St. Malo and were piloted 
through the shallows at the mouth of the river 
to safety under the fortress Solidor. 
2. Is this a ballad? Why do you think so? 
Have you read any other ballad that has as 
long lines as this? Compare these long lines 
with the short lines of some ballads you have 
read and note the difference in musical effect. 
8. To what is the flight of the French 
squadron compared in the first stanza? What 
makes this an appropriate comparison? 
4, What did the ships signal to the port? 
What answer did the pilots give? What do you 
think was their reason for answering in this 
way? 
5, Who held council? To what decision did 
they come? What prevented the carrying out 
of this plan? 
6. Notice the words which the poet uses to 
tell us that someone broke in on the Captains’ 
council. Are these different expressions neces- 
sary? Does such a line make smooth reading? 
What do you think was the poet’s reason for 
making such a line? Read the next line. Here 
the poet suggests official titles only to reject 281 
them. Can you read this line smoothly? Does 
it add anything to the impressivencss of the 
scene? 
7. What was Hervé Riel’s opinion of the 
St. Malo pilots? What request did he make? 
Was his experience such as to justify him in 
believing that he could find the channel? Was 
Hervé Riel under any obligation to make this 
offer? Think how easily he might have excused 
himself if he had kept silence. What might he 
have thought or said afterward? Do you think 
France had ever done very much for Hervé 
Riel? Did that fact influence him? Has 
anyone the right to choose whether he will be 
patriotic or not? 
8. What do you think of Damfreville’s 
gpeech of thanks? What do you think of 
Hervé Riel’s answer? What words tell you 
much about the sailor’s character? . 
9. Was it possible to repay Hervé Riel 
for his service?

My leg, matheureusement, I left it bebind 
on the banks of the Aisne. 
Regret? I would pay with the other e 
witness their valor again. 
A trifle, indeed, I assure you, to give for 
the honor to tell 
How that handful of British, undaunted, 
went into the Gateway of Hell. 
Let me draw you a plan of the battle. 
Here we French and your Engineers 
stood; . 
Over there a detachment of German sharp- 
shooters lay hid in a wood. 10

A mitrailleuse battery planted on top of 
this well-chosen ridge 
Held the road for the Prussians. and cov- 
ered the direct approach to the bridge. 
It was madness to dare the dense murder 
that spewed from those ghastly ma- 
chines. 
(Only those who have danced to its music 
can know what the mitrailleuse means.) 
But the bridge on the Aisne was a menace; 
our safety demanded its fall: 15 
“Engineers—volunteers!” In a body, the 
Royals stood out at the call. 
- 
Death at best was the fate of that mission— 
to their glory not one was dismayed. 
A party was chosen—and seven survived 
till the powder was laid, 
And they died with their fuses unlighted. 
Another detachment! Again 
A sortie is made—all too vainly. The 
bridge still commanded the Aisne. 20 
We were fighting two foes—Time and 
Prussia—the moments were worth 
more than the troops. 
We must blow up the bridge. A lone 
soldier darts out from the Royals 
and swoops 
For the fuse! Fate seems with us. We 
cheer him; he answers—our hopes 
are reborn! 
A ball rips his visor—his khaki shows red 
where another has torn. 24 
Will he live—will he last—will he make it? 
Hélas! And so near the goal! 
A second, he dies! then a third one! A 
fourth! Still the Germans take toll! 
A fifth, magnifique! It is magic! How 
does he escape them? Hemay.... 
Yes, he does! See, the match flares! A 
rifle rings out from the woed and says, “Nay!” 
Six, seven, eight, nine take their places, 
six, seven, eight, nine brave their hail; 
11. mitrailleuse, machine gun. 28. Hétas, alas. 
27. magnifique, magni! 
     LEGEND AND HISTORY 
Six, seven, eight, nine—how we count 
them! But the sixth, seventh, eighth, 
and ninth fail! 30 
A tenth! Sacré nom! But these English 
are soldiers—they know how to try; 
(He fumbles the place where his jaw was)— 
they show, too, how heroes can die. 
Ten we count—ten who ventured unquail- 
.ing—ten there were—and ten are no 
more! 
Yet another salutes and superbly essays 
where the ten failed before. . 
God of Battles, look down and protect 
him! Lord, his heart is as Thine— 
let him live! 35 
But mitrailleuse splutters and stutters, and 
riddles him into a sieve. 
Then I thought of my sins, and sat waiting 
the charge that we could not with-~ 
stand. 
And I thought of my beautiful Paris, and 
gave a last look at the land, 
At France, my belle France, in her glory of 
blue sky and green field and wood. 
Death with honor, but never surrender. 
And to die with such men—it was 
good. 40 
They are forming—the bugles are blaring— 
they will cross in a moment and 
then... . 
When out of the line of the Royals (your 
island, mon amt, breeds men) 
Burst a private, a tawny-haired giant—it 
was hopeless, but, ciel! how he ran! 
Bon Dieu, please remember the pattern, 
and make many more on his plan! 
No cheers from our ranks, and the Ger- 
mans, they halted in wonderment too; 45 
See, he reaches the bridge; ah! he lights it! 
I am dreaming, it cannot be true. 
Screams of rage! Fusillade! They have 
killed him! Too late though, the 
good work is done. 
By the valor, of twelve English martyrs, 
the Hell-Gate of Soissons is won!

Franceline rose in the dawning gray, 
And her heart would dance though she 
knelt to pray, 
For her man Michel had holiday, 
Fighting for France. 
She offered her prayer by the cradle- 
side, 
And with baby palms folded in hers she 
cried: 6 
“If I have but one prayer, dear, crucified 
Christ—save France! 
‘But if I have two, then, by Mary’s grace, 
Carry me safe to the meeting-place, 10 
Let me look once again on my dear love’s 
face, 
Save him for France!” 
She croontd to her boy: “Oh, how glad he'll 
be, Little three-months old, to set eyes on 
thee! 
For, ‘Rather than gold, would I give,’ 
wrote he, 15

“Six days’ leave and a year between! 
But what would you have? In six days

To the marching troops in the street she

Silent they marched like a pantomime; 30 
“But what need of music? My heart beats 
time— 
Vive la France!” 
His regiment comes. Oh, then where is he? 
“There is dust in my eyes, for I cannot 
see— 
Is that my Michel to the right of thee, 35

Then out of the ranks a comrade fell— 
“Yesterday—’twas a splinter of sheli— 
' And he whispered thy name, did thy poor _

Dying for France.” 40

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Kipling is the friend of the brave man 
everywhere, but he is especially the friend of 
the British soldier, because he knows him so 
well. In this ballad he presents the grievance 
of Tommy Atkins, as the British regular soldier 
is called. Remember, this poem was written 
long before the World War. ‘To what can you 
ascribe the refusal of the public house to serve 
the soldier? How can you explain his treat- 
ment in the theater? 
2. How can you account for the fact that 
soldiers are so poorly paid? 285 
3. What qualities are needed to make a 
good soldier? 
4. How much of the indifference shown 
toward ‘soldiers in time of peace may be at-

a SIR WALTER SCOTT ja 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
SCOTT’S “LADY OF THE LAKE” 
AN INTRODUCTION 
I 
Tur Avtnor or THE PorM 
Sir Walter Scott, like most writers of 
great literature, was a man to whom life 
was a marvelous adventure. For many 
generations his ancestors had been men 
fond of daring deeds. His father, an 
Edinburgh lawyer, was the first of his 
family to live in a city. Auld Wat, of the 
Lay of the Last Minstrel, belonged to the 
sixth generation before Sir Walter. Auld 
Wat’s son William was asked to choose 
between being hanged, after he had been 
captured in a Border raid, and marrying 
the ugliest, of his captor’s daughters. 
The lady had the reputation of being the 
ugliest in four counties, and William was 
a handsome man. After three days’ 
consideration of the matter he married the 
girl. 
Sir Walter, who. was born August 15, 
1771, in Edinburgh, Scotland, was the 
ninth of twelve children. He was lame 
from childhood, and at sixteen was struck 
by an illness so severe that for a long 
time he was compelled to remain in bed 
without speaking to anyone. He ar- 
ranged -the mirrors about his bed in such 
a way that he could watch the troops 
marching in the meadows. From child- 
hood he loved. animals and out-of-door 
sports. He had a pet pony that came into 
the house to be fed. He learned ballads 
by heart and shouted them at the top of 
his voice. At fifteen, he took up the 
study of law, in which he was distinguished 
for his prodigious memory; but his school- 
ing was more or less irregular, and his real 
delight, apart from his pets and his sports, 
was in reading history, romance, and 
ballads. He learned Italian and Spanish 
in order to read some tales of chivalry and 
burlesque romance. Often he would tramp 
long distances in search of ballads or of 
some legend that had captured his fancy. Some time after his marriage to the 
daughter of a French royalist who had 
died during the Revolution, he published 
a collection of ballads under the title The 
Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. The 
first two volumes of this collection ap- 
peared in 1802, and 850 copies were sold 
within a year. The third volume was 
published in 1803. Two years later his 
first important original work appeared, 
The Lay of the Last Minstrel. This poem 
grew out of his collection of native bal- 
lads, and 44,000 copies of it were sold in 
twenty-five years. In 1808 Marmion 
appeared, composed in great part while 
he was out on riding expeditions. He 
spoke of himself, at about this time, as a 
rattle-skulled, half-lawyer, half-sportsman, 
through whose head a regiment of horse 
had been exercising since he was five years 
old. Parts of Marmion were read to. 
Scottish troops when they were under 
French fire. 
Perhaps the best way to realize the 
abounding vitality of Scott, and the zest 
which he found in life, is to fix, one’s 
attention for a moment on his life at 
Ashestiel, overlooking the Tweed, where 
he lived from 1804 to 1812: He rose at 
five and by six was at his desk, with 
books on every side of him. Breakfast 
came at nine and after a little more work 
he was “his own man.” On rainy days 
he worked all day, but was in the habit 
of allowing excess work on such days to 
count in favor of a longer time out-of-doors 
when the weather was fine. His rule was. 
to be out by one o’clock; long trips would 
begin by ten. It has been said that his 
life might be divided, as history is divided 
into reigns, by the succession of his favorite 
horses and dogs. His horses, in succession, 
were Captain, Lieutenant, Brown Adam, 
Daisy, Sybil Grey, and Covenanter. His 
favorite dogs were Camp, Maida, and 
Nimrod. When Camp died, Scott refused 
287
-P-A-G-E-297
288 
a dinner invitation on account of “the 
death of an old friend.” To Maida he 
erected a marble monument. One of his 
chief sports was salmon-spearing by torch- 
light—“burning the water,” as it was 
called. 
These eight years, despite the seeming 
disproportion between the hours at his 
- desk and his hours out-of-doors, were 
marked by tremendous accomplishment. 
He finished The Lay of the Last Minstrel, 
wrote Marmion, The Lady of the Lake, part 
of The Bridal of Triermain, and part of 
Rokeby. In addition he wrote a life of 
Dryden, edited many volumes of records 
and historical materials, and began an 
edition of Swift. During part of this time 
he also held the offices of sheriff and deputy 
clerk of the session. 
In May of 1812 he moved to Abbotsford, 
five miles down the ‘Tweed from Ashestiel, 
near Melrose Abbey. With him he took 
twenty-five cartloads of “trash,” beside 
dogs, pigs, ponies, poultry, cows, calves, 
“bareheaded wenches and bare-breeched 
boys.” ‘There were old swords, bows, 
targets, and lances. He said, “The very . 
cows, for aught I know, were bearing 
banners and muskets.” All animals loved 
him; his servants and the poor adored 
him. At Abbotsford he acquired a hun- 
dred acres of land, to which he constantly 
added, so that he possessed an estate of 
baronial proportions..To keep up this 
estate required an enormous income, For 
a time he succeeded, since in addition to 
his official salaries the returns from his 
literary work were very great. For The 
Lay of the Last Minstrel he received £600; 
for Marmion £1000. When he gave up 
his law practice he became a partner in 
the publishing house of the Ballantynes. 
In 1814 he turned from metrical romance 
to prose. Waverley; begun in 1805, was 
the result. The last two volumes of the 
work were written in three weeks. In 
the next fourteen years he produced 
twenty-three novels and some tales. All 
these were published anonymously, partly 
because he feared that his reputation 
- as a poet might be injured if it were 
found that he was writing prose romance, 
and partly because he delighted in mys- 
‘tifying the public. He liked being a LEGEND AND HISTORY 
private man one day and a king the next. 
He lived many lives actually as well as in 
the creation of so many characters in his 
tales. 
The prose romances relate to many 
periods and show the most exhaustive 
study of the periods he described. Through 
his imaginative power, the brilliant light in 
which he saw past events, he re-created 
past times as truly as Shakespeare in his 
historical plays. Old Mortality goes back 
more than a century before his own time; 
Quentin Durward belongs to the fifteénth 
century and Kenilworth to the sixteenth, 
while Ivanhoe and The Talisman go back 
five centuries. Other romances belong 
nearer his own time. In all this. vast 
expanse of history Scott moves like a 
man among familiar haunts. It is as 
though he could project himself at will 
out of the body of his mortal life and take 
up a temporary abode amid scenes and 
people of distant generations. Thus he 
appeals to old and young, and to men of 
every occupation. Puritans and Cavaliers 
live in his pages, as well as outlaws, border 
chiefs, lords and ladies of Elizabeth’s 
court, gypsies, beggars, every rank and 
condition of men. For this reason, no 
one can read Scott without an enlarge- 
ment of his sympathy, a quickening of his 
imagination, and a sense of the reality of 
history such as textbooks cannot give. 
In this he is like Shakespeare. 
Scott lived at Abbotsford from 1814 to 
1825. He lived like a feudal baron, sur- 
rounded by retainers, possessing a vast 
estate, visited by throngs of men and 
women from every part of the world. 
He had an enormous correspondence. 
He befriended young writers who made 
pilgrimages to his estate. Washington 
Irving writes delightfully of his own visits 
to Abbotsford, and Scott was one of the 
first to recognize the worth of Irving’s 
Knickerbocker, the first. considerable work 
of prose imagination written in America. 
Financial trouble came upon Scott in 
1826. He had himself lived for years 
beyond his income. His publishers were 
unfortunate in some of their ventures; 
at last they failed, the liabilities being more 
than £100,000. Scott was then fifty-five 
years old. His wife, whose health had
-P-A-G-E-298
THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
been failing for some time, died four 
months after the crisis. Two days later 
Scott was at work on Woodstock, deter- 
mined to pay off the whole gigantic in- 
debtedness. No knight of chivalry ever 
devoted himself to so generous and lofty a 
task. Scott was not legally liable, and 
might have escaped without contributing 
a cent to the creditors. He was not made 
of that kind of stuff. He spoke of adver- 
sity as a “tonic and bracer.” In two 
years he had paid off £40,000 of the debt. 
He gave up his dearly loved home and 
went to live in lodgings in Edinburgh. 
By 1830 he had paid £63,000. Soon 
after, he was stricken by paralysis and 
sailed for Malta in an effort to regain his 
health. On the 7th of July, 1832, he 
returned to Abbotsford, so wasted from 
sickness that he was almost helpless, but 
so overjoyed at his return that it was 
with difficulty that he was held in his 
carriage. It was like the return of 
Ulysses to Ithaca. Scott’s dogs, like the 
faithful dog of Ulysses immortalized by 
Homer, welcomed him as eagerly as his 
friends and dependents. After a few 
days, he made a manful effort to do some 
more writing, but it was impossible. 
Before death came he was in a state of 
coma for days. On the 17th of September 
he had a moment of consciousness, when 
he spoke the famous words to Lockhart, 
his son-in-law, “Lockhart, I may have 
but a moment to speak to you. My dear, 
be a good man—be virtuous, be religious— 
be a good man. Nothing else will give 
you any comfort when you come to lie 
here.” : 
So died, September 21, 1882, a brave- 
hearted and knightly gentleman. The 
copyright on his works, assigned to the 
creditors, paid off the balance of the debt 
in fifteen years. He had liked, in the 
time of vigor and prosperity, to think of 
himself as the head of a great house, a sur- 
vivor into the nineteenth century of the 
nobleman of heroic times. In this he 
failed. His poems and tales, valued by 
himself mainly as a means for providing 
his estate and later for paying the obliga- 
tions that he voluntarily assumed, are 
immortal. Immortal, too, is his per- 
sonality. In his vast appetite for life, for 289 
friendship; in his love for nature and dogs; 
in his Jove for old tales and for the simple, 
straightforward life they dealt with, he 
reminds one of Theodore Roosevelt. Un- 
like the great American, Scott had no sense 
of reform or mission, Through the in- 
fluence of a great personality, each man 
was greater than the work he performed. 
Like Ulysses, they were men cast in 
heroic mold. 
I 
Tus Por 
The Lady of the Lake is a story dealing 
with the life of King James V of Scotland, 
who lived in the sixteenth century. The 
events narrated in it may be imagined as 
having taken place in about 1529, and 
while the story is not historical, being 
chiefly the product of Scott’s imagination, 
it is a good example of the poet’s power 
to reconstruct the life of a past time so 
vividly as to give to it something of the 
truth of history. The historical back- 
ground needed for a clearer reading of the 
poem is here given. 
As a boy, King James was under the 
guardianship of Archibald Douglas, Earl 
of Angus, who had married his mother. 
The young King for a long time wished to 
free himself, but the Douglases were a 
powerful clan, and virtually held James as 
their captive. In 1528, however, he 
escaped to Stirling Castle, where he was 
received by the governor, an enemy to 
the Douglas clan. In a short time so 
many chieftains joined the King that 
they were able to banish the Earl of Angus 
to England. The Douglas whom we 
meet in the poem is an imaginary uncle of 
the banished regent, who is hiding on a 
lonely island in Loch Katrine under the 
protection of Roderick Dhu. Both the 
Douglas of the poem, therefore, and 
Roderick, are fictitious characters. The 
same is true of Ellen, the Lady of the 
Lake, Malcolm Greeme, and the minstrel, 
Allan-bane. But all these characters are 
drawn from an intimate knowledge of the 
history and customs of the time, and the 
action of the poem might well have taken 
place in 1529, when the King took steps 
toward putting an end to the outrages that
-P-A-G-E-299
290° 
had long characterized life on the Scottish 
Border. 
The name of the poem is itself a sug- 
gestion of the romantic character of the 
story. The old romances about Arthur 
and the knights of the Round Table 
had much to say about a fairy called 
the Lady of the Lake, who lived on a 
mysterious island which mortals could 
visit only rarely and where wonderful 
adventures awaited them. Ellen, you 
will observe, is called a fairy, though not 
with any suggestion of supernatural 
qualities. The minstrel, Allan-bane, is 
just such a person as one meets in the old 
romances. Such minstrels were not mere 
entertainers; they were wise men whose 
counsel was highly valued; and many of 
them were supposed to possess the gift of 
prophecy. 
Other illustrations of the romantic 
spirit that gives charm to the poem are 
easily found. The summoning of the 
warriors by means of the small wooden 
cross with its points scorched and dipped 
in blood, vividly suggests a primitive life, 
one in which simple passions of hate, 
loyalty, and the spirit of the clan figure 
in place of the conventional virtues of 
courtly society. Indeed, this story will 
no doubt seem even more primitive than 
the story of Ulysses among the Pheacians. 
Again, you will notice the relatively large 
space given to descriptions of nature. 
This is characteristic of the age in which 
Scott lived. Men began to find in the 
wilder aspects of nature a fascination 
that the eighteenth century utterly failed 
torealize. Wordsworth, Byron, and Scott 
_ owed much of their popularity to the fact 
that in their poems the beauty of river and 
forest, of the mountains and remote and: 
almost inaccessible places, found expres- 
sion, An excellent illustration of this is 
to be found in the fact that immediately 
following the publication of The Lady of 
the Lake in 1810, the journey to Loch’ 
Katrine and Ellen’s Isle became -a sort 
of pilgrimage for hundreds of travelers. LEGEND AND HISTORY 
You will observe that the poem is 
divided into six cantos, or divisions, corre- 
sponding somewhat to the acts of a drama. 
These cantos are much shorter than the 
“books,” or divisions, of the epic poem. 
Each canto is subdivided into smaller 
units, of varying numbers of lines, which 
are not stanzas but serve the same pur- 
pose, that of breaking up the narrative 
into paragrapb-like units. The verse 
rimes in couplets, and in the normal line 
there are four accents, or stresses. This 
verse-form lends itself to rapidity of 
movement; the eight syllables in the line, 
with the rime, give a sort of rhythmic beat 
like that of the ballad. Variety is gained 
through the introduction of songs and of 
little poems of introduction and conclusion, 
in the various cantos, written in a different 
meter. 
The Lady of the Lake is neither ballad 
nor epic but metrical romance. In this 
respect it revives a form of poetry popular 
all over civilized Europe from the twelfth 
to the sixteenth century. The most 
famous of these old romances were written 
about King Arthur and his knights, or 
about Charlemagne, the great king of 
France. They dealt with the age of 
chivalry, while Scott deals here with a 
later period. Scott’s poem has many of 
the characteristics of the ballad, as you 
will see if you compare it with one of the 
romantic ballads. previously read. But 
it tells a long and sustained story, and this 
the ballad cannot do. It is-like the epic 
in its use of history and legend, and in its 
portrayal of the life of a past time through 
a poetic biography of national or racial 
heroes. But it is more simple than the 
epic; it lacks the stately dignity that you 
have found in the story of Ulysses. It also 
finds a large part of its interest in the love- 
story, something that the epic does not 
stress. King James is a romantic and 
deeply interesting figure, but he is not the 
founder of a civilization, like one of the 
heroes of the epics written so many cen- 
turies ago.

Tue Cusp 
Harp of the North! that moldering long 
hast hung | 
On the witch-elm that shades Saint

And down the fitful breeze thy numbers 
flung, Till envious ivy did around thee cling, 
Muffling with verdant ringlet every

O Minstrel Harp, still must thine 
accents sleep? 
Mid rustling leaves and fountains mur- 
muring, 
Still must thy sweeter sounds their 
silence keep, 
Nor bid a warrior smile, nor teach a maid 
to weep? 
Not thus, in ancient days of Caledon, 10 
Was thy voice mute amid the’ festal 
crowd 
When lay of hopeless love, or glory won, 
Aroused the fearful, or subdued the 
proud. 
At each according pause was heard aloud 
Thine ardent symphony sublime and 
high! 15 
Fair dames and crested chiefs attention 
bowed; 
For still the burden of thy minstrelsy 
Was Knighthood’s dauntless deed, and 
Beauty’s matchless eye.

A moment snuffed the tainted gale, 
A moment listened to the ery,

A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong; 
Clattered a hundred steeds along; 
Their peal the merry horns rung out; 60 
A hundred voices joined the shout. 
With hark and whoop and wild halloo, 
No rest Benvoirlich’s echoes knew. 
Far from the tumult fled the roe; 
Close in her covert cowered the doe; 65 
The falcon, from her cairn on high, 
Cast on the rout a wondering eye, 
Till far beyond her piercing ken 
The hurricane had swept the glen. 
Faint, and more faint, its failing din 70 
Returned from cavern, cliff, and linn, 
And silence settled, wide and still, 
On the lone wood and mighty hill.

Less loud the sounds of silvan war 
Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var, 15

The noble stag was pausing now 
Upon the mountain’s southern brow, 
Where broad extended, far beneath, 
The varied realms of fair Menteith, 
With anxious eye he wandered o’er 90 
Mountain and meadow; moss and moor, 
And pondered refuge from his toil, 
By far Lochard or Aberfoyle. 
But nearer was the copsewood gray 
That waved and wept on Loch-Achray, 95 
And mingled with the pine-trees blue 
On the bold cliffs of Benvenue. 
Fresh vigor with the hope returned, 
With flying foot the heath he spurned, 
Held westward with unwearied race, 100° 
And left behind the panting chase.

What reins were tightened in despair, 
When rose Benledi’s ridge in air; 
Who flagged upon Bochastle’s heath, 
Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith— 
For twice that day, from shore to shore, 
The gallant stag swam stoutly o’er. 
Few were the stragglers, following far, 110 
That reached the lake of Vennachar; 
And when the Brigg of Turk was won, 105 
_ The headmost horseman rode alone. 
VIE 
Alone, but with unbated zeal, 114 
That horseman plied the scourge and steel; 
For jaded now, and spent with toil, 
Embossed with foam, and dark with soil, 
While every gasp with sobs he drew, 
The laboring stag strained full in view. 
Two dogs of black Saint Hubert’s breed, 
Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed, 
Fast on his flying traces came, 122 
And all but won that desperate game; 
For, scarce a spear’s length from his 
haunch, 
Vindictive toiled the bloodhounds stanch; 
Nor nearer might the dogs attain, 
Nor farther might the quarry strain. 
Thus up the margin of the lake, 
Between the precipice and brake, 129 
O’er stock and rock their race they take. 
Vir 
The hunter marked that mountain high, 
The lone lake’s western boundary, 
And deemed the stag must turn to bay 
Where that huge rampart barred the way; 
Already glorying in the prize, ~ 135 
Measured his antlers with his eyes; 
For the death-wound and death-halloo, 
Musiered his breath, his whinyard drew— 
But thundering as he came prepared, 
With ready arm and weapon bared, 
The wily quarry shunned the shock, 
And turned him from the opposing rock; 
Then dashing down a darksome glen, 
Soon lost to hound and Hunter’s ken, 
In the deep Trosachs’ wildest nook 
His solitary refuge took. . 
There, while close couched, the thicket shed 
Cold dews and wild-flowers on his head,

Chiding the rocks that yelled again. 
Ix 
Close on the hounds the Hunter came, 
To cheer them on the vanished game; 
But, stumbling in the rugged dell, 
The gallant horse exhausted fell. 185 
The impatient rider strove in vain 
To rouse him with the spur and rein, 
For the good steed, his labors o’er, 
Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more; 
Then, touched with pity and remorse, 160 
He sorrowed o’er ‘the expiring horse. 
“T little thought, when first thy rein 
I slacked upon the banks of Seine, 
That Highland eagle e’er should feed _ 164 
On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed! 
Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day, 
That costs thy life, my gallant gray!” 
x 
Then through the dell his horn resounds, 
From vain pursuit to call the hounds. 169 
Back limped, with slow and crippled pace, 
The sulky leaders of the chase; 
Close to their master’s side they pressed, 
With drooping tail and humbled crest; 
But still the dingle’s hollow throat 
Prolonged the swelling bugle-note. 175, 
The owlets started from their dream; 
The eagles answered with their scream; 
Round and around the sounds were cast, 
Till echo seemed an answering blast. 
And on the Hunter hied his way, 180 - 
To join some comrades of the day; 
Yet often paused, so strange the road, 
So wondrous were the scenes it showed. 
xI - 
The western waves of ebbing day 
Rolled o’er the glen their level way; 185 
Each purple peak, each flinty spire, 
Was bathed in floods of living fire. 
But not a setting beam could glow 
Within the dark ravines below, 
Where twined the path in shadow hid, 190 
Round many a rocky pyramid, 
Shooting abruptly from the dell 
Its thunder-splintered pinnacle; ' 
Round many an insulated mass, 
The native bulwarks of the pass, 195 
166. Woe worth, woe be to. 293 
Huge as the tower which builders vain 
Presumptuous piled on Shinar’s plain. 
The rocky summits, split and rent, 
Formed turret, dome, or battlement, 
Or seemed fantastically set 
With cupola or minaret, 
Wild crests as pagod ever decked, 
Or mosque of Eastern architect. 
Nor were these earthborn castles bare, 
Nor lacked they many a banner fair; 205 
For, from their shivered brows displayed, 
Far o’er the unfathomable glade, 
All twinkling with the dewdrops sheen, 
The brier-rose fell in streamers green, 
And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, 210 
Waved in the west-wind’s summer sighs. 200 
xIr 
Boon nature scattered, free and wild, 
Each plant or flower, the mountain’s child. 
Here eglantine embalmed the air, 
Hawthorn and hazel mingled there; 
The primrose pale and violet flower 
Found in each cliff a narrow bower; 
Foxglove and nightshade, side by side, 
Emblems of punishment and pride, _—_219 
Grouped their dark hues with every stain 
The weather-beaten crags retain. 
With boughs that quaked at every breath, 
Gray birch and aspen wept beneath; 
Aloft, the ash and warrior oak 
Cast anchor in the rifted rock; 
And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung 
His shattered trunk, and frequent flung, 
Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, 
His boughs athwart the narrowed sky. 229 
Highest of all, where white peaks glanced, 215 
225 
.Where glist’ning streamers waved and 
danced,

Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face 
Could on the dark-blue mirror trace; 
And farther as the Hunter strayed, 
Still broader sweep its channels made. 245 
The shaggy mounds no longer stood, 
Emerging from entangled wood, 
But, wave-encircled, seemed to float, 
Like castle girdled with its moat; 
Yet broader floods extending still 250 
Divide them from their parent hill, 
Till each, retiring, claims to be 
An islet in an island sea.

And now, to issue from the glen, 
No pathway meets the wanderer’s ken, 255 
Unless he climb, with footing nice, 
A far projecting precipice. 
The broom’s tough roots his ladder made, 
The hazel saplings lent their aid; 
And thus an airy point he won, 260 
Where, gleaming with the setting sun, 
One burnished sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,’ 
Tn all her length far winding lay, 
With promontory, creek, and bay, 265 
And islands that, empurpled bright, 
Floated amid the livelier light, LEGEND AND HISTORY 
And mountains that like giants stand 
To sentinel enchanted land. 
High on the south, huge Benvenue 
Down to the lake in masses threw 
Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly

Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare. 270

From the steep promontory gazed 
The stranger, raptured and amazed, 279 
And, “What a scene were here,” he cried, 
“For princely pomp, or churchman’s pride! 
On this bold brow, a lordly tower; 
In that soft vale, a lady’s bower; 
On yonder meadow, far away, 
The turrets of a cloister gray; 
How blithely might the bugle-horn 
Chide, on the lake, the lingering morn! 
How sweet, at eve, the lover’s lute

mute!

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
How solemn on the ear would come 
The holy matin’s distant hum, 
While the deep peal’s commanding tone 
Should wake, in yonder islet lone, 295 
A sainted hermit from his cell, 
To drop a bead with every knell— 
And bugle, lute, and bell, and all, 
Should each bewildered stranger call 
To friendly feast and lighted hall. 300 
XVI 
“Blithe were it then to wander here! 
But now—beshrew yon nimble deer— 
Like that same hermit’s, thin and spare, 
The copse must give my evening fare; 
Some mossy bank my couch must be, 
Some rustling oak my canopy. 
Yet pass we that; the war and chase 
Give little choice of resting-place— 
A summer night, in greenwood spent, 
Were but tomorrow’s merriment; 310 
But hosts may in these wilds abound, 
Such as are better missed than found; 
To meet with Highland plunderers here 
Were worse than loss of steed or deer. 
Tam alone—my bugle-strain 
May call some straggler of the train; 
Or, fall the worst that may betide, 
Ere now this falchion has been tried.” 305 
315 
XVII 
But scarce again his horn he wound, 
When lo! forth starting at the sound, 
From underneath an aged oak, 
That slanted from the istet rock, 
A damsel guider of its way, 
A little skiff shot to the bay, 
That round the promontory steep 325 
Led its deep line in graceful sweep, 
Eddying, in almost viewless wave, 
The weeping willow-twig to lave, 
And kiss, with whispering sound and slow, 
The beach of pebbles bright as snow. 330 
The boat had touched this silver strand 
Just as the Hunter left his stand, 
And stood concealed amid the brake, 
To view this Lady of the Lake. 
The maiden paused, as if again 335 
She thought to catch the distant strain. 
With head upraised, and look intent, 
And eye and ear attentive bent, 
And locks flung back, and lips apart, 
Like monument of Grecian art, 340 320 295 
In listening mood, she seemed to stand, 
‘The guardian Naiad of the strand. 
XVUOI 
And ne’er did Grecian chisel trace 
A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace 
Of finer form or lovelier face! 345 
What though the sun, with ardent frown, 
Had slightly tinged her cheek with brown— 
The sportive toil, which, short and light, 
Had dyed her glowing hue so bright, 
Served too in hastier swell to show 350 
Short glimpses of a breast of snow. 
What though no rule of courtly grace 
To measured mood had trained her pace— < - 
A foot more light, a step more true, 
Ne’er from the heath-flower, dashed the 
dew; 355 
E’en the slight harebell raised its head, 
Elastic from her airy tread. 
What though upon her speech there hung 
The accents of the mountain tongue— 
Those silver sounds, so soft, so dear, 360 
The listener held his breath to hear! 
xIxX 
A chieftain’s daughter seemed the maid; 
Her satin snood her silken plaid, 
Her golden brooch, such birth betrayed. 
And seldom was a snood amid 365 
Such wild, toxuriant ringlets hid, 
Whose glossy black to shame might bring 
The plumage of the raven’s wing; 
And seldom o’er a breast so fair, 
Mantled a plaid with modest care, 370 
And never brooch the folds combined 
Above a heart more good and kind. 
Her kindness and her worth to spy, 
You need but gaze on Ellen’s eye; 
Not Katrine in her mirror blue 878 
Gives back the shaggy banks more true, 
Than every free-born glance confessed 
The guileless movements of her breast; 
Whether joy danced in her dark eye, 
Or woe or pity claimed a sigh, 380 
Or filial love was glowing there, _ 
Or meek devotion poured a prayer, 
Or tale of injury called forth 
The indignant spirit of the North. 
One only passion unrevealed, 
With maiden pride the maid concealed, 
Yet not less purely felt the flame— 
O, need I tell that passion’s name! 385

Impatient of the silent horn, 389 
Now on the gale her voice was borne— 
“Father!” she cried; the rocks around 
Loved to prolong the gentle sound. 
A while she paused, no answer came— 
“Malcolm, was thine the blast?” the name 
Less resolutely uttered fell, 395 
The echoes could not catch the swell. 
“A stranger I,” the Huntsman said, 
Advancing from the hazel shade. 
The maid, alarmed, with hasty oar, 309 
Pushed her light shallop from the shore, 
And when a space was gained between, 
, Closer she drew her bosom’s screen— 
So forth the startled swan would swing, 
So turn to prune his ruffled wing. 404 
Then safe, though fluttered and amazed, 
She paused, and on the stranger gazed. 
Not his the form, nor his the eye, 
That youthful maidens wont to fly. 
xxXIT 
On his bold visage middle age 
Had slightly pressed its signet sage, 410 
Yet had not quenched the open truth 
And fiery vehemence of youth; 
Forward and frolic glee was there, 
The will to do, the soul to dare, 414 
The sparkling glance, soon blown to fire, 
Of hasty love, or headlong ire. 
His limbs were cast in manly mold, 
For hardy sports or contest bold; 
And though in peaceful garb arrayed, 
And weaponless, except his blade, . 420 
His stately mien as well implied 
A highborn heart, a martial pride, 
As if a Baron’s crest he wore, - 
And sheathed in armor trod the shore. 
Slighting the petty need he showed, 425 
He told of his benighted road; . 
His ready speech flowed fair and free, 
In phrase of gentlest courtesy; - 
Yet seemed that tone and gesture bland 
Less used to sue than to command. 430

And, reassured, at length replied, 
That Highland halls were open still 
To wildered wanderers of the hill. ~

“Nor think you unexpected come 
To yon lone isle, our desert home; 
Before the heath had lost the dew, 
This morn, a couch was pulled for you; 
On yonder mountain’s purple head 
Have ptarmigan and heath-cock bled, 440 
And our broad nets have swept the mere, 
To furnish forth your evening cheer.” 
“Now, by the rood, my lovely maid, 
Your courtesy has erred,” he said; 
“No right have I to claim, misplaced, 435 
The welcome of expected guest. 446 
A wanderer, here by fortune tost, 
My way, my friends, my courser lost, 
I ne’er before, believe me, fair, 
Have ever drawn your mountain air, 450

“T well believe,” the maid replied, 
As her light skiff approached the side, 
“I well believe, that ne’er before 455 
Your foot has trod Loch Kaitrine’s shore; 
But yet, as far as yesternight, 
Old Allan-bane foretold your plight— 
A gray-haired sire, whose eye intent 
Was on the visioned future bent. 
He saw your steed, a dappled gray, 
Lie dead beneath the birchen way; 
Painted exact your form and mien, 
Your hunting suit of Lincoln green,

That falchion’s crooked blade and hilt,

THE LADY or THE LAKE 
The toil unwonted saw him try; 
For seldom, sure, if e’er before, _ 
His noble hand had grasped'an oar. 485 
Yet with main strength his strokes he drew, 
And o’er the lake the shallop flew; 
With heads erect, and whimpering cry, . 
The hounds behind their passage ply. 
Nor frequent does the bright oar break 
The dark’ning mirror of the lake, 491 
Until the rocky isle they reach, 
And moor their shallop on the beach.

The stranger viewed the shore around, 
?T was all so close-with copsewood bound, 
Nor track nor pathway might declare 496 
That human foot frequented there, 
Until the mountain-maiden showed 
A clambering, unsuspected road, 
That winded through the tangled screen, 
And opened on a narrow green, 501 
Where weeping birch and willow round 
With their long fibers swept the ground. 
Here, for retreat in dangerous hour, 
Some chief had framed a rustic bower. 505 
XXXVI 
It was a lodge of ample size, 
But strange of structure and device; 
Of such materials as, around, 
The workman’s hand had readiest found. 
Lopped of their boughs, their hoar trunks 
bared, 510 
And by the hatchet rudely squared, 
To give the walls their destined height, 
The sturdy oak and ash unite; 
While moss and clay and leaves combined 
To fence each crevice from the wind. 515 
The lighter pine-trees, overhead, 
Their slender length for rafters spread, 
And withered heath and rushes dry 
Supplied a russet canopy. 
Due westward, fronting to the green, 520 
A rural portico was seen, 
Aloft on native pillars borne, 
Of mountain fir with bark unshorn, 
Where Ellen’s hand had taught to twine 
The ivy and Idan vine, 525 
The clematis, the favored flower 
Which boasts the name of virgin-bower, 
And every hardy plant could bear

And enter the enchanted hall!” 530

“My hope, my heaven, my trust must be, 
My gentle guide, in following thee!” 535 
He crossed the threshold—and a clang 
Of angry steel that instant rang. 
To his bold brow his spirit rushed, 
But soon for vain alarm he blushed, 
When on the floor he saw displayed, : 540 
Cause of the din, a naked blade . 
Dropped from thesheath, that careless flung 
Upon a stag’s huge antlers swung; 
For all around, the walls to grace, 
Hung trophies of the fight or chase: 545 
A target there, a bugle here, 
A battle-ax, a hunting spear,

Few were the arms whose sinewy strength 
Sufficed to stretch it forth at length. 
And as the brand he poised and swayed, 
“T never knew but one,” he said, 565 
“Whose stalwart arm might brook to wield 
A blade like this in battlefield.” 
She sighed, then smiled and took the word: 
“You see the guardian champion’s sword;

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
XXXII 
The hall was cleared—the stranger’s bed 
Was there of mountain heather spread, 
Where oft a hundred guests had lain, + 
_And dreamed their forest sports again. 
But vainly did the heath-flower shed 670 
Its moorland fragrance round his head; 
Not Eillen’s spell had lulled to rest 
The fever of his troubled breast. 
In broken dreams the image rose 
Of varied perils, pains, and woes: 675 
His steed now flounders in the brake; 
Now sinks his barge upon the lake; 
Now leader of a broken host, : 
His standard falls, his honor’s lost. 679 
Then—from my couch may heavenly might 
Chase that worst phantom of the night! 
Again returned the scenes of youth, 
Of confident, undoubting truth; 
Again his soul he interchanged 684 
With friends whose hearts were long 
estranged. 
They come, in dim procession led, 
The cold, the faithless, and the dead; 
As warm éach hand, each brow as gay, 
As if they parted yesterday. 
And doubt distracts him at the view— seo 
O were his senses false or true? 
Dreamed he of death, or broken vow, 
Or is it all a vision now? 
XXXIV 
At length, with Ellen in a grove 
He seemed to walk, and speak of love; 695 
She listened with a blush and sigh; 
His suit was warm, his hopes were high. 
He sought her yielded hand to clasp, 
And a cold gauntlet met his grasp; 
The phantom’s sex was changed and gone, 
Upon its head a helmet shone; 701 
Slowly enlarged to giant size, 
With darkened cheek and threatening eyes, 
The grisly visage, stern and hoar, 
To Ellen still a likeness bore. 705 
He woke, and, panting with affright, 
Recalled the vision of the night. 
The hearth’s decaying brands were red, 
And deep and dusky luster shed, 
Half showing, half concealing, all 710 
The uncouth trophies of the hall. 
Mid those the stranger fixed his eye 
Where that huge falchion hung on high, 
And thoughts on thoughts, a countless 
throng, 299 
Rushed, chasing countless thoughts along, 
Until, the giddy whirl to cure, 716 
He rose, and sought the moonshine pure. 
XXXV- 
The wild-rose, eglantine, and broom 
Wasted around their rich perfume, 
The birch-trees wept in fragrant balm; 720 
The aspens slept beneath the calm; 
The silver light, with quivering glance, 
Played on the water’s still expanse— 
Wild were the heart whose passion’s sway 
Could rage beneath the sober ray! 725 
He felt its calm, that warrior guest, 
While thus he communed with his breast: 
“Why is it, at each turn I trace 
Some memory of that exiled race? 
- Can I not mountain-maiden spy, 730 
But she must bear the Douglas eye? 
Can I not view a Highland brand, 
But it must match the Douglas hand? .. 
Can I not frame a fevered dream, 
But still the Douglas is the theme? 735 
Pll dream no more—by manly mind. 
Not even in sleep is will resigned. 
My midnight orisons said o’er, 
Til turn to rest, and dream no more.” 
His midnight orisons he told, 740 
A prayer with every bead of gold, 
Consigned to heaven his cares and woes, 
And sunk in undisturbed repose, 
Until the heath-cock shrilly crew, 
And morning dawned on Benvenue. —745

you think reflect the poet’s love of animals. 
_ 5. Scott’s home, Abbotsford, was filled with 
trophies of Scottish life—the clans, the chase, 
and border warfare; the beautiful garden 
had in it trees, shrubs, and flowers—examples 
of practically everything that grows in Scot- 
land. Find passages that might apply to his 
own home and garden. 
6. Notice how much is added to the en- 
joyableness of the poem by its music—the 
meter, the rime, alliteration, and the choice 
of certain words the sounds of which enhance 
the ideas expressed. Choosing a passage of 
about ten lines, mark the syllables that receive 
stresses or accents. How many are in each 
line? Such a line is sometimes called iambic 
tetrameter. Why? (At the end of this book, 
under the heading “Index of Special Terms,” 
you will find many helpful definitions and 
illustrations of some of the terms mentioned 
above, such as meter, alliteration, stanza, 
figures of speech, etc.) Find examples that show 
by the rime that Scott probably pronounced 
certain words differently from the way you 
are accustomed to hearing them pronounced. 
Read stanza ut aloud to show the crescendo 
and diminuendo effect which is as pronounced 
as if it were a piece of music. Find lines that 
seem to you to be especially musical. Give 
examples showing that alliteration heightens 
the musical effect. Find lines in which the sentence order is transposed; why did the poet 
use this order? The poet uses figurative lan- 
guage to stimulate the reader’s imagination by 
suggestions; find examples of especially sug- 
gestive figures of speech.

His hand, reclined upon the wire, 
Seemed watching the awakening fire; 
So still he sat, as those who wait 60

Upon a rock with lichens wild, 
Beside him Ellen sat and smiled— 
Smiled she to see the stately drake 
Lead forth his fleet upon the lake, 
While her vexed spaniel, from the beach, 
Bayed at the prize beyond his reach? 71 
Yet tell me, then, the maid who knows, 
‘Why deepened on her cheek the rose? 
Forgive, forgive, Fidelity!

While yet be loitered on the spot, 
It seemed as Ellen marked him not; 
But when he turned him to the glade, 
One courteous parting sign she made; 85 
And after, oft the knight would say, 
That not when prize of festal day 
Was dealt him by the brightest fair, 
Who e’er wore jewel in her hair, 
So highly did his bosom swell 90 
As at that simple mute farewell. 
Now with a trusty mountain-guide, 
And his dark stag-hounds.by his side, 
He parts—the maid, unconscious still, 
Watched him wind slowly round the hill; 
But when his stately form was hid, 96

“Thy Malcolm! vain and selfish maid!”

“Not so had Malcolm idly hung 100

When deep the conscious maiden blushed; 
For of his clan, in hall and bower,

The Minstrel waked his harp—three times 
Arose the well-known martial chimes, 115 
And thrice their high, heroic pride 
In melancholy murmurs died.

Clasping his withered hands, he said,

Plucked a blue harebell from the ground— 
“For me, whose memory scarce conveys

Courtiers give place before the stride

And since, though outlawed, hath his hand 
Full sternly kept his mountain land. —_ 226

Four manned and masted barges grew, 
And, bearing downwards from Glengyle, 
Steered full upon the lonely isle: 336 
The point of Brianchoil they passed, 
And, to the windward as they cast, 
Against the sun they gave to shine 
The bold Sir Roderick’s bannered Pine. 
Nearer and nearer as they bear, 
Spears, pikes, and axes flash in air. | 
Now might you see the tartans brave, 
And plaids and plumage dance and wave; 
Now see the bonnets sink and rise, B45 
As his tough oar the rower plies; 
See, flashing at each sturdy stroke, 
The wave ascending into smoke; 
See the proud pipers on the bow, 
And mark the gaudy streamers flow 350 
From their loud chanters down, and sweep 
‘The furrowed bosom of the deep, 
As, rushing through the lake amain, 
They plied the ancient Highland strain.

Ever, as on they bore, more loud 
And louder rung the pibroch proud. 
At first the sound, by distance tame, 
Mellowed along the waters came, 
And, lingering long by cape and bay, 
Wailed every harsher note away, 3 
Then bursting bolder on the ear, 
The clan’s shrill Gathering they could hear; 
Those thrilling sounds, that call the migh 
Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight. 
Thick beat the rapid notes, as when _a¢. 
The mustering hundreds shake the glen, 
And hurrying at the signal dread, 
The battered earth returns their tread. 
Then prelude light, of livelier tone, 
Expressed their merry marching on, 37] 
Ere peal of closing battle rose, 
With mingled outery, shrieks, and blows; 
And mimic din of stroke and ward, 
As broadsword upon target jarred;

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
Condensed, the battle yelled amain; 
The rapid charge, the rallying shout, 
Retreat borne headlong into rout, 
And bursts of triumph, to declare 
Clan-Alpine’s conquest—all were there. 
Nor ended thus the strain; but slow 379 
. Sunk in a moan prolonged and low, 
And changed the conquering clarion swell, 
For wild lament o’er those that fell. 
XVI 
The war-pipes ceased; but lake and hill 
Were busy with their echoes still; 
And, when they slept, a vocal strain 
Bade their hoarse chorus wake again, 
While loud a, hundred clansmen raise 
‘Their voices in their Chieftain’s praise. 
Each boatman, bending to his oar, 
With measured sweep the burden bore, 
In such wild cadence as the breeze 
Makes through December’s leafless trees. 
The chorus first could Allan know, 395 
“Roderick Vich Alpine, ho! iro!” 
And near, and nearer as they rowed, 
Distinct the martial ditty flowed. 386

Reluctantly and slow, the maid 451

And, when a distant bugle rung, 
In the mid-path aside she sprung— 
“List, Allan-bane! From mainland cast 
T hear my father’s signal blast. 456 
Be ours,” she cried, “‘the skiff to guide, 
And waft him from the mountain side.” 
Then, like a sunbeam, swift and bright, 
She darted to her shallop light, 
And, eagerly while Roderick scanned, 
For her dear form, his mother’s band, 
The islet far behind her lay, 
And she had landed in the bay. 460

Some feelings are to mortals given 465 
With less of earth in them than heaven; 
And if there be a human tear 
From passion’s dross refined and clear, 
A tear so limpid and so neeek 
It would not stain an angel’s cheek, 
Tis that which pious fathers shed 
Upon a duteous daughier’s head! 
And as the Douglas to his breast 
His darling Ellen closely pressed, 
Such holy drops her tresses steeped, 475 
Though ’twas an hero’s eye that weeped. 
Nor while on Ellen’s faltering tongue 
Her filial welcomes crowded hung, 
Marked she, that fear, affection’s proof, 
Still held a graceful youth aloof; 
No! not till Douglas named his name, 
Although the youth was Malcolm Greme. 470

Allan, with wistful look the while, 
Marked Roderick landing on the isle; 
His master piteously he eyed, 
Then gazed upon the Chieftain’s pride, 
Then dashed with hasty hand away 
From his dimmed eye the gathering spray; 
And Douglas, as his hand he laid 
On Malcoim’s shoulder, kindly said, - 490 
“Canst thou, young friend, no meaning spy 
In my poor follower’s glistening eye?

Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud 
Was I of all that marshaled crowd, 
Though the waned crescent owned my 
might, 504 
And in my train trooped lord and knight, 
Though Biantyre hymned her holiest lays,

A welcome give more kind and true

Oh! it out-beggars all I lost!” 510

And, at her whistle, on her hand

THE LADY OF THE ‘LAKE 
Trained to the chase, his eagle eye 
The ptarmigan in snow could spy; 
Each pass, by mountain, lake, and heath, 
He knew, through Lennox and Menteith; 
Vain was the bound of dark-brown doe 
When Malcolm bent his sounding bow, 545. 
And scarce that doe, though winged with 
fear, 
Outstripped in speed the mountaineer; 
Right up Ben-Lomond could he press, 
And not a sob his toil confess. 
His form accorded with a mind 540 
550 
Lively and ardent, frank and kind; 
A blither heart, till Ellen came, 
Did never love nor sorrow tame; 
It danced as lightsome in his breast, . 
As played the feather on his crest. 555 
Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth, 
His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth, 
And bards, who saw his features bold, 
When kindled by the tales of old, 559 
Said, were that youth to manhood grown, 
Not long should Roderick Dhu’s renown 
Be foremost voiced by mountain fame, 
But quail to that of Malcolm Greme. 
XXVI 
Now back they wend their watery way, © 
And, “‘O my sire!’’ did Ellen say, 565 
“Why urge thy chase so far astray? 
And why so late returned? And why”’— 
The rest was in her speaking eye. 
“My child, the chase I follow far, 
*Tis mimicry of noble war; 
And with that gallant pastime reft 
Were all of Douglas I have left. 
I met young Malcolm as I strayed 
Far eastward, in Glenfinlas’ shade, 
Nor strayed I safe; for, all around, 575 
Hunters and horsemen scoured the ground. 
This youth,.though still a royal ward, 
Risked life and land to be my guard, 
And through the passes of the wood 
Guided my steps, not unpursued; 
And Roderick shall his welcome make, 
Despite old spleen, for Douglas’ sake. 
Then must he seek Strath-Endrick glen, 
Nor peril aught for me again.” 570

Reddened at sight of Malcolm Graeme, 
588. Strath-Endrick, Me utheast of Loch Lomond, evidently Malcolm's home: ° 307 
Yet, not in action, word, or eye, 
Failed aught in hospitality. 
In talk and sport they whiled away 
The morning of that summer day; 590 
But at high noon a courier light 
Held secret parley with the knight, 
Whose moody aspect soon declared 
That evil were the news he heard. 
Deep thought seemed toiling in his head; 
Yet was the evening banquet made, _596 
Ere he assembled round the flame 
His mother, Douglas, and the Greeme, 
And Ellen, too; then cast around 
His eyes, then fixed them on the ground, 
As studying phrase that might avail 601 
Best to convey unpleasant tale. 
Long with his dagger’s hilt he played, 
Then raised his haughty brow, and said:

“Short be my speech—nor time affords, 
Nor my plain temper, glozing words. 606

Douglas vouchsafe to Roderick’s claim;

Full soon a noble friend or foe,

And when the banquet they prepared, 620 
And wide their loyal portals flung, 
O’er their own gateway struggling hung.

From Yarrow braes, and banks of Tweed, 
Where the lone streams of Ettrick glide, 
And from the silver Teviot’s side; 626

Are now one sheepwalk, waste and wide.

So faithless, and so ruthless known, 
Now hither comes; his end the same, 
The same pretext of silvan game. 630

XxIX 
Ellen and Margaret fearfully 
Sought comfort in each other’s eye, 640 
Then turned their ghastly look, each one, 
This to her sire, that to her son. 
The hasty color went and came 
In the bold cheek of Malcolm Greeme; 
But from his glance it well appeared, 645 
*Twas but for Ellen that he feared; 
While, sorrowful, but undismayed, 
The Douglas thus his counsel said: 
“Brave Roderick, though the tempest roar, 
- It may but thunder and pass o’er; 650 
Nor will I here remain an hour, 
To draw the lightning on thy bower; 
For well thou know’st, at this gray head 
The royal bolt were fiercest sped. 
For thee, who, at thy King’s command, 655 
Canst aid him with a gallant band, 
Submission, homage, humbled pride, 
Shall turn the Monarch’s wrath aside. 
Poor remnants of the Bleeding Heart, 
Ellen and I will seek, apart, 660 
The refuge of some forest cell, 
There, like the hunted quarry, dwell, 
Till on the mountain and the moor, 
The stern pursuit be passed and o’er.” 
Xxx 
“No, by mine honor,” Roderick said, 665 
“So help me Heaven, and my good blade! 
No, never! Blasted be yon Pine, 
My fathers’ ancient crest and mine, 
If from its shade in danger part 
The lineage of the Bleeding Heart! 670 
Hear my blunt speech: Grant me this maid 
To wife, thy counsel to mine aid; 
To Douglas, leagued with Roderick Dhiu, 
Will friends and allies flock enow; 
Like cause of doubt, distrust, and grief 
Will bind to us each Western Chief. 676

Small need of inroad, or of fight, 
When the sage Douglas may unite 
Each mountain clan in friendly band, 
To guard the passes of their land,

There are who have, at midnight hour, 
In slumber scaled a dizzy tower, 
And, on the verge that beetled o’er 
The ocean tide’s incessant roar, 695 
Dreamed calmly out their dangerous dream, 
Till wakened by the morning beam; 
When, dazzled by the eastern glow, 
Such startler cast his glance below, 
And saw unmeasured depth around, 
And heard unintermitted sound, 
And thought the battled fence so frail, 
It waved like cobweb in the gale; 
Amid his senses’ giddy wheel, _ 
Did he not desperate impulse feel, 
Headlong to plunge himself below, 
And meet the worst his fears foreshow? 
Thus, Ellen, dizzy and astound, . 
As sudden ruin yawned around, 
By crossing terrors wildly tossed, 
Still for the Douglas fearing most, 
Could scarce the desperate thought with~- 
stand, 
To buy’ his safety with her hand. 
XXXII 
Such purpose dread could Malcolm spy 
In Ellen’s quivering lip and eye, 
And eager rose to speak—but ere 
His tongue could hurry forth his fear, 
Had Douglas marked the hectic strife, 
Where death seemed combating with life; 
For to her cheek, in feverish flood, 720 
One instant rushed the throbbing blood, 
Then ebbing back, with sudden sway, 
Left its domain as wan as clay. 
“Roderick, enough! enough!” he cried, 
“My daughter cannot be thy bride; 
Not that the blush to wooer dear, 
Nor paleness that of maiden fear. 
It may not be—forgive her, Chief, 
Nor hazard aught for our relief. 700

To rein a steed and wield a brand; 
I see him yet, the princely boy!

By hasty wrath, and slanderous tongues. 
O seek the grace you well may find, 
Without a cause to mine combined.”

Twice through the hall the Chieftain 
strode; 
The waving of his tartans broad, TAL 
And darkened brow, where wounded pride 
With ire and disappointment vied, 
Seemed, by the torch’s gloomy light, 
Like the ill Demon of the night, 745 
Stooping his pinions’ shadowy sway 
Upon the nighted pilgrim’s way; 
But, unrequited Love! thy dart 
Plunged deepest its envenomed smart, 
And Roderick, with thine anguish stung, * 
At length the hand of Douglas wrung, 751 
While eyes, that mocked at tears before, 
With bitter drops were running o’er. 
The death-pangs of long-cherished hope 
Scarce in that ample breast had scope, 755 
But, struggling with his spirit proud, 
Convulsive heaved its checkered shroud, 
While every sob—so mute were all— 
Was heard distinctly through the hall. 
The son’s despair, the mother’s look, 
Ill might the gentle Ellen brook; 
She rose, and to her side there came, 
To aid her parting steps, the Greeme. 
XXXIV 
Then Roderick from the Douglas broke— 
As flashes flame through sable smoke, 765 
Kindling its wreaths, long, dark, and low, 
To one broad blaze of ruddy glow, 
So the deep anguish of despair 
Burst, in fierce jealousy, to air. . 
With stalwart grasp his hand he laid 770 
On Malcolm’s breast and belted plaid: 
“Back, beardless boy!” he sternly said, 
“Back, minion! hold’st thou thus at naught 
The lesson I so lately taught? 
This roof, the Douglas, and that maid, 775 
Thank thou for punishment delayed.” 
Eager as greyhound on his game ‘760 
787. its checkered shroud, his plaid. 309 
Fiercely with Roderick grappled Graeme 
“Perish my name, if aught afford / 
Its Chieftain’s safety save his sword!” 780 
Thus as they strove, their desperate hand 
Griped to the dagger or the brand, 
And death had been—but Douglas rose; 
And thrust between the struggling foes © 
His giant strength: “Chieftains, forego! 
I hold the first who strikes, my foe. 
Madmen, forbear your frantic jar! 
What! is the Douglas fall’n so far, 
His daughter’s hand is deemed: the spoil 
Of such dishonorable broil!” 790 
Sullen and slowly they unclasp, 
As struck with shame, their desperate 786 
grasp, 
And each upon his rival glared, - 
With foot advanced, and blade half bared. 
XXXV 
Ere yet the brands aloft were flung, 
Margaret on Roderick’s mantle hung, 
And Malcolm heard his Ellen’s scream, 
As faltered through terrific dream. 
Then Roderick plunged in sheath his sword 
And veiled his wrath in scornful word: 800 
“Rest safe till morning; pity ’twere 
Such cheek should feel the midnight air! 
Then mayest thou to James Stuart tell, 
Roderick will keep the lake and fell, 
Nor lackey, with his freeborn clan, 
The pageant pomp of earthly man. 
More would he of Clan-Alpine know, 
Thou canst our strength and passes show. 
Malise, what ho!”—his henchman came; 
“Give our safe-conduct to the Graeme.” 810 
Young Malcolm answered, calm and bold, | 
“Fear nothing for thy favorite hold; 
The spot an angel deigned to grace 
Is blessed, though robbers haunt the place. 
Thy churlish courtesy for those 815 
Reserve, who fear to be thy foes.

At midnight as in blaze of day, 
Though with his boldest at his back 
Even Roderick Dhu beset the track. 820

Naught here of parting will I say.

Much were the peril to the Greme 
From those who to the signal came; 
Far up the lake ’twere safest land; 835

He gave his counsel to the wind, 
While Malcolm did, unheeding, bind,

His ample plaid in tightened fold, 3840

As best might suit the watery way— -

Then spoke abrupt: “Farewell to thee,

The Minstrel’s hand he kindly pressed—. 
“Oh, could I point a place of rest! 846

My uncle leads my vassal band; 
To tame his foes, his friends to aid, 
Poor Malcolm has but heart and blade. 
Yet, if there be one faithful Greeme — 851

Not long shall honored Douglas dwell

I may not give the rest to air! 856

Not the poor service of a boat, 
To waft me to yon mountain-side.” 
Then plunged he in the flashing tide. _860 
Bold o’er the flood his head he bore, 
And stouily steered him from the shore; 
And Allan strained his anxious eye, 
Far mid the lake his form to spy, 
Darkening across each puny wave, 
To which the moon her silver gave. 
Fast as the cormorant could skim,

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1, Sir Walter Scott in this poem gives ex- 
pression to his own feeling that there is some- 
thing mysterious about the music of the harp; 
find passages in both Cantos First and Second 
that make the reader feel that the harp is 
inspired. 
2. Canto First was full of action, and as we 
followed the hunt we became acquainted with 
the scene of the story, its lakes and mountains; 
Canto Second, on the other hand, deals rather 
with human feelings and emotions, and we 
learn to know the characters in the story better. 
Name the persons in the poem and tell what 
you learned about their relations to each other. 
From the conversation between Ellen and 
Allan-bane, what did you learn about Ellen, 
the Douglas family, and Roderick Dhu? Find 
lines describing the departing guest, Allan- 
bane, Ellen, Lady Margaret and her band, 
Roderick Dhu, The Douglas, Malcolm Graeme. 
Which character is described the most vividly? 
Find lines pertaining to Roderick that make the _ 
reader realize that Ellen cannot respect him. 
Find lines that influence the reader’s liking for 
Malcolm. What have you learned, from this 
Canto and Canto First, about the hospitality 
of the Highlanders? Can you discover espe- 
cially vivid descriptive lines? See, for example, 
stanzas xiv, XvI, etc.

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
CANTO THIRD 
Tur GATHERING 
I 
Time rolls his ceaseless course. 
- of yore, 
Who danced our infancy upon their knee, 
And told our marveling boyhood legends The race 
store 
Of their strange ventures happed by land 
or sea, 
How are they blotted from the things that 
be! - 8 
How few, all weak and withered of their 
force, 
Wait on the verge of dark eternity, 
Like stranded wrecks, the tide returning 
hoarse, 
To_sweep them from our sight! Time rolls 
his ceaseless course. 
Yet live there still who can remember well 
How, when a mountain chief his bugle 
blew, u 
Both field and forest, dingle, cliff, and dell, 
And solitary heath, the signal knew; 
And fast the faithful clan around him 
. drew, 
‘What time the warning note was keenly 
wound, 15 
What time aloft their kindred banner flew, 
While clamorous war-pipes yelled the 
gathering sound, 
And while the Fiery Cross glanced, like a 
meteor, round. 
I 
The summer dawn’s reflected hue 
To purple changed Loch Katrine blue; 20 
Mildly and soft the western breeze 
Just kissed the lake, just stirred the trees, 
And the pleased lake, like maiden coy, 
Trembled but dimpled not for joy; 
The mountain-shadows on her breast 25 
Were neither broken nor at rest; 
In bright uncertainty they lie, 
Like future joys to Fancy’s eye. 
The water-lily to the light 
Her chalice reared of silver bright; 30 
The doe awoke, and to the lawn, 
Begemmed with dewdrops, led her fawn; 
The gray mist left the mountain-side; 
The torrent showed its glistening pride; - $11 
Invisible in fleckéd sky, 35 
The lark sent down her revelry; 
The blackbird and the speckled thrush 
Good-morrow gave from brake and bush; 
In answer cooed the cushat dove : 
Her notes of peace, and rest, and love. 40 
mm 
No thought of peace, no thought of rest, 
Assuaged the storm in Roderick’s breast. 
With sheathéd broadsword in his hand, 
Abrupt he paced the islet strand, 
And eyed the rising sun, and laid 45 
His hand on his impatient blade. 
Beneath a rock, his vassals’ care 
Was prompt the ritual to prepare, 
With deep and deathful meaning fraught; 
For such Antiquity had taught 50 
Was preface meet, ere yet abroad - 
The Cross of Fire should take its road. 
The shrinking band stood oft aghast 
At the impatient glance he cast— 
Such-glance the mountain eagie threw, 55 
As, from the cliffs of Benvenue, 
She spread her dark sails on the wind, 
And, high in middle heaven reclined, 
With her broad shadow on the lake, 
Silenced the warblers of the brake. 60 
Iv 
A heap of withered boughs was piled, 
Of juniper and rowan wild, 
Mingled with shivers from the oak, 
Rent by the lightning’s recent stroke. 
Brian, the Hermit, by it stood, 65 
Barefooted, in his frock and hood. 
His grizzled beard and matted ‘hair 
Obscured a visage of despair; 
His naked arms and legs, seamed o’er, 
The scars of frantic penance bore. 70 
That monk, of savage form and face, 
The impending danger of his race 
Had drawn from deepest solitude, 
Far in Benharrow’s bosom rude. 
Not his the mien of Christian priest, 15 
But Druid’s, from the grave released, 
Whose hardened heart and eye might brook 
On human sacrifice to look; 
And much, ’twas said, of heathen lore 
Mixed in the charms he muttered o’er. 80 
The hallowed creed gave only worse 
63, shivers, splinters. 74. Benharrow, a mountain near Loch Lomond. ‘81. hallowed creed, Christianity.

And deadlier emphasis of curse; 
No peasant sought that Hermit’s prayer, 
His cave the pilgrim shunned with care, 
The eager huntsman knew his bound, 85 
And in mid chase called off his hound; 
Or if, in lonely glen or strath, 
The desert-dweller met his path, : 
He prayed, and signed the cross between, 
While terror took devotion’s mien. 90 
v 
Of Brian’s birth strange tales were told. 
His mother watched a midnight fold, 
Built deep within a dreary glen, 
Where scattered lay the bones of men, 
In some forgotten battle slain, 95 
And bleached by drifting wind and rain. 
It might have tamed a warrior’s heart 
To view such mockery of his art! 
The knotgrass fettered there the hand 
Which once could burst an iron band; 100 
Beneath the broad and ample borie, 
That bucklered heart to fear unknown, 
A feeble and a timorous guest, 
The fieldfare framed her lowly nest; 104 
There the slow blindworm left his slime 
On the fleet limbs that mocked at time; 
And there, too, lay the leader’s skull, 
Still wreathed with chaplet, flushed and full, 
For heath-bell with her purple bloom 
Supplied the bonnet and the plume. 
All night, in this sad glen, the maid , 
Sat, shrouded in her mantle’s shade; 
She said no shepherd sought her side, 
No hunter’s hand her snood untied; 
Yet ne’er again to braid her hair 
The virgin snood did Alice wear; 
Gone was her maiden glee and sport, 
Her maiden girdle all too short, 
Nor sought she, from that fatal night, 
Or holy church or blessed rite, 
But locked her secret in her breast, 
And died in travail, unconfessed. 110 
115 
120 
VI 
Alone, among his young compeers, 
Was Brian from his infant years; 
A moody and heartbroken boy, 
’ Estranged from sympathy and joy, 
Bearing each taunt which careless tongue 
On his mysterious lineage flung. 
Whole nights he spent by moonlight pale, 125

To wood and stream his hap to wail, 130 
Till, frantic, he as truth received 
What of his birth the crowd believed, 
And sought, in mist and meteor fire, 
To meet and know his Phantom Sire! 
In vain, to sooth his wayward fate, 135 
The cloister oped her pitying gate; 
In vain, the learning of the age 
Unclasped the sable-lettered page; 
Even in its treasures he could find 
Food for the fever of his mind. 140 
Eager he read whatever tells 
Of magic, cabala, and spells, 
And every dark pursuit allied 
To curious and presumptuous pride; 
Till with fired brain and nerves o’erstrung, 
And heart with mystic horrors wrung, 146 
Desperate he sought Benharrow’s den, 
And hid him from the haunts of men. 
VIL 
‘The desert gave him visions wild, 
Such as might suit the specter’s child. 150 
Where with black cliffs the torrents toil, 
He watched the wheeling eddies boil, 
Till, from their foam, his dazzled eyes 
Beheld the River Demon rise; 154 
The mountain mist took form and limb 
Of noontide hag or goblin grim; 
The midnight wind came wild and dread, 
Swelled with the voices of the dead; 
Far on the future battle-heath 
His eyes beheld the ranks of death. 160 
Thus the Jone Seer, from mankind hurled, 
Shaped forth a, disembodied world. 
One lingering sympathy of mind 
Still bound him to the mortal kind; 
The only parent he could claim 165 
Of ancient Alpine lineage came. 
Late had he heard, in prophet’s dream, 
The fatal Ben-Shie’s boding scream; 
Sounds, too, had come in midnight blast 
Of charging steeds, careering fast 170 
Along Benharrow’s shingly side, 
Where mortal horseman ne’er might ride; 
The thunderbolt had split the pine— 
All angured ill to Alpine’s line. 
He girt his loins, and came to show 175 
The signals of impending woe, 
And now stood prompt to bless or ban, 
As bade the Chieftain of his clan.

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
VIIr 
*Twas all prepared—and from the rock, 
A goat, the patriarch of the flock, 180 
Before the kindling pile was laid, 
And pierced by Roderick’s ready blade. 
Patient the sickening victim eyed 
The lifeblood ebb in crimson tide 184 
Down his clogged beard and shaggy limb, 
Till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim. 
The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer, 
A slender crosslet formed with care, 
A cubit’s length in measure due; 
The shaft-and limbs were rods of yew, 190 
Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach wave 
Their shadows o’er Clan-Alpine’s grave, 
And, answering Lomond’s breezes deep, 
Soothe many a chieftain’s endless sleep. 
The Cross, thus formed, he held on high, 
With wasted hand and haggard eye, 196 
And strange and mingled feelings woke, 
While his anathema he spoke: 
x 
“Woe to the clansman who shall view 
This symbol of sepulchral yew, 200 
Forgetful that its branches grew 
Where weep the heavens their holiest dew 
On Alpine’s dwelling low! 
Deserter of his Chieftain’s trust, 
He ne’er shall mingle with their dust, 205 
But, from his sires and kindred thrust, 
Each clansman’s execration just 
Shall doom him wrath and woe.” 
He paused—the word the vassals took, 
With forward step and fiery look; 210 
On high their naked brands they shook; 
Their clattering targets wildly strook; 
And first in murmur low, 
Then, like the billow in his course, 
That far to seaward finds his source, 215 
And flings to shore his mustered force, 
Burst, with loud roar, their answer hoatse, © 
“Woe to the traitor, woe!” 
Ben-an’s gray scalp the accents knew; 
The joyous wolf from covert drew; 220 
The exulting eagle screamed afar— 
They knew the voice of Alpine’s war. 
x 
The shout was hushed on lake and fell, 
The Monk resumed his muttered spell; 
ug, Jach-Caillloch, the Isle of Nuns in Loch Lomond, 
as the urial-ground. 200, iehral, s0- called because the yew iscommonin bburial-grounds, 212, 313 
Dismal and low its accents came, 225 
The while he scathed the Cross with flame; 
And the few words that reached the air, 
Although the holiest name was there, 
Had more of ‘blasphemy than prayer. 
But when he shook above the crowd 230 
Its kindled points, he spoke aloud: 
“Woe to the wretch who fails to rear 
At this dread sign the ready spear! 
For, as the flames this symbol sear, 
His home, the refuge of his fear, 235 
A kindred fate shall know; 
Far o’er its roof the volumed flame 
Clan-Alpine’s vengeance shall proclaim, 
While maids and matrons on his name 
Shall call down wretchedness and shame, 
And infamy and woe.” 241 
Then rose the cry of females, shrill 
As goshawk’s whistle on the hill, 
Denouncing misery and ill, 
Mingled with childhood’s babbling trill 
Of curses stammered slow; 246 
Answering, with imprecation dread, 
“Sunk be his home in embers red! 
And curséd be the meanest shed 
That e’er shall hide the houseless head 250 
We doom to want and woe!” 
A sharp and shrieking echo gave, 
Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave! 
And the gray pass where birches wave 
On Beala-nam-bo. 255 
XI 
Then deeper pauséd the priest anew, 
And hard his laboring breath he drew, 
While, with set teeth and clenchéd hand, 
And eyes that glowed like fiery brand, 
He meditated curse more dread, 260 
And deadlier, on the clansman’s head, 
Who, summoned to his chieftain’s aid, 
The signal saw and disobeyed. 
The crosslet’s points of sparkling wood. 
He quenched among the bubbling blood, 
And, as again the sign he reared, . 266 
Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard: 
“When flits this Cross from man to man, 
Vich-Alpine’s summons to his clan, 
Burst be the ear that fails to heed! 270 
Palsied the foot that shuns to speed! 
May ravens tear the careless eyes,

‘Wolves make the coward heart their prize! 
As sinks that blood-stream in the earth, 
So may his heart’s blood drench his hearth! 
As dies in hissing gore the spark, 276 
Quench thou his light, Destruction dark! 
And be the grace to him denied, 
Bought by this sign to all beside!” 
He ceased; no echo gave again 280 
The murmur of the deep Amen. 
xi 
Then Roderick, with impatient look, 
From Brian’s hand the symbol took; 
“Speed, Malise, speed!’ he said, and gave 
The crosslet to his henchman brave. —_ 285 
“The muster-place be Lanrick mead— 
Instant the time—speed, Malise, speed!” 
Like heath-bird, when the hawks pursue, 
A barge across Loch Katrine flew; 
High stood the henchman on the prow; 
So rapidly the barge-men row, 291 
The bubbles, where they launched the boat, 
Were all unbroken and afloat, 
Dancing in foam and ripple still, 
When it had neared the mainland hill; 295 
And from the silver beach’s side 
Still was the prow three fathom wide, 
When lightly bounded to the land 
The messenger of blood and brand.

Speed, Malise, speed! the dun deer’s hide 
On fleeter foot was never tied. 301 
Speed, Malise, speed! such cause of haste 
Thine active sinews never braced. 
Bend ’gainst the steepy hill thy breast, 
Burst down like torrent from its crest; 305 
With short and springing footstep pass 
The trembling bog and false morass; 
Across the brook like roebuck bound, 
And thread the brake like questing hound; 
The crag is high, the scar is deep, 310 
Yet shrink not from the desperate leap; 
Parched are thy burning lips and brow, 
Yet by the fountain pause not now; 
Herald of battle, fate, and fear, 
Stretch onward in thy fleet career! B15 
The wounded hind thou track’st not now 
Pursuest not maid through greenwood 
bough, 
Nor pliest thou now thy flying pace 
With rivals in the mountain race; 
But danger, death, and warrior deed 329 
* Are in thy course—speed, Malise, speed! LEGEND AND HISTORY 
xIv 
Fast as the fatal symbol flies, 
In arms the huts and hamlets rise; 
From winding glen, from upland brown, 
They poured each hardy tenant down. 325 
Nor slacked the messenger his pace; 
He showed the sign, he named the place, 
And, pressing forward like the wind, 
Left clamor and surprise behind. 
The fisherman forsook the strand, 330 
The swarthy smith took dirk and brand; 
With changéd cheer the mower blithe 
Left in the half-cut swath the scythe; 
The herds without a keeper strayed, 
The plow was in mid-furrow stayed, 335 
The fale’ner tossed his hawk away, 
The hunter left the stag at bay; 
Prompt at the signal of alarms, 
Each son of Alpine rushed to arms; 
So swept the tumult and affray 340 
Along the margin of Achray. 
Alas, thou lovely lake! that e’er 
Thy banks should echo sounds of fear! 
The rocks, the bosky thickets, sleep 
So stilly on thy bosom deep, 345 
The lark’s blithe carol from the cloud 
Seems for the scene too gaily loud. 
xV 
Speed, Malise, speed! the lake is past; 
Duncraggan’s huts appear at last, 
And peep, like moss-grown rocks; half seen, 
Half hidden in the copse so green; 351 
There mayst thou rest, thy labor done, 
Their lord shall speed the signal on. 
As stoops the hawk upon his prey, 
The henchman shot him down the way. 355 
—What woeful accents load the gale? 
The funeral yell, the female wail! 
A gallant hunter’s sport is o’er, 
A valiant warrior fights no more. 
Who, in the battle or the chase, 360 
At Roderick’s side shall fill his place!— 
Within the hall, where torches’ ray 
Supplies the excluded beams of day, 
Lies Duncan on his lowly bier, 
And o’er him streams his widow’s tear. 265 
His stripling son stands mournful by, 
His youngest weeps, but knows not why; 
The village maids and matrons round 
The dismal coronach resound.

In haste the stripling to his side 
His father’s dirk and broadsword tied; 
But when he saw his mother’s eye 
Watch him in speechless agony, 4 
Back to her opened arms he flew, 
‘Pressed on her lips a fond adieu— 
“Alas!” she sobbed—“and yet be gone, 
And speed thee forth, like Duncan’s son!” 
One look he cast upon the bier, 420 
Dashed from his eye the gathering tear, 
Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast, 
And tossed aloft his bonnet crest, 
Then, like the high-bred colt, when, freed, 
First he essays his fire and speed, 425 
_ He vanished, and o’er moor and moss 
Sped forward with the Fiery Cross. 
Suspended was the widow’s tear 
While yet his footsteps she could hear; 
And when she marked the henchman’s eye 
Wet with unwonted sympathy, 431 
“Kinsman,” she said, “his race is run 
That should have sped thine errand on; 
The oak has fallen—the sapling bough 
Is all Duncraggan’s shelter now. 435 
Yet trust I well, his duty done, 
The orphan’s God will guard my son. 
And you, in many a danger true, 
At Duncan’s hest your blades that drew,

Resounded through the funeral hail, 
While from the walls the attendant band 
Snatched sword and targewith hurried hand; 
And short and flitting energy 446 
Glanced from the mourner’s sunken eye, 
As if the sounds to warrior dear 
Might rouse her Duncan from his bier. 
But faded soon that borrowed force; 450 
Grief claimed his right, and tears their 
course.

Benledi saw the Cross of Fire; 
It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire. 
O’er dale and hill the summons flew; 
Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew; 455

He left the mountain breeze to dry; 
Until, where Teith’s young waters roll

That graced the sable strath with green,

The chapel of St. Bride was seen. 461 
Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge, 
But Angus paused not on the edge; 
Though the dark waves danced dizzily, 
Though reeled his sympathetic eye, 465 
He dashed amid the torrent’s roar. 
His right hand high the crosslet bore, 
His left the pole-ax grasped, to guide 
And stay his footing in the tide. 460 
Hestumbled twice—the foam splashed high; 
With hoarser swell the stream raced by; 
And had he fall’n—forever there, 
Farewell Duncraggan’s orphan heir! 
But still, as if in parting life, 
Firmer he grasped the Cross of strife, 475 
Until the opposing bank he gained, 
And up the chapel pathway strained.

Had sought the chapel of St. Bride.

And, issuing from the Gothic arch 
The bridal now resumed their march. 
In rude but glad procession came 
Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame; 485 
And plaided youth, with jest and jeer, 
Which snooded maiden would not hear; 
And children, that, unwitting why, 
Lent the gay shout their shrilly ery; 
And minstrels, that in measures vied 490 
Before the young and bonny bride, 
Whose downcast eye.and cheek disclose 
‘The tear and blush of morning rose. 
With virgin step and bashful hand

And, lingering, eyed his lovely bride, 
Until he saw the starting tear

In haste he sped him up the brook, 
Nor backward glanced, till on the heath 
Where Lubnaig’s lake supplies the Teith. 
—What in the racer’s bosom stirred? 
The sickening pang of hope deferred, 
And memory with a torturing train 
Of all his morning visions vain. 
Mingled with love’s impatience came 
The manly thirst for martial fame; 
The stormy joy of mountaineers, 
Ere yet they rush upon the spears; 
And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning, 
And hope, from well-fought field returning, 
With war’s red honors on his crest, 
To clasp his Mary to his breast. 540

Alarmed, Balvaig, thy swampy course; 580 
Thence southward turned its rapid road 
Adown Strath-Gartney’s valley broad, 
Till rose in arms each man might claim 
A portion in Clan-Alpine’s name, 584 
From the gray sire, whose trembling hand 
Could hardly buckle on his brand, 
To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow 
Were yet scarce terror to the crow. 
Each valley, each sequestered glen, 
Mustered its little horde of men, 
That met as torrents from the height 
In Highland dales their streams unite, 
Still gathering, as they pour along, 
A voice more loud, a tide more strong, 
Till at the rendezvous they stood 595 
By hundreds, prompt for blows and blood, 
Fach trained to arms since life began, 
Owning no tie but to his clan, 
No oath but by his chieftain’s hand, 
No law but Roderick Dhu’s command.

All backward came with news of truce: 605 
Still lay each martial Greeme and Bruce; 
In Rednoch courts no horsemen wait; 
No banner waved on Cardross gate; 
On Duchray’s towers no beacon shone, 
Nor seared the herons from Loch Con— 
All seemed at peace. Now wot ye why 611 
The Chieftain, with such anxious eye, 
Ere to the muster he repair, + 
This western frontier scanned with care? 
In Benvenue’s most darksome cleft, 615 
A fair, though cruel, pledge was left; 
For Douglas, to his promise true, 
‘That morning from the isle withdrew, 
-And in a deep sequestered dell 
Had sought a low and lonely cell.

Has Coir-nan-Uriskin been sung; 
A softer name the Saxons gave, 
And called the grot the Goblin-cave. 620

It was a wild and strange retreat 
As e’er was trod by outlaw’s feet. 
The dell, upon the mountain’s crest, 
Yawned like a gash on warrior’s breast; 
Its trench had stayed full many a rock, 
Hurled by primeval earthquake shock 630

With such a glimpse as prophet’s eye

No murmur waked the solemn still, 
Save tinkling of a fountain rill; : 
But when the wind chafed with the lake, 
A sullen sound would upward break, 
With dashing hollow voice, that spoke 645

Seemed nodding o’er the cavern gray.

In such the wildcat leaves her young; 650

Now eve, with western shadows long, 
Floated on Katrine bright and strong, 660 
When Roderick, with a chosen few, 
Repassed the heights of Benvenue. 
Above the Goblin-cave they go, 
Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo; 
The prompt retainers speed before, 665 
To launch the shallop from the shore, 
For ’cross Loch Katrine lies his way 
To view the passes of Achray, 
And place his clansmen in array. 
Yet lags the chief in musmg mind, 870 
Unwonted sight, his men behind. 
A single page, to bear his sword, 
Alone attended on his lord; 
The rest their way through thickets break, 
And soon await him by the lake. 675 
It was a fair and gallant sight, 
To view them from the neighboring height, 
By the low-leveled sunbeam’s light! 
For strength and stature, from the clan 
Each warrior was a chosen man, 680 
As even afar might well be seen, 
By their proud step and martial mien. 
Their feathers dance, their tartans float, 
Their targets gleam, as by the boat 
A wild and warlike group they stand, 685 
That well became such mountain-strand. 
XXVIII 
Their Chief, with step reluctant, still 
Was lingering on the craggy hill, 
Hard by where turned apart the road 
To Douglas’s obscure abode. 690 
It was but with that dawning morn 
That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn 
To drown his love in war’s wild roar, 
Nor think of Ellen Douglas more; 
But he who stems a stream with sand, 695 
And fetters flame with flaxen band, 
Has yet a harder task to prove— 
By firm resolve to conquer love! 
Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost, LEGEND AND HISTORY 
Still hovering near his treasure lost; 700 
For though his haughty heart deny 
A parting meeting to his eye, 
Still fondly strains his anxious ear, 
The accents of her voice to hear, 
And inly did he curse the breeze 705 
That waked to sound the rustling trees. 
But hark! what mingles in the strain? 
It is the harp of Allan-bane, 
That wakes its measure slow and high, 
Attuned to sacred minstrelsy 710 
What melting voice attends the strings? 
*Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings.

Died on the harp the closing hymn—- 740

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
Twice pointed to the sun’s decline. 745 
Then while his plaid he round him cast, 
“It is the last time—'tis the last,” 
He muttered thrice, “the last time e’er 
That angel voice shall Roderick hear!” 
It was a goading thought—his stride 
Hied hastier down the mountain-side; 
Sullen he flung him in the boat, 
And instant ’cross the lake it shot. 
They landed in that silvery bay, 
And eastward held their hasty way, 755 
Till, with the latest beams of light, 
The band arrived on Lanrick height, 
Where mustered in the vale below 
Clan-Alpine’s men in martial show. 750 
XXXII 
A various scene the clansmen made; —_760 
Some sate, some stood, some slowly 
strayed; 
But most with maniles folded round, 
Were couched to rest upon the ground, 
Scarce to be known by curious eye, 
From the deep heather where they lie, 765 
So well was matched the tartan screen 
With heath-bell dark and brackens green, 
Unless where, here and there, a blade 
Or Jance’s point a glimmer made, 769 
Like glowworm twinkling through the 
shade. 
But when, advancing through the gloom, 
They saw the Chieftain’s eagle plume, 
Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide, 
Shook the steep mountain’s steady side. 
Thrice it arose, and lake and fell 715 
Three times returned the martial yell; 
It died upon Bochastle’s plain, ~ 
And Silence claimed her evening reign. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Note the effect of peace and quiet in 
stanza 11 compared with the impatience and 
foreboding of stanza mt. .What words and 
Phrases help especially to produce these con- 
trasting effects? 
% In the description of the priest Brian, 
Scott brings together many a Highland and 
Celtic superstition; what are some of these? 
What well-known Celtic king have you read 
about whose father was unknown, as Brian’s « 
was? Find the lines that tell how it happened 
that Brian came at the particular time he did. 
What was Roderick’s crest? What significance 319 
do you see in the line, stanza vu, “The thunder- 
bolt had split the pine” as you read again the 
first stanza of the Boat Song, Canto Second? 
8. Scott takes his readers out of their 
present-day surroundings back into the time 
and spirit of the story he tells; which stanzas do 
you think help to do this particularly well? 
4, The “sepulchral yew,” the fire, and the 
blood of the Fiery Cross—each symbolizes 
@ particular doom; find the stanza that tells 
the doom symbolized by each. Why was it 
fitting that the vassals, or clansmen, should 
all join in pronouncing the first doom, and the 
women and children join in pronouncing the 
second? You will be interested in noticing 
how many synonyms for “doom” Scott uses 
in these stanzas. 
5. Sketch a simple map on the blackboard 
and trace the route taken by the Fiery Cross. 
Which one, Malise, Angus, or Norman, to 
judge by distances on the map, carried the 
cross farthest? On some maps St. Bride’s 
chapel is located east. of Loch Lubnaig and 
the river Teith; what in stanza xix would 
make this location seem to be correct? On 
the other hand, what reason have you for 
thinking that the entire route was west of Loch 
Lubnaig and that the stream Angus crossed 
probably was a branch of the Teith, called by 
the poet, “‘Teith’s young waters”? Select lines 
that give the reader an idea of the speed of 
Malise, Angus, and Norman. Which stanza 
gives a vivid picture of the response of the 
clansmen? ‘ 
6, Try to tell the action of this Canto in ° 
three sentences, the subject-matter of each 
being, respectively: The Fiery Cross; The 
gathering of the clan; Roderick Dhu. How 
do stanzas xxvi and xxx affect your feeling 
for Roderick Dhu? 
7. What purpose do the songs serve in 
Canto Third? Which of the three do you like 
best to repeat? You will find that Scott ob- 
tained the effect desired in these songs partly 
by the rime-scheme he used; analyze the various 
rime-schemes in the songs and in stanza rx. 
Notice especially the two-syllabled rimes in the 
coronach. -

My sunken pulse, my eyeballs dim, 119 
My soul with harrowing anguish torn—

Where ne’er before such blossom smiled; 
By this soft hand to lead thee far 
From frantic scenes of feud and war.

They bear us soon to Stirling gate.

The wreck my vanity brought on!—

He proffered to attend her side, 
As brother would a sister guide. 
“O little know’st thou Roderick’s heart! 
Safer for both we go apart. 
O haste thee, and from Allan learn 
If thou may’st trust yon wily kern.” 
With hand upon his forehead laid, 
The conflict of his mind to shade, 
A parting step or two he made; 
Then, as some thought had crossed his brain, 
He paused, and turned, and came again. 460 450

“Hear, lady, yet a parting word! 
It chanced in fight that my poor sword 
Preserved the life of Scotland’s lord. 
This ring the grateful Monarch gave, 
And bade, when I had boon to crave, 
To bring it back, and boldly claim 
The recompense that I would name. 
Elien, I am no courtly Jord, 
But one who lives by lance and sword, 
Whose castle is his helm and shield, 
His lordship the embattled field. 
What from a prince can I demand, 
Who neither reck of state nor land? 
Ellen, thy hand—the ring is thine; 
Each guard and usher knows the sign. 
Seek thou the king without delay— 
This signet shall secure thy way— 
And claim thy suit, whate’er it be, 
As ransom of his pledge to me.” 
He placed the golden circlet on, 480 
Paused—kissed her hand—-and then was 
gone. 
The aged Minstrel stood aghast, 
So hastily Fitz-James shot past.

Across the stream they took their way,

All in the Trosach’s glen was still; 
Noontide was sleeping on the hill; 
Sudden his guide whooped loud and high— 
“Murdoch! was that a signal cry?” 491 
He stammered forth—“I shout to’ scare 
Yon raven from his dainty fare.” 
He looked—he knew the raven’s prey, 494

Now wound the path its dizzy ledge 
Around a precipice’s edge, 
When lo! a wasted female form, 
Blighted by wrath of sun and storm, 
In tattered weeds and wild array, 
Stood on a cliff beside the way, 
And glancing round her restless eye, 
Upon the wood, the rock, the sky, 
Seemed naught to mark, yet all to spy. 
Her brow was wreathed with gaudy broom; 
With gesture wild she waved a plume 
Of feathers, which the eagles fling 
To crag and cliff from dusky wing; 
Such spoils her desperate step had sought, 
Where scarce was footing for the goat. 516 
The tartan plaid she first descried, 
And shrieked till all the rocks replied; 
As loud she laughed when near they drew, 
For then the Lowland garb she knew; 520 
And then her hands she wildly wrung, 
And then she wept, and then she sung— 
She sung!—the voice, in better time,

Slight cause will then suffice to guide 80

Yet, ere again ye sought this spot, 
Say, heard ye nought of Lowland war, 
Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?” 
“No, by my word—of bands prepared 90 
To guard King James’s sports I heard; 
Nor doubt J aught, but, when they hear 
This muster of the mountaineer, 
Their pennons will abroad be flung, 94 
Which else in Doune had peaceful hung.” 
“Free be they flung!—for we were loath 
Their silken folds should feast the moth. 
Free be they flung!—as free shall wave

Bewildered in the mountain game, 
Whence the bold boast by which you show

Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu, 
Save as an outlawed, desperate man,

With ruffian dagger stabbed a knight;

What recked the Chieftain if he stood 
On Highland heath, or Holy-Rood? 19 
He rights such wrong where it is given, 
If it were in the court of heaven.” 
“Still was it outrage—yet, ’tis true, 
Not then claimed sovereignty his due; 
While Albany, with feeble hand, 
Held borrowed truncheon of command, 125 
The young King, mewed in Stirling tower, 
Was stranger to respect and power. 
But then, thy Chieftain’s robber life!— 
‘Winning mean prey by causeless strife, 
Wrenching from ruined Lowland swain 130 
His herds and harvest reared in vain— 
Methinks a soul like thine should scorn 
The spoils from such foul foray borne.”

The Gael beheld hinf grim the while, 
And answered with disdainful smile— 135 
“Saxon, from yonder mountain high, 
I marked thee send delighted eye, 
Far to the south and east, where lay, 
Extended in succession gay, 
Deep waving fields and pastures green, 140 
With gentle slopes and groves between; 
These fertile plains, that softened vale, 
Were once the birthrightof the Gael; 
The stranger came with iron hand, 
And from our fathers reft the land. 145 
Where dwell we now? See, rudely swell 
Crag over crag, and fell o’er fell. 
Ask we this savage hill we tread 
For fattened steer or household bread: 
Ask we for flocks these shingles dry, 130

‘To you, as to your sites of yore, 
Belong the target and claymore! 
I give you shelter in my breast, 14 
Your own good blades must win the rest.’

“Have, then, thy. wish!” He whistled shrill 
And he was answered from the hill; 
Wild as the scream of the curlew, 
From crag to crag the signal flew. 
Instant, through copse and heath, arose ° 
Bonnets and spears and bended bows; 201 
On right, on left, above, below, 
Sprung up at once the lurking foe; 
From shingles gray their lances start, 
The bracken bush sends forth the dart, 205 
The rushes and the willow-wand 
Are bristling into ax and brand, 
And every tuft of broom gives life 
To plaided warrior armed for strife. 
That whistle garrisoned the glen 
At once with full five hundred men, 
As if the yawning hill to heaven 210 
186. promise, Canto Fourth, stanza xxvii, 331 
A subterranean host had given. 
Watching their leader’s beck and will, 
All silent there they stood, and still. 215 
Like the loose crags whose threatening mass 
Lay tottering o’er the hollow pass, 
As if an infant’s touch could urge 
Their headlong passage down the verge, 
With step and weapon forward flung, 220 
Upon the mountain-side they hung. 
The Mountaineer cast glance of pride 
Along Benledi’s living side, 
Then fixed his eye and sable brow 224 
Full on ‘Fitz-James—“How say’st thou 
now? 
These are Clan-Alpine’s warriors true; 
And, Saxon—I am Roderick Dhu!” 
x 
Fitz-James was brave. Though to his heart 
The life-blood thrilled with sudden start, 
He manned himself with dauntless air, 230 
Returned the Chief his haughty stare, 
His back against a rock he bore, 
And firmly placed his foot before: 
“Come one, come all! this rock shall fly 
From its firm base as soon as I.” 235 
Sir Roderick marked—and in his eyes 
. Respect was mingled with surprise, 
And the stern joy which warriors feel 
In foemen worthy of their steel. 
Short space he stood, then waved his hand; 
Down sunk the disappearing band; 241 
Each warrior vanished where he stood, 
In broom or bracken, heath or wood; 
Sunk brand and spear and bended bow 
In osiers pale and copses low; 
It seemed as if their mother Earth 
Had swallowed up her warlike birth. 
The wind’s last breath had tossed in air 
Pennon, and plaid, and plumage fair; 
The next but swept a lone hillside, 250 
Where heath and fern were waving wide. 
The sun’s last glance was glinted back 
From spear and glaive, from targeand jack, 
The next, all unreflected, shone . 
On bracken green, and cold gray stone. 255 245

Delusion of a dreadful dream. 
Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed, 260 
And to his look the Chief replied: 
“Fear naught—nay, that I need not say— 
But—doubt not aught from mine array. 
Thou art my guest—I pledged my word 
As far as Coilantogle ford; 265 
Nor would I call a clansman’s brand 
For aid against one valiant hand, - 
Though on our strife lay every vale 
Rent by the Saxon from the Gael. 
So move we on—I only meant 
To show the reed on which you leant, 
Deeming this path you might pursue 
Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.” 
They moved—I said Fitz-James was brave, 
As ever knight that belted glaive; 275 
~ Yet dare not say that now his blood 
Kept on its wont and tempered flood, 
As, following Roderick’s stride, he drew 
That seeming lonesome pathway through, 
Which yet, by fearful proof, was rife 280 
With lances, that, to take his life, 
Waited but signal from a guide, 
So late dishonored and defied. 
Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round 
The vanished guardians of the ground, 285 
And still, from copse and heather deep, 
Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep, 
And in the plover’s shrilly strain 
The signal whistle heard again. 
Nor breathed he free till far behind 
The pass was left; for then they wind 
Along a wide and level green, 
Where neither tree nor tuft was seen, 
Nor rush nor bush of broom was near, 
To hide a bonnet or a spear. 270

“Bold Saxon! to his promise just,

ward, 
Far past Clan-Alpine’s outmost guard. 
Now, man to man, and steel to steel,

The Saxon paused: “I ne’er delayed,

Nay imore, brave Chief, I vowed thy death; 
Yet sure thy fair and generous faith, 
And my deep debt for life preserved, 
A better meed have well deserved; 
Can naught but blood our feud atone? 325 
Are there no means?” “No, Stranger, none! 
And hear—to fire thy flagging zeal— 
The Saxon cause rests on thy steel; 
For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred 
Between the living and the dead; 330 
‘Who spills the foremost foeman’s life, 
His party conquers in the strife.’ ” 
“Then, by my word,” the Saxon said, 
“The riddle is already read. 
Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff— 335 
There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff 
Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy, 
Then yield to Fate, and not to me,

Dark lightning flashed from Roderick’s 
eye— 
“Soars thy presumption, then, so high,

Who ill deserved my courteous care, 
And whose best boast is but to wear 
A braid of his fair lady’s hair.” 
“T thank thee, Roderick, for the word! 360 
It nerves my heart, it steels my sword; 
For I have sworn this braid to stain 
In the best blood that warms thy vein. 
Now, truce, farewell! and, ruth, begone!— 
Yet think not that by thee alone, 
Proud Chief! can courtesy be shown; 
Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn, 
Start at my whistle clansmen stern, 
Of thi3 small horn one feeble blast 
Would fearful odds against thee cast. 370 
But fearnot—doubt not—which thou wilt—

Each on the ground his scabbard threw,

That on the field his targe he threw, 380 
Whose brazen studs and tough bull-hide 
Had death so often dashed aside; 
For, trained abroad his arms to wield, 
Fitz-James’s blade was sword: and shield. 
He practiced every pass and ward, 3865 
To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard; 
While less expert, though stronger far, 
The Gael maintained unequal war. 
Three times in closing strife they stood, 
And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood; 
No stinted- draught, no scanty tide, 391 
The gushing flood the tartans dyed. 
Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain, 
And showered his blows like wintry rain; 
And, as firm rock, or castle-roof, 395 
Against the winter shower is proof, 
The foe, invulnerable still, 
Foiled his wild rage by steady skill;

But hate and fury ill supplied 
The stream of life’s exhausted tide,

As if he loved his lord to hear. 
No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed, 
No grasp upon the saddle laid, 475 
But wreathed his left hand in the mane, 
And lightly bounded from the plain, 
Turned on the horse his arméd heel, 
And stirred his courage with the steel. 
Bounded the fiery steed in air; 480 
The rider sat erect and fair; 
Then like a bolt from steel crossbow 
Forth launched, along the plain they go. 
They dashed that rapid torrent through, 
And up Carhonie’s hill they flew; 485

His merrymen followed as they might.

And in the race they mock thy tide;

As up the flinty path they strained, 
Sudden his steed the leader reined; 
A signal to his squire he flung, 
Who instant to his stirrup sprung: 
“Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray, 
Who townward holds the rocky way, 511 
Of stature tall and poor array? 
Mark’st thou the firm, yet active stride, 
With which he scales the mountain-side? 
Know’st thou from whence he comes, or 
whom?” 
“No, by my word—a burly groom 516 
He seems, who in the field or chase 
A baron’s train would nobly grace.” 
“Out, out, De Vaux! can fear supply, 
And jealousy, no sharper eye? 520 
Afar, ere to the hill he drew, 
That stately form and step I xnew; 
Like form in Scotland is not seen, 
Treads not such step on Scottish green.

Away, away, to court, to show 
The near approach of dreaded foe;

They won the castle’s postern gate.

From Cambus-Kenneth’s abbey gray,

Was exiled from his native land. 675

Though wrecked by many a winter’s storm;

The youth with awe and wonder saw © 
His strength surpassing Nature’s law. 
Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd, 
Till murmur rose to clamors loud. 681 
But not a glance from that proud ring 
Of peers who circled round the King 
With Douglas held communion kind, 
Or called the banished man to mind; 685 
No, not from those who, at the chase, 
Once held his side the honored place, 
Begirt his board, and, in the field, 
Found safety underneath his shield; 
For he, whom royal eyes disown, 690 
When was his form to courtiers: known!

The Monarch saw the gambols flag, 
And bade let loose a gallant stag, 
Whose pride, the holiday to crown, 
Two favorite greyhounds should pull down, 
That venison free, and Bordeaux wine, 696 
Might serve the archery to dine. 
But Lufra—whom from Douglas’ side 
Nor bribe nor threat could e’er divide, 
The fleetest hound in all the North— 
Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth. 701 
She left the royal hounds midway, 
And dashing on the antlered prey, 
Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank, 
And deep the flowing lifeblood drank.. 705 
The King’s stout huntsman saw the sport 
By strange intruder broken short,” 
Came up, and with his leash unbound, 
In anger struck the noble hound. 
The Douglas had endured, that morn, 710 
The King’s cold look, the nobles’ scorn, 
And last, and worst to spirit proud, 
Had borne the pity of the crowd; 
But Lufra bad been fondly bred, 
To share his board, to watch his bed, 715 
And oft would Ellen Lufra’s neck 
In maiden glee with garlands deck; 
They were such playmates that with name 
Of Lufra, Ellen’s image came. 
His stifled wrath is brimming high, 720 
In darkened brow and flashing eye; 
As waves before the bark divide, 
The crowd gave way before his stride; 
Needs but a buffet and no more, 
The groom lies senseless in his gore. 725 
Such blow no other hand could deal, 
Though gauntleted in glove of steel.

Then clamored loud the royal train, 
And brandished swords and staves amain. 
But stern the Baron’s warning—“Back! 
Back, on your lives, ye menial pack! — 731 
Beware The Douglas.—Yes! behold, 
King James! The Douglas, doomed of old, 
And vainly sought for near and far, 
A victim to atone the war, 735 
A willing victim, now attends, 
Nor craves thy grace but for his friends.” 
“Thus is my clemency repaid? 
Presumptuous lord!” the monarch said; 
“Of thy misproud ambitious clan, 740 
Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man, 
The only man, in whom a foe 
My woman-mercy would not know; 
But shall a Monarch’s preserice brook 
Injurious blow and haughty look? 745 
What ho! the Captain of our Guard! 
Give the offender fitting ward.

And yeomen ’gan to bend their bows— 
“Break off the sports!’ he said, and 
frowned, 750 
“And bid our horsemen clear the ground.”

Then uproar wild and misarray 
Marred the fair form of festal day. 
The horsemen pricked among the crowd, 
Repelled by threats and insult loud; — 755

The timorous fly, the women shriek; 
With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar, 
The hardier urge tumultuous war. 
At once round Douglas darkly sweep 760 
The royal spears in circle deep, 
And slowly scale the pathway steep; 
While on the rear in thunder pour 
The rabble with disordered roar. 
With grief the noble Douglas saw 765 
The Commons rise against the law, 
And to the leading soldier said, 
“Sir John of Hyndford! "Twas my blade 
That knighthood on thy shoulder laid; 
For that good deed, permit me then 770

Are these so weak as must require 
The aid of your misguided ire? 
Or, if I suffer causeless wrong, 
Is then my selfish rage so strong, 
My sense of public weal so low, 7380 
That, for mean vengeance on a foe, 
Those cords of love I should unbind 
Which knit my country and my kind? 
O no! Believe, in yonder tower 
It will not soothe my captive hour 735 
To know those spears our foes should dread 
For me in kindred gore are red; 
To know, in fruitless brawl begun. 
For me, that mother wails her son; 
For me, that widow’s mate expires; 790 
For me, that orphans weep their sires; 
That patriots mourn insulted laws, 
And curse The Douglas for the cause. 
O let your patience ward such ill, ‘794 
And keep your right to love me still!”

The crowd’s wild fury sunk again 
In tears, as tempests melt in rain. 
With lifted hands and eyes, they prayed 
For blessings on his generous head,

They mourned him pent within the hold, 
“Where stout Earl William was of old.” 
And there his word the speaker stayed, 
And finger on his lip he laid, 
Or pointed to his dagger blade.

At evening to the Castle pressed; 
And busy talkers said they bore 
Tidings of fight on Katrine’s shore;

And lasted till the set of sun. 
Thus giddy rumor shook the town, 
Till closed the Night her pennons brown.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Find stanzas that relate incidents illus- 
trating the statement in stanza 1: 
“Fair as that beam . . . 
Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy’s bright 
star . 
Through all the wreckful storms that cloud 
the brow of war.” , 
2. What other names besides “Gael” and 
“chieftain” does the poet apply to Roderick 
Dhu? By what other names besides “Saxon” 
and “knight” is Fitz James called? 
3. Describe the picture that the reader 
gets from stanza m. As you read the vivid 
description of the mountain in stanza mm, does 
it seem to you that Scott describes this Scottish 
scenery for the sheer love of the locality or 
does it serve a special purpose in the story? 
4, What three accusations does Fitz~James| 
bring against Clan Alpine’s chief? How is each
-P-A-G-E-348
THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
one answered? Which is the most dramatic 
moment of the poem? What quality in Fitz- 
James did Roderick Dhu recognize when he 
said, “Fear naught—nay, that I need not 
say—~’? Why is the pathway called “seeming 
lonesome”? Does the prophecy in Canto 
Fourth, stanza vi, heighten the dramatic effect 
of the scene in stanza xu1? What do you 
think of Fitz-James’s terms? What quality in 
Roderick Dhu does his answer to Fitz-James - 
show? What effect did the mention of the 
“braid of his fair lady’s hair” have upon Fitz- 
James? Describe the combat. Which one, 
Roderick Dhu or Fitz-James, do you think 
excels in generosity and in courage? 
5. What hint of other plans is there in the 
phrase “fairer freight,” line 462? What do the 
proper names in stanzas xvi and xvi add to 
the description? What mention of names in 
the games serves the same purpose? 
6. What new facts about The Douglas 
have you learned from this Canto? Why did 
he come to Stirling? What reason did Ellen 
give in Canto Fourth, stanza x? Discuss 
stanza XIX as an artistic preparation for the 
following scene. Read aloud stanza xx to 
bring out the strong contrast between The 
Douglas’s thoughts and the burgher’s sports. 
Notice how the King’s greeting is modified to 
suit the station of the various persons. What 
lines show that all are not friendly and loyal 
subjects at heart? 
7. Discuss the success of Douglas at the 
games—in archery, in wrestling, and in hurling; 
what was the prize in each case and how was 
it bestowed? Compare the attitude of the 
crowd with that of the peers toward Douglas’s 
success. Relate the incident of the dog Lufra. 
What quality does The Douglas show as he 
reveals himself to the King? What do you ad- 
mire particularly about The Douglas in his 
“word with these misguided men”? Do you 
think King James’s judgment of the “changeling 
crowd” is too severe? What is the situation as 
revealed in stanzas XXXI to xxxItI?

The sun, awakening, through the smoky air 
Of the dark city casts a sullen glance, 
Rousing each caitiff to his task of care, 
Of sinful man the sad inheritance; 
Summoning revelers from the lagging 
dance, 5 339 
Scaring the prowling robber to his den; 
‘Gilding on battled tower the warder’s

And warning student pale to leave his

And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind

What various scenes, and, Oh! what seenes

Through crowded hospital beholds its

With soldier-step and weapon-clang, 20 
While drums, with rolling note, foretell

Through narrow loop and casement barred, 
The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard, 
And, struggling with the smoky air, 25 
Deadened the torches’ yellow glare. 
In comfortless alliance shone 
The lights through arch of blackened stone, 
And showed wild shapes in garb of war, 
Faces deformed with beard and scar, 30 
All haggard from the midnight watch, 
And fevered with the stern debauch; 
For the oak table’s massive board, 33 
Flooded with wine, with fragments stored, 
And beakers drained, and cups o’erthrown, 
Showed in what sport the night had flown. 
Some, weary, snored on floor and bench; 
Some labored still their thirst to quench; ' 
Some chilled with watching, spread their

  THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
A maid and minstrel with him come.” 
Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarred, 
Was entering now the Court of Guard, 115 
A harper with him, and in plaid 
All muffled close, a mountain maid, 
Who backward shrunk, to ’scape the view 
Of the loose scene and boisterous crew. 
“What news?” they roared. “I only know, 
From noon till eve we fought with foe, 121 
As wild and as untamable 
As the rude mountains where they dwell; 
On both sides store of blood is lost, 
Nor much success can either boast.” 125 
“But whence thy captives, friend? Such 
spoil As theirs must needs reward thy toil. 
Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp; 
Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp! 
Get thee an ape, and trudge the land, 130 
The leader of a‘juggler band.”

“No, comrade; no such fortune mine. 
After the fight these sought our line, 
That aged harper and the girl, 
And, having audience of the Earl, 135 
Mar bade I should purvey them steed, 
And bring them hitherward with speed. 
Forbear your mirth and rude alarm, 
For none shall do them shame or harm.” 
“Hear ye his boast?” cried John of Brent, 
Ever to strife and jangling bent; 141 
“Shall he strike doe beside our lodge, 
And yet the jealous niggard grudge 
To pay the forester his fee? 
Tl have my share, howe’er it be, 145 
Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee.” 
Bertram his forward step withstood; 
And, burning in his vengeful mood, 
Old Allan, though unfit for strife, 
Laid hand upon his dagger-knife; 150 
But Ellen boldly, stepped between, 
And dropped at once the tartan screen— 
So, from his morning cloud, appears 
The sun of May, through summer tears.

And with him in the battle bled. 
Not from the valiant or the strong 
‘Should exile’s daughter suffer wrong.” 
Answered de Brent, most forward still 165 
In every feat or good or ill, 
“I shame me of the part I played; 
And thou an outlaw’s child, poor maid! 
An outlaw I by forest laws, 
And merry Needwoodknowsthe cause. 170

He wiped his iron eye and brow—

Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James.” 
x 
The signet-ring young Lewis took, 210 
With deep respect and altered look; 
And said, “This ring our duties own; 
And pardon, if to worth unknown, 
In semblance mean obscurely, veiled,

Permit I marshal you the way.” 
But, ere she followed, with the grace 
And open bounty of her race, 
She bade her slender purse be shared 225 
Among the soldiers of the guard. 
The rest with thanks their guerdon took; 
But Brent, with shy and awkward look, 
On the reluctant maiden’s hold 
Forced bluntly back the proffered gold— 
“Forgive a haughty English heart, 231 
And O forget its ruder part! 
The vacant purse shall be my share, 
Which in my barret-cap I'll bear, 
Perchance, in jeopardy of war, 235 
Where gayer crests may keep afar.” 
With thanks—’twas all shecould—the maid 
His rugged courtesy repaid. 
KI 
When Ellen forth with Lewis went, 
Allan made suit to John of Brent: 240 
“My lady safe, O let your grace 
Give me to see my master’s face! 
His minstrel I—to share his doom 
Bound from the cradle to the tomb. 
Tenth in descent, since first my sires 248 
Waked for his noble house their lyres, 
Nor one of all the race was known 
But prized its weal above their own.

Nor leave him till we pour our verse— 
A doleful tribute!—o’er his hearse. 256 
Then let me share his captive lot; 
It is my right—deny it not!” 
“Little we reck,” said John of Brent, 
“We Southern men, of long descent; —_260 
Nor wot we how a name—a word— 
Makes clansmen vassals to a lord; 
Yet kind my noble Jandlord’s part~ 
God bless the house of Beaudesert! 
And, but I loved to drive the deer, 265 
More than to guide the laboring steer, 
Thad not dwelt an outcast here. 
Come, good old Minstrel, follow me; 
Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see.” 
xa 
Then, from a rusted iron hook, 270 
A bunch of ponderous keys he took, 
Lighted a torch, and Allan led 
Through grated arch and passage dread. 
Portals they passed, where, deep within, 
Spoke prisoner’s moan and fetters’ din; 275 
Through rugged vaults, where, loosely 
stored, 
Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman’s sword, 
And many an hideous engine grim, __ 
For wrenching joint, and crushing limb, 
By artist formed who deemed it shame 280 
And sin to give their work a name. 
They halted at a low-browed porch, 
And Brent to Allan gave the torch, 
While bolt and chain he backward rolled, 
And made the bar unhasp its hold. 235 
They entered—’twas a prison-room 
Of stern security and gloom, 
Yet not a dungeon; for the day 
Through lofty gratings found its way, 
And rude and antique garniture 290 
Decked the sad walls and oaken floor, 
Such as the rugged days of old 
Deemed fit for captive noble’s hold. 
“Here,” said de Brent, “thou mayst remain 
Till the leech visit him again. 295 
Strict is his charge, the warders tell, 
To tend the noble prisoner well.” 
Retiring then the bolt he drew, 
And the lock’s murmurs growled anew

Shall never stem the billows more, ° 
Deserted by her gallant band, 
Amid the breakers lies astrand, 
So, on his couch, Jay Roderick Dhu! 310 
And oft his fevered limbs he threw 
In toss abrupt, as when her sides 
Lie rocking in the advancing tides, 
That shake her frame with ceaseless beat, 
Yet cannot heave her from her seat— 315- 
Oh! how unlike her course at sea! 
Or his free step on hill and lea! 
Soon as the Minstrel he could scan, 
“What of thy lady?—of my clan?-— 
My mother?—-Douglas?—tell me all! 320 
Have they been ruined in my fall? 
Ah, yes! or wherefore art thou here! 
Yet speak—speak boldly—do not fear.” 
For Allan, who his mood well knew, 
Was choked with grief and terror too. 325 
“Who fought—who fled?—Old man, be 
brief— 
Some might—for they had lost their Chief. 
Who basely live?—who bravely died?” 
“O calm thee, Chief!’ the Minstrel cried, 
“Ellen is safe” ;—“‘For that thank Heaven!” 
“And hopes arefor The Douglas given; 331 
The Lady Margaret, too, is well; 
And, for thy clan—on field or fell, 
Has never harp of minstrel told, 
Of combat fought so true and bold. 335 
Thy stately Pine is yet unbent, 
Though many a goodly bough is rent.”

The Chieftain reared his form on high, 
And fever’s fire was in his eye; 
But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks 340 
Checkered his swarthy brow and cheeks. 
“Hark, Minstrel! I have heard thee play, 
With measure bold, on festal day, 
In yon lone isle, ... . again where ne’er "sas 
Shall harper play, or warrior hear! . . . 
That stirring air that peals on high, 346 
O’er Dermid’s race our victory. 
Strike it!—and then—for well thou canst— 
Free from thy minstrel spirit glanced, 
Fling me the picture of the fight, 350 
When met my clan the Saxon might. 
Tl listen, till my fancy hears . 
The clang of swords, the crash of spears! 
These grates, these walls, shall vanish then, 
For the fair field of fighting men, . 355 
And my free spirit burst away, 
As if it soared from battle fray.” 
The trembling Bard with awe obeyed— 
Slow on the harp his hand he laid; 
But soon remembrance of the sight 360 
He witnessed from the mountain’s height, 
With what old Bertram told at night, 
Awakened the full power of song, 
And bore him in career along; 
As shallop launched on river’s tide, 365 
That slow and fearful leaves the side, 
But, when it feels the middle stream, 
Drives downward swift as lightning’s beam.

“Their light-armed archers far and near 
Surveyed the tangled ground, 401 
Their center ranks, with pike and spear, 
A twilight forest frowned, 
Their barded horsemen, in the rear, 
The stern battalia crowned. 405 
No cymbal clashed, no clarion rang, 
Still were the pipe and drum; 
Save heavy tread, and armor’s clang, 
The sullen march was dumb. 
There breathed no wind their crests to 
shake, 410 
Or wave their flags abroad; 
Scarce the frail aspen seemed to quake, 
That shadowed o’er their road. 
Their vaward scouts no tidings bring, 
Can rouse no lurking foe, 415 
Nor spy a trace of living thing, 
Save when they stirred the roe; 
The host moves, like a deep-sea wave, 
Where rise no rocks its pride to brave, 
High-swelling, dark, and slow. 420 
The lake is passed, and now they gain 
A narrow and a broken plain,’ 
Before the Trosachs’ rugged jaws; 
And here the horse and spearmen pause, 
While, to explore the dangerous glen, 425 
Dive through the pass the archer-men.

“At once there rose so wild a yell 
Within that dark and narrow dell, 
As all the fiends, from heaven that fell, 
Had pealed the banner-cry of hell! 430 
Forth from the pass in tumuit driven, 
Like chaff before the wind of heaven,

And plaids and bonnets waving high, 
And broadswords flashing to the sky,

Onward they drive, in dreadful race, 
Pursuers and pursued; 440 
Before that tide of flight and chase, 
How shall it keep its rooted place, 
The spearmen’ s twilight wood? 
‘Down, down,’ cried Mar, ‘your lances 
down! 
Bear back both friend and foe? 445

That serried grove of lances brown.

“Bearing before them, in their course, 455

And with the ocean’s mighty swing, 
‘When heaving to the tempest’s wing, 
They hurled them on the foe. 
T heard the lance’s shivering crash, 465 
As when the whirlwind rends the ash; 
I heard the broadsword’s deadly clang, 
As if an hundred anvils rang! 
But Moray wheeled his rearward rank 
Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine’s flank, 470 
“My banner-man, advance! 
I see,’ he cried, ‘their column shake. 
Now gallanis! for your ladies’ sake, 
Upon them with the lance!’

THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
And refluent through the pass of fear 
The battle’s tide was poured; 484 
Vanished the Saxon’s struggling spear, 
Vanished the mountain-sword. 
As Bracklinn’s chasm, so black and steep, 
Receives her roaring linn, 
As the dark caverns of the deep 
Suck the wild whirlpool in, 
So did the deep and darksome pass 
Devour the battle’s mingled mass; 
None linger now upon the plain, 
Save those who ne’er shall fight again. 490

“Now westward.-rolls the battle’s din, 495 
That deep and doubling pass within.— 
Minstrel, away! the work of fate 
Is bearing on; its issue wait, 
Where the rude Trosachs’ dread defile 
Opens on Katrine’s lake and isle. 
Gray Benvenue I soon repassed, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.

T heeded not the eddying surge, 
Mine eye but saw the Trosachs’ gorge, 
Mine ear but heard that sullen sound 
Which like an earthquake shook the 
ground, 
And spoke the stern and desperate strife 
That parts not but with parting life, 
Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll 
The dirge of many a passing soul. 
Nearer it comes—the dim wood glen 
The martial flood disgorged again, 
But not in mingled tide; 
The plaided warriors of the North 
High on the mountain thunder forth 
And overhang its side; 
While by the lake below appears 
The dark’ning cloud of Saxon spears. 
At weary bay each shattered band, 
Eyeing their foemen, sternly stand; 
Their banners stream like tattered sail, 
That flings its fragments to the gale, 
broken arms and disarray 
Marked the fell havoc of the day. 510

“Viewing the mountain’s ridge askance; 
The Saxon stood in sullen trance, 
Till Moray pointed with his lance, 
And cried—Behold yon isle! 
See! none are left to guard its strand, 
But women weak, that wring the hand; 
Tis there of yore the robber band 
Their booty wont to pile. 
My purse, with bonnet-pieces store, 
To him will-swim a bow-shot o’er, 
And loose a shallop from the shore. 
Lightly we'll tame the war-wolf then, 
Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.’ 
Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung, 
On earth his casque and corselet rung, 
He plunged him in the wave; 
All saw the deed—the purpose knew, 
And to their clamors Benvenue 
A mingled echo gave; 
The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer, 
The helpless females scream for fear, 
And yells fér rage the mountaineer. 
*Twas then, as by the outcry riven, 
Poured down at once the lowering heaven; 
A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine’s breast, 
Her billows reared their snowy crest. 556 
Well for the swimmer swelled they high, 
To mar the Highland marksman’s eye; 
For round him showered, mid rain and hail, 
The vengeful arrows of the Gael. 560 
In vain—he nears the isle—and lo! 
His hand is on a shallop’s bow. 
Just then a flash of lightning came, 
It tinged the waves and strand with flame; 
I marked Duncraggan’s widowed dame, 534 
546 
551 
Behind an oak I saw her stand, 566 
A naked dirk gleamed in her hand; 
It darkened—but, amid the moan 
Of waves, I heard a dying groan; 
Another flash!—the spearman floats 570 
A weltering corse beside the boats, 
And the stern matron o’er him stood, 
Her hand and dagger streaming blood.

Again they hurried to engage; 
But, ere they closed in desperate fight, 
Bloody with spurring came a knight, 579 
Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag, 
Waved ’twixt the hosts a milk-white flug. 
Clarion and trumpet by his side 
Rung forth a truce-note high and wide, 
While, in the Monarch’s name, afar 
An herald’s voice forbade the war, 585 
_ For Bothwell’s lord, and Roderick bold, 
Were both, he said, in captive hold.” 
—But here the lay made sudden stand, 
The harp escaped the Minstrel’s hand!— 
Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy 590 
How Roderick brooked his minstrelsy. 
At first, the Chieftain, to the chime, 
With lifted hand, kept feeble time; 
That motion ceased—yet feeling strong 
Varied his look as changed the song; 595 
At length, no more his deafened ear 
The minstrel melody can hear; 
His face grows sharp—his hands are 
clenched, 
As if some pang his heart-strings wrenched; 
Set are his teeth, his fading eye 600 
Is sternly fixed on vacancy; 
Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew 
His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu! 
Old Allan-bane looked on aghast, 604 
While grim and still his spirit passed; 
But when he saw that life was fled, 
He poured his wailing o’er the dead.

Ellen, the while, with bursting heart, 
Remained in lordly bower- apart, 636 
Where played, with many colored gleams, 
Through storied pane the rising beams. 
In vain on gilded roof they fall, 
And lightened up a tapestried wall, 640 
And for her use a menial train 
A rich collation spread in vain. 
The banquet proud, the chamber gay, 
Scarce drew one curious glance astray; 
Or if she looked, ’twas but to say, - 645 
With better omen dawned the day 
In that lone isle, where waved on high 
The dun-deer’s hide for canopy; 
Where oft her noble father shared 
The simple meal her care prepared, 650 
While Lufra, crouching by her side, 
Her station claimed with jealous pride, 
And Douglas, bent on woodland game, 
Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Greeme,

And I am sick of captive thrall. 
I wish I were as I have been, 
Hunting the hart in forest green, 670 
With bended bow and bloodhound free, 
For that’s the life is meet for me. 
“T hate to learn the ebb of time, 
From yon dull steeple’s drowsy chime, 
Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl, 
Inch after inch, along the wall. 
The lark was wont my matins ring, 
The sable rook my vespers sing; 
These towers, although a king’s they be, 
Have not a hall of joy for me. 680 675 
“No more at dawning mom I rise, 
And sun myself in Ellen’s eyes, 
Drive the fleet deer the forest through, 
And homeward wend with evening dew; 
A blithesome welcome blithely meet, 685 
And lay my trophies at her feet, 
While fled the eve on wing of glee— 
That life is lost to love and me!”

The heartsick lay was hardly said, 
The list’ner had not turned her head, 
It trickled still, the starting tear, 
When light a footstep struck her ear, 
And Snowdoun’s graceful knight was 
near. 
She turned the hastier, lest again 
The prisoner should renew his strain. 695 
“O welcome, brave Fitz-James!”’ she said; 
“How may an almost orphan maid 
Pay the deep debt”—“O say not so! 
To me no gratitude you owe. 
Not mine, alas! the boon to give, 
And bid thy noble father live; 
I can but be thy guide, sweet maid, 
With Scotland’s King thy suit to aid. 
No tyrant he, though ire and pride 
May lay his better mood aside. 705 
Come, Ellen, come! ’tis more than time, 
He holds his court at morning prime.” 
With beating heart, and bosom wrung, 
As to a brother’s arm she clung. 
Gently he dried the falling tear, 710 
And gently whispered hope and cheer; 
Her faltering steps, half led, half stayed, 
Through gallery fair, and high arcade, 
Till, at his touch, its wings of pride 690

As wreath of snow, on mountain-breast, 
Slides from the rock that gave it rest, 
Poor Ellen glided from her stay, 
And at the Monarch’s feet she lay; 
No word her choking voice commands— 745 
She showed the ring—sheclasped her hands. 
Oh! not a moment could he brook, 747 
The generous Prince, that suppliant look! 
Gently he raised her—and, the while, 
Checked with a glance the circle’s smile; 
Graceful, but grave, her brow he kissed, 
And bade her terrors be dismissed: 752 
“Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James 
The fealty of Stotland claims. 
To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring; 755 
He will redeem his signet-ring. 
Ask naught for Douglas; yester even 
His Prince and he have much forgiven. 
Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue,

Then forth the noble Douglas sprung, 
And on his neck his daughter hung. 
The Monarch drank, that happy hour, 775

Then, in a tone apart and low— 
“Ah, little traitress! none must know

The condition of the English nation 
was at this time sufficiently miserable. 
King Richard was absent, a prisoner, 
and in the power of the perfidious and 
cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very 
place of his captivity was uncertain, 
and his fate but very imperfectly 
known to the generality of his sub- 
jects, who were, in the meantime, a 
prey to every species of subaltern 
oppression. 
Prince John, in league with Philip 
of France, Cceur-de-Lion’s mortal 
enemy, was using every species of in- 
fluence with the Duke of Austria to 
prolong the captivity of his brother 
Richard, to whom he stood indebted 
for so many favors. In the meantime 
he was strengthening his own faction 
in the kingdom, of which he proposed 
to dispute succession, in case of the 
3, King Richard, Richard I (reigned 1189-1199.) King’s death, with the legitimate heir, 
Arthur, Duke of Brittany, son of 
Geoffrey Plantagenet, the eldez brother 
of John. This usurpation, it is well 
known, he afterwards effected. His 
own character being light, profligate, 
and perfidious, John easily attached 
to his person and faction not only all 
who had reason to dread the resent- x 
ment of Richard for criminal pro- 
ceedings during his absence, but also 
the numerous class of “‘lawless reso- 
lutes” whom the crusades had turned 
back on their country, accomplished 
in the vices of the East, impoverished 
in substance, and hardened in char- 
acter, and who placed their hopes of 
harvest in civil commotion. 
To these causes of public distress # 
and apprehension must be added the 
multitude of outlaws who, driven to 
despair by the oppression of the feudal 
nobility and the severe exercise of the 
forest laws, banded together in large 
gangs, and, keeping possession of the 
forests and the wastes, set at defiance 
the justice and magistracy of the 
country. The nobles themselves, each 
fortified within his own castle, and 
playing the petty sovereign over his 
own dominions, were the leaders of 
bands scarce less lawless and oppres- 
sive than those of the avowed depreda- 
tors. To maintain these retainers, and 
to support the extravagance and mag- 
nificence which their pride induced 
them to affect, the nobility borrowed 
sums of money from the Jews at the 
most usurious interest, which gnawed 
into their estates like consuming 
cankers, scarce to be cured unless 
when circumstances gave them an

opportunity of getting free by exer- 
cising upon their creditors some act 
of unprincipled violence. 
Under the various burdens imposed 
by this unhappy state of affairs, the 
people of England suffered deeply for 
the present, and had yet more dread- 
ful cause to fear for the future. To 
augment their misery, a contagious dis- 
10 order of a dangerous nature spread 
through the land; and, rendered more 
virulent by the uncleanness, the in- 
different food, and the wretched lodg- 
ing of the lower classes, swept off 
many, whose fate the survivors were 
tempted to envy, as exempting them 
from the evils which were to come. 
Yet, amid these accumulated dis- 
tresses, the poor as well as the rich, 
, 2 the vulgar as well as the noble, in the 
event of a tournament, which was the 
grand spectacle of that age, felt as 
much interested as the half-starved 
citizen of Madrid, who has not a real 
left to buy provisions for his family, 
feels in the issue of a bull-feast. 
| Neither duty nor infirmity could keep 
youth or age from such exhibitions. 
The passage of arms, as it was called, 
30 which was to take place at Ashby, in 
the county of Leicester, as champions 
of the first renown were to take the 
field in the presence of Prince John 
himself, who was expected to grace 
the lists, had attracted universal 
attention, and an immense confluence 
of persons of all ranks hastened upon 
the appointed morning to the place of 
combat. 
40 The scene was singularly. romantic. 
On the verge of a wood, which ap- 
proached to within a mile of the town 
of Ashby, was an extensive meadow 
of the finest and most beautiful green 
turf, surrounded on one side by the 
forest, and fringed on the other by 
straggling oak trees, some of which 
wh feats a » Spanish coin, at normal exchange worth had grown to an immense size. The 
ground, as if fashioned on purpose for 
the martial display which was in- 
tended, sloped gradually down on all 
sides to a level bottom, which was 
inclosed for the lists with strong pali-" 
sades, forming a space of a quarter of 
a mile in length, and about half as 
broad. The form of the inclosure was 
an oblong square, save that the corners 
were considerably rounded off, in 
order to afford more convenience for 
the spectators. The openings for the 
entry of the combatants were at the 
northern and southern extremities of 
the lists, accessible by strong wooden 
gates, each wide enough to admit two 
horsemen riding abreast. At each of 
these portals were stationed two 
heralds, attended by six trumpets, as 
many pursuivants, and a strong body 
of men-at-arms, for maintaining order, 
and ascertaining the quality of the 
knights who proposed to engage in this 
martial game. 
On a platform beyond the southern 
entrance, formed by a natural eleva- 
tion of the ground, were pitched five 
magnificent pavilions, adorned with 
pennons of russet and black, the 
chosen colors of the five knights chal- 
lengers. The cords of the tents were 
of the same color. 
vilion was suspended the shield of the 
knight by whom it was occupied, and 
beside it stood his squire, quaintly 
disguised as a salvage or silvan man, 
or in some other fantastic dress, ac- 
cording to the taste of his master and 
the character he was pleased to assume 
during the game 
vilion, as the place of honor, had been 
assigned to Brian de Bois-Guilbert,

to be eagerly received into the com- 
pany of the challengers, and even 
adopted as their chief and leader, 
though he had so recently joined them. 
On one side of his tent were pitched 
“those of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and 
Richard [Philip] de Malvoisin, and on 
the other was the pavilion of Hugh 
de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the 
vicinity, whose ancestor had been 
Lord High Steward of England in the 
time of the Conqueror and his son 
William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a 
knight of St. John of Jerusalem, who 
had some atcient possessions at a 
place called Heather, near Ashby-de- 
la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. 
From the entrance into the lists a 
gently sloping passage, ten yards in 
breadth, led up to the platform on 
which the tents were pitched. It was 
strongly secured by a palisade on 
each side, as was the esplanade in 
front of the pavilions, and the whole 
was guarded by men-at-arms. 
The northern access to the lists 
terminated in a similar entrance of 
thirty feet in breadth, at the extremity 
of which was a large inclosed space 
for such knights as might be disposed 
to enter the lists with the challengers, 
behind which were placed tents con- 
taining refreshments of every kind 
for their accommodation, with ar- 
morers, farriers, and other attendants, 
in readiness to give their services 
wherever they might be necessary. 
The exterior of the lists was in part 
occupied by temporary galleries, 
spread with tapestry and carpets, and 
accommodated with cushions for the 
convenience of those ladies and nobles 
who were expected to attend the 
tournament. A narrow space be- 
twixt these galleries and the lists gave 
accommodation for yeomanry and 
spectators of a better degree than the 
mere vulgar, and might be compared 
12, Conqueror, William the Conqueror. to the pit of a theater. | 
cuous multitude arranged 
upon large banks of turf | 
the purpose, which, aic 
natural elevation of the .-- 
abled them to overlook the galleries 
and obtain a fair view into the lists. 
Besides the accommodation which 
these stations afforded, many hun- 
dreds had perched themselves on the 
branches of the trees which surrounded 
the meadow; and even the steeple of a # 
country church, at some distance, was 
crowded with spectators. _ 
It only remains to notice respecting 
the general arrangement, that one 
gallery in the very center of the eastern 
side of the lists, and consequently 
exactly opposite to the spot where 
the shock of the combat was to take 
place, was raised higher than the 
others, more richly decorated, and » 
graced by a sort of throne and canopy, 
on which the royal arms were em- 
blazoned. Squires, pages, and yeo- 
men in rich liveries waited around this 
place of honor, which was designed for 
Prince John and his attendants. Op- 
posite to this royal gallery was another, 
elevated to the same height, on the 
western side of the lists; and more 
gaily, if less sumptuously, decorated » 
than that destined for the Prince 
himself. A train, of pages and of 
young maidens, the most beautiful 
who could be selected, gaily dressed in 
fancy habits of green and pink, sur- 
rounded a throne decorated in the 
same colors. Among pennons and 
flags bearing wounded hearts, burn- 
ing hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and 
quivers, and all the commonplace # 
emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a 
blazoned inscription informed the spec- 
tators that this seat of honor was de- 
signed for La Royne de la Beaulté et des 
Amours, But who was to represent

the Queen of Beauty and of Love on 
the present occasion no one was pre- 
pared. to guess. 
Meanwhile, spectators of every de- 
scription thronged forward to occupy 
their respective stations, and not with- 
out many quarrels concerning those 
which they were entitled to hold. 
Some of these were settled by the men- 
at-arms with brief ceremony; the 
shafts of their battle-axes and pum- 
mels of their swords being readily em- 
ployed as arguments to convince the 
more refractory. Others, which in- 
volved the rival claims of more ele- 
vated persons, were. determined by 
the heralds, or by the two marshals of 
the field, William de Wyvil and 
Stephen de Martival, who, armed at all 
points, rode up and down the lists to 
enforce and preserve good order among 
the spectators. 
Gradually the galleries became filled 
with knights and nobles, in their 
robes of peace, whose long and rich- 
tinted mantles were contrasted with 
the gayer and more splendid habits of 
the ladies, who, in a greater proportion 
than even the men _ themselves, 
thronged to witness a sport which 
one would have thought too bloody 
and dangerous to afford their sex 
much pleasure. The lower and in- 
terior space was soon filled by sub- 
stantial yeomen and burghers, and 
such of the lesser gentry as, from 
modesty, poverty, or dubious title 
durst not assume any higher place. 
It was of course amongst these that 
the most frequent disputes for preced- 
ence occurred. 
“Dog of an unbeliever,” said an 
old man, whose threadbare tunic bore 
witness to his poverty, as his sword, 
and dagger, and golden chain inti- 
mated his pretensions to rank—‘‘whelp 
of a she-wolf! darest thou press upon 
a Christian, and a Norman gentleman 
of the blood of Montdidier?” 353 
This rough expostulation was: ad- 50 
dressed to no other than our acquaint- 
ance Isaac, who, richly and even 
magnificently dressed in a gaberdine 
ornamented with lace and lined with 
fur, was endeavoring to make place 
in the forémost row beneath the 
gallery for his daughter, the beautiful 
Rebecca, who had joined him at 
Ashby, and who was now hanging on 
her father’s arm, not a little terrified 
by the popular displeasure which 
seemed generally excited by her par- 
ent’s presumption. But Isaac, though 
we have seen him sufficiently timid on 
other occasions, knew well that at 
present he had nothing to fear. It 
was not in places of general resort, 
or where their equals were assembled, 
that any avaricious or malevolent 
noble durst offer him injury. At 
such meetings the Jews were under 
the protection of the general law; 
and if that proved a weak assurance, 
it usually happened ‘that there were 
among the persons assembled some 
barons who, for their own interested 
motives, were ready to act as, their 
protectors. On the present occasion, 
Isaac felt more than usually confi- 
dent, being aware that Prince John 
was even then in the very act of 
negotiating a large loan from the Jews 
of York, to be secured upon certain 
jewels and lands. Isaac’s own share 
in this transaction was considerable, 
and he well knew that the Prince’s 
eager desire to bring it to a conclusion 
would ensure him his protection in 
the dilemma in which he stood. 
Emboldened by these considera- 
tions, the Jew pursued his point, and 
jostled the Norman Christian without 
respect, either to his descent, quality, 
or religion. The complaints of the old 
man, however, excited the indignation 
of the bystanders. One of these, a 
stout, well-set yeoman, arrayed in 
Lincoln green, having twelve arrows 
  gz é &
-P-A-G-E-363
10 354 
stuck in his belt, with a baldric and 
badge of silver, and a bow of six feet 
Jength in his hand, turned short round, 
and while his countenance, which his 
constant exposure to weather had 
rendered brown as a hazelnut, grew 
darker with anger, he advised the 
Jew to remember that all the wealth 
he had acquired by sucking the blood 
of his miserable victims had but 
swelled him like a bloated spider, 
which might be overlooked while it 
kept in a corner, but would be crushed 
if it ventured into the light. This in- 
timation, delivered in Norman-English 
with a firm voice and a stern aspect, 
made the Jew shrink back; and he 
would have probably withdrawn him- 
self altogether from a vicinity so dan- 
gerous, had not the attention of every- 
one been called to the sudden entrance 
of Prince John, who at that moment 
entered the lists, attended by a nu- 
merous and gay train, consisting 
partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, 
as light in their dress, and as gay in 
their demeanor, as their companions. 
Among the latter was the Prior of 
Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim 
which a dignitary of the church could 
venture to exhibit.’ Fur and gold were 
not. spared in his garments; and the 
point of his boots, out-Heroding the 
preposterous fashion of the time, 
turned up so very far as to be attached 
not to his knees merely, but to his 
very girdle, and effectually preventing 
him from putting his foot into the 
stirrup. This, however, was a slight 
inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, 
who, perhaps even rejoicing in the 
opportunity to display his accom- 
plished horsemanship before so many 
spectators, especially of the fair sex, 
dispensed with the use of these sup- 
ports to a timid rider. The rest of 
Prince John’s retinue consisted of the 
favorite leaders of his mercenary 
33. out-Heroding, overdoing. LEGEND AND HISTORY 
troops, some marauding barons and 
profligate attendants upon the court, 
with several Knights Templars and 
Knights of St. John. 
It may be here remarked that the 
knights of these two orders were 
accounted hostile to King Richard, 
having adopted the side of Philip of 
France in the long train of disputes 
which took place in Palestine betwixt 
that monarch and the lion-hearted 
King of England. It was the well- 
known consequence of this discord 
that Richard’s repeated victories had 
been rendered fruitless, his romantic 
attempts to besiege Jerusalem dis- 
appointed, and the fruit of all the 
glory which he had acquired had 
dwindled into an uncertain truce with 
the Sultan Saladin. With the same 
policy which had dictated the conduct 
of their brethren in the Holy Land, 
the Templars and Hospitalers | in 
England and Nor . 
themselves to the |

  stones, from which his long curled hair 
escaped and overspread his shoulders, 
Prince John, upon a gray and high- 
mettled palfrey, caracoled within the 
lists at the head of his jovial party, 
laughing loud with his train, and eye- 
ing with all the boldness of royal 
criticism the beauties who adorned 
the lofty galleries. 
Those who remarked in the physi- 
ognomy of the Prince a dissolute 
audacity, mingled with extreme 
haughtiness and indifference to the 
feelings of others, could not yet deny 
to his countenance that sort of come- 
liness which belongs to an open set of 
eled by art to the usual rules of cour- 
tesy, yéet so far frank and honest that 
they seemed as if they disclaimed to 
conceal the natural workings of the 
soul. Such an expression is often 
mistaken for manly frankness, when 
in truth it arises from the reckless in- 
difference of a libertine disposition, 
conscious of superiority of birth, of 
wealth, or of some other adventitious 
advantage, totally unconnected with 
personal merit. To those who did 
not think so deeply, and they were 
the greater number by a hundred to 
one, the splendor of Prince John’s 
sheno (i. e., fur tippet), the richness 
of his cloak, lined with the most 
costly sables, his maroquin boots and 
golden spurs, together with the grace 
with which he managed his palfrey, 
were sufficient to merit clamorous 
applause. 
In his joyous caracole round the 
lists, the attention of the Prince was 
called by the commotion, not yet 
subsided, which had attended the 
ambitious movement of Isaac toward 
the higher places of the assembly. 
The quick eye of Prince John in- 
stantly recognized the Jew, but was 
much more agreeably attracted by

features, well formed by nature, mod- 355 
the beautiful daughter of Zion, who, 
terrified by the tumult,’ clung close 
to the arm of her aged father. 50 
The figure of Rebecca might indeed 
have compared with the proudest . 
beauties of England, even though it 
had been judged by as shrewd a 
connoisseur as Prince John. Her form 
was exquisitely symmetrical, and was 
shown to advantage by a sort of 
Eastern dress, which she wore ac- 
cording to the fashion of the females of 
her nation. Her turban of yellow silk 
suited well with the darkness of her 
complexion. The brilliancy of her 
eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, 
her well-formed aquiline nose, her 
teeth as white as pearl, and the pro- 
fusion of her sable tresses, which, each 
arranged in its own little spiral of 
twisted curls, fell down upon as much 
of a lovely neck and bosom as a 
simarre of the richest Persian silk, 
exhibiting flowers in their natural 
colors embossed upon a purple ground, 
permitted to be visible—all these con- 
stituted a combination of loveliness 
which yielded not to the most beauti- 
ful of the maidens who surrounded 
her. It is true, that of the golden 
and pearl-studded clasps which closed 
her vest from the throat to the waist, 
the three uppermost were left un- 
fastened on account of the heat, which 
something enlarged the prospect to 
which we allude. A diamond neck- 
lace, with pendants of inestimable 
value, was by this means also made 
more conspicuous. The feather of an 
ostrich, fastened in her turban by an 
agraffe set with brilliants, was another 
distinction of the beautiful Jewess, 
scoffed and sneered at by the proud 
dames who sat above her, but secretly 
envied by those who affected to deride 
them. 
“By the bald scalp of Abraham,” 
said Prince John, “yonder Jewess 
71. simarre, loose, light robe. 89. agraffe, clasp. 90

must be the very model of that per- 
fection whose charms drove frantic 
the wisest king that ever lived! What 
sayest thou, Prior Aymer? By the 
Temple of that wise king, which our 
wiser brother Richard proved unable 
to recover, she is the very Bride of 
the Canticles!” 
“The Rose of Sharon and the Lily 
of the Valley,” answered the Prior, 
in a sort of snuffling tone; “but your 
Grace must remember she is still 
but a Jewess.”” 
“Aye!” added Prince John, without 
heeding him, “and there is my Mam- 
mon of unrighteousness too—the Mar- 
quis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants, 
contesting for place with penniless 
dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have 
not a single cross in their pouches to 
keep the devil from dancing there. 
By the body of St. Mark, my prince 
of supplies, with his lovely Jewess, 
shall have a place in the gallery! 
What is she, Isaac? Thy wife or 
thy daughter, that Eastern houri 
that thou lockest under thy arm as 
thou wouldst thy treasure-casket?” 
“My daughter Rebecca, so please 
your Grace,” answered Isaac, with a 
low congee, nothing embarrassed by 
the Prince’s salutation, in which, how- 
ever, there was at least as much 
mockery as courtesy. 
“The wiser man thou,” said Jpbn, 
with a peal of laughter, in which his 
gay followers obsequiously joined. 
“But, daughter or wife, she should be 
preferred according to her beauty and 
thy merits. Who sits above there?” 
he continued, bending his eye on the 
gallery. “Saxon churls, lolling at 
their lazy length! Out upon them!

Those who occupied the gallery, to 5 
whom this injurious and -unpolite 
speech was addressed, were the family 
of Cedric the Saxon, with that of his 
ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Con- 
ingsburgh, a personage who, on 
account of his descent from the last 
Saxon monarchs of England, was held 
in the highest respect by all the Saxon 
natives of the north of England. But 
with the blood of this ancient royal 0 
race many of their infirmities had 
descended to Athelstane. He was — 
comely in countenance, bulky and 
strong in person, and in the flower of 
his age; yet inanimate in expression, 
dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and 
sluggish i in all his motions, and so slow 
in resolution that the soubriquet of 
one of his ancestors was conferred 
upon him, and he was very generally 7 
called Athelstane the Unready. His 
friends—and he had many who, as 
well as Cedric, were passionately at- 
tached to him—contended that this 
sluggish temper arose not from want 
of courage, but from mere want of 
decision; others alleged that his 
hereditary vice of drunkenness had 
obscured his faculties, never of a very 
acute order, and that the passive 80 
courage and meek good nature which 
remained behind avere merely the dregs 
of a character that might have been 
deserving of praise, but of which all 
the valuable parts had flown off in 
the progress of a long course of brutal 
debauchery. 
It was to this person, such as we 
have described him, that the Prince 
addressed his imperious command to 1

sulting, unwilling to obey, yet un- 
determined how to resist, opposed 
only the vis inerti¢ to the will of John; 
and, without stirring or making any 
motion whatever of obedience, opened 
his large gray eyes and stared at the 
Prince with an astonishment which 
had in it something extremely lu- 
dicrous. But the impatient John re- 
garded it in no such light. 
“The Saxon porker,’”’ he said, “is 
either asleep or minds me not. Prick 
him with your lance, De Bracy,” 
speaking to a knight who rode near 
him, the leader of a band of free 
companions, or condottieri: that is, of 
mercenaries belonging to no particular 
nation, but attached for the time to 
any prince by whom they were paid. 
» There was a murmur even among the 
attendants of Prince John; but De 
| Bracy, whose profession freed him 
from all scruples, extended his long

| the gallery from the lists, and would 
have executed the commands of the 
Prince before Athelstane the Unready 
had recovered presence of mind suffi- 
cient even to draw back his person 
3% from the weapon, had not Cedric, as 
prompt as his companion was tardy, 
unsheathed with the speed of light- 
ning, the short sword which he wore, 
and at a single blow severed the point 
of the lance from the handle. The 
blood rushed into the countenance of 
Prince John. He swore one of his 
deepest oaths, and was about to utter 
some threat corresponding in violence, 
# when he was diverted from his pur- 
pose, partly by his own attendants, 
who gathered around him conjuring 
him to be patient, partly by a general 
exclamation of the crowd, uttered in 
loud applause of the spirited conduct 
of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes 
in indignation, as if to collect some 
safe and easy victim; and chancing 
3 vis inertise, sluggishness, 857 
_to encounter the firm glance of the 
same archer whom we have already 
noticed, and who seemed to persist 
in his gesture of applause, in spite of 
the frowning aspect which the Prince 
bent upon him, he demanded his 
reason for clamoring thus. 
“TI always add my hollo,” said the 
yeoman, “when I see a good shot or 
a gallant blow.” 
“Sayst thou?” answered the Prince. 
“Then thou canst hit the white thy- 
self, [ll warrant.” / 
“A woodsman’s mark, and at woods- 
man’s distance, I can hit,” answered 
the yeoman. . 
“And. Wat Tyrrel’s mark, at a 
hundred yards,” said a voice from 
behind, but by whom uttered could 
not be discerned. 
This allusion to the fate of William 
Rufus, his relative, at once incensed 
and alarmed Prince John. He satis- 
fied himself, however, with command. 
ing the men-at-arms, who surrounded 
the lists, to keep an eye on the brag- 
gart, pointing to the yeoman. 
“By St. Grizzel,” he added, “we 
will try his own skill, who is so ready 
to give his voice to the feats of others!” 
“T shall not fly the trial,” said the 
yeoman, with the composure which 
marked his whole deportment. 
“Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon 
churls,” said the fiery Prince; “for, 
by the light of Heaven, since I have 
said it, the Jew shall have his seat 
amongst ye!” 
“By no means, an it please your 
Grace! It is not fit for such as we 
to sit with the rulers of the land,” 
said the Jew, whose ambition for 
precedence, though it had led him to 
dispute place with the extenuated and 
impoverished descendant of the line 
of Montdidier, by no means stimu- 
lated him to an intrusion upon the 
privileges of the wealthy Saxons.

“Up, infidel dog, when I command 
you,” said Prince John, “or I will 
have thy swarthy hide stripped off and 
tanned for horse-furniture!”’ 
Thus urged, the Jew began to 
ascend the steep and narrow steps 
which led up to the gallery. 
“Let me see,”’ said the Prince, “who 
dare stop him!” fixing his eye on 
Cedric, whose attitude intimated his 
intention to hurl the Jew down head- 
long. 
The catastrophe was prevented by 
the clown Wamba, who, springing 
betwixt his master and Isaac, and 
exclaiming, in answer to the Prince’s 
defiance, “Marry, that will I!’ op- 
posed to the beard of the Jew a shield 
of brawn, which he plucked from 
beneath his cloak, and with which, 
doubtless, he had furnished himself 
lest the tournament should have 
proved longer than his appetite could 
endure abstinence. Finding the abom- 
ination of his tribe opposed to his very 
nose, while the Jester at the same 
time flourished his wooden sword 
above his head, the Jew recoiled, 
missed his footing, and rolled down 
the steps—an excellent jest to the 
spectators, who set up a loud laughter, 
in which Prince John and his attend- 
ants heartily joined. 
“Deal me the prize, cousin Prince,” 
said Wamba. “I have vanquished my 
foe in fair fight with sword and shield,” 
he added, brandishing the brawn in

one hand and the wooden sword in tl 
other. “Who and what art thoi 
noble champion?” said Prince Joh 
still laughing. 
“A fool by right of descent,” aii 
swered the Jester; “I am Wamba, tl: 
son of Witless, who was the son | 
Weatherbrain, who was the son of a 
alderman.” . : 
“Make room for the Jew in fro | 
of the lower ring,” said Prince Joh 
not unwilling, perhaps, to seize ¢. |

purpose; “‘to place the vanquishe 
beside the victor were false heraldry 
“‘Knave upon fool were worse,” a 
swered the Jester, “and Jew upu_ 
bacon worst of all.” 
“Gramercy! good fellow,” cried 
Prince John, “thou pleasest me. Here, 
Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.” 
As the Jew, stunned by the request, 
afraid to refuse and unwilling to « 
comply, fumbled in the furred bag 
which hung by his girdle, and was 
perhaps endeavoring to ascertain how 
few coins might pass for a handful, 
the Prince stooped from his jennet 
and settled Isaac’s doubts by snatch- 
ing the pouch itself from his side; 
and flinging to Wamba a couple of the 
gold pieces which it contained, he 
pursued his career round the lists, 
leaving the Jew to the derision of 
those around him, and himself re- 
ceiving as much applause from the 
spectators as if he had done some 
honest and honorable action. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notss 
Setting, Merry England; Time, Latter Part 
of the Twelfth Century; Conditions: 
a, Political. King Richard, after leading vari- 
ous crusading expeditions to Palestine, is in 
captivity in Europe. Prince John, Richard’s 
brother, is temporary king of England. Petty 
warfares are waged among the nobles. Prince 
John is plotting to usurp the kingdom. b. Social. The feudal system, under which 
the king owns all the land and grants it in fief to 
his nobles, is the prevailing social order, The 
chief classes, or “castes,” are: Norman nobles 
(superior gentry); Saxon franklins (inferior gen- 
try); Squires (in line of rank for knighthood); 
Freemen (tenants on large estates); Serfs, or 
slaves (menials and jesters); Outlaws (mostly 
Saxons); Jews (money lenders and merchants, 
who are treated as outcasts from society).

c. Religious. There are three groups of re- 
ligious characters: (1) Knights Templars (mili- 
tary churchmen), including the Grand Master, ~ 
Preceptors, Knights, Squires, and Menials 
(mostly Saracens); (2) Churchmen (non-mili- 
tary), including Priors, Monks, Hermits, and 
Pilgrims; and (3) Jews. 
d. General, Corruption exists among both 
nobles and churchmen; there is lack of justice 
and disregard of law everywhere; narrow social 
andreligious prejudices stimulate hatred between 
Normans and Saxons, and hatred and oppression 
of Jews by Christians; the nobles are heavily 
indebted to the Jews; means of travel, transpor- 
tation, and communication are poor; and there 
are few large cities. 
Questions anp ToPics 
1. This chapter describes conditions in Eng- 
land; what facts do you gather of the political, 
the social, and the religious situations? Make 
a blackboard sketch of the lists, showing the 
location of the five pavilions, the entrances, and 
the different galleries. 
2. Tell the events related in this chapter, us- 
ing the following outline: (a) entrance of 
Isaac and Rebecca; (b) arrival of Prince John; 
(c) Prince John’s insult of Saxons and Jews, 
noting the parts played by De Bracy, the bold 
yeoman, and Wamba. 
3. Find passages that describe the appearance 
and character of Prince John, Rebecca, Athel- 
stane, and the yeoman. Why did the Knights 
Templars and Hospitalers attach themselves 
to Prince John? Why was Isaac of York sure 
that Prince John would protect him?

EXTRACTS FROM ! 
THE LIFE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT 
Joun Gipson Locxuart 
I. Scorr anp His CHILDREN 
[These extracts give an intimate picture 
* of Scott’s family life.] 
I ought to say a few words on 
Scott’s method of treating his children 
in their early days. He had now two 
boys and two girls; and he never had 
more. He was not one of those who 
take much delight in a mere infant, 
_ but no father ever devoted more time = So and tender care to his offspring than 
he did to each of his, as they reached 
the age when they could listen to 
him and understand his talk. Like 
their playmates, Camp and the grey- 
hounds, they had at all times free 
access to his study; he never con- 
sidered their prattle as any dis- 
turbance; they went and came as 
pleased their fancy; he was always 
ready to: answer their questions; and 
when they, unconscious how he was 
engaged, entreated him to lay down 
his pen and tell them a story, he 
would take them on his knee, repeat 
a ballad or a legend, kiss them, and 
set them down again to their marbles 
or ninepins, and resume his labor, as if 
refreshed by the interruption. From 
a very early age he made them dine 
at table, and “to sit up to supper” 
was the great reward when they had 
been “very good bairns.” In short, 
he considered it as the highest duty, 
as well as the sweetest pleasure, of a 
parent to be the companion of his 
children; he partook all their little 
joys and sorrows, and made his kind, 
informal instructions to blend so easily and playfully with the current 
of their own sayings and doings that | 
so far from regarding him with any 
distant awe, it was never thought 4 
that any sport or diversion could go on 
in the right way, unless “papa” were 
of the party, or that the rainiest day 
could be dull, so he were at home. 
Of the irregularity of his own edu- 
cation he speaks with regret, in the 
autobiographical fragment written this 
year at Ashestiel; yet his practice does 
not look as if that feeling had been 
strongly rooted in his mind, for he » 
never did show much concern about 
regulating systematically what is usu- 
ally called “education” in the case of 
his children. It seemed, on the con- 
trary, as if he attached little impor- 
tance to anything else, so he could 
perceive that the young curiosity was 
excited—the intellect, by whatever 
springs of interest, set in motion. 
He detested and despised the whole 
generation of modern children’s books, 
in which the attempt is made to 
convey accurate notions of scientific 
minutiz; delighting cordially, on the 
other hand, in those of the preceding 
age, which, addressing themselves 
chiefly to the imagination, obtain 
through it, as he believed, the best 
chance of stirring our graver faculties 
also. He exercised the memory by 
selecting for tasks of recitation pas- 
sages of popular verse the most likely 
to catch the fancy of children; and 
gradually familiarized them with the

ancient history of their own country, 
by: arresting attention, in the course 
of his own oral narrations, on inci- 
dents and characters of a similar de- 
scription. Nor did he neglect to use 
the same means of quickening curiosity 
as to the events of sacred history. On 
Sundays he never rode—at least not 
until his growing infirmity made his 
10 pony almost necessary to him—for 
jit was his principle that all domestic 
animals have a full right to their 
Sabbath of rest; but after he had read 
the prayers and lessons of the day, 
he usually walked with his whole 
family, dogs included, to some fa- 
vorite spot at a considerable distance 
from the house—most frequently the 
ruined tower of Elibank—and there 
» dined with them in the open air on a 
basket of cold provisions, mixing hi 
wine with the water of the brook 
beside which they all were grouped 
around him on the turf; and here, or 
at home, if the weather kept them. 
from their ramble, his Sunday talk 
was just such a series of Biblical 
lessons as that which we have pre- ° 
served for the permanent use of rising 
2. generations, in his Tales of a Grand- 
father on the early history of Scot- 
land. I wish he had committed that 
other, series to writing, too—how dif- 
ferent that would have been from 
our thousand compilations of. dead 
epitome and imbecile cant! He had 
his Bible, the Old Testament espe- 
cially, by heart; and on these days 
inwove the simple pathos or sublime 
40 enthusiasm of Scripture, in whatever 
story he was telling, with the same 
picturesque richness as in his week- 
day tales the quaint Scotch of Pit- 
scottie, or some rude romantic old 
rime from Barbour’s Bruce or Blind 
Harry’s Wallace.

He. delighted to hear his daughters: 
sing an old ditty, or one of his own 
. framing; but, so the singer appeared 
to feel the spirit of her ballad, he was 
not at all critical of the technical 
execution. There was one thing, how- 
ever, on which he fixed his heart 
hardly less than the ancient Persians 
of the Cyropedia; like them, next to 
love of truth, he held love of horse- 
manship for the prime point of educa-, 
tion. As soon as his eldest girl could 
sit a pony, she was made the regular 
attendant of his mountain rides; and . 
they all, as they attained sufficient 
strength, had the like advancement. 
He taught them to think nothing of 
tumbles, and habituated them to his 
own reckless delight in perilous fords 
and flooded streams; and they all 
imbibed in great perfection his passion 
for horses—as well, I may venture to 
add, as his deep reverence for the 
more important article of that Persian 
training. “Without courage,” he said, 
“there cannot be truth; and without 
truth there can be no other virtue.” 
Il. Scorr ar Work 
[These selections give you an oppor- 
tunity of watching Sir Walter at work 
upon two of his poems.] 
“T had formed,” he [Scott] says, 
“the prudent resolution to bestow 
a little more labor than I had yet 
done, and to be in no hurry again to 
announce myself as a candidate for 
literary fame. Accordingly, particu- 
lar passages of a poem which was 
finally called Marmion were labored 
with a good deal of care by one by 
whom much care was seldom be- 
stowed. Whether the work was worth

the labor or not, I am no competent 
judge; but I may be permitted to say 
that the period of its composition was 
a very happy one in my life; so much 
so, that I remember with pleasure at 
this moment (1830) some of the spots 
‘in which particular passages were 
composed.” ‘The first four of the 
Introductory Epistles are dated Ashe- 
wo stiel, and they point out very dis- - 
tinctly some of these spots. There is 
a knoll with some tall old ashes on the 
adjoining farm of the Peel, where he 
was very fond of sitting by himself, 
and it still bears the name of the 
“Sheriff's Knowe.” Another favorite 
seat was beneath a huge oak hard by 
the river, at the extremity of the haugh 
of Ashestiel. It was here that while 
20 meditating his verses he used 
To waste the solitary, day 
, In plucking from yon fen the reed, 
And watch it floating down the Tweed. 
He frequently wandered far from 
. home, however, attended only by his 
dog, and. would return late in the 
evening, having let hour after hour 
slip away among the soft and melan- 
choly wildernesses where Yarrow 
30 creeps from her fountains. The lines,

it over brake and fell at the full speed 
of his Lieutenant. I well remember 
his saying, as I rode with him across 
the hills from Ashestiel to Newark 
one day in his declining years, “Oh, 
man, I had many a grand gallop 
among these braes when I was think- 5 
ing of Marmion, but a trotting, canny 
pony must serve nie now.” 
Mr. Skene, however, informs me 
that many of the more energetic de- 
scriptions, and particularly that of the 
battle of Flodden, were struck out 
while he was in quarters again with 
his cavalry, in the autumn of 1807. 
“In the intervals of drilling,” he says, 
“Scott used to delight in walking his « 
powerful black steed up and down 
by himself upon the Portobello sands, 
within the beating of the surge; and 
now and then you would see him 
plunge in his spurs, and go off as if 
at the charge, with the spray dashing 
about him. As we rode back to 
Musselburgh, he often came and 
placed himself beside me, to repeat 
the verses that he had been composing 0 
during these pauses of our exercise.” 
Mr. Guthrie Wright, who was 
among the familiar associates of the 
Troop, has furnished me with some 
details which throw light on the con- 
struction of Marmion, This gentle- 
man had, through Scott’s good offices, 
succeeded his brother Thomas in the 
charge of the Abercorn business. “In 
the summer of 1807,” he says, “I had # 
the pleasure of making a trip with 
Sir Walter to Dumfries, for the pur- 
pose of meeting Lord Abercorn on his 
way to Ireland. His Lordship did 
not arrive for two or three days, and

Castle, and some other ancient build- 
ings in the neighborhood. He recited 
poetry and old legends from morn 
till night; and it is impossible that 
anything could be more delightful 
than his society; but what I particu- 
larly allude to is the circumstance, 
that at that time he was writing 
Marmion, the three or four first 
10 cantos of which he had with him, and 
which he was so. good as to read to me. 
It is unnecessary to say how much 
I was enchanted with them; but as 
he good-naturedly asked me to state 
any observations that occurred to me, 
I said in joke that it, appeared to me 
he had brought his hero by a very 
strange route into Scotland. ‘Why,’ 
says I, ‘did ever mortal coming from 
20 England to Edinburgh go by, Gifford, 
Crichton Castle, Borthwick Castle, 
and over the top of Blackford Hill? 
Not only is it a circuitous detour, but 
there never was a road that way since 
the world was created!’ ‘That is a 
| most irrelevant objection,’ said Sir 
Walter; ‘it was my good pleasure to 
| bring Marmion by that route for the 
purpose of describing the places you 
30 have mentioned, and the view from 
| Blackford Hill—it was his business 
to find his road and pick his steps the 
best way he could. But, pray, how 
would you have me bring him? Not 
by the post-road, surely, as if he had 
been traveling in a mail-coach?’ ‘No,’ 
I replied; ‘there were neither post- 
roads nor mail-coaches in those days; 
but I think you might have brought 
40 him with a less chance of getting into 
a swamp, by allowing him to travel 
the natural route by Dunbar and the 
seacoast; and then he might have 
tarried for a space with the famous 
Earl of Angus, surnamed Bell-the-Cat, 
at his favorite residence of Tantallon 
Castle, by which means you would 
have had not only that fortress with all 
his feudal followers, but the Castle of Dunbar, the Bass, and all the beautiful 50 
scenery of the Forth to describe.’ 
This observation seemed to strike him 
_tauch, and after a pause he exclaimed, 
‘By Jove, you are right! I ought to 
have. brought him that way’; and he 
added, ‘But before he and I part, 
depend upon it, he shall visit Tan- 
tallon.’” He then asked if I had ever 
been there, and upon saying I had 
frequently, he desired me to describe 60 
it, which I did; and I verily believe it 
is from what I then said that the ac- 
curate description contained in the 
fifth Canto was given—at least I 
never heard him say he had after- 
wards gone to visit the castle; and 
when the poem was published, I re- 
member he laughed, and asked me how 
Lliked Tantallon.” _ 
Just a year had elapsed from his 70 
beginning the poem, when he penned 
the Epistle for Canto IV at Ashestiel; 
and who, that considers how busily 
his various pursuits and labors had 
been crowding the interval, can won- 
der to be told that 
Even now, it scarcely seems a day 
Since first I tuned this idle lay— 
A task so often laid aside 
When leisure graver cares denied— 80 
That now November’s dreary gale, 
Whose voice inspired my opening tale, 
That same November gale once more 
Whirls the dry leaves on Yarrow shore. 
The fifth Introduction was written 
in Edinburgh in the month following; 
that to the last Canto, during the 
Christmas festivities of Mertoun- 
house, where, from the first days of 
his ballad-riming to the close of his 90 
life, he, like his bearded ancestor, 
usually spent that season with the 
immediate head of the race. The 
bulky appendix of notes, including 
a mass of curious antiquarian quota- 
tions, must have moved somewhat 
slowly through the printers’ hands; 
but Marmion was at length ready for

publication by the middle of February, 
1808. 
* = * 
On his way back to Scotland, he 
[Scott] spent some days more with 
Morritt, at Rokeby Park, on the 
northern boundary of Yorkshire; and 
he was so delighted by the scenery of 
the rivers Tees and Greta, which 
have their confluence within the 
demesne, and so interested with his 
host’s traditionary anecdotes ‘of the 
Cavaliers of the Rokeby lineage, that 
he resolved on connecting a poem with 
these fair landscapes. But he had 
already, I presume, begun The Lady 
of the Lake: for, on his arrival at 
Edinburgh, he undertook that it should 
be finished by the end of the year. In 
July he revisited all the localities so 
dear to him in the days of his ju- 
venile rambling, which he had chosen 
for the scene of his fable. He gave 
a week to Cambusmore, and ascer- 
tained, in his own person, that a good 
horseman might gallop from Loch 
Vannachar to Stirling within the 
space allotted to Fitz-James. He 
then, under the guidance of Mr. 
Macdonald Buchanan, explored Loch 
Lomond, Arrochar, Loch Sloy, and 
all the scenery of a hundred conflicts 
between the Macfarlanes, the Col- 
quhouns, and the Clan Alpine. At 
Buchanan House, which is very near 
Ross Priory, Lady Douglas and Lady 
Louisa Stuart were visiting the Duke 
of Montrose; he joined them there, , 
and read to them the Stag Chase, 
which he had just completed under 
the full influence of the genius loci. 
Early in May The Lady of the Lake 
came out—as her two elder sisters 
had done—in all the majesty of

grace of typography, and with, more-

Saxon’s portrait of Scott; the price 
of the book two guineas. For the 
copyright the poet had ‘nominally 
received 2000 guineas, but as John » 
Ballantyne and Co. retained three- 
fourths of the property to themselves 
—Miller of London purchasing the 
other fourth—the author’s profits 
were, or should have been, more than 
this. 
Mr. Cadell, the publisher of this 
Memoir, then a young man in train- 
ing for his profession, retains a strong 
impression of the interest which the o 
quarto excited before it was on the 
counter. “James Ballantyne,” he says, 
“read the cantos from time to time 
to select coteries, as they advanced at 
press. Common fame was loud in 
their favor; a great poem was on all 
hands anticipated. I do not recollect 
that any of all the author’s works 
was ever looked for with more intense - 
anxiety, or that any one of them ex- 1 
cited a more extraordinary sensation 
when it did appear. The whole 
country rang with the praises of the 
poet—crowds set off to view the 
scenery of Loch Katrine, till then 
comparatively unknown; and as_ the 
book came out just before the season 
for excursions, every house and inn in 
that neighborhood was crammed with 
a constant succession of visitors. It 
is a well-ascertained fact that from 
the date of the publication of The 
Lady of the Lake, the post-horse duty 
in Scotland rose in an extraordinary 
degree, and indeed it continued to 
do so regularly for a number of years, 
the author’s succeeding works keeping 
up the enthusiasm for our scenery 
which he had thus originally creat: 
Mr. Cadell adds that four 8vo editions 
followed the quarto within the space 
of twelve months; that these carried 
the early sale to 20,000 copies; and 
that by July, 1836, the legitimate sale

in Great Britain had been not less 
than 50,000 copies; since which date 
I understand that, in spite of legal 
and illegal piracies, the fair demand 
has been well kept up. 
In their reception of this work, the 
critics were for once in full harmony 
with each other, and with the popular 
voice. The article in the Quarterly 
was written by George Ellis; but its 
eulogies, though less discriminative, 
are not a whit more emphatic than 
those of Mr. Jeffrey in the rival 
Review. Indeed, I have always con- 
sidered this last paper as the best 
specimen of contemporary criticism 
on Scott’s poetry. The Lay, if I 
may venture to state the creed now 
established, is, I should say, generally 
considered as the most natural and 
original, Marmion as the most power- 
ful and splendid, The Lady of the Lake 
3 the most interesting, romantic, 
icturesque, and graceful of his great _ 
ems. 
Of its success he speaks as follows 
1 1830: “It was certainly so extraor- 
inary as to induce me for the moment 
> conclude that I had at last fixed a 
ail in the proverbially inconstant 
theel of Fortune. But, as the cele- 
rated John Wilkes is said to have

bat he himself was never a Wilkite, so 
can with honest truth exculpate 
ayself from having been at any time 
. partisan of my own poetry, even 
then it was in the highest fashion 
vith the million.”

confessions. . “T remember,” he says,

was then a very young girl, there by

Sophia, how do you like The Lady of 50

with perfect simplicity, “Oh, I have 
not read it; papa says there’s nothing 
so bad for young people as reading 
bad poetry.’ ” 
In fact, his children in those days 
had no idea of the source of his dis- 
tinction—or .rather, indeed, that his 
position was in any respect different 
from that of other Advocates, Sheriffs, 60 
and Clerks of Session. The eldest boy 
came home one afternoon about this 
time from the High School, with tears 
and blood hardened together upon his 
cheeks. ‘Well, Wat,” said his father, 
“what have you been fighting about 
today?” With that the boy blushed 
and hung his head, and at last stam- 
mered out—that he had been called a

roughly, “but I dinna think there’s

turned out that one or two of his 
companions had dubbed him “The 
Lady of the Lake,” and the phrase so 
was to him incomprehensible, save 
as conveying some imputation on his 
prowess, which he accordingly vin- 
dicated in the usual style of the Yards. 
Of the poem he had never before 
heard. Shortly after, this story having 
got wind, one of Scott’s colleagues 
of the Clerks’ Table said to the boy, 
who was in the home circle called 
“Gilnockie,” from his admiration of 90

About ‘the middle of August, my

we remained there for several weeks, 
during -which I became familiarized 
to Sir Walter Scott’s mode of existence 
( in thé country. The humblest person 
who ‘stayed merely for a short visit 
§ must have departed with the im- 
pression that what he witnessed was 
an occasional variety; that Scott’s 
courtesy prompted him to break in 
upon his habits when he had a stran- 
ger to amuse; but that it was physi- 
cally impossible that the man who was 
writing the Waverley romances at the 
rate of nearly twelve volumes in the 
year could continue, week after week, 
and. thonith after month, to devote 
‘a hardly perceptible fraction

sole sake of the Poet and Novelist . 
himself, whose person they had never 
before seen, and whose voice they 
might never again have an oppor- 
tunity of hearing. No other villa in 
Europe was ever resorted to from the 
same motives, and to anything like 
the same extent, except Ferney; and 
Voltaire never dreamt of being visible 
to his hunters, except for a brief space 
of the day; few of them ever dined 
with him, and none of them seem to 
have slept under his roof. Scott’s 
establishment, on the contrary, re- 
sembled in every particular that of the 
affluent idler, who, because he has 
inherited, or would fain transmit, po- 
litical influence in some province, 
keeps open house—receives as many 
as he has room for, and sees their 
apartments occupied, as soon as they 
vacate them, by another troop of the 
same description. Even on gentle- 
“men guiltless of inkshed, the exercise 
of hospitality upon this sort of scale 
is found to impose a heavy tax; few 
of them, nowadays, think of maintain- 
ing it for any large portion of the year; 
very few indeed below the highest 
rank of the nobility—in whose case 
there is usually a staff of led-captains, 
led-chaplains, ‘servile dandies, and 
-semi-professional talkers and jokers 
from London, to take the chief part 
of the burden. Now, Scott had often 
in his mouth the pithy verses: 
Conversation is but carving: 
Give no more to every guest 
Than he’s able to digest; 
Give him always of the prime, 
And but little at a time; 
Carve to all but just enough, 
Let them neither starve nor stuff; 
And that you may have your due, 
Let your neighbors carve for you;

ways, and in other circles where it 
was possible, furnished a happy ex-

emplification of these rules and regu- 
lations of the Dean of St. Patrick’s. 
But the same sense and benevolence 
which dictated adhesion to them 
among his old friends and acquaint- 
ance rendered it necessary to break 
them when he was receiving strangers 
of the class I have described above at 
Abbotsford; he felt that their coming 
was the best homage they could pay 
to his celebrity, and that it would 
have been as uncourteous in him not 
to give them their fill of his talk, as it 
would be in your everyday lord of 
manors to make his casual guests 
welcome indeed to his venison, but 
keep his grouse-shooting for his im- 
mediate allies and dependents. 
Every now and then he received 
some stranger who was not indisposed 
to take his part in the carving; and 
how good-humoredly he surrendered 
the lion’s share to anyone that seemed 
to covet it—with what perfect pla- 
cidity he submitted to be bored even 
by bores of the first water must have 
excited the admiration of many be- 
sides the daily observers of his pro- 
ceedings. I have heard a spruce Senior 
Wrangler lecture him for half an 
evening on the niceties of the Greek 
epigram; I have heard the poorest of 
all parliamentary blunderers try to 
detail to him the pros and cons of 
what he called the “truck system”; 
and in either case the same bland eye 
watched the lips of the tormentor. 
But, with such ludicrous exceptions, 
Scott was the one object of the Abbots- 
ford pilgrims; and evening followed 
evening only to show him exerting, for 
their amusement, more of animal 
spirits, to say nothing of intellectual 
vigor, than would have been con- 
sidered by any other man in the com- 
pany as sufficient for the whole ex- 
penditure of a week’s existence. Yet

this was not the chief marvel: he 
talked of things that interested him- 
self, because he knew that by doing 
so he should give most pleasure to his 
guests. But how vast was the range 
of subjects on which he could talk with 
unaffected zeal; and with what ad-

to the peculiar history, study, pur-

family conneetions, however remote 
their actual station or style of man- 
ners from his own, were forgotten or 
lost sight of. He had some, even near 
relations, who, except when they 
visited him, rarely if ever found ad- 
mittance to what the haughty dialect 
of the upper world is pleased to desig- 
nate exclusively as “society.” These 
were welcome guests, let who might 
be under that roof; and it was the 
same with many a worthy citizen of 
Edinburgh, habitually moving in an 
obscure circle, who had been in the 
same class with Scott at.the High 
School, or his fellow-apprentice when 
he was proud of earning three-pence a 
page by the use of his pen. To dwell 
on nothing else, it was surely a beau- 
tiful perfection of real universal hu- 
manity and politeness that could en- 
able this great and good man to blend 
guests so multifarious in one group, 
and contrive to make them all equally 
happy with him, with themselves, and 
with each other. 
I remember saying to William Allan 
one morning as the whole party mus- 
tered before the porch after breakfast, 50. 
“A faithful sketch of what you at this ~ 
moment see would be more interesting 
a hundred years hence than the, 
grandest so-called historical picture 
that you will ever exhibit at Somerset 
House”; and my friend agreed with 
me so cordially that I often wondered 
afterwards he had not attempted to 
realize the suggestion. The subject 
ought, however, to have been treated 
conjointly by him (or Wilkie) and 
Edwin Landseer. It was a clear, 
bright September morning, with a 
sharpness in the air that doubled the 
animating influence of the sunshine, 
and all was in readiness for a grand 
coursing match on Newark Hill. The

sport for himself was the stanchest of 
anglers, Mr. Rose; but he, too, was 
there on his shelty, armed with his 
salmon-rod and landing-net, and at- 
tended by his humorous squire Hinves, 
and Charlie Purdie, a brother of Tom, 
in those days the most celebrated 
fisherman of the district. This little 
group of Waltonians, bound for Lord 
Somerville’s preserve, remained loung- 
ing about to witness the start of the - 
main cavalcade. Sir Walter, mounted 
on Sybil, was marshaling the order of 
procession with a huge hunting-whip; 
and, among a dozen frolicsome youths 
and maidens, who seemed disposed to 
laugh at all discipline, appeared, each 
on horseback, each as eager as the 
youngest sportsman in the troop, Sir 
Humphry Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and 
the patriarch of Scottish belles-lettres, 
Henry Mackenzie. The Man of Feel- 
ing, however, was persuaded with 
some difficulty to resign his steed fer 
the present to his faithful negro fol- 
lower, and to join Lady Scott in the

come for his favorite sport of angling, 
and had been practicing it successfully 
with Rose, his traveling companion, 
for two or three days preceding this, 
but he had not prepared for coursing 
fields, or had left Charlie Purdie’s

background; Scott, watching the re- 
treat, repeated with mock pathos the 
first verse of an old pastoral song, 
What will I do gin my hoggie die? 
My joy, my pride, my hoggie! 
My only beast, I had nae mae, 
And wow! but I was vogie! 
—the cheers were redoubled—and the

This pig had taken—nobody could 
tell how—a most sentimental attach- 
ment to Scott, and was constantly 
urging its pretensions to be admitted 
a regular member of his tail along with 
thé greyhounds and terriers; but in- 
deed I remember him suffering another 
summer under the same sort of per- 
tinacity on the part of an affectionate 
hen. I leave the explanation for 
2» philosophers—but such were the facts. 
I have too much respect for the vul- 
garly calumniated donkey to name 
him in the same category of pets with 
the pig and the hen; but a year or two 
after this time, my wife used to drive 
a couple of these animals in a little 
garden chair, and whenever her father 
appeared at the door of our cottage, 
we were sure to see Hannah More and 
30 Lady Morgan, as Anne Scott had 
wickedly christened them, trotting 
from their pasture to lay their ‘noses 
over the paling, and, as Washington 
Irving says of the old white-haired 
hedger with the Parisian snuff-box, 
“to have a pleasant crack with the 
ee to return to the chassé. On 
reaching Newark Castle, we found 
40 Lady Scott, her eldest daughter, and 
the venerable Mackenzie, all busily 
engaged in unpacking a basket that 
had been placed in their carriage, and

company as chose had partaken of 
this refection, the Man of Feeling 
_resumed his pony, and all ascended the 
mountain, duly marshaled at proper 
distances, so as to beat in a broad line 
- over the heather, Sir Walter directing 
the mdvement from the right wing— 
toward Blackandro. Davy, next to 
whom I chanced to be riding, laid his 
whip about the fern like an experienced 
hand, but cracked many a joke, too, up- 
on his own jackboots, and surveying 
the long, eager battalion of bushrangers, 
exclaimed, “‘Good heavens! is it thus 
that I visit the scenery of The Lay of the 
Last Minstrel?” We then kept mutter- 
ing to himself, as his glowing eye—the 
finest and brightest that I ever saw— 
ran over the landscape, some of those 
beautiful lines from the “Conclusion” 
of the Lay:

indeed, did well as long as the course 
was upward, but when puss took down 
the declivity, they halted and breathed. 
themselves upon the kno}l—cheering 
gaily, however, the young people, who 
dashed at full speed past and below 
them. Coursing on such a mountain 
is not like the same sport over a set 
of fine English pastures. There were 
gulfs to be avoided and bogs enough 
to be threaded—many a stiff nag 
stuck fast—many a bold rider meas-

and another stranger to the ground 
besides Davy plunged neck-deep into 
a treacherous well-head, which, till 
they were floundering in it, had borne 
all the appearance of a piece of delicate 
green turf. When Sir Humphry 
emerged from his involuntary bath, 
his habiliments garnished with mud, 
slime, and mangled watercresses, Sir 
Walter received him with a triumphant 
“Encore!” But the philosopher had 
his revenge, for joining soon after- 
wards in a brisk gallop, Scott put 
Sibyl Gray to a leap beyond her 
prowess, and lay humbled in the 
ditch, while Davy, who was better 
mounted, cleared it and him at a 
bound. Happily there was little 
damage done—but no one was sorry 
that the sociable had been detained 
at the foot of the hill. ’ 
I have seen Sir Humphry in many 
places, and in company of many dif- 
ferent descriptions; but never to such 
advantage as at Abbotsford. His host 
and he delighted in each other, and 
the modesty of their mutual admira- 
tion was a memorable spectacle. 
Davy was by nature a poet—and 
Scott, though anything but a philos- 
opher in the modern sense of that 
term, might, I think it very likely, 
have pursued the study of physical 
science with zeal and success, had 
he chanced to fall in with such an in- 
structor as Sir Humphry would have 
been to him, in his early life. Each 
strove to make the other talk—and 
they did so in turn more charmingly 
than I ever heard either on any other 
occasion whatsoever. Scott in his 
romantic narratives touched a deeper 
chord of feeling than usual, when he 
had such a listener as Davy; and 
Davy, when induced to open his views 
upon any question of scientific in- 
terest in Scott’s presence, did so with 
a degree of clear, energetic eloquence, 
and with a flow of imagery and illus- LEGEND AND HISTORY 
tration, of which neither his habitual s 
tone of table-talk (least. of all in 
London), nor any of his prose writ- 
ings, except, indeed, the posthumous 
Consolations of Travel, could suggest 
an adequate notion. I remember 
William Laidlaw whispering to me, 
one night, when their “rapt talk” 
had kept the circle round the fire until 
long after the usual bedtime of 
Abbotsford, “Gude preserve us! this « 
is a very superior occasion! Eh, sirs!” 
he added, cocking his eye like a bird, 
“J wonder if Shakespeare and Bacon 
ever met to screw ilk other up?” | 
Since I have touched on the,subject 
of Sir Walter’s autumnal diversions in 
these his latter years, I may as well 
notice here two annual festivals, when 
sport was made his pretext for assem- 
bling his rural neighbors about him— : 
days eagerly anticipated, and fondly 
remembered by many. One was a 
solemn bout of salmon fishing for the 
neighboring gentry and their families, 
instituted originally, I believe, by 
Lord Somerville, but now, in ‘his 
absence, conducted and presided over 
by the Sheriff. Charles Purdie, Tom’s 
brother, had charge (partly as lessee) 
of the salmon fisheries for three or 
four miles of the Tweed, including all 
the water attached to the lands of 
Abbotsford, Gala, and Allwyn; and 
this festival had been established with 
a view, besides other considerations, 
of recompensing him for the attention 
he always bestowed on any of the 
lairds or their visitors that chose to 
fish, either from the banks or the boat, 
within his jurisdiction. His selection 
of the day, and other precautions, 
generally secured an abundance of 
sport for the great anniversary; and 
then the whole party assembled to 
regale on the newly-caught . prey, 
boiled, grilled, and roasted in every 
variety of preparation, beneath 
78 Sherif, Scott.

grand old ash, adjoining Charlie’s 
cottage at Boldside, on the northern 
margin of the Tweed, about a mile 
above Abbotsford. This banquet took 
place earlier in the day or later, accord- 
ing to circumstances; but it often 
lasted till the harvest moon shone on 
the lovely scene and its revelers. 
Sometimes the evening closed with 
10 a “burning of the water”; and then the 
Sheriff, though now not so agile as 
when he practiced that rough sport in 
the early times of Ashestiel, was sure to 
be one of the party in the boat—held 
a torch, or perhaps took the helm— 
and seemed to enjoy the whole thing 
as heartily as the youngest of his com- 
pany— 
Tis blithe along the midnight tide, 
With stalwart arm the boat to guide— 
On high the dazzling blaze to rear, 
And heedful plunge the barbéd spear; 
Rock, wood, and scar, emerging bright, 
Fling on the stream their ruddy light, 
And from the bank our band appears 
Like Genti armed with fiery spears. 
The other “superior occasion’ came 
later in the season; the 28th of Octo- 
ber, the birthday of Sir Walter’s eldest 
30 son, was, I think, that usually selected 
for the Abbotsford Hunt. This was a 
coursing-field on a large scale, includ- 
ing, with as many of the young gentry 
as pleased to attend, all Scott’s per- 
sonal favorites among the yeomen and 
farmers of the surrounding country. 
The Sheriff always took the field, but 
latterly devolved the command upon 
his good friend Mr. John Usher, the 
4 ex-laird of Toftfield; and he could not 
have had a more skillful or better- 
humored lieutenant. The hunt took 
place either on the moors above the 
Cauldshields’ Loch, or over some of 
the hills on the estate of Gala, and we 
had commonly, ere we returned, hares 
enough to supply the wife of every 
farmer that attended with soup for a 
week following. The whole then dined 
  378 
at Abbotsford, the Sheriff in the chair, 50 
Adam Fergusson croupier, and Dom- 
inie Thompson, of course, chaplain. 
George, by the way, was himself an 
eager partaker in the preliminary 
sport; and now he would favor us with 
a grace, in Burns’s phrase “as long 
as my arm,”’ beginning with thanks 
to the Almighty, who had given man 
dominion over the fowls of the air, and 
the beasts of the field, and expatiating oo 
on this text with so luculent a’com- 
mentary, that Scott, who had been 
fumbling with his spoon long before 
he reached Amen, could not help ex- 
claiming as he sat down, “Well done, 
Mr. George! I think we’ve had every- 
thing but the view holla!” © The com- 
pany, whose onset had been thus de- 
ferred, were seldom, I think, under 
thirty in number, and sometimes they 70 
exceeded forty. The feast was such 
as suited the occasion—a baron of beef 
at the foot of the table, a salted round 
at the head, while tureens of hare- 
soup and hotch-potch extended down 
the center, and such light articles as 
geese, turkeys, a sucking-pig, a singed 
sheep’s head, and the unfailing haggis, 
were set forth by way of side-dishes. 
Blackcock and moorfowl, bushels of so 
snipe, black puddings, white puddings, 
and pyramids of pancakes, formed the 
second course. Ale was the favorite 
beverage during dinner, but there was 
plenty of port and sherry for those 
whose stomachs they suited. The 
quaighs of Glenlivet were tossed off as, 
if they held water. The wine decan- 
ters made a few rounds of the table, 
but the hints for hot punch soon be- 90 
came clamorous. Two or three bowls 
were introduced, and placed under 
the supervision of experienced manu- 
facturers—one of these being usually 
the Ettrick Shepherd—and then the 
business of the evening commenced in

nized at the Horse Guards, had the 
primitive pastoral of ‘““Cowdenknowes”’ 
in sweet perfection; Hogg produced 
“The Women. Folk,” or “The Kye

grinding notes, contrived to make 
everybody delighted whether with the

this being their first vision of the

he appearing as heartily at home in »# 
the scene as if he had been a veritable 
“Dandie” himself—his face radiant, his 
laugh gay as childhood, his chorus 
always ready. And so it proceeded 
until some worthy, who had fifteen or 
twenty miles to ride home, began to 
insinuate that his wife and bairns 
would be getting sorely anxious about 
the fords, and the Dumples and Hod- 
dins were at least heard neighing at 60 
the gate, and it was voted that the 
hour had come for doch an dorrach— 
the stirrup-cup—to wit, a bumper all 
round of the unmitigated “mountain 
dew.” How they all contrived to get 
home in safety, Heaven only knows— 
but I never heard of any serious acci- 
dent except upon one occasion, when 
James Hogg made a bet at starting 
that he would leap over his wall-eyed x 
pony as she stood, and broke his nose 
in this experiment of “o’ervaulting 
ambition.” One comely goodwife, 
far off among the hills, amused Sir 
Walter by telling him, the next time 
he passed her homestead after one of 
these jolly doings, what her husband’s 
first words were when he alighted at 
his own door, “‘Ailie, my woman, I’m 
ready for my bed—and oh, lass,” he 
gallantly added, “I wish I could sleep 
for a towmont, for there’s only ae 
thing in this warld worth living for, 
and that’s the Abbotsford hunt!” 
It may well be supposed that the 
President of the Boldside Festival and 
the Abbotsford Hunt did not omit the 
good old custom of the kirn. Every 
November, before quitting the coun- 
try for Edinburgh, he gave a “harvest

of former days, to all the peasantry

LIFE OF SCOTT 
on his estate, their friends and kindred, 
and as many poor neighbors besides 
as his barn could hold. Here old and 
young danced from sunset to sunrise— 
John of Skye’s bagpipe being relieved 
at intervals by the violin of some Wan- 
dering Willie; and the laird and all his 
family were present during the early 
part of the evening—he and his wife 
10 to distribute the contents of the first 
tub of whisky-punch, and his young 
people to take their due share in the 
endless reels and hornpipes of the 
earthen floor. As Mr. Morritt has 
said of him as he appeared at Laird 
Nippy’s kirn of earlier days, “to wit- 
ness the cordiality of his reception 
might have unbent a misanthrope.” 
He had his private joke for every old 
2 wife or “gausie carle,” his arch com- 
pliment for the ear of every bonny lass, 
and his hand and his blessing for the 
head of every little Eppie Daidle from 
Abbotstown or Broomielees. 
The whole of the ancient ceremonial 
of the daft days, as they are called in 
Scotland, obtained respect at Abbots- 
ford. He said it was uncanny, and 
would certainly have felt it very un- 
30 comfortable, not to welcome the new 
“year in the midst of his family, and a 
few old friends, with the immemorial 
libation of a “het pint”; but of all the 
consecrated ceremonies of the time 
none gave him such delight as the 
: visit which he received as Laird from 
all the children on his estate, on the 
last morning of every December— 
when, in the words of an obscure poet 
40 often quoted by him, 
The cottage bairns sing blithe and ga: 
At the ha’ door for hogmanay. Bey 
The following is from a New-Year’s- 
day letter to Joanna Baillie: 
The Scottish laborer is in his natural 
state perhaps one of the best, most in-

telligent, and kind-hearted of human 
beings; and in truth I have limited my 
other habits of expense very much since 
I fell into the habit of employing mine 
honest people. I wish you could have 
seen about a hundred children, being 
almost entirely supported by their fathers’ 
or brothers’ labor, come down yesterday 
to dance to the pipes, and get a piece of 
cake and bannock, and pence a-piece (no 
very deadly largess) in honor of hogmanay. 
I declare to you, my dear friend, that 
when I thought the poor fellows who kept 
these children so neat, and well taught, 
and well behaved, were slaving the whole 
day for eighteen-pence or twenty-pence 
at the most, I was ashamed of their grati- 
tude, and of their becks and bows. But 
after all, one does what one can, and it is 
better twenty families should be com- 
fortable according to their wishes and 
habits, than half that number should be 
raised above their situation. Besides, like 
Fortunio in the fairy tale, I have my 
gifted men—the best wrestler and cudgel- 
player—the best runner and leaper— 
the best shot in the little district; and, as 
I am partial to all manly and athletic 
exercises, these are great favorites, being 
otherwise decent persons, and bearing 
their faculties meekly. All this smells of 
sad egotism, but what can I write to you 
about save what is uppermost in my own 
thoughts? And here am I, thinning old 
plantations and planting new ones; now 
undoing what has been done, and now 
doing what I suppose no one would do 
but myself, and accomplishing all my 
magical transformations by the arms and 
legs of the aforesaid genii, conjured up to 
my aid at eighteen-pence a day.

Never did I see a brighter day at 
Abbotsford than that on which Miss 
Edgeworth first arrived there—never 
can I forget her look and accent when 
she was received by him at his arch- 
way, and exclaimed, “Every thing 
about you is exactly what one ought 
to have had wit enough to dream!”

The weather was beautiful, and the 
edifice, and its appurtenances, were 
all but complete; and day after day, 
so long as she could remain, her host 
had always some new plan of gaiety. 
One day there was fishing on the 
Cauldshields’ Loch, and a dinner on 
the heathy bank. Another, the whole 
party feasted by Sir Thomas the 
Rhymer’s waterfall in the glen—and 
the stone on which Maria that. day 
sat was ever afterwards called ““Edge- 
worth’s Stone.” A third day we had 
to go farther afield. He must needs 
show her, not Newark only, but all 
the upper scenery of the Yarrow, and 
the baskets were unpacked about sun- 
set, beside the ruined Chapel over- 
looking St. Mary’s Loch. He had 
scrambled to gather bluebells and 
heath-flowers, with which all the young 
ladies must twine their hair—and they 
sang, and he recited, until it was time 
to go home beneath the softest of 
harvest moons. Thus a fortnight was 
passed—and the vision closed; for Miss 
Edgeworth never saw Abbotsford 
again during his life. 
A point of hospitality in which Sir 
Walter Scott never failed, whatever 
might be the pretensions of the guest, 
was to do the honors of conversation. 
When a stranger arrived, he seemed 
to consider it as much a duty to offer 
him the resources of his mind as those 
of his table; taking care, however, by 
his choice of subjects, to give the 
visitor an opportunity of making his 
own stores, if he had them, available. 
It would be extremely difficult to 
give a just idea of his general conversa- 
tion to anyone who had not known 
him. Considering his great personal 
and literary popularity, and the wide 
circle of society in- which he had lived, 
it is perhaps remarkable that so few 
of his sayings, real or imputed, are in 
circulation, But the great charm of 
his table talk was in the sweetness LEGEND AND HISTORY 
and abandon with which it flowed— » 
always, however, guided by good sense 
and taste; the warm and unstudied 
eloquence with which he expressed 
rather sentiments than opinions; and 
the liveliness and force with which he 
narrated and described; and all that 
he spoke derived so much of its effect 
from indefinable felicities of manner, 
look, and tone—and sometimes from 
the choice of apparently insignificant 0 
words—that a moderately faithful 
transcript of his sentences would be 
but a faint image of his conversation. 
No one who has seen him can forget 
the surprising power of change which 
his countenance showed when awak- 
ened from a state of composure. 
Never, perhaps, did a man go through 
all the gradations of laughter with 
such complete enjoyment, and a coun- 70 
tenance so radiant. The first dawn . 
of a humorous thought would show 
itself sometimes, as he sat silent, by 
an involuntary lengthening of the 
upper lip, followed by a shy sidelong 
glance at his neighbors, indescribably 
whimsical, and seeming to ask from 
their looks whether the spark of droll- 
ery should be suppressed or allowed 
to blaze out. In the full tide of mirth s 
he did indeed “laugh the heart’s 
laugh,” like Walpole, but it was not 
boisterous and overpowering, nor did 
it check the course of his words; he 
could go on telling or descanting, 
while his lungs did “crow like chanti- 
cleer,” his syllables, in the struggle, 
growing more emphatic, his accent 
more strongly Scotch, and his voice 
plaintive with excess of merriment.

LIFE OF SCOTT 
of Ballantyne—of which he was a partner 
—had failed. The following extract shows 
the noble spirit with which he faced this ‘sia } 
In the course of that unhappy yet 
industrious week, Sir Walter’s situa- 
tion as Ballantyne’s partner became 
universally known. Mr. Ballantyne, 
as an individual, had no choice but to 
esolve on the usual course of a com- 
aercial man unable to meet engage- 
aents; but Scott from the first moment 
letermined to avoid, if by his utmost 
fforts it could be avoided, the neces- 
ity of participating in such steps. He 
mmediately placed his whole affairs 
n the hands of three trustees, all men 
of the highest honor and of great pro- 
fessional experience; and declined 
every offer of private assistance. These 
were very numerous: his eldest son 
and his daughter-in-law eagerly ten- 
dered the whole fortune at their dis- 
x» posal, and the principal banks of Edin- 
burgh, especially the house of Sir 
William Forbes and Co., which was 
the one most deeply involved in Bal- 
lantyne’s obligations, sent partners of 
the first consideration, who were his 
personal friends, to offer liberal addi- 
tional accommodation. What, I think, 
affected him most of all, was a letter 
from Mr. Poole, his daughters’ harp- 
% master, offering £500—“‘probably,” 
says the Diary, “his all.” From Lon- 
don, also, he received various kind 
communications. Among others, one 
tendering an instant advance of £30,- 
000—a truly munificent message, con- 
veyed through a distinguished channel, 
but the source of which was never 
tevealed to him, nor to me until some 
years after his death, and even then 
under conditions of secrecy. To all, 
| hisanswer wasthesame. And withina 
few days he had reason to believe that 
the creditors would, as a body, assent 
to let things go in the course which he 
and his trustees suggested. 377 
His Diary has this entry for the 24th 
January: “TI went to the Court for the 
first time today, and like the man with 
the large nose, thought everybody was 
thinking of me and my mishaps. Many 
were, undoubtedly, and all rather re- 
grettingly; some obviously affected. - 
It is singular to see the difference of 
men’s manner whilst they strive to be 
kind or civil in their way of addressing 
me. Some smiled as they wished me 
good-day, as if to say, “Think nothing 
about it, my lad; it is quite out of our 
thoughts.’ Others greeted me with the 
affected gravity which one sees and 
despises at a funeral. The best-bred— 
all I believe meaning equally well— 
just shook hands and went on. A 
foolish puff in the papers, calling on 
men and gods to assist a popular 
author, who having choused the public 
of many thousands, kad not the sense 
to keep wealth when he hadit. IfI am 
hard pressed and measures used 
against me, I must use all means of 
legal defense, ‘and subscribe myself 
bankrupt. It is the course one should, 
at any rate, have advised a client to - 
take. But for this I would, in a Court 
of Honor, deserve to lose my spurs. 
No—if they permit me, I will be their 
vassal for life, and dig in the mine of 
my imagination to find diamonds—or 
what may sell for such—to make good 
my engagements, not to enrich myself. 
And this from no reluctance to be 
called the Insolvent, which I probably 
am, but because I will not put out of 
the power of my creditors the re- 
sources, mental or literary, which yet 
remain to me.” 
The day of calamity revealed the 
fact that James Ballantyne personally 
possessed no assets whatever. The 
claims against Sir Walter, as the sole 
really responsible partner in the print- 
ing firm, and also as an individual, 
settled into a sum of about £130,000. 
On much heavier debts Constable 
 
-P-A-G-E-387

and Co. paid ultimately 2s. 9d. in the 
pound; Hurst and Robinson about 
ls. 83d. The Ballantyne firm had as 
yet done nothing to prevent their 
following the same line of conduct. It 
might still have allowed itself (and 
not James Ballantyne merely as an 
individual) to be declared bankrupt, 
and obtained a speedy discharge, like 
these booksellers, from all its obliga- 
tions. But for Scott’s being a partner, 
the whole affair must have been settled 
in a very short time. Tf he could have 
at.all made up his mind to let com- 
mercial matters take the usual com- 
mercial course, the creditors of the 
firm would have brought into the 
market whatever property, literary or 
otherwise, Scott at the hour of failure 
possessed. All this being disposed of, 
the result would have been a dividend 
very far superioy to what the creditors 
of Constable and Hurst received; and 
in return, the partners in the printing 
firm would have been left at liberty to 
reap for themselves: the profits of 
their future exertions. 
Scott persisted in regarding the 
embarrassment of his commercial firm 
with the feelings not of a mercliant 
but of a gentleman. He thought that, 
by devoting the rest of his life to the 
service of his creditors, he .could, in 
the upshot, pay the last farthing he 
owed them. They, with one or two 
exceptions, applauded his honorable 
intentions and resolutions, and par- 
took, to a certain extent, in the self- 
reliance of their debtor. Nor had 
they miscalculated as to their interest. 
Nor had Sir Walter calculated wrong- 
ly. He paid the penalty of health and 
life, but he saved his honor and his 
self-respect. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notss 
1. These selections from -Lockhart’s Life of 
Scott are given, first, because they supply sev- LEGEND AND HISTORY 
eral intimate pictures of the home life and 
methods of work of the great poet, and second, 
because they will introduce you to biography 
as a form of literature. John Gibson Lockhart 
had already made a name for himself as a 
writer and editor when he met Scott in 1818, 
Two years later he married Sophia, Scott's 
eldest daughter, and spent his summers in a 
cottage near Abbotsford at a time when Scott 
was at the height of his powers. Though he 
afterwards became a distinguished editor and 
critic, it is by his work in biography that he is 
best remembered. His Life of Burns, pub- 
lished in 1898, still remains the most delightful 
introduction to the life and works of the poet. 
In 1837-1838 the Life of Scott appeared, and, 
like its predecessor, had a large sale. It is 
interesting to note that Lockhart assigned 
the profits from the book to Scott’s creditors, 
thus helping, after the death of the hero, to 
coraplete the payment of the debt. 
2. Biography is a form of history. It is the 
history of the life of a great man, and, like 
history itself, may bring in material from all 
sources in order to set forth clearly the age or 
period with which it deals. It is also like 
history in that it is a story. A good biography 
presents the story of a great ma © " * ‘ 
a way as to give us an intimal. 
with him, with his friends, witl 
in which he bore a part, and, in: 
the period in which he lived. 
8. There are many great biogr 
English. One of the first of these 
already learned about, Sir Thomas

Plutarch’s Lives, a series of biograr**-- ~ 
Greek and Roman heroes. North m.

LIFE OF SCOTT 
literature possesses many others scarcely less 
interesting, among them Lockhart’s Burns, 
Southey’s Nelson, and Irving’s Goldsmith. 
4. Closely related to the biography are col- 
lections of letters, and autobiographies. In 
the biography we get a picture of a man as 
seen by someone who has lived “with him, or 
has studied him so closely as to be able to 
produce the effect of intimacy. In the auto- 
biography and in the letters of great men we 
have self-revelation. All these, biography, 
autobiography, letters, are fascinating because 
of the stories they tell; they are also useful 
because a boy or girl who wishes to make the

SHAKESPEARE’S “JULIUS CAESAR” “AN INTRODUCTION 
I 
Tue AvuTHor oF THE Drama 
The man who wrote Julius Caesar was 
only thirty-six years old at the time, yet 
he was already one of the leading actors 
and playwrights of London. He was not, 
however, London born. He was in one 
sense a country boy, for he was born in a 
town of some two thousand inhabitants 
about eighty miles from London. 
‘When he was born, probably on April 
28, 1564, his father was a prosperous 
butcher and dealer in farm products, who 
later was made bailiff, or mayor, of the 
town. ‘There was in Stratford-on-Avon a 
free grammar school in which the mayor’s 
eldest son must have studied Latin gram- 
mar and Latin authors like Zsop, Ovid, 
and Virgil. He had to attend church every 
Sunday, as the town authorities were very 
strict about such matters. But he ap- 
parently had a great deal of time for 
amusement. He probably learned to 
bowl and to use the bow and arrow, because 
there were grounds for such sports in 
Stratford, It is very likely he watched a 
good many cock-fights and he learned 
about hunting with dogs and horses and 
also with falcons, though falcons were 
kept only by the wealthy men called 
“gentlemen.” He may have begun to act 
in his boyhood, for nearly every town had 
companies made up of the citizens. To 
act was with them a diversion, not a 
profession. He would also be interested 
in the companies that came from a large 
neighboring town, Coventry. His father, 
when he was bailiff, gave such a company 
permission to act. All in all, young 
Shakespeare must have had a good time 
as a boy. 
When he was only eighteen, he married 
Anne Hathaway. They had three children 
before he was twenty-two. Then he went 
away to London to try his fortune in the great city. He went at a time when 
opportunities were opening on every hand. 
The men engaged in trading with the 
Netherlands or in other business were 
growing rich very fast. The common 
people also had more comfort than they 
had ever enjoyed before. It was probably 
the theaters that. drew Shakespeare. 
London was still shut in by a wall some 
two miles around, and no theaters were 
allowed inside the wall. In the fields north 
of the wall and across the Thames to the 
south, however, were several theaters 
which were crowded daily, and even on 
Sundays, until the Puritans had a law 
passed against’ Sunday playing. It was 
the period of greatest dramatic activity 
in all of English history. 
Strolling players roamed over England, 
theatrical companies were formed, and 
theaters were built. One of these, The 
Globe, a summer theater, was made espe- 
cially famous by Shakespeare and his asso- 
ciates. The summer theaters were for day- 
light performances in the open air, with 
perhaps a roof over the stage or over the 
boxes and the galleries around the pit. 
Spectators were allowed to sit on the stage 
and mingle with the actors. The female 
characters in a play were taken by boys. 
There was only the rudest scenery, or none 
at all—a change of scene being indicated 
by printed signs. Because of this lack of 
scenery, actors were compelled to rely for 
their effects upon the lines and the acting. 
This is one of the reasons why the plays of 
Shakespeare have been read and played, 
studied and discussed, more than the works 
of any other writer. 
According to tradition, Shakespeare 
began his theatrical career in London by 
holding ‘the horses of the theater goers. 
Within six years he had become a play- 
wright himself. Before he was thirty he 
had become an important member of the 
leading theatrical company. His activi-

ties brought him not only honor but 
profit, for at thirty-three he bought the 
largest house in Stratford. In fact, when 
his friends in Stratford needed financial 
aid, they seem to have turned to him for 
assistance. 
Before he composed Julius Caesar he 
had written some twenty other plays. 
Some of them are very famous, as Romeo 
and Juliet, Midsummer Night’s Dream, 
The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, 
and Twelfth Night. These plays are the 
most interesting and brilliant of all 
Shakespeare’s comedies. If you have not 
read them, you will wish to before you 
are very much older. 
Julius Caesar is quite different. It is a 
tragedy. Shakespeare gained nearly all 
of his material for this play from Plutarch, 
a Greek who was born shortly before 
Caesar’s assassination. Plutarch lectured 
in Rome on philosophy and wrote a 
book containing fifty parallel lives of 
famous Greeks and Romans; as, Alexander 
and Caesar, Dion and Brutus, Demetrius 
and Antony. Shakespeare used Sir Thomas      
     
          
    
       North’s English translation, which he 
followed very closely in places. In this 
play he drew upon three of the “lives’’: 
“Caesar,” “Brutus,” and “Antony.” We 
cannot be sure of the exact time when the 
play was produced, but probably the 
public first saw it in the fall of 1800 T+ 
was so very successful that a riv: 
tried to bring out another play a1 
subject, to be called “Caesar’s rau. 
Beginning with Julius Caesar Shakes 
peare turned to tragedy. In ray 
cession he produced Hamlet, Othei. 
Lear, and Macbeth. Some of thes 
dies you will study before you a 
uated from high school, but all of t] 
will want to read before many years hav. 
passed. Later came Antony and Cleo 
patra, and Coriolanus, two Roman play 
which some students will find very inter 
esting to read in connection with Julé 
Caesar. When you have read all these yor 
will have become acquainted with th 
greatest dramas in English literature. 
Shortly after the death of Queen Eliz.

given up acting, but he kept his share in 
the Globe Theater, where his plays were 
produced. After 1611, when The Win- 
‘ter’s Tale and The Tempest were played, 
he lived most of the time in Stratford, 
though he occasionally helped to write 
plays for the London stage. Apparently 
too, he had a share in a business which 
provided heraldic devices for shields. He 
was a very genial. companion, not only 
with citizens of Stratford but also with 
those of neighboring towns. He died in 
1616, on April 23, according to tradition 
on the same day as his birth just fifty- 
three years before. He was buried in the 
chancel of the Stratford church. On the 
slab covering the spot are cut the lines: 
Good friend, for Jesus’ sake forbeare 
To dig the dust enclosed heare; 
Bleste be the man that spares these stones, 
And curst be he that moves my bones. 
It is said that Shakespeare composed 
these lines himself to keep later sextons 
from opening the grave for some other 
occupant. : 
I 
Roman Lire iv Cazsar’s Time 
How much do you know about Julius 
Caesar? Do you know enough to under- 
stand and enjoy Shakespeare’s great play 
on one of the greatest men in history? 
All that is necessary is to step for a few 
minutes back into the time of Caesar. 
For this purpose let us follow the career 
of Lucius Sergius Marcus. His name is 
so obscure that it is nowhere recorded in 
history, but his life will show how the 
days passed with a Roman citizen of 
humble rank in the century of the famous 
emperor, ° 
Marcus was born in the country several 
miles northeast of Rome in B. c. 80. His 
father’s little farm was surrounded by 
large estates, for the “patrician” (high- 
born) families in Rome had acquired vast 
wealth and had bought most of the land 
in the region. One of his earliest-recol- 
lections was that of watching, on. the hills 
to the north, a thousand slaves who :had 
been captured in war in many parts of the CAESAR 383 
world but who were now working in the 
fields and on the roadways of a single 
landholder. His chief playmate was the 
son of one of the overseers who directed 
the labor of these slaves. The farmers 
who in his father’s boyhood had lived in 
that region and cultivated the soil had 
entered the army or drifted off to Rome, 
the famous city'on the Tiber. 
While Marcus was still in his cradle, a 
celebrated. Roman general, Sulla, returned 
with his victorious, legions from Asia 
Minor and fought a fierce civil war at 
home. To understand why the Romans 
should join in civil conflict we must go 
back more than four centuries. At that 
time the Romans, under the leadership 
of Lucius Junius Brutus, banished the 
last king from the city. The royal powers 
were given to two consuls, who were 
elected by an assembly of the people 
and who held office for a year only. There 
was also a senate, made up of life members 
chiefly from among the patricians who 
had held office. It exercised ‘a strong 
influence, because the advice of the 
senators represented all the political 
experience of Rome. The consuls nearly 
always followed their wishes. 
In the lifetime of Marcus’s father the 
senate had grown so overbearing that 
the common people, or plebeians, became 
restless. While Sulla was fighting in 
Asia Minor, they overthrew the senate 
and ruled Rome through one of the consuls. 
But on Sulla’s return the democratic 
forces were soon crushed, and the senate 
was made more powerful than ever. The 
people could pass no law without the sen- 
ate’s consent, and only senators could 
serve as jurors in the courts. A general 
and a victorious army had settled for the 
time being the quarrel between patrician 
and plebeian. This'was a perilous turn 
of affairs, for a republic that is at the 
mercy of its own armies cannot long 
- survive. 
Marcus’s father kept his farm by sacri- 
fice and toil. In time he had to borrow 
money of a neighboring landholder. He 
got deeper into debt the older he grew. 
His. difficulties were increased when Mar- 
cus, his only living son, was drafted for the 
army and sent into northern Italy. There
-P-A-G-E-393
384 
the young man lost all trace of his father, 
since there was no way for poor people to 
correspond even if they could write. 
Marcus was very much surprised by the 
army. As a country boy, he had heard 
so much of military exploits that he had 
pictured the officers as very stern and the 
discipline as very severe. But his captain, 
or centurion, spent most of his time in 
  LEGEND AND HISTORY 
in the office. The people called that year 
the consulship of Julius and of Caesar. 
Marcus learned further that, instead 
of the senate, the real rulers of Rome 
were now three men: Crassus, who was 
the richest man in Rome, Pompey, whom 
some soldiers called the greatest general 
that ever lived, and Caesar. These men 
had agreed that Caesar should be governor 
  MAP AS A BACKGROUND TO “JULIUS CAESAR” 
gambling, and the soldiers idled away a 
good part of the day. In March of B. c. 
58 a new leader came to take charge. 
It was Julius Caesar. He made a very 
pleasing impression. From the gossip of 
the camp Marcus learned that Caesar, 
although a patrician, had always been on 
the side of the common people. The 
year before, he had held the highest office 
in Rome and had passed many good laws. 
There were always two consuls, as we have 
seen, but Caesar’s colleague, Bibulus, had 
been of the senatorial party and had tried 
to block his legislation. Caesar was a 
man who knew how to overcome opposi- 
tion, so that Bibulus was forced to stay 
at home, leaving Caesar practically alone of Gaul for five years. Part of Gaul was 
north of the Po River, but most of it was 
the region now known as France, though at 
this time Rome controlled only a strip along 
the Mediterranean: Hardly had Caesar 
arrived in northern Italy when he had to 
send the tenth legion of his army across 
the Alps to resist an invasion. Marcus 
was struck with amazement at the rapidity 
of the campaign which turned the Swiss 
tribe back into the Alps. The same sum- 
mer Caesar defeated a German tribe and 
forced it to recross the Rhine. Marcus 
was astonished to find that before going 
into battle some of the officers broke down 
and wept, that others made their wills, and 
that several asked for furloughs to go
-P-A-G-E-394
JULIUS 
home. The spirit of these patrician 
officers was so cowardly that in the chief 
battle Caesar dismounted from his horse 
and himself led a wavering attack. Mar- 
cus kept just ahead of him and, when the 
enemy were reached, at one time saved 
Caesar’s life by stopping a German 
javelin with his own shield. For this 
heroism Caesar made him.a member of 
his personal bodyguard. The effect of 
this victory was lasting. Even the tenth 
legion, a veteran troop, believed that 
Caesar was the greatest general who had 
ever commanded them. 
One of the most memorable scenes that 
Marcus witnessed was in B. c. 55 at 
Lucca, in northern Italy. Caesar there 
entertained Pompey, the famous general, 
and Crassus, the man of fabulous wealth. 
They were the three who had agreed in 
B. c. 60 to support each other. Now 
Caesar entertained them with a lavish 
magnificence that revealed how great a 
fortune he had acquired from the con- 
quered provinces in Gaul. In a few days 
the three agreed that Caesar should retain 
his governorship of Gaul for another five 
years, that Pompey should similarly 
govern Spain, and that Crassus should 
rule the Roman provinces in the East. 
It was also decided that Pompey and 
Crassus should be consuls in B. c. 55. 
. It may seem strange that all this could 
be settled so far from Rome, since the 
consuls were elected by the people in one 
of their assemblies. But Caesar’s newly 
acquired wealth and the votes of his 
veterans would enable him to carry any 
such election as he wished. The people 
were not ‘very faithful about voting, and 
those who did vote could be bought up 
. with little difficulty. 
Marcus believed that Caesar had struck 
terror into the Gauls and the Germans, 
but no sooner was the conference at Lucca 
concluded than the great commander 
had to hurry back to Gaul. For nearly 
five years more he had to quell treacherous 
revolts that taxed his military genius to 
the utmost. Marcus’s admiration was 
mingled with a constant fear that Caesar’s 
tashness in battle would end fatally. 
But the boldness and speed of his opera- 
tions brought peace in the end. By B. c. CAESAR 385 
50 he had subdued Gaul so thoroughly 
that traders circulated throughout the 
province, and immense sums in taxes and 
in grain and cattle flowed into Caesar’s 
coffers and the Roman treasury. Besides, 
many Gauls entered his legions. 
At the close of ten years of constant 
travel and combat in Gaul, Marcus ‘re- 
turned peacefully to northern Italy. He 
rather expected Caesar to retire to private 
life, as most other Roman conquerors 
had. done, for a time at least. But 
Caesar felt that this would be perilous, 
for Pompey, no longer a friend, had 
recently sided with the senate. This 
meant that if Caesar became a private 
citizen, his enemies among the patricians 
might have him tried and secure his 
banishment or even his death. These 
fears were not unfounded, for the Senate 
soon ordered him to lay down his command 
at once or be considered a public enemy. 
Caesar had been alert to the possible 
peril and had had two of his friends elected 
tribunes. . Originally tribunes had been 
plebeians, and their duty had been to 
protect the common people against any 
abuse by the patricians. Their persons 
were sacred even against the consuls, and 
they had the right to veto any law. Later 
the patricians, in order to secure these 
two privileges for their party, had been 
made eligible to hold this office. It 
happened at this time, that one of the 
two tribunes was especially friendly to 
Caesar, being his own nephew, Mark 
Antony. When the senate decreed Caesar 
an enemy, both of the tribunes vetoed the 
decree. They were roughly treated and 
for safety fled to Caesar’s camp. 
Marcus long remembered the evening. 
on which as guard he stood outside the 
door and heard Mark Antony recount to 
Caesar the events in the capital during 
the last few days. The province they 
were in was separated from Roman terri- 
tory proper by a little stream, the Rubicon. 
The next night Caesar, with a single 
legion, came to the banks and paused. 
It is said that with the exclamation, “The 
die is cast!” he crossed the Rubicon and 
summoned his troops to follow him. By 
invading Roman soil. he hecame an enemy 
of the republic. Caesar felt that when the A 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
386 
patricians showed themselves bent upon 
oppressing the common people, they 
proved themselves unfit to rule the Roman 
world. He quickly made himself master 
of Italy, but Pompey and most of the 
senatorial party escaped to Greece. Many 
of Pompey’s troops were in Spain, but 
Caesar instantly made up his mind what 
to do. Marcus heard him say, “I am 
" going to Spain to fight an army without 
a general, and thence to the East to fight 
a general without an army.” 
Marcus had always reverenced the way 
the old Romans had ordered the govern- 
ment; he thought nothing ought to be 
changed. Only his great love for Caesar 
and hatred for his enemies caused him to 
approve of Caesar’s appointing his own 
representatives to rule Rome in his 
absence. His devotion was put to a test 
when Caesar ordered him to remove a 
tribune from the door of the treasury and 
take all the money in it. But after 
Caesar’s victorious campaign against the 
Pompeian faction in Spain, he was over- 
joyed to see his beloved commander 
elected “dictator” by the popular assembly. 
He recalled the old stories of the time 
when the kings were driven from Rome. 
Provision had been made then for emer- 
gencies when the public safety demanded 
a single ruler. This ruler was called a 
dictator and was given unlimited powers. 
By this office, Caesar was empowered to 
preside at elections, in which he was 
elected consul. He was able to lay down 
his dictatorship in eleven days. 
In z. c. 48 Caesar at last met Pompey 
at Pharsalus in Thessaly. His army was 
much smaller than Pompey’s, but. it 
consisted of veteran troops whom he had 
trained in Gaul. The officers were no 
longer the cowardly idlers he found when 
he took charge. They were now so 
devoted to their leader that they would 
follow him anywhere. They overwhelmed 
the enemy so completely that Pompey fled. 
In pursuit of Pompey, Caesar next went 
to Alexandria in Egypt, where the head of 
his rival was brought to him by a would-be 
friend. After settling matters in Egypt, 
he passed into Asia and overthrew his 
enemies there by a single battle. When he 
returned unexpectedly to Rome, he made 
  LEGEND AND HISTORY 
use of the powers of dictator, which had 
again been granted him, to raise-money, 
pass some important bills, and appoint the 
necessary judges and other officera,-" In 
three months he was ready to attack:the 
last stronghold of the senatorial pacty- in 
Northern Africa. 
At the battle of Thapsus, that followed,   
. Marcus was horrified to see the soldiers 
break from Caesar’s control and slaughter 
the enemy without mercy. Many: ofthe 
refugees fled to Utica, on the coast hear 
the site of Carthage. There Cato,the 
most respected of the opponents:~<of 
Caesar, saw that it was no longer possible 
to stand against the great general, “and, 
rather than live under the conqueror, 
committed suivide. 
The proudest moment of Marcus's: ‘life 
was during the triumph that followed 
Caesar’s return to Rome. The procession 
of chariots that rolled along the Sacred 
Way, the lavish display of spoils from 
Gaul, from the East, from Africa,- fairly 
dazzled the Roman populace that: lined 
the street and shouted itself hoarse with 
enthusiasm. ‘ Caesar was made dictator 
for the third time and ‘began to reform the 
government. His labors were interrupted 
by an uprising in Spain led by the eldest 
son of Pompey. When Caesar led his 
army into Spain ‘he was obliged to fight 
with great ferocity to quell the revolt. 
Indeed, he declared in Marcus’s presence 
that he had often before fought for victory 
but never until now for life. The slaughter 
on the field of battle exceeded that at 
Thapsus, and afterwards the son of 
Pompey was hunted down and put to 
death. Thus in March 3. c. 45 Caesar 
was at last undisputed military master of 
the Roman world. 
Marcus took part in another triumph, 
and all the Romans vied with each other 
to honor Caesar. He had already been 
made “Imperator,”’ or emperor, for life, 
a title that gave him command anywhere in 
Roman dominions. He was now made 
dictator for life. He coined money show- 
ing the image of his head, and his statue 
was added to those of the seven kings in 
early Roman history that stood in the 
Capitol. In public he wore the purple 
dress that formerly was worn only in tri-

  —— 
TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION OF CAESAR 
umphs. It became so important to be near 
him that rents rose in the section of the 
city where he lived. As one of his body- 
guard, Marcus saw members of some of the 
oldest and wealthiest patrician families 
waiting for hours in an ante-chamber for a 
personal interview. . 
Yet to Marcus, in most ways the govern- 
ment seemed hardly changed from that of 
his father’s time. The senate still mét, 
though it no longer had any control of 
finances, for Caesar kept that branch of 
government under his personal control. 
Yet it still discussed public measures and 
gave advice. To be sure, many senators 
had perished in Pompey’s armies, and 
Caesar had filled their places and had 
added three hundred others, so that the 
total was now nine hundred. These new 
men were usually supporters of Caesar, 
but he tried to bring all parties into the 
government. Some of the senators were 
even Gauls who could hardly understand 
the Latin language. This caused a good 
deal of grumbling among the patricians, but 
Marcus hadn’t very much sympathy with 
them. He felt that the senate had shown in the days of Sulla that it was not fit to 
govern the Roman world. It had grown 
too selfish and grasping. Marcus therefore 
thoughtit was all forthe best that the senate 
was forced to give way to the plans of 
Caesar. 
The common people still met in their 
assembly to pass laws and elect the 
various officers. At first it seemed to 
Marcus quite natural that the people 
should enthusiastically support Caesar, 
since for thirty years he had supported 
the popular party against the senate. 
But after a while Marcus began to see 
that the tribunes represented Caesar 
more than they did the people. The 
voters seemed to care very little about 
voting. Most of them, like Marcus 
himself, had been born in the country 
districts and had wandered to the city 
because men of wealth had bought up the 
land. Others were disbanded soldiers 
who had no means of livelihood. The 
only reason they could stay was that the 
government gave them almost enough 
wheat and barley to support them. It | 
was, therefore, very easy for wealthy
-P-A-G-E-397
388 
office ‘seekers to win enough votes to 
secure an election by providing games and 
gladiatorial combats. 
Caesar saw the danger in such a situa- 
tion. He cut down to 150,000, less than 
half of the previous number, the total of © 
- those who could receive free wheat. He 
likewise settled his soldiers either in 
colonies in ‘the provinces or on land in 
Italy. Besides, he tried to keep the 
governors and other officers of the pro- 
vinces from plundering the people there 
and filling their own pockets with the loot. 
The senate, or at least some of the 
senators, as Marcus knew, wanted to have 
the title of king conferred on Caesar. 
Caesar was quite unwilling, for he knew 
how bitterly the people hated the memory 
of the ‘old kings of Rome. He wished 
to preserve most of the forms that had 
grown up in the four centuries of the 
Roman republic. For the year 3. c. 
44 he was elected consul along with Mark 
Antony, a man who had faithfully sup- 
ported him ever since his return from 
Gaul. Marcus was so thoroughly devoted 
to Caesar that he wished the mighty Julius 
would continue forever. But the Im- 
perator, as he preferred to be called, now 
felt himself so well established in power 
that he no longer needed the protection 
of a bodyguard. He therefore provided 
land for each of his guards. To Marcus 
he gave a farm in the new province beyond 
the Po. His’ faithful follower was very 
reluctant to leave Caesar, but the great 
general told him that all the guard would 
be better off working for themselves on 
property of their own than in idling about 
the city and waiting for the government’s 
dole of wheat or barley. 
On his way from Rome, Marcus visited 
the region which he had left upon entering 
the army some fifteen years before. No 
trace of his father or his father’s farm was LEGEND AND HISTORY 
left. The land had been absorbed by one 
of the neighboring estates. By. diligent 
inquiry he found the son of’ the dyerseer, 
whom he had known in his‘ ayhood. 
The man was now himself an overseer and 
a strong supporter of the patricians. He 
told of the sale of the farm to satisfy the 
debt against it shortly after. Marcus’s 
departure and of the old man’s dying in 
Rome with some relatives. .. 
He and Marcus got into “heated 
argument that arose from a remark’ which 
Marcus let drop, about Caesar’: _ Bodlike 
powers. 
You are as sacrilegious as the ‘sourviest 
plebeian!” cried the overseer, “Why 
should Caesar’s image be. carried among 
those of the immortal gods! ‘It ‘is un- 
pardonable that any Roman should accept 
divine honors from Romani citizens.” 
“But you will admit that he rules the 
country like a god!’’. answered Marcus. 
“Not for a moment!” said the angry 
overseer. “Caesar is ruining the country. 
There is no future ahead of a man today. 
In the old times he could get some office 
in a province and come back in a few 
years a rich man. Now he can hardly 
get enough to make it worth while. No, 
we've had enough of this one-man rule! 
‘Times were much better when the senate 
ruled Rome!”’ 
“But were the poor people better off?” 
asked Marcus. 
“Oh, the rabble!” exclaimed the other. 
“What rights have they?” 
With this dispute fresh in his mind, 
Marcus proceeded on his way to his farm. 
But hardly had he reached his new home 
when the frightful news came that the 
kind master of fifteen years, the victorious 
general, and the wise ruler, had been assas- 
sinated by a band of his political enemies. 
And Marcus knew that the civilized world 
would again be thrown into confusion.

You, sir, what trade are you? 
See. Com. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine 
workman, I am but, as you would say, a 
cobbler. 12 
Mar. But what trade art thou? Answer 
me directly. 
See. Com. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I 
may use with a safe conscience; which is, 
indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles. 
Mar. What trade, thou knave? thou 
naughty knave, what trade? 
Sec. Com. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not 
out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I 
ean mend you. 20 
Mar, What mean’st thou by that? mend 
me, thou saucy fellow! 
Sec. Com. Why, sir, cobble you. 
Flav. Thou art.a cobbler, art thou? 
See. Com. Truly, sir, all that I live by is 
with the awl; I meddle with no tradesman’s 
matters, nor women’s matters, but with 
awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to old 
ghoes; when they are in great danger, I 
recover them. As proper men as ever 
trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon 
my handiwork. 32 
Flav. But wherefore art not in thy shop 
today? 
Why dost thou lead these men about the 
streets?

shoes, to get myself into more work. But,

Quxstions anv Topics 
1. Judging from this scene alone, what 
conflict do you think the play is going to develop? 
Will the play be tragic or comic? 
%. Are your sympathies with the tribunes 
or with the common people? Why? 
8. Do you think the speech of Marullus 
beginning ‘‘Wherefore rejoice?” is poetical or 
eloquent? Select particular lines that bear out 
your opinion. 
4. Punning is a favorite source of humor 
throughout Shakespeare’s plays. Point out 
examples in the cobbler’s speeches, lines 14-32, 
Class Reading or Acting. The tribunes’ 
rebuke of the commoners (lines 1-82). 
Scene II. A public place. 
Flourish, Enter Caesar; Antony, for the 
course; Calpurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, 
Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd 
following, among them a soothsayer. 
Caes, Calpurnia! 
Casca. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. 
Caes. Calpurnia! 
Cal. Here, my lord. 
Caes. Stand you directly in Antonius’ 
way, When he doth run his course. Antonius! 
Ant. Caesar, my lord? 5 
Caes. Forget not, in your speed, An- 
tonius, 
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say, 
The barren, touchéd in this holy chase, 
Shake off their sterile curse. 
Ant. I shall remember: 
When Caesar says “do this,” it is per- 
formed. 10

You bear too stubborn and too strange a

Bru. Cassius, 
Be not deceived; if I have veiled my look, 
I turn the trouble of my countenance 
Merely upon myself. WVexed I am 
Of late with passions of some difference, 40 
Conceptions only proper to myself, 
Which give some soil perhaps to my be-

Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, 
Forgets the shows of love to other men. 
Cas. Then, Brutus, I have much mis- 
took your passion; 
By means whereof this breast of mine 
hath buried 
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogita- 
tions. 50 
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your 
face? 
Bru. No, Cassius; for the eye sees not 
itself 
But by reflection, by some other things. 
Cas. ’Tis just; . 
And it is very much lamented, Brutus, 55 
That you have no such mirrors as will 
turn 
Your hidden worthiness into your eye, 
That you might see your shadow. I have 
heard 
Where many of the best respect in Rome, 
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of 
Brutus . 60 
And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, 
Have wished that noble Brutus had his 
eyes. 
Bru. Into what dangers would you lead 
me, Cassius, 
That you would have me seek into myself 
For that which is not in me? 65 
Cas. Therefore, good Brutus, be pre- 
pared to hear; 
And since you know you cannot see your- 
self 
So well as by. reflection, I, your glass, 
Will modestly discover to yourself 69 
That of yourself which you yet know not of. 
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. 
Were I a common laugher, or did use 
To stale with ordinary oaths my love 
To every new protester; if you know 74 
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard 
And after scandal them, or if you know 
That I profess myself in banqueting 
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

Choose Caesar for their king. 
Cas. Aye, do you fear it? » 
Then must I think you would not have it 
So. 
Bru. I would not,. Cassius; yet I love

But wherefore do you hold me here so long? 
What is it that you would impart to me? 
If it be aught toward the general good, 8 
Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other, 
And I will look on both indifferently, 
For let the gods so speed me as I love 
The name of honor more than I fear death. 
Cas. I know that virtue to be in you, 
Brutus, 90 5 
As well as I do know your outward favor. 
Well, honor is the subject of my story. 
I cannot tell what you and other men 
Think of this life; but, for my single self, 
T had as lief not be as live to be 85 
In awe of such a thing as I myself. 
I was born free as Caesar; so were you; 
We both have fed as well, and we can both 
Endure the winter’s cold as well as he; 
For once, upon a raw and gusty day, 10 
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, 
Caesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, 
now, 
Leap in with me into this angry flood, 
And swim to yonder point?” Upon the 
word, 
Accoutered as I was, I plungéd in 105 
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.

With lusty sinews, throwing it aside

caps and uttered such a deal of stinking 
breath because Caesar refused the crown 
that it had almost choked Caesar; for he 
swounded and fell down at it; and for 
mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear 
of opening my lips and receiving the bad 
air. . 259 
Cas. But, soft, I pray you; what, did 
Caesar swound? 
Casca, He fell down in the market- 
place, and foamed at the mouth, and was 
speechless. 
Bru. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling 
sickness. 
Cas. No, Caesar hath it not; but you 
and I : 265 
And honest Casca, we have the falling 
sickness. . 
Casca. I know not what you mean by 
that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. Ié 
the tag-rag people did not clap him and 
hiss him, according as he pleased and dis- 
pleased them, as they use to do the players 
in the theater, I am no true man. 
Bru. What said he when he came unto 
himself? . 873, 
Casca. Marry, before he fell down, when 
he perceived the common herd was glad 
he refused the crown, he plucked me ope 
his doublet and offered them his throat 
to cut. An I had been a man of any 
occupation, if I would not have taken him 
at a word, I would I might go to hell 
among the rogues. And so he fell. When 
he came to himself again, he said if he 
had done or said anything amiss, he de- 
sired their worships to think it was his 
infirmity. Three or four wenches, where 
I stood, cried, “Alas, good soul!’ and for- 
gave him with all their hearts. But there’s 
no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar 
had stabbed their mothers, they would+ 
have done no less. 290

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Nores 
1, There would be no intermission between 
this scene and the preceding. As soon as 
Flavius and Marullus had left the stage at 
one side, Caesar and his party would enter at 
the other and go to the front of the stage. 
2. This scene exhibits more specifically the 
conflict suggested in scene i. We see the power 
of Caesar recognized in the attempt to crown 
him king. We see the beginnings of the con- 
spiracy against him and are made to feel that 
Brutus will be induced to head it. 
8. The scene also introduces all the chief 
characters and gives the key to their natures. 
Brutus is a contemplative man, who is always 
testing life by his ideals, but who holds some- 
what aloof from others and does not think of 
- doing anything about public conditions. Cas- 
sius, on the contrary, is an-alert, active man, 
strongly influenced by jealousy. Casca prides 
himself on his crude bluntness. Caesar has 
become so accustomed to rule that he takes for 
granted that his orders will be carried out, yet 
he apparently has a very keen sense of what 
will please the people. Though his ambition 
is strong, he governs his acts to secure popular 
approval. 
Quzstions AND Topics 
1, What is your first impression of Caesar? 
‘What physical weaknesses are brought to light 
during the scene? Is he superstitious? Is hea 
haughty, overbearing man? Has he warm 
friends? Is he a good judge of men? What 
is his attitude toward the people? From this 
scene would you think him one of the greatest 
figures in history? .

2, What is your first impression of Brutus? 
Why does he not follow the crowd? Does he 
trust the people? Why does he distrust 
Caesar? What is Cassius’s opinion of him?

If so, what will be his reasons?

And he shall wear his crown by sea and

In every place save here in Italy.

Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.

Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Nores 
Though there is no indication here to the 
audience, this scene takes place one month 
later than the preceding, on the night before 
March 15. We learn the further development 
of the conspiracy and are made to feel the 
portentous atmosphere that forbodes the death 
of Caesar. Casca again shows that his mood 
is controlled by circumstances. Cicero has all 
the calm of a philosopher. 
Questions AND Tortcs 
1. Is Casca’s superstition here in keeping 
with his ‘cynicism in scene ii? Why does he 
join the conspiracy? What is his opinion of 
Brutus? Why do Cassius and Casca desire 
Brutus to be among the conspirators? 
2. Is Cassius superstitious? What two 
examples of his alertness occur in this scene? 
How does his manner of winning Casca differ 
from his manner with Brutus? Is he sincere in 
his speech, “f know where I will wear”? What 
evidence have we of Cassius’s activity and lead- 
ership in the conspiracy? 
8. Doyou think the plans of the conspirators 
practical and well-arranged? 
4. Does the scene produce in you a sense of 
foreboding? Point out the details that give 
you your impression.

_And for Mark Antony, think not of him; 181 
For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm 
When Caesar’s head is off. 
Cas. Yet I fear him; 
For in the ingrafted love he bears to 
Caesar— 
Bru. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of 
him; 185 
If he love Caesar, all that he can do : 
Is to himself, take thought and die for 
Caesar; 
And that were much he should; for he is 
given * 
To sports, to wildness, and much company. 
Treb. There is no fear in him; let him 
not die; 190 
For he will live, and laugh at this here- 
after. [Clock strikes. 
Bru, Peace! count the clock. 
Cas. The clock hath stricken three. 
Treb. ’Tis time to part. 
Cas. But it is doubtful yet, 
Whether Caesar will come forth today, or 
no; 
For he is superstitious grown of late, 195 
Quite from the main opinion he held once 
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. 
It may be, these apparent prodigies, 
The unaccustomed terror of this night, 
And the persuasion of his augurers 
May hold him from the Capitol today. 
Dee. Never fear that; if he be so resolved, 
I can o’ersway him; for he loves to hear 
That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, 
And bears with glasses, elephants with 
holes, 205 
Lions with toils, and men with flatterers; 
But when I tell him he hates flatterers, 
He says he does, being then most flattered. 
Let me work; 
For I can give his humor the true bent, 
And I will bring him to the Capitol. 211

Bru. I am not well in health, and that is 
all.

health, 
He would embrace the means to come by it. 
Bru, Why, soI do. Good Portia, go to

ing of the conspirators. Here the humane 
character of Brutus is revealed. In the con- 
spiracy he is acting from motives of the highest 
patriotism, but because of his trust in men he 
renders decisions that bode ill for the outcome of 
the enterprise. The setting of the first scene 
was probably suggested by a bush or two set 
at the rear of the stage. 
Quzstions anp Topics 
1. Do you find any new traits in the char- 
acter of Brutus in this scene? Do his soliloquies 
add to your admiration for him? Take each 
soliloquy up separately and explain the reason 
for your answer. 
2. How forceful are Brutus’s reasons for 
sparing Antony? Is he or Cassius the better 
judge of character? What do thé other con- 
spirators think of Brutus’s judgment? Why 
have they formed this opinion? Is he the leader 
or the tool of the conspirators or is he some- 
times the one, sometimes the other? Give 
instances to prove your answer. 
3. In this scene what evidence do you find 
of Brutus’s patriotism? What motives prompt 
each of the other conspirators? 
4, Why is Lucius introduced into this scene? 
What would be lost if he were omitted? 
5. What do we learn of Brutus from his 
conversation with Portia? Why is she regarded 
as a noble Roman matron? 
6. What evidence do you find of the practical 
side of Cassius? Is he a good judge of character? 
Is he a man who can select the best way of 
reaching a desired end? Quote passages as 
evidence, 
7. How far is the story carried by this scene? 
Where do we first learn of Brutus’s decision to 
lead the conspiracy? What do Brutus and 
Cassius talk about in lines 101-111? How 
complete are the plans for the assassination? 
How do the conspirators guard against inform- 
ers? 
8. Exactly what is Brutus’s argument in 
lines 28-34? Do you think it a fair argument? 
That is, would it be safe to follow that kind of 
reasoning in life today? 
9. In the whole passage, is Brutus seeking to 
learn what it is wise to do, or is he trying to 
convince himself of the wisdom of a course of 
action he has already settled-upon? Do you 
like him better or less as a result of this 
speech? 
10. How should this passage be read, 
rapidly or deliberately? Why? 
Class Reading or Acting. Brutus muses 
over the conspiracy (lines 10-85); the con- 
spiracy is completed (lines 86-228); Brutus 
and Portia (lines 233-309),

Cal. What mean you, Caesar? Think 
you to walk forth? 
You shall not stir out of your house today. 
Caes. Caesar shall forth; the things that 
threatened me 10 
Ne’er looked but on my back; when they 
shall see 
The face of Caesar, they are vanishéd. 
Cal. Caesar, I never stood on ceremo- 
nies, 
Yet now they fright me. There is one 
within, 
Besides the things that we have heard and 
seen, 15 
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the 
watch. 
A lioness hath whelpéd in the streets; 
And graves have yawned, and yielded up 
their dead; 
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds, 
In ranks and squadrons and right form of 
war, 20 
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; 
The noise of battle hurtled in the air, 
Horses did neigh, and dying men did 
groan, 
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about 
the streets. 
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use, 
And I do fear them. 
Caes. What can be avoided — 26 
Stage direction. nightgown, dressing gown. 5. pre- 
sent, immediate. 6. success, result. 13. stood on ceremonies, believed in signs and omens. 25. use, cus- tom. 96-27, What can be, etc. Caesar is apparently a fatalist; that is, he thinks the gods make important events, such as death, inevitable. LEGEND AND HISTORY 
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? 
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these pre- 
, dictions 
Are to the world in general as to Caesar. 
Cal. When beggars die, there are no 
comets seen; 
The heavens themselves blaze forth the 
death of princes. 
Caes. Cowards. die many times before 
their deaths; 
The valiant never taste of death but once. 
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
Ii seems to me most strange that men 
should fear, 35 
Seeing that death, a necessary end, 
Will come when it will come. 
Re-enter servant. 
What say the augurers? 
Serv. They would not have you to stir 
forth today. 
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, 
They could not find a heart within the 
beast. 
Caes. The gods do this in shame of 
cowardice; 
Caesar should be a beast without a, heart 
If he should stay at home today for fear. 
No, Caesar shall not; danger knows full well 
That Caesar is more dangerous than he. 45 
We are two lions littered in one day, 
And I the elder and more terrible; 
And Caesar shall go forth. 
Cal. Alas, my lord, 
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. 
Do not go forth today; call it my fear 50 
That keeps you in the house, and not your 
own. 
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate- 
house; 
And he shall say you are not well today. 
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

well; Es) 
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home,

Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser.

far, 
To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth? 
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. 
Dee. Most mighty Caesar, let me know 
some cause, 
Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. 
Caes. The cause is in my will; I will not 
come; 7 
That is enough to satisfy the senate. 
But for your private satisfaction, 
Because I love you, I will let you know: 
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at 
home; 
She dreamt tonight she saw my statué, 76 
Which, like a fountain with an hundred 
spouts, 
Did run pure blood; and many lusty 
Romans 
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in . 
its. 
And these does she apply for warnings, and 
portents, 80 
And evils imminent; and on her knee 
Hath begged that I will stay at home today. 
Dec. This dream is all amiss interpreted; 
It was a vision fair and fortunate: 84 
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, - 
In which so many smiling Romans bathed, 
Signifies that from you great Rome shall 
suck 
Reviving blood, and that great men shall 
press 
For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. 
This by Calpurnia’s dream is signified. 90 
Caes, And this way have you well ex- 
pounded it. 
Dec. I have, when you have heard what 
Tecan say; 
And know it now: the senate have con- 
cluded 
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

come, 95

Persons, cognizance, badge. CAESAR 407 
_ Their minds may change. Besides, it were 
a mock : 
Apt to be rendered, for someone to say, 
“Break up the senate till another time, 
When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better 
dreams.” 
If Caesar hide himself, shall they. not 
whisper, : : 100 
“Lo, Caesar is afraid?” 
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear, dear love 
To your proceeding bids me tell you this; 
And reason to my love is liable.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
The setting for this scene would be indicated 
by drawing the curtains aside and revealing a. 
chair or two on the inner stage. The scene not 
only advances the plans of the conspirators 
‘rapidly, but in the dialogue between Calpurnia 
and Caesar, provides a fine contrast with the 
scene between Brutus and Portia. 
Questions AND Toprcs 
1. What incidents in this scene arouse our 
suspense? What do you look forward to when 
the scene closes? 
2. Do you think Caesar is disturbed by the 
portents? Is he afraid of death? Is it Cal- 
purnia or the augurs who keep him at home? 
Why is Decius successful in persuading him to 
go to the Senate? What opinion do you form 
of him from his reception of his callers? Is it 
consistent with your previous impressions? 
3. Why is Calpurnia alarmed? Why does 
she try to dissuade Caesar from going? How 
does her appeal differ from Portia’s appeal to 
Brutus? Why isshe-silent while Decius speaks? 
How do you suppose she looks when Caesar 
decides to go? 
Scunn IIL, A street near the Capitol. 
Enter Artemidorus, reading a paper. 
Art. Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed 
of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an 
eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark 
well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves 
thee not; thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. 
There is but one mind in ail these men, 
and it is bent against Caesar. If thou

How does this scene increase our antici-

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
After Ligarius left, Brutus told Portia fi 
his plans. Her fever of anxiety, now that the 
hour arrives, is here depicted. 
How does this scene further arouse our 
‘suspense? Why does Portia appear so much 
excited? Do you share her anxiety? What 
further chance, at the end of this act, appears 
to lie before Caesar? 
Act II ss a Wuois 
1. Continue the story of the play as you 
began it for Act I, including the summarizing 
sentence. What title would be appropriate for 
this act? 
2. Is your interest in coming events any more 
eager than it was at the close of Act I? What 
incidents and scenes have helped most to this 
result? . Have you a more definite expectation 
than at the close of Act I? 
8. What new characters are introduced, and 
why is each introduced? 
4, What incidents in this act arouse sym- 
pathy and admiration for Brutus? Do any 
incidents arouse similar feelings for Caesar? 
5. It has been Said that Brutus is a dreamer, 
that he dreams into other people’s minds the 
same high principles that govern his own 
conduct, and so mistakes the ideals of the 
Roman people. Prove or disprove this state- 
ment from the first two acts, 
6. Note carefully the arguments of Brutus 
(scene i, lines 10-34) for the assassination of 
Caesar. How would an American political 
leader endeavor to get rid of an opponent? 
7. Is there any evidence, in the discussions 
of the conspirators, of the power of the common 
people of Rome?

dorus and the soothsayer. Flourish. Enter

the street? 
Come to the Capitol. 
Caesar goes up to the senate-house, the rest 
following.

thrive. 
Cas. What enterprise, Popilius? 
Pop. Fare you well. 
[Advances to Caesar. 
Bru, What said Popilius Lena? 15 
Cas. He wished today our enterprise 
might thrive. 
I fear our purpose is discovered. 
Bru. Look, how he makes to Caesar; 
mark him. 
Cas. Casca, be sudden, for we fear pre- 
vention. 
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be 
known, 20 
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, 
For I will slay myself. 
Bru. Cassius, be constant; 
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; 
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not 
change. 
Cas. Trebonius knows his time; for, 
look you, Brutus, 25 
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

   JULIUS 
With the most boldest and best hearts of 
Rome. 
Enter a servant. 
Bru. Soft! who comes here? A friend of 
Antony’s.. 
Serv, Thus, Brutus, did my master bid 
me kneel; 
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down; 
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me 
say: 125 
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; 
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving; 
Say I love Brutus, and I honor him; 
Say I feared Caesar, honored him, and 
loved him. 
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony 130 
May safely come to him, and be resolved 
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, 
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead 
So well as Brutus living; but will follow 
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus 
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state 
With all true faith. So says my master 
Antony. 137 
Bru. Thy master is a wise and valiant 
Roman; 
Inever thought him worse.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
we Expianatory Notes 
1. All the events of this act take place on the 
ides of March; that is, on the day: after the 
events during the night covered by Act. II. 
2. The first scene presents the achievement 
of the conspiracy. The action is rapid. The 
short, whispered conversations show how much 
everyone except Caesar is wrought up. He is 
unconscious of the suppressed excitement 
about him. 
Questions anp Topics 
1. How does Caesar display arrogance in 
this scene? Why does Shakespeare emphasize 
this trait here? Does Caesar show fear of 
death when death comes upon him? 
2. Is Brutus consistently the patriot in 
this scene? Does he treat Antony as you had 
expected him to? Why does he treat him in 
so friendly a fashion? How does he seek to 
win the support of Antony? Why does he 
allow Antony to speak at the funeral? Why 
does he suppose his speech before Antony’s will 
win the people? 
3. What evidence of the practical alertness 
of Cassius do you find before the blows are 
struck? Does the gentle side of Cassius appear 
after the assassination? Why does he distrust 
Antony? How does Cassius try to secure his 
support? Why does Cassius object to Antony’s 
speaking at the funeral? Why does he interrupt 
Antony’s lament over Caesar? 
‘4. Why does Antony, in his message, com-

express to the conspirators his sorrow for 
“aesar’s death? Do you think Brutus or 
‘assius. the more likely to win his support? 
hat is the surface meaning of each of Antony’s 
reeches? What is the real meaning of each? 
hy does he wish to speak at the funeral? 
hat promise does he make about his speech? 
-Vhat do you learn of his purpose from his final 
soliloquy? Do you think him as practical as 
Cassius? Why are we told that Octavius is 
near?

Antony, 
By our permission, is allowed to‘make.

We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up. 
Ant. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding

Third Cit. He says, for Brutus’ sake, 
He finds himself beholding to us all.

The good is oft interréd with their bones; 
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus 
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious; 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Caesar answered it.

For Brutus is an honorable man; 
So are they all, all honorable men—

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1. This is the greatest acting scene of the 
play. The crowd is much impressed by the 
character of Brutus, but it does not follow his 
reasoning at all. Antony does not try to win 
them by argument, but appeals to their feelings 
so skillfully that he soon overthrows the influence 
of Brutus. The scene shows the rising of the 
movement of revenge. 
2. Although historically the funeral oration 
was some days after the assassination, Shake- 
speare here assumes that it was delivered on 
the same day, the ides of March, only a few 
hours afterwards. This contributes to the 
impression of swift action. 
Questions anp Topics 
1. Why does Shakespeare present this scene 
rather than the one in the “other street” where 
Cassius speaks?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
This scene merely pictures the frenzy of the 
mob which Antony has roused by his speech. 
1. Do youthink the good humor of the crowd 
consistent with its illogical cruelty? 
2. Is the mob spirit consistent with a 
democracy? 
8. Does this scene help the plot of the play?

Acr III as a Waoie 
1. Continue the story of the play as you did 
for Acts I and II, with the summarizing sen- 
tences. What title would be appropriate for 
‘ this act? Make it harmonize with the titles 
of the preceding acts. 
2. Draw up a list of the references to the 
ides of March from the beginning of the play 
What im- 
pression would these references make on an 
audience? 
8. Take up the several appearances of 
Brutus in this act and show whether his actions 
ae consistent with what you already know of 
im. 
4.- In the same way, show whether Cassius 
acts consistently. 
5. Does Antony bear out Brutus’s opinion 
of him? What motives prompt Antony’s 
actions immediately after the assassination? 
Do you think he or Cassius understands human 
nature better? 
.6. Does the Roman populace act here as you 
would have predicted from Act I? Trace the 
feelings of the mob by the speeches of the 
citizens. Do you think a mob of this kind 
could be formed anywhere today? 
7. Compare the two orations as to subject, 
plan, and manner of delivery. Are modern 
orations similar in any respects? 
8. Where in this act does the plot take a 
turn? Is the audience made aware of the 
change then or later? When do the characters 
come to feel the change?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1. In the three preceding acts events have 
moved rapidly. The fourth act must be sup- 
posed to happen a long time after Act IIT. It 
shows the two opposing forces of the play pre- 
paring for the final struggle. 
2, Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus actually 
met in October, B. c. 43, some nineteen months 
after the assassination of Caesar, on an island 
in the river Reno near Bologna. Shakespeare 
puts the scene in Rome for greater simplicity, 
and for the same reason omits all the intervening 
maneuverings and events. It is an interesting 
comment on the actual result of the conspiracy 
that this second triumvirate (rule by three men) 
differed from the private agreement entered 
into by Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey. The 
second triumvirate was a kind of public com- 
mission for carrying on the government. It was 
self-appointed, and carried on with great cruelty 
the absolute autocracy that had been begun by 
Caesar. 
Questions anv Topics 
1, Why do the triumvirs calmly mark friends 
and relatives for death? What does this act 
show of their character? Of their harmony? Of 
their growing strength? 
2. Why does Antony send Lepidus away? 
What do you think of his manner of executing 
Caesar’s will? Has Antony changed since 
we last saw him?

1. After the assassination, there was no man 
in complete control of Rome. The chief purpose 
of the various parties was to avert civil war. 
The republicans could not hold Rome, which 
was in the hands of Antony, but they governed 
the provinces to which they had been assigned 
as proconsuls by Caesar. Cassius went to 
Syria and Brutus to Macedonia. All their 
activities are omitted for simplicity until the

visit of Cassius to Brutus at Sardis. Sardis 
was the capital of Lydia in Asia Minor. The 
scene occurs in B. c. 42, about a year after the 
preceding scene. 
Questions anp Topics 
1. What, do you infer, have been the re- 
‘lations of these two leaders since we last saw 
them? How does this picture of conditions in 
the camp of the republicans compare with the 
picture in the preceding scene? 
2, What traits of Brutus reappear in this 
scene? Is it natural that he should wish to 
conceal the quarrel from the troops? 
3. Is it natural that Cassius should enter in 
an angry mood? Has he shown anger before in 
the play? 
4. Does this scene add anything to the plot? 
Why is it introduced? 
Scene TI. Brutus’s tent. 
Enter Brutus and Cassius. 
Cas. That you have wronged me doth 
appear in this: 
You have condemned and noted Lucius 
Pella, 
For taking bribes here of the Sardians; 
Wherein my letters, praying on his side 
Because I knew the man, were slighted off. 
Bru. You wronged yourself to write in 
such a case. 6 
Cas. In such a time as this it is not meet 
That every nice offense should bear his 
comment. 
Bru, Let me tell you, Cassius, you your- 
self 
Are much condemned to have an itching 
palm; 10 
To sell and mart your offices for gold 
To undeservers. 
Cas, T an itching palm! 
You know that you are Brutus that speaks 
this, 
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your 
last. 
Bru. The name of Cassius honors this 
corruption, 
And chastisement doth therefore hide his 
head.

“What villain touched his body, that dia

And not for justice? What, shall one of us, us, 
That struck the foremost man of all this

But for supporting robbers, shall we now 
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, 
And sell the mighty space of our large 
honors % 
For so much trash as may be graspéd thus? 
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, 
Than such a Roman. 
Cas. Brutus, bait not me; 
Tl not endure it; you forget yourself, 
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I, 30 
Older in practice, abler than yourself 
To make conditions.

choler? 
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

Go show your slaves how choleric you are, 
And make your bondmen tremble. Must 
I budge? 
Must I observe you? Must I stand and 
crouch 45 
Under your testy humor? By the gods, 
You shall digest the venom of your spleen, 
Though it do split you; for, from this day 
forth, 
Tl use you for my mirth, yea, for my

When you are waspish.

Let it appear so; make your vaunting true, 
And it shall please me well; for mine own

I shall be glad to learn of noble men. 
Cas. You wrong me every. way; you 
wrong me, Brutus; 55 
T said, an elder soldier, not a better: 
Did I say “better”?

my love; ; 
I may do that I shall be sorry for. 
Bru. You have done that you should be

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, 
For I am armed so strong in honesty 
That they pass by me as the idle wind, 
Which I respect not. I did send to you 
For certain sums of gold, which you denied 
me; 70 
For I can raise no money by vile means; 
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart, 
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to 
wring 
From the hard hands of peasants their vile 
trash 
By any indirection; I did send 75 
To you for gold to pay my legions, 
Which you denied me; was that done like 
Cassius? 
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?

To lock such rascal counters from his

To cast into my teeth. Oh, I could weep 
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my

Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold; 
If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth;

Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know, 
When thou didst hate him worst, thou

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
This “quarrel scene” is a very fine example of 
the clash between strong personalities—a kind 
of conflict common in drama. It was famous 
in its own day and has been admired ever since. 
Coleridge said, “I know of no part of Shakespeare 
that more impresses on me the belief of his genius 
being superhuman than this scene between 
Brutus and Cassius.” 
Quzstions anp Topics 
1, What is your feeling for Brutus on closing 
this scene? Why does Brutus censure Cassius? 
Does he treat Cassius as an equal or as ‘an 
inferior in the opening of the quarrel? What is 
his opinion of Caesar now? Has his opinion 
changed? Is he at all envious of Cassius? 
How much had a sense of honor and how much 
aneed for money to do with the quarrel? Could 
Brutus afford to accept money collected as Cas- 
sius had collected his? What reconciles the two 
friends? Why does Brutus drive the poet out, 
whereas Cassius laughs at him? Why does 
Brutus say so little of Portia?—from lack of 
feeling or from deep grief? Why do you think so? 
Do you consider the reasoning of Cassius or 
of Brutus the better with regard to the pro- 
posed advance to Philippi? What traits 
come out in the scene with Lucius? How many 
things are implied about Brutus’s tastes and 
disposition by lines 251-254? 
2 Would you have the ghost of Caesar 
appear on the stage? Or should it exist only 
in Brutus’s mind? Why does Shakespeare in- 
troduce it here?

. 3. Why is Cassius angry with Brutus? Why 
does he become reconciled—because he is con- 
vinced he is wrong of because he loves Brutus 
“too well? Where, earlier in the play, has he 
‘been ‘swayed by personal feelings? On what 
earlier occasions have he and Brutus differed 
in opinion? Whose judgment has prevailed in 
each case? Whose judgment has proved 
sounder in each case? What difference of 
judgment arises in this scene? Who prevails? 
4, In the quarrel, on which side do your 
sympathies lie? Would it make a good acting 
scenetoday? Why? 
5. ‘What ‘ideals of friendship are expressed 
during the quarrel? How far do: Brutus and 
Cassius live up to them? Could these ideals 
be lived up to today?

. the meeting at Sardis, Brutus and Cassius took 
their armies into Macedonia, in Europe, to the 
plains of Philippi. There they pitched camp 
on two hills, Brutus to the north of Cassius. 
When Antony and Octavius arrived Antony 
forced Cassius into a battle, during which he 
captured the southern hill and set fire to the | 
camp. The forces of Brutus, without orders,, 
attacked the camp of the enemy. When 
Brutus became aware of the burning of the 
southern camp, he sent out horsemen to find 
Cassius. But Cassius, not being able in the 
dust of battle to tell who the horsemen were, 
dispatched Titinius to find out. The horsemen 
of course received Titinius with open arms, but 
Cassius, thinking that the messenger had been 
captured, had his freedman kill him. When 2 
second battle, twenty days later, went against . 
Brutus, he committed suicide to keep from 
falling into the hands of Antony. 
8. In telling this story for the theater, 
Shakespeare was greatly helped by the kind of 
stage on which the play was produced. As 
there was no scenery to speak of, the stage 
could easily represent different parts of the 
field in rapid succession. Since a few soldiers 
stood for a whole army, the two armies could 
enter, the chieftains could parley, and the 
armies could retire without loss of time. A 
rapid beating of drums would indicate that the 
battle was on in some part of the field. So 
scene would swiftly follow scene until Antony 
delivered his final speech. To catch the cur- 
rent of the story you should picture this hurry _ 
and continual movement. 
4. Antony was at this time about forty, 
while Octavius was barely twenty-one. Yet 
as the adopted son and heir of Julius Caesar he 
carries all before him, Even Antony has to 
give way. 
Quzstions anp Topics 
1. Does Brutus in the parley anywhere 
suggest reconciliation? Where does Antony 
charge the conspirators with murder? Where 
does Cassius remind Brutus of his warning — 
against Antony?” 
2. Do you regard the parley between the 
leaders of the two armies as dignified? Is it 
witty? What part of the audience would it 
please most? Could such a scene occur in 
modern warfare? 
3. What has been Cassius’s attitude toward 
omens in earlier scenes? What is his attitude 
here? Is he inconsistent? ; 
4. Why do Brutus and Cassius bid farewell 
so solemnly? How does their parting make 
you feel?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Questions anp’ Topics 
1. In scene iv, is Brutus a man of action or 
a contemplative man? Which has he been 
through most of the play? Is he in these two 
scenes a heroic or a pathetic figure?” 
2. Why does Brutus have to ask four of his 
companions-in-arms to hold his sword before he 
finds one to do it? + Why do you suppose. Brutus 
had never found anyone untrue to him?) Why 
does he refer to Caesar when he dies? . 
3. How does his death differ from that of 
Cassius? Do you think Antony’s comparison 
of him with the other conspirators just? Is 
his fate due to evil doing or mistaken judgment?

Act V as a WHoLE 
1. Do you think that the play ends properly? 
Should Brutus and Cassius have been kept 
alive? 
2. -How many references are there to Caesar 
in this act? What impression do they make? 
8. Summarize this act as. you have done 
throughout the play. 
GENERAL QUESTIONS ON THE PLay 
as 4 WHOLE 
1. The story of the play should be arranged 
in steps leading to the conclusion. ‘Fhe theme 
of the play is the tragic attempt of the old 
republicanism of Rome represented by Brutus 
78-74, the elements so mixed. The common belief 
was that a man’s disposition depended on the proportion of the elements; for which see note on IT, i, 250. 81. part,

JULIUS CAESAR 
to turn back the new imperialism established 
by Julius Caesar. What are the steps in this 
tragedy? Who conceives the conspiracy against 
Caesar? How is it formed? Why is Brutus 
brought into it? Why does he consent to 
join? What binds the conspirators together? 
What definite plan of accomplishing their 
object do they agree to? What obstacles do 
* they overcome? What speech crowns the 
achievement of their object? 
2. To whom does the cause of Caesar descend 
after his assassination? What deeds of Caesar 
are used to turn Rome against the conspirators? 
What events make clear to the conspirators the 
change jn their fortunes? What does the 
meeting of the Triumvirs reveal concerning 
the party of Caesar? How is the discussion of 
the republican party revealed? Why are the 
republicans overthrown at Philippi? How are 
you made to feel the tragedy of the overthrow? 
8. The essential feature of a drama is a 
conflict of human wills. There is running 
through the play a conflict between the party of 
Brutus and the party of Caesar. Trace this 
conflict. Where does the conflict begin? By 
what steps does the party of Brutus gain its 
ends? Where does it begin to fail? You will 
find it very interesting to determine the exact. 
turning-point of the action. By what steps 
does the Brutus party decline? What brings 
about its final dissolution? : 
4, You will also find a conflict of wills in 
nearly every scene. How does the conflict bring 
out the characters of the persons taking part? 
5. A play is also something to be watched 
on the stage. We speak -oftener of seeing a 
play than of hearing it. Pick out scenes that 
you think would be very impressive, merely in 
pantomime; that is, without words. What two 
or three would be the most impressive of all? 
Why? 
6. Shakespeare’s plays dwell largely upon 
some of the profounder elements of life. Caesar 
represents what we should call imperialism. 
Brutus stands for a republican form of govern- 
ment. What human weaknesses are given to 
Caesar? How is his affectionate nature brought 
out? How often and under what circumstances 
does Caesar’s ghost appear to Brutus? What 
words of Cassius and Brutus acknowledge the 
influence? Why is Caesar stronger after death 
than while alive? 
7. Why was Caesar popular with the com- 
mon people? Were Brutus and his party friendly 
to them or were they striving for power for the 
patrician class? What shows that Flavius and 
Marullus, the tribunes, were afraid of the sup- 
port which the people were likely to give: to 
Caesar? Where does Brutus express the same 
fear of populer support of Caesar? How do we 437 
know that Caesar wished to please the commons? ‘ 
Where does Antony show his reliance on the 
people? How does he win them to support 
Caesarism? Yn what sense did the people cause 
the failure of Brutus? Is your chief feeling 
about Brutus admiration for his character or 
condemnation of his deeds? . 
8. Brutus has been called a shallow idealist. 
Prove or disprove this statement by references 
to the play. 
9. .It has been said that Brutus represents 
the old generation in Rome, and that Antony, 
though only two years younger, represents the 
new generation. If this is true, what were the 
traits of each generation? What ideals did 
eaclf have? What virtues or vices did each 
display? What did each think of the common 
people? What influence did each have with 
the people, and how was it exerted? How 
practical was each? 
10. Brutusexclaims:. 
There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, 
Rough-hew them how we will— 
Show that the play does, or does not, bear out 
this statement. 
11. Antony speaks of Caesar as 
. the noblest man 
That ever livéd in the tide of times. 
Prove or disprove this statement from the play 
itself. 
Topics for Debate. The following topics 
should lead to interesting debates. In any 
debate great care should be used to settle upon 
the exact points to be proved and to bring in 
evidence for each argument by quotations 
from the play itself. 
Resolved: That the play should have been 
named “Marcus Brutus.” 
Resolved: That Cassius was a better leader 
than Brutus. 
Resolved: That political idealists like Brutus 
make poor governors. 
Resolved: That Shakespeare’s representation 
of Caesar is a caricature. 
Resolved: That Brutus was justified in assas- 
sinating Caesar.

  AN INTRODUCTION 
. I 
At the end of the introduction to the 
section on Legend and History, page 211, it 
was pointed out that the selections in that 
part of the book illustrated some of the 
ways in which man as an individual has 
faced, nobly or ignobly, the facts of life. 
In the epic, for example, you are not con- 
scious of the thoughts and feelings of the 
ordinary man, or even of his presence, save 
in the vague way that in battles there must 
have been masses of individuals who were 
fighting, not because of any will of their 
own, but at the command of some king or 
adventurer. The war before Troy lasted 
ten years; it was undertaken because the 
wife of a Greek king was carried off by a 
Trojan youth. The adventures of Ulysses 
among the Pheacians, and his story to 
them of his travels, were the adventures of 
a brave and fate-driven man. You know 
that he had companions, and you know the 
names of some of them, but they are little 
more than names, and nowhere do you, 
get the idea of a society of men and women 
engaged in a common task or working out 
forms of government in which all might 
share. Aeneas was revered as the founder 
of the race whence sprang mighty Rome. 
The Romans, therefore, read the epic that 
told the story of his adventures, as the 
Greeks read the story of Troy and of the 
wanderings of Ulysses, because ° these 
stories were the stories of their national 
heroes. We read them today because of 
our interest in adventure, or because of the 
debt we owe to Greece and Rome, or 
because they were written by poets su- 
Premely gifted. But in all three of these 
great epics, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the 
Aeneid, the main interest is in the deeds - of the heroes, however clearly we. realize 
that into these poems there is also woven 
much that gives a picture of the ancient 
classical civilizations. If we ‘consider our 
own old English epic, Beowulf, we find a 
similar situation. Beowulf went to the 
relief of King Hrothgar, whose warriors 
were being slain by a monster, and his last 
brave deed was the slaying of the-dragon 
that was bringing death to his own sub- 
jects, but the real theme of the poet is the 
bravery ‘of the hero, the spectacular deeds 
that brought him fame. 
- The same thing is true of the romances, 
whether we read the story of Arthur and 
the Round Table, or the romances of a 
modern writer like Sir Walter Scott. The 
heroes are men of high degree, who go out . 
seeking renown. Often they win - this 
renown through services rendered to others. 
They are men of high ideals who do great 
good in the world, but we feel, neverthe- 
less, that it is the hero who counts for most 
and that the people whom he serves are 
altogether secondary in the story. ~ 
In a heroic drama like Julius Caesar 
the same thing is true. The main theme 
is found in the personal ambitions of 
Caesar, Brutus, and Antony. The mob, 
by which is meant the mass of common 
people, is treated with contempt. Shake- 
speare is not to be blamed for this. In 
his. time few authors wrote about people 
of low rank. It is true that the reign 
of Elizabeth owes its greatness in large 
part to the fact that in her long and 
peaceful reign wealth-increased and every 
subject, high or low, had better oppor- 
tunities for decent living than England 
had known before. Of the “rights” of 
the people, however, or of the advantage 
44)
-P-A-G-E-451
442 
of allowing them to have a share in their 
government, we hear nothing. 
All this may be summed up by saying 
that in most of the imaginative literature, 
ancient and modern, up to and including 
Shakespeare’s time, the common man had 
small place and the idea of democratic gov- 
ernment no place at all. Of course, there 
are exceptions. Chaucer wrote intimately 
and with full understanding about very ordi- 
nary people as well as about knights and 
squires, and in his own time, the fourteenth 
century, one of the greatest of English 
poems, Piers Plowman, dealt with some 
of the wrongs and the needs and aspira- 
tions of common folk. It is true, also, that 
the folk ballads dealt with peasants as well 
as with persons of rank, and that Robin 
Hood was a sort of champion of all who 
were oppressed by unjust laws. Still, 
these exceptions serve only to bring out in. 
clearer relief the fact that the immense 
mass of epic, heroic poem or romance, and 
drama, constituted a literature of lords and 
knights and ladies and of their deeds, and 
that the ideals set forth were those of the 
man who séeks personal distinction through 
the spectacular deed. 
It was natural that this should be so for 
two reasons: 
In the first place, literature, until quite 
recently, was written by educated men 
for people of high position who had both 
leisure and the necessary training to ap- 
preciate it. In ruder times, and always 
among ruder people, it is true, the minstrel 
or ballad maker found a hearing, and, as 
we have seen, ballads were made by men 
and women who had no book-learning, and 
were handed down, orally, from generation 
to generation. But literature as a fine 
art, carefully composed and written down 
to be read, whether in manuscript before 
the invention of printing in the fifteenth 
century, or printed by Caxton or some 
other early printer, found little or no 
circulation outside what used to be called 
the upper classes. It was courtly lit- 
erature, Naturally, its subjects and its 
heroes ‘were related to courtly life. If 
peasants appeared in it, they were merely 
the mob. They could not read. Litera- 
ture required a reading public. It re- 
flected, therefore, only that public. MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
The second reason i:

Literature, then, is of interest and vah 
only to people who have attained su 
ficient worldly security an 
enjoy it and who possess the 
ing and leisure that go wit: 
ment. It has always been s

works was Malory’s fine v 
Arthurian romances, printed by Willi: 
Caxton near the end of the fifteenth 
tury. Similarly, when England at the e 
of the sixteenth century attained a feeli 
of national security and prosperity it
-P-A-G-E-452
   
                                                    not previously known, the immediate 
tesult was a long line of dramas by Shake- 
speare and others, a national epic like 
romances, lyrics, and novels such as ap- 
pealed to the cultivated society of that 
time. 
Near the end of the eighteenth century 
a new force appeared. Poets began to see 
in the lives of common people romance and 
mystery. Gray, in his “Elegy,” wrote of 
“the short and simple annals of the poor.” 
He saw, too, that many a man who 
might have gaizied fame was prevented 
from realizing his ability solely because of 
lack of opportunity. Another poet, George 
Crabbe, complained about the false way in 
which poets who lived near the court had 
described country life, with a patroniz- 
ing praise of simplicity and rustic health 
and the advantages of the simple life that 
was not borne out by the facts. He set 
himself, he says, “to paint the cot (rustic 
home) as truth would have it and as bards 
will not.” And greater than these in his 
representation of the tragedy or the 
simple dignity, or the comedy of the 
peasant’s life was Robert Burns, a Scottish 
plowboy, who wrote of the Cotter and 
his family and proclaimed that “the rank 
is but the guinea’s stamp,” that the honest 
man, no matter how poor, is king of men. 
What Gray dimly felt, what Crabbe 
longed to see, what Burns poured forth 
with fiery eloquence, was in process of 
becoming reality. At last the great masses 
of the people were becoming awake to 
their rights and their possibilities. From 
this awakening America achieved in- 
dependence, France cast off her outworn 
system, and England began the process of 
extending the right of participation in 
government to every man. And from this 
awakening a whole new literature was 
born. 
Tt 
Lowell’s poem, The Vision of Sir Launfal, 
is an excellent example of the change in 
ideals. Its theme is the search for the 
Grail, a favorite theme in Arthurian 
romance since the twelfth century. Sir 
Launfal starts out, like the knights in the 
old romances, to win glory. But he learns MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
Spenser’s Faérie Queene, and a host of, 
~ humblest. 443 
that the Grail is not to be found through 
the performance of the deed which dazzles 
the world, but through sharing his scanty 
food with a beggar. He found himself 
when he forgot himself. Hawthorne, in 
“The Ambitious Guest,” handles the theme 
in a different way. He writes of a man 
who sought fame, one who could not bear 
to be forgotten in the grave. But the 
avalanche overwhelmed him, and his am- 
bition was never realized. 
In the poetry of Burns you approach 
the theme from still another angle. In the 
old days lords and ladies were the subjects 
of poetry; here, a simple Scottish peasant, 
his family, and his home life form the 
theme. There is poetry in the homecoming 
of the children on Saturday night. There 
is a healthfulness about them and the lives 
they lead that the courtier may lack. 
Again, in the old days Nature was ignored 
altogether, or was merely the background 
of the story, or was described daintily and 
in ornamental aspects. But Robert Burns 
writes a poem about a mouse, and does it 
so well that his poem will never be for- 
gotten. You have also read some of the 
poems he wrote about the equality of men. 
“Liberty, equality, fraternity,” the watch- 
words of the French Revolution, and the 
“vights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness” of our own Declaration of 
Independence—these are the themes of the 
poems by the Scottish peasant. Poetry 
was reflecting the awakening that was 
bringing democracy to men. 
Now the significance of this group of 
stories and poems, which are representative 
of dozens of others that might be included, 
is that they show how certain democratic 
ideals came to play a part in literature and 
that they define these ideals. They show 
that the happiness and prosperity of 
nations depend not upon a few chosen 
individuals, but upon all men, even the 
They. show that every man 
ought to be given the opportunity to make 
the most of himself. They show that be- 
sides the service rendered by. the -indi- 
vidual hero, there is the service in which 
all men coéperate for the good of all. 
In order to give even more concrete 
reality to these ideals, you will read, in the 
last half of Part IV, something more

about the meaning of democracy. The 
point of approach here is not the political. 
Universal suffrage, laws made by repre- 
sentatives of all the people, government 
officials elected by the people and responsi- 
ble only to them, the whole political 
machinery of democracy—these are only 
means to an end. You will get a new and 
interesting idea of the meaning of America 
if you look at it through the immigrant’s 
eyes. You will find two or three little 
pictures from the past history of America 
that will reinforce this conception. You 
will also get a little deeper knowledge of 
some of the men who have been knights 
and epic heroes-of our nation, men such as 
Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt. MAN AND HIS FELLOWS

THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL 
James Russeit Lowen 
Prevvpve to Part First 
Over his keys the musing organist, 
Beginning doubtfully and far away, 
First lets his fingers wander as they list, 
And builds a bridge from Dreamland for 
his lay. 
Then, as the touch of his loved instrument 
Gives hope and fervor, nearer draws his 
theme, “6 
First guessed by faint, auroral flushes sen’ 
Along the wavering vista of his dream. 
Not only around our infancy - 9 
Doth Heaven with all its splendors lie; 
Daily, with souls that cringe and plot, 
We Sinais climb and know it not. 
Over our manhood bend the skies; 
Against our fallen and traitor lives 
The great winds utter prophecies; 15 
With our faint hearts the mountain 
strives; 
Its arms outstretched, the druid wood 
Waits with its benedicite; 
And to our age’s drowsy blood 
Still shouts the inspiring sea. 20 
Earth gets its price for what earth gives us: 
The beggar is taxed for a corner to die in, 
The priest hath his fee who comes and 
shrives us. 
We bargain for the graves we lie in; 
At the devil’s booth are all things sold, 25 
Each ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold; 
For a cap and bells our lives we pay, 
Bubbles we buy with a whole soul’s tasking. 
°Tis Heaven alone that is given away, 
’Tis only God may be had for the asking; 30 
No price is set on the lavish summer; 
June may be had by the poorest comer. 
«Q; Sround our infancy, an allusion to Wordsworth’s ‘Ode on Intimations of Immortality.” 12. Sinais, the direct object of climb, And what is so rare as a day in June? 
Then, if ever, come perfect days; 
Then Heaven triés earth if it bein tune, 35 
And over it softly her warm ear lays; 
Whether we look, or whether we listen, 
We hear life murmur, or see it glisten; 
Every clod feels a stir of might, 
An instinct within it that reaches and 
towers, . 40 
And, groping blindly above it for light, 
Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers.: 
The flush of life may well be seen ~ 
Thrilling back over hills and valleys; 
The cowslip startles in meadows green, 45 
The buttercup catches the sun in its - 
chalice, . : 
And there’s never a leaf or a blade too mean 
To be some happy creature’s palace; 
The little bird sits at his door in the sun, 
Atilt like a blossom among the leaves, 
And lets his illumined being o’errun BL 
With the deluge of summer it receives; 
His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings, 
And the heart in her dumb breast flutters 
and sings; . 
He sings to the wide world, and she to her 
nest-— 55 
In the nice ear of Nature which song is the 
‘best? 
Now is the high-tide of the year, 
And whatever of life hath ebbed away 
Comes flooding back with a ripply cheer 
Into every bare inlet and creek and bay. 
Now the heart is so full that a drop over- 
fills it; 61 
‘We are happy now because God wills it. 
No matter how barren the past may have 
been, 
*Tis enough for us now that the leaves are 
green. 64 
We sit in the warm shade and feel right well 
How the sap creeps up and the blossoms 
swell; 
We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help~ 
knowing 
445
-P-A-G-E-455
446 
That skies are clear and grass is growing. 
The breeze comes whispering in our ear 
That dandelions are blossoming near, — 70 
That maize has sprouted, that streams 
are flowing, 
That the river is bluer than the sky, 
That the robin is plastering his house 
hard by; 
And if the breeze kept the good news back, 
For other couriers we should not lack; 75 
* We could guess it all by yon heifer’s 
lowing— 
And hark! how clear bold chanticleer, 
Warmed with the new wine of the year, 
Tells all in his lusty crowing! 
Joy comes, grief goes, we know not how; 80 
‘Everything is happy now, 
Everything is upward striving. 
Tis as éasy now for the heart to be true 
As for grass to be green or skies to be blue— 
Tis the natural way of living. 85 
Who knows whither the clouds have fled? 
In the unscarred heaven they leave no 
wake: . 
And.the eyes forget the tears they have 
shed, 
The heart forgets its sorrow and ache; 
The soul partakes the season’s youth, 90 
And the sulphurous rifts of passion and 
woe 
‘Lie deep ‘neath a silence pure and smooth, 
' Ere day create the world-anew.” - Like burnt-out craters healed with snow.

Remembered the keeping of his vow? 95

VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL 
Vv 
As Sir Launfal made morn through the 
darksome gate, 
He was ’ware of a leper, crouched by the 
same, 
Who begged with his hand and moaned as 
he sate; 
And a loathing over Sir Launfal came. 
The sunshine went out of his soul with a 
thrill, 181 
The flesh neath his armor ’ganshrink and 
crawl, 
And midway its leap his heart stood still 
Like a frozen waterfall; 
For this man, so foul and bent of stature, 
Rasped harshly against his dainty nature, 
And seemed: the one. blot on the summer 
morn— 157 
So he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn. 
vi 
The leper raised not the gold from the 
dust: 
“Better to me the poor man’s crust, 160 
Better the blessing of the poor, 
Though I turn me empty from his door; 
That is no true alms which the hand can 
hold; 
He gives nothing but worthless gold 
Who gives from a sense of duty; 165 
But he who gives but a slender mite, 
And gives to that which is out of sight, 
That thread of the all-sustaining Beauty 
Which runs through all and doth all unite— 
The hand cannot clasp the whole of his 
alms, 
The heart outstretches its eager palms, 171 
For a god goes with it and makes it store 
To the soul that was starving in darkness 
before.” 
Preivupe to Part Seconp 
Down swept the chill wind from the moun- 
tain peak, 
From the snow five thousand summers old; 
On open wold and hilltop bleak 176 
It had gathered all the cold, 
And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer’ 8 
cheek. 
It carried a shiver everywhere _ 
From the unleafed boughs and pas ures

The little brook heard it and built a roof 
*Neath which he could house him, winter- 
proof; 
All night by the white stars’ frosty gleams 
He ‘groined his arches and matched his 
beams; 
Slender and clear were his crystal spars 185 
As the lashes of light that trim the stars; 
He sculptured every summer delight 
In his halls and chambers out of sight; 
Sometimes his tinkling waters slipped 
Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt, 
Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed 
trees 191

Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew 
But silvery mosses that downward grew; 
Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief 195

For the gladness of heaven to shine 
through, and here 
He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops 
And hung them thickly with diamond- 
drops, 200 
That crystaled the beams of moon and sun, 
And made a star of every one. 
No mortal builder’s most rare device 
Could match this winter-palace of ice;

In his depths serene through the summer 
day. _ 206

The cheeks of Christmas grow red and 
jolly; 
And sprouting is every corbel and rafter 
With lightsome green of ivy and holly.

‘Wallows the Yule-log’s roaring tide; 216 
The broad flame-pennons droop and flap 
And belly and tug as a flag in the wind; 
Like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap, 
Hunted ‘to death in its galleries blind; 
And swift little troops of silent sparks, 221 
Now ‘pausing, now scattering away as. in 
fear, 
Go threading the soot-forest’s tangled darks 
Like herds of startled deer. 224

But the wind without was eager and sharp; 
Of Sir Launfal’s gray hair it makes a harp, 
And rattles and wrings 
The icy strings, 
Singing, in dreary monotone, . 
A Christmas carol of its own, 230 
Whose burden still, as he might guess, 
Was “Shelterless, shelterless, shelter- 
less!” 
The voice of the seneschal flared like a torch 
As he shouted the wanderer away from the 
porch, 
And he sat in the gateway and saw all 
night 235 
The great hall-fire, so cheery and bald, 
Through the window-slits of the castle

Build out its piers of ruddy light 
Against the drift of the cold.

There was never a leafon bush or tree, 240 
The bare boughs rattled shudderingly; 
The river was dumb and could not speak,

From his shining feathers shed off the

Sir Launfal turned from his own hard gate, 
For another heir in his earldom sate; 251 
An old, bent man, worn out and frail, 
He came back from seeking the Holy Grail. 
Little he recked of his earldom’s loss; 
No more on his surcoat was blazoned the 
cross; : 255 
But deep in his soul the sign he wore, 
The badge of the suffering and the poor.

So he mused, as he sat, of a sunnier clime, 
And sought for a shelter from cold and 
snow 
In the light and warmth of long ago; 
He sees the snake-like caravan crawl 
O’er the edge of the desert, black and 
small, 965 
Then nearer and nearer, till, one by one, 
He can count the camels in the sun, 
As over the red-hot sands they pass 
To where, in its slender necklace of grass, 
The little spring laughed and leaped in the 
shade, 270 
And with its own self like an infant played, 
And waved its signal of palms.

“For Christ’s sweet sake, I beg an alms”— 
The happy camels may reach the spring, 
But Sir Launfal sees naught save the grue- 
some thing, . 278 
The leper, lank as the rain-blanched bone, 
That cowers beside him, a thing as lone 
And white as the ice-isles of Northern seas

And Sir Launfal said, “I behold in thee 280 
An image of Him whe-died on the tree.

As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face, 
A light shone round about the place; 
The leper no longer crouched at his side, 
But stood before him glorified, 305 
Shining and tall and fair and straight 
As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful

That mingle their softness and quiet in one 
With the shaggy unrest they float down 
upon; 
And the voice that was calmer than silence 
said, 
“Lo, it is I, be not afraid! 
In many climes, without avail,

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1, The Vision of Sir Launfal was written in 
1848, when Lowell was twenty-nine years of 
age. In the same year he wrote the Biglow 
Papers, a collection of poems on national ques- 
tions written in the New England dialect, and 
abounding in humor and sharp-pointed satire. 
The two. works are very different in nature; 
they represent the two sides of Lowell’s genius: 
6n the one hand a serious, somewhat moralizing 
idealism, and on the other a pungent humor 
that accompanied a rare critical faculty. While 
he wrote many other poems in the course of his long life, none ase so widely known as these. 
Their very differences give a clue to the many- 
sidedness of their author’s genius. He loved 
the old ballads, the old romances, old plays. 
_ He was one of the most famous of American 
ambassadors, serving in England and in Spain. 
He wrote many essays about English literature, 
and is recognized as one of the greatest of 
critics. His prose. works include also some 
charming personal essays, on such subjects as 
“A Certain Condescension in Foreigners,” 
“A Good Word for Winter,” and the like. He 
also wrote many political papers on the meaning 
of American democracy. Thus Lowell figures
-P-A-G-E-459
450 
as a, lover of romance and the literature of the 
past, and as a man who was also interested in 
. his own time, in its politics and problems. He 
was a man of fine culture who was able to 
telate this culture to everyday life. 
*-g. Sir Launfal was not one of the knights of 
the Round Table, though there is a romance 
in which a knight of this name is the hero. 
The story of this romance, however, is not like 
that of Lowell’s poem, the plot of which is 
original. Lowell’s theme is that of many of 
the old Arthurian romances, the search for the 
Holy Grail, and in order to understand the 
poem you should know something about these 
romances. 
Arthur was a great leader, or chieftain, of 
Britain who lived in the fifth or sixth century. 
Little is known about his life; he was supposed 
to have carried on a great war against Rome, 
and legends also gave him supernatural or 
fairy powers. Early chronicles tell of his 
deeds, but they mix fact,‘or what thay be fact, 
with the fairy elements to such an extent that 
the truth is hard to determine. The romances 
tell of his founding of the Round Table, an 
order of knighthood whose members were 
pledged to right wrong, succor the oppressed, 
and follow the king. The chief knights of the 
Round Table were Gawain, Launcelot, Kay, 
Perceval, and Galahad. 
* Many of the stories about the knights of the 
Round Table relate to the quest, or search, for 
the Grail. The nature" of this object is as 
mysterious as everything else encountered in 
the legend of Arthur. In some old tales it is 
@ marvelous jewel; in others it is a dish that 
had the property of supplying those who 
possessed it with all manner of food. At some 
point in the history of the legend there came in 
a story to the effect that Joseph of Arimathea, 
fleeing to Britain after the Crucifixion, bore 
with him the cup used’ by the Savior at the 
Last Supper. One day this cup, or Grail, 
appeared at Arthur’s court, borne-by mysterious attendants, and then vanished. All the knights 
vowed to give the remainder of their lives, if 
need be, to finding it again. ‘ There are many 
stories about the adventures of Gawain, Launce- lot, Perceval, and others, as they searched for 
the Grail. It was in the possession of a mys- 
terious Fisher King, and kept at the Grail Castle, but this castle could be found only by a knight who was blameless in conduct and pure in heart. 
8, This story supplies the chief inspiration for Lowell’s poem, but he makes several very interesting changes in it. The original story developed, in a succession of romances from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, into an allegory of the Christian life. In place of the MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
earlier quest for the Grail merely to win personal 
distinction, the story came to represent the 
idea that the vision of Divine Beauty can be 
attained only by one who is pure in heart. 
Galahad, as the representative of this phase of 
the growth of the legend, is marked by his 
withdrawal from active life, his devotion to 
meditation and prayer. So purified, he attains 
sight of the sacred relic. But Lowell humanizes 
the story. His Sir Launfal at first is very like 
Sir Gawain or Sir Launcelot, a seeker for 
worldly glory. He tosses an alms to the 
beggar because that is the proper thing to do; 
in reality he recoils from the human wretched- 
ness that the beggar typifies. He is filled with 
self-satisfaction. He feels that the Grail is to 
be found not at home but at the end of wondet* 
ful adventures in distant lands. But he re- 
turns, after a life’ spent in vain searching, to 
* find his castle occupied by another, his money 
gone, himself a broken old man. Just at this 
point he meets once more the beggar, but 
since his heart is filled with love, he recognizes 
in the poor man a brother, a man like himself, 
and he shares with him his crust of bread. At 
once the place is filled with glory. The gift of 
the crust and the drink of cold water becomes 
a sacrament. The rude wooden bowl. becomes 
the Grail.

Questions anp Toptcs 
1. Into what parts is this poem divided? 
Give briefly the contents of Part First. Of . 
Part Second. _ What is the theme of the Prelude 
to Part First? Of the second Prelude? How 
are these Preludes related to the Parts with 
which they belong? 
2. Judging from this preliminary survey, is 
the poem chiefly narrative? Does it have as 
much story as the “Rime of the Ancient Mar- 
iner’? How many incidents are told? What 
kinds of incidents might have been included, 
but are omitted? Is it, then, Lowell’s chief 
Upurpose to tell a story, or to do something else? 
8. Lock now at the introductory stanza 
with some care. Is the organist playing some ~ 
selection that he knows? Why does he let his 
fingers wander “as they list’? What does lay 
usually mean? What do you think it means 
here? What does theme mean? What is the 
purpose of this stanza? Read it over several 
times, until its melody and rhythm are fully 
realized. 
4. Wordsworth once wrote that Heaven lies 
about us in our infancy, but that as we grow 
older the magic and fairy mystery of life depart. 
and fade into the life of common day. What 
do you think this means? Does Lowell agree 
that it is necessarily true? Who climbed 
Mount Sinai? What befell him there? What, 
then, does Lowell mean by saying that we 
climb Sinai daily without knowing it? Note 
the aspects of Nature mentioned in lines 13-20: 
skies, winds, the wood, the sea. The druids 
were priests of an. ancient religion of Nature. 
The oak and the mistletoe were sacred te them. 
Why are the woods called druid? Sum up the 
meaning of these lines (13-20). 
5. The lines next following (21-32) seem 
unrelated to each other, like @ collection of 
Proverbs, but by a little study you can see the 
relation and summarize the passage in a sen- 
tence or two. 
6. You should commit to memory the lines 
describing June (33-56). At first thought they 
may seem unrelated to the story. Keep in 
mind the first stanza, telling about the or- 
ganist, his Jay, and the way in which he tries ° 
various themes until he finds one—~ 
First guessed by faint auroral flushes sent 
Along the wavering vista of his dream. 
These “faint auroral flushes” are present in 
this little poem about June, and the true theme 
bursts upon the poet-musician in lines 80-95. 
7. Read carefully lines 96-108. What im- 
pression do you get as to the character of Sir 
Launfal from what he says about his armor? 
In the old romances a “maiden knight,” that 
38, one just admitted to the order of knighthood, 451 
was supposed to watch or keep vigil by his 
arms all night before setting forth on his quest. 
What lines does this fact explain here? What 
* vow had Sir Launfal made? Do you get the 
impression of humility, or pride, as characteris- 
tic of the knight? 8. In lines 108-127 what confirmation of 
your last observation about Launfal’s character 
do you find? Point out details that contrast 
the joy of Nature with the cold and forbidding 
castle, 
9. Read carefully lines 128-139 and note 
the words that give you an impression of 
sound. What sounds are suggested? Why? 
What words suggest how Launfal looked in his 
armor? Note, as you leave the passage, that 
he was going into far distant countries. Has 
this idea been expressed before? What is its 
significance? 
10. In lines 140-158 make note of the means 
by which the splendor of the knight is con- 
trasted with the misery of the beggar. What, 
effect had the sight of the beggar on Sir Launfal? 
What words are chosen by the poet to make { 
clear this effect? If there was “morning in the } 
young knight’s heart,” why should he have 
felt as he did when he saw the beggar? 
11. The last fourteen lines of Part First 
are put in quotation marks. Does the beggar 
speak them to Sir Launfal, or do they represent 
what he thought as he looked at the piece of 
gold? Do they, in a way, represent the poet’s 
comment? What is meant by 
That thread of the all-sustaining Beauty 
Which runs through all and doth all unite? 
Is there any relation between this idea and 
what the poet has said, in the Prelude and in 
Part First, about the beauty of Nature? But 
how can “Beauty” have any relation to the 
beggar? . 
12. Read aloud lines 174-178, Prelude to 
Part Second. What vowel sound is prominent?. 
What effect has it? What effect is gained by 
calling the snow five thousand summers old? 
13, The Prelude to Part Second contrasts 
the cold of winter with the warmth and glow 
of the June weather described earlier in the 
poem. Yet beauty is the characteristic here. 
A critic has said that there is a contrast between 
the Christmas glee inside the eastle and the win- 
try desolation without, yet the elfin palace of the 
brook is not desolate. Is this a fault? You 
may be helped to find an answer if you think 
back to the lines about the “all-sustaining 
Beauty.” Point out the details by which the 
beauty of the ice-palace is brought out. There 
is happiness within the castle, but is it any 
less selfish than the kind of life implied in the 
description of the castle. in Part First? What

additional contrast is introduced in the closing 
lines of the second Prelude? 
14. What is the final impression of winter 
that the poet wishes to leave with you in the 
opening lines of Part Second? Point out the 
words that make clear this picture. 
15. In line 250 what impression do you get 
from “his own hard gate”? Did he mind the 
loss of his castle? Why? What is the signifi- 
cance of line 255? Contrast Launfal’s appear- 
ance now with what it was when he set out on 
his quest. Why did he call up the vision of a 
sunnier clime (261)? Note the details in this 
picture: the caravan, the hot desert, the oasis 
with its spring of cool water. How does. the 
poet indicate the shock that Launfal felt when 
he heard the beggar’s words and looked at him? 
  MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
What difference do you see between this sur- 
prise and that of the earlier time? 
16. Note ‘the details by which the poet 
gives you an idea of the glory that burst upon 
the knight. Did he realize how the yater and 
the crust were transformed? 
17. Did lines 328-333 surprise you? Where 
has Sir Launfal been all this time? With 
what line, near the beginning of Part First, 
should these lines be connected?. You see now 
the meaning of the title of the poem.

deeds of charity with which you are familiar, 
such as the founding of hospitals and homes for

THE AMBITIOUS GUEST a 
NatHANIEL HawtHorNe 
One September night a family had 
gathered round their hearth and piled 
it high with the driftwood of mountain 
streams, the dry cones of the pine, and 
the splintered ruins of great trees that 
had come crashing down the precipice. 
Up the chimney roared the fire, and 
brightened the room with its broad 
blaze... The faces of the father and 
mother had a sober gladness; the 
children laughed. The eldest daughter 
was the image of Happiness at seven- 
teen, and the aged grandmother, who 
' sat knitting in the warmest place, was 
the image of Happiness grown old. ° 
They had found the “herb heart’s- 
ease” in the bleakest spot of all New 
England.. This family were situated 
in the Notch of the White Hills, where 
the wind wag sharp throughout the 
year and pitilessly cold in the winter, 
giving their cottage all its fresh in- 
clemency before it descended on the 
* valley of the Saco. They dwelt in a 
J, Notch, the name. commonly, given to deep, close Pert Rot certain mountains of Inited States. Craw- 
ard Notch was the scene of the the Galles ‘that suggested cold spot and a dangerous one, for a 
mountain towered above their heads 
so steep that the stones would often 
rumble down its sides and startle them 
at midnight. : 
The daughter had just uttered some | 
simple jest that filled them all with 
mirth, when the wind came through 
the Notch and seemed to pause before 
their cottage, rattling the door with 
a sound of wailing and lamentation 
before it passed into the valley. For 
a moment it saddened them, though 
there was nothing unusual in the tones. 
But the family were glad again when 
they perceived that the latch was 
lifted by some traveler, whose foot- 
steps had been unheard amid the 
dreary blast which heralded his ap- 
proach, and wailed as he was entering, 
and went moaning away from the door. 
Though they dwelt in such a soli- 
tude, these people held daily converse 
with the world.. The romantic pass of 
the Notch is a great artery through 
which the lifeblood of internal com- 
merce is continually throbbing be-
-P-A-G-E-462
    
          
    
            
     
        tween Maine on one side and the 
Green Mountains and the shores of the 
St. Lawrence on the other. The stage- 
coach always drew up before the door 
of the cottage. The wayfarer with no 
companion but his staff paused here to 
exchange a word, that the sense of 
loneliness might not utterly overcome 
him ere he could pass through the cleft 
of the mountain or reach the first 
house in the valley. And here the 
teamster on his way to Portland 
market would put up for the night, 
and, if a bachelor, might sit an hour 
beyond the usual bedtime ‘and steal 
a kiss from the mountain maid at 
parting. It was one of those primitive 
taverns where the traveler pays only 
a homely kindness beyond all price. 
When the footsteps were heard, there- 
fore, between the outer door and the 
inner one, the whole family rose up,. 
grandmother, children, and all, as if 
about to welcome someone who be- 
longed to them, and whose fate was 
linked with theirs. 
The door was opened by a young 
man. His face at first wore the 
melancholy expression, almost de- 
spondency, of one who travels a wild 
and bleak road at nightfall and alone, 
but soon brightened up when ‘he saw 
the kindly warmth of his reception., 
He felt his heart spring forward to 
meet them all, from the old woman 
who wiped the chair with her apron 
to the little child that held out its 
arms to him. One glance and smile 
placed the stranger on a footing of 
innocent familiarity with the eldest 
daughter. 
“Ah! this fire is the right thing,” 
cried he, “especially when there is 
such a pleasant circle round it. I am 
quite benumbed, for the Notch is just 
like the pipe of a great pair of bellows; 
it has blown a terrible blast in my 
face all the way from Bartlett.” 30 Ss THE AMBITIOUS GUEST 
for food and lodging, but meets with. 453 
“Then you are going toward Ver- 50 
mont?” said the master of the house 
as he helped to take a light knapsack 
off the young man’s shoulders. : 
“Yes, to Burlington, and far enough 
beyond,” replied he. “I meant to 
have been at Ethan Crawford’s to- 
night, but a pedestrian lingers along 
such a.road as this. It is no matter; 
for when I saw this good fire and all 
your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had 60 
kindled it on purpose for me and were . 
waiting my arrival. So I shall sit 
down among you and make myself 
at home.” 
The frank-hearted stranger had just 
drawn his chair to the fire when some- 
thing like a heavy footstep was heard 
without, rushing down the steep side 
of the mountain as with long and 
rapid strides, and taking such a leap 70 
in passing the cottage as to strike the 
opposite precipice. The family held 
their breath, because they knew the 
sound, and their guest held his by 
instinct. 
“The old mountain has thrown a 
stone at us for fear we should forget 
him,” said the landlord, recovering 
himself. “He sometimes nods his 
head and threatens to come down, but 80 
we are old neighbors, and agree to- 
gether pretty well upon the whole. 
Besides, we have a sure place of refuge 
hard by if he. should be coming in . 
good earnest.” 
Let us now suppose the stranger to 
have finished his supper of bear’s | 
meat, and by his natural felicity of 
manner to have placed himself on a | 
footing of kindness with the whole so 
family; so that they talked as freely 
together as if he belonged to their 
mountain brood. He was of a proud 
yet gentle spirit, haughty and re- 
served among the rich and great, but 
ever ready to stoop his head to the 
lowly cottage door. and be like a 
brother or a son at the poor man’s fire-

side. In the household of the Notch 
he found warmth and simplicity of 
feeling, the pervading intelligence of 
New England, and a poetry of native © 
growth, which they had gathered 
when they little thought of it from 
the mountain-peaks and chasms, and 
at the very threshold of their romantic 
and dangerous abode. He had trav- 
eled far and alone; his whole life, in- 
deed, had been a solitary path, for, 
with the lofty caution of his nature, 
he had kept himself apart from those 
who might otherwise have been his 
companions. The family, too, though 
so kind and hospitable, had that con- 
sciousness of unity among themselves 
and separation from the world at large 
which in every domestic circle should 
still keep a holy place where no 
stranger may intrude. But this eve- 
ning a prophetic sympathy impelled the 
refined and educated youth to pour out 
his heart before the simple moun- 
taineers, and constrained them to an- 
swer him with the same free confi- 
dence. And thus it should have been. 
Is not the kindred of a common fate 
a closer tie than that of birth? 
@ The secret of the young man’s 
character was a high and abstracted 
ambition. He could have borne to 
live an undistinguished life, but not 
/ \e be forgotten in the grave. Yearning 
‘40 lesire had been transformed to hope, 
and hope, long cherished, had become 
like certainty that, obscurely as he 
_ journeyed now, a glory was to beam 
on all his pathway, though not, per- 
haps, while he was treading it. But 
when postérity should gaze back into 
the gloom of what was now the pres- 
ent, they would trace the brightness of 
his footsteps, brightening as meaner 
‘glories faded, and confess that a gifted 
one had passed from his cradle to his 
tomb with none to recogniz¢ him. 
“As yet,” cried the stranger, his 
cheek glowing and his eye flashing MAN AND HIS FELLOWS

round the White Mountains, but not 
where they could tumble on our heads. 
I should want to stand well with my 
neighbors and be called ‘squire’ and 
sent to General Court for a term or 
two; for a plain, honest man may do 
as much good there as a lawyer. And 
when I should be grown quite an old

to be long apart, I might die happy 
enough in my bed, and leave you all

would suit me as.well as a marble one, 
with just my name and age, and a 
verse of a hymn, and something to let 
people know that I lived an honest 
man and died a Christian.” 
“There, now!” exclaimed the stran- 
ger; “it is our nature to desire a 
monument, be it slate or marble, or a 
pillar of granite, or a glorious memory 
in the universal heart of man.” 
“We're in a strange way tonight,” 
said the wife, with tears in her eyes. 
“They say it’s a sign of something 
when folks’ minds go a-wandering so. 
Hark to the children!’ 
They listened accordingly.

bed in another room, but with an 
open door between; so that they. could 
be heard talking busily among them- 
selves. One and all seemed to have 
caught the infection from the fireside 
circle, and were outvying each other 
in wild wishes and childish projects of 
what they would do when they came 
to be men and women. At length a 
little boy, instead of addressing his 
brothers and sisters, called out to his 
mother: 
‘Tl tell you what I wish, mother,” 
cried he: “I want you and father and 
5 grandma’m, and all of us, and the 
1 stranger, too, to start right away and THE AMBITIOUS GUEST” 
younger children had been put to — 455 
go and takea drink out of the basin 50 
of the Flume.” 
Nobody could help laughing at the 
child’s notion of leaving a warm bed 
and dragging them. from a cheerful 
fire to visit the basin of the Flume— 
a brook which tumbles over the 
precipice deep within the Notch. 
The boy had hardly spoken when a ~ 
wagon rattled along the road and _ 
stopped a moment before the door.. 60 
It appeared to contain two or three 
men who were cheering their hearts 
with the rough chorus of a song which 
resounded in broken notes between the 
cliffs, while the singers hesitated 
whether to continue their journey or. 
put up here for the night. 
“Father,” ‘said the girl, 
calling you by name.” 
But the good man doubted whether 70 
they had really called him, and was’ 
unwilling to show himself too solicitous 
of gain by inviting people to patronize 
his house. He therefore did not hurry 
to the door, and, the lash being soon © 
applied, the travelers plunged into the “they are 
Notch, still singing and laughing, 
though their music and mirth came 
back drearily from ‘the heart of the 
mountain. 80 
“There, mother!” cried the boy 
again; “they’d have given us a ride 
to the Flume.” 
Again they laughed at the child’s 
pertinacious fancy for a night ramble. 
But it happened that a light, cloud | 
passed over the daughter’s spirit; she 
looked gravely into the fire and drew 
a breath that was almost a sigh. It . 
forced its way, in spite of a little oo 
struggle to repress it. Then, starting 
and blushing, she looked quickly 
around the circle, as if they had caught 
a glimpse into her bosom, The 
stranger asked what she had been 
thinking of. “Nothing,” answered 
she, with a downcast smile; “only 
I felt lonesome just. then.”
-P-A-G-E-465
10 456 
“Oh, I have always had a gift of 
feeling what is in other people’s 
hearts,” said he, half seriously. “Shall 
I tell the secrets of yours? For I know 
what to think when a young girl 
shivers by a warm hearth and com- 
plains of lonesomeness at her mother’s 
side. Shall I put these feelings into 
words?” 
“They would not be a girl’s feelings 
any longer if they could be put into 
words,” replied the mountain nymph, 
laughing, but avoiding his eye. 
All this was said apart. Perhaps 
a germ of love was springing in their 
hearts so pure that it might blossom 
in Paradise, since it could not be 
matured on earth; for women worship 
such gentle dignity as his, and the 
20 proud, contemplative, yet kindly, soul 
is oftenest captivated by simplicity 
like hers. But while they spoke 
softly, and he was watching the happy 
. sadness, the lightsome shadows, the 
shy yearnings of a maiden’s nature, 
the wind through the Notch took a 
deeper and drearier sound. It seemed, 
as the fanciful stranger said, like the 
choral strain of the spirits of the blast, 
30 who in old Indian times had their 
f 
40 happiness. dwelling among these mountains and 
made their heights and recesses a 
sacred region, There was a wail 
along the road as if a funeral were 
passing. To chase away the gloom, 
the family threw pine-branches on 
their fire till the dry leaves crackled 
and the flame arose, discovering once 
again a scene of peace and humble 
them fondly and caressed them all. 
There were the little faces of the chil- 
dren peeping from their bed apart, and 
here the father’s frame of strength, the 
mother’s subdued and careful mien, 
the high-browed youth, the budding 
girl, and the good old grandam still 
knitting in the warmest place. 
The aged woman looked up from The light hovered about . MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
her task, and with fingers ever busy 
was the next to speak. 
“Old folks have their notions,” said 
she, “as well as young ones. You've 
been wishing and planning and letting 
your heads run on one thing and an- 
other till you’ve set my mind a-wan- 
dering too. Now, what should an old 
woman wish for when she can go but 
a step or two before she comes to her 
grave? Children, it will haunt me 
night and day till I tell you.” 
“What is it, mother?” cried the 
husband and wife, at once. 
Then the old woman, with an air 
of mystery which drew the circle 
closer round the fire, informed them 
that she had provided her grave- 
clothes some years before—a nice 
linen shroud, a cap with a muslin 
ruff, and everything of .a finer sort 
than she had worn since her wedding 
day. But this evening an old super- 
stition had strangely recurred to her. 
It used to be said in her younger days 
that if anything were amiss with a 
corpse—if only the ruff were not 
smooth or the cap did not sit right— 
the corpse, in the coffin and beneath 
the clods, would strive to put up its 
cold hands and arrange it. The bare 
thought made her nervous. 
“Don’t talk so, grandmother,” 
the girl, shuddering. 
“Now,” continued the old womar 
with singular earnestness, yet smiling 
strangely at her own folly, “I want 
one of you, my children, when your 
mother is dressed and in the coffin, J 
want one of you to hold a looking-glass 
over my face. Who knows but I 
may take a glimpse at myself, and see 
whether all’s right.” 
“Old and young, we dream of graves 
and . monuments,” murmured __ the 
stranger youth. “I wonder how mar- 
iners feel when the ship is sinking 
and they, unknown and _ undistin- said 
  guished, are to be buried together ix
-P-A-G-E-466
o THE AMBITIOUS GUEST 
the ocean, that wide and nameless 
sepulcher?”’ : 
For a moment the old woman’s 
ghastly conception so engrossed the 
minds of her hearers that a sound 
abroad in the night, rising like the 
roar of a blast, had grown broad, deep, 
and terrible before the fated group 
were conscious of it. The house and 
all within it trembled; the foundations 
of the earth seemed to be shaken, as if 
this awful sound were the peal of the 
last trump. Young and old exchanged 
one wild glance and remained an in- 
stant pale, affrighted, without utter- 
ance or power to move. Then the 
same shriek burst simultaneously from 
all their lips: 
“The slide! The slide!” : 
The simplest words must intimate, 
ut not portray, the unutterable horror 
f the catastrophe. The victims 
ished from their cottage, and sought 
efuge in what they deemed a safer 
pot, where, in contemplation of such 
n emergency, a sort of barrier had 
een reared. Alas! they had quitted 
heir security and fled right into the 
vathway of destruction. Down came 
he whole side of the ‘mountain in a 
ataract of ruin. Just before it 
eached the house the stream broke 
nto two branches, shivered not a 
vindow there, but overwhelmed the 
vhole vicinity, blocked up the road, 
ind annihilated everything in its 
lreadful course. Long ere the thun- 457 
der of that great slide had ceased to 
roar among the mountains the mortal 
agony had been endured and the vic- 40 
tims were at peace. Their bodiesp 
were never found. 
The next morning the light smoke 
was seen stealing from the cottage 
chimney up the mountain-side. With- 
in, the fire was yet smoldering on the 
_ hearth, and the chairs in a circle round 
it, as if the inhabitants had but gone 
forth to view the devastation of the 
slide, and would shortly return to 50 
thank Heaven for their miraculous 
escape. All had left separate tokens 
by which those who had known the 
family were made to shed a tear for 
each. Who has not heard their name? 
The story has been told far and widely 
and will forever be a legend of these 
mountains. Poets have sung their ~ 
fate. 
There were circumstances which led 60 
some to suppose that a stranger had 
been received into the cottage on this 
awful night, and had shared the 
catastrophe of all its inmates; others 
denied that there were. sufficient — 
grounds for such a conjecture. Woe 
for the high-souled youth with his 
dream of earthly immortality! His 
name and person utterly unknown, 
‘his history, his way of life, his plans, 70 
a mystery never to be solved, his death 
and his existence equally a doubt— 
whose was the agony of that death 
moment? 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Expianatory Notes 
1. This story is taken from Twice-Told 
Tales, a volume which appeared in its first form 
n 1837, After Hawthorne’s graduation from 
Bowdoin College in 1825 he had lived for 
twelve years in Salem, Massachusetts, writing 
constantly, destroying much of his work, pub- 
lishing little. A few tales appeared in news- 
papers and magazines, but they attracted little 
th attention. Twice-Told Toles was therefore 
Hawthorne’s first important publication. He 
was thirty-four years old, and had served a 
long apprenticeship to the art of writing. More 
than ten years were yet to pass before the ap- 
pearance of his romance, The Scarlet Letter, with 
which, as he says, “Fame was won.” 
2. Twice-Told Tales, as the title indicates, 
is a collection of legends and stories, not origi- oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-467

nal in plot, but retold in such a way as to 
give them a permanent place in our literature. 
Some of them are stories of New England 
history. Others are Indian legends, or legends 
of colonial times. Still others, more original 
in plot, are little descriptive sketches of life 
as Hawthorne saw it. A vein of mystery runs 
through many of them; often beneath the story 
there is a second story, or allegory, such as we 
find in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. Thus 
Hawthorne says, “I myself have followed the 
quest of the Great Carbuncle”; and he speaks 
of himself as sitting by the wayside of life, like 
“a man under enchantment.” This sentence 
gives an excellent clue to Hawthorne’s method. 
He sat by the wayside, looking at the men and 
women and children who passed by, but he 
looked upon them not as individuals, about 
whom he might write as O. Henry wrote about 
the busy broker, but as types of the human race, 
people who were struggling for happiness or 
fame or for some high ideal. 
3. It is in this way that “The Ambitious 
Guest” is to be read. It is based on an event 
that actually happened. In 1821 a family 
named Willey, living in Crawford’s Notch in 
Carroll County, N. H., was destroyed in a great 
slide, or avalanche. The story was told in a 
erude sketch by a man who was building a barn 
about six miles from the scene, who rescued 
his own family just before his house and the 
partially completed barn were swept away. 
Later this man, with others, found the ruins 
of the Willey house and brought out the bodies 
of the people who had been buried in the slide. 
Among them was “a young man about twenty 
years old, named David Nickerson, whom the 
Willeys had brought up.” 
Thus. Hawthorne’s story is a “twice-told 
tale.” It is based on fact, yet the author's 
purpose is not to retell the story in better 
literary form than in the crude sketch written 
by a man who had escaped. The figures are 
.purely imaginary, not portraits of the members 
of the Willey family. They are not even given 
names. The grandmother, the farmer, the 
young girl, the stranger, the children—all are 
portraits drawn in vague and general terms,

And aft he’s prest, and aft he ca’s it guid; 
The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell

The cheerfu’ supper done, wi’ serious face, 
They round the ingle form a circle wide; 101 
The sire turns o’er, with patriarchal grace, 
The big ha’ Bible, ance his father’s pride; 
His bonnet rev’rently is laid aside, 
His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare; 105 
Those strains that once did sweet in Zion 
glide, 
He wales a portion with judicious care; 
And “Let us worship God!” he says with 
solemn air. 
They chant their artless notes in simple

They tune their hearts, by far the noblest

How guiltless blood for guilty man was

How He, who bore in Heaven the second

Had not on earth whereon to lay His head; 
How His first followers and servants sped; 
The precepts sage they wrote to many a 
land; | 132 
How he, who Jone in Patmos banishéd, 
Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand, 
And heard great Bab’lon’s doom pro- 
nounced by Heav’n’s command, 135 
Then kneeling down to Heaven’s Eternal 
King, 
The saint, the father, and the husband 
prays: 
Hope “springs exulting on triumphant wing,” 
That thus they all shall meet in future days, 
There ever bask in uncreated rays, 140 
No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear, 
Together hymning their Creator’s praise, 
In such society, yet still more dear, 
While circling Time moves round i in an

But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard,

1. This poem was written in 1785. Burns 
was then twenty-six years old, and was living 
on a farm at Mossgiel, Scotland. He had 
written a few poems, mainly love lyrics, Nature 
poems, songs, and satires, and these had been 
circulated in manuscript among his friends, so 
that he had some reputation a,

the lowliest things. He: also wrote stirring 
songs of liberty, reflecting his deep-rooted 
Scottish patriotism, his sympathy with the 
struggle of the American colonies for indepen- 
dence, his sympathy for the French. Revolution. 
“Scots Wha Hae wi’ Wallace Bled” and “For 
A’ That” illustrate his love of liberty and 
democracy. The “Lines to a Mouse” and 
“To a Daisy” show his love for humble aspects 
of Nature. He also wrote some of the most 
charming Jove songs in our literature. “The 
Cotter’s Saturday Night” shows the dignity 
of labor and of the peasant’s life. All these 
poems refiect the new movement in English 
poetry spoken of in the Introduction to Part III 
of this book, pages 443, 444, 
- Questions anp Topics 
1. The quotation from Gray is from the 
“Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” 
already referred to (Introduction, page 443) as 
an example of the new spirit of sympathy with 
humble life that began to appear in England 
from about 1750. In the “Elegy” Gray re- 
marks that, given the opportunity, many men 
who lived and died in obscurity might have 
become famous. What principle of democracy 
is apparent in this observation? 
2. Burns’s statement in the first stanza that 
he was not mercenary refers to the old custom 
of dedicating poems to noble or wealthy persons 
who were expected to give money to the poet 
who so honored them. Robert Aiken was one 
of the best friends of Burns, who helped him 
when he was in difficulties and encouraged him 
to write.poetry. Burns never tried to make 
money from his poetry; his statement about 
scorning each selfish end is literally true. 
* 8. Discover a difference in the language of 
the first and second stanzas. Account for this 
difference. Is the language of the first stanza 
simple or bookish? Find other words for 
bard, meed, lowly train, sequestered scene, ween. 
Why do you think Burns used such words as 
these? Which stanzas, later in the poem, are 
Written in the same literary language? 
Which in Scottish dialect? Account for the 
changes. 
4. How many lines has each stanza? Which 
line has more accents, or stresses, than thé 
others? Which lines rime? This stanza is 
called “Spenserian” because it was first used 
by Edmund Spenser, a great poet, contemporary 
with Shakespeare, who wrote a long poem 
called The Faerie Queene. 
5. “Cotter” means “cottager,” one who 463 
dwells in a cottage as a tenant of a farm belong- 
ing to some landed proprietor. What details 
make up the picture of evening given in the 
second stanza? -When had Burns seen these 
things? Is anything mentioned here which 
could not have been seen by any laborer on the 
farm? What is the difference between what 
Burns saw in looking at simple, common things 
and what his companions saw? 
6. What details make up the picture in the 
third stanza? What shows that the cotter is a 
kind father? What effect does his welcome 
home have on him? Point out the details in 
this stanza and in the fifth that prove the in- 
_ dustry, thrift, and happiness of the cotter and 
his family. 7. Is the family a large one? How do the 
older children help with the expenses? What 
little story is told about one of them? Gilbert 
Burns, brother of the poet, said, “Although the 
Cotter is an exact copy of my father in his 
manners, his family devotions, and exhorta- 
tions, yet the other parts of the description do 
not apply to our family. None of us ever were 
‘At service out, amang the farmers roun.’ 
Instead of our depositing our ‘sair-won penny- 
fee’ with our parents, my father labored hard 
and lived with the most rigid economy that 
he might be able to keep his children at home.” 
With this in mind, point out the details in the 
poem that give a true picture of the poet’s 
boyhood home. 
8. Point out the humor in the eighth 
stanza. How can you account for the late 
hour at which supper was served? Of what 
did the supper consist? Was any extra treat 
served by the mother? 
9. Look up the references to Moses and 
Amalek, and Job’s pathetic plaint. What 
is meant by the Christian volume? Who was 
banished to Patmos and there saw wondrous 
visions? 
10. Study the last three stanzas so that you 
can sum up Burns’s ideas on the sources of a 
nation’s greatness. Does it depend on wealth 
and on the nobility? Explain “Princes and 
lords are but the breath of kings.” Do you 
remember a song by Burns in which he ex- 
presses a similar idea? ‘The next line, printed 
in quotation marks is from a poem by Alexander 
Pope, a poet of the early eighteenth century, 
whom Burns much admired. Why does the 
poet fear “luxury’s contagion”? What lines 
show his patriotism? His love of liberty? 
‘Why does he name the patriot bard along with 
the patriot as a defender of liberty?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. The poem was written in November, 
1785. To what circumstances in the life of 
Burns does it refer? 
2. In the second stanza, Burns speaks, half 
seriously and half jestingly, of the way in which 
man’s ambition and cruelty destroy the 
“social union’? that should bind together all 
God’s creatures. On this compare what you 
learned in “The Ancient Mariner.” 
8. How does Burns make clear his sympathy 
with the mouse? What. words seem to you 
especially well-chosen to bring out this sympa- 
thy? Is there a touch of humor? Is there 
anything serious back of this humor? 
4. The best comment on-this poem and 
others that Burns wrote on similar subjects is a 
passage by Thomas Carlyle: “To every poet, 
to every writer, we might say: ‘Be true, if you 
would be believed, Let a man but speak forth 
with genuine earnestness the thought, the 
emotion, the actual condition of his own heart, 
and other men, so strangely are we all knit 
together by the tie of sympathy, must and will 
give heed to him,’ ” 
CREE QUEERY AND MYSY 
DROLLY 
James M, Barrie 
The children used to fling stones at 
Grinder Queery because he loved his 
mother. I never heard the Grinder’s 
real name. He and his mother were 
Queery and Drolly, contemptuously 
so called, and they answered to these 
names. I remember Cree best as @ 
battered old weaver, who bent forward 
as he walked, with his arms hanging 
limp as if ready to grasp the shafts of 
the barrow behind which it was his
-P-A-G-E-474
CREE QUEERY AND MYSY DROLLY 
life to totter up hill and down hill, a 
rope of yarn suspended round his 
shaking neck and fastened to the 
shafts, assisting him to bear the yoke 
and slowly strangling. him. By and 
by there came a time when the barrow 
and the weaver seemed both palsy- 
stricken, and Cree, gasping for breath, 
would stop in the middle of a brae, 
19 unable to push his load over a. stone. 
Then he Jaid himself down behind it 
to prevent the barrow’s slipping back. 
On those occasions only the bare- 
footed boys who jeered at the panting © 
weaver could put new strength into 
his shriveled arms. They did it by 
telling him that he and Mysy would 
have to go to the “poorshouse” after 
all, at which the gray old man would 
2% wince, as if ‘‘joukin” from a blow, and, 
shuddering, rise and, with a desperate 
effort, gain the top of the incline. 
Small blame perhaps attached to Cree 
if, as he neared his grave, he grew a 
little dottle. His loads of yarn fre- 
quently took him past the workhouse, 
and his eyelids quivered as he drew 
near. Boys used to gather round the 
gate in anticipation of his coming, and 
30 made a feint of driving him inside. 
Cree, when he observed them, sat 
down on his barrow-shafts terrified to 
approach, and J see them now point- 
ing to the workhouse till he left his 
barrow on the road and hobbled away, 
his legs cracking as he ran. 
It is strange to know that there was 
once a time when Cree was young and 
straight, a callant who wore a flower 
«in his buttonhole and tried to be a 
hero for a maiden’s sake. 
Before Cree settled down as a 
weaver, he was knife and_ scissors 
grinder for three counties, and Mysy, 
his mother, accompanied him wherever 
he went. Mysy trudged alongside

told that she must be sent to the 
pauper’s home. After that a pitiable 
and beautiful sight was to be seen. 
Grinder Queery, already a feeble man, 
would wheel his grindstone along the 
long highroad, leaving Mysy behind. 
He took the stone on a few hundred 
yards, and then, hiding it by the road- 
side in a ditch or behind a paling, re- 
turned for his mother. Her he led— 
sometimes he almost carried her—to 
the place where the grindstone lay, 
and thus by double journeys kept her 
with him. Everyone said that Mysy’s 
death would be a merciful release— 
everyone but Cree. 
Cree had been a grinder from his 
youth, having learned the trade from 
his father, but he gave it up when 
Mysy became almost blind. For a 
time he had to leave her in Thrums’ 
with Dan’l Wilkie’s wife, and find em- 
ployment himself in Tilliedrum. Mysy 
got me to write several letters for her 
to Cree, and she cried while telling 
me what to say. I never heard either 
of them use a term of endearment to 
the other, but all Mysy could tell me 
to put in writing was: “Oh, my son 
Cree; oh, my beloved son; oh, I have 
no one but you; oh, thou God, watch 
over my Cree!’ On one of these occa- 
sions Mysy put into my hands a paper, 
which she said would perhaps help me 
It had been 
drawn up by Cree many years before 
when he and his mother had been 
compelled to part for a time, and I 
saw from it that he had been trying 
to teach Mysy to write. The paper 
consisted of phrases such as, “Dear 
son Cree,” “Loving mother,” “IT am 
takin’ my food weel,” “Yesterday,” 
“Blankets,” “The peats is near done,” 
“Mr. Dishart,’’ “Come home, Cree.” 
The grinder had left this paper with 
his mother, and she had written letters 
to him from it. 
When Dan’l Wilkie objected to 50

keeping a cranky old body like Mysy 
in his house, Cree came back to 
Thrums and took a single room with a 
hand-loom in it. The flooring was 
only lumpy earth, with sacks spread 
over it to protect Mysy’s feet. The 
room contained two dilapidated old 
coffin-beds, a dresser, a high-backed 
armchair, several three-legged stools, 
and two tables, of which one could be 
packed away beneath the other. In 
one corner stood the wheel at which 
Cree had to fill his own pirns. There 
was a plate-rack on one wall, and near - 
the chimney-piece hung the wag-at- 
the-wall clock, the timepiece that was 
commonest in Thrums at that time, 
and that got this name because its 
exposed pendulum swung along the 
wall. The two windows in the room 
- faced each other on opposite walls, and 
were so small that even a child might 
have stuck in trying to crawl through 
them. They opened on hinges, like 
a door. In the wall of the dark pas- 
sage leading from the outer door into 
the room was a recess where @ pan 
and pitcher of water always stood 
wedded, as it were; and a little hole, 
known as the “bole,” in the wall 
opposite the fireplace contained Cree’s 
library. It consisted of Baxter’s 
Saints’ Rest, Harvey’s Meditations, the 
Pilgrim’s Progress, a. work on folklore, 
and several Bibles. The saut-backet, 
or salt-bucket, stood at the end of the 
fender, which was half of an old cart- 
wheel. Here Cree worked, whistling 
“Qwer the Watter for Charlie,” to 
make Mysy think that he was as gay 
as amavis. Mysy grew querulous in 
her old age, and up to the end she 
thought of poor, done Cree as a hand- 
some gallant. Only by weaving far 
on into the night could Cree earn as 
much as six shillings a week. He be- 
gan at six o’clock in the morning, and 
worked until midnight by the light of 
his cruizey. The cruizey was all the MAN AND HIS FELLOWS

It is an ungainly thing in iron, the

lying open in the mold, was used, and 
the wick was a rash with the green 
skin peeled off. These rashes were 
sold by herd-boys at a halfpenny the 
bundle, but Cree gathered his own 
wicks. The rashes skin readily when 
you know how to do it. The iron 
mold was placed inside another of the

in time the oil dripped through the 
iron, and the whole.was then hung 
by a cleek or hook close to the person 
using it. Even with three wicks it 
gave but a stime of light, and never 
allowed the weaver to see more than 
the half of his loom at a time. Some- 
times Cree used threads for wicks.

CREE QUEERY AND MYSY DROLLY 
it went through the town that Mysy 
now lay in bed all day listening for her 
summons to depart. According to 
her ideas this would come in the form 
of a tapping at the window, and their 
intention was to forestall the spirit. 
Dite Gow’s boy, who is now a grown 
+ man, was hoisted up to one of the little 
windows, and he has always thought 
10 of Mysy since as he saw her then for 
the last time. She lay sleeping, so far 
as he could see, and Cree sat by the 
fireside looking at her. 
Everyone knew that there was sel- 
dom a, fire in that house unless Mysy 
was cold. Cree seemed to think that 
the fire was getting low. In the little 
closet, which, with the kitchen, made 
up his house, was a corner shut off 
jj» from the rest of the room by a few 
boards, and behind this he kept his 
peats. There was a similar receptacle 
for potatoes in the kitchen. Cree 
wanted to get another peat for the 
fire without disturbing Mysy. First 
he took off his boots, and made for the 
peats on tiptoe. His shadow was cast 
on, the bed, however, so he next got 
down on his knees and crawled softly 
w into the closet. With the peat in his 
hands he returned in the same way, 
glancing every moment at the bed 
where Mysy lay. Though Tammy 
Gow’s face was pressed against a 
broken window, he did not hear Cree 
putting that peat on the fire. Some 
say that Mysy heard, but pretended 
not to do so for her son’s sake; that 
she realized the deception he played on 
| © her and had not the heart to undéceive 
him. But it would be too sad to be- 
lieve that. ‘The boys left Cree alone 
that night. 
The old weaver lived on alone in 
that solitary house after Mysy left 
him, and by and by the story went 
abroad that he was saving money. At 
first no one believed this except the 
man who told it, but there seemed 467 
after all to be something in it. 
had only to hit Cree’s trousers pocket 
to hear the money chinking, for he was 
afraid to let it out of his clutch. Those 
who sat on dikes with him when his 
day’s labor was over said that the 
weaver kept his hand all the time in 
his pocket, and that they saw his lips 
move as he counted his hoard by let- 
ting it slip through his fingers. So 
there were boys who called ‘Miser 
Queery” after him instead of Grinder, 
and asked him whether he was saving 
up to keep himself from the work- 
house. 
But we had all done Cree wrong. 
It came out on his deathbed what he 
had been storing up his money for. 
Grinder, according to the doctor, died 
of getting a good meal from a friend 
of his earlier days after being accus- 
tomed to starve on potatoes and a 
very little oatmeal indeed. The day 
before he died this friend sent him 
half a sovereign, and when Grinder 
saw it he sat up excitedly in his bed- 
and pulled his corduroys from beneath 
his pillow. The woman who, out of 
kindness, attended him in his last 
illness, looked on curiously while Cree 
added the sixpences and coppers in 
his pocket to the half-sovereign. After 
all they only made some two pounds, 
but a look of peace came into Cree’s 
eyes as he told the woman to take it 
all to a shop in the town. Nearly 
twelve years previously Jamie Lownie 
had lent him two pounds, and though 
the money was never asked for, it 
preyed on Cree’s mind that he was in 
debt. He paid off all he owed, and so You 50 
Cree’s life was not, I think, a failure. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Why were Cree and his mother given the 
names “Queery” and “Drolly”? Do you think 
that to Barrie they were only queer and droll? . 
What did he see in them that the boys who 
tormented thém failed to see? By what were 
    at

the boys judging? On what did Barrie base 
hig judgment? 
2. In Poe’s “The Gold Bug,” the important 
incident is the deciphering of the cryptogram by 
which the treasure was found—all the rest of 
the story leads up to that, making the reader 
understand why it occurred; in Barrie’s story 
the incidents are so related that each adds 
something to the reader’s understanding of 
Cree’s character; tell how each incident helps 
to put Cree before you.

sketch; what impression of Cree Queery does 
the story give you? Quote passages that show 
Cree’s pride and. courage, revealed in his fight 
against bodily weakness and in his efforts-to 
support his mother and himself; quote lines 
that show his patience; that illustrate his de- 
votion to his mother; that show his honesty; 
that show his unselfishness. 
4. Does Barrie’s character sketch make 
Cree Queery seem a real person to you, one 
who will take-a place in your memory almost 
as if you had known him? Does the author 
tell you that Cree was kind or patient or self- 
denying, or does he present the incidents in 
such a way that you learn these things without 
being told? Point out examples. Relate an 
incident that illustrates some characteristic 
of someone you know, or of whom you have 
read or heard, and then ask some member of 
‘the class to tell what characteristic is brought 
out. . 
5. How are we helped in understanding 
Cree by knowing his surroundings, by seeing 
the house in which he worked? Barrie pictures 
the interior of Cree’s humble cottage so that the 
reader may sce it clearly; show how he adds 
interest to his description and avoids making 
it a mere catalogue of the articles in the room. 
Point out parts of this description to illustrate. 
In what other story in this book is skill shown 
in picturing a home? 
6. What other authors do you know who 
have ability in making their characters seem

RICHARD DOUBLEDICK 
Cuartes Dickens 
In the year one thousand seven 
hundred and ninety-nine, a relative of 
mine came limping down, on foot, to 
this town of Chatham. I call it this 
town because if anybody present 
knows to a nicety where Rochester 
ends and Chatham begins, it is more 
than I do. He was a poor traveler, 
with not a farthing in his pocket. He 
sat by the fire in this very room, and 
he slept one night in a bed that will 
be occupied tonight by someone here. 
My relative came down to Chatham 
to enlist in a cavalry regiment, i* 
- cavalry regiment would have him

not, to take King George’s shilling 
from any corporal or sergeant who 
would put a bunch of ribbons in his 
hat. His object was to get shot; 
but he thought he might as well ride 
to death as be at the trouble of walk- 
ing. 
My relative’s Christian name was 
Richard, but he was better known as 
Dick. He dropped his own surname 
on the road down, and took up that 
of Doubledick. He was passed as 
Richard Doubledick; age, twenty-two; 
height, five foot ten; native place, 
Exmouth, which he had never been 
near in his life. There was no cavalry 
in Chatham when he limped over the 
bridge here with half a shoe to his 
dusty feet, so he enlisted into a regi- 
ment of the line and was glad to get 
drunk and forget all about it. 
You are to know that this relative of 
mine had gone wrong and run wild. 
His heart was in the right place, but 
it was sealed up. He had been be- 
trothed to a good and beautiful girl, 
whom he had loved better than she— 
or perhaps even he—believed; but in 
an evil hour he had given her cause 
to say to him solemnly, “Richard, I 
will never marry another man. I will 
live single for your sake, but Mary 
Marshall’s lips”—her name was Mary 
Marshall — “‘never address another 
word to you on earth. Go, Richard! 
Heaven forgive you!” This finished 
him. This brought him down to Chat- 
ham. This made him Private Richard 
*“Doubledick, with a determination to 
40 be shot. . 
There was not a more dissipated 
and reckless soldier in Chatham bar- 
racks, in the year one thousand seven 
~ hundred and ninety-nine than Private 
Richard Doubledick. He associated 
with the dregs of every regiment; he S 8 Ss 
1. take King George's shilling, a would-be soldier ac- a shilling from the recruiting officer as a symbol of ent. 19. regiment of the line, regular infantry. was as seldom sober as he could be, 
and was constantly under punishment. 
It became clear to the whole barracks 
that Private ‘Richard Doubledick so 
would very soon be flogged. 
Now the captain of Richard Dou- 
bledick’s company was a young gen-. 
tleman not above five years his senior, 
whose eyes had an expression in them 
which affected Private Richard Dou- 
bledick in a very remarkable way. 
They were bright, handsome dark eyes 
what are called laughing eyes gen- 
erally and, when serious, rather steady 60 
than severe—but they were the only 
eyes now left in his narrowed world 
that Private Richard Doubledick could 
not stand. Unabashed by evil report 
and punishment, defiant of everything 
else and everybody else, he had but to 
know that those eyes looked at him 
for a moment, and he felt’ ashamed. 
He could not so much as salute Cap- 
tain Taunton in the street like any 70 
other officer. He was reproached and 
confused—troubled by the mere pos- 
sibility of the Captain’s looking at him. 
In his worst moments he would rather 
turn back, and go any distance out 
of his way, than encounter those two 
handsome, dark, bright eyes. 
One day, when Private Richard 
Doubledick came out of the Black hole, 
where he had been passing the last so 
eight-and-forty hours, and in which 
retreat he spent a good deal of his 
time, he was ordered to betake himself 
to Captain Taunton’s quarters. In 
the stale and squalid state of a man 
just out of the Black hole he had less 
fancy than ever for being seen by the 
captain; but he was not so mad yet 
as to disobey orders, and consequently 
went up to the terrace overlooking the 90 
parade-ground, where the officers’ 
quarters were; twisting and breaking 
in his hands, as he went along, a bit of 
the straw that had formed the decora- 
tive furniture of the Black hole.

“Come in!” cried the Captain, when 
he knocked with his knuckles at the 
door. Private Richard Doubledick 
pulled off his cap, took a stride for- 
ward, and felt very conscious that 
he stood in the light of the dark, bright 
eyes. 
There was a silent pause. Private 
Richard Doubledick had put the straw 
in his mouth, ard was gradually 
doubling it up into his windpipe and 
choking himself. 
“Doubledick,” said the Captain, “do 
you know where you are going to?” 
“To the devil, sir?” faltered Double- 
dick. 
“Yes,” returned the Captain. “And 
very fast.” 
Private Richard Doubledick turned 
the straw of the Black hole in his 
mouth, and made a miserable salute of 
acquiescence. 
“Doubledick,” said the Captain, 
“since I entered his Majesty’s service, 
a boy of seventeen, I have been pained 
to see many men of promise going that 
road; but I have never been so pained 
to see a man determined to make the 
shameful journey as I have been, ever 
since you joined the regiment, to see 
you.” 
Private Richard Doubledick began 
to find a film stealing over the floor at 
which he looked; also to find the legs 
of the Captain’s breakfast-table turn- 
ing crooked, as if he saw them through 
water. 
“T am only a common soldier, sir,” 
said he. “It signifies very little what 
such a poor brute comes to.” 
“You are a man,” returned the 
Captain, with grave indignation, “of 
education and superior advantages; 
and if you say that, meaning what you 
say, you have sunk lower than I had 
believed. How low that must be, I 
leave you to consider, knowing what 
I know of your disgrace, and seeing 
what I see.” MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
“T hope to get shot soon, sir,”’ said 4 
Private Richard Doubledick; “and 
then the regiment and the world to- 
gether will be rid of me.” 
The legs of the table were becoming 
very crooked. Doubledick, looking up 
to steady his vision, met the eyes that 
had so strong an influence over him. 
He put his hand before his own eyes, 
and the breast of his disgrace jacket 
swelled as if it would fly asunder. c 
“I would rather,” said the young 
Captain, “‘see this in you, Doubledick, 
than I would see five thousand guineas 
counted out upon this table for a gift 
to my good’ mother. Have you a 
mother?” 
“T am thankful to say she is dead, 
sir. 
“Tf your praises,” returned the 
Captain, “were sounded from mouth 7 
to mouth through the whole regiment, 
through the whole army, througif the 
whole country, you would wish she 
had lived to say, with pride and joy, 
‘He is my son!” 
“Spare me, sir,” said Doubledick. 
“She would never have heard any good 
of me. She would never have had any 
pride and joy in owning herself my 
mother. Love and compassion she 
might have had, and would have al- 
ways had, I know; but not—spare me, 
sir! I am a broken wretch, quite at 
your mercy!” And he turned his face 
to the wall, and stretched out his im- 
ploring hand. 
“My friend—” began th: 
“God bless you, sir!’ sobt: 
Richard Doubledick. 
“You are at the crisis of your fate. 
Hold your course unchanged a little 
longer, and you know what must 
happen. J know even better than you 
can imagine, that, after that has hap- 
pened, you are lost. No man who 
could shed those tears could bear those 
marks.” ° 
“I fully believe it, sir,” in a low,
-P-A-G-E-480
shivering voice, said Private Richard 
Doubledick. 
“But a man in any station can do 
his duty,” said the young Captain, 
“and, in doing it, can earn his own 
respect, even if his case should be so 
very unfortunate and so very rare that 
he can earn no other man’s. A ‘com- 
mon soldier, poor brute though you 
10 called him just now, has this advantage 
in the stormy times we live in, that he 
always does his duty before a host of          
  that he may so do it as to be extolled 
through a whole regiment, through a 
whole army, through a whole country? 
Turn while you may yet retrieve the 
past, and try.” 
“JT will! I ask for only one witness, 
» sir,” cried Richard, with a bursting 
heart. . 
_ “I understand you. I will be a 
watchful and a faithful one.” 
I have heard from Private Richard 
Doubledick’s own lips that he dropped 
down upon his knee, kissed that 
officer’s hand, arose, and went out of 
the light of the dark, bright eyes, an 
altered man. 
30 In that year, one thousand seven 
hundred and ninety-nine, the French 
were in Egypt, in Italy, in Germany— 
where not? Napoleon Bonaparte had 
likewise begun to stir against us in 
India, and most men could read the 
signs of the great troubles that were 
coming on. In. that very next year, 
when we formed an alliance with 
Austria against him, Captain Taun- 
49 ton’s regiment was on service in India. 
And there was not a finer non-com- 
missioned officer in it~~no, nor in the 
whole line—than Corporal Richard 
Doubledick. 
In eighteen hundred and one the 
Indian ‘army were on the coast of 
Egypt. Next year was the year of 
the proclamation of the short peace, 
and they were recalled. It had then sympathizing witnesses. Do you doubt . RICHARD DOUBLEDICK A471 
become well known to thousands of 50 
men that wherever Captain Taunton, _ 
with the dark, bright eyes, led, there, 
close to him, ever at his side, firm as 
a rock, true as the sun, and brave as 
Mars, would be certain to be found, 
while life beat in their hearts, that 
famous soldier, Sergeant Richard 
Doubledick. - 
Eighteen hundred and five, besides 
being the great year of Trafalgar, was 6o 
a year of hard fighting in India. That 
year saw such wonders done by a 
Sergeant-Major, who cut his way 
single-handed through a solid mass of 
men, recovered the colors of his regi- 
ment, which had been seized from the 
hand of a poor boy shot through the 
heart, and rescued his wounded Cap- 
tain, who was down, ‘and in a very 
jungle of horses’ hoofs and sabers— 70 
saw such wonders done, I say, by this 
* brave Sergeart-Major, that he was 
specially made the bearer of the colors 
he had won; and Ensign Richard 
Doubledick had risen from the ranks. 
Sorely cut up in every battle, but 
always reénforced by the bravest of 
men—for the fame of following the 
old colors, shot through and through, 
which Ensign Richard Doubledick had 80 
saved, inspired all breasts—this regi- 
ment fought its way through the 
Peninsular War, up to the investment 
of Badajos in eighteen hundred and 
twelve. Again and again it had been 
cheered through the British ranks 
until the tears had sprung into men’s 
eyes at the mere hearing of the mighty 
British voice, so exultant in their. 
valor; and there was not a drummer- 90 
boy but knew the legend that wher- 
ever the two friends, Major Taunton, 
with the dark, bright eyes, and Ensign 
Richard Doubledick, who was devoted 
to him, were seen to go, there the 
60, Trafalgar, a famous naval vicory ofthe British over the French and Spanish, at which Nelson was killed, 83. Pentasular War, carried tN 83 pon on against Napoleon in Spain

boldest spirits in the English army 
became wild to follow. 
One day, at Badajos—not in the 
great storming, but in repelling a hot 
sally of the besieged upon our men at 
work in the trenches, who had given 
way—the two officers found them- 
selves hurrying forward, face to face, 
against a party of French infantry, 
who made a stand. There was an 
officer at their head, encouraging his 
men, a courageous, handsome, gallant 
officer of five-and-thirty, whom Dou- 
bledick saw hurriedly, almost mo- 
mentarily, but saw well. He particu- 
larly noticed this officer waving his 
sword, and rallying his men with an 
‘eager and excited cry, when they 
fired in obedience to his gesture, and 
Major Taunton dropped. 
It was over in ten minutes more, 
and Doubledick returned to the spot 
where he had laid the best friend man 
ever had on a coat spread upon the 
wet clay. Major Taunton’s uniform 
was opened at the breast, and on his 
shirt were three little spots of blood. 
‘Dear Doubledick,” said he, “I am 
dying.” 
“For the love of Heaven, no!” ex- 
claimed the other, kneeling down 
beside him, and passing his arm round 
his neck to raise his head. “Taunton! 
My preserver, my guardian angel, my 
witness! Dearest, truest, kindest of 
human beings! Taunton! For God’s 
sake!” 
The bright, dark eyes—so very, very 
dark now, in the pale face—smiled 
upon him; and the hand he had kissed 
thirteen years ago laid itself fondly on 
his breast. 
“Write to my mother. You will 
see Home again. Tell her how we 
became friends. It will comfort her, 
as it comforts me.” 
He spoke no more, but faintly 
signed for a moment toward his hair 
as it fluttered in the wind. The En- MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
sign understood him. He smiled aga 
when he saw that, and, gently turn: 
his face over on the supporting arm 
if for rest, died, with his hand up 
the breast in which he had revive:

but two remaining cares in life, o1., 
to preserve the little packet of hair he 
was to give to Taunton’s mother; the 
other, to encounter that French officer 
who had rallied the men under whose 
fire Taunton fell. A new legend now 
began to circulate among our troops; 
and it was, that when he and the 
French officer came face to face once 
more, there would be weeping ini 
France. 
The war went on—and through it 
went the exact picture of the French 
officer on the one side, and the bodily 
reality upon the other—until the 
Battle of Toulouse was fought. In the 
returns sent home appeared these 
words: “Severely wounded, but not 
dangerously, Lieutenant Richard 
Doubledick.” 
At midsummer-time, in the year 
eighteen hundred and fourteen, Lieu- 
tenant Richard Doubledick, now a 
brown soldier, seven-and-thirty years 
of age, came home to England in- 
valided. He brought the hair with 
him, near his heart. Many a French 
officer had he seen since that day; 
many a dreadful night, in searching 
with men and lanterns for his wounded, 
had he relieved French officers lying 
disabled; but the mental picture and 
the reality had never come together. 
Though he was weak and suffered 
pain, he lost not an hour in getting 
down to Frome in Somersetshire, 
where Taunton’s mother lived. In 
the sweet, compassionate words that

naturally present themselves to the 
mind tonight, “he was the only son 
of his mother, and she was a widow.” 
It was a Sunday evening, and the 
lady sat at her quiet garden-window, 
reading the Bible, reading to herself, 
in a trembling voice, that very passage 
in it, as I have heard him tell. He 
heard the words, ‘““Young man, I say 
10 unto thee, arise!” : 
He had to pass the window; and° 
the bright, dark eyes of his debased 
time seemed to look at him. Her 
heart told her who he was; she came 
to the door quickly, and fell upon his 
neck. 
“He saved me from ruin, made me 
a human creature, won me from in- 
famy and shame. Oh, God forever 
» bless him! As He will, He will!” 
“He will!” the lady answered. “I 
know he is in Heaven!’ Then she 
piteously cried, “But, oh, my darling 
boy, my darling boy!’ 
Never from the hour when Private 
Richard Doubledick enlisted at Chat- 
ham had the private, corporal, ser- 
geant, sergeant-major, ensign, or lieu- 
tenant breathed his right name, or the 
20 name of Mary Marshall, or a word of 
the story of his life, into any ear ex- 
cept his reclaimer’s. That previous 
scene in his existence was closed. He 
had firmly resolved that his expiation 
should be to live unknown; to disturb 
no more the peace that had long 
grown over his old offenses; to let it 
be revealed, when he was dead, that 
he had striven and suffered, and had 
© never forgotten; and then, if they 
could forgive him and believe him— 
well, it would be time enough—time 
enough! 
But that night, remembering the 
words he had cherished for two years, 
“Tell her how we became friends. It 
will comfort her, as it comforts me,” 
he related everything. It gradually

seemed to him as if in his maturity 
he had recovered a mother; it grad- 
ually seemed to her as if in her be- 
reavement. she had found a son. 
During his stay in England, the quiet 
garden into which he had slowly and. 
painfully crept, a stranger, became 
the boundary of his home; when he 
was able to rejoin his regiment in the 
spring, he left the garden, thinking 
this was indeed the first time he had 
ever turned his face toward the old 
colors with a woman’s blessing! 
He followed them—so ragged, so 
scarred, and pierced now that they 
would scarcely hold together — to 
Quatre Bras and Ligny. He stood 
beside them, in an awful stillness of 
many men, shadowy through the mist 
and drizzle of a wet June forenoon, on 
And down to 
that hour the picture in his mind of 
the French officer had never been 
compared with the reality. 
The famous regiment was in action 
early in battle, and received its first 
check in many an eventful year, when 
he was seen to fall. But it swept on

him back to his own history. Then he 
recalled his preserver’s dying words, 
and thought, “It comforts her.” 
One day he woke out of a sleep, 
refreshed, and asked her to read to 
him. But the curtain of the bed, 
softening the light, which she always 
drew back when he awoke, that she 
might see him from her table at the 
10 bedside where she sat at work, was 
held -undrawn; and a woman’s voice 
spoke, which was not hers. 
“Can you bear to see a stranger?” 
it said softly. ‘Will you like to see 
a stranger?” . 
“Stranger!” he repeated. _The voice 
awoke old memories, before the days 
of Private Richard Doubledick. 
“A stranger now, but not a stranger 
% once,” it said in tones that thrilled 
him. “Richard, dear Richard, lost 
through so many years, my name—” 
He cried out her name, “Mary,” and 
she held him in her arms, and his head 
lay on her bosom. 
“IT am not breaking a rash vow, 
Richard. These are not Mary Mar- 
shall’s lips that speak. I have an- 
other name.” / 
w She was married. 
“I have another name, Richard. 
Did you ever hear it?” 
“Never!” . 
He looked into her face, so pen- 
sively beautiful, and wondered at the 
smile upon it through her tears. 
“Think again, Richard. Are you 
sure you never heard my altered 
name?” 
“Never!” : 
“Don’t move your head to look at 
me, dear Richard. Let it lie here, 
while I tell my story. I loved a gen- 
erous, noble man; loved him with my 
whole heart; loved him for years and 
years; loved him faithfully, devotedly; 
loved him with no hope of return; loved him, knowing nothing of his 
highest qualities—not even knowing -that he was alive. A415 
soldier. He was honored and beloved 
by thousands of thousands, when the 
mother of his dear friend found me, 
and showed me that in all his triumphs 
he had never forgotten me. He was 
wounded in a great battle. He was 
brought, dying, here, into Brussels. 
I came to watch and tend him, as I 
would have joyfully gone, with such 
a purpose, to the dreariest ends of the 60 
earth. When he knew no one else, 
he knew me. When he suffered most, 
he bore his sufferings barely murmur- 
ing, content to rest his head where 
yours rests now. When he lay at the 
point of death, he married me, that 
he might call me Wife before he died. 
And the name, my dear love, that I 
took on that forgotten night—”. 
“TI know it now!” he sobbed. “The 70

that my mind is quite restored! My

Well! They were happy. It was 
a long recovery, but they were happy 
through it all. The snow had melted 80 
on the ground, and the birds were 
singing in the leafless thickets of the 
early spring, when those three were 
first able to ride out together, and 
when people flocked about the open 
carriage to cheer and congratulate 
Captain Richard Doubledick. 
But even then it became necessary 
for the Captain, instead of returning 
to England, to complete his recovery 90

within a ride of the old town of 
Avignon, and within view of its 
broken bridge, which was all they 
could desire; they lived there, to- 
gether, six months; then returned to 
England. Mrs. Taunton, growing old He was a brave 50

after three years—though not so old 
as that her bright, dark eyes were 
dimmed—and remembering that her 
strength had been benefited by the 
change, resolved to go back for a year 
to those parts. So she went with a 
faithful servant, who had often carried 
her son in his arms; and she was to 
be rejoined and escorted home, at the 
year’s end, by Captain Richard 
Doubledick. 
She wrote regularly to her chil- 
dren, as she called them now, and 
they to her. She went to the neigh- 
borhood of Aix; and there, in their 
own chateau near the farmer’s house 
she rented, she grew into intimacy 
with a family belonging to that part 
of France. The intimacy began in 
her often meeting among the vine- 
yards a pretty child, a girl with a 
most compassionate heart, who was 
never tired of listening to the solitary 
English lady’s stories of her poor son 
and the cruel wars. The family were 
as gentle as the child, and at length 
she came to know them so well that 
she accepted their invitation to pass 
the last month of her residence abroad 
under their roof. All this intelligence 
‘she wrote home, piecemeal as it came 
about, from time to time; and at last

neighborhood, the honor of the com-

Captain Doubledick, now a hardy, 
handsome man in the full vigor of 
life, broader across the chest and 
shoulders than he had ever been be- 
fore, dispatched a courteous reply, 
and followed it in person. Traveling

the better days on which the world 
had fallen. The corn was golden, not 
drenched in unnatural red; was bound a 
in sheaves for food, not trodden under- 
foot by men in mortal fight. The 
smoke rose up from peaceful hearths, 
not blazing ruins. The carts were 
laden with the fair fruits of the earth, 
not with wounds and death. To him 
who had so often seen the terrible re- 
verse, these things were beautiful 
indeed, and they brought him in a 
softened spirit to the old chateau near ¢ 
Aix upon a deep-blue evening. 
_ It was a large chateau of the genuine 
old ghostly kind, with round towers, 
and extinguishers, and a high leaden 
roof, and more windows than Aladdin’s 
Palace. The lattice blinds. were all 
thrown open after the heat of the day, 
and there were glimpses of rambling 
walls -and corridors within. Then 
there were immense out-buildings fal-_ 
len into partial decay, masses of dark 
trees, terrace-gardens, balustrades; 
tanks of water, too weak to play and 
too dirty to work; statues, weeds, and 
thickets of iron railing that seemed 
to have overgrown themselves like 
the shrubberies, and to have branched 
out in all manner of wild shapes. 
The entrance doors stood open, as 
doors often do in that country when 
the heat of the day is past; and the 
Captain saw no bell or knocker, and 
walked in. 
He walked into a lofty stone hall, 
refreshingly cool and gloomy after the 
glare of a southern day’s travel. Ex. 
tending along the four sides of thi 
hall was a gallery, leading to suites o! 
rooms; and it was lighted from th 
top. Still no bell was to be seen. 
“Faith,” said the Captain halting. 
ashamed of the clanking of his boots. 
“this is a ghostly beginning!’ 
He started back, and felt his fac

down at him, stood the French officer 
—the officer whose picture he had 
carried in his mind so long and so far. 
Compared with the original, at last— 
in every lineament how like it was! 
He moved, and disappeared, and 
Captain Richard Doubledick heard 
his steps coming quickly down into 
the hall. He entered through an 
archway. There was a bright, sudden 
jook upon his face, much such a look 
as it had worn in that fatal moment. 
Monsieur le Capitaine Richard Dou- 
pledick? Enchanted to receive him! 
A thousand apologies! The servants 
were all out in the air. There was a 
little féte among them in the garden. 
In effect, it was the féte day of my 
daughter, the little cherished and pro- 
tected of Madame Taunton. 
He was so gracious and so frank that 
Monsieur le Capitaine Richard Double- 
dick could not withhold his hand. 
“It is the hand of a brave English- 
man,” said the French officer, re- 
taining it while he spoke. “I could 
respect a brave Englishman, even as 
my foe, how much more as my friend! 
Talso am a soldier.” 
“He has not remembered me, as I 
have remembered him; he did not 
take such note of my face, that day, 
as I took of his,” thought Captain 
Richard Doubledick. ‘How shall I 
tell him?” 
The French officer conducted his 
guest into. a garden and presented 
him to his wife, an engaging and beau- 
tiful woman, sitting with Mrs. Taun- 
ton in a whimsical old-fashioned 
pavilion. His daughter, her fair young 
face beaming with joy, came running 
to embrace him; and there was a boy 
baby to tumble down among the 
orange trees on the broad steps, in 
making for his father’s legs. A multi- 
tude of children visitors were dancing 
to sprightly music, and all the servants 
and peasants about the chéteau were . and how shall I tell him?” 477 
dancing too. It was a scene of inno- 
cent happiness that might have been 
invented for the climax of the scenes 
of peace which had soothed the Cap- 
tain’s journey. 
He looked on, greatly troubled in 
his mind, until a resounding bell rang, 
and the French. officer begged to 
show him his rooms. They went up- 
stairs into the gallery from which the 
officer had looked down; and Monsieur 
le Capitaine Richard Doubledick was 
cordially welcomed to a grand outer 
chamber, and a smaller one within, 
all clocks and draperies, and hearths, 
and brazen dogs, and tiles, and cool 
devices, and elegance, and vastness. 
“You were at Waterloo,” said the 
French officer. : 
“TY was,” said Captain Richard 
Doubledick. “And at Badajos.” 
Left alone with the sound of his 
own stern voice in his ears, he sat 
down. to consider, “What shall I do, 
At that 
time, unhappily, many deplorable 
duels had been fought between Eng- 
lish and French officers, arising out 
of the recent war; and these duels, 
and how to. avoid this officer’s hospi- 
tality, were the uppermost thought in 
Captain Richard Doubledick’s mind. 
He was thinking, and letting the 
time run out in which he should have 
dressed for dinner, when Mrs. Taunton 
spoke to him outside the door, asking 
if he could give her the letter he had 
brought from Mary. “His mother, 
above all,” the Captain thought. 
“How shall I tell her?” 
“You will form a friendship with 
your host, I hope,” said Mrs. Taunton, 
whom he hurriedly admitted, “that 
will last for life. He is so true- 
hearted ‘and so generous, Richard, 
that you can hardly fail to esteem one 
another. If he had been spared,” 
she kissed, not without tears, the 
locket in which she wore his hair, 50
-P-A-G-E-487

“he would have appreciated him 
with his own magnanimity, and would 
have been truly happy that the evil 
days were past which made such a 
man his enemy.” 
She left the room; and the Captain 
walked, first to one window, whence 
he could see the dancing in the garden, 
then to another window, whence he 
could see the smiling prospect and the 
peaceful vineyards. 
“Spirit of my departed friend,” said 
he, “is it through thee these better 
thoughts are rising in my mind? Is 
it thou who hast shown me, all the 
way I have been drawn to meet this 
man, the blessings of the altered time? 
Is it thou who hast sent thy stricken 
mother to me, to stay my angry hand? 
Is it from thee the whisper comes, that 
this man did his duty as thou didst— 
and as I did, through thy guidance, 
which has wholly saved me here on 
earth—and that he did no more?” 
He sat down, with his head buried 
in his hands, and, when he rose up, 
made the second strong resolution of 
his life—that neither to the French 
officer, nor to the mother of his 
departed friend, nor to any soul, while 
either of the two was living, would he 
breathe what only he knew. And 
when he ‘touched that French officer’s 
glass with his own, that day at dinner, 
he secretly forgave him in the name 
of the Divine Forgiver of injuries. 
Here I ended my story as the first 
Poor Traveler. But if I had told it 
now, I could have added that the time 
has since come when the son of Major 
Richard Doubledick, and the son of 
that French officer, friends as their 
fathets were before them, fought side 
by side in one cause, with their re- 
spective nations, like long-divided 
brothers whom the better times have 
brought together, fast united.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This little poem is a sustained comparison 
between the farmer’s sowing of seed under 
what may seem discouraging circumstances 
and the work of the patriot or good citizen in 
behalf of the cause of liberty. The farmer must 479 
wait for his reward; he may not be alive when 
the time of reaping comes; his work may be 
for others. So with the patriotic citizen: he 
does not serve for the sake of immediate gain, 
but in order that future generations may live 
more securely. 
2. Such a comparison as this is called a 
simile. Look up the word in the Index of 
Special Terms, at. the end of the book, for 
other examples. 
8. Study with special. care the first five 
stanzas, The first two lay the foundation for 
the simile, or comparison. In what ways are 
the husbandmen and the patriot alike? When 
Whittier wrote, America was free; what then 
does the poet mean by his references to “ven- 
tures” and trusting “to warmer sun”? In the 
fourth and fifth stanzas how is the simile 
advanced? Think carefully upon the fifth 
stanza. Then re-read the first two lines of the 
same stanza. What is “God’s great thought”? 
Commit this stanza to memory. 
4. This poem may serve as a transition 
between the group of selections you have just 
been reading and those that immediately 
follow. You have beén reading about certain 
illustrations, told in story form, of ideals of 
service. A man lives not for himself alone, 
but for others. He lives most intelligently for 
himself, that is, he advances in power and happi- 
ness, when he gives up thinking about himself 
as the center of his world. The selections that 
follow illustrate this relationship between man 
and his fellows from a slightly different angle. 
Instead of stories about individuals you will 
find comments in prose and verse upon the 
meaning of this ideal in a democracy. De- 
mocracy is not a form of government; it is a 
partnership, 2 brotherhood. The suggestion 
is in Whittier’s poem. Read it once more, try 
to see it clearly, and try to get, with special 
clearness, the poet’s idea that this “great 
thought” of Freedom is one requiring two 
things to bring it into reality: codperation in 
service, and working as the husbandman 
works, inspired by the vision of a harvest that 
is to bless mankind after seed-time and growth- . 
time are past.

parrot, which, with eyes shut, sat 
10 upon his perch while the organ played 
_and the monkey performed. No doubt 
‘the parrot was trying to forget this 
wretched company, and was dreaming 
of the far-off paradise which once was 
his. 
Now kreutzers, the small coin of our 
realm, were rather rare in the pockets 
of little boys. Inasmuch as the par- 
8. kreutzer, the Austrian kreutzer is meant, worth at 
the old normal rate of exchange a little less than half a cent 
in American money. rot was announced to be a celebrated 
fortune-teller, I wanted to prove him; » 
so I teased my dear mother just long 
enough to get the coveted number of 
coins. 
With an air of great importance I 
pushed through the crowd which en- 
circled the Italian, and the eyes of the 
multitude were upon me. At least 
I thought they were, although in 
reality they were fixed on the parrot; 
for there had been long dispute as to # 
whether he was alive or not. His 
master took my money and struck the 
perch upon which the bird sat im- 
movable, with eyes shut. Quizzically 
it cocked its head, looked at the prom- 
ised reward in the hand of its trainer, 
then majestically descended, drew an 
envelope out of a row, which no doubt 
held the fate of all youths of my age, 
and dropped it upon the little table. « 
Thus my fortune was told, and my 
fate sealed,
-P-A-G-E-490
AMERICA! 
The crowd urged me to open it, but 
I ran home as fast as I could, reading 
as Iran. Even before the house was 
reached I cried out breathlessly, 
““Mother, I am going to America, and 
I am going to marry a rich wife.” 
“T told you,” said the dear mother, 
with a smile which concealed a tear, 
“‘you would waste your money. You 
lo will stay at home with your widowed 
mother and be her solace in her old 
age.” 
Then she took me out into the 
showed me the boundaries of our small 
estate: the poppy field, the cabbage 
patch, the prune trees—all the land 
from the pottock, the creek, to the 
edge of the dusty highway. 
2 “This,” she said, “will be yours, 
my son, and you will get a good, pious 
wife right here, rather than to go 
among the Indians and marry a wild 
woman.” 
In spite of the allurements offered, 
my ‘imagination was fired by the 
parrot’s prophecy, and that evening 
I sought out my teacher and asked 
him how to go to America. 
30 “It is so far, my boy,” he said, 
“that you will never reach there. It 
is one day by the omnibus, four days 
and nights by the railroad, and then 
across the yam—the great sea—for 
fourteen days. . 
“A ship,” he continued, “does not 
go like the omnibus, but like a nut- 
shell on the pottock, and you may at 
any moment be spilled over and eaten 
40 by the fish.” 
Long, long after this, my boyhood 
outgrown, a part of the parrot’s proph- 
ecy was to be fulfilled.   
* * * . 
In the part of the world where I 
lived there were, as everywhere, the 
rulers and the ruled, the oppressors and 
the oppressed: viz., the Magyars and 
the Slovaks. The latter have never garden under the big pear tree, and. 481 
been strong enough to gain national 
independence, although once. there 50 
was a Slovak kingdom, and they 
cherish the memory of a great king 
whose name was Svatopluk. The 
warlike .Magyars easily subjugated 
these agricultural Slavs, and they re- 
mained an unawakened, half-stupid, 
servile race. My natural feeling for 
the oppressed was intensified by the 
fact that in spite of their many faults 
they were a lovable people. . . . I 6o 
sensed their wrongs in my childhood 
and felt them keenly’ as I grew into 
manhood, especially after I came in 
touch with the revolutionary litera- 
ture of that period. IJ think that 
most boys pass through some such 
heroic stage, where the thought of 
martyrdom seems like wine in ‘their 
blood. I was at that age and - 
mitted. many a senseless indiscretion® 70 
One day, when I was at home during 
the Pentecostal vacation after a severe 
examination period, a copyist from 
the judge’s office came to my mother 
and told her that for a certain sum 
he would reveal to her an official 
secret, which would save me from 
falling into the hands of the vengeful 
government. I am fairly sure I was 
liable to a reprimand or a slight so 
punishment, and that the shrewd 
copyist played on the fears of a Jewish 
mother who loved her boy and feared 
the law. Before I knew it I was on 
my way to America, the copyist 
promising to hold the secret till I 
should be safe across the border. 
Within three days of my leaving home 
I was on the big yam, the ship did act 
like a nutshell on the potiock, and I 90 
wished many a time that I had left 
the parrot dreaming on his perch 
instead of waking him to prophesy 
for me so awful a fate. 
When I went down for the first 
time into the steerage, no one said a 
word of cheer, no one waved farewell.
-P-A-G-E-491

I left strangers standing on the re- 
ceding wharf and I was among eleven 
hundred strangers. I was going to a 
land full of strangers, and when I 
reached my bunk in a dark, deep 
corner of the hold, something which 
felt like a cold, icy hand gripped my 
heart. When the ship left its.moor- 
ing I felt as if my heartstrings were 
breaking, and I stretched out my 
hands to the fast-receding shore, as 
if to grasp the loosened cables. I 
dimly felt what it meant, but I did 
not realize how new was the life which 
awaited me, or how completely I 
was being severed from my past and 
my former self. 
* * * 
It was a wonderful group which I 
gathered around me ‘on that first 
journey, and many of them are still 
my friends, although they have 
climbed out of the steerage and are 
traveling through life in cabins of 
various grades. Every steerage has 
someone who makes a clown of him- 
self, who rejoices in playing pranks 
and does not become angry if the 
pranks are turned on him. This one 
had: such a clown, who led a jolly 
crew into all sorts of mischief, and 
out of it, and many a weary day 
passed less wearily because of his 
jollity. There were strange, awful 
hours when the waves came thunder- 
ing over the deck and the wind played 
among the rigging, when the ship 
twisted and groaned in agony and we 
thought every moment was our last. 
After the storm there came calm and 
sunny days when gulls circled the 
ship and rested upon the quiet deep, 
and a tiny shore bird, driven by the 
wind, sought shelter on the deck. 
In the distance sails glided into view 
and disappeared; a long line of smoke 
betrayed the presence of many boats 
whose routes were to converge at the 
- great port. The pilot came on board MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
and we passed the Fire Ship, which 
guards the channel. Then the hours x 
grew heavy and the morrow loomed 
with its uncertainty. 
It dawned, with its ozone-laden air 
and azure sky, and in the far distance 
that which looked like a cloud grew 
clear and remained immovable—land! 
Then the rapture of it struggled with 
the care and burden and rose tri- 
umphantly over them. 
America! we were in the magic, holy « 
land—America! I have seen this 
rapture and felt it; I have rejoiced in 
it when others felt it, and I want all 
those to taste it who come and come 
again. Therefore, I have gone back 
and forth, and I should like to go 
unwearyingly on to guide men into 
this rapture and to interpret to them 
its meaning. 
I should like the entrance into the » 
United States to be a poem to all who 
come, and not the horrible tragedy 
into which it often resolves itself when 
the first ecstasy is over. All the way 
across the sea I would make of every 
ship a school, with such fair comforts 
as men are entitled to, for their 
money. 
I should like to teach them that 
they may enter without fear and « 
without uttering a lie, so that those 
at the gate might know that these new- 
comers are human, and treat them as 
such, so long as they conduct them- 
selves properly. 
I should like to teach the strangers 
that there is a fair reward for hard 
struggle and an honest living wage for 
an honest day’s work. I should like 
to tell them that their health will 9 
be guarded in mines and factories and 
that their bodies and souls have value 
to man and to God. 
I should like to point to the Goddess 
of Liberty and say that she welcomes 
all who come in her name, and she 
guarantees freedom to all who obey
-P-A-G-E-492
10 WHAT AMERICA MEANS TO ME’ 
law, that our law is always reasonable 
and that, if it is a burden, it falls upon 
the shoulders of rich and poor alike. 
I should like to tell them that they 
have nothing to fear in this country 
except their own frailties, that there 
are no barriers here but their own 
clannishness, and that the way to 
the best is open to all who walk 
reverently. This and more I should 
like to be able to teach; fragments of 
it I have taught, more of it than many 
of them will find true, I fear. But to 
me so much of it has been true that I 
should like to have all men find it so. 
I have suffered much here, I have 
gone the whole scale of hunger, sorrow, 
and despair; yet I say it again and 
again, “Holy America! Holy Amer- 
ica!’ And I want all men to be able 
to say it, as they said it with me under. 
the lee of the land where free men live.

THE CITIZEN 
James Francis DwyEr 
The President of the United States 
was speaking. His audience com- 
prised two thousand foreign-born men 
who had just been admitted to citizen- 
ship. They listened intently, their 
faces, aglow with the light of a new- 
born patriotism, upturned to the 
calm, intellectual face of. the first 
citizen of the country they now 
claimed as their own. 10 
Here and there among the newly- 
made citizens were wives and chil- 
dren. The women were proud of 
their men. They looked at them 
from time to time, their faces showing 
pride and awe. 
One little woman, sitting immedi- 
ately in front of the President, held 
the hand of a big, muscular man and 
stroked it softly. The big man was 20 
looking at the speaker with great 
blue eyes that were the eyes of a 
dreamer. 
The President’s words came clear 
and distinct:
-P-A-G-E-493
10 484 
You were drawn across the ocean by 
some beckoning finger of hope, by some 
belief, by some vision of a new kind of 
justice, by some expectation of a better 
kind of life. You dreamed dreams of 
this country, and I hope you brought 
the dreams with you. A man enriches 
the country to which he brings dreams, 
and you who have brought them have 
enriched America. 
The big man made a curious chok- 
ing noise, and his wife breathed a 
soft “Hush!’’, The giant was strangely 
affected. 
The President continued: 
No doubt you have been disappointed 
in some of us, but remember this, if we 
have grown at all poor in the ideal, you 
brought some of it with you. A man 
does not go out to seek the thing that is 
not in him. A man does not hope for 
the thing that he does not believe in, 
and if some of us have forgotten what 
America believed in, you at any rate 
imported in your own hearts a renewal 
of the belief. Each of you, I am sure, 
brought a dream, a glorious, shining 
dream, a dream worth more than gold 
or silver, and that is the reason that I, 
for one, make you welcome. 
The big man’s eyes were fixed. 
His wife shook him gently, but he 
did not heed her.- He was looking 
through the presidential rostrum, 
through the big buildings behind it, 
looking out over leagues of space to 
a snow-swept village that huddled on 
an island in the Beresina, the swift- 
flowing tributary of the mighty 
Dnieper, an island that looked like 
a black bone stuck tight in the maw 
of the stream. 
‘It was in the little village on the 
Beresina ‘that the Dream came to 
Ivan Berloff, Big Ivan of the Bridge. 
The Dream came in the spring. 
38,40. Beresina, Daieper, rivers of western Bussia, MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
All great dreams come in the spring, 
and the Spring Maiden who brought 
Big Ivan’s Dream was more than 
ordinarily beautiful. She swept up a 
the Beresina, trailing wondrous dra- 
peries of vivid green. Her feet touched 
the snow-hardened ground, and armies 
of little white and blue flowers sprang 
up in her footsteps. Soft breezes 
escorted her, velvety breezes that 
carried the aromas of the far-off places 
from which they came, places far to 
the southward, and more distant 
towns beyond the Black Sea, whose w 
people were not under the sway of 
the great Czar. 
The father of Big Ivan, who had 
fought under Prince Menshikov at 
Alma fifty-five years before, hobbled 
out to see the sunbeams eat up the 
snow hummocks that hid in the shady 
places, and he told his son it was the 
most wonderful spring he had ever 
seen. 7 
“The little breezes are hot and 
sweet,” he said, sniffing hungrily with 
his face turned toward the south. “I 
know them, Ivan! I know them! 
They have the spice odor that I 
sniffed on the winds that came to us 
when we lay in the trenches at Bala- 
klava. Praise God for the warmth!” 
And that day the Dream came to 
Big Ivan as he plowed. It was a 
wonder dream. It sprang into his 
brain as he walked behind the plow, 
and for a few minutes he quivered as 
the big bridge quivers when the 
Beresina sends her ice squadrons to 
hammer the arches. It made his 
heart pound mightily, and his lips and 
throat became very dry. 
Big Ivan stopped at the end of the 
furrow and tried to discover what 
had brought the Dream. Where had 
it come from? Why had it clutched 
77. Balaklava, a place famous for battles in the Crimean War (1854). Its southern location (on the Black Sea) brings it near Arabia, famous for spices.

   him so suddenly? Was he the only 
man in the village to whom it had 
come? 
Like his father, he sniffed the 
sweet-smelling breezes. He thrust his 
great hands into the sunbeams. He 
reached down and plucked one of a 
bunch of white flowers that had 
sprung up overnight. 
1» was born of the breezes and the sun- 
shine and the spring flowers. It 
came from them and it had sprung 
into his mind because he was young 
and strong. He knew! It couldn’t 
come to his father, or Donkov, the 
tailor, or Poborino, the smith. They 
were old and weak, and Ivan’s dream 
was one that called for youth and 
strength. 
» “Aye, for youth and strength,” he 
muttered as he gripped the plow. 
“And I have it!” 
That evening Big Ivan of the Bridge 
spoke to his wife, Anna, a little 
woman, who had a sweet face and a 
wealth of fair hair. 
“Wife, we are going away from 
here,” he said. 
“Where are we going, Ivan?” she 
» asked. 
“Where do you think, Anna?’’ he 
said, looking down at her as she 
stood by his side. 
“To Bobruisk,” she murmured. “No.” 
“Farther?” 
“Aye, a long way farther.” 
Fear sprang into her soft eyes. 
Bobruisk was eighty-nine versts away, 
yet Ivan said they were going farther. 
““We—we are not going to Minsk?” 
she cried. 
“Aye, and beyond Minsk!” 
“Ivan, tell me!” she gasped. “Tell 
me where we are going!” 
“We are going to America.”

The Dream — 485 
“To America?” 
“Yes, to America!” 
Big Ivan of the Bridge lifted up 
his voice when he cried out the words 
“To America,” and then a sudden 
fear sprang upon him as those words 
dashed through the little window out 
into the darkness of the village 
street. Was he mad? America was 
8000 versts away! It was far across 
the ocean, a place that was only a 
name to him, a place where he knew 
no one. He wondered in the strange 
little silence that followed his words 
if the crippled son of Poborino, the 
smith, had heard him. The cripple 
would jeer at him if the night wind 
had carried the words to his ear. 
Anna remained staring-at her big 
husband for a few. minutes, then she 
sat down quietly at his side. There 
was a strange look in his big blue 
eyes, the look of a man to whom 
‘has come a vision, the look which 
came into the eyes of those shep- 
herds of Judea long, long ago. 
“What is it, Ivan?” she murmured 
softly, patting his big hand. “Tell 
me.” . 
And Big Ivan of the Bridge, slow 
of tongue, told of the Dream. To 
no one else would he have told it. 
Anna understood. She had a way 
of patting his hands and saying soft 
things when his tongue could not 
find words to express his thoughts. 
Ivan told how the Dream had come 
to him as he plowed. He told her 
how it had sprung upon him, a won- 
derful dream born of the soft breezes, 
of the sunshine, of the sweet smell of 
the upturned sod, and of’ his own 
strength. “It wouldn’t come to weak 
men,” he said, baring an arm that 
showed great snaky muscles rippling 
beneath the clear skin. “It is a 
dream that comes only to those who 
are strong and those who want—who 
want something that they haven’t 50

got.” Then in a lower voice he said, 
“What is it that we want, Anna?” 
The little wife looked out into the 
darkness with fear-filled eyes. There 
were spies even there in that little 
village on the Beresina, and it was 
dangerous to say words that might 
be construed into a reflection on the 
Government. But she answered Ivan. 
She stooped and whispered one word 
into his ear, and he slapped his thigh 
with his big hand. 
“Aye,” he cried. “That is what 
we want! You and I and millions like 
us want it, and over there, Anna, 
over there we will get it. It is the 
country where a muzhik is as good as 
a prince of the blood!” 
Anna stood up, took a small earth- 
enware jar from a side shelf, dusted 
it carefully, and placed it upon the 
mantel. From a knotted cloth about 
her neck she took a ruble and dropped 
the coin into the jar. Big Ivan 
looked at her curiously. 
“Tt is to make legs for your Dream,” 
she explained. “It is many versts to 
America, and one rides on rubles.” 
“You are a good wife,” he said. “I 
was afraid that you might laugh at 
me.” 
“It is a great dream,” she mur- 
mured. - “Come, we will go to sleep.” 
The Dream maddened Ivan during 
the days that followed. It pounded 
within his brain as he followed the 
plow. It bred a discontent that made 
him hate the little village, the 
swift-flowing Beresina, and the gray 
stretches that ran toward Mogilev. 
He wanted to be moving, but Anna 
had said that one rode on rubles, and 
tubles were hard to find. 
And in some mysterious way the 
village became aware of the secret. 
Donkov, the tailor, discovered it.

liberty!” cried Ivan angrily.     
   
    
   Donkov lived in one-half of the cot- 
tage occupied by Ivan and Anna, 
and Donkov had long ears. The 
tailor spread the news, and Poborino, 
the smith, and Yanansk, the baker, 
would jeer at Ivan as he passed. 
“When are you going to America?” 
they would ask. 
“Soon,” Ivan would answer. 
“Take us with you!” they would 
ery in chorus. 
“Tt is no place for- cowards,” Ivan 
would answer. “It is a long way, 
and only brave men can make the w 
journey.” 
“Are you brave?” the baker 
screamed one day as he went by. 
“I am brave enough to want 
“T am 
brave enough to want—” 
“Be careful! Be careful!” inter- 
rupted the smith. “A long tongue 
has given many a man a train jour- 
ney that he never expected.” 0 
That night Ivan and Anna, counted 
the rubles in the earthenware pot. 
The giant looked down at his wife 
with a gloomy face, but she smiled 
and patted his hand. 
“It is slow work,” he said. 
“We must be patient,” she an- 
swered. “You have the Dream.” 
“Aye,” he said. “I have the 
Dream.” 80 
Through the hot, languorous sum- 
mertime the Dream grew within the 
brain of Big Ivan. He saw visions 
in the smoky haze that hung above 
the Beresina. At times he would 
stand, hoe in hand, and look toward 
the west, the wonderful west into 
which the sun slipped down each 
evening like a coin dropped from the 
fingers of the dying day. 
Autumn came, and the fretful, 
- whining winds that came down from 
the north chilled the Dream. The 
winds whispered of the coming of the 
Snow King, and the river grumbled

as it listened. Big Ivan kept out of 
the way of Poborino, the smith, and 
Yanansk, the baker. The Dream 
was still with him, but autumn is a 
bad time for dreams. 
Winter came, and the Dream weak- 
ened. It was only the earthenware 
pot that kept it alive, the pot into 
which the industrious Anna put every 
coin that could be spared. Often 
Big Ivan would stare at the pot as 
he sat beside the stove. The pot 
was the cord which kept the Dream 
alive. 
“You are a good woman, Anna,” 
Ivan would say again and again. 
“Tt was you who thought of saving 
the rubles.” . 
“But it was you who dreamed,” 
2 she would answer. “Wait for. the 
spring, husband mine. Wait.” 
Jt was strange how the spring 
came to the Beresina that year. It 
sprang upon the flanks of winter be- 
fore the Ice King had given the order 
to retreat into the fastnesses of the 
north. Tt swept up the ‘river, es- 
corted by a million little breezes, and 
housewives opened their windows and 
30 peered out. with surprise upon their 
faces. A wonderful guest had come 
to them and found them unprepared. 
Big Ivan of the Bridge was fixing a 
fence in the meadow on the morning 
the Spring Maiden reached the village. 
For a little while he was not aware of 
her arrival. His mind was upon his 
work, but suddenly he discovered that 
he was hot, and he took off his over- 
4o coat. He turned to hang the coat 
upon a bush, then he sniffed the air, 
and a puzzled look came upon his 
face. He sniffed again, hurriedly, 
hungrily. He drew in great breaths 
of it, and his eyes shone with a 
strange light. It was wonderful air. 
It brought life to the Dream. It 
rose up within him, ten times more 
lusty than on the day it was born, 487 
and. his limbs trembled as he drew 
in the hot, scented breezes that breed 
the Wanderlust and shorten the long 
trails of the world. . 
Big Ivan clutched his coat and ran 
to the little cottage. He burst through 
the door, startling. Anna, who was 
busy with her housework. 
“The Spring!’ he cried. 
Spring!” . He took her arm and dragged her 
to the door. Standing together they 
sniffed the sweet breezes. In silence 
they listened to the song of the river. 
The Beresina had changed from a 
whining, fretful tune into a lilting, 
sweet song that would set the legs 
of lovers dancing. Anna pointed to “The 
_a@ green bud on a bush beside the’ 
door. 
“It came this minute,” she mur- 
moured. 
“Yes,” said Ivan. “The little 
fairies brought it there to show us 
that spring has come to stay.” 
Together they turned and walked 
to the mantel. Big Ivan took up the 
earthenware pot, carried it to the 
table, and spilled its contents upon 
the well-scrubbed boards. He counted 
‘while Anna stood beside him, her 
fingers clutching his coarse blouse. 
It was a slow business, because Ivan’s 
big blunt fingers were not used to, 
such work, but it was over at last. 
He stacked the coins into neat piles, 
then he straightened himself and 
turned to the woman at his side. 50 
“It is enough,” he said quietly. 
“We will go at once. If it was not 
enough, we would have to go because 
the Dream is upon me and I hate 
this place.” 
“As you say,” murmured Anna. 
“The wife of Littin, the butcher, will 
buy our chairs and our bed. I spoke 
to her yesterday.”

‘pot is buried,” 488 
Poborino, the smith; his crippled 
son; Yanansk, the baker; Donkov, 
the tailor, and a score of others were 
out upon the village street on the 
morning that Big Ivan and Anna 
set out. They were inclined to jeer 
at Ivan, but something upon the 
face of the giant made them afraid. 
Hand in hand the big man and his — 
wife walked down the street, their 
faces turned toward Bobruisk, Ivan 
balancing upon his head a heavy: 
trunk that no other man in the vil- 
lage could have lifted. 
At the end of the street a stripling 
with bright eyes and yellow curls 
clutched the hand of Ivan and looked 
into his face. 
“T know what is sending you,” 
cried. 
“Aye, you know,” said Ivan, look- 
ing into the eyes of the other. 
“It came to me yesterday,” 
mured the stripling. “I got it from 
the breezes. They are free; so are 
the birds and the little clouds and the 
river. I wish I could go.” 
“Keep your dream,” said Ivan 
softly. “Nurse it, for iti is the dream 
of a man.’ 
Anna, who was crying softly, 
touched the blouse of the boy. “At 
the back of our cottage, near the 
bush that bears the red berries, a 
she said. “Dig it up 
and take it home with you, and when he 
mur- 
you have a kopeck drop it in. It is 
a good pot.” 
The tripling understood. He 
stooped and kissed the hand of 
Anna, and Big Ivan patted him upon 
the back. They were brother dream- 
ers and they understood each other.

Big Ivan and Anna faced the long 
versts to Bobruisk, but they were 
not afraid of the dust devils. They 
had the Dream. It made their hearts 
light and took the weary feeling from 
their feet. They were on their way. 
America was a long, long journey, 
but they had started, and every 
verst they covered lessened the num- 
ber that lay between them and the | 
Promised Land. 
“I am glad the boy spoke to us,” 
said Anna. 
“And I am glad,” said Ivan. 
“Some day he will come and eat 
with us in America.” 
They came to Bobruisk. Holding 
hands, they walked into it late one 
afternoon. They were ecighty-nine

   about the way they should go, then 
from the corner of the street came a 
ery of “Police! and the’ twenty 
pedestrians ran in different directions. 
It was no false alarm. Mounted 
police charged down the dark thor- 
oughfare, swinging their swords as 
they rode at the scurrying men and 
women who raced for shelter. Big 
Ivan dragged Anna into a doorway, 
and toward their hiding place ran a 
young boy who, like themselves, had 
no connection with the group and 
who merely desired to get out of 
harm’s way till the storm was over. 
The boy was not quick enough to 
escape the charge. A trooper pur- 
sued him, overtook him before he 
reached the sidewalk, and knocked 
him down with a quick stroke given 
with the flat of his blade. His horse 
struck the boy with one of his hoofs 
as the Jad stumbled on his face. 
Big Ivan growled like an angry 
bear, and sprang from his~ hiding 
place. The trooper’s horse had car- 
ried him on to the sidewalk, and Ivan 
seized the bridle and flung the ani- 
mal on its haunches. The policeman 
leaned forward to strike at the giant, 
but Ivan of the Bridge gripped the 
left leg of the horseman and tore him 
from the saddle. 
The horse galloped off, leaving its 
rider lying beside the moaning boy, 
who was unlucky enough to be in a 
street where a score of students were 
holding a meeting. 
Anna dragged Ivan back into the 
i passageway. More police were charg- 
ing down the street, and their position 
was a dangerous one. 
“Ivan!” she cried, “Ivan! Re- 
member the Dream! America, Ivan! 
Americal Come this way! Quick!” 
With strong hands she dragged 
him down the passage. It opened 
into a narrow lane, and, holding each 
other’s hands, they hurried toward

the place where they had taken lodg- 50 
ings. From far off came screams 
and hoarse’ orders, curses, and the 
sound of galloping hoofs. The, Terror 
was abroad. 
Big Ivan spoke softly as they en- 
tered the little room they had taken. 
“He had a face like the boy to whom 
you gave the lucky pot,” he said. 
“Did you notice it in the moonlight 
when the trooper struck him down?” 
“Yes,” she answered. “I saw.” 
They left Bobruisk next morning. 
They rode away on a great, puffing, 
snorting train that terrified Anna. 
The engineer turned a stopcock as 
they were passing the engine, and 
screamed while Ivan nearly 
dropped the big trunk. The en- 
gineer grinned, but the giant looked 
up at him and the grin faded. Ivan 
of the Bridge was startled by the rush 
of hot steam, but he was afraid of no 
man. 
The train went roaring by little 
villages and great pasture stretches.

“May the little saints guide you. It

“No, we shall not be lonely,” Ivan 
would say. 
“Ha! you are going with friends?” 
_. “No, we have no friends, but we 
have something that keeps us from 
being lonely.””, And when Ivan would 
make that reply Anna would pat his 
10 hand, and the questioner would won- 
der if it was a charm or a holy relic 
that the bright-eyed couple possessed. 
They ran through Vilna, on through

where they saw the sea. They sat 
and stared at it for a whole day, talk- 
ing little but watching it with wide, 
wondering eyes. And they stared at 
the great ships that came rocking in 
20 from distant ports, their sides gray 
with the salt from the big combers 
which they had battled with. 
No wonder this America of ours is 
big. We draw the brave ones from 
the old lands, the brave ones whose 
dreams are like the guiding sign that 
was given to the Israelites of old— 
a pillar of cloud by day, a pillar of 
fire by night. / 
so The harbor-master spoke to Ivan 
and Anna as they watched the rest- 
less waters. 
“Where are you going, children?” 
“To America,” answered Ivan. 
“A long way. Three ships bound 
for America went down last month.” 
“Our ship will not sink,” said Ivan. “Why?” 
“Because I know it will not.” 
40 The harbor-master looked at the 
strange blue eyes of the giant, and 
spoke softly. ‘You have the eyes of 
a man who sees things,” he said. 
“There was a Norwegian sailor in the 
White Queen, who had eyes like yours, 
and he could see death.” 
“43,14. Vilna, Courland, provinces north and west of Minsk. 14, Libau,a Russian seaport on the Baltic Sea. 27, Israelites, ete., see Ezodus xiil, 21-22, MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
“T see life!’ said Ivan boldly. “A 
free life—’ . 
“Hush!” said the harbor-master. 
“Do not speak so loud.” He walked 
swiftly away, but he dropped a ruble 
into Anna’s hand as le passed her by. 
“For luck,” he murmured. “May 
the little saints look after you on the 
big waters.” 
They boarded the ship, and the 
Dream gave them a courage that sur- 
prised them. ‘There were others going ) 
aboard, and Ivan and Anna felt that 
those others were also persons who a 
possessed dreams. She saw the dreams 
in their eyes. There were Slavs, Poles, 
Letts, Jews, and Livonians, all bound 
for the land where dreams come true. 
They were a little afraid—-not two 
per cent of them had ever seen a ship 
before—yet their dreams gave them 
courage. 
The emigrant ship was dragged 
from her pier by a grunting tug and 7 
went floundering down the Baltic Sea. 
Night came down, and the devils who, 
according to the Esthonian fishermen, 
live in the bottom of the Baltic, got 
their shoulders under the stern of the 
ship and tried to stand her on her 
head. They whipped up white comb- 
ers that sprang on her flanks and tried 
to crush her, and the wind played a 
devil’s Jament in her rigging. Anna 
Jay sick in the stuffy women’s quar- 
ters, and Ivan could not get near her. 
But he sent her messages. He told 
her not to mind the sea devils, to 
think of the Dream, the Great Dream 
that would become real in the land 
to which they were bound. Ivan of 
the Bridge grew to full stature on 
that first night out from Libau. The 
battered old craft that carried him 
slouched before the waves that swept 
over her decks, but he was not afraid. 
Down among the million and one 
smells of the steerage he induced a 
thin-faced Livonian to play upon a

    mouth organ, and Big Ivan sang 
Paleer’s “Song of Freedom”’ in a voice 
that drowned the creaking of the old 
vessel’s timbers, and made the seasick 
ones forget their sickness. They -sat 
up in their berths and joined in the 
chorus, their eyes shining brightly in 
the half gloom: 
Freedom for serf and for slave, 
10 Freedom for all men who crave 
Their right to be free 
And who hate to bend knee 
But to Him who this right to them gave. 
It was. well that these emigrants 
had dreams. They wanted them. 
The sea devils chased the lumbering 
steamer. They hung to her bows 
and pulled her for’ard deck under 
emerald-green rollers. They clung to 
oo her stern and hoisted her nose till Big 
Ivan thought that he could touch the 
door of heaven by standing ‘on her 
blunt snout. Miserable, cold, ill, and 
sleepless, the emigrants crouched in 
their quarters, and to them Ivan and 
the thin-faced Livonian sang the 
“Song of Freedom.” 
The emigrant ship pounded through 
the Cattegat, swung southward 
through the Skagerrack and the bleak 
North Sea. But the storm pursued 
her. The big waves snarled and bit 
at her, and the captain and the chief 
officer consulted with each other. 
01 They decided to run into the Thames, 
and the harried steamer nosed her 
way in and anchored off Gravesend. 
An examination was made, and the 
agents decided to transship the emi- 
grants. They were taken to London 
and thence by train to Liverpool, and 
Ivan and Anna sat again side by side, 
holding hands and smiling at each

- said the giant.. 491 
“You are not afraid?” Ivan would 
say to her each time she looked at 
him. : 
“Tt is a long way, but the Dream 
has given me much courage,” she said. 
.“Today I- spoke to a Lett whose 
brother works in New York City,” 
“Do you know how 
much money he earns each day?” 
“How much?” she questioned. 
“Three rubles, and he calls the 
policemen by their first names.” 
“You will earn five rubles, my 
Ivan,” she murmured. “There is no 
one as strong as you.” 
Once again they were herded into 
the bowels of a big ship that steamed 
away through the fog banks of the 
Mersey out into the Irish Sea. There 
were more dreamers now, nine hun- 
dred of them, and Anna and Ivan 
were more comfortable. And. these 
new emigrants, English, Irish, Scotch, 
French, and German, knew much 
concerning America. Ivan was cer- 
tain that he would earn at least three 
tubles a day. He was very strong. 
On, the deck he defeated all comers 
in a tug of war, and the captain of 
the ship came up to him and felt his 
mouscles. 
“The country that lets men like 
you get away from it is run badly,” 
he said. “Why did you leave it?” 
The interpreter translated what the 
captain said, and through the inter- 
preter Ivan answered. 
“Thad a Dream,” he said, “a Dream 
of freedom.” 
“Good,” cried the captain. “Why 
should a man with muscles like yours 
have his face ground into the dust?” * 
The soul of Big Ivan grew during 
those days. He felt himself a man, 
a man who was born upright to speak 
his thoughts without fear. 
The ship rolled into Queenstown 
66. Mersey, a river in western England.

one bright morning, and Ivan and 
his nine hundred steerage companions 
crowded the for’ard deck. A boy in 
a rowboat threw a line to the deck, 
and after it had been fastened to a 
stanchion he came up hand over 
hand. The emigrants watched him 
curiously. An old woman sitting in 
the boat pulled off her shoes, sat in 
a loop of the rope, and lifted her 
hand as a signal to her son on deck. 
“Hey, fellers,” said the boy, “help ~ 
me pull me muvver up. She wants 
to sell a few dozen apples, an’ they 
won’t let her up the gangway!”” 
Big Ivan didn’t understand the 
words, but he guessed what the boy 
wanted. He made one of a half 
dozen who gripped the’ rope and 
started to pull the ancient apple 
woman to the deck. They had her 
halfway up the side when an under- 
sized third officer discovered what 
they weredoing. He called to a stew- 
ard, and the steward sprang to obey. 
“Turn a hose on her!” cried the 
officer. “Turn a hose on the old 
woman!” . 
The steward rushed for the hose. 
He ran with it to the side of the ship 
with the intention of squirting on the 
old woman, who was swinging in 
mid-air and exhorting the six men 
who were dragging her to the deck. 
“Pull!” she cried. “Sure, I'll give 
every one of ye a rosy red apple an’ 
me blessing with it.” 
The steward aimed the muzzle of 
the hose, and Big Ivan of the Bridge 
let go of the rope and sprang at him. 
The fist of the great Russian went 
out like a battering ram; it struck 
the steward between the eyes, and he 
dropped upon the deck. ‘He lay like 
one dead, the muzzle of the hose 
wriggling from his limp hands. 
The third officer and the inter- 
preter rushed at Big Ivan, who stood 
erect, his hands clenched. MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
“Ask the big swine why he did it,” » 
roared the officer. 
“Because he is a coward!’ cried 
Ivan. “They wouldn’t do that in 
America!” 
“What does the big brute know 
about America?” cried the officer. 
“Tell him I have dreamed of it,” 
shouted Ivan. “Tell him it is in my 
Dream. Tell him I will kill him if 
he turns the water on this old woman.” # 
The apple seller was on deck then, 
and with the wisdom of the Celt she 
understood. She put her lean hand 
upon the great head of the Russian 
and blessed him in Gaelic. Ivan 
bowed before her, then as she offered 
him a rosy apple he led her toward 
Anna, a great Viking leading a with- 
ered old woman who walked with the 
grace of a duchess. : 70 
“Please don’t touch him,” she 
cried, turning to the officer. “We 
have been waiting for your ship for 
six hours, and we have only five 
dozen apples to sell. It’s a great 
man he is. Sure he’s as big as Finn 
MacCool.” 
Someone pulled the steward behind 
a ventilator and revived him b 
squirting him with water from th 
hose which he had tried to turn upo 
the old woman. The _ third office 
slipped quietly away. 
The Atlantic was kind to the ship 
that carried Ivan and Anna. Through 
sunny days they sat up on deck and 
watched the horizon. They wanted 
to be among those who would get the 
first glimpse of the wonderland. 
They saw it on a morning with 
sunshine and soft wind. Standing 
together in the bow, they looked at 
the smear upon the horizon, and 
their eyes filled with tears. They 
forgot the long road to Bobruiisk,

“For freedom,” answered Ivan. 
“For freedom to stretch my legs and

Tvan and Anna left the Government 
ferryboat at The Battery. They 
started to walk uptown, making for 
the East Side, Ivan carrying the big 
trunk that no other man could lift. 
It was a wonderful morning. The 
city was bathed in warm sunshine, 
and the well-dressed men and women 
who crowded the sidewalks made the 
two immigrants think that it was a 
festival day. Ivan and Anna stared 
at each other in amazement. They 
had never seen such dresses as those 
worn by the smiling women who passed 
them by; they had never seen such 
well-groomed men. 
“It is a feast day. for certain,” said 
Anna. 
-“They are dressed like princes and 
princesses,” murmured Ivan. ‘There 
are no poor here, Anna. None.” 
Like two simple children, they 
walked along the streets of the City

to the gray, stupid towns where the

Terror waited to spring upon the 
cowed people. In Bobruisk, Minsk, 
Vilna, and Libau the people were 50 
sullen and ‘afraid. They walked in 
.dread, but in the City of Wonder 
beside the glorious Hudson every per- 
son seemed happy and contented. 
They lost their way, but they walked 
on, looking at the wonderful shop win- 
dows, the roaring elevated trains, and 
_the huge skyscrapers. Hours after- 
wards they found themselves in Fifth 
Avenue near Thirty-third Street, and co 
there the miracle happened to the two 
It was a big 
miracle inasmuch as it proved the

Ivan and Anna attempted to cross 
the avenue, but they became con- 
fused in the snarl of traffic. They 
dodged backward and forward as the 
stream of automobiles swept by them. ~ 
Anna screamed, and, in response to 70 
her scream, a traffic policeman, re- 
splendent in a new uniform, rushed 
to her side. He took the arm of 
Anna and flung up a commanding 
hand. The charging autos halted. 
For five blocks north and south they 
jammed on the brakes when the un- 
expected interruption occurred, and 
Big Ivan gasped. 
“Don’t be flurried, little woman,”’ so 
said the cop. “I can tame ’em by 
liftin’ my hand.” 
Anna didn’t understand what he 
said, but she knew it was something 
nice by the manner in which his 
eyes smiled down upon her. And in 
front of the waiting automobiles he 
led her with the same care that he 
would give to a duchess, while Ivan, 
carrying the big trunk, followed them, 90 
wondering much. Ivan’s mind went 
back to Bobruisk on the night the 
Terror was abroad. 
The policeman led Anna to the 
sidewalk, patted Ivan good-naturedly 
upon the shoulder, and then with a

sharp whistle unloosed the waiting 
stream of cars that had been held up 
so that two Russian immigrants could 
cross the avenue. 
Big Ivan of the Bridge took the 
trunk from his head and put it on 
the ground. He reached out his arms 
and folded Anna in a great embrace. 
His eyes were wet. 
“The Dream is true!’ he cried. 
“Did you see, Anna? We are as 
good as they! 
a muzhik is as good as a prince of 
the blood!” 
The President was nearing the 
close of his address. Anna shook 
Ivan, and Ivan came out of the trance 
which the President’s words had 
brought upon him. He sat up and 
listened intently: 
We grow great by dreams. All big 
men are dreamers. They sce things in 
the soft haze of a spring day or in the

Some of us let those great dreams die, 
but others nourish and protect them, 
nurse them: through bad days till they 
bring them to the sunshine and light 
which come always to those who sin- 
cerely hope that their dreams will come 
true. 
The President finished. For a mo- 
ment he stood looking down at the 
faces turned up to him, and Big Ivan 
of the Bridge thought that the Presi- 
dent smiled at him. Ivan seized 
Anna’s hand and held it tight. 
“He knew of my Dream!” he cried. 
“He knew of it. Did you hear what 
he said about the dreams of a spring day?” 
“Of course he knew,” said Anna. 
“He is the wisest man in America, 
where there are many wise men. 
Ivan, you are a citizen now.” 
“And you are a citizen, Anna.” 
The band started to play “My This is the land where’ MAN AND HIS FELLOWS

and Anna got to their feet. Standing 
side by side, holding hands, ‘they « 
joined in with the others who had

the blessed land where dreams come 
true.

AMERICANS OF FOREIGN BIRTH 
Wooprow WIiison 
It warms my heart that you should 
give me such a reception; but it is not 
of myself that I wish to think tonight, 
but of those who have just become 
citizens of the United States. 
This is the only country in the 
world which experiences this constant 
and repeated rebirth. Other countries 
depend upon the multiplication of their 
own native people. This country is 
constantly drinking strength out of 
new sources by the voluntary associa- 
tion with it of great bodies of strong 
men and forward-looking women out .

of other lands. And so by the gift of 
_the free will of independent people it 
is being constantly renewed from- 
generation to generation by the same 
process by which it was originally 
created.. It is as if humanity had 
determined to see to it that this great 
Nation, founded for the benefit of 
humanity, should not lack for the 
10 allegiance of the people of the world. 
You have just taken an oath of 
allegiance to the United States. Of 
allegiance to whom? Of allegiance to 
no one, unless it be God—certainly not 
of allegiance to those who temporarily 
represent this great Government. You 
have taken an oath of allegiance to a 
great ideal, to a great body of princi- 
ples, to a great hope of the human 
2% race. You have said, “We are going 
to America not only to earn a living, 
not only to seek the things which it 
was more difficult to obtain. where we 
were born, but to help forward the 
great enterprises of the human spirit— 
to let men know that everywhere in 
the world there are men who will 
cross strange oceans and go where a 
speech is spoken which is alien to them 
so if they can but satisfy their quest for 
what their spirits crave; knowing that 
whatever the speech, there is but one. 
longing and utterance of the human 
heart, and that is for liberty and 
justice.” And while you bring all 
countries with you, you come with a 
purpose of leaving all other countries 
behind you—bringing what is best of 
their spirit, but not looking over your 
shoulders and seeking to perpetuate 
what you intend to leave behind in 
them. I certainly would not be one 
even to suggest that a man cease to 
love the home of his birth and the 
nation of his origin—these things are 
very sacred and ought not to be put 
out of our hearts—but it is one thing 
to love the place where you were born 
and it is another thing to dedicate yourself to the place to which you s 
go. You cannot dedicate yourself to 
America unless you become in every 
respect and with every purpose of your

not become thorough Americans if 
‘you think of yourselves in groups. 
America does not consist of groups. 
A man who thinks of himself as belong- 
ing to a particular national group in 
America has not yet become an 60 
American, and. the man who goes 
among you to ‘trade upon your 
nationality is no worthy son to live 
under the Stars and Stripes. . 
My urgent advice to you would be, 
not only always to think first of 
America, but always, also, to think 
first of humanity. You do not love 
humanity if you seek to divide human- 
ity into jealous camps. Humanity can 70 
be welded together only by love, by 
sympathy, by justice, not by jealousy 
and hatred. I am sorry for the man 
who seeks to make personal capital 
out of the passions-of his fellow-men. 
He has lost the touch and ideal of 
America, for America was created to 
unite mankind by those passions which 
lift, and not by the passions which 
separate and debase. We came to 80 
America, either ourselves or in the 
persons of our ancestors, to better the 
ideals of men, to make them see finer 
things than they had seen before, to 
get rid of the things that divide and 
to make sure of the things that unite. 
It was but an historical accident no 
doubt, that this great country was 
called the “United States”; yet I am 
very thankful that it has that word 90 
“United” in its title, and the man who 
seeks to divide man from man, group 
from group, interest from interest in 
this great Union is striking at its very 
heart. . 
It is a very interesting circumstance 
to me, in thinking of those of you who 
have just sworn allegiance to this

great. Government, that you were 
drawn across the ocean by some 
beckoning finger of hope, by some 
belief, by some vision of a new kind of 
justice, by some expectation of a 
better kind of life. No doubt you 
have been disappointed in some of us. 
Some of us are very disappointing. 
No doubt you have found that justice 
in the United States goes only with a 
pure heart and a right purpose as it 
does everywhere else in the world. 
No doubt what you found here did 
not seem touched for you, after all, 
with the complete beauty of the ideal 
which you had conceived beforehand. 
But remember this: If we had grown 
at all poor in the ideal, you had 
brought some of it with you. A man 
does not go out to seek the thing that . 
is not in him. A man does not hope 
for the thing that he does not believe 
in, and if some of us have forgotten 
what America believed in, you, at any 
tate, imported in your own hearts a 
renewal. of the belief. That is the 
reason that I, for one, make you 
welcome. If I have in any degree 
forgotten what America was intended 
for, I will thank God if you will re- 
mind me. I was born in America. You 
dreamed dreams of what America was 
to be, and I hope you brought the 
dreams with you. No man that does 
not see visions will ever realize any 
high hope or undertake any high enter- 
prise. Just because you brought 
dreams with you, America is more like- created to unite mankind.” MAN AND HIS FELLOWS

LINCOLN, THE LAWYER* 
Ipa M. TarBetn 
When, in 1849, Lincoln decided to 
abandon politics finally and to devote 
himself to the law, he had been prac- 
ticing for thirteen years. In spite of 
the many interruptions electioneering 
and office-holding had caused, he was 
well-established. Rejoining his part- 
ner Herndon—the firm of Lincoln and 
Herndon had been only a name during 
Lincoln’s term in Washington—he 
took up the law with a singleness of 
‘purpose which had never before char- 
acterized his practice. 
Lincoln’s headquarters were in 
Springfield, but his practice was itin- 
erant. The arrangements for the 
administration of justice in Illinois 
in the early days were suited-to the 
conditions of the country, the state 
being divided into judicial circuits in- 
cluding more or less territory ac-

circuit a judge was appointed, who 
each spring and fall traveled. from 
county-seat to county-seat to hold 
court. With the judge traveled a 
certain number of the best-known 
lawyers of the district. Each lawyer 
had, of course, a permanent office in 
one of the county-seats, and often at 
several of the others he had partners, 
usually young men of little experience, 
for whom he acted ‘as counsel in 
special cases. This peripatetic court 
prevailed in Tlinois until the begin- 
ning of the fifties; but for many years 
after, when the towns had grown so 
large that a clever lawyer might have 
enough to do in his own county, a few 
lawyers, Lincoln among them,- who 
from long association felt that the 
circuit was their natural habitat, re- 
fused to leave it. 
The circuit which Lincoln traveled 
was known as the “Eighth Judicial 
Circuit.” “It included fifteen counties 
in 1845, though the territory has since 
been divided into more. It was about 
one hundred and fifty miles long by as 
many broad. There were no railroads 
in the Eighth Circuit until about 1845, 
and the court traveled on horseback 
or in carriages. Lincoln had no horse 
in the early days of his practice. It 
was his habit then to borrow one, or 
to join a company of a half dozen or 
more in hiring a “three-seated spring 
wagon.” Later he owned a turn-out 
of his own, which figures in nearly all 
the traditions of the Eighth Circuit; 
the horse being described as “poky” 
and the buggy as “rattling.” 
There was much that was irritating 
and uncomfortable in the circuit- 
riding of the Illinois court, but there 
was more which was amusing to a 
temperament like Lincoln’s. The free- 
dom, the long days in the open air, 
the unexpected, if trivial, adventures, 
the meeting with wayfarers and set- 
tlers—all was an entertainment to him. MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
He found humor and human interest » 
on the route, where his companions 
saw nothing but commonplaces. “He 
saw the ludicrous in an assemblage of 
fowls,” says H. C. Whitney, one of 
his fellow-itinerants, “in a man spad- 
ing his garden, in a clothes-line full 
of clothes, in a group of boys, in a 
lot of pigs rooting at a mill door, in a 
mother duck teaching her brood to 
swim—in everything and anything.” 60 
The sympathetic observations of these 
long rides furnished humorous set- 
tings for some of his best stories. If 
frequently on these trips he fell into 
somber reveries and rode with head 
bent, ignoring his companions, general- 
ly he took part in all the frolicking 
which went on, joining in practical 
jokes, singing noisily with the rest, 
sometimes even playing a jew’s-harp. 7 
When the county-seat was reached, 
the bench and bar quickly settled 
themselves in the town tavern. It 
was usually a large two-story house 
with big rooms and long verandas. 
There was little exclusiveness possible 
in these hostelries. Ordinarily judge 
and lawyer slept two in a bed, and 
three or four beds in a room. They 
ate at the common table with jurors, 
witnesses, prisoners out on bail, trav- 
eling peddlers, teamsters, and laborers. 
The only attempt at classification on 
the landlord’s part was seating the 
lawyers in a group at the head of the 
table. Most of them accepted this 
distinction complacently. Lincoln, 
however, seemed to be indifferent to 
it. One day, when he had come in 
and seated himself at the foot with the 
“fourth estate,” the landlord called to 
him, “You’re in the wrong place, 
Mr. Lincoln; come up here.” . 
“lave you anything better to eat 
up there, Joe?” he inquired quizzically; 
. “if not, I'll stay here.” 
The accommodations of the taverns 
were often unsatisfactory—the food]

_ LINCOLN, THE LAWYER 
poorly cooked, the beds hard: Lin- 
coln accepted everything with un- 
complaining good nature, though his 
companions habitually growled at the 
hardships of the life. It was not only 
repugnance to criticism which might 
hurt others, it was the indifference of 
one whose thoughts were always busy 
with problems apart from physical 
comfort, who had little notion of the 
so-called “refinements of life,” and 
almost no sense of luxury and ease. 
The judge naturally was the leading 
character in these nomadic groups. 
He received all the special considera- 
tion the democratic spirit of the in- 
habitants bestowed on anyone, and 
controlled his privacy and his time to 
a degree. Judge David Davis, who 
from 1848 presided over the Eighth 
Circuit as long as Mr. Lincoln trav- 
eled it, was a man of unusual force of 
character, of large learning, quick im- 
pulses, and strong prejudices. Lin- 
coln was from the beginning of their 
association a favorite with Judge 
Davis. Unless he joined the circle 
which the judge formed in his room 
after supper, his honor was impatient 
and distraught, interrupting the con- 
versation constantly by demanding: 
“Where’s Lincoln?” “Why don’t Lin- 
coln come?” And when Lincoln did 
come, the judge would draw out story 
after story, quieting everybody who 
interrupted with an impatient, “Mr. 
Lincoln’s talking.”’ If anyone came 
to the door to see the host in the midst 
of one of Lincoln’s stories he would 
send.a lawyer into the hall to see what 
was wanted, and, as soon as the door 
closed, order Lincoln to “go ahead.” 
The appearance of the court in a 
town was invariably a stimulus to its 
social life. In all of the county-seats 
there were a few fine homes of which 
the dignity, spaciousness, and elegance 
still impress the traveler through 
Illinois. The hospitality of these 501 
houses was generous. Dinners, re- 
ceptions, and suppers followed one 
another as soon as the court began. 
Lincoln was a favorite figure at all 
these gatherings. ‘ 
His favorite field, however, was the 
court. The courthouses of Tlinois in 
which he practiced were not log- 
houses, as has been frequently taken 
for granted. “It is not probable,” 
says a leading member of the Illinois 
bar, “Mr. Lincoln ever saw a log 
courthouse in central Illinois, where 
he practiced law, unless he saw one 
at Decatur, in Macon County. In a 
conversation between three members 
of the Supreme Court of Illinois, all 
of whom had been born in this state 
and: had lived in it all their lives, and who were certainly familiar with the 
central portions of the state, all de- 
clared they had never seen a log 
courthouse in the state.” 
The courthouses in which Lincoln 
practiced were stiff, old-fashioned 
wood or brick structures, usually 
capped by cupola or tower, and fronted 
by verandas with huge Doric or Ionic 
pillars. They were finished inside in 
the most uncompromising style-—-hard, 
white walls, unpainted woodwork, 
pine floors, Wooden benches. Usually 
they were heated by huge Franklin 
stoves, with yards of stove-pipe run- 50 
° 
ning wildly through the air, searching . 
for an exit, and threatening momen- 
tarily to unjoint and tumble in sec- 
tions. Few of the lawyers had offices 
in the town; and a corner of the court- 
room, the shade of a tree in the court- 
yard, a sunny side of a building, were 
where they. met their clients and 
transacted business. 
In the courts themselves there was 
a certain indifference to formality 
engendered by the primitive sur- 
roundings, which, however, the judges 
never allowed to interfere with the 
seriousness of the work. Lincoln ha-  
-P-A-G-E-511

o 502 
bitually, when not busy, whispered 
stories to his neighbors, frequently to 
the annoyance of Judge Davis. If 
Lincoln persisted too long, the judge 
would rap on the chair and exclaim: 
“Come, come, Mr. Lincoln, I can’t 
stand this! -There is no use trying to 
carry on two courts; I must adjourn 
mine or you yours, and I think you 
will have to be the one.” As soon 
as the group had scattered, the judge 
would call one of the men to him and 
ask: “What was that Lincoln was 
telling?” 
“I was never fined but once for 
contempt of court,” says one of the 
clerks of the court in Lincoln’s day. 
“Davis fined me five dollars. Mr. 
Lincoln had just come in, and leaning 
over my desk had told me a story so 
irresistibly funny that I broke out 
into a loud laugh. The judge called 
me to order in haste, saying, “This 
must ‘be stopped! Mr. Lincoln, you 
are constantly disturbing this court 
with your stories.’ Then to me, ‘You 
may fine yourself five dollars for your 
disturbance.’ I apologized, but told 
the judge that the story was worth 
the money. In a few minutes the 
judge called me to him. ‘What was 
the story Lincoln told you?’ he 
asked. I told him, and he laughed 
aloud in spite of himself. ‘Remit 
~ your fine,’ he ordered.” 
The partiality of Judge Davis for 
Lincoln was shared by the members 
of the court generally. The unaffected 
friendliness and helpfulness of his 
nature had more to do with this than 
his wit and cleverness. If there was 
a new clerk in court, a stranger unused 
to the ways of the place, Lincoln was 
the first—sometimes the only one—to 
shake hands with him and congratulate 
him on his election. 
“No lawyer on the circuit was more 
unassuming than was Mr. Lincoln,” 
says one who practiced with him. MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
“He arrogated to himself no su 
periority over anyone—not even th 
most obscure member of the bar. H 
treated everyone with that simplicit; 
and kindness that friendly neighbor 
manifest in their relations with on 
another. He was remarkably gentle 
with young lawyers becoming per- 
manent residents at the several county- 
seats in the circuit: where he had 
practiced for so many years..... 
The result was, he became the much- 
loved senior member of the bar. No 
young lawyer ever practiced in the 
courts with Mr. Lincoln who did not 
in all his after life have a regard for 
him akin to personal affection.” 
“I remember with what confidence 
I always went to him,” says Judge 
Lawrence Welden, who first knew 
Lincoln at the bar in 1854, “because 70 
I was certain he knew all about the 
matter and would most cheerfully 
help me. I can see him now, through 
the decaying memories of thirty years, 
standing in the corner of the old court- 
room; and as I approached him with a 
paper I did not understand, he said, 
‘Wait until I fix this plug of my 
“gallis” and I will pitch into that like 
a dog at a root.’ While speaking he s 
was busily engaged in trying to con- 
nect his suspenders with his pants 
by making a plug perform the function 
of a button.” . 
If for any reason Lincoln was absent 
from court, he was missed perhaps as 
no other man on the Eighth Circuit 
would have been, and his return 
greeted joyously. He was not less 
happy himself -to rejoin his friends. ; 
“‘Ain’t you glad I’ve come?” he would 
call out, as he came up to shake hands. 
The cases which fell to Lincoln on 
the Eighth Circuit were of the sort 
common to a new country. Litiga- 
tion over bordering lines and deeds, 
over damages by wandering cattle, 
over broils at country festivities. Few 60
-P-A-G-E-512
) LINCOLN, THE LAWYER 
of the cases were of large importance. 
When a client came to Lincoln his 
first effort was to arrange matters, if 
possible, and to avoid asuit. Inafew 
notes for a law lecture prepared about 
1850, he says: 
“Discourage litigation. Persuade 
your neighbors to compromise when- 
ever youcan. Point out to them how. 
1 the nominal winner is often a real 
loser—in fees, expenses, and waste 
of time. As a peacemaker the lawyer 
has a superior opportunity of being a 
good man. There will still be business 
enough. 
“Never stir up litigation. A worse 
man can scarcely be found than one 
who does this. Who can be more 
nearly a fiend than he who habitually 
%” overhauls the register of deeds in 
search of defects in titles, whereon to 
stir up strife, and put money in his 
pocket? A moral tone ought to be 
infused into the profession which 
should drive such men out of it.” 
He carried out this in his practice. 
“Who was your guardian?” he asked a 
young man who came to him to com- 
plain that a part of the property left 
whim had been withheld. “Enoch 
Kingsbury,” replied the young man. 
“TI know Mr. Kingsbury,” said Lin- 
eoln, “ard he is not the man to have 
cheated you out of a cent, and I can’t 
take the case, and advise you to drop 
the subject.” And it was dropped. 
“We shall not take your case,” he 
said to a man who had shown that by’a 
legal technicality he could win prop- 
erty worth six hundred dollars. “You 
must remember that some things 
legally right are not morally right. 
' We shall not take your case, but will 
give you a little advice for which we 
will charge you nothing. You seem 
to be a sprightly, energetic man; 
we would advise you to try your hand 
at making six hundred dollars in some 
other way.” 503 
Where he saw injustice he was 50 
quick to offer his services’ to the 
wronged party. A pleasant example 
of this is related by Joseph Jefferson 
in his Autobiography. In 1839 Jeffer- 
son, then a, lad of ten years, traveled 
through Illinois with his father’s 
theatrical company. After playing 
at Chicago, Quincy, Peoria, and Pe- 
kin, the company went in the fall to 
Springfield, where the sight of the co 
legislature tempted the elder Jefferson

the season. But there was no theater.

But hardly had they completed it 
before a religious revival broke out 
in the town, and the church people 
tured all their influence against the 
theater. So effectually did they work 
that a law was passed by the munici- 70 ~ 
pality imposing a license which was 
practically prohibitory. ‘In the midst 
of our trouble,” says Jefferson, “a 
young lawyer called on the managers.

in his hands, to have the license taken.

The young lawyer began his harangue. 
He handled the subject with tact,

of the drama from the time when 
Thespis acted in a cart to the stage

the council in a roar of laughter. His

LINCOLN, THE MAN OF THE 
PEOPLE — 
Epwin Marxuam 
When the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind 
Hour : : 
Greatening and darkening as it hurried on, 
She left the Heaven of Heroes and came 
down 
Tomake a man to meet the mortal need. 4 
She took the tried clay of the common road, 
Clay warm yet with the genial heat of 
Earth, 
Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy, 
Tempered the heap with thrill of human 
tears, 
Then mixed a laughter with the serious 
stuff. 
Into the shape she breathed a flame to light 
That tender, tragic, ever-changing face, 11 
And laid on him a sense of the Mystic 
Powers, 
Moving—all hushed—behind the mortal 
veil. 
Here was a man to hold against the world, 
Aman to match the mountains and the sea. 
The color of the ground was in him, the red 
earth, 16 
The smack and tang of elemental things; 
The rectitude and patience of the cliff; 
The good-will of the rain that loves all 
leaves; 
The friendly welcome of the wayside well; MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
The courage of the bird that dares the sea; 
The gladness of the wind that shakes the 
corn; 22 
The pity of the snow that hides all scars; 
The secrecy of streams that make their way 
Under the mountain to the rifted rock; .25 
The tolerance and equity of light 
That gives as freely to the shrinking flower 
As to the great oak flaring to the wind— 
To the grave’s low hill as to the Matterhorn 
That shoulders out the sky. Sprung from 
the West, 30 
He drank the valorous youth of a new 
world. 
The strength of virgin forests braced his 
mind, 
The hush of spacious prairies stilled his 
soul. 
His words were oaks in acorns; and his 
thoughts 
Were roots that firmly gripped the granite 
truth. 35 
Up from log cabin to the Capitol, 
One fire was on his spirit, one resolve— 
To send the keen ax to the root of wrong, 
Clearing a free way for the feet of God, 
The eyes of conscience testing every stroke, 
To make his deed the measure of aman. 41 
He built the rail-pile as he built the State, 
Pouring his splendid strength through 
every blow: 
The grip that swung the ax in Illinois 
Was on the pen that set a people free. 45 
So came the Captain with the mighty 
heart; 
And when the judgment thunders split the 
house, . . 
Wrenching the rafters from their ancient 
rest, 
He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again 
The rafters of the Home. He held his 
place— 50 
Held the long purpose like a growing tree— 
Held on through blame and faltered not at 
praise. 
And when he fell in whirlwind, he went

Goes down with a great shout upon the

And hears a lonesome place against the

in the long run each section is going to 
find that its welfare, instead of being 
antagonistic to, is indissolubly bound 
up in, the welfare of other sections; 
and the growth of means of communi- 
cation, the growth of education in its

growth in the sense of solidarity

of patriotic pride of each American in 
the deeds of all other Americans—of 
pride in the past history and present 
and future greatness of the whole

nothing to us whether the regiments 
come from Oregon, Idaho, California, 
Nebraska, Pennsylvania, or Tennes- 
see. What does matter is that these 
splendid soldiers are all Americans; 
that they are our heroes; that our 
blood runs in their veins; that the flag 
under which we live is the flag for 
which they have fought, for which 
some of them have died. ~ 
Danger from religious antipathy is 
dead, and from sectional antipathy 
dying; but there are at times very ugly 
manifestations of antipathy between 
class and class. It seems a pity to have 
to use the word “class,” because there 
are really no classes in our American 
life in the sense in which the word 
“class” is used in Europe. Our social 
and political systems do not admit of 
them in theory, and in practice they 
exist only in a very fluid state. In 
most European countries classes are 
separated by rigid boundaries, which 
can be crossed but rarely, and with the 
utmost difficulty and peril. Here the 
boundaries cannot properly be said to 
exist, and are certainly so fluctuating 
and evasive, so indistinctly marked, 
that they cannot be appreciated when 
seen near.by. Any American family 
which lasts a few generations will be 
apt to have representatives in all the 
different classes. The great business 
men, even the great professional men, 
and especially the great statesmen 
and sailors and soldiers, are very apt 
to spring from among the farmers or 
wage-workers, and their kinsfolk re- 
main near the old home or at the old 
trade. If ever there existed in the 
world a community where the identity 
of interest, of habit, af principle, and 
of ideals should be felt as a living 
force, ours is the one. Speaking gen- 
erally, it really is felt to a degree quite 
unknown in other countries of our 
size. There are, doubtless, portions 
of Norway and Switzerland where the 50

pioned, and less familiar with the re- 
mainder. In other words, I had grown 
into sympathy with, into understand- 
ing of, group after group, with the 
effect that I invariably found that 
they and I had common purposes and 
a common standpoint. We differed 
among ourselves, or agreed among 
ourselves, not because we had different 
occupations or the same occupation, 
but because of our ways of looking at 
life. . 
It is this capacity for sympathy, for 
fellow-feeling and mutual understand- 
ing, which must lie at the basis of all 
really successful movements for good 
government and the betterment of 
social and civic conditions. There is 
no patent device for bringing about 
good government. Still less is there 
any patent device for remedying social 
evils and doing away with social in- 
equalities. Wise legislation can help 
in each case, and crude, vicious, or 
demagogie legislation can do. an in- 
finity of harm. But the betterment 
must come through the slow workings 
of the same forces which always have 
tended for righteousness, and always 
will. 
The prime lesson to be taught is the 
lesson of treating each man on his 
worth as a man, and of remembering 
that while sometimes it is necessary, 
from both a legislative and social 
standpoint, to consider men as a class, 
yet in the long run our safety lies in 
recognizing the individual’s worth or 
lack of worth as the chief basis of 
action, and in shaping our whole con- 
duct, and especially our political con- 
duct, accordingly. It is impossible for 
a democracy to endure if the political 
lines are drawn to coincide with class 
lines. The resulting government, 
whether of the upper or the lower 
class, is not a government of the whole 
people, but a government of part of the 
people at the expense of the rest. 
  MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
Where the lines of political division are » 
vertical, the men of each occupation 
and of every social standing separat- 
ing according to their vocations and 
principles, the result is healthy and 
normal. Just so far, however, as the 
lines are drawn horizontally, the result 
is unhealthy, and in the long run dis- 
astrous, for such a division means that 
men are pitted against one another in 
accordance with the blind and selfish 
interests of the moment. Each is thus 
placed over against his neighbor in an 
attitude of greedy class hostility, which 
becomes the mainspring of his con- 
duct, instead of each basing his politi- 
cal action upon his own convictions 
as to what is advisable and what in- 
advisable, and upon his own disinter- 
ested sense of devotion to the interests 
of the whole community as he sees 7 
them. Republics have fallen in the 
past primarily because the parties 
that controlled them divided along the 
lines of class, so that inevitably the 
triumph of one or the other implied 
the supremacy of a part over the 
whole. The result might be an oli- 
garchy, or it might be mob rule; it 
mattered little which, as regards the 
ultimate effect, for in both cases 9 
tyranny and anarchy were sure to 
alternate. : The failure of the Greek 
and Italian republics was fundamen- 
tally due to this cause. Switzerland 
has flourished because the divisions 
upon which her political issues have 
been fought have not been primarily 
those of mere caste or social class, and 
America will flourish and will become 
greater than any empire because, in 
the Iong run, in this country, any party 
which strives to found itself upon 
sectional or class jealousy and hos- 
tility must go down before the good 
sense of the people. 
The only way to provide against

510 
mass of our legislation and adminis- 
tration ought to be concerned with 
matters that are strictly for the com- 
monwealth; and where special legisla- 
tion or administration is needed, as 
it often must be, for a certain class, 
the need can be met primarily by mere 
honesty and common sense. But if 
men are elected solely from any caste, 
10 or on any caste theory, the voter 
gradually substitutes the theory of 
allegiance to the caste for the theory 
of allegiance to the commonwealth as 
a whole, and instead of demanding as 
fundamental the qualities of probity 
and broad intelligence——which are the 
indispensable qualities in securing the 
welfare of the whole—as the first con- 
sideration, he demands, as a substi- 
20 tute, zeal in the service, or apparent 
service, of the class, which is quite 
compatible with gross corruption out- 
side. In short, we get back to the con- 
ditions which foredoomed democracy 
to failure in the ancient Greek and 
medieval republics, where party lines 
were horizontal and class warred 
against class, each in consequence 
necessarily substituting devotion to 
30 the interest of a class for devotion to 
the interest of the state and ‘to the 
elementary ideas of morality. 
The only way to avoid the growth 
of these evils is, so far as may be, to 
help in the creation of conditions which 
‘will permit mutual understanding and 
fellow-feeling between the members of 
different classes. To do this it is ab- 
solutely necessary that there should be 
40 natural association between the mem- 
bers for a common end or with a com- 
‘mon purpose. As long as men are 
separated by their caste lines, each 
body having its own amusements, in- 
terests, and occupations, they are cer-

age man, when he has no means of : 
being brought into contact with an- 
other, or of gaining any insight into 
that other’s ideas and aspirations, 
either ignores these ideas and aspira- 
tions completely, or else feels toward 
them a more or less tepid dislike. The 
result is a complete and perhaps fatal 
misunderstanding, due primarily to 
the fact that the capacity for fellow- 
feeling is given no opportunity to 
flourish. On-the other hand, if the 
men can be mixed together in some 
way that will loosen the class or caste 
bonds and pit each on his merits as 
an individual man, there is certain 
to be a regrouping independent of 
cast lines. A tie may remain between 
- the members of a caste, based merely 
upon the similarity of their habits of 
life; but this will be much less strong 
than the ties based on identity of ' 
passion, of principle, or of ways of 
locking at life. Any man who has 
ever, for his good fortune, been 
obliged to work with men in masses, in 
some place or under some condition 
or in some association where the dis- 
location of caste was complete, must 
recognize the truth of this as apparent. 
Every mining-camp, every successful : 
volunteer regiment, proves it. In 
such cases there is always some object 
which must be attained, and the men 
interested in its attainment have to 
develop their own leaders and their 
own ties of association, while the 
would-be leader can succeed only by 
selecting for assistants the men whose 
peculiar capacities fit them to do the 
best work in the various emergencies ° 
that arise. Under such circumstances

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This selection is taken from an article 
entitled “Fellow-Feeling as a Political Factor,” 
that appeared in The Century Magazine, Janu- 
ary, 1900. 
@. Roosevelt says that there are three 
kinds of hostility that prevent men’s working 
together in a democracy—religious hostility, 
sectional hostility, and class hostility; how does 
he think the public school helps to prevent 
religious hostility? 
8. In what way did the Spanish War help 
to remove sectional hostility? This article was 
written shortly after the Spanish War; would 
Roosevelt have said the same thing about the 
World War? 
4, Which of the three things that prevent 
men’s working together does Roosevelt con- 
sider the most dangerous? What is the cure 
for it? Tell Roosevelt’s own experience as he 
gives it in this article to prove that “any 
healthy-minded American is bound to think 
well of his fellow Americans if he only gets to 
know them,” 
5. What does he think lies at the basis of all 
good government? What does he consider the 
right way to improve social and civic conditions? 
6. What is the “prime lesson’”’ to be taught? 
Roosevelt speaks of the danger of drawing class 
lines “horizontally.” By this he means dividing 
people into “upper” and “lower” classes; show 
how this is “unhealthy, and in the long run 
disastrous.” What has happened in the past 
to great republics that drew class lines hori-

RECESSIONAL—A VICTORIAN ODE 
Ropyarp Krerine 
God of our fathers, known of old— 
Lord of our far-flung battle line— 
Beneath whose awful hand we hold 
Dominion over palm and pine— - 
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 5 
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
The tumult and the shouting dies— 
The Captains and the Kings depart— 
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice, 
An humble and a contrite heart. 10 
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 
“Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
Far-called, our navies melt away— 
On dune and headland sinks the fire— 
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday 15 
Ts one with Nineveh and Tyre! 
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet, 
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose 
Wild tongues that have not Thee in 
awe— 20 
Such boasting as the Gentiles use, 
Or lesser breedg without the Law— 
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
For heathen heart that puts her trust 25 In reeking tube and iron shard— 
All valiant dust that builds on dust, 
And guarding calls not Thee to guard, 
For frantic boast and foolish word, 
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord! 
. Amen

THE TUFT OF FLOWERS 
Rosert Frost _ 
I went to turn the grass once after one 
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. 
The dew was gone that made his blade so 
keen. 
Before I came to view the leyeled scene. 
I looked for him behind an isle of trees; 5 
T listened for his whetstone on the breeze. 
But he had gone his way, the grass all 
mown, 
And I must be, as he had been—alone, 
“As all must be,” I said within my heart, 
“Whether they work together or apart.” 10 
But as I said it, swift there passed me by 
On noiseless wing a ’wildered butterfly, 
Seeking with memories grown dim o’er 
night 
Some resting flower of yesterday’s delight. 
And once I marked his flight go round and 
round, 15 
As where some flower lay withering on the 
ground. 
And then he flew as far as eye could see, 
And then on tremulous wing came back to 
me. 
I thought of questions that have no reply, 
And would have turned to toss the grass 
to dry; 20 
But he turned first, and led my eye to look 
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, 
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had 
spared 
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had-bared. 
I left my place to know them by their 
name, 25 
Finding them butterfly weed when I came. 
The mower in the dew had loved them 
thus, 
By leaving them to flourish, not for us, 
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to 
him, 
But from sheer morning gladness at the 
brim. 30 
The butterfly and I had lit upon, 
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn, ‘ MAN AND HIS FELLOWS 
That made me hear the wakening birds 
around, 
And hear his long scythe whispering to the 
ground, 
And feel a spirit kindred to my own; 35 
So that henceforth I worked no more alone; 
But glad with him, I worked as with his 
aid, : 
And weary, sought at noon with him the 
shade; . 
And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly 
speech 
With one whose thought I had not hoped 
to reach. 40 
“Men work together,” I told him from the 
heart, 
“Whether they work together or apart.” 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. This poem has been chosen to close 
Part IIL of our book because it sums up much 
of the thought that binds together the selec- 
tions you have been reading in Part III and 
looks forward to Man’s relationship to the 
world of Nature, which is the theme of Part IV. 
You should compare it specially with Whittier’s 
poem “‘Seed-Time and Harvest” (page 478). 
2. Read this poem through thoughtfully but 
without pausing over details, and then ask 
yourself what is the theme of it. The first 
part ends with the idea that men work alone, 
even if they work in company with others. 
What is the final thought? What experience 
showed the poet this truth? What do the 
Jast two lines mean? 
8. Now note that the truth about working 
together comes to the poet because of # percep- 
tion of the beauty of Nature. It was the mow- 
er’s love of beauty that reached out and in- 
fluenced the love of beauty that the poet felt. 
This interpretation of beauty, as has already 
been pointed out in the various introductions, 
is what makes literature. To put it in another 
way, the idea about codperation as a corner- 
stone of democracy may be expressed in an 
essay, or @ president’s message, or a constitu- 
tion; it may also be. felt, as a revelation of 
beauty, and set down by a poet who has just 
seen the truth from a new angle. 
4. In this case, the revelation of truth and 
beauty has come to the poet through an inspira- 
tion gained from Nature. In Part IV, this 
relationship between Man and Nature will be 
worked out more completely.

All are needed by each one, 
Nothing is fair or good alone. 
I thought the sparrow’s note from Heaven, 
Singing at dawn on the alder bough;

He sings the song, but it pleases not now; 
For I did not bring home the river and sky; 
He sang to my ear; they sang to my eye.

  AN INTRODUCTION 
. I 
Read the lines written by Ralph Waldo 
Emerson on the page facing 512. They are 
printed in a different type from that of the 
text of the book in order to show you that’ 
they are a key to the study of Part IV. 
What does the poet mean by saying, “All 
are needed by each one”? What illustra- 
tion does he give? Has Nature any part 
in the idea of brotherhood that the poem 
tells about? 
In a celebrated address, Emerson once 
said that the mind of man is formed, or 
educated, by three forces: the Mind of 
the Past; Action; and the World of 
Nature. By the mind of the past he 
meant the records in history and literature 
of what men have done, the story of the 
progress of civilization. By action he 
meant man’s relations to his fellows, not 
business relations alone, or a man’s career, 
vut all that brings him into contact with 
ife in his own time. The World of Nature 
3 important to us because we live in this 
zorld. It is our city. We need to know 
ow: to find our way about in it, just as 
ve need to know how to find our way about 
a the:city which we visit or in which we 
ive: To know this World of Nature 
neatis. to enjoy its beauty, to understand 
and to make use of it through the 
that science has given to us. 
You will observe that this book is an 
ntréduction to each of these three sources 
f education. You can easily name selec- 
ijong.in this book that have a bearing 
ipon’ each of these sources of education. 
Ine’ of the uses of literature is that it has 
his direct application to life. It.is only 
ia introduction; the subjects studied in 
chool-and college, and the experience of 
      life itself, must be drawn upon for the 
complete training to which Emerson refers. 
Thus, you study history as another means 
‘of knowing what he calls the Mind of the 
Past; you study botany and geography 
and physics as another means of knowing 
the World of Nature, while the world of 
action can never be studied merely in 
books. 
In this last section of the book you will 
find some of the things that literature has , 
to say about the world in which we live. ' 
Some of the selections are poems which : 
express the joy that springs in the heart |. 
when one looks on the flowers or the 
trees or the ocean or any other of the 
thousand forms that clothe the world in 
beauty. You do not read these poems in 
order to gain scientific knowledge. If you 
want information about seaweed or the 
ocean you will go to a scientific textbook, 
not to Longfellow’s poems. But the joy 
of the spring is expressed in such poems | 
as those by Wordsworth and Noyes; the 
noble conception of the earth as the tomb 
of man is in Bryant’s “Thanatopsis”; the 
mystery and magic of the sea, even the 
motion of the waves, you find in the poems 
by Longfellow and Byron; the clouds, the 
winds, the marvel of a day in June—all 
ways in which Nature brings a message 
of beauty to our lives—are put into words 
for us by the poets. 
A second way in which we may get 
acquainted with the world in which we 
live is illustrated by the group of selections 
which begins on page 583 with the essay 
called “The Wonders of the World,” by 
Sir John Lubbock. This essay is the work 
of a scientist, not a poet. He was in- 
terested in studying Nature itself, not in 
515 \
-P-A-G-E-525
516 THE WORLD IN 
giving lyrical expression to the emotions 
inspired by Nature. Yet like the poet he 
approaches the subject with a sense of its 
beauty and wonder. In the stories that 
follow, about the ants, the tortoise, the 
coral reefs, the falling star, you have 
other illustrations of the pleasure as well as 
the knowledge that comes from the exact 
observation of Nature. Once more, these 
selections form only an introduction to 
the subject. You will find that the books 
from which they are taken are filled with 
stories just as interesting. What is more, 
when you study geography or botany or 
astronomy, or any other science, you are 
yourself engaged in making the same kind 
of observations. The appeal of Nature 
to the feelings ard imagination may be 
found by anyone who will open his eyes. 
The last four selections introduce you 
to the World of Nature in a different way. 
Here. the theme is the way in. which Na- 
ture aids and serves man. The great 
fields of cotton or hemp or wheat, the giant 
industries that man has built up to make 
life happier and safer—all these are re- 
sults of man’s mastery of Nature and rep- 
resent forces that he has learned to use. 
The story is filled with beauty, like the 
others, This is the service of literature 
( always: to show the beauty and the good 
that are in Nature and in human life. 
There is beauty in the waving fields of 
grain, in the blast furnaces with their 
flames that shoot against the sky at 
night, in the express train, in the great 
ship moving slowly down the bay. And 
in the last selection, written expressly for 
this book, you have a summary of much 
that the book contains. -It is a comment 
in prose upon Emerson’s lines that you 
read on page 513. It shows how our 
present life springs out of what men have 
thought and done in the past; it tells of 
the codperation of men, of the world of 
action in which men work with one another; 
and it shows how Nature serves men and 
contributes to their happiness. WHICH WE LIVE 
I 
Now that you are about to begin the 
reading of this last section of our book on 
Literature and Life, it will be an advan- 
tage if you. will recall some of the stories 
and poems that you have read in the 
earlier parts of the book in order to see 
how largely they, too, draw upon the 
world of Nature. In the “Rime of the 
Ancient Mariner,” for example, you will 
now see not merely a ballad, or a legend 
told in verse, but an illustration of that 
“all-sustaining beauty” that Lowell speaks 
about in his “Vision of Sir Launfal.” The 
Mariner, you will remember, could not 
pray until his hate had turned to love. 
As soon as Nature had taught him this les- 
son of love the spell was broken and he 
could pray. Bryant expresses the same 
thought in’“Thanatopsis’”— 
To him who in the love of Nature holds 
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks 
A various language. 
Finally, throughout the book we see 
how literature, whatever its form or time, * 
is the interpretation of beauty. Beauty of - 
the heroic deed, revealed in ballad and 
epic; beauty of the life of the cottager 
and of all wholesome human relations; 
beauty of the June day and of the delicate 
patterns traced by the frost; the beauty 
of the coral and the falling star; of the 
fields of hemp, of the surge of industry— 
all these themes are one. It is because 
literature in all its varied forms has been 
in all ages and is forever to be an expres- 
sion of 
‘That thread of the all-sustaining Beauty 
Which runs through all and doth all unite, 
that it ministers to the mind and heart 
of man. It is an introduction to all your 
studies. : It is a world of adventure that 
gives zest to living. It is not something 
apart, a means of filling vacant hours, but 
the expression, in terms of beauty, of the 
meaning of life.

LINES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING 
Winusam Worpsworta 
I heard a thousand blended notes, 
While in a grove I sat reclined, 
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts 
Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 
To her fair works did Nature link 5 
The human soul that through me ran; 
And much it grieved my heart to think 
‘What man has made of man. 
Through primrose tufts, in that green 
bower, 
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; 10 
And ’tis my faith that every flower 
Enjoys the air it breathes, 
The birds around me hopped and played— 
Their thoughts I cannot measure— 
But the least motion which they made. 15 
It seemed a thrill of pleasure. 
The budding twigs spread out their fan 
To catch the breezy air; 
And I must think, do all I can, 
That there was pleasure there. 20 
If this belief from Heaven be sent, 
Tf such be Nature’s holy plan, 
Have I not reason to lament 
‘What man has made of man?

Atrrep Noyzs 
Come, choose your road and away, my lad, 
Come, choose your road and away! 
We'll out of the town by the road’s bright 
crown 
As it dips to the dazzling day. 
It’s a long white road for the weary; 5 
But it rolls through the heart of the May. 
Though many a road would merrily ring 
To the tramp of your marching feet, 
All roads are one from the day that’s done, 
And the miles are swift and sweet, 10 
And the graves of your friends are the 
milestones 
To the land where all roads meet. 
But the call that you hear this day, my lad, 
Is the Spring’s old bugle of mirth, 
When the year’s green fire in a soul’s 
desire’ 15 
Is brought like a rose to the birth; 
And knights ride out to adventure 
As the flowers break out of the earth. 
Over the sweet-smelling mountain-passes 
The clouds lie brightly curled; 20 
The wild-flowers cling to the crags and 
swing 
With cataract-dews impearled; 
And the way, the way, that you choose this 
day 
Is the way to the end of the world. 
It rolls from the golden long ago 25 
To the land that we ne’er shall find; 
And it’s uphill here, but it’s downhill there, 
For the road is wise and kind, 
And all rough places and cheerless faces 
‘Will soon be left behind. 30 
Come, choose your road and away, away! ° 
We'll follow the gypsy sun; 
For it’s soon, too soon, to the end of the 
day, 
And the day is well begun; 
And the road rolls on through the heart of 
the May, 35 
And there’s never a May but one.

RHG@CUS- 
A youth named Rheecus, wandering i in 
the wood, 
Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall, 
And, feeling pity of so fair a tree, 
He propped its gray trunk with admiring 
care, 
And with a thoughtless footstep’ loitered 
on. 40 
But, as he turned, he heard a voice behind 
That murmured “Rheecus!’ ’Twas as if 
the leaves, 
Stirred by a passing breath, had murmured 
it, 
And, while he paused bewildered, yet again 
It murmured “Rhcecus!” softer than a 
breeze. 45 
He started, and beheld with dizzy eyes 
What seemed the substance of a happy 
dream 
Stand there before him, spreading a warm 
glow 
Within the green glooms of the shadowy 
* oak, 49 
It seemed a wonian’s shape, yet far too fair 
To be a woman, and with eyes too meek 
For any that were wont to mate with gods. 
All naked like a goddess stood she there, 
And like a goddess all too beautiful 
To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame. 
*“‘Rheecus, I am the Dryad of this tree,” 56 
‘Thus. she began, dropping her low-toned 
words 
Serene, and full, and clear, as drops of dew, 
“And with it I am doomed to live and die; 
The rain and sunshine are my caterers, 60 
Nor have I other bliss than simple life; 
Now ask me what thou wilt, that I can 
give, 
And with a thankful joy it shall be thine.” 
‘Then Rheecus, with a flutter at the heart, 
7et, by the prompting of such beauty, 
bold, 65 
wuswered: “What is there that can satisfy 
‘he endless craving of the soul but love? 
tive me thy love, or but the hope of that 
Vhich must be evermore my spirit’s goal.” 
fter a little pause she said again, 70 
tut with a glimpse of sadness in her tone, 
I give it, Rhoecus, though a perilous gift; 
in hour before the sunset meet me here.” 
ind straightway there was nothing he 
could see - 619 
But the green glooms beneath the shadowy 
oak, ce 
And not a sound came to his straining ears 
But the low trickling rustle of the leaves, 
And far away upon an emerald slope 
The falter of an idle shepherd’s pipe. 
Now, in those days of simpleness and 
faith, 80 
Men did not think that happy things were 
dreams 
Because they overstepped the narrow 
bourne 
Of likelihood, but reverently deemed 
Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful 
To be the guerdon of a daring heart. 85 
So Rhcecus made no doubt that he was 
blest, 
And all along unto the city’s gate 
Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he 
walked, 
The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its 
"wont, 
And he could scarce believe he had not 
wings, 90 
Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his 
veins _ 
Instead of blood, so light he felt and 
strange. : 
Young Rhoecus had a faithful heart 
enough, 
But one that in the present dwelt too much, 
And, taking with blithe welcome whatso- 
_ eer 95 
Chance gave of joy, was wholly bound in 
that, 
Like the contented peasant of a vale, 
Deemed it the world, and never looked be- 
yond. : 
So, haply meeting in the afternoon 
Some comrades who were playing at the 
dice, 100 
He joined them and forgot all else beside. . 
The dice were rattling at the merriest, 
And Rheecus, who had met but sorry luck, 
Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw, 
When through the room there hummed a 
yellow bee 105 
That buzzed about his-ear with down- 
dropped legs
-P-A-G-E-529
520 
As if to light. And Rheecus laughed and 
said, 
Feeling how red and flushed he was with 
loss, 
“By Venus! does he take me for a rose?” 
And brushed him off with rough, impatient 
hand. 110 
But still the bee came back, and thrice 
again 
Rheecus did beat him off with growing 
wrath. 
Then through the window flew the 
wounded bee, 
And Rheecus, tracking him with angry 
eyes, 
Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly 115 
Against the red disk of the setting sun— 
And instantly the blood sank from his 
heart, 
As if its very walls had caved away. 
Without a word he turned, and, rushing 
forth, 
Ran madly through the city and the gate, 
And o’er the plain, which now the wood’s 
long shade, 121 
By the low sun thrown forward broad and 
dim, 
Darkened well-nigh unto the city’s wall. 
Quite spent and out of breath he reached 
the tree, 
And, listening fearfully, he heard once 
more 125 
The low voice murmur “Rheecus!” close 
at hand; 
Whereat he looked around him, but could 
see 
Naught but the deepening glooms beneath 
the oak. 
Then sighed the voice: 
nevermore 
Shalt thou behold me or by day or night, 130 
Me, who would fain have blessed thee with 
a love 
- More ripe and bounteous than ever yet 
Filled up with nectar any mortal heart; 
But thou didst scorn my humble messenger, 
And sent’st him back to me with bruiséd 
wings. 135 
We spirits only show to gentle eyes,

And he who scorns the least of Nature’s 
works 
Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all. 
Farewell! for thou canst never see me 
more.” 140 
Then Rhcecus beat his breast, and 
groaned aloud, 
And cried, “Be pitiful! forgive me yet 
This once, and I shall never need it more!” 
“Alas!” the voice returned, “’tis thou art 
blind, 
Not I unmerciful; I can forgive, 145 
But have no skill to heal thy spirit’s eyes; 
Only the soul hath power o’er itself.” 
With that again there murmured “Never- 
more!” 
And Rheecus after heard no other sound 
‘Except the rattling of the oak’s crisp 
leaves, 150 
Like the long surf upon a distant shore, 
Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down. 
The night had gathered round him; o’er 
the plain 
The city sparkled with its thousand lights, 
And sounds of revel fell upon hisear 155 
Harshly and like a curse; above, the sky, 
With all its bright sublimity of stars, 
Deepened, and on his forehead smote the 
breeze; 
Beauty was all around him and delight, 
But from that eve he was alone on earth.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Judging from the first line of the poem, 
what is the nature of the story following the 
introduction? Why is ignorance represented as 
resting upon “slothful down”? What does the 
poet say of each form of worship adopted by 
» meri? How much of truth does he say is shown 
to the minds of all races? 
2. What poems have you studied in which 
something in Nature brings home a great truth 
—in which trees or flowers direct the thoughts 
to higher things? 
3. What does the first act of Rhecus tell 
you as to the kind of young man he was? 
Describe what he saw as he turned to answer 
the voice. Why was his wish a natural one? 
Read aloud the lines that tell of Rhoecus’s 
great happiness.

you about Rhoecus? How is his apparent for-

reproach. What meaning do you see for others 
besides Rhoecus in the lines © - 
*‘And he-who scorns the least of Nature’s works 
Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all’? 
5. Read the description given each time the 
Dryad disappeared. Does the poet make you 
feel sorry for Rhoecus? Does he make you feel 
that Rheecus’s punishment was deserved? Why 
could he not be given another chance?

Into the woods my Master went, 
Clean forspent, forspent. . 
Into the woods my Master came, 
Forspent with love and shame. 
But the olives they were not blind to Him, 
The little gray leaves were kind to Him; 6 
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him 
When into the woods He came. 
Ont of the woods my Master went, 
Te was well content. 
E the woods my Master came,

Death and Shame would woo Him

under the trees they drew Him last, 
on a tree they slew him—last, 
out of the woods He came. 10

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. Name some of the “visible forms” of 
Nature. What does Bryant say Nature does 
for those who love her? What does he mean? 
2. What is meant by “the last bitter hour,” 
line.9? To what does the poet advise us to 
listen when the thought of death seems terrible? 
Who will be able to hear this still voice? 
8. In the twelfth chapter of Ecclesiastes we 
read, “Then shall the dust return to the earth 
as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God 
Who gave it.” Read lines from “Thanatopsis” 
which show that the poet was thinking of the 
first part of this quotation. What lines tell of 
those lying in that “mighty sepulcher”? 
4. To make us understand that death is 
everywhere, the poet says that the earth is a 
tomb; what things are the decorations of this 
tomb? What comparison does the poet make 
between the number of the living and the num- 
ber of the’ dead? Why does he mention the 
Barcan wilderness and the region of the Oregon 
River as having their dead? 
5. In what lines does the call to action 
come? To what kind of. life does the poet 
urge us? Why? What kind of action will 
make such a life?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. What brings in the seaweed?) To what 
does “he” refer in the first stanza? What 
‘words make you feel the power of the storm- 
wind? 
2. Do you know the location of the far-off 
islands and foreign places that the poet men- 
tions? Do you need to.know in order to appre- 
ciate the poetry? Taken together, what do 
they represent? Where does the seaweed come 
to rest? oo 
8. Notice how the second half of the poem 
repeats both the thought and the form of the 
first half, substituting for the “ocean” the 
“poet’s soul,” and drawing corresponding par- 
allels to the end; point out what ig compared 
to the storm; the seaweed; the far-off isles; 
the tropic lands; the wreck of ships; the restless 
sea; the coves and beaches, Which of the 
comparisons do you like best? 
4. Do you like the short lines riming with 
the long lines? To appreciate this poem you 
need to read it aloud. Read it so as to get 
the best effect from the sound of the lines.

And the tide rises, the tide falls. o 
Darkness settles on roofs and walls, 
But the sea, the sea, in the darkness calls; ° 
Thelittle waves, with their soft, white hands, 
Efface the footprints in the sands, 
And the tide rises, the tide falls. 10

APOSTROPHE TO THE OCEAN 
Lorp Byron 
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; 
There is a rapture on the lonely shore; 
There is society, where none intrudes, 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar— 
I love not mian the less but Nature . 
more, 
From these our interviews, in which I 
steal 6 
From all I may be, or have been before, 
To mingle with the universe, and feel _ 
What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all 
conceal. 
Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean 
—roll! 10 
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in 
vain. a 
Man marks the earth with ruin—his 
control . 
Stops with the shore; upon the watery 
plain. 
The wrecks are all thy deed; nor doth 
remain ' 
A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own, 
When, for a moment, like a drop of rain, 
He sinks into thy depths, with bubbling 
groan— : Ww 
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, 
and unknown. 
His steps are not-upon thy paths—thy 
fields , 
Are not a spoil for him—thou dost arise 
And shake him from thee; the vile 
strength he wields 21 
For’ earth’s destruction thou dost all 
despise, ; 
Spurning him from thy bosom to the 
skies, 
And send’st him, shivering in thy playful 
spray, | And howling to his gods, where haply 
lies 25 
His petty hope in some near port or bay, 
-And dashest him again to earth; there let 
him lay. 
27. lay, wrong word, used for the sake of the rime. THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
The armaments which thunder-strike 
the walls 
Of. rock-built cities, bidding nations 
quake, 
And monarchs tremble in their capitals; 
The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs 
make 31 
Their clay creator the vain title take 
Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war— 
These are thy toys, and, as the snowy 
flake, 
They melt into thy yeast of waves, 
which mar 35 
Alike the Armada’s pride, or spoils of 
. Trafalgar. 
Thy shores are empires changed in all 
save thee— 
Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what 
are they? 
Thy waters washed them power while 
they were free, 
And many a tyrant since; their shores 
obey 40 
The stranger, slave, or savage; their de- 
cay 
Has dried up realms to deserts; not so 
thou— 
Unchangeable save to thy wild waves 
play. 
Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure 
brow; 44 
Such as creation’s dawn beheld, thou 
rollest now. 
Thou glorious mirror, where the Al- 
mighty’s form 
Glasses itself in tempests; in all time, 
Calm or convulsed—in breeze or gale or 
storm, 
Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime 
Dark-heaving; boundless, endless, and 
sublime— 50 
The image of Eternity—the throne 
Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime 
The monsters of the deep are made; each 
zone 
Obeys thee; thou goest forth, dread, 
fathomless, alone.

Of youthful sports was on thy breast to 
be 
Borne, like thy bubbles, onward; from a

I wantoned with thy breakers—they to 
me 
Were a delight; and if the freshening sea 
Made them a terror—’twas a pleasing

For I was as it were a child of thee, 
And trusted to thy billows far and near, 
And laid my hand upon thy mane—as I 
do here.

Against its ground 
Of silvery light, rock, hill, and tree, 
Still as a picture, clear and free, 
With varying outline mark the coast for 
miles around. 10 
On—on—we tread with loose-flung rein 
Our seaward way, 
Through dark-green fields and blossom- 
ing grain, Where the wild brier-rose skirts the Jane, 
And bends above our heads the flowering 
locust spray. 15 
Ha! like a kind hand on my brow 
Comes this fresh breeze, 
Cooling its dull and feverish glow, 
While through my being seems to flow 
The breath of a new life—the healing of the 
seas! 20 
Now rest we, where this grassy mound 
His feet hath set 
In the great waters, which have bound 
His granite ankles greenly round 
With long and tangled moss, and weeds 
with cool spray wet. 25 
Good-by to pain and care! I take 
Mine ease today. 
Here where these sunny waters break, 
And ripples this keen breeze, I shake 
All burdens from the heart, all weary 
thoughts away. : 30

Like all I see— 
Waves in the sun—the white-winged 
gleam . 
Of sea-birds in the slanting beam— 
And far-off sails which flit before the 
southwind free. 35

Nor sink the weight of mystery under,

May have its dawning; 
And, as in summer’s northern night 
The evening and the dawn unite, 
The sunset hues of Time blend with the 
soul’s new morning. 50 
I sit alone; in foam and spray 
‘Wave after wave 
Breaks: on the rocks which, stern and

Shoulder the broken tide away, 
Or murmurs hoarse and strong through 
mossy cleft and cave. 55 
What heed I of the dusty land

I see the mighty deep expand 
From its white line of glimmering sand 
To where the blue of heaven on bluer 
waves shuts down! 60

And passive on the flood reclined,

the road which the poet traveled to the sea- 
shore such as to make him happy or sad? Read 
aloud the lines that give the answer. 
8. Explain the thought, “I seem like all I 
see.” With this thought in mind, the poet 
feels that the “mystery” of the future may not

tenth stanza? How does the poet deseribe the 
horizon? 
5. How does the thirteenth stanza tell that 
the poet feels himself a part of all he sees? By

THE CLOUD 
Percy Brssoe SHELLEY 
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting 
flowers 
’ From the seas and the streams; 
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid 
In their noonday dreams; 
From my wings are shaken the dews that 
waken 5 
The sweet buds every one, 
When rocked to rest on their mother’ s 
breast, 
As she dances about the sun. 
I wield the flail of the lashing hail, 
And whiten the green plains under; 10 
And then again I dissolve it in rain, 
And laugh as I pass in thunder. 
I sift the snow on the mountains below, 
And their great pines groan aghast; 
And all the night ’tis my pillow white, 15 
While I sleep in the arms of the blast. 
Sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers, 
Lightning, my pilot, sits; 
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder— 
It struggles and howls by fits; 20 
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion, 
This pilot is guiding me, 
Lured by the love of the genii that move 
In the depths of the purple sea; 
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills, 
Over the lakes, and the plains, 26

stream, . 
‘The spirit he loves remains; 
And I, all-the while, bask in heaven’s blue

And oh, to be with that ship : 
That I watch through the blinding brine!

Look—on the leafy carpet 5 
Woven of winter’s browns, 
Tris and pink azaleas 
Flutter their gaudy gowns. 
The dogwood spreads white meshes— 
So white and light and high— 10 
To catch the drifting sunlight 
Out of the cobalt sky. 
The pointed beech and maple, 
The pines, dark-tufted, tall,

Of crystal song falls sheer!

TREES 
Buss Carman 
In the Garden of Eden, planted by God, 
There were goodly trees in the springing 529 
Trees of beauty and height. and grace, 
To stand in splendor before His face. 
: Apple and hickory, ash and pear, , 5 
Oak and beech and the tulip rare,’ 
‘The trembling aspen, the noble pine, 
The sweeping elm by the river line; 
Trees for the birds to build and sing, 
And the lilac tree for a joy in spring; 10 
Trees to turn at the frosty call 
And carpet the ground for their Lord’s 
footfall; sO 
Trees for fruitage and fire and shade, 
' Trees for the cunning builder’s trade; 
Wood for the. bow, the spear, and the flail, 
The.keel and the mast of the daring sail— 
He made them of every grain and girth, 17 
For the use of man in the Garden of Earth. 
Then lest the soul should not lift her eyes 
From the gift to the Giver of Paradise, 20 
On the crown of a hill, for all to see, 
God planted a scarlet maple tree.

Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a 
lopsided shock of bloom 
Above a cellar dug into a hill, 20 
You are everywhere. 
You were everywhere. 
‘You tapped the window when the preacher 
preached his sermon, 
And ran along the road beside the boy

You stood by pasture-bars to give the cows

And her husband an image of pure gold. 
‘You flaunted the fragrance of your blos-

You, and sandal-wood, and tea, 30 
Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks 
When a ship was in from China. _ 
You called to them: “Goose-quill men,

Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the

Amid the slant stones of graveyards. 
Pale ghosts who planted you 
Came in the night-time 
And let their thin hair blow through your 
clustered stems. 45 
You are of the green sea, 
And of the stone hills which reach a long 
distance. 
You are of elm-shaded streets with little 
shops where they sell kites and

You are of great parks where everyone 
walks and nobody is at home. 
You cover the blind sides of greenhouses, 50 
And lean over the top to say a hurry-word

To your friends, the grapes, inside.

Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our

May is a green as no other; 
May is much sun through small leaves; 
May is soft earth, 90

And windows open to a South Wind; 
May is a full light wind of lilac 
From Canada to Naragansett Bay.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1. What setting does the poet give the lilacs 
in the first stanza? In what kinds of places 
do the lilacs grow? What is their effect upon 
the Custom House clerks? Have you ever been 
affected in the same way? 
2. Beginning with line 46 how does the 
poem tell that lilacs are of all times and all 
places? Why is this more interesting than to 
say merely “Lilacs are everywhere”? 
3.. How does the poet describe the month 
of May? What part does the lilac play in 531 
these beauties of spring? In the last stanza 
how does the poet express her own feeling for 
the lilac? 
4. The poet, at.the beginning of each stanza, 
names four colors of lilacs; have you noticed 
allfour? What do you think is meant by “false 
blue”? Find as many other instances as you 
can in which the poet has seen more accurately 
and describes more exactly than most people 
do, Has this poem opened your eyes to any 
details of beauty that you had not noticed 
before? Los 
5. Can you tell what it is that makes the 
lines of “Lilacs” flow with such an easy rhythm, 
even though this rhythm is not regular in its 
accent? What is the effect of the very short 
lines? Do you like this “vers libre,” or “free 
verse,” as well as you like poetry with regular 
rhythm and rime?

THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD 
WE LIVE IN 
Sir Jonn Lussock 
The world we live in is a fairyland 
of exquisite beauty, our very exist- 
ence is a miracle in itself, and yet few 
of us enjoy as we might, and none as 
yet appreciate fully, the beauties and 
wonders which surround us. The 
greatest traveler cannot hope even in 
a long life to visit more than a very 
small part of our earth; and even of 
that which is under our very eyes how 10 
little we see! 
What we do. see depends mainly 
on what we look for. When we turn 
our eyes to the sky, it is in most cases 
merely to see whether it is likely to 
rain. In the same field the farmer 
will notice the crop, geologists the 
fossils, botanists the flowers, artists 
the coloring, sportsmen the cover for 
game. Though we may all look at the 2 
' same things it does not at all follow 
that we should see them. 
It is good, as Keble says, “to have 
our thoughis lift up to that world 
where all is beautiful and glorious”’— 
but it is well to realize also how much 
of this world is beautiful. It has, I 
know, been maintained, as for instance 
by Victor Hugo, that the general effect 
of beauty is to sadden. This seems to 30 
me, I confess, a morbid view. There 
are many, no doubt, on whom the effect 
of natural beauty is to intensify feel- 
ing, to deepen melancholy, as well as 
to raise the spirits; As Mrs. W. R. 
Greg in her memoir of her husband 
tells us: “His passionate love for 
Nature, so amply fed by the beauty 
of the scenes around him, intensified 
the emotions, as all keen perception 40 
of beauty does, but it did not add to 
their joyousness. We speak of the 
relies ee Teese ea oglish ‘ug a famous French poet and prose writer (1802-1885). 36. Greg, . Willem 2 Greg (1800-1881), am English essayist
-P-A-G-E-543
    20 4 : THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
,-asure which Nature and art and 
music give us; what we really mean is 
that our whole being is quickened by 
the uplifting of the veil. Something 
passes into us which makes our sor- 
rows more sorrowful, our joys more 
joyful—our whole life more vivid. 
So it was with him. The long, soli- 
tary wanderings over the hills, and 
the beautiful moonlight nights on the 
lake served to make the shadows 
seem darker that were brooding over 
his home.” 
But surely to most of us Nature 
when somber, or even gloomy, is 
soothing and consoling; when bright 
and beautiful, not only raises the 
spirits, but inspires and elevates our 
whole being— 
. | Nature never did betray 
The heart that loved her. ’*Tis her privi- 
lege, 
Through all the years of this our life, to 
lead. 
From joy to joy; for she can so inform 
The mind that is within us, so impress 
With quietness and beauty, and so feed 
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil 
tongues, 
. Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish 
40 men, 
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all 
The dreary intercourse of daily life, 
Shall e’er prevail against us, er disturb 
Our cheerful faith, that all which we be- 
hold 
Is full of blessings. 
Kingsley speaks with enthusiasm 
cf the heaths and moors round his 
home, “‘where I have so long enjoyed 
the wonders of Nature; never, I can 
honestly say, alone; because when 
man was not with me, I had com- 
panions in every bee and flower and 
pebble; and never idle, because I 
could not pass a swamp, or a tuft of 
heather, without finding in it a fairy 
tale of which I could but decipher 
90. From Wordsworth's poem, “Tintern Ab $3. Kinsley, Charles Kingsley. an Nish (4319-18765). mee Ene sothor here and there a line or two, and yet 
found them more interesting than all 
the books, save one, which were ever 
written upon earth.” 
Those who love Nature can never 
be dull. They may have other temp- 
tations; but at least they will run no % 
risk of being beguiled, by ennui, 
idleness, or want of occupation, “to 
buy the merry madness of an hour 
with the long penitence of after time.” 
The love of Nature, again, helps us 
greatly to keep ourselves free from 
those mean and petty cares which 
interfere so much with calm and 
peace of mind. It turns “every ordi- 
nary walk into a morning or evening & 
sacrifice,” and brightens life until it 
becomes almost like a fairy tale. 
In the romances of the Middle 
Ages we read of knights who loved, 
and were loved by, Nature spirits—of 
Sir Launfal and the Fairy Tryamour, 
who furnished him with many good 
things; including a magic purse, in 
which : 
As oft as thou puttest thy hand therein 70 
A mark of gold thou shalt i-win, 
as well as protection from the main 
dangers of life. Such times have 
passed away, but better ones: have 
come. It is not now merely the few 
who are so favored. All’ those who 
love Nature she loves in return, and 
will richly reward, not perhaps, with 
the good things, as they are commonly 
called, but with the best things, of this 80 
world; not with money and titles, 
horses and carriages, but with bright 
and happy thoughts, contentment, 
and peace of mind. 
Happy indeed is the naturalist. 
To him the seasons come round like 
old friends; to him the birds sing; 
as he walks along, the flowers stretch 
out from the hedges, or look up from 
the ground; and as each year fades 90 
- Tl, fewin, obtain.
-P-A-G-E-544
  THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN 
way, he looks back on a fresh store 
£ happy memories. 
Though we can never “remount the 
-iver of our years,” he who loves 
Nature is always young. But what 
is the love of Nature? Some seem to 
think they show a love of flowers by 
gathering them. How often one finds 
a bunch of withered blossoms on the 
roadside, plucked only to be thrown 
away! Is this love of Nature? It is, 
on the contrary, a wicked waste, for a 
waste of beauty is almost the worst 
waste of all. 
Tf we could imagine a day pro- 
longed for a lifetime, or nearly so, 
nd that sunrise and sunset were rare 
vents which happened but a few 
imes to each of us, we should cer- 
ainly be entranced by the beauty of 
he morning and evening tints. The 
olden rays of the morning are a 
ortune in themselves, but we too often 
verlook the loveliness of Nature, be- 
ause it is constantly before us. For 
‘the senseless folk,” says King Alfred, 
is far more struck 
_At things it seldom sees. 
*“Well,” says Cicero, “did Aristotle 
bserve, ‘If there were men whose 
tabitations had been always under- 
round, in great and commodious 
1ouses, adorned with statues and 
victures, furnished with everything 
vhich they who are reputed happy 
bound with; and if, without stirring 
rom thence, they should be informed 
-g of a certain divine power and majesty, 
and, after some time, the earth should 
4 open, and they should quit their dark 
abode to come to us; where they 
’ should immediately behold the-earth, 
4 the seas, the heavens; should con-

deity, but in some sense was itself 7 
instinct with life. They were not only 
peopled by nymphs and fauns, elves 
and kelpies, were not only the favorite | 
abodes of water, forest, or mountain 
spirits, but they had a conscious 
existence of their own.

and demons. These fears, though 
vague, were none the less extreme, and

THE BATTLE OF THE ANTS 
Henry D. Tooreau 
One day when I went out to my 
woodpile, or rather my pile of stumps, 
I observed two large ants, the one red, 
the other much larger, nearly half an 
inch long, and black, fiercely con- 
tending with one another. Having 
once got hold they never let go, but 
struggled and wrestled .and rolled on 
the. chips incessantly. Looking far-
-P-A-G-E-546
     
   
    
    ther, I- was surprised to find that the 
chips ‘were covered with such com- 
batants, that it was not a duellum, 
but a bellum, a war between two races 
of ants, the red always pitted against 
the black, and frequently two red 
ones to one black. The legions of 
these Myrmidons covered all the hills 
and vales’in my wood-yard, and the 
« ground was already strewn with the 
dead and dying, both red and black. 
It was the only battle which I have 
ever witnessed, the only battlefield 
I ever trod while the battle was 
raging; internecine war; the red re- 
black imperialists on the other. On 
every side they were engaged in deadly 
combat, yet without any noise that I 
» could hear, and human soldiers never 
fought so resolutely. I watched a 
couple that were fast locked in. each 
other’s embraces, in a little sunny 
valley amid the chips, now at noonday 
prepared to fight till the sun went 
down, or life went out. The smaller 
red champion had fastened himself 
like a vise to his adversary’s front, 
and through all the tumblings on 
that field never for an instant ceased 
to gnaw at one of his feelers near the 
root, having already caused the 
} other to go by the board; while the 
stronger black one dashed him from 
side to side, and, as I saw on looking 
nearer, had already divested him of 
several of his members. They fought 
with more pertinacity than bulldogs. 
Neither manifested the least disposi- 
: tion to retreat. It was evident that 
their battle-cry was Conquer or Die. 
In the meanwhile there came along a 
single red ant on the hill side of this 
valley, evidently full of excitement, 
> either had dispatched his foe, 
€ liad not yet taken part in the battle; 
probably the latter, for he had lost

none of his limbs; whose mother had 
charged him to return with his shield 
or upon it. Or perchance he was 50 
some Achilles, who had nourished, his 
wrath apart, and had now come to 
avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He 
saw this unequal combat from afar— 
for the blacks were nearly twice the 
size of the red—he drew near with 
rapid pace till he stood on his guard 
within half an inch of the combatants; 
then, watching his opportunity, he 
sprang upon the black warrior, and 60 
commenced his operations near the 
root of his right fore-leg, leaving the 
foe to select among his own members; 
and so there were three united for life, 
as if a new kind of attraction had 
been invented which put all other locks 
and cements to shame. I should not 
have wondered by this time to find 
that they had their respective’musical 
bands stationed on some eminent 7 
chip, and playing their national airs 
the while, to excite the slow and cheer 
the dying combatants. I was myself 
excited somewhat even as if they had 
been men. The more you think of 
it, the less the difference. And cer- 
tainly there is not the fight recorded 
in Concord history, at least, if in the 
history of America, that will bear a 
moment’s comparison with this, so 
whether for the numbers engaged in it, 
or for the patriotism and heroism 
displayed. For numbers and for 
carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dres- 
den. Concord Fight! Two killed 
on the patriots’ side, and Luther 
Blanchard wounded! Why, here every 
ant was a Buttrick—“Fire! for God’s 
sake, fire!’—and thousands shared 
the fate of Davis and Hosmer.

fought for, as much as our ancestors, 
and not to avoid a three-penny tax

battle will be as important and

I took up the chip on which the 
io three I have particularly described .. 
were struggling, carried it into my 
house, and placed it under a tumbler 
on, my window-sill, in order to see the 
issue. Holding a microscope to the 
first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, 
though he was assiduously gnawing 
at the near fore-leg of his enemy, 
having. severed his remaining feeler, 
his own breast was all torn away, ex- 
20 posing what vitals he had there to 
the jaws. of the black warrior, whose 
breastplate was apparently too thick . 
for him to pierce; and the dark car-

with ferocity such as war only could 
excite. They struggled half an hour 
longer under the tumbler, and when

severed the heads of his foes from their

hanging on eitherside of him like ghast-

he was endeavoring with feeble strug- 
gles, being without feelers and with 
only the remnant of a leg, and I know 
not how many other wounds, to divest 
himself of them; which at length,

THE TORTOISE 
GitBERT WHITE 
A Jand tortoise, which has been 
kept for thirty years in a little walled 
court belonging to the house where I 
am now visiting, retires under ground 
about the middle of November, and 
comes forth again about the middle 
of April. When it first appears in the 
spring it discovers very little inclina- 
tion toward food, but in the height 
of summer grows voracious, and then 
as the summer declines, its appetite 
declines; so that for the last six weeks 
in autumn it hardly eats at all. Milky — 
plants, such as lettuces, dandelions, 
sow-thistles, are its favorite © dish. 
In ‘a neighboring village one was kept 
till, by tradition, it was supposed to 
be a hundred years old—an instance 
f vast longevity in such a poor reptile! 
On the first of November I remarked 
“that the old tortoise began first. to dig the ground, in order to the form- 
ms

ing of its hibernaculum, 
fixed on just beside a great tuft of 
hepaticas. It scrapes out the ground 
with its fore-feet, and throws it. up 
over its back with its hind; but the 
motion of its legs is ridiculously slow, 
little exceeding the hour-hand of a 
clock. Nothing can be more assidu- 
ous than this creature night and day 
in scooping the earth, and forcing its 
great body into the cavity; but as the 
noons of that season proved unusually 
warm and sunny, it was continually 
interrupted, and called forth, by the 
heat of the middle of the day; and 
though I continued there till the 
thirteenth of November, yet the work 
remained unfinished. Harsher wea- 
ther and frosty mornings would have 
quickened its operations. 
No part of its behavior ever struck 
me more than the extreme timidity 
it always expresses with regard to 
rain; for though it has‘a shell that 
would secure it against the wheel of 
a loaded cart, yet does it discover as 
much solicitude about rain as a lady 
dressed in all her best attire, shuffling 
away on the first sprinklings, and 
running its head up in a corner. If 
attended to, it becomes an excellent 
weather-glass; for as sure as it walks 
elate, and as it were, on tiptoe, feed-' 
ing with great earnestness in a morn- 
ing, so sure will it rain before night. 
Itis totally a diurnal animal, and never 
pretends to stir after it becomes dark. 
The tortoise, like other reptiles, 
has an arbitrary stomach, as well as 
lungs, and can refrain from eating as 
well as breathing for a great part of 
the year. When first awakened, it 
eats nothing; nor again in the autumn. 
before it retires. Through the height 
of the summer it feeds voraciously, 
devouring all the food that comes in 
its way. I was much taken with its 
sagacity in discerning those that do 
it kind offices; for as soon as the good which it had ~ 539 
old lady "comes in sight who has 50 
-waited on it for more than. thirty 
years, it hobbles toward its benefac- 
tress with awkward alacrity; but 
remains inattentive to strangers. Thus 
not only “the ox knoweth his owner, 
-and the ass his master’s crib,” but 
the most abject reptile and torpid of 
beings distinguishes the hand th: 
feeds it, and is touched with the fee 
ings of gratitude. , 
[The account of the tortoise which fo 
lows was written some time later tha 
what has just preceded.] . 
The old Sussex tortoise has now be- 
come my property. I dug it out of its 
winter dormitory in March last, when . 
it was enough awakened to express 
its resentments by hissing; and, pack- 
ing it in a box with earth, carried it 
eighty miles in postchaises. The rat- 
tle and hurry of the journey so per- 
fectly roused it that when I turned 
it out on a border, it walked’ twice 70 
down to the bottom of my garden; 
however; in the evening, the weather 
being cold, it buried itself in the loose 
mold, and continues still concealed. 
As it will be under my eye, I shall 
now have an opportunity of enlarging 
my observations on its mode of life - 
and propensities; and perceive already 
that, toward the time of coming forth, 
it opens a breathing-place in the so 
ground near its head, requiring, I con- 
clude, a freer respiration as it becomes 
more alive. This creature not only 
goes under the earth from the middle 
of November to the middle of April, 
but sleeps a great part of the summer; 
for it goes to bed, in the longest days, i : 
at four in the afternoon, and often 60 
does not :stir in, the morning till late.’ 
Besides, it retires to rest at every 
shower, and does not move at all is 
wet days. e 
When one reflects on the state st- 
this strange being, it is a matterion

wonder to find that Providence should 
bestow such a profusion of days, such 
a seeming waste of longevity, on a 
reptile that appears to relish it so 
little as to squander more than two- 
thirds of its existence in a joyless, 
stupor, and be lost to all sensation for 
months together in the profoundest 
of slumbers. 
While I was writing this letter, a 
moist and warm afternoon, with the 
thermometer at 50, brought forth 
trocos of shell-snails; and, at the same 
juncture, the tortoise heaved up the 
mold and put out its head; and the next 
morning came forth, as it were raised 
from the dead, and walked about 
till four in the afternoon. This was a 
curious coincidence! a very amusing 
20 occurrence! to see such a similar- 
ity of feeling between two gegéorxot, 
for so the Greeks call both the shell- 
snail and the tortoise. 
Because we call this creature an 
abject. reptile, we are too apt to 
undervalue his abilities and depre- 
ciate his powers of instinct. Yet he 
is, as Mr. Pope says of his lord, 
Much too wise to walk into a well; 
‘30 and has. so much discernment as not 
to fall down an ha-ha, but will stop 
and withdraw from the brink with 
the readiest : precaution. 
Though he loves warm weather he 
avoids the hot sun, because his thick 
shell, when once heated, would, as 
the poet says of solid armor, “scald 
with safety.” He therefore spends 
the more sultry hours under the um- 
\40 brella of a cabbage leaf or amidst the 
y Waving forests of an asparagus bed. 
But as he avoids the heat in summer, . 
so, in the decline of the year, he im-

FORMATION OF CORAL 
Louis AGassiz 
Every zone of the earth’s sur 
has its own animals, suited to 
conditions under which they are meant 
to live; and, -with- the exceptior 
those that accompany man in all 
pilgrimages, and are subject to
-P-A-G-E-550

same modifying influences by which 
he adapts his home and himself to all 
climates, animals are absolutely bound 
50 by the laws of their hature within the . 
range assigned to them. Nor is this 
| the case only on land, where river 
banks, lake shores, and mountain 
ranges might be supposed to form the 
impassable boundaries that keep ani- 
10 mals within certain limits; but the 
ocean, as well as the land, has its 
| faunee and flores bound within their 
: respective zoological and botanical 
provinces; and a wall of granite is not 
more impassable to a marine animal 
than that ocean line, fluid, and flowing, 
and ever-changing though it be, on 
| which is written for him, “Hitherto 
shalt thou come, but no farther.” 
[° One word as to the effect of pressure 
on animals will explain this. 
We all live under the pressure of the 
atmosphere. Now, thirty-two feet 
under the sea doubles that pressure, 
| since a column of water of that height 
! is equal in weight to the pressure of 
one atmosphere. At the depth of 
thirty-two feet, then, any marine 
animal is under the pressure of two 
3% atmospheres—that of the air, which 
surrounds our globe, and of a weight 
of water equal to it; at sixty-four feet 
j he is under the pressure of three 
| atmospheres, and so on—the weight 
| of one atmosphere being always added 
for every thirty-two feet of depth. 
There is a great difference in the sensi- 
tiveness of animals to this pressure. 
Some fishes live at a great depth, and 
wv find the weight of water genial to 
| them; while others would be killed at 60 
once by the same pressure; and the 
j latter naturally seek the shallow 
waters. Every fisherman knows that 
he must throw a long line for hali- 
j but, while with a common fishing-rod 
he will catch plenty of perch from the 
rocks near the shore; and the differ-

ently colored bands of seaweed re- 
vealed by low tides show that. the 50 
flore as well as the faunse of the ocean 
have their precise boundaries. 
Of all. air-breathing animals, none 
exhibits a more surprising power of 
adapting itself to great and rapid 
changes of external’ influences than 
the condor. It may be seen feeding 
on the seashore under a burning tropi- 
eal sun, and then, rising from its 
repast, it floats up among the highest so 
summits of the Andes, and is lost’ to 
sight beyond them,’ mii:s’ 44¢*e the 
line of perpetual snow, wuere the 
temperature must be lower than that 
‘of the Arctics. But even the condor, 
sweeping at one flight from tropic 
heat to arctic cold, although it passes 
through greater changes of tempera- 
ture, does not undergo such changes of 
pressure as a fish that rises from a 70 
depth of sixty-four feet to the surface of 
the sea; for the former remains within 
the limits of one atmosphere; while 
the latter, at a depth of sixty-four 
feet, is under a weight equal to. that 
of three such atmospheres, which is 
reduced to one when it reaches the 
sea-level. The change is proportion- 
ally greater for those fishes that come 
from a depth of several hundred feet. 80 
These laws of limitation in space ex- 
plain many facts in the growth of 
coral reefs that would be otherwise 
inexplicable, and which I now will 
endeavor to make clear to my readers. 
For a long time it was supposed 
that the reef-builders inhabited very 
deep waters, for they were sometimes 
brought up on sounding-lines from a 
depth of many hundreds, or even 90 
thousands, of feet, and it was taken 
for granted that they must have had 
their home where they were found; 
but the facts recently ascertained re- 
specting the subsidence of ocean-bot- 
toms have shown that the foundation 
of a coral wall may have sunk far \
-P-A-G-E-551
  542 
below the place where it was laid. 
And it is now proved, beyond a doubt, 
that no reef-building coral can thrive 
at a depth of more than fifteen fath- 
oms, though corals of other kinds occur 
far lower, and that the dead reef- 
corals, sometimes brought to the sur- 
face from much greater depths, are 
only broken fragments of some reef 
10 that has subsided with the bottom on 
which it was growing. But though 
fifteen fathoms is the maximum depth, 
at which any reef.},nilder can prosper, 
there oo, seveay Which will not sustain 
_ even that degree of pressure; and this 
fact has, as we shall see, an important 
influence on the structure of the reef. 
Imagine now a sloping shore on 
some tropical coast descending gradu- 
20 ally below the surface of the sea. 
Upon that slope, at a depth of from 
ten to twelve or fifteen fathoms, and 
two or three or more miles from the 
mainland, according to the shelving 
of the shore, we will suppose that one 
of those little coral animals, to whom 
a home in such deep waters is genial, 
has established itself. How it hap- 
pens that such a being, which we know 
30 is immovably attached to the ground, 
and forms the foundation of a solid: 
wall, was ever able to swim freely 
about in the water till it found a suit- 
able ‘resting-place, I shall explain 
hereafter, when I say something of 
the mode of reproduction of these 
animals. Accept, for the moment, 
my unsustained assertion, and plant 
our little coral on this sloping shore, 
40 some twelve or fifteen fathoms below 
the surface of the sea. 
The internal structure of such a 
coral corresponds to that of the sea- 
anemone. The body is divided by 
vertical partitions from top to bottom, 
leaving open chambers between; while 
in the center hangs the digestive cav-

the top is an aperture serving as

the coral is identical in all its’ p:

of the body are rigid, with the excep- 
tion of the upper margin, the stomach, 
and the tentacles. The tentacles are 
soft and waving, projected or drawn 
in at will; they retain their flexible 
| character through life, and decom- 
pose when the animal dies. For ‘this 
reason the dried specimens of corals 
preserved in museums do not give 
us the least idea of the living corals, 
in which every one of the millions of 
beings composing such a community 
is crowned by a waving wreath of 
white or green or rose-colored ten- 
tacles. 
As soon as the little coral is fairly 
established and solidly attached to 
the ground, it begins to bud. This 
may take place in a variety of ways, 
dividing at the top or budding from 
the base or from the sides, till the 
primitive animal is surrounded by a [ aq number of individuals like itself, of 
which it forms the nucleus, and which 
now begin to bud in their turn, each 
| one surrounding itself with a numer- 
ous progeny, all remaining, however, 
attached to the parent. Such a com- 
munity increases till its individuals 
are numbered by millions; and I have 
myself counted no less than fourteen 
millions of individuals in a coral mass 
s| of porites measuring not more than 
twelve feet in diameter. The so-called 
j coral heads, which make the founda- 
tion of a coral wall, and seem by their 
massive character and regular form 
especially adapted to give a strong, 
solid base to the whole structure, are 
fo known in our classifications as: the 
astreeans, so named on account of the 
star-shaped form of the little pits 
srowded upon their surface, each one 
of which marks the place of a single 
more or less isolated individual ‘in 
such a community. 
Thus firmly and strongly is the 
foundation of the reef laid by the as- 
treans; but we have seen that for "548 
their prosperous growth they require 
a certain depth and pressure of water, 
and when they have brought the wall 
so high that they have not more than 
six fathoms of water above them, this 
kind of coral ceases to grow. They. 
have, however, prepared a fitting sur- 
face for different kinds of corals that 
could not live in the depths from which 
the astrzans have come, but find their 
genial home nearer the surface. Such 
a home being made ready for them by 
their predecessors, they. now establish 
themselves on the top of the coral wall 
and continue its growth for a certain 
time. 
* * * 
But these also have their bounds 
within the sea; they in their: turn 
reach the limit beyond which they are 
forbidden by the laws of their nature 
to pass, and there they also pause. 
But the coral wall continues its steady 
progress; for here the lighter kinds 
set in, and the reef is crowned at last 
with a many-colored shrubbery of low, 
feathery growth. 
With these branching corals the 
reef reaches the level of high-water, 
beyond which, as I have said, there 
can be no further growth, for want of 
the action of the fresh sea-water.

A FALLING STAR 
Srr Rosert 8. Baty 
Everyone who has occasionally taken 
a nocturnal walk in the open country 
will probably have seen what is 
Perhaps I 
might rather say that unless the 
-observer be very inattentive he will 
have noticed dozens, or scores, or 
hundreds of these objects, either bright 
or faint, with long streaks or with 
short. , 
For the due exhibition of a shooting 
star, that part of the sky where it 
is displayed should, of course, be 
free from cloud, and the silvery streak 
will seem all the more vivid if the 
moon be absent. No telescope is 
needed. This is, indeed, the one 
branch of astronomical observation in 
which the unaided eye can advan- 
tageously dispense with optical assist- 
ance. : 
Our present knowledge as to the 
natural history of the shooting stars 
has been mainly acquired during the 
Jast hundred years. The first im- 
portant step in the comprehension of 
these bodies was to recognize that 
the brilliant flash of light was caused’ 
by some object which came from 
without and plunged into our air. 
This was known at the end of the 
last century, largely by the labors of 
the philosopher Chladni in 1794. 
But even his sagacity did not prevent 
him from making some serious mis-

  takes about the nature of shootin 
stars. It has been reserved for th 
present generation to organize a multi 
tude of facts into a connected whole. 
and thus contribute a very interesti 
chapter to modern astronomy. 
Could an ordinary shooting s 
tell us its actual history, the narrativ 
would run somewhat as follows: 
“I was a small bit of material}

me as a sort of small stone, yet I 
think you would have added that I

slower; but I have generally done 
my million miles a day at the very 
least. Such has been my career, not 
for hours or days, but for years and 
for centuries, probably for untold 
ages. And the grand catastrophe in 
which I vanished has been befitting 
to a life of such transcendent excite- 
ment and activity; I have perished 
instantly, and in a streak of splendor. 
In the course of my immemorial 
wanderings I have occasionally passed 
near some of the great bodies in the 
heavens; I have also not improbably 
in former years hurried by that globe 
on which you live. On those occa- 
sions you never saw me, you never 
could have seen me, not even if you 
had used the mightiest telescope that 
has ever been directed to the heavens. 
But too close an approach to your 
globe was at last the occasion of my 
fall. You must remember that you 
live on the earth buried beneath a 
great ocean of air. Viewed from out- 
side space, your earth is seen to be 
a great ball, everywhere swathed with 
this thick coating of air. Beyond 
the appreciable limits of the air 
stretches the open space, and there 
it is that my prodigious journeys have 
been performed. Out there we have 
a freedom to move of which you who 
live in a dense atmosphere have no 
conception. Whenever you attempt 
to produce rapid motion on the earth, 
the resistance of your air largely de- 
tracts from the velocity that would 
be otherwise attainable. Your quick 
trains are impeded by air, your ar- 
tillery ranges are shortened by it. 
Movements like mine would be im- 
possible in air like yours. 
“And this air it is which has ulti- 
mately compassed my destruction. 
So long as I merely passed near your 
earth, but kept clear of that deadly 
net which you have spread, in the 
shape of your atmosphere, to entrap “845 
the shooting stars, all went well with 
me. I felt the ponderous mass of 
the earth, and I swerved a little in 
compliance with its attraction; but 
my- supreme velocity preserved me, 
and I hurried past unscathed. I 
had many narrow escapes from capture 
during the lapse of those countless 
ages in which I have been wandering 
through space. But at last I ap- 
proached once too often to the earth. 
On this fatal oceasion my course led 
me to graze your globe so closely that 
I could not get by without traversing 
the higher parts of the atmosphere. 
Accordingly, a frightful catastrophe 
immediately occurred. Not to you; 
it did you no harm; indeed, quite 
the contrary. My dissolution gave 
you a pleasing and instructive exhibi- 
tion. It was then, for the first time, 
that you were permitted to see me, 
and you called me a shooting star 
or a meteor. 
“You are quite familiar with the 
disasters associated with the word 
collision. Some of the most awful 
accidents you have ever heard of arose 
from the collision of two railway trains 
on land or of two ships in the ocean. 
You are thus able to realize the 
frightful consequences of .a collision 
between two heavy bodies. But in 
the collision which annihilated me I 
did not impinge against any other 
heavy body. I only struck the upper 
and extremely rare layers of your 
atmosphere. I was, however, mov- 
ing with a speed so terrific that the 
impulse to which I was exposed when 
I passed from empty space even into 
‘thin air was sufficient for my total 
disruption. 
“Had the speed with which J 
entered your atmosphere been more 
moderate—had it been, for instance, 
not greater than that of a rifle bullet, 
or even only four or five times as fast, 
this plunge would not have been fatal ~ 70

to me. I could have pierced through 
with comparative safety, and then 
have tumbled down in my original 
form on the ground. Indeed, on rare 
occasions something of this kind does 
actually happen. Perhaps it is for- 
tunate for you dwellers on the earth. 
that we shooting stars do generally 
become dissipated in the upper air. 
10 Were it not so, the many thousands 
of us which would be daily pelting 
down on your earth would introduce 
a new source of anxiety into your lives. 
Fortunately for you, we dart in at a 
speed of some twenty miles or more 
a.second. Unfortunately for us, we 
soon learn that it is the ‘pace which 
kills.’ 
“When from the freedom of open 
20 space I darted into the atmosphere, 
I rubbed past every particle of air 
which I touched in my impetuous 
flight, and in doing so I experienced 
the usual consequence of friction—I 
was warmed by the operation. If you 
tub a button on a board it will become 
warm. If you rub two pieces of wood 
together you can warm them, and you 
could even produce fire if you pos- 
30 sessed the cunning skill of some peo- 
ple whom you are accustomed to 
speak of as savages. Nor need you 
be surprised to find that I was warmed 
by merely rubbing against air. If 
you visit a rifle range and pick up 
a fragment of a bullet which has just 
struck the target you will find it 
warm; you will even find it so hot 
that you will generally drop it. Now 
40 whence came this heat? The bullet 
was certainly cold ere the trigger 
was pulled.. No doubt there is some 
heat developed by the combustion of 
the gunpowder, but the bullet cannot 
“be much warmed thereby; it is, in- 
deed, protected from the immediate 
effect of the heat of the powder by 
the wad. The bullet is partly warmed 
by the friction of rubbing against the THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
‘barrel of the rifle, but doubtless it a    
     
         receives some heat by the friction o 
the air and some from the consequen 
of its percussion against the target] 
You need not, then, wonder how it is 
that when I am checked by your ‘t- 
mosphere I, too, am heated. 
“Remember that I move a hun- 
dred times, as swiftly as your rifle

  A FALLING STAR 
You, standing on your earth many 
niles below, never saw me—never 
‘ould have seen me—until this su- 
meme moment, when, glowing with 
wn instantaneous fervor, I for a 
wief second became visible. You 
shouted, ‘Oh! there is a shooting 
itar.” 
“Nature knows no annihilation, and 
-hough I had been driven off into 
vapor and the trial by fire had scat- 
tered and dispersed me, yet in the 
lofty heights of atmosphere those 
vapors cooled and condensed. They 
did not, they never could again reunite 
and reproduce my pristine structure. 
Here and there in wide diffusion I 
repassed from the vaporous to the 
solid form, and in this state I wore 
the appearance of a streak of minute 
granules distributed all along the 
highway I had followed. These gran- 
ules gradually subsided through the* 
air to the earth. On Alpine snows, far 
removed from the haunts of men and 
from the contamination of chimneys, 
' minute particles have been gathered, 
many of which have unquestionably 
been derived from the scattered re- 
mains of shooting stars. Into the 
sea similar particles are forever fall- 
ing, and they have been subsequently 
dredged up from profound depths, 
having subsided through an ocean 
| of water after sinking through an ocean 
of air. 
“The motes by which a sunbeam 
through a chink in a. closed shutter is 
rendered visible are no doubt mainly 
of organic origin, but they must also 
frequently comprise the meteoric gran- 
ules! These motes gradually sub- 
side upon the tops of your bookcases 
or into other congenial retreats to 
form that dust of which good house- 
Keepers have such a horror. It is 
certain that the great majority of the 
particles of which ordinary dust is 
constituted lave purely terrestrial 547 
sources which it would be impossible 
to endow with any romantic interest. 
. It is equally certain that in a loathed 50 
dust-heap are many atoms. which, - 
considering their celestial origin and 
their transcendent voyages, would 
have merited a more honored resting- 
place.” 
* * * 
The world is pelted on. all sides 
day and night, year after year, cen- 
tury after century, by troops and 
battalions of shooting: stars of every 
size, from objects not much larger 
than grains of sand up to mighty 
masses which ‘can only be expressed 
in tons. In the lapse of ages our 
globe must thus be gradually growing 
by the everlasting deposit of meteoric 
debris. Looking back through the 
vistas of time past, it becomes im- 
possible to estimate how much of 
the solid earth may not owe its 
origin to this celestial source. 
* * 
The great sun guides our world 
through its long, annual journey. 
The mighty mass of the earth yields 
compliance to the potent sway of 
the ruler of our system. But the 
sun does not merely exercise control 
over the vast planets which circulate 
around him. The supreme law of 
gravitation constrains the veriest mote 
that ever floated in a sunbeam, with 
the same unremitting care that it 
does the mightiest of planets. Thus 
it is that each little meteor is guided 
in its journeys for untold ages. Each 
of these little objects hurries along, 
deflected at every moment, to follow 
its beautifully curved path by the 
incessant attractions of the sun. At 
last, however, the final plunge is 
taken. The long wanderings of the 
meteor have come to an end, and it 
vanishes in a streak of splendor. 60

COTTON AND THE OLD SOUTH* 
James A. B. ScHERER — 
In the autumn of 1792 a young col- 
lege graduate sailed from New York 
for Savannah, on his way to South 
Carolina to teach school. He had 
never seen a boll of cotton in his life. 
A year later he made the first cotton 
gin, which caused his great and gener- 
ous rival in inventive genius, Robert 
Fulton, to class him among the three 
men who accomplished more for man- 
kind than any other men of their 
times. 
The eagerness of Southern planters 
to grow upland cotton, after it could 
‘be’ ginned, almost passes belief. Five 
months after he had obtained his 
patent Whitney wrote: “We shall not 
be able to get machines made as fast 
as we shall want them. We have now 
eight hundred thousand weight of cot- 
ton on hand and the next crop will 
begin to come in very soon. Tt will

    COTTON. AND THE OLD SOUTH 
that the South devoted itself thence- 
forward with undivided attention to 
the production of that precious com- 
modity for which two continents 
clamored, and which the South alone 
could supply. 
Certainly the life of the South from 
this time forward revolved around the 
cotton plant. Early in the spring the 
negroes with their multitudinous mules 
began the plowing of straight, long, 
deep furrows in the fragrant mellow 
soil—the deeper the better, since cot- 
ton has a tap-root which, if properly 
invited, will sink four feet in searching 
for fresh food and moisture. Fertilizer, 
consisting of manure and malodorous 
guano, or, in later times, expensive 
phosphates, is laid in the center of the 
“beds” thrown up by the furrows; and 
the time of actual planting awaited. 
When the ‘first song of the “turtle 
dove” is heard, and the starry blooms 
of the dogwood light up the edge of 
the forest, and the frosts are thought, 
to be over, came, in the old days, 
flocks of black women with hoes, 
scooping out the beds at rough in- 
tervals, followed by: other women, 
dropping careless handfuls of seed. The 
tender green plants, thrusting their 
way. upward shortly, were thinned 
out, one stalk to a foot. When 
two or three weeks above the surface, 
more plowing was needful, to break 
the new crust of the soil and kill weeds. 
Then, every three weeks thereafter, 
until the steaming “dog days” of 
August, the patient plow would break 
the crust again and again, so that on 
the larger plantations the plows never 
ceased, but returned continually from 
the last furrows of far-stretching acres 
to break the first furrows of another 
three weeks’ task. Hoeing, mean- 
while, kept the women busy with the 
grass and weeds. In early August the 
crop was “laid by,” and required no 
more work till picking time. 549 
Meanwhile, under proper conditions 
this incessant labor would transform 
the fields into flower gardens. By 
June the beautiful blossoms are blush- 
ing; bell-shaped and softly brilliant, 50 
here and there, with the magic trick . 
of changing their colors, as a maid her 
clothes. Shimmering in the morning 
in a creamy white or pale straw dress, 
and closing its silky petals in the eve- 
ning, the flower on the second day of 
its fragile life shifts to a wild-rose col- 
or, deepening by evening to magenta 
or carnation; all this, for three brief 
but brilliant days, on graceful stems 
knee-high, rich in glossy dark-green 
foliage; so that the aspect of a spacious 
level field, with fresh blossoms bud- 
ding into cream or cloth of gold, while 
elder sisters smile in pink and red 
amidst the trembling verdure, is of 
a splendid variegated beauty that 
lends to the Southern landscape half 
its charm. It is in this summer sea- 
son the Southern children sing: 
First: day white, next day red, 
Third day from my birth I’m dead; 
‘Though I am of short duration, 
Yet withal I clothe the nation. . 
From mid-August until winter, how- 
ever, and especially in that “season 
of mellow fruitfulness,’’ October, the 
cotton shrub becomes a thing of won- 
der; adding to its garniture of bloom 
the bursting pods of snowy fleece that 
dominate the coloring of the fields into 
the semblance of a vegetative snow- 
storm. Then, on the old plantation, 
swarmed forth the turbaned mammies 
and the wenches, shining pickaninnies 
and black babes in arms, with bags 
and huge baskets and mirth, nimble 
fingers, as it were, predestined to the 
cotton pod, to live in the sunshine 
amid the fleecy snow, and pile up 
white fluffy mounds at the furrows’ 
ends, chanting melodies, minor chords 
of song as old as Africa, the women 
trooping home again at nightfall with

heads, to feasts of corn-pone and crack-

and the whole shining South “feels

Of the distinctive civilization of 
the old Southern cotton life no words 
could be more pertinent than Grady’s. 
“That was a peculiar society,” he 
said. “Almost feudal in its splendor,

plicity. Leisure and wealth gave it

from care, gave to their sons, through 
patient and constant training, some- 
thing of their own grace and gentle- 
ness, and to their homes beauty and 
light. Its people, homogeneous by 
necessity, held straight and simple 
faith, and were religious to a marked 
degree along the old lines of Christian 
belief. The same homogeneity bred 
a hospitality that was as kinsmen to 
kinsmen, and that wasted at the 
threshold of every home what the 
more frugal people of the North con- 
served and invested in public chari- 
ties. Money counted least in mak- 
ing the social status, and constantly 
ambitious and brilliant youngsters 
from no estate married into the fam- 
ilies of planter princes. Meanwhile, 
the one character utterly condemned 
and ostracized was the man who was 
mean to his slaves. Even the coward 
was pitied and might have been liked. 
For the cruel master there was no 
toleration. 
“In its engaging grace—in the 
chivalry that tempered even quixotism 
with dignity—in the piety that saved 
master and slave alike—in the charity 
that boasted not—in the honor held 
above estate—in the hospitality that 
neither condescended nor cringed— 
in frankness and heartiness and whole- 
some comradeship—in the reverence 
paid to womanhood and the inviolable 
respect in which woman’s name was 
held—the civilization of the old slave 
régime in the South has not been sur- 
passed, and perhaps will not be 
equaled, among men.”

THE HEMP FIELDS 
JamEs LANE ALLEN ' 
Some morning when the roar of 
March winds is no more heard in the 
tossing woods, but along still brown 
boughs a faint, veil-like greenness 
runs; when every’ spring, welling out 
of the soaked earth, trickles through 
banks of sod unbarred by ice; before 
a bee is abroad under the calling sky; 
before the red of apple-buds becomes 
a sign in the low orchards, or the high 
song of the thrush is pouring forth far 
away at wet, pale-green sunsets, the 
sower, the earliest sower of the hemp, 
goes forth into the fields. 
Warm they must be, soft and warm, 
those fields, its chosen birthplace. 
Upturned by the plow, crossed and 
recrossed by the harrow, clodiess, 
leveled, deep, fine, fertile—some ex- 
tinct river-bottom, some valley thread- 
ed by streams, some tableland of mild 
rays, moist airs, alluvial or limestone 
soils—such is the favorite cradle of 
the hemp in Nature. Back and forth 
with measured tread, with measured 
distance, broadcast the sower sows, 
scattering with plenteous hand those 
small, oval-shaped fruits, gray-green, 
black-striped, heavily packed with 
living marrow. 
Lightly covered over by drag or 
harrow, under the rolled earth now 
they lie, those mighty, those inert, 
seeds, Down into the darkness about 
them the sun’s rays penetrate day by 
day, stroking them with the brushes 
of light, prodding them with spears 
of flame. Drops of nightly dews, 551 
drops from the coursing clouds, trickle 
down to them, moistening the dryness, 
closing up the little hollows of the 
ground, drawing the particles of ma- 
terna) earth more closely. Suddenly 
—as an insect that has been feigning 
death cautiously unrolls itself and

awakens as from a sleep, as from pre- , 
tended death. It starts, it moves, it 
bursts its ashen, woody shell; it takes 
two opposite courses: the white, fibril- 
tapered root hurrying away from the 
sun; the tiny stem, bearing its lance- 
like leaves, ascending graceful, brave 
like a palm. 
Some morning, not many days later, 
the farmer, walking out into his 
barn-lot and casting a look in the 
direction of his field, sees—or does 
he not see?—the. surface of it less 
dark. What is that uncertain flush 
low on the ground, that irresistible 
tush of multitudinous green? A fort- 
night, and the field is brown no longer. 
Overflowing it, burying it out of sight, 
is the shallow, tidal sea of the hemp, 
ever rippling. Green are the woods 
now with their varied greenness. 
Green are the pastures. Green here 
and there are the fields: with the 
bluish green of young oats and wheat; 
with the gray green of young barley 
and rye; with orderly dots of dull 
dark green in vast array—the hills of 
Indian maize. But as the eye sweeps 
the whole landscape undulating far 
and near, from the hues of tree, pas- 
ture, and corn of every kind, it turns 
to the color of the hemp. With that 
in view, all other shades in Nature 
seem dead and count for nothing. 
Far reflected, conspicuous,. brilliant, 
strange; masses of living emerald, 
saturated with blazing sunlight. 
Darker, always darker turns the 
hemp as it rushes upward; scarce 
darker as to the stemless stalks which

are hidden now, but darker in the 
tops. : Yet here two shades of green- 
ness: the male plants paler, smaller, 
maturing earlier, dying first; the 
females darker, taller, living longer, 
more luxuriant of foliage and flowering 
heads. 
A hundred days from the sowing, 
and those flowering heads have come 
forth with their mass of leaves and 
bloom and earliest fruits, elastic, 
swaying six, ten, twelve feet from the 
ground and ripe for cutting; a hun- 
dred days reckoning from the last of 
March or the last of April, so that it 
is July, it is August. And now, 
borne far through the steaming air 
floats. an odor, balsamic, startling, . 
the odor of those plumes and stalks 
and blossoms from which. is exuding 
freely the narcotic resin of the great 
nettle. The nostril expands quickly, 
the lungs swell out deeply to draw it 
in—fragrance once known in child- 
hood, ever in the memory afterward 
and able to bring back to the wan- 
derer homesick thoughts of midsum- 
mer days in the shadowy, many-toned 
woods, over into which is blown the 
smell of the hemp-fields. 
Who apparently could number the 
acres of these in the days gone by? 
A land of hemp, ready for the cutting! 
The oats heavy-headed, rustling, have 
turned to gold and been stacked in 
the stubble or stored in the lofts of 
white, bursting barns. The heavy- 
headed,. rustling wheat has turned to 
gold and been stacked in the stubble 
or sent through the whirling thresher. 
The barley and the rye are garnered 
and gone, the landscape has many 
bare and open spaces. But, separat- 
ing these everywhere, rise the fields 
of Indian corn now in blade and tassel; 
and—more valuable than all else that 
has been sown and harvested or 
remains to be—everywhere the im- 
penetrable thickets of the hemp. THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

sparrow will flutter away from pollen- 
bearing to pollen-receiving top, trying 
to beguile you from its nest hidden 
near the edge. The crow and the 
blackbird will seem to love it, having

Those lithe, velvety, summer-thin bod-

still hemp. Are they slightly shaken? 
Among the bases of those stalks a 
cotton-tail is threading its way inward 
beyond reach of its pursuer. Are 
they shaken violently, parted clean 
and wide to right and left? It is the

scent—ever baffled.

+ Into the cutting of the hemp. The 
leader strides to the edge, and throw- 
ing forward his left arm, along which 
the muscles play, he grasps as much 
as it will embrace, bends the stalks 
over, and with his right hand draws 
the blade through them an inch or 
more from the ground. When he 
has gathered his armful, he turns and 
flings it down behind him, so that it 
lies spread out, covering when fallen 
. the same space it filled while standing. 
And so he crosses the broad acres, and 
so each of the big black followers, step- 
ping one by one to a place behind 
him, until the long, wavering, whitish 
green swaths of the prostrate hemp 
lie shimmering across the fields. 
Strongest now is the smell of it, im- 
pregnating the clothing of the men, 
spreading far throughout the air. 
So it lies a week or more drying, 
dying, till the sap is out of the stalks, 
till leaves and blossoms and earliest 
ripened or unripened fruits wither and 
drop off, giving back to the soil the 
nourishment they have drawn from 
it; the whole top being thus otherwise

stacks begin to rise. At last these 
are well built; the gates of the field 
are closed or the bars put up; wagons 
and laborers are gone; the brown 
fields stand deserted. 
One day something is gone from 
earth and sky. Autumn has come, 
season of scales and balances, when. 
the Earth, brought to judgment for 
its fruits, says, “I have done what I 
could—now let me rest!” 
Fall!—and everywhere the sights 
and sounds of falling. In the woods, 
through the cool, silvery air, the 
leaves, so indispensable once, so use- 
lessnow. Bright day after bright day, 
dripping night after dripping night; 
the never-ending filtering or gusty fall 
of leaves; the fall of walnuts, dropping 
from bare boughs with muffled boom 
into the deep grass; the fall of the 
hickory-nut, rattling noisily down 
through the scaly limbs and scattering 
its hulls among the stones of the brook 
below; the fall of buckeyes, rolling 
like balis of mahogany into: the little 
dust paths made by sheep in the hot 
months when they had sought those 
roofs of leaves; the fall of acorns, 
leaping out of their matted ‘green 
cups as they strike the rooty earth; 
the fall of red haw, persimmon, and 
pawpaw, and the odorous wild plum 
in its valley thickets; the fall of all 
seeds whatsoever of the forest, now 
made ripe in their high places and sent 
back to the ground, there to be folded 
in against the time when they shall 
arise again as the living generations; 70
-P-A-G-E-563

the homing, downward flight of the 
seeds in the many-colored woods all 
over the quiet land. 
In the fields, too, the sights and 
sounds of falling, the fall of the stand- 
ing fatness. The silent fall of the 
tobacco, to be hung head downward 
in fragrant sheds and barns. The 
felling whack of the corn-knife and 
10 the rustling of the blades, as the work- 
man gathers within his arm the top-_ 
heavy stalks and presses them into 
the bulging shock. The fall of pump- 
kins into the slow-drawn wagons, the 
shaded side of them still white with 
the morning rime. In the orchards, 
the fall of apples shaken thunderously 
down, and the piling of these in 
+ sprawling heaps near the cider mills. 
20 In the vineyards the fall of sugaring 
grapes into the baskets and the bearing 
of them to the winepress in the cool 
sunshine, where there is the late dron- 
ing of bees about the sweet: pomace. 
But of all that the earth has yielded 
with or without the farmer’s help, 
cf all that he can call his own within 
the limits of’ his land, nothing pleases 
him better than those still, brown 
30 fields where the shapely stacks stand. 
amid the deadened trees. Two months 
have passed, the workmen are at it 
again. The stacks are torn down, 
the bundles scattered, the hemp spread 
out as once before, there to lie till it 
shall be dew-retted, or rotted; there 
to suffer freeze and thaw, chill rains, 
locking frosts, and loosening snows— 
_ all the action of the elements—until 
40 the gums holding together the fila- 
ments of the fiber rot out and dis- 
solve, until the bast be separated _ 
' from the woody portion of the stalk, 
and the stalk itself be decayed and 
easily broken. 
Some day you walk across the 
spread hemp, your foot goes through 
at each step, you stoop and, taking 
several stalks, snap them readily THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
in your fingers. ‘The ends stick out 
clean apart; and lo! hanging between 
them, there it is at last—a festoon of 
wet, coarse, dark gray ribbon, wealth 
of the hemp, sail of the wild Scythian, 
‘centuries before Horace ever sang 
of him, sail of the Roman, dress of the 
Saxon and Celt, dress of the Kentucky 
pioneer. - 
The rakers reappear at intervals of 
dry weather, and draw the hemp into 
armfuls and set it up in shocks of 
convenient size, wide flared at the 
bottom, well-pressed in and bound at 
the top, so that the slanting sides 
may catch the drying sun and the 
sturdy base resist the strong winds. 
And now the fields are as the dark 
brown camps of armies—each shock 
asoldier’s tent. Yet not dark always; 
at times snow-covered; and then the 
white tents gleam for miles in the 
winter sunshine—the snow-white tents 
of the camping hemp. 
Throughout the winter and on into 
early spring, as days may be warm 
or the hemp dry, the breaking con- 
tinues. At each nightfall, cleaned and 
baled, it is hauled on wagon-beds or 
slides to the barns or the hemphouses, 
where it is weighed for the work and 
wages of the day.. 50

Last of all, the brakes having been ~

to run from gray heap to gray heap,

PLOWING ON A WHEAT RANCH 
Frank Norris 
The evening before, when the fore- 
man had blown -his whistle at six 
o’clock, the long line of plows had 
halted upon the instant, and the 
drivers, unharnessing their teams, had 
taken them back to the division barns 
—leaving the plows as they were, in 
the furrows. But an hour after day- 
light the next morning the work was 
resumed. After breakfast, Vanamee, 10 
riding one horse and leading the others, 
had returned to the line of plows, to- 
gether with the other drivers. Now he 
was busy harnessing the team. At 
the division blacksmith shop—tem- 
porarily put up—he had been obliged 
to wait while one of his lead horses was 
shod, and he had thus been delayed 
quite five minutes. Nearly all the 
other teams were harnessed, the drivers 20 
on their seats, waiting for the fore- 
man’s signal. 
“All ready here?” inquired the fore- 
man, driving up to Vanamee’s team in 
his buggy. . 
“All ready, sir,” answered Vanamee.

He climbed to his seat, shaking out

him at the landscape inundated with 
the brilliant glow of the early morning. 
The day was fine. Since the first 
rain of the season, there had been no 
other. Now the sky was without a 
cloud, pale blue, delicate, luminous, 
scintillating with morning. The great 
brown earth turned a huge flank. to 
it, exhaling the moisture of the early 
dew. The atmosphere, washed clean 40 
of dust and mist, was translucent as 
crystal. Far off to the east, the hills 
on the other side of Broderson Creek 
stood out against the pallid saffron of 
the horizon as flat and as sharply out- 
+ lined as if pasted on the sky. The

campanile of the ancient Mission of 
San Juan seemed as fine as frost work. 
All about between the horizons, the 
carpet of the land unrolled itself to 
infinity. But now it was no longer 
parched with heat, cracked and warped 
by a merciless sun, powdered with 
dust. The rain had done its work; 
not a clod that was not swollen with 
fertility, not a fissure that did not 
exhale the sense, of fecundity. 
The plows, thirty-five in number, 
cach drawn by its team of ten, stretched 
in an interminable line, nearly a 
quarter of a mile in length, behind 
and ahead of Vanamee. They were 
arranged, as it were, en echelon, not 
in filé—not one directly behind the 
other, but each succeeding plow its 
own width farther in the field than 
Each of these 
: plows held five shares, so that when 
17.° en echelon, a French military term meaning liter- 
‘vgily, in the form of steps. the entire company was in motion, 
one hundred and seventy-five fur- 
rows were made at the same instant. 
At a distance, the plows resembled a 
great column of field artillery. Each 
driver was in his place, his glance al- 
ternating between his horses and the 
foreman nearest at hand. Other 
foremen, in their buggies or buck- 
boards, were at intervals along the 
line, like battery lieutenants. An- 
nixter himself, on horseback, in boots 
and campaign hat, a cigar in his 
teeth, overlooked the scene. 
The division superintendent, on the 
opposite side of the line, -galloped 
past to a position at the head. For a 
long moment there was a silence. A 
sense of preparedness ran from end to 
end of the column. All things were 
ready, each man in his place. The 
day’s work was about to begin. 
Suddenly, from a distance at the 
head of the line came the shrill trilling

of a whistle. At once. the foreman 
nearest Vanamee repeated it, at the 
same time turning down the line, and 
waving one arm. ‘The signal was 
repeated, whistle answering whistle, 
till the sounds lost themselves in the 
distance. At once the line of plows 
Jost its immobility, moving forward, 
getting slowly under way, the horses 
straining in the traces. A prolonged 
movement rippled from team to team, 
disengaging in its passage a multitude 
of sounds—the click of buckles, the 
creak of straining leather, the sub- 
dued clash of machinery, the cracking 
of whips, the deep breathing of nearly 
four hundred horses, the abrupt com- 
mands and cries of the drivers, and, 
last of all, the prolonged, soothing 
murmur of the thick brown earth 
turning steadily from the multitude of 
advancing shares. 
The plowing thus commenced, con- 
tinued. The sun rose higher. Steadily 
the hundred iron hands kneaded and 
furrowed and stroked the brown humid 
earth, the hundred iron teeth bit deep - 
into the Titan’s flesh. Perched on his 
seat, the moist, living reins slipping 
and tugging in his hands, Vanamee, in 
the midst of this steady confusion of 
constantly varying sensation, sight 
interrupted by sound, sound mingling 
with sight, on this swaying, vibrating” 
seat quivering with the prolonged 
thrill of the earth, lapsed to a sort of 
pleasing numbness, in a sense, hypno- 
tized by the weaving maze of things in 
which he found himself involved. To 
keep his team at an even, regular gait, 
maintaining the precise interval, to 
run his furrows as closely as possible 
to those already made by the plow in 
front—~this for the moment was the 
entire sum of his duties. But while 
one part of his brain, alert and watch- 
ful, took cognizance of these matters,

stupefied with the long monotony of 
the affair. 
The plowing, now in full swing, 
enveloped him in a vague, slow-moving 
whirl of things. Underneath him was 
the jarring, jolting, trembling machine; 
not a clod was turned, not‘an obstacle 
encountered, that he did not receive 
the swift impression of it through all 
his body, the very friction of the damp 
soil, sliding incessantly from the shiny 
surface of the shares, seemed to re- 
produce itself in his: finger-tips and 
along the back of his head. He heard 
the horse-hoofs by the myriads crtish- 
ing down easily, deeply, into the loam, 
the prolonged clinking of trace-chains, 
the working of the smooth brown 
flanks in the harness, the clatter of 
wooden hames, the champing of bits, 
the click of iron shoes against pebbles, 
the brittle stubble of the surface 
ground crackling and snapping as the 
furrows turned, the sonorous, steady 
breaths. wrenched from the deep, 
laboring chests, strap-bound, shining 
with sweat, and all along the line the 
voices of the men talking to the horses. 
Everywhere there were visions of 
glossy brown backs, straining, heav-— 
ing, swollen with muscle; harness 
streaked with specks of froth, broad, 
cup-shaped hoofs, heavy with brown 
loam, men’s faces red with tan, blue 
overalls spotted with axle-grease; 
muscled hands, the knuckles whitened 
in their grip on the reins, and through 
it all the ammoniacal smell of the 
horses, the bitter reek of perspiration 
of beasts and men, the aroma of warm 
leather, the scent of dead stubble— 
and stronger and more penetrating 
than everything else, the heavy, ener- 
vating odor of the upturned, living 
earth. 
At intervals, from the top, of one of . 
the rare, low swells of the land, 
Vanamee overlooked a wider horizon. — 
     
-P-A-G-E-567

On the other divisions of Quien Sabe 
the same work was in progress. Oc- 
casionally he could see another column 
of plows in the adjoining division— 
sometimes so close at hand -that the 
subdued murmur of its movements 
reached his ear; sometimes so distant 
that it resolved itself into a long, 
brown streak upon the gray of the 
10 ground. Farther off to the west on 
the Osterman ranch other columns 
came and went, and, once, from the 
crest of the highest swell on his divi- 
sion, Vanamee caught a distant glimpse 
of the Broderson ranch. There, too, 
moving specks indicated that the 
plowing was under way. And farther 
away still, far off there beyond the 
fine line of the horizons, over the 
20 curve of the globe, the shoulder of the 
earth, he knew were other ranches, 
and beyond these others, and beyond 
these still others, the immensities mul- 
tiplying to infinity. 
Everywhere throughout the great 
San Joaquin, unseen and unheard, a 
thousand plows up-stirred the land, 
tens of thousands of shares clutched 
deep into the warm, moist soil. 
* * * 
30 From time to time the gang in which 
- Vanamee worked halted on the signal 
from foreman or overseer. The horses 
came to a standstill, the vague clamor 
of the work lapsed away. Then the 
minutes passed. The whole work hung 
suspended. All up and down the line 
one demanded what had happened. 
The division superintendent galloped 
past, perplexed and anxious. For the 
40 moment, one of the plows was out of 
order, a bolt had slipped, a lever re- 
fused to work, or a machine had be- 
come immobilized in heavy ground, or 
a horse had lamed himself. Once, 
even, toward noon, an entire plow was 
taken out of the line, so out of gear 
that a messenger had to be sent to the THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
division forge to summon the ma- 
chinist. 
Annixter had disappeared. He had 
ridden farther on to the other divi- 
sions of his ranch, to watch the work 
in progress there. At twelve o’clock, 
according to his orders, all the divi- 
sion superintendents put themselves 
in communication with him by means 
of the telephone wires that connected 
each of the division houses, report- 
ing the condition of the work, the 
number of acres covered, the pros- 
pects of each plow traversing its daily 
average of twenty miles. 
At half-past twelve, Vanamee and 
the rest of the drivers ate their lunch 
in the field, the tin buckets having 
been distributed to them that morn- 
ing after breakfast. But in the eve- 
ning, the routine of the previous day 
was repeated, and Vanamee,: unhar- 
nessing his team, riding one horse 
and leading the others, returned to 
the division barns and bunk-house. 
It was between six and seven o’clock. 
The half hundred men of the gang 
threw themselves upon the supper the 
Chinese cooks had set out in the shed 
of the eating-house, long as a bowling 
alley, unpainted, crude, the seats 
benches, the table covered with oil- 
cloth. Overhead a half dozen kero- 
sene lamps flared and smoked. 
The table was taken as if by assault; 
the clatter of iron knives upon the 
tin plates was as the reverberation 
of hail upon a metal roof. The 
plowmen rinsed their throats with 
great draughts of wine, and, their 
elbows wide, their foreheads flushed, 
resumed the attack upon the beef 
and bread, eating as though they 
would never have enough. All up 
and down the long table, where the 
kerosene lamps reflected themselves 
deep in the oilcloth cover, one heard 
the incessant sounds of mastication, 
and saw the uninterrupted move- 60

ment of great jaws. At every mo- 
ment one or another of the men de- 
manded a fresh portion of beef, 
another pint of wine, another half- 
loaf of bread. For upwards of an 
hour the gang ate. It was no longer 
a supper. It was a veritable barbe- 
cue, a crude and primitive feasting, 
barbaric, Homeric. 
But in all this scene Vanamee saw 
nothing repulsive. Presley would 
have abhorred it—this feeding of the 
People, this gorging of the human 
animal, eager for its meat. Vanamee, 
simple, uncomplicated,. living so close 
to Nature and the rudimentary life, 
understood its significance. He knew 
very well that within a short half-hour 
after this meal the men would throw 
themselves down in their bunks to 
sleep without moving, inert and stupe- 
fied with fatigue, till the morning. 
Work, food, and sleep, all life reduced 
to its bare essentials, uncomplex, 
honest, healthy. They were strong, 
these men, with the strength of the 
soil they worked, in touch with the 
essential things, back again to the 
starting point of civilization, coarse, 
vital, real, and sane. 
For a brief moment immediately 
after the meal, pipes were lit, and 
the air grew thick with fragrant to- 
bacco smoke. On a corner of the 
dining-room table a game of poker 
was begun. One of the drivers, a 
Swede, produced an accordion; a 
group on the steps of the bunk- 
house listened, with alternate gravity 
and shouts of laughter, to the ac- 
knowledged story-teller of the gang. 
But soon the men beganeto turn in, 
stretching themselves at full length 
on the horse-blankets in the rack- 
like bunks. The sounds of heavy 
breathing increased steadily, lights 
were put out, and before the after- 
glow had faded from the sky, the 
gang was asleep. 559

Less than a hundred and fifty years 
ago forests of lofty pine stretched from 
the shores of Lake Superior west to 
the barren plains of the Dakotas. 
Here in the long cold winter roamed 
wolf and deer; and over all the coun- 
try the deep snow settled, a thick soft 
blanket that bowed down the dark 
green branches of the lofty pines and 
drifted deep in the hollows between 
the hills. Indians inhabited the coun- 
try. Through the ice they fished, or 
they tracked the wild animals in the 
forests. .A few white men came occa- 
sionally in canoes up through the 
Great Lakes from Montreal, to trade 
food and gunpowder and clothing for 
beaver skins. But. the Indian still 
reigned supreme, enduring famine and 
privation in a land whose riches of 
mine and forest he was not able to 
use, riches that he would have gladly 
traded for a few red blankets or powder 
for his gun.- : 
Then, beginning about a century 
ago, came the white men in increasing 
numbers. Up the lakes they sailed in
-P-A-G-E-569
560 THE WORLD IN 
small brigs and schooners or worked 
their way along the shores in heavy- 
laden bark canoes. Some traveled 
across the country where now lie the 
states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, 
bringing their goods and families in 
heavy wagons, and many of them 
turned north at the foot of Lake Michi- 
gan and pushed their way up through 
av Wisconsin toward the pine forests of 
Minnesota. 
With the coming of the white man 
came the need for lumber. Villages 
began to dot the prairies, and towns 
sprawled along the shores of lakes and 
rivers. Wood was needed, and soon 
‘the axes of the lumbermen rang in the 
dark pine forests, and the screeching 
of the sawmills broke the silence that 
20 had known only the how! of the wolf 
pack or. the laughter of the lake loons. 
Swiftly the forests disappeared and the 
' farms of the settlers marked the clear: 
ings, and cattle grazed between the 
half-burned stumps of the giant pine 
trees. 
Then, well within the memory of 
living men, came a great discovery. 
For many years iron had been mined 
30 in Pennsylvania and other eastern 
states; but now it was found that 
beneath the former forests of northern 
Minnesota lay deep beds of rich red 
ore, a treasure of even greater worth 
than the forests or the farm lands. 
Soon the hillsides were scarred with 
great ted gashes where steam shovels 
tore open the surface soil to disclose 
the hidden ore. From the western end 
40 of Lake Superior railroads pushed their 
: gleaming tracks of steel to the “iron 
range,” as this region came to be called, 
and long trains of cars heavy with red 
ore rumbled through the waste burned- 
over forest lands to the great docks at 
Duluth and Superior, where deep- 
bellied steamships waited to carry the 
ore to the steel mills at Gary far down 
at the foot of Lake Michigan, or WHICH WE LIVE 
through the Detroit River down to 
Lake Erie and thence by rail to the 
mills at Bethlehem and Pittsburgh. 
In his deerhide shirt, coonskin cap, 
and moccasins the explorer had pre- 
pared the way for his brother the lum- 
berman; and in his turn the lumberman 
leveled the forests of pine and cleared 
the land where now the gangs of steam- 
shovel men scoop out the iron ore. 
But there are other workers who must 
contribute their toil before the red ore 
of Minnesota can be transformed into 
tails of steel or plates for the hulls of 
ships. There is a team-play that is 
required, there must be a codperation 
of many industries, in order that there 
may be brought together the many 
elements which are needed to make the 
finished ships, or machines, or build- 
ings that serve the needs of all of us. 
But iron ore cannot become the iron 
or steel that we know without the heat 
of coal, and for coal our modern in- 
dustry depends on the miner who toils 
in the dark mine far beneath the pleas- 
ant surface of the earth. 
Our Brotuer in THE CoaL Mine 
Deep down in the strata of the 
earth’s crust lie beds of coal. Millions 
of years ago they were deposited there, 
swamps of rotting vegetation, like the 
peat bogs of Ireland. Then as the 
ages passed, the rock layers formed 
deep above the bogs, pressing them 
with tremendous weight into beds of 
slowly forming coal. Deeper grew the 
layers of rock; slowly the coal became 
harder, and into the crevasses in the 
rock the oils and gases squeezed from 
the coal were stored away. Today we 
know where lie these beds of coal, for 
all over the country engineers have 
probed deep into the earth with search- 
ing drills to discover what may be 
beneath. 
Coal mines are much alike. In 
Pennsylvania, Illinois, or Washington 7

Ss 8 2 3 BROTHERS IN INDUSTRY 
the methods of mining are much the 
same. High above the shaft mouth 
in the flat lands of the middle west 
rises the tower of the tipple, a skeleton 
structure of blackened steel. In its 
peak great wheels are turning, and 
from these wheels slim, stranded cords 
of steel hang down the black mouth 
of the shaft to lower and lift the loads 
of coal. Black are the miners, black 
as the darkness of the deep galleries 
and tunnels beneath the sun-swept 
fields, for their faces are smeared with 
coal dust and their working clothes 
are black with it. Their uniform is a 
coal-blackened suit, their insignia a 
tiny lamp on the brim of their pit cap; 
in their hands they carry their tools, 
the pick and the shovel of their trade. 
Blood red are the faces and hands and 
clothes of the shovel gang on the iron 
range; red is their color. But black is 
the uniform of the miner of coal. 
The day shift is waiting in the 
shadow of the tipple for the hoisting 
engineer to lower them five hundred 
feet to the underworld, where for long 
hours they will labor. Jack Davis and 
Tony Petrovitch are talking as they 
wait. Their faces are white and clean, 
for they have just breakfasted with 
their families in their little houses in 
the town near by. They have dinner 
pails in their hands and they are talk- 
ing about the same things that the 
iron miners talk about and that you 
and I, as well, find interesting subjects 
for conversation. The man-hoist 
slides up from ,the shaft mouth, a_ 
rough elevator swung by the slender 
ropes of steel that wind over the 
grooved wheels in the tipple tower and 
coil smoothly about the drum beside 
the hoisting engine at the shaft mouth. 
They have lighted their lamps, and 
the tiny flames gleam like fireflies 
caught in their caps as they step on 
board the skip. A dozen men are 
crowded on it. The hoisting engineer 561 
pulls his lever toward him. Swiftly 
the steel cable unreels from the rum- 
bling drum. With a sudden dropping 
feeling the man-hoist speeds down the 
shaft—the sunshine and the pleasant 
sky are gone. It is blacker than night, 
and more than ever like small yellow 
stars gleam the lights in the miners’ 
caps, throwing strange sharp shadows 
over their faces. ~ : 
Down rushes the skip faster and 
faster. There is a pressure in the 
men’s ears and they swallow to relieve 
it. Two hundred feet; three, four 
hundred; then softly the speed lessens 
and the black wet walls of the shaft 
that have seemed to be streaming 
upward become stationary. The side 
of the shaft opens; a long tunnel with 
occasional ‘electric lights fades away 
into the blackness—it is the mine. 
Like a vast underground city the 
tunnels pierce the coal seams. On 
either hand the walls of coal gleam 
like fractured glass in the light of the 
pit lamps. Above, the gray slate roof 
is supported by sturdy beams of rough- 
hewn oak; like a long avenue of 
branchless trees the props line the 
tunnels supporting the roof beams. 
Down each tunnel the steel rails of the 
tracks glisten. Far off a light appears, 
the headlight of an electric locomotive. 
Behind it a string of low, square cars 
grind along the track. Above, the 
trolley of the locomotive strikes sput- 
tering blue and yellow sparks from the 
low-hung wire. The train passes, cars 
piled high with coal, on its way to the 
shaft mouth, and there is again silence, 
a silence so intense that small sounds : 
usually unnoticed become audible. 
Far in the mine, a mile perhaps from 
the shaft, miners are loading coal into 
the waiting cars. Last night the “shot 
firers” blasted down with charges of 
black powder the coal at the end of 
each room or tunnel, and today Jack 
and. Tony will shovel up the shattered

: coal and load their empties. When the 
car is full, an old mule will drag it 
' down the track to the main line, where 
°. 
20 the electric locomotive. will pick it 
up on its circuit, and then the old mule 
will drag up another empty for them 
to fill. 
The air is sweet in the mine, for at 
the head of the air shaft a giant fan 
pumps down a steady current to feed 
the lungs of the miners and sweep the 
tunnels clean of the poisonous gases 
that would otherwise settle down from 
the crannies in the rock and destroy 
the mine in a burst of overwhelming 
flamé. Sometimes such accidents oc- 
cur. Sometimes the gas grows thick 
and 4 miner alone at his work sinks 
suddenly unconscious to. the black 
floor to die unless help comes speedily. 
Often, too, great slivers of rock drop 
suddenly from the roof and crush out 
the life of the man who may be beneath. 
Death, when it comes, comes quickly; 
brave hearts are necessary, hearts that 
know no fear of sudden danger and 
that cannot be intimidated by the long 
hours of labor in the silent blackness. 
Up in the sunshine of the world the 
loaded cars of coal appear with clock- 
like regularity from the black square 
of the shaft mouth. High into the 
tipple tower they are carried and their 
contents there dumped into waiting 
bins; then the empty cars sink again 
into the dark opening and disappear. 
From the bins the coal slides down 
over shaking screens which separate 
the various sizes. Alongside the 
screens, boys, blackened with’ coal 
’. dust, pick from the sliding torrent of 
coal the bits of slate and stone that 
have been mixed with it in the mine. 
Then through the screens the coal falls 
into other bins, the fine coal first, then 
larger sizes, and finally the great lumps 
that have passed over all the screen 
openings. 
Beneath the’ tipple are railroad WHICH WE LIVE 
tracks and trains of waiting cars. ‘The 50 
wind swirls about them black and 
visible with dust clouds. Down roars 
the coal. This is its final journey. 
Perhaps this long train will carry coal 
to the steel mills. There the red ore 
of Minnesota and the ebon fuel of 
Illinois will meet in necessary union 
that steel may be made. With clank- 
ing couplings the loaded train slides 
out from beneath the tipple. Far 
down, five hundred feet below, the 
miners are working. Far off, a thou- 
sand miles away, the steam-shovel 
gangs are scooping up the red iron 
from the carved hillsides. Unconscious 
of each other they are working to a 
common end. And so we come to the 
next worker in this group of men who 
toil to give us the things we need. 
Our Broruer or THE SteEL Mini 
The steel mills edge the lake front. 7 
Beyond the ragged skyline of the roof 
and chimneys the blue water gleams 
and sparkles, but near the shore the 
water is roiled and stained a dull brick | 
color, the color of iron ore. In from 
the lake a long steamer slowly steams. 
She is as long as a city block and her 
funnel is far aft, almost above her 
churning screws. Forward the long 
deep hull is filled with iron ore. She 
tides low in the water ‘with the weight 
of her cargo, as slowly she nears the 
shore and feels for the channel. At 
half speed she enters the narrow water 
and then glides with reversing screws 
to her place beside the dock. On her 
decks her crew greet the land, strong, 
agile men who have worked her down 
from Lake Superior, through miles of 
inland waters, with her tons of ore for 
the waiting steel mills. 
‘Above the ore dock is a skeleton 
frame of steel. High in its structure 
are tiny cabs that slide back and forth 
out over the open hatches of the ship. 
Here men operate the grab buckets,

huge hands of steel that swoop down 
on wire cables and snatch a ton or two 
of red ore from the, ship. Up they 
soar, the ore fast in their clenched 
fists, and then beneath the traveling 
cabs they are borne inland to release 
the ore on the great red pile that ties 
behind the dock. Behind the piles of 
ore are piles of coal. Here ore and fuel 
meet, and from their meeting will be 
born another product—steel. 
The blast furnaces, in which the 
ore is melted and purified, are ready. 
Within their circular walls the furnace 
men pile in alternating layers the red 
ore, white limestone, and steel-gray 
coke, or coal from which the gas has 
been removed. The furnace is filled 
and closed. It is lighted. In the 
intense heat of the burning coke the 
red ore melts and runs down like water 
through the limestone layers, which 
catch and hold the impurities in the 
ore. Outside, the men are waiting to        From an etching by Joseph Pennell 
draw off the liquid iron. It is ready— 
from the bottom of the furnace gushes 
a sudden stream of molten iron. 
Swiftly it flows through channels that 
have been cut in a great bed of sand. 
Slowly the liquid metal cools to dull 
gray “pigs,” or stout bars, of iron. 
From beneath the furnace a string of 
small cars jerks out along a narrow 
track. On each car are great cups, 
each filled with liquid iron. They are 
going to the mills for further treat- 
ment, for from liquid iron steel is 
made, a stronger and more useful 
material. 
Within one of the great shed-like 
buildings of corrugated i iron there is a 
sudden gloom in contrast to the sun- 
light of the outer world. High up in 
the dark roof the yellow light slants 
down in dusty rays through glassless 
windows. Far as the eye can see, the 
vast room stretches, a huge gloomy 
room that reeks with gaseous heat.

Along the side of the building are the 
hearths, big brick furnaces with heavy 
doors, and from chinks in their faces 
shines here and there a light of such 
intensity that its brilliancy pains the 
naked eye. 
Through the gloom move the steel 
workers—they are men who are broth- 
ers in labor of the steam-shovel work- 
ers in the Iron Range, brothers in 
industry of the grimy miners of the 
coal fields—interdependent are they 
all, for without the steel mills there 
would be no need for the red ore of 
Mesaba; without the steel mill there 
would be less need for coal; and the 
steel mills would stand idle with cold 
hearths if the miners of coal or iron 
ceased from their labors. Strong men 
are the steel workers. They are men 
trained by their work to move deftly 
and with unerring surety carry out 
their perilous handlings of the fluid 
metal. They are men with muscles 
of sinuous strength, muscles that you 
can see rippling beneath the soiled skin 
of naked arms and breasts. Their 
overalls are stained with the sweat 
and grime of their labor; their faces 
are strained with the anxiety to per- 
form their arduous duties. 
The train of cars bearing the ladles 
of molten iron rumbles into the hearth 
room. With a blinding glare of light 
the doors of a hearth are flung open. 
Peering through their blue glass 
goggles, and shielding their faces with 
their hands, the men carry out their 
perilous work. From a high suspended 
crane in the blackness of the roof giant 
hooks on cords of steel seize the ladle 
from the flat cars and swing it to the 
hearth-mouth. There is a cascade of 
fire, a shower of sparks white as light— 
like a cataract of falling stars the tor- 
rent of iron floods into the hearth. 
From piles beside the doors of the 
hearth the workers cast great lumps of 
15. Mesaba, the Mesaba Range in Minnesota. WHICH WE LIVE 
x 
rich ore into the hearth-mouth. Then 
the doors are closed suddenly; there is 
a sense of sudden blackness—the iron 
is how undergoing its transformation 
into steel. 
In the semi-darkness a line of seem- 
ingly endless hearths, where iron is 
cooking into steel, stretches off into 
the distance. On the other side be- 
hind the hearths, a “heat” is ready to 
be “tapped,” a hearth, or “heat,” in 
which the ‘molten metal has been 
transformed to steel and is ready to be 
“tapped,” or drawn off.. From the 
blackness above, another crane swings 
down an empty. ladle, a giant cup in 
which men might stand unseen. Slow- 
ly but surely it swings down into 
place beneath a vent in the rear of the 
hearth. The’tap is opened. With a 
fountain flood of liquid fire the steel 
gushes like water into the waiting 
ladle. In the flare of light the vast 
room becomes suddenly illuminated. 
White sparks leap comet-like high 
above the ladle’s rim. Then abruptly 
the tap is closed and the slender cords 
of steel lift the ladle, still sputtering 
sparks of fire, and it is borne swinging 
down the long dark room to the place 
where the steel will be poured into the 
waiting molds to cool into gray ingots. 
In another vast room the ingots, 
cherry red with heat, move skimming 
along the floor, propelled by countless 
rollers. This is the “blooming mill,” 
where the ingots of metal are rolled 
into the desired shapes. The air 
rumbles with the thunder of the ma- 
chinery. Back and forth roll the glow- 
ing ingots; back and forth, each time 
passing between long rolls of steel that 
compress the malleable metal with 
each passage. Slowly the ingots 
change in shape; thinner and thinner 
they become, until at last the log of 
steel has become transformed into a 
long thin graying strip, a hundred feet 
in length. Once again the long strip

rumbles along the floor and then a 
knife, with even strokes, chops the 
long bars of metal into equal pieces of 
manageable size and weight. 
Through all this maze of swiftly 
passing metal, whose touch would kill 
or maim for life, the workers move, 
strange dark figures that direct the 
ruddy bars. and watch with trained 
eyes the passage of each piece of steel. 
In other mighty buildings other men 
are working. Here the billets, or 
rough logs, of steel still soft with heat 
are passed through other rolls and from 
the lips of the rolls the steel emerges 
compressed into its final shape of angle 
_ bar or broad flat plate. a Ss 3S From the iron range has come the 
ore. With coke, baked from the coal 
that other men have dug far beneath 
the surface of the earth, the ore has 
been refined and melted into liquid 
form. With gas released from the coal 
in the cooking process the liquid iron 
has been superheated into steel. Miner 
of coal or iron and steel-mill worker, 
all have contributed their vital parts 
to the making of the great gray piles 
of steel that are stacked beside the 
rails. From the mine and the open 
hearth have come the rails of steel 
that bind our cities into one; structural 
steel that carries high the city sky- 
scraper; plates that sheathe the huge 
bilges of mighty ships... Here is the 
steel for peace and war; steel for 
plowshares, automobiles, tools, and 
boilers; steel for guns, shells, turrets, 
and battle cruisers. Who made this 
steel that is so necessary? The coal 
miner in the gaseous pit, the shovel 
man in the iron mine, the sweating 
giants peering through blue glass 
goggles before the hearths of the steel 
mills; they gave us steel—steel for its 
many uses, steel and coal for the 
mighty train, steel for another group 
of men who join in the great plan of 
helpful labor: 565

side him the country seems to flow past 
as his tremendous machine of steel

is a sudden roar, and the engineer 
glances back at the bridge that bas 
already disappeared in the night be- 
hind. Far down the track the green 
lights of the semaphore give assurance 
of safety. Behind him the light from

In the rocking cab of the engine the 
fireman feeds his fire with the gleam- 
ing black lumps of coal from the mine. 
Coal is the fuel, coal torn from the 
depths of earth by blackened miners 
that you and I may ride from place to 
place and that freights of food and 
clothes and things of varied usefulness 
may be transported for our health 
and happiness. Steel is the material 
of which this fleeting monster is built; 
steel are the cars, strong enduring 
steel that cannot burn or splinter if 
wreck is our misfortune. Steel are the 50

- rails which bear us. Steel; wrought in 
10 the fiery hearths from the red ore of 
. the mines, by men whose labors have 
made possible this mighty train. 
Transportation! Think you for a 
moment of this word. A hundred 
milijon people live by its magic con- 
tact. Gone are the days of lumbering 
ox trains, the slowly-towed canal boat, 
or the heavy-sailing river craft. In 
frigid cars the fruits of California are 
carried across the land that we who 
live in snowy Maine may breakfast on 
oranges that but two weeks ago hung 
on the deep green trees. By train are 
borne the materials of which our houses 
. are built, our clothes are made, our 
stomachs fed. Without their unfail- 
ing service cities would starve. With 
a mazing skein of tracks men have 
united our vast country into one com- 
munity. And we may exchange the 
wares of the eastern seaboard for the 
produce of our western coast with 
greater ease than a hundred years ago 
our great - great - grandfathers could 
trade from farm to some town near by. 
Brothers all in industry and in kin- 
dred interest are the workers who 
make possible these magic aspects of 
the modern world—and behind the 
workers who labor with their hands 
and the strength of thigh and back and 
arm stand those other workers who 
with brain and pencil plan and exe- 
‘cute the high-visioned schemes that 
40 make practical the nation’s industries 
interdependent all, for each of us 
lives by our neighbors’ work, and we 
by our small help contribute. 
High over the roofs of the city the 
carved cornice of the skyscraper cuts 
the blue of the sky. From the lofty 
tower a flag throws its crimson stripes 
and azure field of stars against the sky. 
Steel-ribbed structure, planned by 
quiet-eyed engineers and sketched by 
patient draftsmen, you too could not 
exist save by the work of men who WHICH WE LIVE 
delve in coal and ore and those who 5 
breathe the stifling heat of. steel-mill 
hearth. 
Far down in the earth the deep-dug 
foundations firmly rest on bed rock— 
from ‘concrete footholds rise the frames 
of steel, up fifty stories above the 
crowded streets. The rattle of the 
riveters reverberates above the roar of 
truck and street car. - On slender 
beams of steel the structural workers 6 
perch, firm-footed as birds on the dead 
limb of a lofty pine tree. Up from the 
loaded truck the steel cables lift a 
dozen tons of steel—high they swing 
secure above the street. Red hot the 
rivets fly through the air, caught a 
story up and driven home, steel ham- 
mer against bolt of steel. 
Whence came this giant structure 
that will soon house the population 
of as many people as might fill a coun- 
try town? From mine and mill; over 
rail of steel transported; by thousands 
of silent workers it has been construct- 
ed; by men each of whom has played his 
part in its construction without per- 
haps the gladness that might come 
could he have seen the final product of 
his work. 
From their lofty places on the skele- 
ton frame of the New York City sky- 
scraper the workers look down over 
the roofs of the great city. Far below 
in the cafions of the street, the street 
cars move like beetles in a line. The 
swarms of moving jots of black are 
men and women who crowd the side- 
walks, Beyond the roofs is the sudden 
open breadth of blue water. Along the 
shore the wharves push out, shed- 
housed, and between is the green 
water of the slips where ships may tie 
up alongside the docks and discharge 
their priceless cargoes. Here, about 
the ships and wharves, are still other 
men whose labor helps to carry on the 
interdependent task of modern life.

Our Brorser or THE STEEL-cLAD 
Sures 
Once the ships along this water 
front carried a forest of slim masts 
and branching spars. Those were the 
days of wooden ships; those were the 
days before steel came. Their mighty 
wings of canvas bore them from port - 
to port—but today coal is the motive 
power, and iron hulls with stocky 
smoking funnels rest where once was 
tied the clipper, bark, or brigantine. 
In the shipyards the quaint steel 
frame of a battleship is slowly rising 
above the ways—two years or three, 
or even more may pass before she will 
float with her long guns peering from 
her turrets and our Country’s flag 
snapping bright against the sky high 
above her deck. She, too, is a product 
of mine and mill, but she is oil driven. 
Her fuel comes from the deep-driven 
well, the product of: 
Ovr Brotuer or THE Orn WELL 
What is this oil that is playing so 
important a part in the industrial life 
of the country? Deep in the rock 
strata where coal was laid down those 
millions of years ago are lakes of min- 
eral oil. For less than a century has 
man known of its existence; yet today 
it enters everywhere into our daily 
lives, Down hundreds of feet through 
the solid rock the oil men sink their 
drill. Through small, deep tubes of 
steel that line the drill hole the oil is 
led to the earth’s surface and then the 
crude and heavy oil is refined and sep- 
arated by other workers into countless 
elements of inestimable worth. Gaso- 
line to drive our motors comes from 
it; oil to lubricate the wheels of indus- 
try and defeat the clutching hands of 
friction, crude oil to drive the giant 
ship, highly refined oil for medicines, 
and all ‘the other precious substances 
from which we make our dyes—more 567. 
than a fuel it is; a magic substance that 
by the wizardry. of chemistry is so 
transformed and put to work to serve 
man’s many needs. 
Brorners Au In Inpustry 
There are men’s lives tied up in 
everything we wear or eat or use. 
Lives are they like yours and mine; 
lives of men whom we would be glad 
to know and thank for their great 
work, their contribution to our daily 
life. We cannot really know. them all. 
‘The sailors on the lake ore boats can- 
‘not know their brother miners of the 
range or the blackened diggers in the 
coal fields of Illinois. Nor can we 
know them, you and I. Still we can 
think of them whenever we ride upon, 
‘a train and trust our lives to the 
watchful eyes that guard us on our 
way—we can think of them in the 
black coal lump that warms the house 
or feeds the fires in some vast factory 
—we can think of them in the mighty 
ship or towering building. Brothers 
all are we; brothers in industry. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
1, This selection emphasizes the value of 
codperation; in what industries does the author 
point out mutual dependence? Describe the 
iron region of Lake Superior as it appeared at 
the time the Indians inhabited the country; 
describe it as it appears today. What discov- 
ery led to the change? 
2, What codperation is needed to transform 
iron ore into steel rails or plates? Account for 
the deposits of coal, and name states that pro- 
duce coal in large quantities. What do you 
learn from this selection about the coal mine 
and the miner? 
3. Tell briefly how iron is unloaded from 
the ore boats, Have you ever seen the unload- 
ing at the dock? What picture of work in the 
blast furnace do you gain from this selection? 
Why does the author call the men who work 
in the steel mills brothers to those who operate 
the steam shovels on the Iron Range and to 
those who work in the coal mines? How are 
we’ indebted to these workers? How can we 
show that we appreciate the codperation of the 
workers?

4. What is the relation of the railroad and 
the steamship to the coal and iron industries? 
What is the relation of all these industries to 
the skyscrapers in great cities? What is their 
relation to shipbuilding? What is the impor- 
tance of the oil well? Name regions that pro- 
duce oil in quantity. Tell what you know of 
the sources and uses of oil.

BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AUTHORS 
Aaassiz, Louis (1807-1873), naturalist and 
geologist, was born in Switzerland. He came 
to America in 1846, and was so pleased with 
the opportunities the United States offered 
that he decided to settle here permanently., A 
year later he was appointed professor of zodlogy 
and geology at Harvard University. -In 1871 
he located on the island of Penikese, in Buz- 
zard’s Bay; this island, together with fifty 
thousand dollars, had been presented to him 
for the purpose of endowing a school of natural 
science devoted to the study of marine zodlogy. 
Longfellow’ s poem, “The Fiftieth Birthday of 
Agassiz,” was read by the author at a dinner 
given to Agassiz by the Saturday: Club of 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1857. 
Aten, James Lann'(1849- _), is a native 
of Kentucky. He was graduated from Tran- 
sylvania University and became professor of 
higher English and Latin in Bethany College, 
West Virginia. He now gives his entire atten- 
tion to literature. His home is in New York 
City, 
Batt, Sir Ropsert (1840-1913), astronomer 
and mathematician, was born in Dublin. He 
was graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, in 
7861. Later, he was professor of astronomy 
in the University of Dublin, and in 1892 be- 
came professor of astronomy and geology at 
Cambridge and director of the Cambridge Ob- 
servatory. Among his works are Experimental 
Mechanics, The Story of the Heavens, Starland, 
and In Starry Realms, 
Barriz, James M. (1860- ), British 
author and journalist, was educated at Edin- 
burgh University. He is best known for his 
novels and dramas. Barrie’s gifts of humor 
and pathos are well shown in A Window in 
Thrums, a book that portrays the life of his 
native village. Peter Pan is one of his best- 
known dramas. 
Brraes, L. B. R., is President of Radcliffe 
College and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences of Harvard University. He is the 
author of a number of books, among them 
School, College, and Character. 
Browning, Rosert (1812-1889). Next to 
Tennyson, the most famous English poet of 
the Victorian era; born in a suburb of London; 
early education directed by his father, a man 
of wide knowledge and a lover of the classics. 
In his youth, Browning was influenced ,by Byron and Shelley, ‘and like them acquired 
. a love for Italy that became a master passion 
of his life. He was a great student of romance, 
of art, and of the classics, and many of his 
themes were drawn from these sources. After 
his marriage, in 1846, to Elizabeth Barrett, 
herself a poet, Browning spent much time in 
Italy. His entire life was devoted to poetry. 
His work falls into three main groups: dramas, 
dramatic monologues, and lyrics. The dramas 
are original in plot, but they lack action, de- 
pending for their interest on the analysis of the 
thoughts and feelings of their principal char- 
acters in some crisis. Pippa Passes and In.a 
Balcony are the most famoug of the dramas. 
‘The dramatic monologues are poems of varying 
length, written as though they were soliloquies 
or stories told by one man but suggesting the 
presence of other characters, and revealing 
very clearly the character and motives of the 
speaker. Of these Browning wrote a great 
number; they are his most distinctive con- 
tributions to literature. His lyrics are among 
the best in English literature. In all this work 
Browning’s appeal is to thought rather than to 
the feelings. He was a keen and vigorous 
thinker, and this quality in his works surpasses 
his narrative and lyric gifts, great as these were. 
Bryant, Wiasam Cunien (1794-1878). 
Born in Massachusetts; his parents traced 
their ancestry to the early colonists who came 
over on the Mayflower; his mother was de- 
scended from John and Priscilla Alden, and his 
father, grandfather, and grandmother’s father 
were all country doctors. As a boy, Bryant 
acted out the’story of Poe’s translation of the 
Iliad, using wooden shields and sword and an 
elaborate coat of mail. He was a lover of 
poetry, and began to write verses when eight 
years old. His early education was directed by 
country ministers, who were trained in Latin 
and Greek. At fourteen, he knew the Greek 
Testament as well as the English. ‘The next 
year he entered Williams College as a sopho- 
more, but his college course was interrupted 
because of lack of means, and he began the 
study of law, a profession which he followed for 
nine years. His first published poems were 
“Thanatopsis” and “Inscription for the -En- 
trance to a Wood,” which appeared in the 
North American Review ‘in 1817. The first of

can literature, had been written when he was

tion of his poems appeared in 1821, but had a 
very small sale. In 1825 he became editor of 
@ magezine in New York; a year later’he began 
a connection with the New York Evening Post 
which, as assistant editor, editor, and part 
owner, was destined to last fifty-two years. 
Various intervals of his life were filled by travel, 
chiefly in Europe and the Orient. Many let- 
ters by him were published in his newspaper. 
Bryant wrote. comparatively little poetry, and 
destroyed much of what he wrote. In 1866, 
after the death of his wife, he turned to the 
study of Homer, publishing | his translations of 
the Iliad and the Odyssey in 1870 and 1872. 
Until the last year of his life he walked daily 
to his office and back, a distance of three miles. 
He wrote many addresses, and took a prominent 
part in all matters that concerned good citizen- 
ship. For more than fifty years he exerted a 
strong influence on American politics and gov- 
ernment. Although: Bryant never held office, 
he occupied a position of national importance 
as editor of a powerful journal. | Nevertheless, 
itis by his poetry that he will be remembered. 
This poetry is not large in amount, but it is of 
very. high quality. He loved Nature, and her 
“various language,” of which he wrote in his 
first great poem, was familiar to > im throughout 
his long life. 
_ Burns, Ropert (1759-1796). The poems 
of Burns appeared in three editions: 1786, 
1787, and 1793. He was inspired by love, by 
keen insight into Nature, by a sturdy patriotism, 
and by a sense of the brotherhood of all men. 
‘Illustrations of each of these points, with the 
necessary biographical material to make them 
clear, will be found on pages 462-463. Burns 
was an intensely “subjective” poet, that is, 
his poems express his own thought about man 
‘and Nature, and are, in themselves, the best 
biography. The facts about his life, therefore, 
are of use to us only as they illustrate the poems 
_ and guide us in interpreting them. Many of 
the poems are bits of autobiography. . His 
father was a tenant-farmer; the son followed 
the same hard occupation except for intervals 
in Edinburgh spent in seeing his books through 
the press and becoming acquainted with the 
brilliant and intellectual group of men and 
women there who recognized his genius. For 
some years he received a small income from 
an office connected with the customs. These 
statements practically sum up the story; some 
important facts, chiefly names of persons and 
places, may be set down in a chronological 
table as a guide to reading his poems:

Byron, Lorp (1788-1824). Born in London, 
in a family whose ancestry extended to the 
time of the Norman Conquest. As a child he 
loved oriental romance, travel, the Old Testa- 
ment, and the sea. At Harrow, a great English 
public school, he was a leader in sports and 
extended his reading over a wide range of lit- 
erature. In 1805 he entered. Trinity College, 
Cambridge, and while a student there wrote a 
series of poems published in 1808 under the 
title of Hours in Idleness. The poems were 
not very good, and were severely attacked by 
a famous critic; Byron replied in a verse satire 
of great. power in which he criticized savagely 
the leading poets and novelists of his day. 
In 1809-1811 he traveled in Portugal, Spain, 
Greece, and Turkey; the result of the journey 
was the appearance of the first two cantos of 
his famous poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. 
Byron himself is the hero of the pilgrimage, 
and the brilliant descriptions of Nature, of 
ruins in famous cities, and of the stirring events 
in Europe in his own time completely captivated 
the reading public, so that seven editions of the 
poem were sold within a few weeks after its 
first appearance in 1812. The next three years 
were marked by a series of metrical romances 
that eclipsed in popular favor the narrative 
poems of Scott. In 1815 he married, but a 
year later his wife left him and he went abroad 
once more, this time never to return to his 
native land. On his way to Italy he spent 
some time (the summer of 1816) in Switzerland, 
where he wrote the third canto of Childe Harold 
and some other poems, notably “The Prisoner of 
Chillon.” ‘These poems all expressed Byron’s 
passionate love of liberty. In Venice he wrote 
the last canto of Childe Harold (1817) and this 
was followed by other long narrative poems, 
such as Don Juan (1819-1823), and a series of 
poetic dramas. He had no real dramatic genius, 
however, excelling in verse narrative, descrip- 
tion, and in his marvelous lyric genius. Mean- 
-time, he sought to become an actor in such 
stirring scenes as fill his poems, enlisting at

Conum, Paprarc (1881- _), an Irish poet 
who has lived since 1914 in the United States, 
was editor of the Irish Review (Dublin) and a founder of the Irish National Theater. His 
poems deal with Nature and are collected in 
Wild Earth and Other Poems. He contributes 
to the North American Review, the New Re- 
public, and other magazines, 
Coorrr, James Fentmorx (1789-1851). When 
he was one year old, Cooper’s parents moved 
from New Jersey to Otsego Lake in central 
New York, and there the boy grew up in a 
mansion surrounded by a wilderness filled with 
Indians and trappers, and with wonderful op- 
portunities for learning all about woodcraft, 
the secrets of animals, and the life of savages. 
After three years at Yale he went to sea, where 
he secured the knowledge that enabled him to 
write sea stories as successfully as those dealing 
with the wilderness. After a short service as a 
naval officer on Lake Ontario he married and 
settled down to an uneventful life. When past 
thirty years of age he suddenly decided that 
he could write a novel (Precaution, 1820). The 
Spy followed in 1821, and two years later he 
published The Pioneer and The Pilot. Some 
details about these and later novels are given 
on pages 206-207. After the appearance of 
The Last of the Mohicans (1826) the author went 
abroad for seven years of travel,: chiefly in 
France, Italy, and Germany. The Prairie, 
Red Rover, The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish, and The 
Water Witch were added to his novels; after his 
return, The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer com- 
pleted the famous Leatherstocking series. His 
popularity rivaled that of Scott, with whom he 
is often compared. He wrote a Naval History 
of the United States and engaged in several 
controversies about some statements contained 
in it and some criticisms that he had written 
of America when he was abroad. He wrote over 
thirty novels and romances, many of which 
were translated into various foreign languages. 
His stories are rich in incident and appeal to 
every’ lover of outdoor life. They are often 
careless in expression, owing to the speed with 
which the novelist wrote and his impatience of 
revision. Although they do not portray the 
more complex shades of character, such as 
Shakespeare could express with infinite variety,. 
Cooper has ‘to his credit a few characters that 
will last as long as books are read. 
Crawrorp, Cuarvorte Hoimss, is one of the

, Dickens, Cuarurs (1812-1870). His father 
was a poor government clerk at Portsea, Eng- 
land, and the son retained vivid memories of 
poverty and hardship, which influenced his 
novels. Only a year or two of schooling were 
allowed him, in a school of the type which he 
afterwards described so vividly that he helped 
to bring about reform. He learned shorthand 
and became a newspaper reporter; through this 
work he added many more impressions of life 
that afterwards he turned to good account. 
A series of descriptive and humorous sketches 
was reprinted in two volumes in 1835-1836. 
He worked with great energy, spending all his 
spare hours in a library, reading to supplement 
his defective education. Out of his newspaper 
experience grew the book that first gave him 
fame, Pickwick Papers (1837). His first. novel, 
Oliver Twist (1838), is a tragic story of life in 
~ the London slums. Other novels followed with 
astonishing rapidity, among them being Nich- 
olas Nickleby (1839), Old Curiosity Shop (1840), 
Barnaby Rudge (1841), Martin Chuzalewit (con- 
taining severe criticism of America, 1843), and 
David Copperfield (1850). The last of these is 
mainly a story of his own life, and is the one 
that he liked the best. He also wrote a series 
of Christmas Books during this period, and 
these contain some of his most charming stories 
such as “The Christmas Carol” and “The 
Cricket on the Hearth.” The best known 
novel of his later life is A Tale of Two Cities 
(1859), a story of the French Revolution, in 
which for the second time he ventured into the 
field of historical fiction. Dickens was a great 
traveler. After he had become famous all 
over the world he visited many places, giving 
readings from ‘his works. He was a splendid 
actor, and was able to read with such dramatic 
effectiveness that he attained a great following. 
He was fond of walking, often tramping twenty 
or thirty miles at a time. London was a never- 
‘ending source of fascination to him, and few 
men have known it as thoroughly as he. The 
novels of Dickens are an inexhaustible portrait 
gallery. Many of the characteristic sayings 
and mannerisms. of his personages have become 
proverbial. His abounding humor, his unfail- 
ing sympathy for all sorts and conditions of 
men, his mastery of pathos, and above all, the 
unending variety of his characters, all have 
given him a place very near the highest among 
creators of fiction.

Frost, Roszrt (1875- ), @ present-day 
American poet, was born in San Francisco. 
He was educated at Dartmouth College and 
Harvard University and was for a time pro- 
fessor of English at Amherst College. A Boy’s 
Will is his best known collection of poems. 
Hawrnorne, NATHANIEL (1804-1864), Born 
in Salem, Massachusetts, where the Hawthorne 
family had lived since 1637. His father died 
when Hawthorne was four years old, and his 
mother ever afterwards lived a retired life, not 
even joining her children at their, meals. An 
uncle provided for his education, and he entered 
Bowdoin College in 1821, where Longfellow 
and Franklin Pierce were among his fellow 
students. After graduation he returned to 
Salem where he spent more than twelve years 
in seclusion. He wrote constantly, and some 
of the tales and eketches that afterwards ap- 
peared in Twce-Told Tales were printed in 
newspapers. Much of what he wrote he de- 
stroyed; his object was to learn to write. He 
earned a little money by an experiment in edit- 
ing a magazine and by a book on Universal 
History, but for eleven years he published 
nothing in his own name. In 1837 he collected 
the stories that had been published in the 
periodicals, giving the book the happy title of 
Twice-Told Tales. Soon after this he secured 
a position in the Boston Custom House, his work 
being of the most prosaic character. ‘Three 
volumes of stories for children were published 
during this time, the best known of these being 
Grandfather's Chair. In 1841 he joined the 
Brook Farm community, an experiment in co- 
éperative living which he afterwards described 
in The Blithedale Romance (1852). In 1842 he 
married Sophia Peabody and went to Concord 
to live. With the publication of The Scarlet 
Letter in 1850 he won fame. This book was 
followed by another romance of New England 
life, The House of the Seven Gables. The Wonder 
Book and Tanglewood Tales are charming ver- 
sions of classical stories written for children. 
After the election to the Presidency of Pierce, 
his old college friend, he *became consul at 
Liverpool, where he remained four years, 
moving to Italy in 1857. Here he gathered 
the material that he afterwards used in The 
Marble Faun (1859). Besides his romances, 
he wrote very complete notebooks in which he 
set down his observations about life and char- 
acter and his plans for his stories. These have 
since been published, and form a valuable 
autobiography.

and is the author of A Year in a Coal Mine and

Irvine, WashinetTon (1783-1859). Born in 
New York, where his father was a hardware 
merchant with a good business. On account 
of delicate health Irving had little formal 
schooling; he studied law but did not practice. 
He was.a lover of New York and of the Hudson 
River country, some of his best works growing 
out of this devotion to the scenes of his boyhood. 
It was his purpose, he said, to give to American 
scenes something of the romantic charm that 
old legends had given to English scenes and to 
the Rhine region of Germany. To that end he 
retold some of these legends with American 
backgrounds, the stories of Rip Van Winkle 
and of Ichabod Crane being examples. His 
first work, a humorous history of the Dutch 
colony of New Amsterdam, also illustrates this 
general purpose; in it he created a story about 
the founding of New York that is better known 
than most authentic history. He pretended 
that he had found a manuscript written by a 
certain Dr, Diedrich Knickerbocker; this he 
“edited” and published in 1809, the first im- 
portant piece of pure literature in America. 
In 1815 he went to England as the representa- 
tive of the hardware business, then managed 
by. his brothers. While there he wrote the 
papers which we now know as The Sketch Book 
(181951820). For a time (1820-1826) he tray- 
eled in France and Germany, moving to Spain 
in 1826, where he spent three years collecting 
the materials which he afterwards published 
in. The Life of Columbus (1828), The Conquest 
of Granada (1829), and The Alhambra (1882). 
From 1829 to 1832 he was secretary of the 
American Legation in London, and then re- 
turned to America, ‘where he lived for ten years 
_at Tarrytown, New York, writing several books 
dealing especially with the western parts of 
‘the United States, From 1842 to 1846 he 
was Minister to Spain. His last works of 
importance were biographies of Oliver Gold- 
smith (1849) and Washington (1859). 
- Kavrman, Hersert (1878- _), author 
and editor, was. born in Washington, D. C. 
He was educated at Johns Hopkins University. 
He is a contributor to the leading magazines 
and is the author of numerous short stories 575 
and books, among them Poems. “The Hell-: 
Gate of Soissons” was first published in England 
under the title “The Song of the Guns,” and 
was later republished in The New York 
American. . 
Keats, Jonn (1795-1821). Born in London, 
and at fifteen began the study of medicine. 
His taste for poetry was so strong, however, 
that he gave his strength mainly to the study 
of literature. He was especially influenced by 
. Spenser among the English poets, and by Hoiner, 
whose epics he read in an English translation 
dating from the time of Shakespeare. In 1817 
he published a small volume of poetry, which 
was severély attacked by the critics, Other 
poems appeared in 1818 and 1820, the last 
representing much more mature work than the 
poems that had appeared only two years 
previously. In part this was due to the in- 
cessant study he carried on, but his genius 
matured: rapidly, as if he knew that he had 
but a short time in which to work. On account 
of increasing ill health he went to Italy in the 
hope of regaining his strength, but the effort 
was unavailing, and he died at the age of 
twenty-five. His greatest poems are “En- 
dymion,” “The Eve of St. Agnes,” “Lamia,” 
and “Hyperion,” all of them narrative, but he 
also wrote many sonnets and other lyrics of 
great distinction. These poems are remarkable 
for their lyrical charm, their imaginative 
splendor, their descriptions of Nature, and their 
passionate love of beauty. 
Kipurne, Rupyarp (1865- ), master: of 
the art of telling stories, either in prose or 
verse, lives in England. He was born in 
Bombay, India, of British parents, His 
Barrack-Room Ballads have a ring and a move- 
ment that suggest the old days when the 
ballad-maker was a man of action, living the 
adventures that he celebrated in song. Kipling 
is best known to boys and girls as the author of * 
the Jungle Books. 
Lamp, Caartes (1775-1834). English essay- 
ist and critic, born in London. He was edu- 
cated at Christ’s Hospital School, being a fellow 
pupil of Coleridge. In 1789 he became a clerk 
in the office of the East India Company, one of 
the great commercial organizations of England, 
and followed this occupation for nearly forty 
years. He was a great friend of Coleridge and 
Wordsworth, and was one of the. first to recog- 
nize their genius. His clerkship was merely a 
means of earning a livelihood; his real life was 
among his books and his friends. Studies in 
the English drama led to the famous Tales from 
Shakespeare (1807), which he wrote with his 
sister, and to many critical essays. His fame, 
however, rests on the Essays of Elia (1823;
-P-A-G-E-585
576 
second series 1838), which first appeared in a 
magazine. These illustrate his mastery of that 
type of essay in which a writer talks informally 
with his readers, much as in brilliant conver- 
sation. The essays are on a great variety of 
topics: personal, humorous, fanciful, narrative, 
with some serious criticism of life and letters. 
Lamb is chiefly remembered for his humor, his 
exquisite sense of style, and his lovable per- 
* sonality. He had an infinite capacity for 
friendship, and this he revealed not only in 
conversation but also in his letters, which are 
among the most charming in English literature. 
Lanter, Sipney (1842-1881). American poet, 
born in Macon, Georgia, and educated at 
Oglethorpe College. His plan was to study 
abroad and then to return to the South to be 
a college teacher, but the Civil War prevented 
his carrying out this purpose. After his service 
in the Confederate Army he tried business, 
teaching, and work in his father’s law office, but 
did not return to his boyhood purpose until 
1872. He had become an excellent musician 
and went to Baltimore, where he played first 
flute in the Peabody orchestra. His spare time 
he devoted to the study of English literature. 
He had little money and was already stricken 
with the disease which was to cut short his 
life. In .1875 he won recognition for a poem 
entitled “Corn” and two years later published 
a collection of poéms. He wrote several books 
for boys, in which he retold legends and 
famous romances. He also wrote a scholarly 
discussion of English verse. Other poems, 
together with some letters, essays, and a series 
of papers on the English novel, were published 
after his death. For two years prior to his 
death he was lecturer in English literature at 
Johns. Hopkins University. Lanier’s greatest 
contribution to American literature was in 
-his lyric poems. His musical genius enabled 
* him to illustrate very skillfully the connection 
between lyric poetry and song. In “The 
' Symphony,” for example, the stanzas suggest 
the various instruments of the great orchestra, 
each contributing its interpretation of the main 
theme. Besides their lyrical beauty, his poems 
reveal the lovable personality that. made him 
one of the noblest of men. 
Locrsart, Joan Grason (1794-1854). Edi- 
tor, critic, and biographer; the son-in-law of 
Sir Walter Scott. He edited Blackwood’s, one 
of a group of famous quarterly reviews of lit- 
erature and politics, and was connected with 
other similar journals. His fame rests on his 
authorship of two important biographies: 
(ie a of Burns (1828), and The Life of Scott 
1838). 
aT BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AUTHORS 
Lonereuiow, Henry Wansworta (1807- 
1882). Born in Portland, Maine, where his 
father was a lawyer; educated at Bowdoin 
College; distinguished as a boy for his reading 
and as a writer of verse. His father wanted 
him to study law, but he was offered a position 
at Bowdoin, and went abroad for three years 
of study in France, Spain, and Italy, in prepara- 
tion for the work. On his return he wrote 
essays for the North American Review and 
other periodicals. In 1884 he was elected to 
a professorship at Harvard and went abroad 
once more for study in Sweden and Denmark. 
Tn 1839 he published a romance, Hyperion, and 
a small volume of poems. The first was really 
a journal of travel; the second, Voices of the 
Night, was a collection of ballads and lyrics. 
In 1841 he published more ballads, and other 
books followed rapidly, among them Evangeline 
(1847), The Golden Legend (1851), Hiawatha 
(1855), and Miles Standish (1858). After 
1854 he gave himself entirely to his literary 
work, ' His wife met a tragic death in 1861, 
and Longfellow turned to his translation of 
Dante’s Divine Comedy and to verse narratives 
of various medieval legends. He was a man of 
lovable personality, devoted to his home, his 
friends, and his books, His best-known poems 
deal with homely sentiment and aspiration, 
with love and death and the common experience 
of men. He has therefore been called “the 
household poet,” and he is the most widely 
read of American poets. Besides this, he is 
to be remembered for his service in bringing 
the European literatures within the range of 
the developing American culture. His studies 
in Dante and other medieval literature, his 
ballads, his verse legends drawn from or in- 
fluenced by the heroic tales of northern Europe, 
his love for Shakespeare, Chaucer, and the older 
English writers, all made him a sort of mis- 
sionary of culture to his fellow-countrymen.

Miss Maria White turned his attention definitely 
away from Jaw and resulted in the publication 
of his first volume of poems, 4 Year's Life, in 
1841." He also published a series of papers on 
the early English dramatists, and started, with 
a friend, a literary magazine which lasted only 
three months. A second volume of poems 
appeared in 1844 and also a volume of prose 
entitled Conversations on Some of the Old Poets. 
In 1848 “A Fable for Critics” appeared; this 
was a rimed review of American literature. 
“The Vision of Sir Launfal’ belongs to the 
same year, and also a volume of miscellaneous 
poems. He went abroad in 1851, and after his 
return succeeded Longfellow as professor of 
Modern Languages at Harvard. In 1857 he 
became the first editor of the Adlantic Monthly, 
which has long exerted a powerful influence 
on the development of American _litera- 
ture. His own contributions to this maga- 
zine and to the North American Review, of 
which he later became. an associate editor, were 
papers of distinction on politics and literature. 
He was, in fact, interested almost equally in 
these three fields: poetry, literary criticism, 
and politics. Some of his poetry is of a political 
nature, such as the “Bigelow Papers” (first 
.series, 1848; second series, 1862-1866). His 
great “Commemoration Ode” (1865), read in 
honor of Harvard men who had died in the 
war, is an example of poetry of lofty vein 
united to a political idealism thoroughly ex- 
pressive of America. His public services, aside 
from his writings, were very great. He was 
for three years minister to Spain, and after- 
wards became one of the most distinguished of 
all ambassadors sent by the United States to 
England. Some additional biographical details 
will be found on pages 449-450. 
Lusesocr, Sm Jonn (1884-1918), was the son 
of Sir John Lubbock, a famous astronomer and. 
mathematician; he was born in London and edu- 
cated at Eton. At the age of fourteen he was 
taken into his father’s bank and, in 1856, 
became a partner. He says, “Though I was 
thus early brought into harness, I had plenty of 
holidays,” and these holidays he spent in 
studying natural history long before it was 
taught in the schools. It was due to Darwin, 
the great scientist, who was much interested 
in the boy, that he was given a microscope, with 
which to pursue his scientific studies.- In later 
life he was a member of many famous societies 
and served on many public commissions. He 
is best. known for his scientific writings. His 
book, Ants, Bees, and Wasps, ran through five 
editions in less than a year, and The Pleasures 
of Life, the most popular of his books, had 
@n even greater sale. The Beauties of Nature, 577 
from which the selection in this book is taken, 
‘was published in 1892, and has been translated 
into many languages. 
Marxsam, Epwin (1852- ), poet and 
writer, is a native of Oregon. He taught school 
in California, and is now’a resident of West 
New Brighton, New York. He has written 
poems since early boyhood, and is honorary 
President of the Poetry Society of America. 
His best-known poems are “Lincoln, the Man 
of the People,” and “The Man With the Hoe.” 
Marsnaut, Eptson (1894- _—+), author and 
magazine writer, is a native of Indiana. 
He was educated at the University of Oregon, 
where he wrote, while a student, his first short 
story. He is a contributor to the American 
Magazine, Everybody's, Metropolitan Magazine, 
and to the Saturday Evening Post. He is the 
author of The Voice of the Pack, The Snowshoe 
Trail, and The Strength of the Pines. My. 
Marshall was awarded the first prize in the 
O. Henry Memorial Short Story Collection for 
1922. 
Mowrog, Harriet, poet and writer, author 
of “April—North Carolina,” is editor of Poetry, 
A Magazine of Verse. She lives in Chicago and 
is one of the foremost poets of the new school 
of modern verse. 
Norris, Frank (1870-1902), a journalist and 
novelist, was born in Chicago. He was edu- 
cated at the University of California and Har- 
vard University. During the Spanish-American 
War he -was war correspondent for McClure’s 
Magazine. He gained distinction as a, promis- 
ing member of the group of younger novelists 
through The Octopus, which was the first of a 
series of three novels in which he planned 
“the epic of the wheat.” The second story, 
The Pit, followed, but the third éne, The Wolf, 
was not written. 
Norss, ALFRED (1880- ), an English poet, 
lives in London. He was educated at Oxford 
University, and has since devoted himself to 
literature. He is a contributor to the leading 
British and American magazines, and has ‘writ- 
ten many beautiful poems and ballads. In 
1918-1919 Mr. Noyes lectured in the United 
States and taught literature at Princeton 
University. 
Por, Epear Axtan (1809-1849). Born in 
Boston, of Southern parentage. His parents 
were actors who died when Poe was very young, 
and he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a merchant 
of Richmond. From 1815 to 1820 the Allans 
were abroad, and Poe was placed in school in 
England. On his return he spent a year at the 
University of Virginia, but his college course 
was not completed because of a break with
-P-A-G-E-587
  . Allan. The remainder of Poe’s life was 
of poverty and struggle, despite his pos- 
session of literary and editorial gifts that should 
have insured him success. His first poems 
appeared in 1827, and other volumes were 
published in 1829 and 1831. 
was appointed editor of the Southern Literary 
Messenger, published at Richmond; later he 
edited periodicals in Philadelphia and New 
York. He desired most of all to found a lit- 
erary magazine in the South and went back to 
Richmond to start the project. For this he 
had -been prepared by his reputation notonly as 
& poet but as the greatest writer of short stories 
America had produced; he was also a literary 
critic whose work, though not large in amount, 
was of high quality. The project, however, 
was not destined to come to reality, on account 
of his untimely death. Collections of his 
prose tales appeared in 1839 and 1845, and his 
last volume of poems in 1845. Poetry he 
defined as “‘the rhythmical creation of beauty”; 
he preferred the lyric to other forms of poetry, 
because he held that a true poem represents a 
moment of intense emotional experience. The 
same idea runs through much of his comment 
on the meaning and art of the short story, 
which he preferred to the novel because of 
greater compactness and unity. Further de- 
tails qn some points connected with the life 
and work of Poe will be found on page 76. 
Rooszveut, THEODORE (1858-1919), twenty- 
sixth President of the United States, was born 
in the city of New York. He was graduated 
from Harvard University and soon afterwards 
was elected to the legislature of New York. 
He was appointed Assistant, Secretary of the 
Navy by President McKinley, a position which 
he resigned to enter the Spanish-American War. 
In 1898 he was elected Governor of New York 
and in 1900 Vice-President of the United States. 
Upon the death of McKinley, Roosevelt be- 
came President. He was a vigorous American, 
basing his theory of politics on honesty, courage, 
hard work, and fair play. His writings cover a 
wide range, but particularly helpful are those 
dealing with the ideals of citizenship. 
Scuerer, James A. B. (1870- ), was born 
in Salisbury, North Carolina, and was educated 
at Roanoke College, Virginia. He has written 
a number of books on Japan, having spent 
several years in that country. Mr. Scherer has 
been President of Newberry College (South 
Carolina) and of Throop College of Technology 
at Pasadena, California. He was made a 
member cf the California Council of Defense 
and also of the Council of National Defense. BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AUTHORS

Suutizy, Purcy Byssue (1792-1822). , Born 
in Sussex, England, in a wealthy family, 
Shelley did not have the heart-breaking struggle For 
. with poverty that was the fate of many other 
young men who desired to enter a literary 
career. Before he was ten years old he wrote 
a play, and as a student at Eton, one of the 
great English preparatory schools, he wrote a 
novel and sold it to a publisher for forty pounds. 
He was a lover of science, especially chemistry, 
and his room at Oxford was filled with all kinds 
- of material used in his experiments. He: was 
forced to leave Oxford without completing his 
course, had a quarrel with his father, and for 
a time lived only on the small sums his sisters 
gave him. After a time he was reconciled to 
his father, and went on with various schemes 
for reform. He hated tyranny of every sort, 
and many of his best poems are devoted to the 
praise of liberty. He was a great student of 
philosophy, of ancient literature, and of the 
Italian poets. In 1818 he went to Italy, where 
he passed the remainder of his life. While 
he wrote several dramas and some narrative 
poems, Shelley’s genius was chiefly lyrical. 
He could not tell a story well because he was 
often so carried away by some vision of beauty, 
some scene that ,he wished to describe, or by 
intense emotion, that the thread of the story is 
lost. But his songs, his poems of Nature de- 
scription (such, for example, as “The Cloud,” 
“The Skylark,” “The West Wind’) and such 
philosophical poems as “Prometheus Unbound” 
and the “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,” are 
among the finest in English literature. Perhaps 
the greatest of all his poems is “Adonais,” a 
lament for Keats. 
Su, Epwarp Row anp (1841-1887), was 
born at Windsor, Connecticut. He was grad- 
uated from Yale and lived most of his life in Cal- 
ifornia, being for some years professor of 
English language. and literature at the State 
University. Sill was a true poet, but the 
whole of his literary output is contained in 
two slender volumes. His poems are -noted. 
for their compressed thought. The selection 
here given shows this quality. 
Soutuey, Rosert (1774-1843). Before he 
left’ school Southey had planned to portray 
“all the more prominent and poetical forms of 
mythology which have at any time obtained 
among mankind, by making each the ground- 
work of an heroic poem.” He did not live up 
to these ambitious ideals, but the number of

BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AUTHORS 
his works is very great, and most of his poems 
are very long. His first epic was devoted to 
Joan of Arc, as with Coleridge and Wordsworth 
he was an enthusiastic admirer of France. A 
long series of metrical romances deal with 
oriental subjects, and he also wrote many 
ballads, His verse-narratives preceded those 
of Scott, and were well received, though Southey 
did not attain the enormous popularity after- 
wards won by Scott. Southey translated 
romances from the Spanish, and was a scholar 
of distinction. His prose includes histories, 
notably a history of Brazil, and a series of 
excellent biographies, of which the life of 
Nelson is the most famous. In 1813 he be- 
came poet laureate. 
Spencer, Wsiuam Rosert (1769-1834), 
English poet and wit, was educated at Harrow 
and Oxford, and was commissioner of stamps 
from 1797 to 1826. . His wit and accomplish- 
ments made him very popular in London 
society, but natural indolence prevented his 
winning prominence in public life. His works 
include a translation of Biirger’s Leonore, 
Urania, a Burlesque, and Poems. Owing to 
financial embarrassment he withdrew to Paris 
in’ 1825, and remained there until his death. 
Sremer,. Epwarp A. (1866- ), was born 
in Vienna, Austria, and was graduated from 
the University of Heidelberg. Himself an 
immigrant, later a naturalized citizen of Amer- 
ica, he has been active in Americanization 
work in the United States, both through his 
lectures and his writings. Among his best- 
known works are From Alien to Citizen, from 
which “America” is taken; On the Trail of the 
Immigrant; Nationalizing America; and The 
Immigrant Tide, 
Stevenson, Rosert Lours (1850-1894). For 
biography see pages 79-84. 
Tarpewt, Ipa Minerva (1857- ), author 
and magazine writer, was born in Pennsylvania. 
After being graduated from Allegheny College 
she studied in Paris. Some of her best-known 
works are: Life of Abraham Lincoln; Short Life 
of Napoleon Bonaparte; He Knew Lincoln; His- 
tory of the Standard Oil Company; New Ideals 
in Business. 
Tuomas, Lerta Eviarta, one of the younger 
group of writers of the Middle West, lives in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan. Much of her lyric 
verse has been given musical setting and has 
been produced in the larger cities of the United 
States. Her poem, “What America Means ‘to 
Me,” was awarded the Theodosia Garrison 
Poetry Prize at the Biennial Convention of 
the National Federation of Women’s Clubs in 579 
1920, in a contest open to all members of 
women’s clubs of the United States. 
Tuorrav, Henry Davin (1817-1862). Born 
at Concord, Massachusetts; his father, a pencil © 
maker; educated at Harvard, where he began 
his practice of keeping a journal. All his 
writings, covering thirty manuscript volumes, 
were in this form, and most of his books have 
been made up after his death by selecting 
passages from different places in these journals. 
As a whole, they show the great amount of 
interesting material that may be gathered by 
one who keeps his eyes open to things that sur- 
round him every day. Most of Thoreau’s 
life was devoted to “endless walks and miscel- 
Janeous studies.” In 1845 he built for himself 
a hut on the shore of Walden Pond, a small lake 
near Concord, where he lived for two years a 
life of meditation, study, and simple work. 
He says his total expense for the two years was 
seventy dollars. He kept a record of his ob- 
servations “on man, on Nature, and on human 
life” that was published under the title of 
Walden in 1854, This is his most widely known 
book. It is filled with minute observations on 
insects, birds, the waters of the pond, the . 
weather, and many similar subjects. Besides 
these observations of Nature, there are many 
comments on life and politics, on literature and 
various. philosophical subjects, but it is as a 
book about Nature that Walden will live. It 
is marked by the simplicity and sincerity that 
characterized the man. 
Trop, Henry (1829-1867), was born in 
Charleston, South Carolina. He was educated 
at the University of Georgia. His father was 
the author of a volume of verse, and the son 
became a contributor to Russell’s Magazine and 
The Southern Literary Messenger. He was 
engaged in journalism as correspondent and 
editor of South Carolina newspapers during the 
war. His poems were published in 1859; they 
were edited in 1873 by his friend, Paul Hamilton 
Hayne, and later, by J. P. Kennedy Bryan. 
Twarn, Marx (Samvry L. Cremens, 1835- 
1910), was born in Missouri and passed his boy- 
hood in the river town of Hannibal, where he 
learned much about the sort of life that he 
depicts in several of his best-known books. 
He was of a roving disposition. At twelve he 
was apprenticed to a printer; later he went 
East and worked at his trade in New York 
and Philadelphia. In 1856 he secured work 
on the Mississippi River and in two years was 
a licensed steamboat pilot. His experiences 
here he used in his book entitled Life on the 
Mississippi (1883). With his brother he went 
to Nevada, worked at mining and lumbering, 
and finally edited a paper at Virginia City.

After a short experience here he went to San 
Francisco and secured 2 position on a daily 
paper, which he soon gave up in order to travel 
in the Sandwich Islands. In 1867 his story 
about the “Celebrated Jumping Frog,” pub- 
lished in a New York paper, attracted attention, 
and a series of letters written while on a trip 
to Europe and Palestine was published under 
the title of Innocents Abroad in 1869. On his 
return he did editorial work on a paper in 
Buffalo, and in 1871 moved to Hartford, 
Connecticut. Most of his later life was spent 
. in Connecticut and New York, but his most 
distinctive literary work ‘is identified with the 
West, which he knew thoroughly. His fame 
resta on The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) 
and Huckleberry Finn (1885). For additional 
details about these books see page 16. 
Ware, Girpert (1720-1793), English writer 
on natural history, was born in Selborne, Eng- 
land. He was educated at Oxford and in 1747 
was ordained to the ministry. He spent most 
of his life in or near the little Hampshire village 
of Selborne. His daily life was unbroken by 
great changes or incidents and left him free to 
indulge his strong naturalist tendencies. The 
Natural History of Selborne, from which “The 
Tortoise” is taken, has been said to be the 
first book which raised natural history into 
the region of literature. 
Warrmier, Joun GReENnLEAF (1807- 1892). 
Born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, i in a family 
of Quaker farmers; the house in which he was 
born had been occupied by the Whittier family 
since 1688, His boyhood was passed in work 
on the farm and in short terms of study in the 
country school. At fourteen he came upon a 
volume of poems by Burns and these inspired 
him to try his hand at writing poetry. A little 
later he was able to attend Haverhill Academy 
for two winters, earning his expenses by shoe- 
making. In 1828 he edited a Boston paper for 
a short time and later on was connected with 
weekly papers at Haverhill and at Hartford, 
Connecticut. In 1836 he moved to Amesbury, 
which became his home for the remainder of 
his life. He published a.collection of poems in 
1837, and other volumes appeared at frequent 
intervals throughout his life. “Snow-Bound,” 
the best-known of his longer poems, appeared in 
1866. This poem is often compared with “The 
Cotter’s Saturday Night” because of its pic- 
tures of life in a rural community. Whittier 
wrote many ballads and lyrics; it is chiefly as 
a lyrie and descriptive poet that he is remem- 
bered. His subjects Were drawn. from early 
New England history, Indian legends, and BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AUTHORS 
Nature and life.in rural Massachusetts. He is 
remembered also as a writer of hymns and 
other poems of religious faith. Books had 
little influence on him; he sang of the dignity of 
labor and of simple faith. 
Witson, Wooprow (1856- ), twenty- 
eighth President of the United States, is a 
native of Virginia. He was educated at Prince- 
ton University, and later became president of 
that institution. He has written many books 
on history and government, which are models 
of good English, In 1911 he became Governor 
of New Jersey, and in 1918 he entered upon his 
duties as President of the United States, serving 
throughout the difficult period of the World War. 
Worvsworts, Wriram (1770-1850). Born 
in Cumberland, England; his boyhood passed 
amid scenes of great natural beauty, which had 
a deeper influence on him than the formal ou 
cation he received in school and at Cambridge 
University. While a college student he went 
on a walking tour on the Continent and was 
powerfully impressed by the revolutionary 
movements then going on. For a time he was 
an ardent sympathizer with the Revolution in 
France; after his return, however, he settled 
down to a life of study and meditation, broken 
only now and then by foreign travel. His 
friendship for Coleridge led to the publication 
in 1798 of a, small volume written by the two 
men and named Lyrical Ballads. To this 
Wordsworth contributed a number of poems 
about Nature in which he sought to show the 
beauty and mystery in common scenes. His 
poetry, like that of Coleridge, was very different 
’ from what was then regarded in England as true 
poetry; it used only simple words, preferred 
simple themes, and found in ordinary aspects 
of Nature and life abundant material for ex- 
pressing emotion and interpreting beauty. 
Because of the difference in subject.and form 
from the standards of the time, this poetry was 
not at first well received. Later in his life, 
however, Wordsworth was widely recognized 2s 
one of the greatest of English poets. His 
poems, which are very numerous, are on a 
great variety of subjects: stories, Nature 
poems, and poems giving his ideas on many 
aspects of life and thought. 
Wyart, Evita Franguin (1873- +), was 
born in Wisconsin and educated. in Chicago 
and at Bryn Mawr College. Among her writ- 
ings are Everyone His Own Way, True Love, 
Making Both Ends Meet, Great Companions, and 
The Wind in the Corn, from which “On the 
Great Plateau” is taken. Her home is in 
Chicago.

INDEX OF TOPICS AND SPECIAL TERMS 
Accent (stress), 290, 300. In general, emphasis 
ona syllable or a word. In prose, these 
stresses come at irregular intervals, just as 
the words of the sentence happen to be ar- 
ranged. Test this with the sentence you 
have just ‘read, marking each stress with an 
“x.” In most verse, the words and syllables 
are so arranged as to bring the accented 
syllables at regular intervals, thus producing 
that regularity of sound and movement which 
we call meter. Note that words of one syl- 
lable, if important, may receive stress in 
poetry. See Rhythm, Meter, Iambic, etc. 
Alliteration, 245, 300. The repetition of initial 
consonants, as in “A mighty fountain mo-

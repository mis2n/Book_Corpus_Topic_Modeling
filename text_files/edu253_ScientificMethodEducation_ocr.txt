EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Prior to the time of Horace Mann and the other 
educational revivalists, the improvement of 
teaching practice was so gradual that it scarcely 
attracts the attention of the educational histo- 
rian. Tradition clutched the classroom firmly. 
Individual experience, with its endless trial and 
error, wove new patterns of procedure, but not 
many. A single inspired writer of textbooks 
with a new plan for organizing subject-matter 
had more professional effect than the numerous 
innovating but isolated teachers who may have 
discovered desirable changes. Teachers were 
not codperative. They were not a group with a 
common association which permitted them to 
share one another’s successes. 
With the period of educational revival, the 
profession acquired organization. It was crude 
as compared with present standards, but it was 
epoch-making in its usefulness. Teachers were 
brought together for study and discussion. They 
exchanged experiences. Practice was cross- 
fertilized and enriched by exchange of ideas.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION ~ 
Specialized leaders were called into service as the 
supervisors or managers of State and city school 
systems. ‘Their function was to discover good 
teaching methods and to disseminate them 
among their associates. But the good went be- 
yond the exchange and appraisal of individual 
skills. Some of the leaders had looked outside 
their own domains into the systems of adjoining 
States, and a few had traveled in Europe to note 
the working of a different tradition in foreign 
school systems. Contrasts are always unsettling. 
They raise questions and encourage borrowing 
and adaptation. But progress under such condi- 
tions remains empirical, being based on mere 
personal experience or observation. It was the 
exchange of practical technique among teachers 
which led to the new results. No new mode of 
inquiry had been utilized. 
With the beginning of the last quarter of the 
nineteenth century, a new influence was brought 
to bear upon American education — the theories ~ 
of European philosophers where general con- 
cepts were applied to the psychology and peda- 
gogy of childhood. A considerable number of 
American educators had pursued their university 
training in European universities, particularly 
those of Germany, and these eager and enthusias-

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
tic students of education brought the specula- 
tions of Herbart and Froebel to bear upon Ameri- 
can practice. Other philosophies became a part 
of current discussion. Americans soon devel- 
oped, largely through reflection upon their own 
experiences, educational philosophies of their 
own. It was a period of great stimulation and 
_ heightened experimentation. Infancy, child- 
- hood, youth, and adolescence began to be ob- 
served under the promptings of diverse theory 
and practice, preparing the way for something 
better than the appeal to ordinary experience 
and deductive applications of novel theories. 
Early in the twentieth century the wedges of 
inquiry and experimentation had pushed their 
way into professional thinking, promising an- 
other significant turn in the road of professional 
progress. 
A discriminating analysis of the kinds of 
thinking which have characterized the sessions of 
educational leaders, particularly during the past 
ten years, would probably show few new varie- 
ties of thought. It does, however, reveal two 
very significant facts. First, the usual empirical 
and speculative thinking of teachers has lost its 
dominance, its place being taken by reports and 
discussions based upon inquiries made in a rigid 
ix

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
scientific spirit and pursued by the accurate 
modes of modern science. Second, the profes- 
sional mind itself has developed a new sensitive- 
ness, becoming tremendously receptive to sug- 
gested reforms based on scientific inquiry and 
exceedingly skeptical of proposals which do not 
possess a firm fact basis. 
From such observations it is clear that the 
scientific movement in education is well under 
way. Its promise can scarcely be predicted in 
detail. We are, indeed, at an important turn 
in the road of educational advance, perhaps the 
most significant in all our history. From every 
field of science, both natural and humanistic, we 
are taking specific scientific procedures and util- 
izing them to understand the determining fac- 
tors in education; in addition we are developing 
special scientific ingenuities of our own. l 
To understand the contemporaneous scientific 
movement in the educational profession is not a 
simple matter. Yet such comprehension is the 
need of every teacher. An inclusive yet simple 
summary is required. To this end the book here 
presented has been written. It records the vari- 
ous modes of advance with adequate concrete 
illustrations; it leads us into an understanding of 
our present circumstance with its apparent con-

INTRODUCTION 
To-pay more than ever before science is looked 
upon as the giver of gifts, the panacea for all ills. 
The mythical man in the street wears shoes whose 
composition soles are made by a new scientific 
process; they were sold to him through scientific 
advertising or by a scientific sales talk. He 
climbs into his motor which was but recently the 
scientific wonder of the age, and enjoys the com- 
fort afforded by his balloon tires, the most recent 
gift of science to transportation comfort. When 
he comes to his home he “listens in ” on some dis- 
tant speech or concert over his new radio set, the 
latest marvel of science. 
So popular has the term become that to call a 
product scientific is to sell it by the million, if we 
are to judge from the advertising which now com- 
prises so large a part of our newspapers and mag- 
azines. And in no field has the term been used 
with greater prodigality than in the field of 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
human thought and action. The older ‘sciences’ 
of palmistry and phrenology are decked out in 
new guise so that we have the science of reading 
character at sight, the science of personality- 
building, the science of auto-suggestion, and 
many others; and there are scientific memory 
courses, and scientific lectures on sure and easy 
ways to secure health, happiness, and success. 
As a result of the widespread publicity given to 
such charlatanism through the rapid expansion 
of advertising, the word ‘scientific’ has come to 
mean to the man in the street a kind of combina- 
tion of the highbrow, the up-to-date, and the 
crooked. And science is a kind of scheme that 
can be counted on to get results by a short-cut 
route. We often hear the phrase, “‘He’s got it 
down to a science,” which may apply to making 
train connections to get to the office on time, or 
to breaking the law consistently without being 
caught. 
It is doubtful if those engaged in the profession 
of teaching are influenced particularly by this 
widespread, loose usage, though it may some- 
times creep into their non-professional vocabu- 
lary. Nevertheless, there are two ways that the 
term, if thoughtlessly used, can bring numberless 
disasters in its wake. 
2
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION 
The first of these is a too greedy acceptance of 
what purports to be scientific in the educational 
field. It has been known to happen that a ten- 
tative hypothesis of a scientific worker has been 
pounced upon by a school administrator who 
wished to profit by whatever science had to offer, 
or who may have had less commendable motives, 
with the result that the smooth-running of a 
school has been interfered with and no advantage 
gained. The history of the measurement move- 
ment in education, for example, could furnish 
many instances of such action, as could another 
very excellent movement, namely, that for 
bettering the health of school children. Without 
adequate knowledge or preparation, the incor- 
poration of the newer findings of science brings 
about more harm than good. People come to 
refer to them as ‘half-baked’ schemes, and the 
cause of progress is set back many years. 
The other way that a lack of proper under- 
standing of the meaning of Science can work a 
positive harm is by forswearing her and all her 
works. This is the attitude of the reactionary 
who distrusts innovations, who determinedly falls 
back upon his old and habitual way of doing 
things, and cannot be forced out of his groove. 
It is clear that positive harm can come from 
jo 8 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
either of these two attitudes. And although they 
are in part due to temperamental differences, they 
are to a still greater extent due, I believe, to 
ignorance. Those who have worked up to their 
present positions through gradual promotion, and 
whose training was in the normal school of the 
older type, may have had little opportunity to 
comprehend what is meant by the scientific 
method particularly as applied to educational 
problems. Their high-school science courses 
probably supplied little. Their normal course 
was taken up with methods of teaching usually 
of a formal character, in that they learned ready- 
made principles, and with instruction in the con- 
tent of the subjects they were to teach. Since 
that time, they have been busy in the day-to-day 
tasks of instruction and administration, and few 
have had any opportunity to break away and 
become thoroughly grounded in scientific study. 
Those whose preparation has been more recent, 
or who have come by way of the college, have, in 
many cases, fared little better. College courses 
in the sciences — physics, chemistry, biology, 
etc. — are all too often actually little more than 
training in following directions as given in the 
laboratory manual, half-hearted note-taking dur- 
ing lectures, and copying the notes or ‘find- 
4

  INTRODUCTION 
ings’ of others. Even when college teachers of 
science are aware of these dangers and do what 
they can to guard against them, they are too busy 
covering the required work to assist pupils to 
generalize their experience to see that it applies 
in other fields. They all too frequently have 
no realization, themselves, that the method of 
science can be brought to bear on the problems 
of education. No wonder students leave college 
regarding the scientific method as applicable 
merely to certain particular parts of the cur- 
riculum rather than as a method of approaching 
any subject-matter. 
When the sciences are taught in an unscien- 
tific spirit, it is too much to expect that the usual 
courses in education will fill the breach. History 
and Principles are still in many places the maxi- 
mum requirement, and the course too easily fol- 
lows the old track. The addition of a few other 
courses likewise fails to inculcate the scientific 
viewpoint in such a way that students can ap- 
preciate it, or use it to grapple with educational 
problems they are soon to meet. 
Clearly no book can take the place of rigid 
scientific training; and certainly a book of this 
size can do no more than point out certain facts, 
and show certain relationships. But even in 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
these few pages it should be possible to clarify 
the thinking of students in regard to the relation- 
ship of science to education, and to assist teachers 
and administrators to avoid being either wild- 
eyed innovators or dyed-in-the-wool conserva- 
tives when they come to a consideration of the 
contributions of science to education. 
As has been said earlier, the word ‘science’ 
is sadly misused in common speech. Literally, 
it means ‘knowledge’ (Latin, scientia), though 
certain quite legitimate, specific meanings have 
been attached toit. It ismore commonly defined 
as a systematic and orderly arrangement of 
knowledge referred to the general truths or prin- 
ciples from which it is derived. More narrowly 
still, it is used to refer to certain branches of 
learning such as chemistry, physics, and biology. 
But this idea of orderly arrangement quite 
overlooks the method of acquisition of the know- 
ledge which is to be arranged in orderly fashion. 
It is the method of science which is by far the most 
important thing about it. One’s appreciation of 
the meaning of this word is likewise enhanced by 
an understanding of its derivation. Etymologi- 
cally, it means a ‘ pursuit of’ (Greek, methodos). 
The scientific method, then, means literally the 
pursuit of knowledge. But it is a particular kind
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTION 
of pursuit, for a method is a way of reaching a 
given end by a series of acts that tend to secure it. 
It is an orderly procedure or process. 
To this extent, therefore, the word is applicable 
to any number of situations. These may be 
quite objective, for one may speak of a method of 
attack used in war, or on a smaller scale of the 
method of attack of a salesman in the effort to 
sell his goods. Or, we speak of the method of 
attack upon a problem, the solution of which we 
seek. In education, the word is usually con- 
fined to classroom procedure, so that we consider 
methods of teaching geography or spelling. Or 
we use the term more broadly to apply to any of 
a number of school subjects and speak of the 
method of measurement, the developmental 
method, or the problem-project method. In all 
of these cases, we are considering an orderly 
procedure or process in the direction of a given 
end, whether that end be taking a city, selling 
some goods, or teaching children. 
In this book, we are discussing the application 
of the scientific method to educational problems. 
It will be necessary to give detailed consideration 
to this method as it has been developed in the 
process of the pursuit of knowledge. But before 
doing this, we shall ask what other ways man- 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
kind has used to acquire the knowledge sought. 
This seeking has seldom come except as diffi 
culties are felt. In the face of the multitude of 
difficulties confronting every one — difficulties 
of adjustment to the vagaries of nature, diffi- 
culties of adjustment to the complexities of 
human society, difficulties of doing what we want 
to do and of finding out what we want to find 
out — it is natural that some easy way should 
be sought. It is natural that the ‘orderly pro- 
cedure,’ the ‘series of steps,’ should be passed by 
in favor of some simpler way. We shall now 
review briefly some of these simpler ways.

THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
Sources of Authority 
1. Universal need for guidance. In the total 
number of a man’s activities comparatively few 
will be brought consciously to his attention so he 
will not need to choose between them, much less 
ask any one’s advice. The great majority of 
things that he does he will do because he knows 
or desires no other way. The customs of his folk 
and his own habits will make his decisions for 
him without his realizing that they are decisions. 
The clothes he wears, the gatherings he frequents, 
the food he eats, the shelter in which he lives, the 
language he speaks — these things are for the 
most part decided for him. 
But some of the most important things that 
must be done cannot be decided by custom or 
habit; in times of crises these are frequently 
insufficient. In public life there are issues over 
which men clash, and the people call for a-leader 
to solve their problems for them. One of the 
most pitiful things in the world is the ptospect of 
a great people calling for a leader, some one to 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
solve their difficulties for them, some one to re- 
lieve them of responsibility, a Hercules to pull 
their carts out of the mire. 
Each person, likewise, often feels the need of 
some one to show him the way, to help make his 
decisions for him. We read enviously of how 
Gideon was able to make assurance doubly sure 
through the simple means of a fleece and the dew 
and thus appeal to his highest Authority to aid 
him in the solution of the problem which was 
troubling him mightily. 
Throughout the ages Man’s difficulties, 
whether they have to do with his relationship to 
Nature or to his fellow-man, have been decided 
by an appeal to religious authority, with its re- 
cognition of the power of the unseen, or by an 
appeal to civil authority, with its recognition of 
the power of armed force. Even in the simplest 
unit of social organization, the family, the two 
powers were frequently recognized; the father was 
the religious and civil head. He was the priest 
and king. The absolutism of this authority is 
difficult to appreciate now in an age when both 
functions seem to have been so largely renounced. 
The stories of exposure of undesired children 
which come down to us from ancient times are 
in startling contrast to conditions as they exist 
Io

  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
to-day. And while we can but admire the 
practice for its efficacy in solving the problem of 
the degenerate and deformed, and also because 
of the literature which has sprung up in the event 
of the exposed being of royal lineage and op- 
portunely discovered and nourished by shepherds 
or wolves, nevertheless, few would care to return 
to the ancient custom and vest the power of life 
and death in the hands of the father of the family. 
Where the unit of organization was the tribe, 
we discover a division of power. On the one 
hand was the tribal chieftain whose duty it was 
to lead the armed forces in battle against the 
enemies of the tribe, and in the periods between 
wars to act as a guide and a judge for his people. 
On the other hand was the tribal magician or 
medicine man whose function was to intercede 
between man and the unseen and incomprehen- 
sible forces of the universe, often to advise the 
chieftain himself as to the most auspicious time 
for the inception of a projected military un- 
dertaking.~ The relative power of these two 
branches differed among the different tribes, and 
at different periods within the same tribe. 
2. Religious authority. The religious author- 
ity, the man who pointed out the way to follow 
by his familiarity with the unseen is a familiar 
II
-P-A-G-E-24
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
character in the mythology of any people. 
Whether his acts were directed by tradition, as 
was usually the case, or by his own whim, he was 
looked upon with awe because of his intimacy 
with mysterious forces. What schoolboy does 
not know of the ‘heap big magic’ of the medicine 
man of our American Indians? The Hebrew 
people with their Oriental contacts had their 
wise men and soothsayers who gradually became 
supplanted by the prophets as advisers to and at 
times commanders of the king. The Greeks and 
Romans with their Egyptian heritage, had their 
priests (and sometimes priestesses) to interpret 
the will of the gods for man, sometimes with the 
aid of an oracle, and sometimes by signs and por- 
tents that only they could properly interpret. 
Sometimes the truth was represented as being 
revealed directly to the person consulted. In the 
Celtic legend related by Scott in his Lady of the 
Lake, Brian the Hermit is consulted by the High- 
land Chieftain, and in order to give his augury 
must needs lie all night in a wild and lonely glen 
wrapped in the warm hide of a newly slain bull. 
Only in the most primitive tribes, however, is 
the Man alone the revealer of the truth. Only 
where tradition is the only teacher does the 
medicine man have just such power. Where a 
I2

  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
written language has grown up, there is gradually 
collected a body of writings often held as sacred 
to which recourse is to be had for guidance. 
These may be the codification of earlier usages, 
or they may be the writings or utterances of a 
great prophet and teacher, or they come from so 
distant a past that their origin is lost in the far 
obscurity of time. But whatever their source, 
such a group of writings in nearly every country 
has served to furnish guidance to the Man. The 
priest or prophet could quote from the Book and 
thus enhance his authority. 
This book might be the code of Hammurabi or 
the Mosaic code. It might purport to be the 
writings of some prehistoric Asiatic prophet, or a 
later disciple, a Confucius ora Mohammed. The 
awe with which the Book can be looked upon 
as a solution of individual problems can be su- 
premely illustrated in comparatively recent times, 
for reports are well authenticated of people who 
have opened the Bible at random and blindly 
pointed to the page. The verse thus selected by 
chance was expected to furnish the guidance 
sought. 
Along with the authority of the Man and the 
Book, there developed the Organization. This 
was apt to be a group of priests or prophets whose . 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
duty it was to interpret the Book. Sometimes, 
as in the case of the oracles of Greece and the 
Colleges of Augury in Rome, their sources of in- 
spiration were more primitive. But as a body of 
doctrine came to be developed, the Organization 
came to have greater and greater power, so that, 
for instance, in Egypt and in India it was a sepa- 
rate social order with special privileges. Some- 
thing of the sort came about in Medieval Europe 
with the extended power of the Roman Church 
and the appearance of priestly orders. 
3- Civil authority. This same sequence — the 
Man, the Book, the Organization — is to be 
found, likewise, on the civil arm of the social 
order. The tribal chieftain profited by his po- 
sition of power gained by physical strength or 
shrewdness of judgment and his ability to lead, 
and became the emperor or the sultan or the king 
or duke, commanding the subservience of the 
people and maintaining himself with pomp and 
splendor, particularly if he derived his heritage 
from Asiatic sources. According to his strength 
he had power over the religious authorities or did 
them abject obeisance. The fiction gained ac- 
ceptance that the king could do no wrong by the 
simple logic that anything was right if he did it. 
And the people were pleased to have some one 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
  
  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
to take the responsibility for matters concerning 
which they were only periodically interested. 
This convenience spread to literature. In 
Shakespeare’s plays, for example, even when the 
dénouement is inherent in the situation, Fate 
often has to have an august spokesman, as when 
Portia quotes the law to Shylock’s discomfiture, 
and final disposal of the case is made by the Duke 
flanked by his magnificos. 
As an aid or at times as a hindrance to the regal 
_personage there was the Book, or the body of 
written law, possibly identical with the religious 
writings, possibly of separate origin, made up of 
decrees of former sovereigns perhaps codified. 
These were sometimes disregarded, and some- 
times they had real significance like the law of the 
Medes and Persians. 
Another source of the code of Law was the 
Organization, which appeared from time to time 
to hamper the free movements of the despot. 
These enactments had greater or less force among 
different peoples and at different times. Whether 
this organization was an oligarchy or a parlia- 
ment, or whatever form it took, it was a source of 
appeal, a dispenser of truth, a regulator of lives 
and institutions. Its only rival was organized 
religion. So we have, on the one hand, organ- 
15
-P-A-G-E-28
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
ized religious authority, or the Church, and on 
the other, organized civil authority, or the State. 
Education and Authority 
In early times in nearly all countries authority 
furnished the aim and content of education. In 
China, the formal education of children began 
and often ended by a study of the writings of 
Confucius; in India by a study of the Vedas; in 
Palestine by a study of the Old Testament and 
other writings; in New England by a study of the 
Bible and later a primer based largely upon it. 
In these countries the religious rather than the 
civic influence was strong, though many of the 
books studied: were largely secular in content. 
In Greece, Homer was read; in Ancient Rome, 
the Twelve Tables. 
Not only was the subject-matter of education 
largely prescribed by such authority, but often 
the method as well, as illustrated by the words of 
advice in the book of Proverbs, or the minute 
directions as to schoolroom deportment con- 
tained in the writings of Confucius. 
What the Book lacked in this respect was made 
up for by the Organization, sometimes religious 
as in India, Egypt, and medieval Europe; some- 
times civil as in Persia, Sparta, and Rome. To- 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
day, we have both kinds of control as in the 
United States where a parochial system is in 
operation side by side with a state system. 
Before going further, it should be noted that 
as civilization gradually became more complex, 
there came men, books, and organizations exer- 
cising authority in their particular domain, sepa- 
rate from and for the most part independent of 
the ecclesiastical and civil authority of which we 
have been speaking. Either Church or State 
was considered free to step in and regulate or 
control these at any time, though they have some- 
times had to fight for this prerogative; but except 
in such cases, these other bodies were practically 
autonomous. Frequently they were considered 
parts of the larger and more inclusive organiza- 
tion like the military forces of a nation; some were 
more separate, like the applied arts, engineering, 
and the trades, or the fine arts. 
Education, like these others, gradually de- 
veloped a loosely organized body of knowledge 
and a more loosely organized body of workers. 
Limited by a paucity of appropriate material as 
furnished by the Book or the Organization of 
Church or State, individual workers, sometimes 
as an integral part of these organizations, some- 
times working more independently, themselves 
17
-P-A-G-E-30
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
became the Men, themselves became the writers 
of the Books, themselves became the founders of 
the Organizations to carry on the work of educa- 
tion. 
Sources of Professional Knowledge 
1. Custom. And what was the source of this 
knowledge? Scientificinvestigation? No. One 
source was to be found in the adherence to custom. 
The things which had been done continued to be 
done. Anglo-Saxon agriculturists employed cer- 
tain rather intricate charms and incantations with 
an overlay of their more recently acquired Chris- 
tianity.! The potency of these charms we might 
now question. The American Indians told the 
early settlers of this continent to put a fish in each 
hill of corn they planted: this was less poetic than 
the Anglo-Saxon method, but it probably was of 
greater value though the Indians could not have 
told why. Similarly, in education, and with no 
knowledge of the why, as settlements grew into 
villages, and villages into cities with the west- 
ward movement of the population, the schools 
1A number of these may be found in Cook and Tinker, 
Select Translations from Old English Poetry (Ginn & Co., 1902), 
and in Thorndike, Lynn, History of Magic and Experimental 
Science (The Macmillan Company, 1923).

which sprang up followed custom blindly, with 
their eight-year elementary school and their four- 
year high school. 
Sometimes custom has proved to be an able 
teacher. Oftener the later introduction of con- 
siderable modifications brought marked im- 
provement. The origins of the many commonly 
accepted customs are usually buried in antiquity, 
and even the source of such a comparatively 
recent thing as the 8-4 organization of public 
school grades is shrouded in uncertainty. Many 
factors are at work. If we may judge from such 
usages as are traceable, many of them may be 
derived from the speculations of some vigorous 
personality, speculations which were followed by 
conviction even though founded upon no rock 
stratum of fact, and which were perhaps con- 
structed by him and put to use during his lifetime. 
2. Empirical Findings. Such speculations or 
guesses based upon little more than a trial-and- 
error experience of one individual are often called 
empirical. We have seen illustrations of em- 
pirical agriculture. In the early days people used 
to talk about an empirical doctor, one whose skill 
lay chiefly in the things he had figured out for 
himself after a period of blundering and guess- 
work. There was little opportunity for one to 
19
-P-A-G-E-32
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
profit by the experience of another. Each did 
his own blundering, made his own trials, and the 
errors were taken care of by the undertaker. The 
medical school, with its complete equipment both 
in apparatus and in knowledge based on careful 
scientific work over long periods of years and de- 
rived from the efforts of investigators the world 
over, presents an interesting contrast to the em- 
pirical doctor of a few generations ago. 
It comes as a shock to realize that a great deal 
of what goes on under the name of education 
shows a greater likeness to the work of the em- 
pirical doctor than to the work of the medical 
school. Teachers discover their own ways to 
meet situations after months and even years of 
blundering, and then perhaps they have dis- 
covered only mediocre ways, and this is what is 
so much prized under the glamor of the word 
‘Experience.’ Young men who act as principals 
of schools are left to figure things out for them- 
selves and mimic the ways of the principals they 
knew, and are often ignorant of the accumulated 
experience of others that is being made available 
for them. The empirical educator is fast be- 
coming the museum relic that the empirical 
doctor has become. Perhaps the reason this did 
not happen sooner is that though his trials are 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
no less blind, his errors are not so striking. In- 
stead of physical death, they result only in such 
things as waste of time and money, dreary useless 
monotony, petty unpleasantness or unnecessary 
disciplinary situations, in dislike of pupils for 
intellectual activities, and often in hatred and 
ridicule of the whole process including the people 
operating it. 
The one hopeful thing about this type of em- 
pirical professionalism was that it had a tendency 
to break with authority. If a new situation 
arose, a new way to deal with it had to be devised; 
and whereas the time-sanctioned authoritative 
regulations might have handled the situation 
more adequately, there was always a chance that 
occasionally something better might be devised. 
3- Speculation. If we shift the emphasis in the 
question of the solution of problems from meet- 
ing an immediate difficulty which has to be 
handled at once, like a baffling disease, or an in- 
surrection in the school, to deliberating more at 
leisure in the quest for general truths or principles 
which might later be applied to such acute situa- 
tions should they arise, we find ourselves in the 
hopeful period of speculation which oftentimes 
preceded vigorous advances in the various fields 
of knowledge.

Descartes is usually considered the arch- 
modernist when it comes to distrusting the au- 
thoritative dicta of the past. He seems to be 
the supreme doubter of all time among the in- 
tellectuals. Schooled in Aristotelian logic, he 
knew the inexorable nature of its processes, 
which, however, often led to conclusions that 
became increasingly untenable as_ scientific 
activity progressed, and he came to realize that 
the weakness was in the premises. Grant certain 
premises and certain conclusions are irrefutable. 
The medieval mind was credulous: it had not 
trained itself to question premises; it had been 
schooled to accept them from whatsoever author- 
ity was dominant. It had not learned to dis- 
tinguish facts from thought about facts; that is, 
doctrines. 
Descartes saw so many fine structures reared 
on mountains of ice that crumbled as soon as the 
warm breath of science melted the foundations, 
that he questioned every construction of thought. 
He suspected every woodpile of secreting the 
African he had found lurking in so many. He had 
the attitude that is so valuable nowadays when 
listening to the plausible selling talk of an im- 
passioned salesman, that there is a ‘catch’ some- 
where. He went so far as to distrust his own 
22

THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
senses and to wonder if the people who passed 
him in the street were really there, were really 
people, or if his idea that they were there was 
also error. Such a reaction against authority was 
bound to have a wholesome effect in that among 
other things it would call men’s attention to the 
distinction between what they were pleased to 
call facts, and what were mental constructions 
concerning the facts. 
One sort of speculation which properly belongs 
in the pre-scientific period, though it is all too 
prevalent even to-day, is rationalization. The 
technical meaning of this term has been made 
common property by Robinson in his Mind in 
the Making. . When one holds to an opinion 
derived from no clearly recognized source, usually 
from one’s father, or community or church or 
party, etc., and then seeks to justify that opinion 
or prejudice by some form of reasoning, main- 
taining that the opinion is held because it is the 
result of such reasoning, the process is called 
rationalization. A man may say that he belongs 
to a certain religious denomination because he 
agrees with its tenets, and that he votes the Re- 
publican ticket because he believes in the protec- 
tive tariff; whereas he belongs to the denomina- 
tion, votes the Republican ticket and believes in 
23
-P-A-G-E-36
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
the protective tariff because his father did before 
him. He had not broken away from the force of 
authority. Rationalization is finding a plausible 
reason for the belief that is in us, and there are 
some cynics who go so far as to say that the whole 
history of philosophy is nothing more than an 
intricate framework of rationalization reared to 
support preconceived opinions. 
In direct opposition to rationalization is the 
true attitude of the man of science (the attitude 
may be held by philosophers as well) which, in- 
stead of holding to an opinion through thick and 
thin, supporting it by one argument after an- 
other, cautiously seeks to find out the truth, and 
is content when he has found it, whether it turns 
out to be in accord with his original opinion in the 
matter or not. Louis Pasteur exhibited that at- 
titude, and he was perhaps as nearly an incarna- 
tion of the scientific spirit as the world will ever 
see. When the reverberations of his painstaking 
research disproving spontaneous generation had 
attracted the attention not only of scientists but 
of people generally and had seemed to destroy 
the foundation of their pet theories derived they 
knew not whence, he spoke to them in a language 
they could hardly understand. Instead of taking 
the attitude of one who would support a philo- at 24
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY 
sophical theory he said: “It is a question of fact; 
when I took it up I was as ready to be convinced 
by experiments that spontaneous generation ex- 
ists as I am now persuaded that those who now 
believe it are blindfolded.” 4 
Speculation may be said to hold the middle 
ground between authority and science as a 
method for deriving answers to our questions and 
establishing principles. There is one kind of 
speculation which approaches very close to the 
spirit of science in that the opinions derived from 
it come from no hidden sources and need no 
rationalization to give them credence. For the 
attitude of one who uses this method is in one 
respect the attitude of the scientist: he will accept 
the results of the process and follow where it 
leads. 
‘Armchair’ inquiry is the name which was 
given in derision by the psychologists to this kind 
of speculation, for, owing to the nature of their 
subject-matter, they have numbered many em- 
ploying it in their ranks. Clearly the advantage 
of throwing off the incubus of authority and 
marching forth to whatever places the mind 
discloses, unburdened by any preconceived no-

Co., 1923), p- 112. ; 25

tions is a real one. But as a final solution to 
problems of the mind, even, it has certain de- 
finite disadvantages which tend to be corrected 
by the more rigid method of science. Its con- 
clusions are often true, but quite as often wide 
of the mark, and are not dependable for they are 
drawn from too few cases, and are necessarily in- 
fluenced to a large degree by the experiences of 
the man himself, the progress of knowledge, and 
social and economic structures and the ideas 
prevalent at the time in which he lived. 
And yet, if he is a forceful personality, or a 
vigorous writer, even though his conclusions are 
derived from no closer contact with reality than 
an armchair comfortably placed before a cheerful 
log fire, he will himself become an authority, be 
bowed down to and followed by his generation 
and by generations to come until a scientific 
attack on the problems with which he dealt 
begins the work of separating the true from the 
false. Meanwhile his influence has not been all 
harmful, for he has attracted attention to the 
problem, his solutions may be well along the way 
to truth, and he has perhaps aroused the ardor 
of more careful investigators.

would afford an abundance of illustrative ma- 
terial. In the field of education so closely related 
to it, perhaps the work of Herbart might be taken 
as an example. ‘There is no evidence to show 
that this man whose life was spent as a college 
professor based his educational pronouncements 
on anything more than his own armchair specu- 
lation. Yet they were put into practice, and 
when they reached this country they created a 
furor, and his words were on all lips. Correlation, 
concentration, apperception, five formal steps 
of the recitation — the 1890’s accepted these as 
the law and the gospel, and when the furor 
calmed down in the 1900’s it was found that no 
small amount of good had been done, and that 
though much should be discarded much could be 
retained, and practice and experimentation alone 
could determine which was which. 
4. Scientific Inquiry. But custom, empirical 
findings, and speculation though they accom- 
plished much, lacked the adequacy which seemed 
to be proffered by the example of the use of the 
scientific method as employed by the natural 
sciences. Before considering how this method 
is applicable to other fields of professional know- 
ledge, let us turn aside to examine more carefully 
what the scientific method is.

SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE: PROBLEM-SOLVING 
_ The Emergence of the Scientific Method 
One of the most familiar and dramatic illustra- 
tions of the use of the scientific method as over 
against the appeal to authority is found in the 
classic story of Galileo and his experimentation 
with falling bodies. When not long ago I made 
a pilgrimage to Pisa and climbed that seemingly 
endless spiral staircase up the famous Leaning 
Tower, I could but think of how that man of long 
ago had laboriously climbed these same three 
hundred well-worn steps time after time because 
he had anidea. And in order to verify that idea, 
he employed this laborious method, preferring 
it to authority, preferring it to consulting Man, 
Book, or Organization for his answer. And be- 
cause he did this thing, the world gained a new 
truth. No longer could any but the ignorant - 
assume that the heavier a body is the faster it 
falls, because he had demonstrated that all bodies 
fall at the same rate, no matter how much they 
weigh, barring the influence of atmospheric resist- 
ance. He knew because he had resorted to the 
28
-P-A-G-E-41
PROBLEM-SOLVING 
ridiculously simple device of dropping weights 
from this convenient height and timing their fall. 
And then the other factor, atmospheric resistance, 
could be considered by itself. For when, later, 
a feather and a coin were placed in a glass tube, 
and the air was exhausted from it, they fell to- 
gether when the tube was reversed. They be- 
haved according to the prediction. The hy- 
pothesis was verified. If any one did not believe, 
he could repeat the experiments, and he would 
get the same results. (The Method had been 
established. ) : 
When Copernicus discovered that men in 
ancient times had considered it likely that the 
earth was not the stationary center of the uni- 
verse as the majority in their pride supposed, 
but that it was possibly a comparatively small 
spherical body whirling on its own axis and mov- 
ing around the sun, he set to work humbly to 
study the problem. After years of employment 
of the Method, clumsy and full of error as his 
work was, he arrived at conclusions that to 
the many seemed ridiculous and to the church 
seemed dangerous. Galileo, following the work 
of Copernicus, following his method, convinced 
himself of the truth of his conclusions and be- 
came a staunch supporter of the Copernican as 
29 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
over against the more flattering Ptolemaic 
Theory. Judging by its action in the matter, the 
Organization considered such deviation from the 
usual as dangerous and subversive of its doc- 
trines. The Inquisition was on, and poor Galileo 
was proclaimed a heretic and had the choice of 
recanting or suffering the consequences. He 
decided on the former course. Probably he 
considered that what he said or did not say 
would have very little influence on the actual 
movement of the heavenly bodies; and he was no 
doubt scientist enough to believe that in this 
particular at least, the Organization would have 
no more effect. So on his knees in Rome this old 
man, now past seventy, according to the proper 
and wordy form completely and abjectly re- 
canted. Whether or not the story is true that up- 
on rising he muttered, ‘‘It does move, though,” ! 
the situation at least showed that the Organiza- 
tion was still on top, that Authority was master. 
And the story is not finished even to-day. The 
Organization may or may not be ecclesiastical, 
and the method may or may not be applied to 
the physical sciences alone. But if the findings 
by the use of the Method are contrary to the 
well established teachings of the Authority, be it 
1 Eppur si muove.

PROBLEM-SOLVING 
Man, Book, or Organization, there is certain to 
be conflict; for those of the Organization seem 
never able to learn that they do not have control 
over the uniformities of nature, which are gradu- 
ally and painstakingly being discovered and called 
laws — that they are operative any way, and no 
abjuration, or punishment of the finder of them, 
and no amount of invective will change them in 
the least. 
Of course, Galileo was not the first to swear 
allegiance to the Method rather than to the 
Organization in the matter of the nature of the 
universe. The beginnings run far back into 
antiquity. I would not doubt that the first man 
to think of digging canals and constructing reser- 
voirs in Old Egypt was buried alive in the sand 
because he proposed to hamper the free move- 
ments of Father Nile. The first scientists of 
Greece, the cosmic philosophers, whose interest- 
ing speculations as to the ultimate nature of 
things have come down to us, were as truly free- 
thinking individuals as Galileo, though their 
Method needed later elaboration. Their spirit 
was the spirit of science. 
The physical sciences emerged comparatively 
early from the realm of speculative philosophy, 
and were hastened by the discovery of the tele- 
31 
   
-P-A-G-E-44
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
scope and other mechanical devices. The bio- 
logical sciences broke away from fantastic specu- 
lation and authoritative pronouncements still 
later, being given a tremendous impetus by the 
invention of the microscope. Nearly all the 
conflicts of the physical sciences with preéstab- 
lished authority have died down. Those with 
the biological sciences even now flame up oc- 
casionally so as to attract notice, as for example 
in the difficulties that certain men are having 
with evolution. These men are just the descend- 
ants, intellectually of the inquisitors of Galileo, 
who could not reconcile the Copernican theory 
with what they had been taught. 
The social sciences are even now beginning to 
unroll; and while some conflicts have already 
appeared over the edge of the horizon, the con- 
flicts of the social sciences with Authority are for 
the most part in the future. Findings are too 
tentative, as yet; they are not widely known or 
fully understood; their implications are not 
sufficiently appreciated. We of the present can, 
therefore, watch these groups of studies like so- 
ciology, geography, civics, psychology (though 
here the relationship to the biological sciences 
is perhaps closer), and education slowly beginning 
to emerge from the chrysalis.

Scientific Resulis and Scientific Inquiry 
To those whose sole acquaintance with scien- 
tific procedure comes through reading popular 
articles, or even to those who are familiar only 
with the scientific journals and the results there 
presented in their most concise form, the scien- 
tific method must necessarily seem a most exact 
process with no false steps, with everything in 
its place and leading directly to the inevitable 
conclusion. How different this is from the fact 
is most easily ascertained simply by reading the 
story of the discovery of some truth or law by a 
Kepler or a Newton or a Pasteur. 
It is very like the child learning to do long 
division. “How do you know how many times 
the divisor is contained in the first digits of the 
dividend?” he asks, and is surprised to find that 
he has to guess. He was expecting some hard- 
and-fast rule, and even the teacher has to try 
two or three times occasionally, just as he does. 
True, there are certain little schemes he can em- 
ploy to help. He can use just the first digit in 
the divisor, and that may give him a hint, but he 
can’t be sure. He can’t know until he tries it 
out. 
Little do the uninitiated realize the pains-

taking trying-out process that precedes the dis- 
covery and verification even of the most minute 
discoveries of science. How much more, then, 
the major discoveries! They do not come about 
by a “stroke of genius” except as the genius is 
able to devise innumerable situations to test out 
the trials which he makes. 
The lecture from which the following extract 4 
is taken was delivered by Pasteur in 1864. It 
took him only about an hour to repeat some of 
his experiments and explain his conclusions in a 
most vivid manner in the large, crowded lecture 
room of the Sorbonne. How simple and clear are 
his statements: 
I place a portion of that infusion into a flask with 
a long neck (like this one). Suppose I boil the liquid 
and leave it to cool. After a few days, mouldiness 
or animalculz will develop in the liquid. By boiling, 
I destroyed any germs contained in the liquid or 
against the glass; but that infusion being again in 
contact with air, it becomes altered, as all infusions 
do. Now suppose I repeat this experiment, but that, 
before boiling the liquid, I draw (by means of an 
enameller’s lamp) the neck of the flask into a point, 
leaving, however, its extremity open. This being

lishers.

~ PROBLEM-SOLVING 
done, I boil the liquid in the flask, and leave it to cool. 
Now the liquid of this second flask will remain pure 
not only two days, a month, a year, but three or four 
years — for the experiment I am telling you about is 
already four years old, and the liquid remains as 
limpid as distilled water. What difference is there, 
then, between those two vases? They contain the 
same liquid, they both contain air, both are open. 
Why does one decay and the other remain pure? The 
only difference between them is this: in the first case, 
the dusts suspended in air and their germs can fall 
into the neck of the flask and arrive into contact with 
the liquid, where they find appropriate food and 
develop; thence microscopic beings. In the second 
flask, on the contrary, it is impossible, or at least 
extremely difficult, unless it is violently shaken, that 
dusts suspended in air should enter the vase; they fall 
on its curved neck. When air goes in and out of the 
vase through diffusions or variations of tempera- 
ture, the latter never being sudden, the air comes in 
slowly enough to drop the dusts and germs that it 
carries at the opening of the neck or in the first 
curves. 
This experiment is full of instruction; for this must 
be noted, that everything in air save its dusts can 
easily enter the vase and come into contact with 
the liquid. Imagine what you choose in the air — 
electricity, magnetism, ozone, unknown forces even, 
all can reach the infusion. Only one thing cannot 
enter easily, and that is dust, suspended in air. And 
the proof of this is that if I shake the vase violently 
35  
-P-A-G-E-48
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
two or three times, in a few days it contains animal- 
cule or mouldiness. Why? Because air has come 
in violently enough to carry dust with it. Never will 
the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from 
the mortal blow of this simple experiment. 
But what preceded this simple experiment, 
what was Pasteur’s preparation for this lecture? 
Six years of the most constant and painstaking 
labor. Although the cruder belief that rats could 
be created out of cheese and old rags had largely 
gone into the discard, the ghost of spontaneous 
generation had begun to walk with the discovery, 
by means of the microscope, of a world swarming 
with life of which no one had dreamed, and so 
teeming with minute organisms that spontaneous 
generation seemed the only answer as to their 
origin. Certain scientific men of the period 
went so far as to claim that they could prove that 
these microscopic animals and plants could be 
generated without any connection with other 
germs. 
The story of this controversy is as dramatic 
and as full of human interest as any fiction. In 
the course of his experimentation, Pasteur in- 
vented various devices to keep out the air and the 
contents of the air from the liquids in his flasks. 
He tried various kinds of flasks inventing many 
36
-P-A-G-E-49
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
new shapes; he tried boiling different liquids in 
these different flasks for different periods of time, 
all the while examining with his microscope to 
find the influence of the different situations. To 
discover if air at different places contains vary- 
ing quantities of these microscopic creatures, 
he carried especially prepared flasks containing 
the same liquid to different places, city streets, 
country roads, cellars, even high up in the Alps. 
Many times in each of these different places he 
broke the neck of a flask allowing the air to rush 
in, then skilfully sealed it again and took them 
all back to his laboratory for careful examination. 
A few minutes to tell; nearly six years of pains- 
taking effort to discover and prove. 
And it is the same story for every discovery. 
In the field of psychology Ebbinghaus in the 
course of his experimentation memorized 21,312 
nonsense syllables besides many practice series 
before he gave us the laws of learning and for- 
getting. Little idea can be gained from reading 
the conclusions of a scientific labor, of the path 
followed and the unsuccessful trials made by the 
experimenter before he is able to reach them. 
This long process of reflective thinking is an 
integral part of the scientific method and will now 
be considered in detail.

Problem-Solving 
1. Seeing problems. In the first place there 
must be some starting point. It may not at first 
have the definiteness of a problem; it may be just 
a feeling of insufficiency in a certain situation, 
a lack of contentment, a feeling of dissatisfaction 
in the face of certain conditions or pronounce- 
ments, an attitude of questioning or doubt, per- 
haps in regard to certain generally accepted ideas. 
The idea of spontaneous generation, for example, 
in the time of Pasteur, was gaining credence in 
view of the swarming billions of creatures re- 
vealed by the microscope. Where did they come 
from? Here was the difficulty. To Pasteur, the 
answer that they came into being spontaneously 
without parent cells was a dubious one. Here 
was his difficulty, his problem; so he set about the 
task of finding the solution. Copernicus was 
dissatisfied with the accepted explanation of the 
movement of the heavenly bodies, and getting a 
different idea from certain ancient writings, he 
set to work on his problem. Illustrations are by 
no means confined to the physical sciences. 
Many of us have certain half-formed opinions 
concerning superior children — that if they are 
particularly brilliant in one direction they are 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
PROBLEM-SOLVING , 
deficient in others —perhaps in the social graces 
or in healthy physical development, or that they 
are not thus deficient, but instead that they are 
superior in practically all respects. Here is a 
real difficulty, and Terman has decided to resolve 
it by making a study of approximately one thou- 
sand superior children, taking careful measures 
in every possible fashion. The results of his 
investigation will not be complete until these 
children have grown and demonstrated by their 
lives whether their early promise is to be fulfilled. 
The influence of heredity, the dynamic value of 
instinct and habit, the transfer value of different 
subjects and different methods of instruction, 
the place of vocational advisement and training 
in the schools — these are just a few samples 
selected at random from the many problems that 
confront educators to-day, problems which are 
crying for a solution, problems which cannot be 
satisfactorily answered by any blind following 
of custom, by any appeal to authority, or by any 
resort to individual opinion no matter how well 
thought out it may be. The slow, painstaking 
method of science is the only direction in which 
we may look for any answer in which to place 
any real confidence. 
Individuals differ greatly in their ability to see 
39
-P-A-G-E-52
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
problems. Oftentimes students finish college 
and go on to graduate school before they dis- 
cover that they need to do some original research 
before they will be awarded a graduate degree. 
So they confer with some member of the graduate 
faculty and ask him for a problem to work on; 
they can’t seem to think of any. Can’t think of 
any, and the world fairly bursting with them! 
A friend of mine, a young professor of philos- 
ophy, has occasionally expressed considerable 
dismay at the lack of ability on the part of his 
students to see problems. They are so content 
with everything. The world is all right as it is, 
especially if they succeed in having a good time. 
Of the problems crying for solution in the state 
and nation, in the social structure of our twen- 
tieth century,— of these they are blissfully un- 
aware. And he wonders if after all it is his duty 
to call their attention to these problems. If he 
does they either evince little interest, or at most 
are but momentarily disturbed, and they seem 
quite unable to do anything about it, quite in- 
capable of closing with any one of them and ex- 
acting a solution. Should he call the attention 
of his students to these problems? That in itself 
isaproblem. : 
It is at this point that the problem-project 
40
-P-A-G-E-53
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
method of which we have heard so much of late 
has an opportunity to be of real service. Perhaps 
it isn’t the fault of these students that life pre- 
sents no real difficulties, that they are unable 
to see problems. Little opportunity has been 
afforded them. They have lived in the era of the 
rule of authority, even though it is the twentieth 
century. Their problems as well as the technique 
of solving them have been furnished ready-made. 
They have always been told what to do. Their 
parents first and then their teachers joined the 
authoritative band. “Take the next ten pages; 
do the next twenty examples; translate the next 
fifty lines.” Obediently they buckle down and 
do as much of what they are told as they consider 
necessary. Why should they discover problems 
for themselves? They have never been taught 
to. As well expect the boy who has spent all his 
life in the city to see a squirrel peeking out from 
the other side of a tree trunk with the quickness 
of perception of the boy who has lived in the 
woods all his life. The scientific method is a 
method of solving problems, and the first pre- 
requisite is to see the problem. 
The felt difficulty may be due to a complex of 
situations, and a little time spent in analysis will 
usually unearth a whole nest of problems, each one 
41  
-P-A-G-E-54
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
of which may require a different method of attack. 
It is in such a situation as this that the begin- 
ning teacher often finds himself. He may have 
had excellent preliminary training including 
practice teaching. But when he gets away from 
the kindly influence of his teachers and super- 
visors and into a different, perhaps inferior school 
system, he is quite apt to turn against the whole 
situation and become discouraged at his inability 
to make good at his new job. He has difficulties 
enough; the situation is full of them. If he is 
wise, he will analyze it to see what the different 
problems are, such as getting on with his im- 
mediate superior, bringing about the purchase 
of new equipment, discovering which of his 
pupils are at the center of the trouble-making; 
what is the best method of handling them; of 
gaining the good will of his pupils, of his col- 
leagues, and of the people in his community, 
and at the same time standing by the things 
which he considers best. 
People often make the mistake of applying one 
remedy to a complex of disorders. We frequently 
hear persons pretentiously announce what the 
world needs, when they have only the shadiest 
idea of the complexity of the problems they 
would solve so easily. The beginner in scientific

investigations is apt to attempt the solution of 
too big a difficulty, and be impatient with the 
seeming pettiness with which he is brought face 
to face after he selects one of the problems into 
which he has analyzed his total situation. 
2. Discovery of the solution. But it is one thing 
to see difficulties and quite another to think of 
solutions. Whatever care is used in analyzing 
the situation, whatever thought is used in dis- 
covering and isolating the problem, at least one 
solution must offer itself. How seldom one solu- 
tion is sufficient has already been intimated. 
Many solutions will usually have to present them- 
selves before the correct one is discovered. 
Just as people differ greatly in their ability to 
see problems, so too, do they differ in the rapidity 
and ease with which suggestions come to them. 
It is probably true that this ability can be im- 
proved by training, but to how great an extent is 
unknown. Certainly those scientists who have 
made contributions of major importance had the 
ability to a very marked degree. Sir Francis 
Galton has left us a most illuminating account of 
his thought processes as he had observed them, 
when he was confronted by a problem: *

ment (The Macmillan Company, 1883), p. 203.

  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
When I am engaged in trying to think anything 
out, the process of doing so appears to me to be this: 
The ideas that lie at any moment within my full 
consciousness seem to attract of their own accord the 
most appropriate of a number of other ideas that are 
lying close at hand, but imperfectly within the range 
of my consciousness. There seems to be a presence 
chamber in my mind where full consciousness holds 
court, and where two or three ideas are at the same 
time in audience, and an antechamber full of more or 
less allied ideas, which is situated just beyond the 
full ken of consciousness. Out of this antechamber 
the ideas most nearly allied to those in the pres- 
ence chamber appear to be summoned in a mechan- 
ically logical way, and to have their turn of audi- 
ence. 
The successful progress of thought appears to de- 
pend, first, on a large attendance in the antechamber; 
secondly, on the presence there of no ideas except 
such as are strictly germane to the topic under con- 
sideration; thirdly, on the justness of the logical 
mechanism that issues the summons. The thronging 
of the antechamber is, I am convinced, altogether 
beyond my control; if the ideas do not appear, I can- 
not create them nor compel them to come. 
Besides seeing problems and waiting for solu- 
tions to suggest themselves, attention must be 
given to the relative value of the solutions sug- 
gested. They must be examined carefully with 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  PROBLEM-SOLVING | 
a view to their acceptability. The landlord who 
assures his tenant that the explosions of the gas 
heater are due to the ashes on the cellar floor, 
and that the water dropping from the kitchen 
ceiling when it rains is due to the steam pro- 
duced in cooking has greater facility in making 
suggestions than he has ability to evaluate the 
suggestions which he makes. 
A graduate student at one time discovered a 
difference in the heart rate of different individuals 
when considerable pressure was exerted on their 
closed eyes. He decided that this was a gauge of 
musical ability and induced nearly all the mem- 
bers of one of the city bands as well as his fellow 
graduate students to allow him to push in their 
eyeballs to prove his thesis. He certainly hit 
upon a remarkably ingenious solution, but one 
which few would have considered it necessary to 
try out. Sir Francis Galton, according to his 
account, did not experiment upon the helpless 
universe in connection with every suggestion that 
occurred to him. Instead, he viewed the sugges- 
tions a few at a time, accepting some as probable 
and worth working on, rejecting others as un- 
satisfactory. The necessity for doing this is 
obvious. If every suggestion were put to the 
test, so much time would be consumed in fruit- 
45
-P-A-G-E-58
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
less endeavor that little work of real value could 
be done. ‘True, the most likely solutions may 
prove futile, and then the less probable ones may 
be tested, for often the answer lies in the most 
unexpected quarter. 
But how can one know which are the most 
likely solutions? No satisfactory answer can be 
given to this question. Native intelligence, what- 
ever that may be, probably has a great deal to 
do with it, as does particular knowledge, special 
training, and experience. The landlord above 
referred to was probably incapacitated for a 
proper evaluation of his suggestions not only by 
his desire to avoid additional expenditures but 
also by his lack of intelligence. The graduate 
student who sought the seat of musical talent 
in an eye-heart reflex was perhaps lacking in a 
thorough knowledge of physiology. One reason 
that successful investigators are successful is that 
with their training and experience, they are able 
to render expert opinion on matters which an- 
other might spend futile weeks in investigating. 
Their minds are so in tune with their subject- 
matter that at once a proposed solution will be 
deemed reasonable or ridiculous. If it is reason- 
able or acceptable tentatively, it will need still 
further consideration. Its implications will have 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
PROBLEM-SOLVING 
to be considered and tested. In other words, we 
have an hypothesis. 
In his famous speech on Evolution, W. J. 
Bryan makes a great deal of the point that the 
doctrine which he so denounces is called the 
evolutionary hypothesis, and that an hypothesis 
is defined in the dictionary as a ‘guess.’ Then, 
with a fine disregard for logic, he sets forth on a 
trail of fiery invective against the man who would 
put his faith in a ‘mere guess.’ From what has 
already been said, it is clear that an hypothesis 
must be more than a mere guess, and just how 
much more it is worth while now to consider in 
detail. 
Degrees of Certainty 
1.The hypothesis. The hypothesis is a first 
step beyond random. suggestions in the direction 
of _scienti scientific | truth. it is the reasonable a answer 
  ‘true, 2, and 1 the investigator sets out to consider 
what would happen in consequence. If the con- 
sequences of this assumption that the hypothesis 
is true are not in accord with the established facts, 
it must necessarily be rejected as false. Kepler 
made nineteen hypotheses concerning the form 
47 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
of the orbits of the planets, each one of which 
he had to abandon after months of mathematical 
calculation, before he tested the twentieth hy- 
pothesis — that is, that these orbits are elliptical 
—when he found that it alone was in accord 
with the facts. 
The hypothesis is not a proposition the truth 
of which must be supported through thick and 
_ thin in order to convince people and win a de- 
bate or a political contest. It is rather a tempor- 
ary working principle which the scientist is will- 
ing to relinquish whenever the facts favor some 
other hypothesis which, in turn, may or may not 
prove tenable. Thus the path of the scientific 
investigator is strewn with the bodies of slain 
hypotheses. 
The good hypothesis must be in agreement with 
the facts, but this general statement may be 
elaborated so as to present three distinct qual- 
ifications: 
First: it must allow the application of deduc- 
tive reasoning and the inference of consequences 
capable of comparison with the results of ob- 
servation. ‘That is, we should be able to say, 
‘If this tentative hypothesis is true, such and 
such things will follow.’ These things must be 
of such a nature that we can observe whether or 
48
-P-A-G-E-61
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
not they actually do follow. Thus when Pasteur 
formulated the hypothesis that micro-organ- 
isms spring from other organisms like themselves, 
and that these are transmitted with the dust of 
the air, it was easy to infer the possibility of 
studying air without dust, which would con- 
ceivably render impossible the continuance of 
these organisms. 
Conversely, we must be able to say ‘If this 
hypothesis is mot true, such and such things will 
follow.’ That is, to be a good hypothesis it must 
be of such a nature that its invalidity under par- 
ticular circumstances is conceivable. The con- 
sequences of such a condition can then be inferred 
with a view to finding out if they maintain. 
Pasteur could say: “If my hypothesis is not true, 
bacteria will appear in the water from which the 
dust of the air (and hence other bacteria) has 
been excluded.” But they did not appear under 
those conditions. 
An illustration of a condition in which this 
qualification is not fulfilled may be taken from 
the realm of faith-healing. If a cure follows, 
faith is responsible. If a cure does not follow, 
there is not enough faith. In either case, the 
patient’s belief in the therapeutic power of faith 
is unshaken. Indeed since it cannot be dis- 
49 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
proved (or proved either, for that matter) he is 
all the more certain of its validity. 
The second qualification of the good hypothesis 
is that the consequences inferred must agree with 
the observable facts. Here again the hypothesis 
of Pasteur stood the test. The consequence in- 
ferred was that water free from bacilli would re- 
main free from them if not exposed to the dust 
of the air. The observed fact, as reported above, 
was that the water in the curved-necked flask into 
which the dust of the air could not enter under 
normal conditions, remained free from bacilli for 
the four years that the test was being conducted. 
Galileo, from his investigations into the laws of 
falling bodies, formulated the hypothesis that the 
difference in the rate of fall was due not to their 
weight but to atmospheric resistance. If this 
were removed, all would fall together. This was 
subsequently demonstrated with the feather and 
coin in the vacuum as previously described. 
The third qualification of the good hypothesis 
is that it must not conflict with any law of nature 
which we hold to be true. For example, it would 
be a foolhardy experimenter who would set out 
to prove that the fewer the repetitions of a selec- 
tion the longer it can be retained in the memory. 
This is manifestly so at variance with the Law of 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
Frequency or Exercise that it is discarded at once. 
Occasionally a Jacques Loeb or an Einstein arises 
who puts forward hypotheses which question 
certain conclusions of a Pasteur or a Newton. 
But they do it wittingly, just as Copernicus put 
forward an hypothesis at variance with the com- 
monly accepted theory of his day. Exceptions 
to this qualification are clearly necessary, but 
they are only exceptions. : aoe 
2. The theory. If all the consequences possible 
to infer do agree with the facts of observation, / 
the hypothesis becomes either a theory or a law. | 
The theory is a statement of truth as it is be-} 
lieved to exist on the basis of all the facts that/ 
are at handy It is, then, farther along the pat 
to certainty ry than an hypothesis. It carries the 
idea of a wider acceptance than the hypothesis. 
It is a mental construction to account for facts 
as they exist. It has been tested by many in- 
vestigators, and it seems to account for more of 
the facts and account for them better than other 
hypotheses. We have certain phenomena; if 
certain things were true we should have these 
phenomena. Therefore, let us act as if these 
certain things are true and so explain our phe- 
nomena. 
The theory of spontaneous generation was put 
51
-P-A-G-E-64
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
forward to account for the swarming micro- 
organisms. If these creatures came into being 
spontaneously, we should have such conditions 
as we find, argued those supporting the theory. 
They could not imagine parenthood operating on 
such an enormous scale as would be necessary to 
produce so many billions of creatures in so short 
atime. Their theory seemed to be necessary to 
account for the facts. When Pasteur took a 
flask of water with an infusion of these creatures 
in it, killed them all by boiling, and then sealed 
up the flask so that no air could get at the water; 
and when he showed that in this flask no bacilli 
were generated, while they were generated in the 
same kind of water, boiled in the same way but not 
shut off from the air, he destroyed the older theory. 
The electronic theory is generally accepted by 
physicists and chemists at the present time. No 
one has seen an electron. But if there were elec- 
trons, matter would behave as it does. Let us 
therefore assume their existence. On this basis, 
it is possible to account for static electricity, 
current electricity, magnetism, the radiations of 
light, X-rays, chemical action, the atoms of 
matter and their peculiar properties, and the 
phenomena of radio activity.! But still we have 
4 Duncan, R. K.: The New Knowledge (Barnes, 1906), p. 187. 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
PROBLEM-SOLVING 
only a theory for though it accounts for all these 
things, still it does not account for certain other 
phenomena of the universe such as positive 
electricity, gravitation, or life. That theory is 
most acceptable which most simply accounts for 
the greatest number of phenomena. 
An hypothesis which has recently acquired 
sufficient prestige to become a theory is that of 
organic evolution. All the evidence that can be 
brought to bear tends to substantiate it. “But 
it has not been proved,” shouts the narrow re- 
ligionist. “Every biologist will tell you that it 
has not been proved.”’ And of course this is true. 
It has not been proved. Furthermore, at the 
present time there seems no possibility of its 
ever being completely demonstrated. So it is 
with the Copernican Theory which troubled the 
narrow religionists of five hundred years ago. 
It has not been proved, and probably never can 
be. But all the phenomena of the solar system 
as they have been observed seem to need just this 
explanation, and so it is regarded as true. The 
older Ptolemaic theory which it supplanted was 
not able to account for all the phenomena. 
From what has been said, it is clear that there 
is no sharp line that can be drawn between an 
hypothesis and a theory. This is particularly 
53
-P-A-G-E-66
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
true in the newer fields of scientific investigation 
as for example in psychology and education. 
Freud concocts an amazing hypothesis concern- 
ing dreams and their symbolic interpretation, 
and it is called a theory. Other hypotheses con- 
cerning the influence of glands, the nature and 
origin of consciousness, the subconscious, the 
instincts, and the like, have been published 
abroad as if they were well-substantiated theo- 
ties. To the extent that they are used as a 
working basis for further inquiry, they are hypo- 
theses and useful. To the extent that they are 
considered as the best interpretation of the phe- 
nomena, they may be called theories, but as such 
they are dangerous because they are really only 
daring surmises, and because assumptions based 
upon them are more than likely to be untrue and 
to lead to serious error in application, if not to 
positive harm. 
Of course, what is at one time a generally ac- 
cepted theory may at a later time due to an ad- 
vance of knowledge, become quite untenable. 
Just as the path of the scientific investigator is 
strewn with the bodies of rejected hypotheses, so 
the path of science is strewn with the bodies of 
discredited theories. Yet a theory should be 
capable of wider acceptance than the hypothesis 
54
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
and the loose usage which makes them all but 
identical is greatly to be deplored. 
The theory that the brain is the seat of con- 
sciousness, Thorndike’s theory of feeling, or of 
identical elements in the transfer of training, the 
James-Lange theory of the emotions, the con- 
stancy of the I.Q. — these are formulations which 
have sufficient evidence in support of them to 
be called theories, even though they may be 
amended, otherwise corrected, or even eventually 
discredited. 
3. Lhe_law. Some hypotheses become theo- 
ries;“Some become laws. Whether they pass 
through the one stage into the other is im- 
    scientific certainty. It is a Statement of the uni- 
_form behavior of natural phenomena. It is the statement of a relationship that is always found. 
All predictions made on the basis of it invariably 
come out as expected. The law of gravity states 
that the attraction between bodies varies directly 
as their masses, and inversely as the square of the 
distance between them. Here is an out-and-out 
statement of the relationship between bodies, 
arrived at by a long, painstaking process, but 
statable in definite fashion and capable of verifi- 
cation by any expert. It has always been found 
55
-P-A-G-E-68
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
to be reliable, and it is this continual reliability of 
a theory which constitutes its truth. The same 
may be said of Mendel’s law, of the law of for- 
getting as expressed by the curve, of the law of 
exercise. These are statements of uniformity 
which have been found to be universally true. 
Given certain conditions, other conditions in- 
variably follow. The greater the bodies, the 
greater their attraction for each other; the longer 
the lapse of time, the greater the amount that is 
forgotten; the more practice, the stronger, more 
precise and more smooth-running the reaction. 
Natural and Civil Law 
Confusion often arises as to the difference be- 
tween natural and civil law. It is unfortunate 
that the two meanings should employ the same 
word; for there is even more difference between 
them than there is between the meanings of the 
word ‘guess,’ which Mr. Bryan confused. A 
natural law is a statement of uniformity existing 
in the universe; a civil law is a man-made rule of 
conduct, administered by men. It can be dis- 
regarded by those who are willing to run the 
chance of being found out and of suffering punish- 
ment according to the statement of penalty in 
the law. A natural law is discovered after care- 
56
-P-A-G-E-69
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 
ful, painstaking effort; a civil law is formulated 
to suit the desires of law-makers and their con- 
stituents. 
The only sense in which the two are similar is 
in the supposition that a Creator made rules to be 
observed by all creatures as well as by all inani- 
mate objects. The idea of wrongdoing can also 
be injected into this meaning, as when it is used 
in connection with the so-called laws of health. 
If a person eats too much, he is punished by an 
attack of the gout. More broadly, if he dares to 
disregard the law of gravity and jumps off a cliff, 
he is punished by being dashed to pieces. He is 
punished in the same way if he falls asleep and 
rolls off. It is difficult to see why such.severe 
punishment should be meted out to one who 
seems to have done no wrong. This is particu- 
larly true in the case of the less obvious law such 
as those relating to disease, in which man is made 
to discover the laws before he can ‘obey’ them. 
When we carry this idea of punishment of inani- 
mate things like stones crushed under the weight 
of a glacier, the idea becomes still more fanciful. 
No, a civil law is a man-made rule of conduct; a 
natural law is an exact statement of an existing 
uniformity. It is merely a formula and governs 
nothing. . ; 
57

  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
Induction and Deduction 
Deduction without induction is the method of 
reasoning from authority; it is the process of 
drawing conclusions from principles which one 
does not question. These principles or premises 
may have their source in a dim past, they may be 
generally accepted notions of the day, or they 
may be scientific laws — it matters not a whit. 
It is said of certain systems of theology, ‘Grant 
the premises and the conclusions are inescapable.’ 
And rather startling conclusions they often 
are. é 
The medieval mind, as we have seen, was 
peculiarly willing to accept almost any statement 
as a premise and build the most elaborate super- 
structure of reasoning upon it. Copernicus, 
daring innovator that he was in his own day, was 
constantly dependent upon such absurd prin- 
ciples for his reasoning as the following: The 
sphere is the most perfect figure, therefore the 
universe is spherical. It is only given to wholes 
to move circularly, while it is the nature of parts 
separate from their wholes to move in straight 
lines; hence a body falls to the earth. 
The basis of deductive logic is the syllogism; 
for example, 
58
-P-A-G-E-71
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
All men are mortal, 
Socrates is a man, 
Therefore Socrates is mortal. ' 
The deductive logicians were content to consider 
various ways in which the minor premise and 
conclusion might or might not follow from the 
first statement or major premise. In other 
words, they were concerned with the principles 
of proof or demonstration. They were not par- 
ticularly interested in the origin of the major 
premise, the inclusive assumption upon which 
their reasoning was based. 
’ Scientific reasoning must needs use the 
methods of deductive logic, but it first questions 
the major premise which it establishes inductively 
by trying it out in a sufficient number of cases 
to be reasonably sure of its truth. Let us use a 
simple illustration. If I should say, “Guess what 
color this leaf is that I found,” you might say, 
“Green, of course.” Your reasoning could be 
outlined in full as follows: 
All leaves are green, 
This is a leaf, 
Therefore this is green. 
But the scientist is not satisfied with that first 
assumption, the statement contained in the 
59  
-P-A-G-E-72
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
major premise. He therefore proceeds induc- 
tively. He examines leaf after leaf, he examines 
hundreds and thousands of them. In his search 
he finds one that is yellow and one that is red. 
So the conclusion is false because the premise is 
false, though the reasoning is faultless. 
The search for a generalization, an hypothesis 
consists of nothing more than an analysis of case 
after case to see if every one can be included in 
some general formula. Hence it is said that in- 
ductive reasoning moves from particulars to the 
general, while deductive reasoning moves from 
the general, the hypothesis, to the particulars; 
that is, the implications that may be drawn on 
the basis of the known relations. Induction 
establishes the major premise; deduction draws 
the possible conclusions from it for the sake of 
further observation and testing. 
Clearly, in any scientific research, it is im- 
possible to keep the two processes separate, and 
it is unnecessary to do so. Every inference 
drawn from every suggestion that comes to mind 
in the face of a problem is deduction; every care- 
ful search into the phenomena of nature suggest- 
ing some uniformity is induction; every bit of 
reasoning immediately based on any such sus- 
pected uniformity is deduction. The contribu- 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
  
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 
tion of the experimental sciences in this particular 
is the development of rules and principles of in- 
ductive procedure, thus giving certainty to the 
premises from which deduction starts. 
Aristotle, in his master work, The Organon, or 
Instrument, set forth in detail for all time the 
principles and practice of deduction or proof. 
Francis Bacon, a contemporary of Descartes and 
Queen Elizabeth, in his Novum Organum, or 
New Instrument, set forth the principles of in- 
duction with its careful, accurate observation of 
phenomena and avoidance of assumptions, which 
he calls idols, whether they be common modes of 
thought, peculiar views of the individual, twists 
of language, or even sacred traditions from a 
remote past. Bacon’s scientific work was itself 
slight. Nevertheless, coming as he did at a time 
when men’s minds turned toward the investiga- 
tion of natural phenomena, he exerted and has 
continued to exert a tremendous influence.

SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE: INSTRUMENTS OF 
PRECISION 
Mechanical Inventions 
CERTAIN instruments which are peculiarly a part 
of scientific investigation make it more than a 
process of reasoning. These instruments have 
been devised to make observation more accurate 
and conclusions more dependable; and most 
striking of all of these are the mechanical in- 
ventions which have opened up new worlds to 
the investigator. Galileo’s invention of the 
telescope with the subsequent improvements 
which have been made has revealed the dome of 
heaven no longer as the abode of starry divini- 
ties as the ancients saw it, but a place of infinite 
space containing countless whirling worlds which 
before were invisible. The perfection of the com- 
pound microscope brought under man’s observa- 
tion the world of the infinitely minute and raised 
anew many questions as to the origin of life; and 
the discovery of the cells of which living tissue is 
composed has made possible a comprehension of 
life hitherto undreamed of. 
62
-P-A-G-E-75
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
Besides such epoch-making inventions as 
these, the laboratory of the physicist, the chem- 
ist, the biologist, and now the psychologist, is full 
of complicated apparatus to aid him in his work. 
One important group of instruments is for the 
purpose of recording movements so that they may 
be studied at leisure or observed by others. 
This is done by means of a slowly revolving 
smoked drum and tambour. A photographic 
film is even more valuable for such a graphic 
record, as for example, that of the heart beat, of 
respiration, of muscular fatigue, of eye-move- 
ments in reading, and the like. The camera is of 
real value in taking the place of a verbal report of 
conditions, whether they be of geologic forma- 
tions, botanical specimens, or, as it has been re- 
cently used, of facial expressions for the study of 
the emotions which they reveal. 
Another group of instruments consists of those 
which make for greater accuracy in measurement. 
Among these are the balance, thermometer, volt- 
meter, ammeter, barometer, chronoscope, stop- 
watch, etc. Many of these instruments are as 
valuable in educational investigation as they are 
in the natural sciences.

Quantitative Measurement 
The appearance of these many mechanical 
contrivances emphasizes the one great difference 
between ordinary observation and scientific ob- 
servation, a demand for accuracy. It is all 
very well for the sufferer to say that it is hotter 
to-day than it was yesterday, or that he feels 
hotter; but this will not do either in meteorology 
or as a scientific medical diagnosis of fever. 
Greater accuracy is necessary. It is all very well 
for the successful housekeeper of the older gen- 
eration to tell how she makes a cake by putting 
in a pinch of this and a handful of that, and stirs 
till it is about right; but a scientific household 
economist is not satisfied with any such method 
to say nothing of the waste it would mean in a 
large baking establishment. It is all very well 
for the amateur hunter to aim at the bear gen- 
erally, and if he is lucky, the bear will either drop 
or run away; but military science traces the tra- 
jectory of a shell with the most exact precision. 
It is all very well for the ancient Greek to see his 
gods and goddesses in the starlit heavens; but 
astronomy measures the distances between the 
heavenly bodies and traces exactly their move- 
ments through space. It is all very well for the

fight enthusiast to tell how his champion avoided 
his opponent’s thrust just in time; but the psy- 
chologist measures the quickness of different 
kinds of reactions to the thousandth part of a 
second. In the same way the educator must 
have done with his slipshod guesswork, his ‘it 
seems to me’s,’ and his ‘I should think’s.’ If he 
is going to get any further than his predecessors 
he, too, must talk in figures. He, too, must have 
his accurate methods of measurement, and such 
measurements as these are now being developed 
in the form of tests.and scales, which we shall 
consider later. They are mentioned here to 
indicate their correspondence to the other meas- 
ures in the natural sciences. 
But even before any of these instruments can 
be perfected, units of measurement must be de- 
veloped. We who take our inches and yards, our 
quarts and bushels, our ounces and pounds, yes 
and our liters, meters and grams so as a matter 
of course seldom stop to think of the long period 
of difficulty and uncertainty which elapsed be- 
fore these became standardized. Irving Fisher, 
in his effort to demonstrate the practicability of a 
new unit of measure in economics, the stabilized 
dollar, tells very interestingly how the foot was 
originally the length of the chieftain’s foot, and 
65 
   
-P-A-G-E-78
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
the yard the length of his belt, and how a revolu- 
tion might easily play havoc with the national 
system of measures. Only gradually have these 
arbitrary measures gained acceptance and be- 
come standardized, and those who have been 
following European exchange can see the diffi- 
culties in the way of this standardization. 
Then besides the simple linear units, and units 
of weight and capacity are the more complicated 
ones which the natural sciences have evolved, 
such as the light-year of the astronomer, the 
kilowatt-hour of the physicist, the foot-pound 
of the mechanical engineer, etc. The very fact 
| that these have appeared along with the develop- 
ment of the different sciences is reason for in- 
ferring their necessity. And this inference can 
besubstantiated by asking the workers in these 
fields if they couldn’t get along just as well with- 
out them. 
It is therefore natural to see similar develop- 
ments in the field of education as the search for 
answers to its problems comes to take over the 
methods of science. One of the earliest and most 
important units was that employed by Binet — 
the mental age. This unit of measurement pro- 
bably has done more than any other one thing to 
hasten the development of scientific method in 
66 :
-P-A-G-E-79
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
education. Other units, some of them dependent 
in part upon it, are the intelligence quotient, the 
educational quotient and the acomplishment 
quotient — units of measurement which are now 
in the process of being standardized. Other il- 
lustrations can be drawn from the fields of sta- 
tistics, as for example, the median, the standard 
deviation, the probable error, the coefficient of 
correlation. For an educator not to know the 
significance of these units of measurement is as 
unfortunate as it is for a physicist not to know 
what is meant by an ohm or a wave-length, or 
for a biologist to register ignorance when a micron 
is mentioned. 
The Experiment 
The experiment is the most characteristic part 
of scientific procedure and most essential to it. 
It is apt to be futile, it is true, without the careful 
observation that must accompany all scientific 
investigation, without the mechanical inventions, 
and the units of quantitative measurement. 
But these are recognized and necessary aids 
to it. 
Another essential in the use of experiment is 
the trained experimenter. He must be trained in 
the knowledge of the field in which he works, 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
and he must be trained in the technique of hand- 
ling the intricate apparatus which is at his dis- 
posal. Few would deny that the chemist should 
be well trained not only that he may present 
trustworthy results, but, as in the case of his 
working with high explosives, that he may not 
be a menace to those around him. He must be 
trained to detect the most minute deviations 
in his test tube or on his slide, deviations which 
the ordinary observer would not even see, much 
less consider significant. But just such slight 
changes as these in movement, or color or form 
may be the things to bring on a new heaven and 
a new earth, if they are observed and their im- 
plications appreciated. 
Just as the trained experimenter in the natural 
sciences is the only one who is to be relied upon 
to make accurate observations and to appreciate 
their implications, so the trained investigator in 
the field of education is the only one who should 
take any part in the pursuance of truth in his 
field. The importance of this fact is beginning 
to come home to school administrators who have 
experienced the social equivalent of a chemical 
explosion. Persons unskilled in the proper ad- 
ministration and interpretation of tests have set 
out on a campaign of measurement in a school 
68
-P-A-G-E-81
  
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
system, with the result that incensed parents have 
resented the classifications in which their young 
hopefuls found themselves; other things have 
happened frequently because of avoidable errors, 
which have tended, unfortunately, to discredit 
the whole measuring movement in the eyes of the 
people of such communities. Only in rare cases 
is the classroom teacher qualified to administer 
tests, because of the need for uniformity and 
exactness. Only in rare cases is the classroom 
teacher qualified to interpret tests, because of 
the many factors which have to be taken into 
consideration. Even with the most expert hand- 
ling, errors are bound to creep in, though it seems 
a safe assumption that these are far fewer than 
are those made under older systems of classifica- 
tion. Through the increasing literature which is 
now available, and through the rigid training 
which universities are now offering, classroom 
teachers may now become properly fitted both to 
administer and to interpret certain of the stand- 
ard tests, particularly the scales measuring 
school achievement. 
The sine qua non of the experiment, however, 
the thing which distinguishes it from everything 
else, is its isolation and control of the factors in the 
situation. In the experiment of Pasteur already 
69
-P-A-G-E-82
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
quoted,! he allowed every influence that could 
possibly be exerted save one to be brought to bear 
upon the water of one flask — electricity, mag- 
netism, ozone, or any imaginary force. That one 
which he kept away was the dust of the air. All 
the conditions were identical in the case of the 
other flask except that the dust could reach the 
infusion. In the former the bacteria did not 
appear, in the latter they did. He had thus 
isolated the factor of the dust. He controlled 
its entrance by means of the crooked-necked 
flask. He could conclude that the bacteria ap- 
peared in the water not by spontaneous genera- 
tion but by the influence of the dust of the 
air. 
The coin and the feather dropped at a different 
rate to the earth, and it might be concluded that 
this was due to the difference in their weight. 
But there is another factor that can be isolated 
and controlled, and this is the factor of atmo- 
spheric resistance. When the coin and the 
feather are placed inside a glass tube and the air 
removed by means of an exhaust pump, the in- 
fluence of this factor is removed; when the tube 
is reversed, they fall together to the other end. 
It is thus possible to conclude that the original 
1 Page 34. 
79.
-P-A-G-E-83
  INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
difference in their rate of fall was not due to their 
differing weights, but to the greater resistance 
offered the surface of the feather. 
The final characteristic of the experiment is 
that it can be repeated at will. Any person with 
the requisite amount of training and technical 
skill should be able to follow the method exactly 
and arrive at the same results. The experiments 
cited above ‘can be repeated with comparative 
ease; others require far more time and apparatus. 
The reason that some of the experiments quoted 
to support the doctrine of the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics are not taken as sufficient 
evidence in support of this doctrine is the fact 
that other biologists have not succeeded in re- 
peating them. This suggests that some error has 
crept in undetected, some factors in the situation 
have not been isolated and controlled. The 
essential features of the experimental method, 
then, aside from careful observation and quanti- 
tative measurement, are the trained investigator, 
the isolation and control of the factors of the 
situation, and the repetition of the experimenta- 
tion.

Rules of Scientific Thinking 
There are certain rules ! of scientific thinking 
which have gradually been evolved during the 
last thousand years, adherence to which helps to 
guard against error, the sin which doth so easily 
beset the experimenter. These rules of the game 
like certain of the mechanical devices, like the 
experiment itself, are really instruments of pre- 
cision, and must constantly be borne in mind 
not only by the investigator himself, but by those 
who would follow and profit by his investigation. 
This is more rather than less true in the field of 
education where a great many so-called ‘con- 
tributions’ are of dubious value. 
1. Give first place to facts. This is one of the 
oldest of the rules, having been stressed by Roger 
Bacon in the twelfth century. Roger Bacon 
“called the science of his time from authorities to 
things, from opinions to sources, from dialectic to 
experience, from books to nature.” ? He was 
little more than a voice crying in the wilderness 
at the time, but his rule has never been questioned 
by scientific men.

& Co., 1912), p. 42, ff.

pany, 1901), p. 344. 
72  
-P-A-G-E-85
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
Although this was one of the first rules to be 
formulated, it is one which is frequently neglected 
even to-day. The rule compels us to give first 
place to facts, but it is often very hard to give up 
a pet theory even in the face of the facts. We 
are sorely tempted to try to make our facts fit our 
theories, particularly if these theories are our own 
invention or if they are of long standing. It is 
easy to consider a stubborn fact merely as an 
exception to the rule, and be content to keep both 
the rule and the exception. But sooner or later 
one will have to go, and usually it is the rule we 
have made and not the fact we have discovered. 
An exponent of a present-day religious cult is 
reported to have said that facts to her were but 
as grass to be brushed aside and trampled on in 
the attainment of the greater truth. 
In contrast with this is the scientific attitude 
which may be illustrated by a quotation from 
Darwin whose prolific mind suggested innumer- 
able hypotheses which he tested by the host of 
facts which his indefatigable labor collected: “I 
have steadily endeavored to keep my mind free 
so as to give up any hypotheses, however much 
beloved...as soon as facts are shown to be 
opposed to it. Indeed I have had no choice but 
to act in this manner, for, with the exception of 
s 73
-P-A-G-E-86
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a single 
first-formed hypothesis which had not after a 
time to be given up or greatly modified.” * 
The inquisitors of Galileo were all for continu- 
ing allegiance to their theory believing that re- 
ligion would suffer by the defection of any. But 
the stubborn facts had their way, and while the 
Ptolemaic theory for which they so firmly stood 
has gone into the discard, religion seems to be 
about as potent a force as ever. It seems highly 
probable that the facts of biology will be like- 
wise superior to dogma, and incidentally, be 
quite as impotent in the destruction of re- 
ligion. 
Education, having so recently ventured forth 
from the kindly protection of authority, has par- 
ticular need to guard against the infringement of 
this rule. There are so many ideas as to the 
sacredness of things as they are, from ‘the little 
red schoolhouse’ to the 8-4 organization of 
grades, and from the time-tested ‘school sub- 
jects’ to the doctrine of formal discipline, that it 
is too easy for the educator to view the facts 
turned up by surveys, by standardized tests, by 
carefully conducted experiments as merely grass

Appleton & Co., 1887), vol. 1, p. 83. 
74
-P-A-G-E-87
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
to be mown down before the progress of his be- 
guiling theories. 
2. Don’t multiply theories unnecessarily. This, 
again, is a very old rule dating back to the four- 
teenth century. It was formulated by William 
of Occam thus: “Entia non sunt multiplicanda 
praeter necessitatem.” Theoretical existences 
must not be increased without necessity. The 
need for this rule was felt because it was found 
that people were inventing new theories to ac- 
count for new phenomena. Occam wanted to 
cut away a lot of this unnecessary mental con- 
struction and see if a few, established theories 
would not account for many of the new dis- 
coveries. Hence this rule was long called ‘Oc- 
cam’s Razor.’ It is sometimes, also, called the 
‘Law of Parsimony.’ Its operation makes for 
greater simplicity and unity. 
An illustration of this rule can be taken from 
the field of psychology. Various forms of so- 
called mind-reading have been known from the 
earliest times. Many fantastic theories have 
been put forward to account for the phenomenon, 
as for example, the one that the thought is pro- 
jected through space in the form of an invisible 
cloud from the thinker to the reader. As over 
against that, psychology has evolved certain 
75
-P-A-G-E-88
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
very well established doctrines such as that of the 
action of the neurones in receiving stimuli by 
means of the sense organs and responding in 
various ways. With Occam’s razor we can cut 
away the extra theory, and see if the phenomena 
cannot be explained on the basis of the one which 
we already have, and which explains a great many 
other phenomena. Study of cases of mind-read- 
ing then results in the discovery of what is called 
muscle-reading, or the interpretation of very 
small movements of the ‘thinker’ which no one 
notices but the ‘reader.’ Here we have an ex- 
planation on the basis of the other doctrine so 
that in this case it is unnecessary to multiply 
theories. 
3. Avoid the fallacy of the reification of abstrac- 
tions, or considering subjective phenomena as 
objectively existing things, or even as causes. 
In its cruder or more obvious form, this is personi- 
fication, and can be illustrated by the mythology 
of any primitive people. The phenomenon of 
the thunder was observed and explained by the 
hurling of thunder bolts by Zeus who then was 
the Thunderer, or the cause of the thunder, as was 
Thor among the Norse people. The harvest was 
a most important period of the year, and this was 
controlled by Ceres, who one time in her wrath 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
  INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
caused the streams to dry up and the growing 
grain to become parched and to shrivel. The 
harvest and nature’s fertility were personified, 
reified, made a being who was considered the cause. 
In its more subtle forms this fallacy is not so 
easy to detect.!_ Certain learned men not so long 
ago published abroad the statement that they had 
succeeded in weighing the soul because they noted 
a slight decrease in the weight of the body when 
death came. They therefore unblushingly an- 
nounced that they had measured in ounces the 
weight of a metaphysical conception. Descartes’ 
locating of the seat of the soul in the pineal gland 
is more to be pardoned than that. It would be like 
weighing the nebular hypothesis or finding the 
diameter of goodness. Present-day spiritualism 
is likewise falling into the error of reification. 
True, many who investigate the phenomena of 
ectoplasm, and of table-tipping, and yet are not 
convinced that all cases are fraudulent, reject the 
‘spirit hypothesis.’ But even in doing this, they 
are in danger of talking about the objectivation 
of thought, of putting a thought or a mental 
image under the microscope, which is all too like 
locating it in a neurone. When the thought has 
1 Cf. Wallas, Graham: on “ Political Entities” in his Human 
Nature in Politics (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1909). 
77 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
once achieved its ectoplasmic reification it then 
becomes potent, easily enough, and moves fur- 
niture around at will. 
Gravity is another phenomenon which is easily 
reified. Gravity is the name given to the phe- 
nomenon of the attraction that bodies have for 
each other. But when we say that this attrac- 
tion, this falling of the apple to the ground is 
caused by gravity, we are creating a god, and our 
next step should logically be to implore this Grav- 
ity to cause another apple to fall as soon as we 
have finished eating the first! : 
The history of psychology is not free from this 
error. The various abilities and traits from 
memory and reasoning power to docility and 
amativeness were reified, given a particular 
pigeon hole in the brain by the phrenologists, 
and considered as potent entities by the faculty 
psychologists. Though there are no longer any 
faculty psychologists among the psychologists, 
they are still to be found on college faculties. 
Even to-day we hear talk of reasoning power, 
strengthening the memory, will power, and the 
like, as if they were not names for certain groups 
of particular reactions, but were separate, well- 
nigh corporeal beings whose energy TT be 
enlisted in our behalf. 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
  
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
Only the hardy and the foolhardy have the 
temerity to enter the instinct controversy. 
Therefore let this alone be said. There is danger 
of committing the fallacy of reification when an 
instinct is regarded not as a grouping of various 
unlearned reactions, but as a separate force which 
compels the reactions. To say that a child plays 
with blocks because of his instinct for manipula- 
tion is saying no more than that this child plays 
with blocks because he plays with blocks and 
other things like them. The instinct of manipu- 
lation, then, is not an outside force which is re- 
sponsible for the child’s behavior; it is merely a 
name for a particular kind of behavior. To 
assume that it is such a force producing the be- 
havior is to accept but one of several interpreta- 
tions of the behavior. 
4. Regard analogy as a source of suggestion, not 
as proof. A well-constructed analogy forms one 
of the most specious forms of false reasoning to 
trip the unwary that a special pleader for any 
cause has at his disposal. An analogy is a partial 
similarity. To reason from analogy is to infer 
that because two things are known to be alike in 
certain respects they are therefore alike in certain 
other respects. A child learns many lessons thus. 
The nursery kitten scampers on four legs, is 
79
-P-A-G-E-92
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
white and fluffy. Out-of-doors an ugly tempered 
pup appears which answers to the same descrip- 
tion. The child toddles up to him, saying ‘nice 
kitty,’ but the analogy is incomplete; dissimilari- 
ties appear at once. The cur growls, snaps at 
the child and makes off. But the child has not 
learned to distrust analogies. He grows up and 
is about to cast his first vote. The political 
orator dramatically calls attention to the fact 
that he came from the same town as most of the 
members of his audience, and that together they 
should push on to victory. Probably he says 
‘shoulder to shoulder.’ The youth casts his vote 
and helps to elect the candidate, who straightway 
makes a very comfortable income from the extra- 
salary perquisites of his office, leaving his fel- 
low townsmen none thericher. The similarity 
of birthplace is no earnest of a likeness in ideals. 
The analogy was incomplete. 
Another form of this type of error is the case of 
a man who meets a stranger who looks like his 
best friend. Here is a partial similarity — ex- 
ternal appearance. He therefore concludes that 
this stranger has the other qualities of his friend; 
so he walks up to him, makes himself known, and 
engages the man in conversation. At once 
differences appear, and on leaving perhaps the 
80
-P-A-G-E-93
  INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
man discovers that he no longer has his purse. 
The errors of a much advertised system for 
reading character at sight are of this kind, but 
are ona larger and more systematized scale. Cer- 
tain mental and emotional characteristics are 
supposed to go with certain shapes of counte- 
nance or certain coloring or skin texture. It is 
therefore inferred that all persons having these 
shapes of head, this coloring and skin texture, 
have these certain mental and emotional charac- 
teristics. 
Various experiments are easily open to this 
kind of error in their interpretation. For 
example, it is found that white rats learn the four 
sections of a maze in a particular way more 
rapidly than in any other. It is a glaringly false 
analogy to infer that human beings will learn the 
four stanzas of a poem more rapidly in a similar 
way. And yet, though this is not proof, it pre- 
sents a most interesting hypothesis, a valuable 
source of suggestion for further inquiry. 
Another form of this analogy appears when the 
laws and theories from one field of knowledge or 
activity are brought in to explain phenomena 
in another field. We sometimes wonder how 
Froebel, sensible as he was, could have spent so 
much time in speculating on the peculiarities of 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
the various crystals and drawing conclusions 
from their geometric regularities for life and 
morality. In his autobiography appears this 
passage: “The crystal world, in symbolic fashion, 
bore unimpeachable witness to me, through its 
brilliant unvarying shapes, of life and of the laws 
of human life, and spoke to me with silent yet 
true and readable speech of the real life of the 
world of mankind.” 
The arts, with the greatest ease, can talk in 
the language of each other. A warm color, dis- 
cordant shades, colorful harmonies, living marble, 
eloquent bronze, vigorous melody — these and 
even more striking combinations are to be found 
in the literature of any of the arts. But scientific 
thinking must confine its expression to the field 
in which it is working, for otherwise no exactness 
would be possible. For this reason, the rich and 
variegated vocabulary of Freud is immediately 
antipathetical to the scientifically trained man, 
when he talks about such things as impulses in 
the subconscious guarded by a censor. This 
fallacy is sometimes called the ‘fallacy of irrele- 
vant interpretation’ or ‘imported principle,’ and 
becomes dangerous as soon as the symbolic or 
hypothetical character of the terminology is for- 
gotten. 
82

5. Apply the test of agreement to both positive and 
negative cases. No conclusion can be accepted 
unless it is self-consistent, that is, agrees with 
itself, agrees with the facts more completely than 
any other interpretation, and agrees! with the 
known facts and previously discovered laws. It 
is clear that this last criterion might occasionally 
have to be abandoned in case new facts are pre- 
sented which make the older conclusions unten- 
able. In the case of the younger sciences, this 
occasionally if not frequently happens, but here 
as well as in the more well established sciences 
revolutions are not as frequent as young investi- 
gators sometimes think they are going to be. 
The theories and laws are extended a little here 
and modified a little there, but as a whole they 
remain about the same. Only on the fringes of 
the sciences, in the realm of the hypotheses is 
there frequent give and take. 
6. Scrutinize all statements purporting to be true. 
This rule Descartes regarded very carefully. “I 
have taken pains,” he says, “never to accept 
anything for true that I did not clearly know to 
be such .. . and to comprise nothing more in my 
judgment than what was presented to my mind 
so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground 
1Cf£. p. 48. 
83
-P-A-G-E-96
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
for doubt.” In this way, Descartes guarded him- 
self against building upon common sayings, au- 
thoritative formulations of Church or State, or 
mere opinions as if they were true, until he had 
scrutinized them carefully so as to pass on their 
truth or untruth himself. If teachers and edu- 
cators could apply this rule regularly, the educa- 
tional hobbyist might have to retire or find some 
other employment. Many statements pass for 
true because they were uttered by some famous 
authority or are written in some ponderous book, 
statements which may have been true, possibly, 
when they were uttered or written, but which will 
bear scrutiny before they are indiscriminately 
applied to-day. For many people, to see a thing 
in print is to believe it. This gullibility of the 
public for the printed page presents a real 
obstacle in the path of the clear thinking that is 
needed in a democracy. Signs of a better time 
are appearing, however, not only because this 
tule of Descartes in the guise of critical reading is 
being more and more employed in the schools, 
but also because the newspapers have taken ad- 
vantage of their power to such a degree that they 
are coming to be more and more distrusted. 
All assumptions fall under this rule. Geome- 
try, for example, assumes the truth of certain 
84
-P-A-G-E-97
  
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
mental constructions which it cannot prove, viz., 
the axioms and the postulates. But these are not 
passed by hurriedly; they are viewed carefully 
from every possible angle. It were well if all 
assumptions in scientific investigation were given 
as thorough an airing. Even though some of 
them cannot be completely demonstrated, even 
though there is doubt about some others, the 
extent of the uncertainty is recognized, the 
weakness of each link in the chain is ascertained, 
so if any break comes, it is possible to locate the 
point fairly accurately and. give it particular 
consideration. 
Aside from the primary postulates of physical 
science? there are less general assumptions 
against which the worker must constantly 
be on his guard. One of these, in the field of ed- 
ucational research is the theoretical probability 
curve. It is rather terrifying, sometimes, to 
consider the number of statistical calculations 
which assume the normal frequency curve. An- 
other source of error in this field is the unwar- 
ranted assumption of a random sampling; there 
may be some selective factor at work, such for 
1 For example, the uniformity of nature, the rationality of the 
universe, the objective reality of the physical world, and the 
actuality of space and time. 
85  
-P-A-G-E-98
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
instance, as the elimination of the less gifted in 
the upper grades and high schoal which makes 
measures of high school students far from ap- 
plicable to youth at large. Another illustration 
of a dubious assumption is found in the basis of 
scoring the true-false examinations. The guesses 
of a large number of pupils would be about half 
right and half wrong; but there is no assurance 
that the guesses of each pupil will be half right 
and half wrong. 
7. Avoid basing conclusions on too few cases. 
Induction proceeds, as we have seen, from the 
particular cases to the general statement of uni- 
formity concerning them. Though authorities 
differ on the point, it is not usually considered 
induction when all the cases possible can be ob- 
served. To be induction there must be what is 
known as the inductive leap. Because an hy- 
pothesis holds true in all of the hundreds of cases 
studied, we ‘jump to the conclusion’ that it will 
hold true in every case. In the simple illustration 
used previously, we study hundreds of leaves, and 
every one is green. Inductively, we lean to the 
conclusion that all leaves are green. The danger 
in the inductive leap is readily seen. For a little 
later we may come upon the yellow one and the 
red one. 
86
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
The great care that the investigators in the 
natural sciences have shown in carefully avoiding 
this source of error by the most painstaking ob- 
servation can well be emulated by workers in the 
- newer fields of the social sciences. 
But a still more vigorous warning needs to be 
given. If every one based his conclusions on a 
number of cases, the results would be more satis- 
factory than they now are, when people are so 
prone to make all inclusive generalizations on the 
basis of just one case! The young man is disap- 
pointed in love; so all women are fickle. It rains 
the day of the picnic; so it always rains on a day 
when a picnic is planned. The Chinese laundry- 
man lost some collars for a customer, so he never 
can trust a Chinaman. i bee ee 
Reasoning like this is so common in daily con- 
versation that it is quite unnecessary to multiply 
illustrations. Aside from committing the griev- 
ous error of generalizing from too few cases, the 
additional error is made of neglecting the negative 
cases. The person does not record the number 
of faithful women of his acquaintance, the num- 
ber of days it did not rain for the picnic, the 
number of Chinamen whose treatment of him 
has been beyond reproach. 
The following anecdote illustrates this fallacy 
87
-P-A-G-E-100
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
of neglecting the negative cases in a rather un- 
usual way. A young man was demonstrating the 
strength of a premonition. He told of how he 
was traveling in a trolley in a certain city, when 
ahead of him a building that was under construc- 
tion seemed to sway toward the road where his 
car was about to pass. In his mind’s eye he 
could see the building totter and crash down upon 
the car, crushing the passengers who were thus 
confined and helpless. He could hear their 
agonizing screams. So sure was he of what was 
about to happen that he started to his feet to get 
off the car before it was too late, but he seemed 
unable to move. The car came nearer to the 
building. It was directly in front of it. The 
man cringed. The car moved on smoothly 
toward its destination. The building had not 
fallen. A rather disappointing conclusion, per- 
haps. Exactly. That is the kind of story that 
doesn’t usually get told. That is the negative 
case that is usually neglected. If the building 
had fallen, if there had been a seemingly miracu- 
lous escape, the narrator might easily have been 
convinced of the potency of a premonition, and 
that story would have been his favorite to bring 
out when tales of the mysterious and the occult 
were being told.

8. Be consistent and coherent; that is, reason 
correctly avoiding deductive fallacies. These are 
enumerated and illustrated in any standard work 
on logic with their Latin and English names. 
Only one other will be mentioned. This is the 
kind of non sequitur called post hoc ergo propter 
hoc — ‘after this, therefore on account of it.’ 
This is mentioned because it is so frequently met 
with, and because it is so insidious in its opera- 
tion. A great city sets out on a campaign to im- 
prove its schools. The taxpayers are deluged 
with publicity, a big building program is in- 
augurated, junior high schools are built, and 
other reforms are put through. The board of 
education then announces that a large per cent 
more children are retained in the junior high 
school than the other organization was able to 
hold. Surely this increase in school population 
came after the junior high school program had 
been put into effect, but the cause of the increase 
might also be found in the greater interest of the 
people in the schools, in the added vigilance of 
the truant officer, the appeal of new buildings, 
and many other factors. A mother in another 
city whose son was attending the junior high 
school for the first time, complained that he was 
ruder than he used to be, and that he didn’t play 
89 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
at home so much, preferring to go off ‘goodness 
knows where’ with a lot of boys she didn’t know. 
She complained to the principal of the effect the 
school was having on her boy. It is hardly 
necessary to suggest that this change in the be- 
havior of her son, though it came after his pro- 
motion to the junior high school, would probably 
have come just the same if he had gone on into 
the usual seventh grade. The changes which 
she deplored came after his transference to the 
other school but not on account of it. 
9. Use precise terms. Scientists have always 
endeavored to express themselves exactly so as 
to avoid all misunderstanding and ambiguity. 
One source of inexactness lies in the use of meta- 
phorical language. Excellent and necessary as 
this is in literary expression, that a passage may 
be interpreted in terms of the reader’s emotional 
experience, it is a stumbling block to clarity when 
the intellectual processes alone are enlisted. The 
true scientist is, therefore, repelled when he sees 
such a passage as the following, taken from a re- 
cent advertisement : Some people “ try to make the 
grade of success with the WitL-PoweEr cylinder 
not firing at all — or with a sooty spark-plug in 
the Purpose cylinder.” It is pardonable because 
of its ‘appeal’ value, perhaps, but as an explana- 
go
-P-A-G-E-103
' INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
tion of the thought processes it is impossible. 
Many volumes on a variety of subjects ranging 
all the way from will-power to Freudianism and 
from auto-suggestion to various Oriental cults, 
‘and classed by the book-sellers as psychology, 
have recently been published which seek to 
appeal to the popular mind by means of such 
flaring figures. The following is a fairly mild 
illustration, taken from a recent treatise on auto- 
suggestion: “ He who can control his own mind by 
an iron will, and say to the Thoughts which he 
would banish, ‘Be ye my slaves and begone into 
outer darkness,’ or to Peace ‘Dwell with me for- 
ever, come what may,’ and be obeyed, that man 
is a mighty magician who has attained what is 
worth more than all the earth possesses.” 
To gain greater precision, a technical termi- 
nology has grown up in the different branches of 
science. This is sometimes the despair of the 
layman when his progress is blocked by such 
terms as ‘hyper-brachycephalic’ man or ‘bath- 
mic’ evolution. He cries out in despair for a 
book that is written in English. No wonder that 
a great deal of popularized science has appeared 
which has been of uneven worth. But just such 
technical terms, as substitutes for round-about 
expressions, and as symbols for ideas previously 
gl
-P-A-G-E-104
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
unnamed, have made possible the rapid progress 
of science during the last few decades. We can- 
not imagine physics or chemistry without its 
complicated formule. We can but rejoice in 
a similar movement in education. It is an indica- 
tion of a possible acceleration in the rate at which 
problems now pressing in this field will find their 
solution. 
Exact definition is a necessary corollary to 
a technical terminology. Although definitions 
seem a dreary waste to the beginner in any 
science, and various pedagogical methods are 
employed to soften their harshness, no one would 
deny their necessity. Science has no time for the 
argument which ends: “Oh, if that is what you 
meant, all right. I agree with you.” 
Both psychology and education are handi- 
capped by being forced to use a great many tech- 
nical terms which are also used in common 
speech. For example, the word ‘soul’ has 
largely been dropped from psychological dis- 
cussion chiefly because it is practically impossible 
to find two persons who agree as to the meaning 
of the term. Other words which tend to am- 
biguity in this respect are idea, instinct, mind, 
will, evolution, brightness, character, personality. 
In the eleventh century there was a similar 
92
-P-A-G-E-105
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
looseness in the use of such words as mathe- 
matics, astronomy, astrology, and magic, which 
were used interchangeably by some authors. 
Progress in the direction of exact and uniform 
terminology is necessarily slow. It is, therefore, 
a source of gratification when terms with which 
the educator deals begin to assume a definite and 
uniform meaning. ‘The increasing exactness in 
the definition of such terms as curriculum, junior 
high school, acceleration, retardation, and moron 
are glimmerings which presage the dawn of a 
new day. 
A fourth means for greater precision is to be 
found in the use of quantitative measures. These 
are discussed elsewhere 1 but are mentioned here 
because they are quite as important as the avoid- 
ance of figurative language and the use of a tech- 
nical terminology and of careful definition, if 
slipshod thinking and fruitless speculation are to 
be replaced by the dependable conclusions which 
science seeks. 
Scientific Knowledge and Other Knowledge 
From what has been said, it is clear that the 
difference between scientific knowledge and 
other knowledge is one of degree and not one of 
1 Page 64. © 
93
-P-A-G-E-106
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
kind. But the difference is a wide one, neverthe- 
less. 
Scientific knowledge, in the first place is free 
from personal bias, whether that bias be due to 
the weight of authority, the pride in one’s own 
opinion, or the consequences to oneself. The 
scientist is not a special pleader for his cause, 
except as he pleads that the facts which he pre- 
sents and the conclusions which are based upon 
them be given their due consideration. 
Scientific knowledge, in the second place, is 
exact. With its instruments of precision, its 
quantitative measurement, its employment of 
experiment and its careful precautions against 
error, all handled by trained experts, it presents 
its data with a care for detail that is lacking and 
even unnecessary in many other fields. 
Scientific knowledge, in the third place, is 
verifiable. Its experiments can be repeated and 
its statements scrutinized critically by any one 
with adequate training. Its facts are not of the 
past like historical events, but are principles 
operating uniformly at all times. 
Scientific knowledge, in the fourth place, is 
systematized. A science has no place for hetero- 
geneous, unrelated facts and theories no matter 
how well they may be established. Everything 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
  
INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION 
must be understood in its proper relationship to 
everything else, whether that be a relationship of 
cause and effect, of similarity, or whatsoever it 
may be. And these various items must hold to- 
gether in their different classifications into an 
organic, systematic whole. 
We are now in a position to examine more care- 
fully the recent changes in education, and to 
inquire if they are scientific, to what extent educa- 
tion employs the scientific method, and to ask if 
education itself may be regarded as a science.

SCIENTIFIC METHODS APPLIED TO 
EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
IF one casts about for evidence that the influence 
‘of custom, authority, and opinion in education is 
on the wane, he has not far to look. On every 
hand are the signs pointing in that direction. 
It is significant that the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science recently made 
room among the affiliated sciences for an educa- 
tion section, SectionQ. This is, however, merely 
a recognition of the increased output of studies 
of a scientific nature in the educational field. 
A still more palpable indication of this activity 
is to be found in the multiplication of publications 
carrying quantitative and experimental studies 
in the field of education. The National Bureau 
of Education and such foundations as the 
Russell Sage, the Carnegie, and the General 
Education Board, as well as various experimental 
schools, seem to vie with each other in turning 
out studies of one sort or another, of uneven 
value, to be sure, but yet far away from the pro- 
nouncements of custom, authority, and opinion. 
Nearly a score of journals, monograph series, 
96
-P-A-G-E-109
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
and yearbooks ! regularly publish studies of im- 
portance which involve the use of the funda- 
mental characteristics of the scientific method. 
Besides these there is an ever-increasing number 
of books which present information derived from 
research in the fields of tests and scales, edu- 
cational psychology, curriculum-making, and 
school administration. At the very least, these 
things bear witness to a truly amazing develop- 
ment of interest and activity in the direction of 
educational inquiry free from the fetters of the 
past and hard in pursuit of new truth. 
Methods of Psychology — Used to Study Children 
The genealogy of the college of education is 
easily traceable to the department of philosophy 
in the European and early American universities. 
The professor of philosophy was expected to give 
some lectures on psychology and some on peda-

cago), Educational Psychology Monographs, Harvard Bulletins

gogy. Then psychology and education grew to 
such size that they split off from the parent stem 
and became a separate department. So rapid, 
however, was the development of subject-matter, 
like that of the various natural sciences which 
were formerly grouped as one course called 
natural philosophy, that in many centers psy- 
chology and education became separate depart- 
ments, the latter in many cases growing into a 
separate college in the group of colleges in the 
university. 
The period of union of psychology and educa- 
tion, a period which continues even to-day in 
many of the smaller colleges of this country, was 
far from being detrimental to the best interests 
of education. On the contrary, the two fields 
have the whole learning process in common, and 
it is natural, therefore, that many of the earlier 
scientific studies of this essential portion of the 
work should have been made by psychologists. 
“We do not understand children!” exclaimed 
Rousseau. It is to make good this deficiency 
which he so deplored that the psychologists have 
come forward in increasing numbers, endeavoring 
to free themselves from the habits of thought de- 
creed by custom and by authority; endeavoring 
to escape from the influence of easy generaliza- 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
tions and of proverbs quoted for generations, 
which are about as effective as the Anglo-Saxon 
charm for bewitched land; and endeavoring 
to get disentangled from empirical knowledge, 
which is about as unsatisfactory as the methods 
of fertilization of the soil of the American Indian. 
At one time, not so very long ago, children were 
considered as miniature adults, in all things like 
them except for size. The early Renaissance 
artists painted children with heads bearing the 
same proportion to their bodies that the head of 
the adult bears to his body. Long after this it 
came to be discovered that children are differently 
proportioned beings in every way — physically, 
mentally, emotionally. It was, therefore, a 
great victory when educators began talking about 
‘the child’ in contradistinction to ‘the adult.’ 
Only recently has there been reflected in the 
language usually employed the realization that 
children differ amongst themselves nearly as 
much as they differ from adult human beings; 
that while generalizations about ‘the child’ are 
often of value, nevertheless they lead to griev- 
ous misunderstandings. And while people have 
always known that children ‘are just as different 
as they can be,’ they have not known exactly 
in what ways they are different and to what ex- 
99 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
tent. One generalization was as good as another, 
and one generation was little ahead of the pre- 
ceding. It is, therefore, with the intention of 
emphasizing this realization of individual dif- 
ferences scientifically studied that this section is 
entitled not “Methods of Psychology — Used to 
Study the Child,” but “Methods of Psychology 
— Used to Study Children.” 
1. The questionnaire. One difference between 
the astronomer and the psychologist is that no 
one has any grounds for questioning what the 
astronomer says about the stars, but everybody 
thinks he knows more about children than the 
psychologist. It was to capitalize this informa- 
tion on a grand scale that the questionnaire came 
into use in psychology, having been borrowed 
from those who used it to compile figures and 
make reports concerning the census, immigra- 
tion, and labor. 
This method was employed to the full by the 
late G. Stanley Hall of Clark University in 
the compilation, among other things, of his 
two monumental volumes on adolescence. The 
method was to circularize various people and ask 
them certain questions concerning their previous 
ways of thinking, their interests, enjoyments, 
and when these began, their motives, and the 
100
-P-A-G-E-113
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
like. School teachers in particular, being a fairly 
unified group and interested in these questions, 
were a very fruitful source of information. Per- 
haps in this era of the reaction against the indis- 
criminate use of the questionnaire, we are too apt 
to minimize its importance. It at least presents 
a fairly accurate record of the beliefs and recol- 
lections of the person who fills it out conscien- 
tiously even though these may not always be 
accurate representations of what transpired years 
before. But more particularly, it serves to focus 
attention upon certain problems and certain 
aspects of those problems, and certainly in the 
case of Hall’s Adolescence, a wider interest in the 
problems of this period has been created than 
could be imagined without it, and his conclusions 
have acted as a real stimulus to further investiga- 
tion. 
But there are certain disadvantages that far 
outweigh the advantages. In the first place, his 
dicta have until recently been too much taken 
for granted; they have not stimulated enough 
investigation. Secondly, usually a third to a half 
of the persons circularized do not answer the 
questionnaire. It is assuming too much when 
it is supposed that these persons’ answers would 
correspond in every way to the answers of those 
IOI 
 
-P-A-G-E-114

SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
who did respond. Furthermore, the group cir- 
cularized is all too apt to be a special group, not 
a random selection, so that we a in danger of 
falling into error when we make our inductive 
leap and conclude that all people are like that. 
There is considerable reason to suppose that the 
youth of school teachers is not a fe basis from 
which to generalize concerning the youth of busi- 
ness men, mechanics, shopgirls, bootleggers, and 
clergymen. Thirdly, the report is biased, not 
only because the questioner is apt to select the 
reports that fit his theories, but also because 
there is a tendency on the part of a person filling 
out a questionnaire to give the questioner what 
he is looking for. This may be purposely done, 
or it may be quite unconscious on the part of the 
writer. He may and quite probably will rational- 
ize his acts, and report motives by which he may 
think he was guided rather than those which 
actually decided his conduct. And lastly, in- 
cidental memory is too fickle a thing to trust 
in scientific matters. Experiments inquiring 
into the reliability of testimony have all but 
discredited the eye-witness. mite when we are 
asked to recall at what age we first enjoyed 
music, for instance, our memory is apt to play 
us false. A particular concert may stand out 
102 
   
-P-A-G-E-115
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
in our memory for purely incidental reasons: 
we may have worn a new hat, or perhaps the 
governor sat in a box — and previous concerts 
are quite forgotten. And which one of us re- 
members that sweet music which lulled us to 
happy rest in our earliest years, the mother’s 
cradle song? No, our memories are not to be 
trusted. And though we may report a lot of 
things on our questionnaire which make very in- 
teresting reading when they are compiled, there 
is no one to say which are true and which are false, 
and a real science can put no confidence in them. 
Anthropometry. Alongside of the activity of 
sending out, filling in and recording question- 
naires another and more promising kind of 
measurement was developing. This came from 
the activities of the physiologists and more par- 
ticularly the medical men and those concerned 
with public health. Height, weight, chest-depth, 
chest-expansion, arm-flexion, head-girth, — these 
and many other measurements have been made 
for some time, often by the directors of ‘college 
gymnasiums in order that corrective exercises 
could be prescribed, and better physical con- 
ditions built up. 
These measurements have one important con- 
nection with education in that consecutive 
103
-P-A-G-E-116
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
measures of the same individuals give us our 
exact information concerning physiological 
growth. With these exact measures it is pos- 
sible to make studies of the relation of the 
physical development of children to such things 
as their chronological age and mental develop- 
ment. These measures have been still more 
refined so that with the use of the X-ray the 
process of ossification of the wrist bones is exactly 
determined, a measure which has been found 
useful as an index of anatomical growth. Other 
relationships have been studied as, for example, 
the ratio of height to weight to detect malnu- 
trition and so guard against its consequences. 
Others, on the other hand, are of little or no 
value. Various cranial measures have been 
demonstrated to show no particular relationship 
to mentality except in such instances of feeble- 
mindedness as micro- and  macrocephalis. 
Similar relationships between height and in- 
telligence have been sought, but no credence is 
placed in them except by those who follow after 
the charlatans. 
3- Measuring human reactions. A much more 
profitable technique, however, is the measure- 
ment of human reactions. On the more defi- 
nitely physiological side, such as the activities 
104
-P-A-G-E-117
APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
of the smooth muscles and glands, much more 
remains to be done; the studies! of these re- 
sponses and their relation to the emotions are pi- 
oneer efforts of great promise. On the psycho- 
logical side, the development of measurements 
of the time and accuracy of human responses 
has furnished the main highway down which the 
greatest psychological advances have come, and 
along which the greatest discoveries of the future 
will probably be found. 
Careful measurements of the reaction time of 
such simple responses as depressing a key when a 
light is flashed give way gradually to measuring 
such things as tapping-rate, speed of cancella- 
tion, and memory span for digits. 
When this measuring movement was joined by 
another, great progress was possible. This other 
was the development of the so-called tests of 
intelligence. Although Ebbinghaus was probably 
the first person to employ a creditable test for 
intelligence, a variation of the completion test 
as we now know it, it was Alfred Binet who de- 
vised the complicated instrument which now 
bears his name, and which was adapted to chil- 
dren of different ages. Various revisions were 
1 For example, Cannon, W. B.: Bodily Changes in Pain, 
Hunger, Fear and Rage (D. Appleton & Co., 1915.) 
105
-P-A-G-E-118
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
made of the Binet-Simon scale, the last one 
being completed at about the time of his death 
in 1911. Psychologists in other countries have 
since revised the scale, translating it and adapt- 
ing it to the needs of the particular countries 
concerned, notably Stern in Germany and Cyril 
Burt in England. In this country the revision 
of Terman, called the ‘Stanford Revision,’ has 
had the widest use of any individual measure of 
intelligence, and the adaptation of certain of its 
tasks by Otis so that an intelligence examination 
could be given to a group paved the way for the 
development of the Army Tests in 1918. 
It is naturally not my purpose here to trace the 
development of the testing movement, but only 
to point out that these measures and many others 
now available have been worked out with the 
strictest regard for the care and accuracy that 
science demands, and furnish surprisingly reli- 
able measures of the native ability of children 
of approximately the same culture as those for 
whom the particular scales were devised and 
tested. 
So fruitful has the investigation been in con- 
nection with such tests as these that an hypoth- 
esis which is well called a theory now has been 
evolved — the theory of the constancy of the 
106
-P-A-G-E-119
APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
ratio between the mental age of any particular 
child and his chronological age. On the basis 
of this theory, therefore, it is possible from the 
intelligence quotient, as this ratio is called, to 
predict with considerable accuracy in regard to 
the future school and life success of that child. 
Asa theory it has yet to be tested out thoroughly, 
and like others, it is subject to revision. At the 
very least, it is a very useful measure which can 
serve as a basis for further studies for the proper 
educational guidance of a child. 
There has been considerable hue and cry 
raised of late about the undemocratic character 
of such a measure which, its opponents claim, 
brands some children as stupid and condemns 
them to a life of inferior achievement. Of course, 
this is about as true as saying that the yard- 
stick brands the five-foot man as shorter than 
the majority of his fellow beings. The intelli- 
gence tests do not make or unmake brains any 
more than the yardstick makes height, or the 
scales weight. It simply measures what is there. 
And it is not the first instrument to be so used. 
School marks have long been similarly employed 
without exciting any such solicitude, and those 
who are concerned about the social prestige of 
one who has a low intelligence quotient never 
107
-P-A-G-E-120
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
worried much about the habits of failure which 
the school inculcated in keeping him at tasks too 
difficult for him, and punishing him because he 
couldn’t do them, by all sorts of ingenious tor- 
ments like the red-ink mark of failure, being kept 
after school during a ball game, or kept off the 
team because his work was not up to the stand- 
ard. They were not concerned about the aver- 
sion that grew within him for things of the mind, 
an aversion which grew into hatred because each 
year he was pushed into tasks which he could not 
do, and surpassed by children younger than he. 
Paralleling the intelligence tests in their his- 
torical development during the last decade is the 
formulation of standardized measures of school 
abilities. Stone, Ayres, Courtis, and Thorndike, 
were the pioneers in this work, and their carefully 
developed scales to measure the extent of chil- 
dren’s ability in handwriting, spelling, arithmetic, 
silent reading, composition, etc., have been sup- 
plemented by the work of Woody, Gray, Haggerty, 
Van Wagenen, Otis, Gregory, and many others. 
Here, again, we have nothing new but the 
accuracy and freedom from personal bias, and 
standardization so that a score in an elementary- 
school subject in one school can be compared 
with the score in another. There have always 
108
-P-A-G-E-121
  
APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
been teachers’ marks, but they have not been 
useful for comparison in different schools be- 
cause different teachers had different subjective 
standards of excellence. Ninety per cent for one 
teacher might be the equivalent of seventy per 
cent of another; and even the passing grade in 
such supposedly exact studies as mathematics is 
a movable feast. The teacher’s mark is about 
as useful for purposes of comparison as ‘a few’ 
would be as a unit of measure in place of a dozen. 
So complete is the literature on the subject 
of scales and measures of school ability that there 
is need here but to call attention to the gradual 
perfection of these instruments in the movement 
toward the precision of measurement which a 
science demands and without which there is little 
gain. They are a development in the educa- 
tional field of the method of measurement in 
psychology which places an individual in a cer- 
tain controlled situation and then measures his 
response in terms of time or of accuracy. 
4. The rating scale. Still another method 
which is employed by the psychologists and which 
has been used of late by educators is the rating 
method. It is used to get the benefit of more 
than one person’s judgment about such abilities 
and traits as do not lend themselves easily to 
109
-P-A-G-E-122
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
measurement by the more standardized measures 
discussed above. The rating scale as it was em- 
ployed for the selection of officers in the Army 
was too complicated a method in view of the re- 
sults to have the wide acceptance it at first pro- 
mised. Other schemes of rating character-traits 
have been devised, particularly as they may be 
used in the selection of teachers.!. They mark a 
step in the direction of accuracy above the biased 
judgment of one individual in evaluating the 
traits and abilities of a particular person for a 
particular job. But clearly this method falls far 
short of the accuracy demanded by a scientific 
investigation bent on discovering the facts about 
such an elusive thing as personality. 
5. Experiment. Realizing this, a few experi- 
menters? have endeavored to attack these pro- 
blems in a more scientific fashion. It is proba- 
ble that the near future will see remarkable devel- 
opments in this direction. In addition to such

pioneer work, and in addition to the quantitative 
studies in education using methods evolved by 
the psychologists, certain other investigations 
have been conducted of a rigidly experimental 
nature. James’s classic study of the transfer of 
training in memorizing is historically one of the 
first if not the first actual experimentation of a 
laboratory character in this country. The later 
experiments of Woodworth and Thorndike in the 
beginning years of the century attracted wide 
attention and have been followed by countless 
experiments in the same field. These will have 
to be followed by many more before the trou- 
blous point of the extent and manner of transfer 
is decided to the satisfaction of all. 
As sad a quantity of useless academic talk is 
expended on this topic as upon any in the whole 
field of education. The direction it usually takes 
is that some one in tones of awe explains how 
much he profited by a certain course of study, 
often the classical course. Avoiding the cynic’s 
reaction that he might have been a bigger and 
better man if he had not taken it, it is easy to see 
that a person is no judge of the value to him of a 
particular kind of work. It would, indeed, be 
unfortunate if the rigid linguistic training inci- 
dent to eight years of intelligent study of the

Latin language was not reflected in increased 
facility in the use of the mother tongue. But 
how much that facility is increased, say, in com- 
parison with the way it might possibly have been 
by some other training for eight years; or what 
part the teacher and the native intelligence of 
the student played in this benefit, are questions 
which opinion can never answer. And to argue 
that because eight years of Latin are appreciated 
by a brilliant mind, a dull child shall take one 
year of it to get some benefit, is of course the 
most patent and glaring of familiar fallacies. 
The current theories of transfer, that of trans- 
fer through identical elements (Thorndike), and 
that of transfer by generalization (Judd), do not 
seem so antagonistic as some would have us be- 
lieve. For the present, educators must be con- 
tent with them and the results of experiments to 
date,' and wait patiently for what the future will 
bring forth. The method of science is not rapid; 
it takes longer to formulate a scientific law than 
it does an opinion. But we have seen that for a 
number of reasons the results are more trust- 
worthy. 
1 These experiments, as well as the theories of Thorndike 
and Judd are admirably summarized in Starch: Educational 
Psychology (The Macmillan Company, 1921), pp. 191-255.

Another group of carefully controlled experi- 
ments relates to the progress of learning. The 
pioneer work in this field was done by Ebbing- 
haus, whose invention of nonsense syllables to 
control the factors of previous knowledge and 
chance association on the part of the subjects 
resulted in the Curve of Learning, which is 
really a scientific law in graphic form. The early 
rapid rise, the daily variations, the plateau, the 
physiological limit, — these characteristics have 
been found by other experimenters as the experi- 
ments have been repeated with other materials 
by Book, Bryan and Harter, Swift, Starch, and 
others. This work is rather at a standstill just 
at present, waiting for the more rapid and more 
enthralling development of the tests and meas- 
ures and scales spoken of above. But this work 
on learning will be picked up again, and will 
profit by the development of measures of other 
kinds of learning which, it may be found, may 
not correspond to the more strictly mechanical 
memorizing and acquisition of motor skills which 
fall along the present familiar learning curve. 
To Ebbinghaus, likewise, is due the device for 
measuring the amount and extent of forgetting, 
a most baffling thing to measure, by the simple 
expedient of measuring the time taken to relearn 
113
-P-A-G-E-126
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
a passage and dividing it by the time taken to 
learn it in the first place. This has given us our 
law of forgetting as shown by its characteristic 
curve, its initial rapid fall followed by a gradual 
fall and at last by a long nearly horizontal line 
indicating a period of almost indefinite retention 
of a small portion of what had been learned. It 
has given us our knowledge in regard to over- 
learning with its important corollaries in edu- 
cation. 
Other directions of experimental inquiry of 
the psychologists which are closely related to 
educational problems are the study of eye- 
movements, which has its direct bearing upon 
the teaching of reading, and the study of the 
effects of fatigue which has important school- 
room implications. These problems lend them- 
selves to the careful, experimental investigation 
described earlier, permitting of the elimination 
and control of the factors concerned and the 
repetition of the experimentation. 
Methods of Medicine — Used to Study 
Children and Homes 
1. The clinic. The health of school children 
is beginning to receive the attention which is its 
due, so that in most of the larger schools proper 
114 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
medical attention can be given to the pupils in a 
systematic way, and those whose handicaps are 
less noticeable may have the care they deserve 
as well as those with more severe defects. Ex- 
aminations of eyesight, hearing, teeth and ton- 
sils are usually a part of the routine required by 
law. In most cities the best that medical science 
can give is available not only for the rich, but for 
the poor as well. As Terman! says, “Too often 
tuberculosis steals the child, or spinal curvature 
deforms him while we wrangle over rival methods 
of teaching him geography or grammar or spell- 
ing.” 
2. The case history. When a wounded man 
came back to this country and was taken into 
one of the army hospitals, there usually came 
with him a record of the previous medical atten- 
tion he had received, the various tests made and 
their results, the record of operations and findings 
and opinions of the different physicians who had 
had him in charge. Naturally, these things were 
of great value to those who had to diagnose his 
case and prescribe treatment in the American 
hospitals. 
A similar thing is proving very successful in 
1 Terman, L. M.: The Hygiene of the School Child (Houghton 
Mifflin Company, 1914), p. 15. 
115  
-P-A-G-E-128
  
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
the schools. These records may or may not be of 
a medical nature; the similarity is in the method, 
not in their content. In many of the more ad- 
vanced school systems, research bureaus are 
established as a part of the public school system. 
In the files of these bureaus are to be found, in 
some cases the records of every child in the sys- 
tem, in others the record of each whose case is 
in any way unusual so as to need special atten- 
tion because of failures of one sort or another, 
because of disciplinary troubles, and the like. 
These records are not important because they 
contain the teachers’ marks for these children, 
though they may contain these. They are im- 
portant because they contain the results of the 
standardized tests which have been administered 
to the pupils — the intelligence quotient, the 
percentile standing in other intelligence tests and 
in educational tests, and in many cases the test 
paper itself. If trouble is reported for any par- 
ticular child, here is his record, and his case can 
be dealt with intelligently on the basis of it. 
But these case histories are important for another 
reason. 
On each one of the medical case study blanks 
is a place for a disease history of the family. The 
physicians may be content with the patient’s 
116
-P-A-G-E-129
  
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
account of this. But the social workers, like the 
educators, have borrowed the method of the case 
history. One of the things which they do is to 
investigate the home conditions of any delin- 
quent whose case they wish to handle intelli- 
gently. In this study, the work of the physician, 
the social worker and the psychologist as a stu- 
dent of mental hygiene come close together. 
A child seems listless in school, lacks interest 
in his work, fails repeatedly. A study is made of 
the case. It is found that his mother is dead, his 
father is a teamster who takes the boy to a wagon 
restaurant for a breakfast of two cups of coffee and 
a doughnut at five o’clock each morning, after 
which the boy carries papers until schooltime. 
A girl is caught in petty thefts of money. In- 
vestigation shows that she is allowed no spending 
money by her parents, though they have enough 
to allow her some. She wants to be like her 
mates and treat them once in a while if she has 
to steal from them to pay for the treat! Another 
who plays truant, it is discovered, feels uncom- 
fortable in school because she hasn’t as good 
clothes as the other girls have. A boy fails to 
pass, his parents scold him unmercifully and whip 
him. He wonders what’s the use, and likewise 
runs away from school. Various unsatisfactory 
117  
-P-A-G-E-130
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
compensatory reactions are often due to just 
such conditions in which the child is humiliated 
in some way. ‘Then, too, nervous, irritable 
children, it is often found, come from homes 
where they are nagged by their parents, or fright- 
ened, or punished by one of the parents and se- 
cretly rewarded by the other. The conditions 
producing the symptomatic behavior with which 
the school must deal are often not easily discov- 
ered, and when discovered correction is frequently 
difficult partly because of the stubborn nature 
of such disabilities and partly because the unfor- 
tunate home conditions are not under control of 
school authorities. 
Clearly, the good old rough-and-ready way 
of making children work and whipping them if 
they don’t is as archaic as it is brutal; and in all 
fairness an effort toward an intelligent handling 
of these cases as the knowledge about them is 
gradually collected is the very least that can be 
expected of schools in this particular. 
A Method of Sociology — Used to Study 
Curriculum Content 
The social survey. In former times it was prac- 
tically possible for one pupil to master all that 
the school could teach, and at some periods of 
118 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
    
APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
history it was almost within reason for one man 
to know all that was known. But the former 
things have passed away. To-day we see the 
curricula of the schools crowded with great 
quantities of subject-matter jostling each other, 
each demanding a place of precedence. The 
happy days when the lower schools taught the 
three R’s and the higher schools and colleges 
Greek, Latin, and Mathematics are no more. 
Perhaps philosophy is responsible for the change 
— the camel’s head protruding into the tent of 
the contented Arab was soon followed by such 
other portions of the ungainly animal that the 
Arab found himself out in the cold. Natural 
philosophy was followed by the many separate 
departments which gradually appeared owing 
to the enormous increase of knowledge brought 
about by scientific investigation. Only a few 
years before the Civil War an instructor at Yale 
devoted two or three lectures to the principles 
of electricity assuring his students that this 
knowledge would in all probability be sufficient 
for them to understand any developments along 
that line that might take place during their 
lifetime! Then moral philosophy likewise took 
to dividing like a cell, and ethics, psychology, 
education and other departments appeared. 
119
-P-A-G-E-132
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
Long before this, the older subjects had to 
justify themselves or be shoved out into the cold. 
The argument concerning their cultural value 
had to be supplemented by the disciplinary 
argument, and thus a foothold was maintained. 
Then the sciences with their practical know- 
ledge and close connection with the life of the 
day were in their turn elbowed by courses in his- 
tory, music, drawing, manual training, and other 
innovations. We find the peculiar phenomenon 
of the natural sciences in their turn forced to 
justify their place in the curriculum on the basis 
of the disciplinary value of the training involved! 
Meanwhile, each specialist is convinced that 
his subject is the most important in the curric- 
ulum, and might almost be the only one that is 
really necessary. The poor administrator, in 
addition to having to keep the peace between his 
various departments, must meet the needs of 
the children and of society as he sees them. 
Little more can be done than has been done 
by appealing to authority. The specialist sees 
his subject from the point of view of the subject 
as a whole in its logical completeness and beauty. 
He cannot see it through the eyes of the child, 
nor from the standpoint of the best interests of 
children in view of the lives which they will have 
120 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
to live. Few would question the advisability of 
the study of any great department of knowledge 
in its logical completeness by advanced students. 
But many are beginning to question the value 
of such study for immature children. Even 
Euclid, the perfection of system if there ever was 
one, is being mutilated piecemeal, on the basis of 
the rather obvious hypothesis that simpler por- 
tions of geometry might well precede much more 
difficult portions of arithmetic and algebra. 
The development of a course in general science 
and of a general course in the social sciences 
for children of the junior high school period — 
grades seven, eight, and nine — marks a most 
important step in the reorganization of the 
curriculum that is now under way. But what 
shall be selected for these and other courses — 
least common multiple, cube root, interest, 
keeping a check book, the boundaries of the 
states, the products of Brazil, the spread of dis- 
ease, a city’s water supply, the supreme court, 
Tammany Hall, army military campaigns, the 
waste of national resources, the rule for forming 
plurals, Julius Cesar, George Washington, Tom 
Paine? 
The authorities have had their way in the past, 
and have included things which seem to arouse 
121
-P-A-G-E-134
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
little interest on the part of the pupils, and which 
seem to furnish little or no useful information or 
training which they can employ after they are 
through school. Granted that these two con- 
siderations are of importance, interest and utility, 
the careful study which characterizes the scien- 
tific method is now indispensable. What are the 
worth-while things that are at the same time 
interesting? What are the things which can be 
taught in the schools for which the pupil will 
have some use when he is through school? The 
former problem is one to be answered by study 
in the school; for the latter we must turn to 
society. Ask the bank employees what the 
public should know about banking. Go to the 
magazines and newspapers, and find what the 
reader must know to read intelligently concern- 
ing affairs of current political and social and 
artistic interest. Go to the parents and discover 
what mathematical processes they actually use 
in their daily work. Granting that they would 
use a few more if they were able, it is surprising 
how many chapters of arithmetic would be elim- 
inated if this were the sole criterion. Discover 
the mistakes that people make in their English, 
in their arithmetic, in the other things they do, 
and let the curriculum bear more heavily on 
122
-P-A-G-E-135
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
these things. Investigations of this kind have 
been made by persons who have had regard for 
the rigors of the scientific method. But more 
investigation is needed. Since all the available 
knowledge cannot go into the school curriculum, 
an intelligent selection is the least that can be 
expected of the school in this particular, and this 
intelligent selection cannot be made on the basis 
of the historical importance of the different sub- 
jects, nor upon the basis of the opinion of author- 
ities alone, but it must be made on the basis of a 
careful scientific analysis of society to discover 
what are its needs. 
Methods of Economics — Used to Study the 
Schools 
1. The industrial survey. As schools have 
increased in size beyond the dreams of the early 
settlers of this country, and as an increasing 
number of subjects are placed on the different 
curricula demanding various kinds of apparatus 
and equipment, and as the demands for hygienic 
and artistic buildings have become more insist- 
ent, the problem of cost has grown rather than 
diminished during the last score of years. Va- 
rious finance studies were made early in the pre- 
sent century, but these have given way to the 
123
-P-A-G-E-136
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
more comprehensive undertakings known as 
school surveys. The school survey involves a 
careful study by experts of the whole school 
system of a city or rural region, its equipment and 
its needs in relation to such factors as the popu- 
lation, the character of the people in the different 
portions, their race and vocations, the available 
funds which can be expended, and the most 
immediate needs. 
Clearly, intelligent progress is impossible until 
the situation and the needs are adequately known, 
and this collection of facts as contrasted with 
such airy opinions as are often expressed as to 
‘what we need’ is as characteristic of the method 
of science as the experiment. 
2. The statistical method. We have now viewed 
some of the more important methods of collect- 
ing data and measuring them quantitatively in 
order to make for a better knowledge of children 
and their homes, of the subject matter, and of the 
schools themselves, so that the process of educa- 
tion may on the basis of these facts, be more 
intelligent and more effective. It remains only 
to speak briefly of certain devices employed 
by economists and mathematicians in hand- 
ling such great masses of data as these methods 
bring in. 
124

If all the children in the sixth grade of a city 
school are measured for their ability in the fun- 
damental processes of arithmetic, and we are 
presented with the scores of each child, we are 
baffled by the great number. We do not know 
how to interpret them until they are grouped 
for us perhaps graphically, and the distribution 
compared with the theoretical probability curve 
of Gauss, or at least until we have computed some 
one of the averages, the median, the mean, or 
the mode — the carefully devised measures of 
central tendency. We must also have a measure 
of variability to tell us whether most of the scores 
are grouped close around the average or are 
widely scattered on each side of it indicating 
that many of them are very good and many are 
very bad. For this measure we have the range, 
the mean deviation or the stardard deviation. 
When we have the distribution drawn, and have 
the figures representing the central tendency of 
the scores and the variability of the scores, then 
we are ready to compare this curve and these 
figures with similar ones from other sixth grades 
in other schools to see if they are better or poorer. 
If they are much poorer, the matter needs inves- 
tigation and correction. Perhaps the children 
are more stupid, perhaps teaching methods need 
125
-P-A-G-E-138
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
to be improved or the curriculum altered; or 
perhaps the teacher needs to be released. 
Now if this same sixth grade was also meas- 
ured for arithmetical reasoning, or the ability 
to solve problems in which the pupils had to de- 
cide for themselves whether they should add, 
subtract, multiply, or divide, it might be interest- 
ing to find out if the children who did well on the 
former test were the ones who did well on this 
other. If all the children ranked the same on 
both tests, and this held true in every school; or 
if they were twice as good on the second as on the 
first, or three-into-the-square-root-of-two times 
as good, we should have a scientific law, a state- 
ment of uniformity like the law of gravitation 
which says that bodies attract each other directly 
as their masses and inversely as the square of the 
distance between them. 
Clearly, such an universal statement of rela- 
tionship could not be expected between such 
measures. The children who were good on one 
test would tend to be good on the other, and the 
children who were poor on the one test would 
tend to be poor on the other. This much would 
be satisfactory for the non-scientific mind, just 
as it is sufficient to say that to-day was quite a bit 
warmer than yesterday. But suppose we want 
126
-P-A-G-E-139
  APPLIED TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS 
to know exactly how the scores compare. Here 
is where the very useful coefficient of correlation 
comes in. This figure derived by a fairly com- 
plicated mathematical process, states the extent 
of that relationship. It varies between + 1.00 
and—1.00. The former figure, + 1.00, would 
represent a condition in which the scores of all 
children on both tests were the same; the latter, 
—1.00, would represent the equally preposter- 
ous condition in which the highest child on the 
one test was the lowest on the other, and so on 
for every child. 
Now if this coefficient of correlation is some- 
where between .50 and .go (which is about as 
high as it ever gets) we have a definite relation- 
ship established. Children’s scores on the funda- 
mental processes correlate with their scores on 
arithmetic reasoning about +.30. If this is 
found to be so wherever it is tried out, we have 
discovered a uniformity just as truly as if we 
talked about inverse squares and other relation- 
ships. Abilities move together and not at ran- 
dom, here this way and there that way, but to- 
gether according to certain fixed laws. 
Through the medium of these measures we 
can discover these relationships and tentatively 
formulate them with as much enthusiasm as ever

a uniformity was discovered and formulated by a 
Galileo, a Newton or a Pasteur. Naturally the 
work of Galton, Pearson, Gauss, and Yule has 
borne fruit. Naturally those who adapted these 
statistical measures to educational purposes, 
Cattell, Thorndike, Rugg, Kelly, Otis, Thur- 
stone, and others have uncovered a mine of 
opportunity and potential energy for the formu- 
lation of new truth which cannot but have most 
important consequences for the theory and prac- 
tice of education. —

CONCLUSION 
The Field of Education 
Upon first glance it might strike one that educa- 
tion is merely a happy combination of contri- 
butions from different sources, and that in itself 
it has no independent being, no raison d’étre; that 
it is a mere parasite, sucking the strength of 
certain sciences and living merely as they live. 
This opinion might be confirmed when one con- 
siders on the content side the part that is played 
by the subjects themselves, the Latin, biology, 
history, and other subjects. If education 
borrows its methods for the acquisition of truth 
. from the natural and social sciences, and its 
subject matter from the great bodies of know- 
ledge which as administered in diluted form are 
known as subjects, where does Education itself 
come in! 
Let us consider the last point first. While 
the number is gradually decreasing under the 
vigorous onslaught of brutal facts, there are 
still those who maintain that a knowledge of a 
subject is all that is essential to teach it, and the 
129 
a.
-P-A-G-E-142
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
more knowledge the better teaching. This is 
one of those half truths that make so much 
trouble in the world, and which are sometimes 
found in places where one would least expect to 
find them. To make it a whole truth, it must be 
stated thus: Other things being equal, the more 
knowledge of a particular subject a teacher has 
the greater will be his ability to teach it. But 
the other things may or may not be equal. Spe- 
cialists in the different departments of Latin, 
biology, history, and the rest are doubtless right 
when they say that to do the best teaching as 
full and complete a knowledge of these subjects 
as possible should be possessed by the teacher. 
No educator would take exception to this, insofar 
as knowledge is a factor in the teaching process. 
But knowledge in and of itself will not transfer 
automatically from teacher to pupils, regardless of 
its extent and precision. 
Of course specialists in these different depart- 
ments will be expected to do their share in fur- 
nishing a full and complete knowledge of their 
specialty to prospective teachers. Given this 
knowledge on the part of an instructor the lesson 
of the day takes on new meaning in the light of 
fact and anecdote which the teacher can con- 
tribute. Pupils’ questions need not be put off 
130 
fh
-P-A-G-E-143
  CONCLUSION 
with a peremptory ‘We’ll come to that later,’ or 
‘We haven’t time for questions now,’ or that still 
more easily recognizable evasion, ‘If you look it 
up yourself you will remember it longer.’ Other 
things being equal, adequate knowledge will 
make excellent teaching. 
But what are these other things? Ask any 
group of college students, after you have gained 
their confidence, what they think of some of the 
scholars who meet them for the purpose of in- 
struction. ‘Yes, funny old bird, gets awfully 
excited about his stuff, but nobody knows what 
he is talking about.’ Or of another, ‘He puts 
everybody to sleep; they call his course the 
Pullman.’ Or of another, ‘Yes, he knows his 
stuff all right, has written a couple of ponderous 
and scholarly volumes on the subject; yes, he’s 
an authority,’ this with a touch of pride, but then 
with a smile, ‘He’s a joke, though. I’ve tried, 
and some of the others have, but we can’t get 
anything out of his course.’ These testimonies 
are selected at random, and anybody could mul- 
tiply them by the score. The value of scholar- 
ship is lost because the method is lacking. 
If these things are true in college, how much 
more true are they in high school and elementary 
school. And for our illustration we need not 
131
-P-A-G-E-144
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
resort to the extreme cases of disorder, the in- 
solence, or the wholesale failures which result 
from a lack of teaching skill. Things that the 
person who is not an expert supervisor would not 
notice, a little wrong emphasis here, a failure to 
allow quite enough discussion there, insufficient 
drill, a poor lesson assignment — faults such as 
these make the class period but little better than 
worthless because pupils just fail to get the fact, or 
the point of view, and the teacher doesn’t know it. 
A successful salesman, a powerful speaker, a 
great violinist must have more than a knowledge 
of his product, his subject or his music. He 
must have the skill derived from a long period 
of careful training. In the same way the able 
teacher must have his subject-matter, of course; 
but he must also have the skill to make his subject 
matter effective. He may have a greater native 
capacity than another and need relatively less 
training. But born teachers are few, and: the 
schools must have thousands. And whatever 
the natural ability, be it great or small, it is bound 
to be improved by proper training. 
These ‘other things’ which seldom are equal, 
begin to assume greater importance. There 
seems to be a subject-matter of education quite 
apart from that of the particular subjects which 
132
-P-A-G-E-145
  
  CONCLUSION 
are taught, and teaching method is all that has 
been mentioned. Nothing has been said of 
special supervisory skills, or training in educa- 
tional administration, nor yet of the historical 
and philosophical backgrounds of education. 
Now, let us consider the first question raised, 
namely, is there a field of educational investi- 
gation which is separate from that of the different 
sciences whose contributing methods have been 
discussed? { ‘Tt will at once be recognized that 
the method of science — observation, hypothesis, 
and verification with the use-of various mechani- 
cal and mathematical instruments of precision 
— is common to all sciences.) Furthermore, the 
materials of each of the ditGrent sciences are not 
the exclusive property of that science. The 
physiologist borrows methods, instruments, and 
principles from the biologist, and the biologist 
is just as free to appropriate what the chem- 
ist uses if it helps him to solve his problems. ‘ In 
studying vision, we consult the physicist about 
the refraction of light, the physiologist about the 
structure and function of the eye, the chemist 
about the nature of the visual purple of the ret- 
ina, the neurologist about the neural and cor- 
tical connections, and the psychologist about the 
facts of sensation and perception. 
133

Whatever contribution, then, that any science 
can make the educator may legitimately appro- 
priate if it will help him in the solution of his 
problems, if it will apply to his field. And what 
is his field? What are his problems? Anything 
which has to do with the furtherance of the pro- 
cess of education. And what is the process of 
education? Here we could digress at length were 
it a part of our purpose. Instead, let us put it 
briefly thus: From the psychological viewpoint, 
it is the making of useful changes in the habits, 
skills, knowledge and ideals of individuals. From 
the social viewpoint it is making for better adap- 
tation to and control of the features of the nat- 
ural and social environment. Here is the field 
of education. To these ends should all knowledge 
be canvassed to assist in the process. 
Experimentation in Education 
But this does not mean that this borrowing is 
all that there is to education. True, it employs 
methods of collecting and accurately measuring 
data used by these sciences, but it puts them to 
work in its own field. In addition to this it 
does some investigating on its own account. 
In the first place, it investigates individuals. 
It does this in a more thorough way and inves- 
134
-P-A-G-E-147
CONCLUSION 
tigates more individuals and to more practical 
purpose than the psychologists, if left to them- 
selves, ever would have considered necessary or 
practicable. The nature of these investigations 
has already been suggested. It includes every- 
thing from the careful laboratory ‘examination of 
individuals to the administering of standardized 
tests and scales to large groups, and thereby 
finding the performance of different individuals 
on the different measures with a view to educa- 
tional placement and vocational guidance. 
In the second place, education investigates 
class groups. Some of this work has attained 
considerable prominence as, for example, the 
experimentation which set out to find the trans- 
fer value of habits of neatness formed in con- 
nection with the written work of one school 
subject as it carried over to the papers of another 
subject where neatness was not demanded. A 
device to help control the various factors of such 
experiments on a number of people known as the 
control group has been found to be of great value 
in reducing errors. This control group in all 
essential particulars save the one being tested is 
given the same experience as the other. 
It may be illustrated by an experiment in the 
psychological laboratory. If the object of the 
135
-P-A-G-E-148
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
experiment is to determine the influence of 
caffeine upon efficiency, one group of subjects is 
given the drug and the other, the control group, 
is not. None of the individuals knows whether 
the mixture he takes contains the drug; in all 
other respects, their experiences are the same 
during the course of the experiment — food, 
hours of sleep, amount of school work, exercise, 
and the like. When the different tests of effi- 
ciency are then applied at varying intervals it 
is possible to compare the performance of the 
two groups to see if it differs relatively from their 
performance before the caffeine was used, and so 
become relatively sure that any difference in that 
performance is due to the influence of the drug. 
Important experimentation of this character 
to determine the advantages of different methods 
of teaching is being conducted in various exper- 
imental schools. The outcomes desired are 
formulated, tests devised to test them, and these 
tests are given to the different groups which have 
been taught by the different methods. Thus 
something more tangible than opinion is made 
available for making a choice of methods. 
In the third place, education investigates 
whole schools. While in many experimental 
schools such experiments are performed as have 
136
-P-A-G-E-149
CONCLUSION 
already been discussed, these experimental 
schools are themselves conducted to test out 
certain hypotheses in which their directors have 
great faith. To a person not acquainted with 
these schools this seems a dangerous thing to do. 
It doesn’t seem fair to experiment on the helpless 
children. But in most cases the teachers are 
experts, the equipment is in every way complete, 
and more attention is given to the development 
of each individual child than in the ordinary 
school. Besides, parents usually pay a consid- 
erable amount of tuition that their children may 
be under the direction of these specialists. On 
the whole it seems quite as fair to have special- 
ists experiment in a systematic way as to have 
beginners without the requisite knowledge, train- 
ing, or experience learn to teach by experiment- 
ing on children, a condition which has long 
maintained, and against which there has been 
little complaint from the laity. 
Professor John Dewey is probably more re- 
sponsible than any other one man for the hypo- 
theses which are the guiding principles of some 
of these experimental schools. One of these 
hypotheses is that a truer education comes from 
an adaptation of the school materials to the life 
interests of children. So we have our shops and 
137
-P-A-G-E-150
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION! 
laundries, our general science courses and our 
clubs. Another hypothesis, and one not incom- 
patible with it is that a higher development of 
the individual child comes from greater freedom; 
and so the desks are unscrewed from the floor, 
children walk about as they please and converse 
at will much to the dismay of visitors familiar 
with the old régime. The school, instead of being 
an absolute monarchy, becomes a largely self- 
regulating democracy, which, as it happens, is 
the social and governmental order in which the 
children will move when they leave school. 
Another hypothesis is that the work unit rather 
than the time unit is the better; and so we have 
our Dalton laboratory plan testing this out. 
Now who shall decide upon the truth of these 
hypotheses which, it may be, have a right to be 
called theories? Clearly only he who has made 
exhaustive studies of the results of the different 
forms of management and organization of the 
different experiments. And these studies are not 
the kind made by certain men of prominence who 
are reported to have gone to Europe to ‘study 
conditions,’ and whose acquaintance with Europe 
comes from seeing it from the car window and 
talking with the concierge at the hotel. These 
studies are made, or they must be made if they 
138
-P-A-G-E-151
  CONCLUSION 
are to give us the truth, by means of careful 
measurements and comparisons of performance 
in this school with that in a similar school run 
on a different plan. Because this is extremely 
difficult in view of the expected results, which 
are often statable not in terms of particular 
schoolroom skills but in terms of ideals and 
points of view, these principles upon which the 
schools are run are still theories. And these theo- 
ries will be generally accepted or rejected accord- 
ing as the rigorous method of science is employed 
in measuring and evaluating them. 
Limitations of the Scientific Method in 
Education 
1. Limitations of all the sciences. Science does 
not determine truth unmistakably and for all time. 
As has already been pointed out, many things 
which the world has held as true have been dis- 
carded, and many things which we now believe 
will undoubtedly be disproved. In view of this, 
there are some who lose patience with science. 
They do not like to feel that they continually 
have to be keeping up with something like the 
styles. They prefer to have something that 
is truth once and for all time. These persons 
usually find greater satisfaction in the pro- 
139
-P-A-G-E-152
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
nouncements of mystics which are made with 
less troublesome investigation and which pur- 
port to hold true forever. They are satisfied 
with the ipse dixit of persons-who are quite often 
the founders of religious sects and denomina- 
tions. In other words they become followers of 
authority. 
Goals may thus be set up which may or may 
not bring advantage to them and to society at 
large. It is for scientific inquiry to ascertain 
this as soon as the situation presents itself as a 
problem, and as soon as the proper technique 
has been developed. When, however, these 
ex cathedra pronouncements are made concerning 
the facts of science already established whether 
they be of astronomy or of biology, sociology or 
education, the authoritarians are on dangerous 
ground, and science is all too apt to brush them 
aside, quite deaf to their protestations. 
At this point it might be well to ask the old 
question, What is truth? We may limit our 
discussion to the presentation of two answers. 
The first is: Truth is what one thoroughly be- 
lieves. The second is: Truth is what works. 
Conviction and workability —these are two 
very Se criteria representing two very 
different philosophic viewpoints. 
140
-P-A-G-E-153
CONCLUSION 
The first view can be applied to matters of 
common sense, the things which seem true, the 
things we always consider true, and the things we 
are convinced are true. These things may run 
all the way from belief that a horsechestnut in 
the pocket will keep away rheumatism to belief 
in the inherent goodness of mankind. If you 
believe it with all your heart, if you act upon it, 
for youitistrue. Much that we believe must be 
based on this principle; it is belief without proof, 
and so many important things cannot be proved. 
But one of the things that makes us hold to 
such a belief is that it works. Was the world 
flat before men sailed around it? Probably not. 
From the absolute point of view of any one in- 
dividual who thought so and acted upon that 
belief, it was flat. But now the things that people 
could do if the earth were round have been done. 
People have sailed around it, for example. The 
theory that it is round works. This is the basis 
upon which scientific truths are built, and is 
called pragmatism. If every person who carried 
a horsechestnut escaped rheumatism, and every 
person who did not had it, the cure could be said to 
work. The truth would be established pragmati- 
cally that horsechestnuts keep off rheumatism. 
Similarly, the experiment of Pasteur which has 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
already been referred to ‘worked.’ Predictions 
based upon it also ‘worked.’ And largely as a 
result of his investigation we pasteurize milk and 
we vaccinate to prevent an epidemic of smallpox. 
These things have been found to work out in 
practice. 
What is meant by this limitation of the sciences 
— that they do not determine the truth unmis- 
takably and for all time — is that some things 
which work for a while may cease to act accord- 
ing to predictions under certain other circum- 
stances. A new hypothesis, then, has to be 
formed, or a new theory promulgated and tested, 
which will more fully square with the facts. 
What is sometimes considered as another 
limitation of all the sciences is that they do not 
Furnish objectives and ideals. For example, a 
science of chemistry makes possible the manu- 
facture of chlorine gas, but does not determine 
whether it shall be used to destroy armies or to 
cure acold. A scientific time-and-motion study 
shows what is the most efficient way to do a 
certain piece of work, but it does not tell us 
whether it is right to subject a worker to addi- 
tional strain and monotony. The science of 
chemistry cannot discourse upon the ideals of 
warfare; it can only furnish facts and predict 
142
-P-A-G-E-155
CONCLUSION 
consequences. The sciences of psychology and 
economics cannot speak concerning the ethics of 
certain industrial processes and their relation to 
the worker; they can only present certain facts 
and predict certain consequences. It is no 
concern of the scientist which set of conse- 
quences is chosen. 
The same position is frequently held in regard 
to ideals in the field of education, where they are 
commonly called objectives. Various lists of 
objectives of education have been formulated 
such as that of the Commission on the Reorgani- 
zation of Secondary Education! which lists 
health, command of fundamental processes, 
worthy home membership, vocation, civic educa- 
tion, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. 
Given these objectives, it is sometimes contended, 
educators can set about the task of evaluating 
them scientifically and embodying them in school 
practice. The ideals themselves, however, must 
come not from science but from philosophy, 
ethics, and religion. 
It must be admitted that this is a very plausible 
view of the situation, and that it is widely held. 
And this is no more than natural in view of the 
1 Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education. Wash. 
Government Printing Office, 1918. 
143
-P-A-G-E-156
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
narrow and uneven advances which have charac- 
terized man’s inquiry into the nature of the world 
in which he lives. Asa result of this, science has 
come to be viewed as particular subject-matter 
— as chemistry, physics, biology, etc. — and not 
as a method of solving problems wherever these 
problems may chance to rise. When science is 
viewed as subject-matter, ideals and objectives 
cannot but be regarded as separate. Chemistry 
cannot be looked to to abolish war, or psychology 
and economics to banish industrial discontent. 
But when science is viewed as a method, ideals 
and objectives become the direct outgrowth of 
its application. The cure for the deficiencies of 
Science is more science. 
Let us illustrate this point with the health 
objective, although any other might be used. 
The older view would be that this objective finds 
its source in the words of persons with a religious 
or philosophic training who say that health is an 
ideal which educators should strive for in their 
improvement of the schools. The position here 
maintained is that health, as an objective, is a 
direct outcome of the application of the method 
of science.

Givler, R. C.: The Ethics of Hercules. Alfred A. Knopf, 1924.

-P-A-G-E-157
CONCLUSION 
The first step in this process, we have seen, is 
seeing problems. In different schoolrooms cer- 
tain difficulties confront the teachers. Some pu- 
pils do not pay attention when they are spoken 
to, and some will not learn to read. Others 
“talk through their noses,” or let their mouths 
hang open, and are exceedingly indolent. Still 
others, who are thin and pale, are lazy and fall 
asleep when they should be studying. These 
and similar problems have presented themselves 
to every teacher. In an earlier day they were 
all dealt with in a similar and summary fash- 
ion. A whipping was good pedagogy, and re- 
ligion at least furnished no other ideal. Indeed, 
it aided and abetted corporal punishment, for it 
taught that children were “‘conceived in sin and 
born in iniquity,” and that the mortification of 
the flesh was the sole way to overcome the origi- 
nal mistakes of Adam, and to bring displeasure 
to a very real devil. 
The second step is the discovery of the solu- 
tion. Other suggestions as to the best ways to 
meet these difficulties began to arise as the facts 
came to be known. Some of these, when tried 
out, seemed to produce more desirable results. 
The children who wouldn’t pay attention were 
1 Above, p. 38. 
145
-P-A-G-E-158
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
discovered to be slightly deaf and were seated 
nearer the front. Those who couldn’t read, it 
was found, could hardly see the printed page, and 
glasses were prescribed. Throats were examined, 
and diet was inquired into. But these sugges- 
tions could not have come to the schoolroom had 
it not been for the development of the science of 
medicine which had discovered the facts con- 
cerning poor hearing, faulty vision, diseased 
tonsils, and malnutrition, had shown the conse- 
quences of these conditions, and evolved reme- 
dies. Attention to these matters increased with 
the increase of scientific discovery. 
The third step, then, is the gathering together 
of all these things, previously viewed as sep- 
arate problems, into one generalization which is 
in every sense an hypothesis. This hypothesis 
might be stated as follows: If steps are taken to 
keep pupils healthy, they do better work in 
school and afterwards. Here is the generali- 
zation arrived at as other hypotheses are ar- 
rived at. It becomes a working principle which, 
in practice, comes to have all the force of a nat- 
ural law. Instead of springing fully panoplied 
from the brain of some philosopher or mystic, it 
has come as the result of a long process. On the 
one hand are the countless school problems 
146
-P-A-G-E-159
  CONCLUSION 
which have been demanding attention. On the 
other are the careful scientific investigations not 
only in the field of education but also in chem- 
istry, biology, medicine, etc., which have pre- 
sented the facts and the consequences and 
have thus aided in the discovery of the solutions. 
There are some who consider that the desire of 
people for healthful schools is no part of the 
scientific method. By the same token, the de- 
sire of investigators for the truth is no part of it. 
Both of these desires are given elements in man’s 
nature. They are data just as other observable 
phenomena are data and are so considered in the 
process of testing an hypothesis. 
Thus any objectives and ideals, whether they 
appear in the field of education or in the realm 
of the phenomena with which chemistry deals, 
or psychology or economics, come as a result of 
solving many problems. They have value if the 
scientific method is used in evaluating the sug- 
gested solutions to these problems, and in testing 
the hypotheses which are formulated. Science, 
regarded as method and not as subject-matter, in- 
stead of being limited by the inability to furnish 
objectives and ideals, in reality develops and 
formulates them. 
2. Limitations of the biological sciences. When 
147 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
we take up the study of the phenomena of life, 
we find a certain unpredictability which is most 
baffling, and which makes careful investigation 
and the establishment of law difficult. When 
Halley predicted that a comet would come around 
again at a certain time, the comet appeared ac- + 
cording to schedule. When the psychologist . 
predicts that the small child will come around 
again at meal-time, he has a good chance of 
being right. But the boy may have gone to a 
baseball game and may not show up until an 
hour later; or he may have decided to run away 
and so not turn up at all. If you put a quart of 
water on the scales in Maine and another in 
\ California, the weight in each case will be the 
same. But if, after giving intelligence tests, you 
put the upper ten per cent of the children in the 
sixth grade of a Maine school in one group, and 
the upper ten per cent of the children in the sixth 
grade of a California school into one group, your 
two groups will differ widely in the range of their 
intelligence. 
Then there is, in addition, the difficulty in 
isolating and controlling the factors for a careful 
experiment. A pupil fails in his schoolwork. 
How do we account for it? Low intelligence, 
laziness, neglect at home, poor health, too much 
148
-P-A-G-E-161
CONCLUSION | 
time at parties or at sports? One or all of these 
things may have a bearing on the boy’s failure, 
but to control the factors so that it is possible 
to say exactly how much influence each has is 
next to impossible. However, the method of 
partial correlation is being employed to separate 
the influence of simultaneous contributing fac- 
tors when those factors can be measured, and 
thus this difficulty is being overcome. 
3- Limitations of education as a science. Apart 
from the limitations which education shares with 
other sciences, there are some handicaps which 
though not peculiar to education are unfortu- 
nately all too commonly operative. The first 
of these handicaps is the hang-over of the influ- 
ence of authority and speculation. These have 
an even larger influence than is necessary. The 
second is too meager scientifically derived in- 
formation, too few data, too few accurate meas- 
ures, so that it is often necessary to fall back 
upon authority and opinion. The third of these 
handicaps which is now being corrected as rap- 
idly as may be, is the deficient scholarship and 
training of too many educators. Some of these, 
unfortunately, are the ones who do the most 
advertising, and as a result the whole progress of 
education is called into question or misunder- 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
stood by those who judge education by these 
persons only. 
Education More than a Science 
There is little to be gained in debating the 
question — Is education a science? We have 
demonstrated that it employs the scientific 
method in the search for new truth, and is so 
building up an organized body of knowledge even 
apart from the pronouncements of authority 
and of opinion. If this makes a pure science 
education is one. If it does not, education is not a 
pure science. 
But it does more. It employs the principles 
so derived for the solution of its problems. If 
this makes an applied science, education is one. 
If it does not, education is not an applied science. 
But it does more than this. It employs in- 
dividuality in the selection of principles and 
methods in particular cases. That fine thing 
not yet satisfactorily analyzed called personality 
that the musician must have, and that the artist 
must have, and which each must somehow get 
into his work, the teacher also must have. Just 
as the musician must know the laws and principles 
of music, and the painter those of color com- 
bination and design, and employ these, so too 
150
-P-A-G-E-163
CONCLUSION 
must the teacher know the principles of educa- 
tion, must have a knowledge of children and 
schools and processes gained from other than 
empirical sources. And to the extent that this 
thing called personality is operative, education 
is more than a pure science, more than an ap- 
plied science. It is an art. 
The study of the history of education up to 
the present time is an inspiring study because it 
traces the crystalization of the ideals of different 
periods of history. Each generation desired to | 
make of the next generation what it had desired 
to be and had often failed in being. So it organ- 
ized schools which should carry out this work. 
But it is a sad study, too, for it is the history of 
blind trial and error, of mistakes made over and 
over again, of useless waste, of sad neglect. And 
there is nothing to indicate that this condition 
of affairs would not have continued indefinitely 
if a new light had not been thrown on these pro- 
blems because of the efforts of those individuals 
who were willing to break with the past, and 
employ the method of science to help answer 
their questions for them. 
It is easy to contrast the one-room New 
England grammar school building with the 
beautiful school plants of the present day. It is 
I51
-P-A-G-E-164
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN EDUCATION 
easy to contrast the condition of affairs which 
maintained when Horace Mann gave up a 
promising career of the law and took out his 
horse and buggy and drove up and down New 
England attacking that deadly apathy which is 
worse than open opposition and awakening pub- 
lic opinion to the need for normal schools, with 
the conditions of the present when there are 
colleges of education in all the great universities. 
And to what end? To the end that the high- 
est ideals may be made corporate, and may 
operate in the institution of the schools. To 
find out how they may be best made to operate, 
and to train persons that this knowledge may 
become effective — this is the task, a task which 
can be satisfactorily performed only as educators 
learn to employ the method of science in the 
solution of their problems.

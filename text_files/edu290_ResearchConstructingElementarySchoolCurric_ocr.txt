v. 3 FOREWORD    
“To bring together the elements for the construction of a suitable cur- 
riculum for the boys and girls of American public schools,” was the purpose 
of the Department of Superintendence in its appointment of the Commis- 
sion on the Curriculum. The 1924 Yearbook of the Department laid the 
basis for this program through its statement of general educational aims and 
objectives, through its survey of current curriculum practice, and through 
its proposed machinery for coéperative effort in curriculum revision in a 
local community. 
When the Commission on the Curriculum met in July, 1924, the ques- 
tion was, What can a national commission do that will be of greatest help 
to superintendents of schools who are faced with the problem of curriculum 
revision? The commission decided that the most needed service was the 
collection and analysis of outstanding research studies in each of the sub- 
jects of the elementary curriculum. It was known that many such studies 
of high value had been made which shouldbe considered in the revision of 
curricula; but they were, for the most part, inaccessible because of their 
technical form, or because of their publication in isolated monographs. or 
magazines, or because of their fragmentary distribution. A review of 
selected scientific studies in one volume, together with an analysis and 
summary of them in terms easily understandable, was the service for sci- 
entific curriculum construction which the Commission on the Curriculum 
decided to render. 
The work of carrying out the plan was delegated to the Division of 
Research of the National Education Association. The time allotted was 
less than six months. The studies to be reviewed were of a technical 
nature and in fairness to their authors could only be reviewed by specialists 
thoroughly familiar with each subject. It would have been impossible for 
any one person to do the work in the limited time. The leadership of the 
Nation in the curriculum field was sought out. “Twelve subcommittees 
were appointed, one for each elementary school subject. A search for 
material was made in universities, colleges, and school systems throughout 
the country. As far as possible all published and unpublished elementary 
curriculum studies were collected. 
Because of the time limit and the fact that the reports of all subcom- 
mittees had to be included in one volume, the studies reviewed are selected 
and not comprehensive. In some fields much more research has been 
done than in others. This fact explains why certain subjects are given 
greater space in the Yearbook. Parts I and II were reduced to a minimum 
in order to give as much space as possible to the review of research studies. 
The Department of Superintendence is most appreciative and deeply 
indebted for the nation-wide codperation which it has received. The

  Division of Research has bent every effort to make the Yearbook. possible. 
Seventy-five curriculum specialists have given gratis of their time, training, 
and experience in analyzing the studies collected. Through their unselfish 
efforts this great piece of codperative research was made possible. Their 
most important reward will be in the testing out and application of their 
findings, to the end that the boys and girls of our public schools may have 
a curriculum built on scientific principles and American ideals.

  PART I._A COOPERATIVE PLAN FOR THE REVISION 
OF THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
CURRICULUM 
CHAPTER I 
y ‘HE PUBLIC SCHOOL curriculum has a-large share in determin- 
ing the‘Nation’s present and future progress. “Through its public 
schools, America is endeavoring to pass on to its youth all that has 
been found best in the past: the knowledge, habits, skills, attitudes, and 
ideals most useful to individual and national life at present; and in addi- 
tion, it attempts to supply youth with the necessary tools, understanding, 
foresight, and incentive for the future advancement of its people. Knowl- 
edge and skill, disseminated among the masses of the people, according to 
a leading economist, constitute a nation’s greatest wealth. The habits of 
a people determine the degree of faith that other nations accord it; and 
the idealism of its citizens is a nation’s salvation. Since the public school 
is designed to disseminate knowledge, develop right habits, and implant 
proper ideals, it may rightly be termed the life insurance of civilization. 
The public school curriculum determines what boys and girls are taught 
in school. With the exception of the personality of the teacher, no other 
educational factor equals it in importance. ‘The elementary school cur- 
riculum lays the foundation of every child’s education; and it constitutes 
all the school training of about three fifths of America’s children. 
Why the Elementary School Curriculum Needs Revision 
The elementary ’school curriculum is a more vital factor in the develop- 
ment of national life today than ever before. In pioneer days, ordinary 
living at home and in the community, directed by insistent family needs, 
provided a fairly adequate preparation for life. ‘Then the task of the 
American public school was mainly to supplement the life of the home, 
church, and community by adding the Three R’s. As time went on, the 
public school was called upon to supply more and more formal education. 
Many new courses were added to the traditional subjects. Unfortunately, 
there was often lack of synthesis of the whole, since additions and modi- 
fications were made without plan or system; and the result in many in- 
stances is ‘‘the amorphous product of generations of tinkering.’ Unless 
school practice is abreast or ahead of the time, it cannot be a directive 
power. ‘There has been too much of a tendency for convention and tradi- 
tion to determine curricula, rather than practical, present-day life demands. 
An active principle which is now coming to be recognized in the selection 
of content is that of utility in a broad sense. Will the inclusion of a par- 
ticular topic or subject increase the effectiveness of the individual? Will 
it influence life for good? Will it build character? ‘Today we are using 
a pragmatic philosophy. 
[9]
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
Pruning out the dead wood, selecting minimum essentials from total 
possible content, adding supplementary material—tinkering with the cur- 
riculum—will no longer answer the need. A’ complete revision is de- 
manded by both educators and laymen. Both groups demand a new cur- 
riculum, expressive of the changed conditions of modern civilization and 
reshaped in the light of our better understanding of child life and the 
learning processes. 
The Need for Curriculum Revision—What the Layman Sees 
The layman too often views the public school curriculum from these 
two angles: (1) growing costs, and (2) lack of thoroughness in essen- 
tials. The first viewpoint is sane, providing that it is positive and not 
negative. When larger numbers of children are educated and given the 
better and richer education which civilization demands, the cost is certain 
to increase—it cannot be otherwise—and the cost must be met. More 
careful selection of curriculum materials should be made, but it is doubt- 
ful that it will or should result in reduced expenditures. 
The second viewpoint from which the layman considers the need for 
curriculum revision is a supposed lack of thoroughness in essentials. ‘There 
may be some justification for this attitude. ‘The only reliable evidence, 
however, such as the Springfield tests and the Boston tests of 1845, has 
demonstrated that most public schools of today are securing better results 
in the so-called “fundamentals” with a heterogeneous mass of children 
than the schools of half a century ago secured with selected groups. The 
argument for ‘“‘cutting out fads and frills” is sometimes only a plea for 
the old-time, traditional school program, which would be an anachronism 
in present-day life. The American school must expand until it offers 
whatever is necessary to develop intelligent American citizenship. 
The Need for Curriculum Revision—What the Educator Sees 
The educator also sees the need of curriculum revision from two angles: 
(1) the expansion of the field of knowledge, and the need for a dis- 
criminating selection of what is best suited to meet present social demands; 
and (2) provision for character building, including the development of 
broad interests, liberal views, and the establishment of right social and 
ethical attitudes. ‘The limited time that the average child spends in school 
in contrast to the vast amount of knowledge which one might acquire, the 
complexity of modern life with its varied demands, and the necessity of 
developing individual talents are conditions which lead educators not only 
to restudy and analyze the aims and objectives of education, but also to 
demand a complete revision of the curriculum to express the new concep- 
tions of education. The educator is seeking as the major products of his 
enterprise strong character and right conduct, built not on precept, but 
fashioned through years of right thinking during lesson hours and prop-
-P-A-G-E-11

erly controlled behavior in school activities. Teachers not only want their 
pupils to meet the standard tests in academic achievement but, what is 
more important, to meet successfully the tests of life, even to the point of 
temptation. For this reason, although teachers may rightly expect that 
character development will be an important by-product of all good instruc- 
tion, they have definitely in mind the moral qualities which they wish to 
develop in their pupils, such as: honesty, industry, self-control, courtesy, 
unselfishness, service, appreciation of beauty, openmindedness, codperation, 
responsibility, sympathy, desire for improvement, adaptability, courage, 
initiative, thoroughness, self-judgment, thrift, faith in mankind, and rever- 
ence. Every true teacher hopes to develop these qualities through life situ- 
ations as they arise. 
When the educator fully comprehends that the objectives which the 
school must serve today are health, training for a vocation, citizenship, 
worthy home membership, the profitable use of leisure, and ethical char- 
acter, he keenly feels the need of a thorough revision of the present public 
school curriculum. 
These viewpoints of the layman and the educator relative to the need 
for curriculum revision can and must be harmonized into a working agree- 
ment. 
Present Activity in Elementary School Curriculum Revision 
The aim of the modern educator includes the aim of the layman, thor- 
oughness in essentials, and goes far beyond it. The teacher strives to have 
his pupils spell more correctly the words in common use, use the arith- 
metical processes necessary in modern life with more speed and accuracy, 
and read more and with greater rapidity and comprehension. In addition, 
the teacher would have his pupils appreciate the rights of others, and 
respect the law; in other words, he would have him establish a proper 
relationship between himself and society. 
The public-spirited layman cherishes these same objectives for the public 
school. He, too, would have the curriculum revised so that the above 
objectives may be attained. The result is that curriculum revision is in 
progress in all parts of the country. Several of the national societies and 
foundations, as well as university and state committees, are engaged in 
studying the problem of the elementary school curriculum. Among these 
are the National Society for the Study of Education, the American Asso- 
ciation of University Women, The Commonwealth Foundation, The 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, the California Cur- 
riculum Committee, and Teachers College of Columbia University. 
Many state, county, and city courses of study have been rebuilt recently, 
or are in the process of revision. Representative examples of large city 
school systems where courses of study have been revised recently are: 
Berkeley, California; Los Angeles, California; Denver, Colorado; Balti- 
more, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Trenton,
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
New Jersey. In response to a request for recent elementary courses of 
study, 200 representative cities, counties, and states replied that they had 
published courses of study since 1920. ‘This is indicative of the vast 
amount of activity in curriculum revision in all parts of the country. 
Should Curriculum Revision be Done Independently or by 
CoGperation? 
Some of the work in curriculum revision is the result of months of care- 
ful study and the pooling of leadership in the field of each subject. In 
some cities, however, the work has been done hastily and unscientifically ; 
in every city there has been much duplication of effort. When each com- 
.munity attempts to solve all its curriculum problems in isolation, the results 
are likely to be unsatisfactory and expensive. When scores of cities work 
independently, there is an unfortunate waste of time and effort in the du- 
plication of bibliographies, in the independent collection of data through 
repeated questionnaires and other forms of inquiry, and in the formulation 
of major principles. As a matter of fact, by the process of independent 
action, only those school systems which can afford to expend thousands of 
dollars on curriculum revision can make independently a comprehensive 
and satisfactory study of the problem. Curriculum making is becoming a 
specialized, technical task, which requires: (1) the study of social needs, 
including those peculiar to a local community, (2) analyses of the abilities 
and interests of growing children, (3) experimental study of the learning 
process, and (4) an understanding of the local school system, the temper 
and capacity of its teachers and administrators; in other words, what can 
be expected of them in helping in the development and putting into effect 
of a new course of study at a given time. One curriculum specialist has 
wisely said: “To make a radical selection and reorganization of the best in 
a civilization is not something that can be lightly undertaken or easily 
accomplished. Conferences and the pronouncements of those in official 
positions are quite inadequate. ‘Two methods are needed in curriculum 
making: (1) the subjective method of expert teaching opinion, and (2) the 
objective method of expert analysis of social and psychological needs.” 
Both processes should work together. 
Contribution of Research to Curriculum Revision 
During the past ten years, methods of determining what is useful and 
what is not have been devised in part, and they are still in process of 
development. Some important results have already been obtained. 
Part III, Curricular Problems and Their Scientific Solution, is the work 
of sixty-nine curriculum specialists and subject specialists. It pools the 
most important research studies available and presents bibliographies that 
have already been tested out and found helpful by a number of local com- 
munities, and suggests problems which local committees have faced, but 
which require further research for their solution.
-P-A-G-E-13

A National Committee Should Present Raw Material Rather Than 
a National Curriculum for General Acceptance 
A strictly uniform American curriculum for the elementary schools is 
hardly possible, because of the great variations in social, industrial, and 
economic conditions. Furthermore, it may not be desirable, because of 
our democratic ideal of recognizing local needs and conditions and of con- 
sidering individual differences of children. ‘There are three elements. in 
every course of study: (1) the general core that meets nation-wide re- 
quirements; (2) the part that has to do with the local community, which 
may even vary for different communities in the same city; and (3) adjust- 
ments for individual children and varying groups. of pupils. 
In its Second Yearbook, the Department of Superintendence set up the 
machinery for devising, revising, and supervising a curriculum in an indi- 
vidual city. This machinery was based on the idea of arousing the interest 
and securing the coédperation of the local staff, and, at the same time, of 
assembling ideas from the outside. The Commission on the Curriculum 
has deemed it advisable to apply the same method to the work it has in 
hand. In Part II of this Yearbook, various ideas as to possible variations 
in the curriculum to meet community and individual needs are presented ; 
and accompanying each statement, general principles to guide local course 
of study committees in the adaptation of a curriculum to their particular 
community and to special groups of pupils are suggested. 
A Central Agency Could Render Invaluable Service as a Clearing- 
house for Curriculum Research 
The research studies here reviewed are illustrative of the kind of work 
which is essential to scientific curriculum revision. More of these are 
needed. ‘The fact that practice should keep pace with research also calls 
for the testing of the findings presented in Part III. In many instances 
research at the present time is ahead of practice. 
The Commission on the Curriculum presents this Yearbook as the first 
comprehensive effort to develop a codperative plan for curriculum revision. 
The commission believes that there should be a central agency, continuing 
from year to year, which would act as a clearing-house for school systems 
which desire to codperate in the work of curriculum revision, In other 
words, provision should be made for the exchanging of bibliographies, for 
rendering available research studies as soon as they are completed, and for 
the interchanging of the findings of local communities, as classroom 
teachers test out certain content and-procedures. Just as scientifically 
trained workers in our laboratories furnish us with the bulk of scientific 
literature, so in the future more and more of our educational contributions 
should come from teachers, administrators, and research workers trained 
scientifically to observe children and analyze the needs of society.
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
It is the nature of education to be ever progressing. Continuous, con- 
structive, scientific study must be carried on, if the public school curriculum 
is to keep pace with social demands and to become a contributory element 
to more intelligent and abundant living. 
The Commission on the Curriculum proposes that for the school year 
1925-1926 as many school systems, as will, shall agree to codperate in 
testing the findings of the research studies reported in this Yearbook, that 
new studies be undertaken, and that the results be placed at the disposal of 
the schools of the country through the Department of Superintendence as a 
central agency. :

  CHAPTER II 
PART II. POSSIBLE VARIATIONS IN CURRICULA TO 
MEET COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL NEEDS'* 
OST of the present elementary school curricula are based upon 
M the theory that the course given in the first six grades covers 
the so-called tool subjects of learning; that these subjects are 
fundamental to the education of all children and should consequently be 
given approximately in the same degree to all normal children; that dif- 
ferences in aptitudes and life plans should be recognized at about the age 
of twelve; and that elective work should begin in the junior high school 
and should continue in increasing degree through high school, college, and 
university. 
Although this means that all children, except atypicals, shall take the 
same subjects during the first six grades of the elementary school, it does 
not mean that the content of each subject shall be the same for all chil- 
dren, or that the method of approach to a particular subject or topic, or 
the time allotment will be the same. For, notwithstanding in each subject 
of the elementary school curriculum there is a general core which is. uni- 
versal and belongs to the nation, there is additional material which must 
be adapted to community and individual needs. 
The General Core of the Elementary School Curriculum Belongs 
to the Nation 
For the drill subjects, Part III would seem to indicate that esearch 
will have soon determined what the general core of the elementary school 
curriculum should be—that is, the irreducible minimum for all normal 
children in various years of work the country over. 
Charles M. Reinoehl, in his Analytic Survey of. State Courses ‘of Study 
for Rural Elementary Schools,? lists topics which are common to-néarly 
all present state courses of study. In his opinion, these topics, with some 
modifications, include much information of which every American has need. 
He shows that there are social and economic problems national in scope. 
‘There are problems peculiar to a state, but typical of problems in other

states. There are problems truly representative and suggestive in char- 
acter, which with proper adaptation are fully as valuable as those of wider 
application. ‘There is also a considerable body of subject-matter requir- 
ing drill; of which every normal American child has need. Reinoehl’s 
study is intended to indicate the content of the core of the rural elementary 
school curriculum. ‘The studies reviewed in Part III are applicable to 
communities of every sort. However, even if research should determine 
what the minimum essentials in curricular content should be, every course 
of study committee is still faced with the problem of additional adaptations 
for its particular school system. 
Two Guiding Principles for Curricular Adaptation 
What are the general principles for differentiation which should guide 
course of study committees? Two guiding principles invariably present 
themselves. 
The first principle has to do with education’s material, the individual 
child, for whom educational activities are being planned. The second 
principle has to do with the child’s environment. Nature and nurture are 
important factors to be taken into consideration when planning a cur- 
riculum. 
Differentiation of Curricula to Fit Individual Needs 
«The fact that pupils differ in ability to master the work offered in the 
ordinary curriculum in any subject is well known to any one familiar with 
the teaching of children. Hence in fairness to the rights of each child, it 
is not only impractical but impossible to teach all children in the same man- 
* ner‘or to give them the same content. 
Ability grouping and the curriculum problem—One superintendent who 
has. made a special study of the adaptation of curricula to individual chil- 
dren in his school system states that about six or eight children in every 
ten can work with satisfactory profit with the same educational projects. 
Two of every ten children can usually achieve more satisfactory results if 
given an opportunity with projects more advanced than that of the so-called 
“average six” of each ten. There are also frequently two of each ten who 
cannot, or at least do not experience the same or equivalent success as do 
the others in the group. The proportions may vary, but the differences 
remain. 
Curriculum making, therefore, has specifically to do with the regular 
grade work of children of average ability. It also has to do with ungraded 
classes of children who are below the average group of the class in actual 
results secured as indicated by the grades obtained by each in school. In 
addition there is the rapid promotion class, or the class capable of a wide 
scope of comprehensive offerings, but with the possibility of early promo- 
tion from grade to grade held in abeyance. In larger communities admin-

istrative action is imperative in dealing with the problem of the physically 
handicapped, as well as of children with emotional instability. These 
pupils may rank well in intellectual performance but, because of physical 
disabilities or emotional instability, they cannot profit from the standard 
curriculum unless many adjustments are made. Similarly, special courses 
must be arranged for the predelinquent. 
Number of ability groups—The size of the school usually determines 
the number of ability groups that it is administratively possible to organize. 
Even when there are as many as five or six ability groups, there will be 
considerable variation between individual members in any one group. The 
larger the number of groups, the smaller should be the variation in ability 
between individual students. 
What are the general principles that every course of study committee 
attempting differentiation of material should recognize? ‘This question is 
one which deserves further study. In the absence of any better evidence, 
these principles are tentatively proposed for discussion. ~ 
Major principles of curricular differentiation for ability groups: 
1. Methods of teaching and standards of attainment differ for groups of 
different levels of ability, but there are real possibilities for achievement in 
any class in the public school. If possible, teachers should find at least one 
socially useful thing at which even the very limited? pupil can succeed, 
train him in this, and let him experience honest success. 
2. Minimum essentials must be clearly stated for all, but the funda- 
mentals set forth for the lowest group must be included as a part of the 
material for the highest groups. It is important in a democracy that cer- 
tain information shall be the common heritage of all. In so far as they 
are able to acquire it, all children should have the best of the social heritage 
of the race. 
3. The aims, objectives, and outcomes for all subjects should be defi- 
nitely set forth for the different ability groups. For the most part, there 
should be a common background for these aims. ‘The methods and em- 
phasis are necessarily different, as are the immediate objectives and out- 
comes, but the same ultimate aim of education should guide all teaching. 
The same philosophy of education is back of whatever differentiation is 
made. 
4. Definite standards of attainment must be indicated for all levels. 
Much study is needed to determine the amount and quality of work which 
we rightly can expect from pupils of different levels of ability. 
5. The dull pupil should have extensive opportunity for drill. Contrary 
to general belief, the slow thinker is not necessarily the accurate thinker. 
Nor does the child who learns slowly necessarily have a more retentive 
memory than the bright child. ‘ 
1 The term “limited”? is used to designate those pupils who do not seem to have the 
ability to do the work of the standard elementary school curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
  ‘6. Limited pupils usually differ from superior pupils in their lack of 
ability to project themselves into new situations. The superior child with 
his quick imagination and ready powers of generalization does this very 
easily. On the other hand, the limited pupil usually cannot reason out 
general principles or methods of attack but has to learn largely by imita- 
tion and successive experiences. 
_ To illustrate, according to W. J. Osburn, a dull child who has learned 
8 from 13 will probably be confused by the 48 from 53 which occurs in 
the exercise 534 divided by 6. To a gifted child this presents little diffi- 
culty. Dull pupils must have direct teaching on all of the important ele- 
ments of instruction, whereas gifted pupils will probably master the ma- 
terial after one tenth of it has been taught. There are more than 1200 
combinations in arithmetic which everyone must know in order to carry 
on ordinary computation with integers; yet we know gifted pupils can 
attain. a reasonable mastery of this material by the presentation of 180 
combinations; that is, the 45 principal combinations in each of the four 
processes. ‘This is not true of the limited pupil. 
7. The content of the course of study for the slow group should stand 
the test of practicability. A large majority of slow pupils leave school 
early, not because of economic necessity, but because the traditional cur- 
riculum does not meet their needs and interests. In order to meet their 
needs, the work must be of such a character that it will be especially ap- 
plicable to their every-day life needs. Local course of study committees 
must be guided by what they know almost certainly lies ahead of certain 
groups of students. 
8. The content of the course of study for the gifted group must be en- 
riched, not necessarily by more difficult or more extensive material of the 
same type, but by a wider and more varied choice. Certain additional 
material may also be presented, as the beginning of foreign language study, 
and. other work which will provide for initiative, organization, and devel- 
opment of the many-sided interests of the superior child, for which there 
is little time in the average class. 
9, The course of study should make provisions for the rate of progress 
which may be expected in the various ability groups. The gifted child 
should probably be allowed to complete the elementary course in six years 
or less; for in addition to enrichment of courses, there is sometimes advan- 
tage in acceleration in the elementary grades when much of the work is in 
drill subjects. The normal group should finish the six grades of the ele- 
mentary school in six years; and the under-average should be expected 
to make normal progress as far as possible, within their own group. In 
each grade the atypical group should be expected to acquire academic 
knowledge only in so far as their capacities permit, without excessive 
expenditure of time. 
10. Suggestions as to methods and procedure best adapted to the dif- 
ferent levels should be included in the course of study. Critical investiga-
-P-A-G-E-21

tions should be made of our present methods and their relative effectiveness 
in reaching pupils of varying ability, social background, and environment. 
11. It is generally conceded that the keynote in the education of a child 
of limited mental ability is the establishment of specific habits. 
12. The differentiated subject-matter for different groups should be 
», elastic in content, so that it can be modified to meet individual needs as 
well as group needs. For example, children from foreign-speaking homes 
may have the same mental ability as other children in their group, but they 
have a different social background, which the teacher must consider in her 
approach to the subject-matter which she wants her pupils to acquire. 
Individual Instruction and the Curriculum Problem 
‘The viewpoint is pretty largely accepted that the needs of individual 
children can be far better met when children are classified on an ability 
basis determined by such factors as seeming innate mental capacity, teacher’s 
estimate of ability, previous accomplishment, industry, health, and social 
maturity, than they can in a heterogeneous class. The larger the number 
of groups, the more nearly homogeneous can each group be made. In 
every instance, however, there will still be considerable variation between 
individuals in any one group. Hence, some argue that individual instruc- 
tion is the only plan whereby the curriculum can really be made to fit all 
children. 
The Winnetka Plan of Meeting Individual Differences 
Carleton W. Washburne, superintendent of schools of Winnetka, Illi- 
nois, discusses this point as follows: 
Children differ as individuals, not as artificially formed groups. The 
children of high intelligence quotient will usually do better work than 
children of low intelligence quotient; children who are good in one subject 
are more likely than not to be good in other subjects; but the exceptions 
to these rules are numerous in every class or school and the variations 
within each group of ability are far wider than the variations between the 
central tendencies of any two ability groups. 
Where children are allowed to advance individually at their own natural 
rates, as in Winnetka, for example, it has been found that twenty-four per 
’ cent of the children who are advanced in reading are only average or actu- 
ally retarded in arithmetic and that sixteen per cent of the children who 
are advanced in reading are average or retarded in language. ‘The same 
sort of thing is true of the children who are advanced in arithmetic or in 
language, although the percentages of the children average or retarded in 
the other subjects is somewhat lower in these cases. 
Similarly, twenty-five per cent of children of high intelligence quotient, 
123 to 166, tend to progress in school at an average rate or a little below 
average, while forty-nine per cent of children of low intelligence quotient, 
60 to 100, tend to progress at an average rate or a rate above average.
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  If children are divided into three ability groups as the result of an intel- 
ligence test, the high group containing the quarter with the highest intel- 
ligence quotients, the low group containing the quarter with the lowest 
intelligence quotients, and the middle group containing the half of the 
children between the two extremes, it is found in Winnetka, Illinois, that 
the difference in median progress of the three groups amounts to only 
about two months’ work per year; whereas the range from the poorest 
child to the best in any one of the groups is from eight to ten times as 
great. The median child of the gifted or high group saves only about a 
month a year, while the median child of the low groups loses only about 
two weeks a year. Yet the slowest child in the gifted group loses two 
weeks a year, while the fastest one gains seven and one half months—that 
is, does almost two years’ work in a year. The range between the slowest 
and fastest children in the middle group and low group is even greater 
than that in the gifted group. The slowest child in the low group, for 
example, does only a little over one third of a grade’s work in a year, while 
the fastest child in the low group does the work of a grade and one half. 
Consequently, the organization of the curriculum to fit children should be 
an organization that permits each child to spend the amount of time he 
needs to master each phase of that curriculum. 
If the curriculum is to be fitted to the individual children rather than 
to ability groups, the following general principles may be laid down: 
1. The knowledge and skills which every child must master shall be 
clearly specified. The knowledge and skills should be those which will be 
used by every child in his life. They should be determined by scientific 
investigations of social needs, not by tradition or committee judgment. 
They will be the common essentials—those facts and skills which are 
essential to all of us in common. 
2. Opportunities for the mastery of these common essentials should be 
given to every child. ‘This inevitably means differing amounts of time for 
differing children. But it also means that all the children get the habit 
of mastery and that all the children master those things which are essential 
for all. 
3. Provision shall be made for the valuable and educative use of the 
varying amounts of surplus time of the more rapid workers. ‘Too often 
plus assignments are given to such children in an effort to occupy their 
time. Such assignments are frequently mere padding. It is not necessary 
that the time a child saves in one subject should be spent in educational 
work on that same subject. It is often wiser to allow him to progress as 
rapidly as his ability will permit untit he has a large enough unit of saved 
time to enable him to undertake some worthwhile project in line with his 
interests or needs.

  THE Tuirp YEARBOOK 23   
Time and Content—Two Factors in Differentation to Meet 
Individual Needs 
The methods of meeting individual needs in children through more 
homogeneous grouping and through individual instruction accept as the 
bases of adjustment the modification of time that children of different 
ability require to complete the course of study together with modification 
in content. Many would agree that both the factors of time and content 
should be modified. Limited pupils, even when given more time, do not 
always grasp the same subject-matter as do gifted children. In curriculum 
construction, we are faced with the fact that all individuals cannot ulti- 
mately learn the same things. 
Differentation of Curricula to Fit Community Needs 
‘The discussion thus far has dealt with education’s material—the indi- 
vidual child. The second general principle of curriculum differentiation 
has to do with the child’s environment. In rural districts the objectives 
of elementary education are not different from those in the city, but the 
means of reaching them and materials available differ from those in large 
centers of population. Some communities are cosmopolitan in their makeup. 
‘They contain within their limits all sorts and types of school environ- 
ments and the superintendent soon: finds that a curriculum which would 
fit one district in his city will not completely fit another district. ‘The 
ultimate purpose of elementary education is the same everywhere, but the 
content and method through which it is achieved varies. 
Major principles for community curriculum differentiation—1. The 
materials of instruction must be approached in terms of the child’s interests 
and experience. ‘The experiences may be pre-school or contemporary with 
his school life. Since the environmental conditions surrounding pupils 
must be made the basis of approach to larger experiences to be developed 
through the curriculum, local course of study committees, the elementary 
school principal, and the individual teacher must be responsible for the 
approach to subject-matter. .This approach will be a means to an end, 
not an end in itself. To illustrate, agriculture and farm life experience 
may be used as the starting point of elementary rural education; they need 
not, and oftentimes should not, be the ultimate goal. 
2. Sheer economy in learning requires that the educational resources 
of local life be used. For example, museums and art galleries are sources 
of art lessons for the city child. Autumn coloring of woods, sunsets, and 
mountains may be the rural art teacher’s approach. The elementary sci- 
ence teacher in the city could profitably have his pupils study gas meters; 
rural children would probably find the Babcock milk tester of more direct 
interest. The important educational resources of the community not pre- 
sented in the curriculum must be organized for instructional purposes so
-P-A-G-E-24
  
24 ¢ DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
as to contribute to the education of the child. Here again local course of 
study committees, the elementary school. principal, and the individual 
teacher must be responsible for the educational use of materials of a local 
nature not found in the general curriculum. 
3. The details, sequence, and emphasis of subject-matter must frequently 
vary with community needs. ‘To illustrate, the manual training teacher 
may discover that pupils in the slum sections of a city will be interested in 
learning to make household repairs. The child from a wealthy home 
would probably have no opportunity to use this knowledge if he acquired 
it. He would be interested, however, in learning to’ make certain toys 
which’ money cannot buy. In the end, both children will have learned the 
same fundamental principles of manual training and the use of the same 
tools. The mere going through a process after it has been learned and 
ceases to have educational value should always be guarded against. 
4. The course of study should not be based on traditions of the past or 
the customs of a community, although both of these should be taken into 
consideration in order that they may be evaluated. We need constantly 
to challenge our educational program if this program is to keep abreast of 
the progress made in social and economic organization. 
5. A survey should be made of every community before planning its 
course of study to determine in so far as possible: (a) Physical boundaries 
and nature of the community; (b) economic interests and relations of 
these interests to social and spiritual values; and (c) social assets and 
liabilities of the community, including such items as communication, trans- 
portation, means of play and recreation, intellectual and spiritual leader- 
ship. 
6. Curricula for both urban and rural communities should be developed 
with specific reference to the ‘“‘lacks” or “needs” of urban or rural life in 
general and to each community in particular. 
7. It is of vital importance that the community know, through parent- 
teachers’ associations, school officials, etc., the reasons underlying the or- 
ganization of the course of study and its relation to the community. Out 
of a free and frank discussion of this phase of the problem will come the 
best suggestions as to: (a) The use of a community as source material for 
the elementary schools; and (b) the ways in which the elementary schools 
may better serve the community. 
The public school must seek constantly to interpret itself to the adult 
community. Unless it does this, its efforts are bound to be hampered. The 
adult public, not school officials, is the court of final authority. Hence the 
public must come into possession of the evidence. 
8. Local school systems within states should be given a certain amount of 
freedom to test new educational theories. 
Progress ‘in education, like progress in social and industrial development, 
comes largely through the ability of individual units to experiment, dif- 
ferentiate, and in various ways modify both the method and the material 
of their curricula. The contributions of Rochester, Gary, Winnetka, and
-P-A-G-E-25
    
Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 25   
countless other schools have come through their opportunity to differentiate 
more or less established curricula. 
9. The outstanding character of a school doing a valuable piece of indi- 
vidual differentiation becomes a challenge first to schools in its immediate 
neighborhood and finally throughout the county, the state, and the nation. 
The purpose, living within a community, must find its initiative or motive 
within itself, not from without. A system superimposed may become an 
attitude, but never assumes sufficient importance to be character. External 
conformity may not mean inner acceptance. 
The Final Test of Differentiation 
‘To summarize, although there is a.general core of subject-matter which 
should prevail throughout the nation in all courses of study for the first 
six grades, each local course of study committee and individual teacher 
must be responsible for the approach to the subject-matter, for the use and 
adaptation of the materials of the curriculum for community needs, for 
organization for instructional purposes of the educational resources of the 
community not presented in the curriculum, and for introducing material 
which will meet the needs peculiar to a given community. 
When these differentiations are wisely planned and carried out, com- 
munity interest and appreciation result from the service which the school 
renders the community. In turn the public gives better support, both 
financial and moral, to the work of the public school, so that the school is 
enabled to render still larger service; in other words, the initiative of the 
individual community is aroused. 
To achieve this, we must have in addition to differentiation of curricula 
to meet the larger community needs, a flexible curriculum in the hands of 
an administrative and teaching force sensitive to the interests and needs 
of individual children; for, after all, the problem of differentiation of 
courses of study is one of constant adaptation of education to the indi- 
vidual.

INTRODUCTION 
RADITION and opinion, unsupported by facts, are no longer suf- 
ficient bases for including any subject or topic in the public school 
curriculum. The material available for instruction is so vast that 
no one person can hope to master more than a small portion of it. How 
is selection to be made? ‘The subjects in the elementary school curriculum 
are those intended for universal study. They must meet the tests of social 
usefulness and individual development, achievement, and happiness. Some 
of the research studies reviewed in this section represent attempts scientif- 
ically to determine what subject-matter is socially useful in present-day: 
life. Others seek to learn what is of greatest interest to children; for, 
other things being equal, material should be taught at the moment when 
the use for it is apparent. Hence, the studies of the interests of children 
are important to curriculum makers. 
It is generally accepted that the traditional curriculum for each subject 
in the elementary school must be modified to satisfy specific objectives and 
definite outcomes formulated in the light of present-day standards. The 
immediate needs of the child, the future demands of his adult life, and his 
capacity for education are all determining factors. 
The drill subjects, where the content is definite, have been dealt with 
more or less completely. For these subjects the minimum essentials in 
functional content should be tentatively determined soon by research 
workers. 
In this section of the Yearbook, the outstanding research studies which 
have been made up to date are reviewed. In some subjects the research 
work which has been done is fragmentary. This largely explains why 
certain subjects are treated so much more completely than others, although 
space allotment in the Yearbook was to some extent a determining factor. 
It was necessary to limit the number of studies reviewed in those sub- 
jects where extensive research has been carried on. 
The methods of attack in these research studies represent a conscientious 
striving for the scientific solution of curricular problems. ‘The technique 
of the investigations in some instances is crude. In the absence of absolute » 
measurement, concensus of expert opinion as well as of mass opinion, has 
been resorted to. Even this procedure, however, gives an approximation 
which is far superior to the personal opinion of a few individuals. 
The findings of some investigations are incomplete. ‘They should serve 
as starting points for further work, not as bases for statements of uni- 
versality of results. These studies are the first forward steps and may be 
more useful as pointing the way rather than as presenting conclusive 
results. Perhaps their greatest service will be to show the vastness of the 
task of bringing the elementary school curriculum up to date and keeping 
it there and to emphasize the need for research to blaze the way for practice » 
and to check results actually obtained.

  32 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
At the beginning of each chapter are listed problems which confront 
course-of-study committees in outlining that subject. In so far as possible 
these questions are answered by a review of scientific studies bearing 
upon ‘them.’ The number of unanswered questions, however, shows that 
at the present time the outstanding need in the field of curriculum construc- 
tion is the making of hundreds of technical studies. 
This section of the Yearbook pools most of the important existing cur- 
ricular studies.’ Here is made available much material of high value which 
hithertofore has: been inaccessible because of its technical form and presenta- 
tion; or because of its fragmentary distribution. ‘The analyses of the studies 
which follow should have these four advantages: 
Many mooted curricular questions are answered ; 
Material is collécted for a later program of evaluation; 
Information is presented that is at least useful in the form of suggestions ; 
Connecting links are furnished between principles ‘and practice. 
The public school’ recognizes as its first aim the development of char- 
acter through fixing right habits of conduct. Such habits are fundamental 
to moral integrity. Preachments of the moral virtues too often miss their 
mark. But when a child in real life over a period of years finds himself 
in a situation in which it is made pleasant to be honest, to codperate ef- 
fectively with his neighbors, to reverence things which should be reverenced, 
progress has been made toward developing his character. 
Research workers and school administrators recognize the importance 
of character development through the curriculum. Progress in this field 
has been more rapid during the past year than ever before. 
School systems in revising their courses of study are shaping their whole 
school programs, so that every subject taught and every school activity 
engaged in make their proper contribution toward the development of 
character. 
The reader will probably note the absence of any report of researches in 
the important subject of character-building. “The members of the Commis- 
sion recognize the paramount importance of this subject, and they are aware 
of much of the splendid work that is being done, both directly and in- 
directly, by both public and private schools toward character-building. In 
many cities, notably, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, 
and Chicago, there are well organized courses in use. In other cities, a 
course in character-building comprises a definite element of the course in 
civics, or citizenship. In practically all schools of the country, principals 
and teachers are consciously and definitely seeking opportunities for the 
development of good moral habits. through all studies, and especially 
through organized play, games, athletics, and through all group activities 
in which pupils participate. Progress in this field has been more conspic- 
uous since the war than at any time in the history of our schools. Un- 
fortunately, we find little that can be classified .as scientific research in this 
field. To quote Professor Edwin D. Starbuck: ‘There are a good many
-P-A-G-E-33
  
‘THE THIRD YEARBOOK 33   
studies that try to be scientific in the matter of character education, but 
they surely have little right to be dignified by the term, research.” The 
Indiana Survey, by Professor Ahearn, is suggestive of what may be, and 
needs to be, done in this field. Several studies are under way. Professor 
May, of Teachers College, and Professor Starbuck are just now engaged 
in making a bibliography of such studies. 
‘The members of the Commission would feel remiss in their duty to the 
children of our schools, if they did not urge all school officials who are en- 
gaged in revising their courses of study to shape their programs so as to 
make definite provision for character-building.

CHAPTER II 
ARITHMETIC 
Guy M. Wilson, Professor of Education, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, 
Chairman 
RITHMETIC is not an end in itself. It is a tool. To meet the 
A demands of social utility, three phases of arithmetic need attention: 
(1) The basic experience which is necessary in order to make 
manipulative work meaningful; (2) the mastery for automatic reproduc- 
tion of the useful number facts; (3) training in application to life and 
business situations. 
The curriculum demands for the above program are so simple that 
there is no reason why it should not yield to complete analysis and scientific 
determination. Much scientific progress has been made. The problems 
needing solution may be listed with reasonable completeness ; on some there 
are much data. ; 
The following is submitted as a representative statement of the prob- 
lems on which further scientific evidence is wanted. 
Major Curriculum Problems in Arithmetic 
1. Specifically, what is the purpose of arithmetic; what is its relation 
to the major objectives of education? 
2. How much emphasis should be placed upon the building up of ex- 
perience before proceeding with the manipulation of symbols? In other 
words, this is the problem of building up experience, so that number work 
shall be meaningful, rich in application, and actually useful instead of 
being merely formal memory work. 
3. When should formal drill work begin and at what rate should it pro- 
ceed? In this connection, there is needed a set of criteria and a means of 
checking, so that drill may not proceed on a meaningless basis. 
4. Is it possible to replace haphazard drill by a scheme of drill that is 
completely systematized, all inclusive, with the elements ranked on the basis 
of difficulty? ‘This complete scheme should lend itself as a means for 
checking or testing the entire range of the child’s ability on fundamental 
drill needs. 
5. What is the proper unit of instruction in arithmetic? 
6. What are the procedures or requirements necessary to place arith- 
metic on a 100 per cent motivated basis? ‘This is a problem of making 
arithmetic grow out of pupil experience and real life situations that are

  8. By what plan or procedure may teachers eliminate merely stock 
examples in so-called reasoning problems, substituting therefore life situa- 
tions worth while in themselves? 
9. What are the reasonable limits of general arithmetic or arithmetic 
needed by the consumer group; where does vocational arithmetic begin; 
and what are the specific needs for arithmetic by the various vocational 
groups? 
10. Is it possible to have an elastic set of norms or standards of per- 
formance that shall include speed, difficulty, and accuracy, and make proper 
allowance for individual differences? 
11. In usable form, what is the specific psychology involved in learning 
and remembering in the various phases of arithmetic work—drill, reasoning, 
and application to life situations? 
12. How much of the failure in lower grade arithmetic may be ac- 
counted for by low ability in reading, and what adjustments in time 
schedule are necessary to make sure that reading ability is adequate to carry 
the necessary work in arithmetic? 
13. How replace the formal textbook procedure by the actual figuring 
used in business? In other words, what is wanted is a method by which 
the children may learn of the actual figuring used in business and be con- 
scious themselves that they are figuring in practically the same form in 
which it is being done by adults. 
14. How should we profitably use the time usually alloted to arithmetic? 
Sixteen and two thirds per cent of all school time for arithmetic, as shown 
by previous studies, is obviously more than is justified. Shall the extra 
time be used as a vehicle, or excuse, for approach to other aims in educa- 
tion: for example, effective home membership through the study of the 
budget, the civic-economic aim through a study of the cost of strikes, etc., 
or shall the time devoted to arithmetic be reduced as made possible and 
desirable by the greater efficiency of present-day teaching and the broader 
view of present educational objectives? 
The Committee’s Plan of Report 
‘The Committee sought to obtain a review of all important studies, pub- 
lished or unpublished, and to organize the findings as answers to definite 
problems. The references in the Judd-Buswell Commonwealth Fund 
bibliography on arithmetic were divided among the Committee for review, 
and the entire country was sectioned for the gathering of unpublished 
studies. Members of the Committee gave such unlimited time and effort, 
that finally, the chief handicap of the Committee is lack of space assign- 
ment to include its full report. 
The report takes up successively the following problems: 
I. When should formal arithmetic begin? (Stone). 
II. What are the socially useful processes? (Woody). 
III. According to what criteria should drill be organized? (Knight).

IV. What is the best procedure for building up ability to handle concrete 
or reasoning problems? (Clark). 
V. What has psychology and experimental education to contribute? 
(Myers and Osburn). : 
VI. What help from standard tests? (Wilson). 
VII. What is the method of curricular determination in arithmetic? 
(Wilson). 
For several reasons these problems will not receive a well-balanced treat- 
ment. The amount of available data varies, and, due to the manner of 
apportioning the work, some problems received much more attention than 
others. The chairman took the liberty of reducing his own work to a 
mere summary in order to make space for the carefully prepared work 
of Woody and Knight. 
I. When Should Formal Arithmetic Begin? 
The term “formal arithmetic,” as here defined, means formal drill work 
and a definite attempt to teach for automatic reproduction the number 
combinations in the fundamental processes, such as simple fractions. Since 
the purpose of drill is to fix by repetition something previously compre- 
hended, it is evident that drill should follow, not precede adequate ex- 
perience and understanding. Moreover, there should be on the part of 
the child before he begins formal repetition a real feeling of need and 
clear vision of use and application—in short, there should be complete 
motivation. The psychology of interest is so well established by scientific 
evidence that this statement should go unchallenged. : 
Obviously, there is a tremendous opportunity for individual differences 
in the date of beginning formal drill. Dr. Washburne at Winnetka, Illi- 
nois, and Miss Ringer at Longbranch, Washington, have shown how to 
adapt a drill technique to differences in interest and capacity. There are 
a few other considerations involved. The relation of reading is evidently 
one consideration. The total profit resulting from work in a lower grade 
is another consideration. Scientific evidence is meager. “Three studies 
which have a bearing follow: 
STUDY NO. 1. Taylor, Joseph S. “Omitting arithmetic in the first 
year,’ Educational Administration and Supervision. February, 1916. 
pp. 87-93. 
This is an experiment conducted in Public School No. 16, the Bronx, 
New York City during 1913 to 1915. During the first of these two years, 
half the entering children in the school did no work in arithmetic except 
counting. The extra time was devoted to reading. At the close of the 
second year of the experiment, children who had had two years of formal 
number work and those who had had but one year—the children being 
otherwise equivalent—were compared by the use of standard tests. A 
summary of the results follows:
-P-A-G-E-38
    38 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
2A Tests Oral Written 
Classes with arithmetic in first year................ 81.0 72.6 
Classes omitting arithmetic in first year............. 87.1 89.4 
2B Tests 
@lasses with! aritlimetic in: first years. i... 2.023103 é 69.5 
  Classes omitting arithmetic in first year... 61.0 
From this summary it is evident that the classes which omitted formal 
number work during the first year of school and gave the extra time to 
reading were, all told, at an advantage by the close of the second year. 
The quality and quantity of reading greatly improved, while the number 
work showed improvement—that is, in the 2A tests the children omitting 
number work in the first year were superior in both oral and written 
work, while in the 2B tests they were superior in the oral and inferior 
in the written. The totals, therefore, appear to favor omitting formal 
number work from the first year and giving the time to reading. This 
is the interpretation placed upon the results by Taylor, the author. 
STUDY NO. 2. Hackler, John Monroe. The relation between suc- 
cessful progress in mathematics and the ability to read and understand, and 
the factors that contribute to success or failure in mathematics. An un- 
published master’s thesis in the library of the University of Chicago, Chi- 
cago, Ill. September, 1921. 
Problem. The main problem, as stated in the title, is to ascertain 
whether ability in mathematics depends on ability to read, at least to a 
certain extent. Apparently, comprehension-ability in silent reading is the 
thing in the author’s mind, since silent reading tests were used. 
Method.. Tests were given in silent reading and intelligence, and 
teachers’ estimates were obtained in mathematics and other subjects and 
correlated with each other. ‘The experiment was conducted with 40 
students in the preparatory department first-year class in mathematics in 
the Northeastern State Normal School, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and with 
the pupils of Grades III to VIII inclusive, of the Tahlequah city schools. 
The class in the preparatory department corresponds roughly to a first- 
year high-school class, but is far more heterogeneous, containing a wide 
range of ages, and for this reason the correlation studies of this group 
are supplemented by an individual analysis. 
Conclusions and Results. The results of this investigation have not 
confirmed the original hypothesis to the extent expected. It has failed 
to show that ability to succeed in mathematics depends to any great extent 
upon reading ability. Results with the preparatory school class showed 
correlations of -+-.36 between the Kansas Silent Reading Test and teach- 
ers’ estimates of ability in first-year mathematics by the “listed pairs” 
method, and -++.60 by the Ranks’ method. In the city schools positive 
correlations of from .22 to .70 were obtained between reading tests and 
teachers’ estimates in arithmetic.

The author states, “Personal investigations and analysis of individual 
cases lead to the belief that reading ability is a factor in successful work 
in mathematics.”

ment in reading 9.1 months 
B. Excess gain in arithmetic comprehen-

V. Conclusion: 
‘The excess gain made in arithmetic comprehension age 
made by the original faulty readers over the original good 
readers was in the main due to their improvement in the 
specific type of reading needed in offsetting the influence 
of isolated drill—namely, ability to follow directions call- 
ing for several processes in mixed order. 
Conclusion. The above studies and data are obviously inconclusive. 
‘They do, however, point to the desirability of more careful attention to 
reading and the entire omission of formal number work from the first grade. 
‘These conclusions are supported by much unscientific evidence from various 
parts of the country, some of which may be briefly recounted. 
Professor Stone reports that the demonstration and practice school in 
the State Normal College of Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1902-1911 began formal 
number work in the third grade, except counting and simple addition and 
subtraction, facts that arose in regular school activities. “Che public schools 
of that city began number work in the first year. Pupils entering the 
training school from the city schools in the fourth year showed a little 
advantage in written work at the beginning of the year, but by the end 
of the second semester there was no difference between those who had had 
number work for three and one half years and those who had had num- 
ber work for only one and one half years. 
Dr. H. L. Smith in the Bloomington (Illinois) Survey shows that chil- 
dren who had had no formal number work in grades one and two were 
not handicapped by the end of the third year in competition with children 
who had had number work regularly during the first and second year. 
II. What are the Socially Useful Processes? 
McMurry, as long ago as 1904, with keen insight, called the attention 
of superintendents to the fact that many processes taught in arithmetic had
-P-A-G-E-41
  Tue THirp YEARBOOK 41   
little or no social value. His opinion was supported again and again, but 
then as now mere opinion carried less weight than scientific evidence. 
Fortunately, a method has been discovered for gathering such scientific 
data. The actual analysis of usage has become the basis for inclusion of 
processes found useful, or the exclusion of processes not used. 
Mrs. Gallaway’s study deals with the needs of freshmen college girls 
who take a course in clothing. Obviously, with the basic arithmetic taught 
and with the evident need at hand, college women will master additional 
arithmetic as needed. ‘The same statement applies to the study of Williams 
dealing with the mathematics needed in freshman chemistry. If chemistry 
calls for more arithmetic, then is the time to teach it. 
‘The other studies divide themselves sharply into two classes, according 
to viewpoint. Adams and Mitchell are dealing chiefly with ability to read 
numbers and understand them in general and not with manipulative ability ; 
on the other hand, the studies by Charters, Hanus, Wilson, Wise, and 
Woody deal with manipulative skills demanded of adults. It should be 
noted that these two viewpoints show radically different results. 
For a century or more after the founding of Yale University, it was 
possible for students to enter without knowing the multiplication table, 
yet there is little doubt that the general reading ability called for in the 
Adams study was met. Doubtless also the multiplication table was 
learned, but the point is that there is no established and verified relationship 
between the general understanding required for reading ability and the 
automatic response required for calculating. The findings from these 
studies point strongly to the following conclusions: (1) That experience 
must in all cases precede formal work in calculating; (2) that manipulative 
or calculating skill required is relatively small and not a matter of momen- 
tary occurrence to even the busiest of adults; and (3) many processes long 
retained in the textbooks in arithmetic have practically zero value. 
It is safe to say that most superintendents of schools today would agree 
to the complete elimination of the following processes: 
Compound numbers, addition, subtrac- 
tion, multiplication, division. 
Greatest common divisor and least com- 
mon multiple beyond the power of 
inspection. 
Long confusing problems in common 
fractions. 
Complex and compound fractions. 
Reductions of denominate numbers. 
Cases two and three in percentage. 
Annual interest. 
Compound interest, except savings. 
Partial payments. 
True discount. Proportion. 
Ratio beyond the ability of fractions to 
satisfy. 
Partnership with time. 
Longitude and time. 
Exchange, domestic and foreign. 
Apothecaries’ weight. 
Troy weight. 
Table of folding paper, surveyor’s table, 
table of foreign money.

zium, polygons, frustrums, spheres.

The curriculum in arithmetic should make no provision for formal drill 
on the above processes. ‘This does not preclude some “informational” 
attention to them, or some special attention whenever one of them is in- 
volved in a “life situation” studied in detail by the pupils. 
A summary by Woody of the scientific evidence follows in order of ap- 
pearance: 
1. Computational uses of arithmetic—The findings on the computa- 
tional uses of arithmetic are so different from those on informational or 
general reading usage that it seems wise to separate the studies. ‘The com- 
putational uses are much simpler, and according to Woody (Study No. 
14), they are being further reduced by the uses of commercial calculating 
machines. By separating the studies into these two divisions they show 
great consistency as to conclusions.

Problem. To get the sentiment and goodwill of the business men of 
Connersville in the construction of the course of study in arithmetic in 
the public schools of that city. 
Method. The following questionnaire was submitted to the business 
men for consideration: 
(1) At present the school time in the grades is divided approximately 
as follows: Reading, 26 per cent; arithmetic, 16 per cent; language, 12 
per cent; history, 11 per cent; geography, 8 per cent; spelling, 7 per cent; 
music, 6 per cent; drawing, 6 per cent; writing, 4 per cent; physiology, 
4 per cent. Does this appeal to you as a proper division of school time in 
the grades? 
(2) Stated differently, English receives 49.2 per cent of the school time 
in the grades; the three R’s receive 65.24 per cent; the fundamentals (the 
three R’s plus geography and history) receive 86.09 per cent; the special 
subjects (physiology, music, and drawing) 13.91 per cent. Does your ex- 
perience suggest any change of emphasis? 
(3) Following are some topics we, as boys, studied in arithmetic in the 
grades. Check (1) the topics for which you have had considerable use 
during the past six months. Cross (X) the topics for which you have 
had little or no use during the six months: 
Troy weight Foreign exchange 
Longitude and time Compound proportion 
The surveyor’s table True discount 
The greatest common divisor Cases 2 and 3 in percentage 
‘The least common multiple Compound interest 
Complex fractions Partial payments 
Cube root Partnership 
Compound fractions 
* The studies are numbered consecutively throughout the chapter for convenience in reference.

  Tue THirD YEARBOOK 43 
  
May some of these topics be omitted from our arithmetic work without 
material loss? Which ones? 
(4) Following are some topics we did not study in arithmetic as boys: 
Saving and loaning money Keeping simple accounts 
Mortgages Investing money 
Modern banking methods Bonds as investments 
Building and loan associations 
Real estate as investments (cheap rentals, good residence property, 
business blocks, farm lands as investments ) 
Marks of a good investment (It is estimated that the get-rich- acs 
concerns fleece the American people out of $60,000,000 a year) 
Taxes, levies, public expenditures 
Profits in different lines of business 
Check (1/) any of the above that appeal to you as worthy of a place 
in present-day arithmetic work. 
(5) Connersville is developing important industrial and commercial 
interests. To what extent should those interests have an influence in shap- 
ing a course of study for our schools, especially in arithmetic? 
(6) Suggest some feasible plan of bringing the schools into closer rela- 
tions with the industrial, commercial, and business interests of our com- 
munity. Give some figures and problems from your own business. 
Findings. 1. On questions (1) and (2) few suggestions were made. 
Of these, most recommended reducing the time given to drawing and 
increasing the time given to writing and spelling. 
2. On question (3) the business men reported which topics had been 
little used and suggested that they be eliminated from the course of study. 
There was meager support for cube root, compound proportion, cases in 
percentage, and the surveyor’s table, and the majority favored eliminating 
these and putting the time on the fundamentals. 
3. On question (4) all agreed that every topic should be included in the 
course of study. 
4. On question (5) all agreed that the schools and the course of study 
should take into consideration the industrial and commercial interests of the 
community. 
5. On question (6) nothing of consequence was submitted.

a ruler to the following groups of students who were told to determine the 
exact area of each figure: 
Group I. One hundred and twenty-three pupils in Grades IX to XII. 
Group II. Thirty-eight pupils in Grade IX who had just spent three 
months in mensuration. 
Group III. Thirty pupils in Grade XI in a technical high school three 
months after they had completed mensuration in connection 
with plane geometry. 
Group IV. Fifteen adult students at Teachers College, Columbia Uni-

Findings. 
In Group I 
Forty-four per cent could not find any of the areas. 
Ninety-three per cent failed on the rhomboid. 
Fifty-five per cent failed on the square. 
In Group II 
Twenty-four per cent could not find any of the areas. 
Ninety-three per cent failed on the rhomboid. 
Thirty-two per cent failed on the square. 
Even in Group IV there was considerable failure. 
Test II. As another test, the following lists of areas and volumes (1) 
area of square, rectangle, triangle, circle, and rhomboid; (2) entire surface 
of a cube, prism, pyramid, cylinder; (3) volume of a cube, prism, cylinder, 
were given to the following groups of people: (a) Pupils in school, (b) 
teachers of drawing, sewing, and manual training, (c) one hundred forty 
men and women engaged in various occupations. These different groups 
were asked to cross out all items in the given list which they had not used 
in their life out of school. 
Findings. Seventy-eight per cent of all the pupils crossed off every- 
thing. Teachers of manual training said that board measure was needed 
to compute cost, but no other areas were needed in this work. ‘Teachers of 
other subjects answered that neither areas nor volumes were needed for

Problem. To find out how the results achieved on the Courtis Research 
Test, Series B, by 446 employees of one of the largest trust companies and 
one of the largest department stores in Boston compared with those achieved 
by the pupils in Grade VIII in the Boston public schools. 
Method. The Courtis tests were given to the employees in groups of 
approximately 35 individuals and the results obtained compared with the 
achievements in Grade VIII in the Boston public schools. 
Findings. 1. In addition, the median number of problems solved by 
the employees was 22.87 per cent; the median accuracy, 88.6 per cent. By 
the pupils in Grade VIII, the median number of problems correctly solved 
was 12.9 per cent; the median accuracy, 77 per cent. Many of the em- 
ployees finished the test before the end of eight minutes. 
2. In subtraction, the median number of exercises solved by the employees 
was 19.3 per cent with a median accuracy of 85.3 per cent correct; by the 
pupils in Grade VIII, 12.9 per cent exercises correct with an accuracy of 
90 per cent. It is interesting to note that the pupils in Grade VIII were 
approximately five per cent more accurate than the employees. 
3. In multiplication, the median number of exercises solved by the 
employees was 13.8 per cent with a median accuracy of 64.8 per cent; the 
median number of exercises correctly solved by the pupils was 11.8 per 
cent with a median accuracy of 82 per cent. Note that the pupils solved 
almost as many problems and were much more accurate.
-P-A-G-E-47
Tue THirp YEARBOOK 47 -   
4. In division, the median number of exercises solved by the employees 
was 11.1 per cent with an accuracy of 84.8 per cent; the median number 
of exercises by the pupils, 12.2 per cent correct with a median accuracy of 
94 per cent. Note that the pupils worked more problems and were more 
accurate. 
5. Analysis of the results showed that the accountants in the department 
store made much higher scores than the salesgirls, and that bookkeepers in 
the bank made higher scores than those in the listing department. It is 
possible that the former groups were more highly selected, but the fact that 
their speed in addition was much greater in proportion than that in other 
operations suggests that the greatest efficiency results from greater practice 
_ rather than selection of higher initial ability. Relatively greater practice 
in multiplication and division on the part of the school children of Boston 
accounts for their higher percentage of accuracy.

Froblem. To determine the nature of the arithmetic used by adults in 
their social and business relations. 
Method. Study based upon the analysis of 14,583 problems contributed 
by 4068 different persons representing 155 different occupations. ‘These 
problems were collected through the codperation of superintendents and 
teachers in the public schools of the east and the middle-west, who asked 
the children in Grades VI, VII, and VIII to get from their parents, each 
night for a period of two weeks, a statement of the uses which they had 
made of arithmetic during the day. The statements of the problems 
encountered, thus collected, provided the data upon which this study was 
based. The author contended that the data were extensive and varied 
enough to be representative of adult social and business life. 
Findings. 1. Eighty-five per cent of all problems involved the use of 
money in either the buying or selling of goods. Labor and wages, interest, 
rent, and insurance covered two thirds of the problems involving money, 
but not involving buying or selling. Problems not involving money 
involved hours of labor, measurement of capacity of bins, cisterns, cribs, 
tanks, estimates of building materials, etc. 
2. Of all the problems involving buying and selling, 45.9 per cent related 
to food; 17.9 per cent to clothing. For all occupations the ten topics 
involved the greatest number of times in the different problems were: 
groceries, dry goods, labor, milk, making change, meat, eggs, clothing, 
butter, and fuel. 
3. Multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and fractions reported 
constituted 90.6 per cent of all the problems. Little use was made of pro-

portion, decimals, apothecaries’ weight, square root, partial payments, and 
troy weight. When these topics were involved the problems were too 
complicated for the elementary grades. 
4. In the problems involving addition only two and one half. per cent bof 
the problems had more than four places in the largest addend. Almost all 
of the multiplication problems had either one or two place numbers in the 
multiplier. In division 39.6 per cent of all the problems had one number 
in the divisor ; 43.4 per cent had two-place numbers in the divisor. 
5. The most commonly used fractions had denominators of halves, thirds, 
fourths, fifths, and eighths. 
6. The following processes did not appear in the adult figuring reported: 
' greatest common divisor, least common multiple, long confusing problems 
in common fractions, complex and compound fractions, reduction in 
denominate numbers, tables of folding paper, surveyor’s measure, foreign 
money, compound numbers, longitude and time, compound interest, annual 
interest, exchange, true discount, partnership with time, ratio, mensuration 
involving trapezoids, trapeziums, polygons, frustrums, spheres, cube roots, 
or the metric system.

course of study in arithmetic.” Seventeenth Yearbook of the National 
Society for the Study of Education, Part I. Bloomington, Ill., Public 
School Pub. Co., 1918. pp. 7-17. 
Problem. To determine the relative importance of the various content 
elements of the course of study in arithmetic through ascertaining the 
frequency of their occurrence and the manner of their use. 
Method. Study based upon the arithmetic appearing in a standard cook 
book, in the payrolls of a number of artificial flower and feather factories, 
in marked-down sales advertisements, and in a general hardware catalogue. 
Findings. 
Study I—From the cook book: 
(1) The numbers occurring were very small regardless of 
whether they were integers or mixed numbers. 
(2) The most commonly occurring fractions had denomi- 
nators of 2, 3, 4, and 8. 
Study Il—From the factory payrolls: 
(1) The word “dozen” and fractional parts of twelve were 
used very much. The commodities were made and sold 
by the dozen. 
(2) To compute earnings the arithmetical processes in- 
volved: addition of all possible fractions with 12 as a 
dozens; of decimals in terms of dollars and cents; 
cation by a fractional, integral, or mixed number of 
e, denominator to integers and mixed numbers; multipli- 
addition of United States money.
-P-A-G-E-49
  ‘THe THIRD YEARBOOK 49   
(3) The fractions emphasized were twelfths, fourths, 
thirds, and sixths. 
Study I1]—From marked-down sales advertisements: 
(1) Discount notes with the exception of halves and thirds 
were expressed in percentages. 
(2) The most common practices were to use 10 per cent, 
20 per cent, 25 per cent, one third, and one half off. 
Study IV—From the general hardware catalogue: 
(1) Many articles were sold by the dozen, thus necessitat- 
ing ability to calculate using fractions and mixed num- 
bers involving 12 as the denominator of the fraction. 
(2). Fractions with denominators of 16, 32, and 64 were 
used. Many of these fractions were merely descriptive, 
although the dealer had to read and understand them. 
(3) Quantities tabulated under avoirdupois weight were 
descriptive of the weights of articles, but addition of 
weights was necessary in determining freight rates. 
(4) The terms used frequently were: inches, feet, yards, 
ounces, pounds, dozen, gross, quarts. 
(5) The units often used in selling were: per each article, 
per dozen, per gross, per hundred, per pound, per foot, 
per hundred feet, per square foot, per hundred square 
feet.

Problem. To test over a more varied area, the Wilson Survey method 
of determining the social needs for the arithmetical processes. 
Method. The problems of adults, 7345 in number, were gathered from 
the States of Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, California, and Missouri. 
The classification used showed the processes and their difficulty. 
Findings. 1. Differences in the classifications of problems from the city 
and rural districts and also differences in the classifications of problems from 
different parts of the country were negligible. 
2. Eighty-five per cent of all problems classified involved only the four 
fundamental operations, or combination of fundamental operations. 
3. The fractions commonly used were 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/5, and 
1/8. These constituted 93.9 per cent of all fractions which occurred. 
4. Problems involving common weights and measures occurred very 
frequently. 
5. There were very few problems in compound interest compound 
proportion, insurance, plastering, painting, masonry, and bank discount. _

Journal of Educational Psychology, Volume 10, November, 1919. pp. 
462-467. 
Problem. 1. What arithmetical knowledge and power should be ac- 
quired by a child at the end of Grade VI. 
2. What should be the content of the arithmetic course in Grades IV, 
V, and VI? 
Method. The author went to 12 classes of Grades IV, V, and VI, and 
two immature classes of Grade VII in a choice residential section of Boston 
and asked the children to tell what numbers they make use of or notice 
outside of school. Items reported were accredited to the lowest grade 
mentioned. 
Summary: 
A. Games: (1) Calling or reading numbers: (a) Football signals; (b) 
spots on dice; (c) spots on dominoes; (d) number on sled to indicate size; 
(2) Counting marbles, children in games, tops, stripes, etc. 
B. Going to store: (1) Knowledge of quantity (pound), (2) number 
of articles, (3) finding cost, and (4) counting change. 
C. Other instances of reading numbers: (1) Telephone numbers, (2) 
automobile numbers, (3) policeman numbers, (4) numbers on fire see 
(5) numbers on police engine, (6) dates on almanac. 
D. Other instances of counting: (1) Money belonging to child, (2) 
.postage stamps, (3) steps in dancing, (4) number of Christmas presents. 
Conclusion. Reading of numbers and counting include nearly every 
item recorded above. Below Grade VII there is no felt need for problems 
in arithmetic. “These emphasize mechanical work up to the sixth grade. 
Then is the time for applied arithmetic. Before Grade VI, emphasize the 
four processes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), common 
fractions, and decimals.

No. 7, March, 1922. pp. 505-521. 
Problem. The investigation was undertaken to gain a reliable index of 
arithmetic needed by the clerk in selling goods and by the consuming public 
in purchasing goods. 
Method. The study consists of an analysis of 4661 bills of sale, represent- 
ing a total value of $41,560.67 obtained from three large stores in Seattle, 
a wholesale and retail hardware, a wholesale and retail grocery, and a
-P-A-G-E-51

large department store. In this study a problem was defined as any situa- 
tion demanding calculation. Oftentimes one situation demanding more 
than one set of calculations was listed as more than one problem. As the 
author collected data, he interviewed managers concerning needs for 
arithmetic and concerning the arithmetic used. 
Findings. 1. Nine hundred forty-five of the 4661 bills of sale required 
no computation other than in the payment of bills. (‘This was true with 
regard to the vast majority of the business conducted in one of the firms, 
as bills of sale were made only in case the purchases were to be delivered.) 
2. There was no use of decimals save in connection with United States 
money. ‘This was to be expected since calculations involved only buying 
and selling. 
3. Of the problems in addition encountered none had more than five 
places in any addend, and few had more than six addends. The most com- 
mon type of problem in addition consisted of adding two three-place 
numbers. 
4. Few problems in subtraction, other than making change, were en- 
countered. In the grocery only one of the 206 bills of sale involved any 
subtraction, other than making change. When subtraction was involved, 
usually the problems had but three or four numbers in the minuend. 
5. In multiplication, the vast majority of the problems had but two or 
three-place numbers in the multiplicand and one or two-place numbers in 
the multiplier. 
6. By far, the most common problems in division had two or three-place 
numbers in either the dividend or the divisor. Division as a process was 
used less than addition or multiplication. 
7. The most commonly used fractions had denominators of 2, 4, 6, and 
12, although 3, 5, 9, 10, 16, 24, and 144 were used to some extent. The 
most common unit of sale determined very largely the fractions used. 
Dozen or gross were often employed and thus the fractions with denomi- 
nators of 12 and 144 were used. Such fractions were rarely reduced to 
lowest terms. ‘There was much multiplication of a two, three or four- 
place number by a simple fraction, or by a mixed number having one, two, 
or three places and a fraction. There was little use of addition, subtraction 
and division of fractions. 
8. Denominate numbers were encountered as units of sale, but no reduc- 
tion into larger or smaller units took place. 
9. Discount was widely used, especially in the hardware store. The 
most common rates of discount were 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 50 per 
cent. Inquiry revealed that discount tables were used and that little calcula- 
tion was employed. 
10. Interviews with the managers of these stores to supplement the 
analysis of the bills of sale revealed the following significant points: (a) 
The goods were marked in terms of the decimal system to make calculations 
easy; (b) Goods were sold by convenient units or groups of units, and were 
not usually sold by using a simple unit or a multiple of the total cost of a  
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 . DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
large amount of goods; (c) Measuring devices, weighing devices, calcu- 
lating machines, calculating devices, such as discount books, price tables, 
cash registers, central cashiers, etc., have reduced the amount of arithmetic 
used by clerks to a minimum. Oftentimes the manipulating of a mechani- 
cal device and reading numbers was all the arithmetic needed by the clerks 
in selling goods. If there was no central cashier, in addition to the ability 
to read numbers, the clerks had to be able to make change. 
11. While the evidence indicated that the clerks under consideration 
made little use of arithmetic, the author argued that the consuming public 
needed arithmetic for its own satisfaction in checking the accuracy with 
which the calculating and measuring devices were manipulated. He argued 
for much emphasis on mental arithmetic—that is, calculating without pencil 
or paper, and for much emphasis on quickly estimating or approximating a 
correct answer to the problem involved. 
STUDY NO. 13. Woody, Clifford. Results obtained from giving the 
Courtis arithmetic test to members of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs. 
Unpublished study on file in the office of the Bureau of Educational Refer- 
ence and Research, University of Michigan. 
Problem. To determine the level of efficiency in addition and multiplica- 
tion existing in highly selected groups of our adult society and to make 
comparison with the level of efficiency attained by the children in Grade 
VIII. 
Method. The addition and multiplication tests of the Courtis Research 
Tests in Arithmetic, Series B, were given to 203 adults belonging to Rotary 
and Kiwanis Clubs in seven different cities of Michigan. ‘The results 
achieved were compared with the Courtis Standards of Achievement for 
the children of Grade VIII. 
Findings. 1. In general, the members of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs 
attempted more exercises than the children in Grade VIII. The median 
number of problems attempted by the members of the clubs was 19.5 in 
addition and 13.7 in multiplication; the general standard of achievement 
for the children in Grade VIII is 11.6 in addition, and 10.2 in multiplica- 
tion. 
2. There was much yariation in the median number of exercises attempted 
by the various clubs. In addition, the median scores ranged from 13.0 to 
24.1 exercises attempted; in multiplication, from 8 to 16.5 exercises 
attempted. Z 
3. In general, the members of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs were more 
accurate in addition and less accurate in multiplication than the children 
in Grade VIII as indicated by the Courtis general standards. The median 
percentage of accuracy for the 203 members in addition was 82 per cent cor- 
rect; in multiplication, 71 per cent correct. The corresponding figures for 
the general standards of the Courtis Tests in Grade VIII are 76 and 81 per 
cent, respectively. The variation of the median percentages of accuracy in
-P-A-G-E-53
       Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 53 
    
T 
addition among the different clubs was from 71 per cent to 86.5 per cent 
correct; in multiplication, from 64.6 per cent to 79.6 per cent correct. It 
is interesting that the median percentage of accuracy in multiplication in 
each club was less than the general standard for Grade VIII. 
4. In general, the median percentage of accuracy in the clubs was higher 
in addition and lower in multiplication than in Grade VIII. 
Note. This study suggests that the level of efficiency existing in these 
processes is largely conditioned by the social demands made upon the differ- 
ent individuals. Although the different investigations indicate that multipli- 
cation as a process is used in business and social life more than addition, it 
is ventured that the problems in addition in the Courtis Tests approximate 
the type of problems solved in business and social life more closely than the 
problems in multiplication do. Furthermore, much practice in addition is 
gained in exercises in which the predominant process is multiplication. Thus 
it seems safe to suggest that the club members achieved relatively higher 
scores in addition than in multiplication because relatively greater practice 
of the type measured by the test in addition is encountered in the routine 
of everyday business life. 
STUDY NO. 14. Woody, Clifford. The use of calculating and meas- 
uring devices in business and their influence on the use of arithmetic. Un- 
published study made in coéperation with Leander Beach, 1923. On file 
in the office of the Bureau of Educational Reference and Research, Uni- 
versity of Michigan. 
Problem. To find out to what extent calculating and measuring devices 
were used in business houses and to determine something of the nature of 
arithmetic utilized in carrying on business transactions. 
Method. The managers of 40 business houses in Ann Arbor were per- 
sonally interviewed concerning the use of mechanical devices, short-cut 
methods, and the nature of arithmetic utilized by salesmen and consumers. 
‘This list of business houses included: three banks, five drug stores, six 
grocery stores, four drygoods stores, three bakeries and restaurants, two 
hardware stores, two shoe stores, three men’s clothing stores, two book 
stores, one electric shop, one wall-paper and paint store, one jewelry store, 
one office outfitting store, one five-and-ten cent store, one news company, one 
tea and coffee house, one meat market, one candy store, and one phonograph 
store. The same questions were asked each firm in accordance with a 
specially prepared questionnaire. 
Findings. 1. Each of the business houses made much use of mechanical 
calculating devices. Each firm had at least one cash register, and some had 
as many as 10. Almost all firms had at least one adding machine, and the 
banks had from six to eight machines. ‘The banks used bookkeeping 
machines. Computing scales were used in all grocery stores, all meat 
markets, all drug stores, and in all candy shops. In one grocery store two 
cheese cutters were operated on the computing plan.    
  
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
2.. Many tabular devices were utilized in order to reduce the amount of 
tabulation. The banks used bond and interest tables. ‘The news company 
cused a “price” table to tell the price of the different magazines or combina- 
tions of magazines. The drug stores used. ‘‘percentage solution’’ tables 
whereby it was possible to find the different amounts of a chemical to make 
a solution of a particular strength. The hardware had “screen” tables for 
finding the areas of screens of different lengths and widths, and discount 
tables for determining the cost price from the list price in wholesale cata- 
logues. The book stores used a “printer’s” table for determining the num- 
ber of sheets per pound according to the quality. In fact, almost every firm 
used tabular devices of some kind. 
3. Several “short-cut”? methods were discovered. In computing interest 
at six per cent when the interest book is not used, point off two places in 
the principal and multiply by half the number of months. In figuring the 
selling price on an article when there is a discount, the method is to subtract 
the discount from 100, point off two places in the remainder and multiply 
by the original price. A system of alligations was used by the druggists. 
4. The goods were always marked to avoid complicated calculations. 
Firms are now avoiding marking in fractions and employ the unit of decimal 
system to a great extent. They also avoid the sliding scales and sell at so 
much per unit or multiple of this unit, or group of units. An illustration 
of the unit or group of units plan is: selling six bars of soap for 25 cents 
but charging 35 cents for eight bars. 
5.. Many. of the managers insisted that neither their employees nor the 
purchasers did much actual calculation. In certain stores like restaurants, 
and ice cream stores where articles were sold in combinations the clerks 
learned the sale price for the combination of articles: for example, they 
learned the regular price for a sandwich, coffee, and a piece of pie was 45 
cents and did not have to add the price of the different items to get the 
total. The managers estimated that only about 29 per cent of the buyers 
ever add the cost of different articles purchased to find the total amount 
purchased, and that only about 66.6 per cent of their customers ever check 
the change given them. 
6. These business men insisted that the school needs to emphasize the 
four fundamentals. They felt there is great need for “mental” arithmetic. 
Some emphasized the need for training involving interest, discount, and the 
metric system. ‘The particular needs emphasized by the business men de- 
pended largely on their type of business. 
7. The business men agreed that the greatest number of mistakes made 
in the buyer’s: calculations involve making change. The buyer does not 
understand the “make-change” method and gets lost. 
8. The outstanding conclusion drawn from this investigation is that 
little calculation in arithmetic was actually done.

for salespeople. 
Method. Study consisted of analyzing the arithmetic involved in the 
use of several thousand sales checks. In addition, multiplication and. divi- 
sion 7337 charge checks were examined; in subtraction 4304 cash checks 
were analyzed. ‘The analyses consisted of detailed accounts of the number 
of addends, the number of figures in the addends, the number of figures in 
the minuend when subtraction was involved, the number of times a. par- 
ticular amount of money was offered in payment for a bill of goods, the 
number of places in the multiplicand and multiplier when multiplication 
was involved, the number of places in the dividend and divisor when divi- 
sion was involved, the size of the fractions encountered, etc. 
Findings. The reader is referred to Charter’s book for a detailed sum- 
mary, but the main points are set forth in the paragraph quoted: “In this 
one vocation of department-store selling the chances are nine out of ten 
that no problem in addition will be more complicated than the addition of 
four-place addends; no subtraction is used in making change, and if it were, 
only forty-five out of one hundred subtraction facts would be used; the 
chances are ninety-seven out of one hundred that in multiplication the 
multiplier will be 12 or less and the multiplicand three places or less; in 
fractions, only eleven denominators are found, all being under 10 except 10, 
12, and 16, and by a simple device of using the thumb decimals disappear.”

At the beginning of this chapter, three studies for the purpose of ascertain- 
ing the minimum essentials of arithmetic were reported. 
Study I. Froblem. To find out how much arithmetic is used in everyday 
life. 
Method. A questionnaire was sent to men of various vocations asking 
them certain questions concerning their use of arithmetic. Typical ques- 
tions follow: Do you personally have occasion to add columns of 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, or more figures in width? Do you personally have occasion to compute 
simple interest, etc. 
Findings. From the 799 replies to the questionnaire, it was evident that 
the minimum essentials should include: (1) Addition—five addends, five 
figures in width; (2) multiplication—the multiplicand, five figures in 
width, the multiplier, four figures in width; (3) division—the dividend, 
five figures in width, the devisor, four figures in width; (4) fractions— 
halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, eighths, with tenths; (5) decimals of three 
places; (6) simple interest; and (7) percentage.

Study II. Problem. To find the amount of arithmetic used in everyday 
life with regard to subject-matter. 
Method. A second questionnaire, listing various topics in arithmetic, 
such as addition of fractions, subtraction of fractions, simple cash accounts, 
drawing to scale, etc., was sent to the persons mentioned above with the 
request that they relate to the children in the home all the uses made of 
arithmetic each day for ten consecutive days and have the children record 
such uses by placing an X on the question blank after the enumerated topic. 
Findings. On the basis of the 314 replies to this questionnaire, it was 
concluded that the following should be included in the list of minimum 
essentials: (1) Simple cash accounts, or family expense accounts; (2) cash, 
checks, or bills; (3) addition of fractions; (4) multiplication of fractions; 
(5) subtraction of fractions; (6) banking; and (7) division of fractions. 
Study III. Problem. To find out the amount of arithmetic needed by 
the employees in fifty business firms of Los Angeles. 
Method. The following questionnaire was sent to fifty leading busi- 
ness firms in that city: (1) How much arithmetic should young people 
know when they enter your employment? (2) In what arithmetic work 
do you find them weak or unsatisfactory? (3) What suggestions do you 
make that may assist in correcting mistakes? (4) So far as it comes to 
your attention, what work in arithmetic is being taught that is of little or 
no value in your business? 
Findings. From the 24 replies received, the following answers were 
obtained: (1) The arithmetic needed on entering the firms should include 
addition, multiplication, division, decimals, subtraction, percentage, and 
fractions; (2) The weaknesses manifested were in accuracy (mentioned by 
18 of the 24 replying), decimals, addition, multiplication, fractions; (3) 
The suggestions made for correcting the mistakes were: accuracy, short- 
cuts, mental arithmetic, and “teach the why’; and (4) In response to what 
should be eliminated, the replies were: no topics, higher mathematics, 
algebra, all except the four fundamentals, decimals, interest, and discount. 
Although the above questionnaires are suggestive, the nature of some of 
the answers given suggest that they should not be taken too seriously, for 
they do not smack of serious thought. It may be noted that Study II, 
based upon actual usage instead of opinion, shows a much simpler demand. 
Tabulation of usage is now conceded to be the most effective procedure in 
checking needs.

2. How many sales are totaled in each column of sales on the cards?
-P-A-G-E-57
Tue THIRD YEARBOOK sy   
3. What is the size of the final sum as measured in terms of the number 
of digits involved? 
4. How many columns of sales are added by the salesperson? 
Method. 1324 tally cards, the cards on which sales are entered for pur- 
poses of record, from four large downtown stores, a bookstore, a music 
store, a department store, and one selling athletic goods, besides one fairly 
large drygoods store on the west side of the city, were used. The frequencies 
of occurrence of the four characteristics listed above were tabulated. The 
findings are recorded in tabular and graphic form. 
Findings. 1. Twelve per cent of the total number of cards fall in the 
group having one or two sales. The curve falls rather regularly from this 
point to two and one per cent toward the latter end, where it rises again to 
six per cent for those having fifty or more sales. 
2. The number of sales totaled in the various columns was determined 
partially by the type of card used, depending upon whether the fifty possible 
items were arranged in four, three, or two columns. ‘Thirteen-item columns 
ranked first with fifteen per cent, 12 and 2—item columns second, with 
eleven per cent each. The preponderance of 2-item columns was due in 
part to the number of additions of sub-totals into final totals. 
3. The number of digits involved in the final totals ran in the following 
order: four digits, 73 per cent; three digits, 17 per cent; five digits, 10 per 
cent. Single entry cards were excluded from this tabulation. 
4. The number of columns added varied first, with the type of card 
used; second, in actual count, the one column leading with 44 per cent; 
two columns having 27 per cent, three columns 10 per cent, and four 
columns 9 per cent. 
With the exception of the tally cards from the bookstore, the sales con- 
sidered are the records of cash sales only and therefore do not represent all 
the sales made by these salespersons for a single day. 
2. General informational or reading uses of arithmetic—The arithmetic 
needed by any individual for actual computation is obviously limited, and 
actual computational practice is being further curtailed by the rapid intro- 
duction of calculating machines. But the same limitations do not apply to 
number concepts in general and the ability to interpret the number concepts 
met with in general reading. ‘The suggestion naturally follows that in 
many phases of arithmetic, manipulation should be omitted and the time 
devoted to informational concepts and the general understanding of busi- 
ness situations. In time, we may have some phases of arithmetic dealt with 
in an arithmetic reader with little or no figuring required.

Method. An analysis was made of 35 replies to a questionnaire sent to 
bank employees in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and Texas, relative to the facts in bank- 
ing that all people in a community should know. A similar analysis was 
made of the replies sent in by parents of the pupils in the elementary school 
of the University of Iowa. The instructions were to mark important items 
“XX”, less important items ““X”, and to cross out those of no importance. 
The items reported in the replies were arranged according to their im- 
portance as determined by the bank employers and comparison made with 
their importance as determined by the parents. The results are reported 
under the findings. 
Findings. The bank employees determined the following rankings on 
twenty of the fifty-five items, the most important being placed first: 
(1) How to write a check, (2) how and why to fill out a stub, (3) when 
a check should be cashed, (4) how to stop payment on a check, (5) how 
to sign your name when indorsing a check, (6) what to do if a check is 
lost, (7) how sto indorse a note, (8) how to write a negotiable note, 
(9) how to indorse a check in full, (10) how to use a bank book, (11) 
how to make a deposit slip, (12) how to find interest, (13) importance 
and purpose of savings banks, (14) importance and purpose of commercial 
deposit banks, (15) how to use a promissory note, (16) responsibility of 
maker if note ‘is lost, (17) certified checks, (18) how to open an account, 
(19) when notes are void, and (20) legal rate of interest. 
Parents of the children in the elementary school placed 15 of the 20 
items named above in their list of the 20 most important items, although 
the order selected was not quite the same.

cessfully a course in freshman chemistry in which the textbook was Noyes, 
A Textbook in Chemistry. 
Method. Study consisted of analyzing both the expository body and 
the problems of the text, and recording all words or expressions which 
were distinctly mathematical or implied mathematics and the nature of 
the different operations involved. All exercises were worked out by the 
simplest methods, and both the operations and the quantities were tab- 
ulated. 
Findings. See the original article or the account in Charter’s Curric- 
ulum Construction for detailed summary. 1. In the body of the text, 124 
mathematical concepts were used 1156 times, of which per cent and volume 
comprised nearly one half.

2. Seventy-three different denominate numbers were used, the most 
common of which were: degree, gross, and liter. 
3. Fifty-five different fractions were used, but the derfominators in all 
but 43 of the fractions were less than 10. Of these 43 denominators, eight 
denominators were less than 100, but 24 ended in hundreds or thousands. 
4, Complicated decimals were very frequent. The one-place, two-place, 
and three-place were most frequent, but one decimal had eight: places. 
There were usually two integers and one or two places, but at times the 
decimals were more complicated. Oftentimes decimals were mixed with 
fractions. 
5. Chemical equations occurred very often. “There were nine cases of 
substitution in formule and seventy-seven cases of ratio and proportion. 
6. The arithmetic at times was complicated. In addition there were 
problems consisting of adding an integer and three decimals, two integers 
and three decimals, and three decimals. In subtraction the most difficult 
problem was taking a six-place decimal from another. In multiplication 
at times it was necessary to multiply a four-place number by a six-place 
number. Mixed decimals had to be multiplied together. Complicated 
decimals at times had to be divided by one another. Thus the arithmetic 
needed in chemistry was complicated, but the algebra simple.

fully a freshman college course in clothing in which the text used is Baldt’s 
Clothes for Women. 
Method. Study consisted of analyzing both the expository body and 
the problem of the text, and recording all words or expressions which were 
distinctly mathematical or which implied mathematics, and listing the 
nature of the different operations involved. All of the exercises were 
worked out by the simplest methods, and both the operations and the 
quantities were tabulated. 
Findings. See the account in Charter’s, Curriculum Construction for a 
detailed summary. 
1. It is necessary to understand 111 mathematical concepts correctly to 
read this text intelligently. Of these, 43 were geometrical terms, chiefly 
included in mensuration. All other terms were arithmetical. Chief among 
these terms were: line, equal, center, measure, width, length, and point. 
2. Denominate numbers such as appear in the ordinary arithmetic oc- 
curred and in addition, the two units of measure head and skein. The 
most common units of measure were: inch, dollar, yard, head, and year.

3. The most common fractions used were: halves, quarters, sixths, 
eighths, tenths, twelfths, and sixteenths. ‘There were a few cases of decimal 
fractions. 
4. The integers occurring were mostly one-place integers if expressed 
in words instead of figures. If the integers were expressed in figures, the 
majority of them had less than four figures and none of them had as many 
as five figures. 
5. Roman numerals were used considerably, although none of them had 
more than two places. 
6. In the chapters on drafting and the use of patterns much use was 
made of algebraic equations: for example, “A. E. equals one-sixth neck 
measure plus three-eighths inch.” The solution of similar problems in- 
volved: (a) Translating the algebraic equation expressed in words into a 
symbolic numerical equation, (b) multiplying a whole or mixed number 
by a fraction, (c) subtracting a whole or a mixed number from a whole or 
mixed number, (d) adding a fraction to a whole or mixed number, (e) 
finding a fraction of a fraction, (f) reducing a mixed number to an im- 
proper traction, (g) reducing an improper fraction to a whole or mixed 
number, (h) reducing yards to inches, (i) drawing a line of a given length, 
(j) reducing inches to yards, (k) division of whole numbers, mixed num- 
bers, or fractions, (1) drawing a line parallel to a given line, (m) draw- 
ing a line perpendicular to a given line, (n) drawing a circle or the arc of 
a circle, having given the center and radius, and (0) reading geometrical 
figures by means of letters representing points.

Problem. To determine the type of arithmetic used by 500 first-grade 
pupils in the Detroit public schools in their out-of-school life. 
Method. The data were obtained by having 100 regular room teachers 
interview five selected children each morning for 25 consecutive days con- 
cerning their out-of-school activities and record facts concerning the arith- 
metic used in connection with these activities. The interviews during the 
first week were for the purpose of familiarizing the teachers and pupils 
with the technique of the investigation and were not in the data under 
consideration. In the investigation each teacher itemized daily for each 
pupil the content of the situation in which arithmetic was used, the num- 
bers involved, the operations involved, whether the operation was per- 
formed by the child or not, the classification of the activity according to 
types. and the number of times the particular type of activity was used. 
Much use was made of code numbers as aids in tabulating the data.

Digest, the Modern Priscilla, McCall's, and the National Geographic 
Magazine. 
Findings. 1. Dates were numerous, oftentimes giving the year, the 
month, the day, the hour, and the minute. 
2. There were found 3378 street addresses in all sorts of combinations, 
e.g., 1918 Broadway, Department 909; and 4711 North Clark Street. 
3. A total of 1713 telephone numbers were discovered. They were 
expressed in a great variety of ways. 
4. Numbers varied from such expressions as “50 words” to “255,000,000 
packages of breakfast food.” In all there were 21,619 such expressions. 
Most of them had two-place numbers, but many had nine or more places. 
5. Roman numerals occurred 148 times. They were used most frequently 
to designate the volumes of papers or books, chapters of books, or sections 
of books. Most of the Roman numerals were below a hundred. 
6. References to United States money varied from one cent to $100,000,- 
000,000. However, most of the amounts were less than $100. Reference 
to foreign money contained the following terms: German marks, Italian 
lire, Japanese yen, Indian rupees, English pounds, English three-pence, 
English guineas, and English half-crown. 
7. Only six fractions out of 3000 had a denominator larger than 16. 
The largest denominator was 10,000,000. 
8. Decimals without the use of United States money occurred frequently. 
‘The smallest decimal without the use of United States money was .000,012, 
and the largest one was .97. Most decimals had less than four places. 
9. A great variety of percentages were found, e.g., 114, 134, 2, 234, 3, 
33-1/3, 99-44/100, 177, 700, 1,000, and 1,300. 
10. Simple ratios were found in a variety of ways, e.g., 30 to 1, 1 in 
1,000,000,000, a 5-3-3 ratio, fifty-fifty, etc. 
11. Almost every conceivable unit of measure was used. ‘The different 
units usually found in the following tables of measure were used: dry 
measure, liquid measure, linear measure, square measure, avoirdupois meas- 
ure, measure of time, measure for electricity, and various miscellaneous 
measures as degree, calorie, volt, cord, dozen, teaspoon, tablespoon, etc. 
12. Few graphs were used. 
13. There were numerous mathematical terms or expressions used as: 
cedar chest 40 x 18 x 18, 40 per cent surtax, 90 miles-an-hour-gale, a 12 
horse-power engine, etc. 
14. No arithmetic problems of the textbook type occurred, although 
mathematical materials were presented so as to enable the reader to solve 
almost any problem which might occur to him concerning the situation 
described. 
15. There was virtually no reference to algebra, geometry, and trigo- 
nometry in the magazines analyzed.

III. According to What Criteria Should Drill be Organized? 
‘The committee has not succeeded in getting a summary of studies bear- 
ing upon this point. Kirby, Practice in the Case of School Children, Teach- 
ers College, Columbia University, 1913, showed the large values resulting 
from systematic drill. 
Thorndike has given data bearing upon the same point. The trend of 
evidence is that in the intermediate grades, when drill is confined to 
processes that are useful and well understood, regular time spent upon 
systematic drill gives returns unequalled by any other type of procedure. 
The findings are in favor of systematic drill rather than incidental drill. 
Another finding, on which the evidence is not so satisfactory as one 
could wish, is that attempts to do number work in the lowest grades, par- 
ticularly in grades one and two where the processes are so frequently not 
comprehended by the children, results in the development of errors which 
become a strong handicap in later work. ‘This will be noted more fully 
under Section IV of this report. 
The chief contribution under this section is a definite and complete plan 
worked out by F. B. Knight for organizing the drill work of the fifth and 
sixth grades. The summary of this report is presented first for the con- 
venience of the reader. Dr. Knight has shown, in a masterful way, and 
much more thoroughly than present space permits to be shown, the surpris- 
ing inefficiency and haphazard procedure which exists in drill work; the 
possibility of formulating drill to meet definite specifications; and the 
necessity of systematic drill if automatic memory results are to be had and 
permanently maintained. 
Summary of Report on Organization of Drill 
Introduction: Two uses of drill: 1. Drill as a teaching instrument; 
2. Drill to maintain skills after instruction is passed. The following is a 
list of processes to be drilled under Use 2, with suggested times at which 
drill on each process should begin. 
DRILL ORGANIZATION FOR MAINTAINING ACQUIRED SKILLS 
Specification I. Drill should be on the entire process. 
(a) Various forms or types 
(b) Frequency of each number combination in drill 
(c) Location of number combinations in all positions 
(d) Computation difficulties present 
(e) Illustrations from texts on appearance of unit skills in fraction drills 
(£) Comment on the distribution of practice among the several unit skills in- 
volved in the division of fractions 
(g) Drills can be built to specifications 
Specification II. Drill should come frequently in small amounts. 
(a) Distribution of time for drill on a single process 
(b) Two opposing theories of time distribution 
(c) The cold storage theory and its weaknesses 
(d) Illustrations from texts on time distribution of drill on division of fractions 
(e) Comments on the illustrations of fraction drill

(d) Examples in each process to contain calculated practice 
(e) Advantages of the mixed fundamental type of drill 
Specification IV. Drills should have time limits. 
(a) Speed a secondary consideration 
(b) Wrong types of time standards 
(c) Correct use of time standards involves product measures 
Specification V. Drills should have accuracy standards. 
(a) The shortcomings of the 100 per cent accuracy standard for a list of ex- 
amples 
(b) Time and accuracy standards combined 
(c) Three factors of time and accuracy standards 
(d) A definite technique described 
(e) Advantages of the suggested technique 
(f£) Use of the progress chart 
(g) Cost of the suggested technique is justified 
Specification VI. Examples in a unit of drill should be in the order of difficulty. 
(a) Range of difficulty should be commensurate with range of abilities 
(b) Easy examples should include all processes 
Specification VII. Drill units should include verbal problems. 
Problem solving should not be isolated. 
Specification VIII. Drills should facilitate diagnosis. 
(a) Remedial work should be specific 
(b) Waste of indiscriminate drill 
(c) Suggested standards of technique facilitates remedial work 
(d) Hard aspects as well as total examples should be present in drills 
(e) Teacher’s cue for remedial work 
Drill in Fifth and Sixth Grades 
For the purpose of facilitating discussion, let us assume by agreement 
that drill or practice has two functions: First, to aid in learning new pro- 
cesses, this use of drill is the instructional use; second, to help maintain a 
skill after the class and the teacher have gone to the trouble of building up 
a new skill. This second use of drill is drill for permanency. ‘The present 
discussion is concerned with the organization of drill material in the fifth 
and sixth grades, the purposes of which are to keep permanent the skills 
that have been built. 
Listing the Skills 
The list of skills to be kept permanently up to standard as a result of 
drill is more or less arbitrary. It should be limited to useful processes as 
developed in Section II above. On this basis, one is justified in listing at 
least the following skills: 
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers. 
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of small fractions; occasionally 
division of simple fractions 
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of decimals as required 
in Unitéd States money
-P-A-G-E-65
    THe THirp YEARBOOK 65   
Computing simple areas and simple percentage 
The time of entrance of these skills into the course of study is conditioned 
by local requirements and should be largely governed by individual interests 
and local needs. Since the topic under discussion is drill for the permanence 
of holding skills, it goes without saying, that if the topics listed above are 
to be drilled to maintain skill in them at the time listed, they must have 
been taught previously to those times. 
Specifications of Proper Drill Organization 
The next pages contain a description of the organization of drill which 
serves the purpose of maintaining skill in a process after.it has been taught 
and after the instructional aspect of the class work is no longer concerned 
with that skill but with some new process. Examples are given supporting 
the specifications for organization of drill which are believed to be superior. 
Examples of contrasting types of drill organization are on occasion inserted 
not for purposes of criticism but to make the specifications, present in the 
report, clear through contrast with opposite types. 
Specification I. Drill Should Be On the Entire Process 
(a) Various forms or types—After instruction on a process is completed, 
the drill given to it should practice in some calculated fashion all the various 
types of that process or all that have been taught. Such drill should con- 
tinue throughout the elementary school. By way of illustrations: 
Example A Example B Example C 
345 768 427640 
567 54, 392769 
879 879 4318 
407 807 915043 
215 423 —   
  
All the drill in the addition of whole numbers given after the process of 
whole numbers has been mastered from the standpoint of instruction should 
not be like Example A above. ‘There should be some drill upon examples 
like B and C, since the ability to neglect gaps in the column is an ability 
that does not come by magic, can just as well be practiced, and is a type 
which the demands of life often present. 
In the present drill services, we note a lack of presenting the pupil with 
addition examples of irregular outline. 
The list of the items which go to make the total process of addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication, or division of whole numbers is a list on which 
there is as yet no common agreement. Following this paragraph, there are 
included the two analyses of processes, subtraction of whole numbers and 
division of fractions. Some such analyses as these should be used to check 
drill provisions. Drill provisions are weak to the extent that they slight 
important units of skill. They are also weak to the extent that they pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
66 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
    
vide unnecessary over-practice or wasteful practice upon units of skill which 
possess no particular difficulty. Obviously, drill is good to the extent that 
it provides practice upon each type of the total skill in proportion to the 
difficulty of each type.

which each number combination occurs.

If an analysis of a year’s drill in the addition of whole numbers revealed 
the fact that the combination 2+ 2 appeared twice as often as did the 
combination 9 + 7, a superintendent would be justified in suspecting that 
the drill work for that year was incorrectly constructed. 
Most review drill work at the present time is constructed more on the 
“number of examples,” or the “number of pages” principle than upon the 
more useful principle of the number of appearances of each combination. 
Figures 1-3 show the frequency with which the several subtraction com- 
binations are practiced in the drill work on the subtraction of whole num- 
bers given in two textbooks, grades three to six. The names of these 
books are withheld for obvious reasons. It should be noted, however, that 
one of these texts observes that aspect of Specification 1 which has to do 
with the distribution of drill upon all the combinations. The other text- 
book serves as a practical contrast with Specification 1. 
A study of Figure 1 will show the reader that while this drill looks 
satisfactory when hurriedly scanned, it does as a matter of fact fail to meet 
Specification 1. ‘Those combinations which involve borrowing, or carrying, 
according to the method of subtraction used, are practiced less frequently 
than those which involve no borrowing or carrying. Thus, the easier is 
practiced the more often. The frequency with which combinations occur 
was evidently not a matter of deliberation. No one would, for instance, 
really purpose to practice 7—6, 156 times and 7—5, 59 times.

It seems fair to say that the theory upon which this drill is built is one 
that maintains that gross quantity of drill or drill by the square inch of

(c) Location of number combinations in all positions—To construct 
drill that will possess a defensible distribution of practice among the various 
number combinations would be a substantial advance upon much of the 
drill material of the present time. A further advance is desirable though 
its attainment involves exceeding care in drill construction. Every num-

ber combination should not only appear with calculated frequency but 
should appear in examples in various places. This variety of position within 
the examples will offset any subtle tendency to learn a number of combina- 
tions in a lopsided fashion. A few illustrations are pertinent.

Generally, it is unwise in drills involving several processes always to 
have the addition example come first, then the subtraction examples, and 
so on. The order in which examples of different processes come, should 
be mixed as well as the examples. This is to offset any subtle help that 
the order of drill work might give to the pupil in forming the harmful 
habit of first adding, then subtracting, etc., in a unit of any kind of 
arithmetic work. ‘This last consideration assumes that the drills for main- 
taining skills previously learned contain examples of several processes, a 
specification defended later in this report. 
(d) Computation difficulties present—Under Specification 1, we are 
concerned not only in practicing all the various types of examples of a 
process that may be expected to appear in real life but in practicing with 
calculated frequency the specific number combinations which occur in that 
process; we are also concerned with the calculated frequency of appearance 
of all the specific difficulties that are contained in that process. 
‘Thus in the addition of whole numbers, it would be possible to practice 
all the combinations and all forms of examples and still practice the carry- 
ing of 1 or nothing practically all the time. ‘This would be patently un- 
fortunate since by the very mechanics of habit-formation, if a pupil carries 1

or nothing most of the time he is more liable to carry 1 (what he usually 
does) when he ought to carry 2, 3, or even 4. 
We are of the opinion that many of the irritating errors of pupils are 
due to the fact that one response has been so favored that it has become 
a preferred response to a situation that should be attached to several 
responses instead of to a single one. Thus a pupil using a textbook or a drill 
service which gives 85 per cent of carrying practice to the carrying of 1 
probably aids and abets errors in carrying. 
(e) Illustrations from texts on appearance of unit skills in fraction 
drills—Table 4 shows the frequency with which the several types of possi- 
bilities in the division of fractions and small mixed numbers are met in five 
standard textbooks during the sixth-grade drill work on maintaining that

bers found in the analysis of the division of fractions given on page 68.

(£) Comments on the distribution of practice among the several unit 
skills involved in the division of fractions—1. The texts vary in their utter 
omission of certain elements of the division of fractions. Of the unit skills 
listed in Table 4, Text A gives no practice on 12 of the unit skills; Text 
B on 16; Text C on 18; Text D on 16; and Text E on 5. 
It is evident that these texts vary in the amount of faith held in transfer. 
To leave out 18 of the unit skills involved in the division of fractions 
assumes a transfer within a function of a type and of an amount that no 
published experimental data support. 
After studying the analysis given above and the omissions in the table, 
the reader will be hard put to it to justify many of the omissions. 
2. These texts vary in their opinion concerning the amounts of drill that 
each unit skill should have. Some of the unit skills receive much practice 
in one text and little or none in another text. ‘Thus children studying 
sixth-grade arithmetic from different texts receive a very different experi- 
ence in the division of fractions. It would be valuable to know the relation- 
ship between the amount of drill in terms of the unit skills involved and 
the frequency of errors in standard tests. 
3. Since the relative difficulty of the several unit skills involved in the 
division of fractions is unknown and since the amount of transfer among 
the unit skills is unknown, the writer of drill material is on uncertain 
ground when he purposely omits or gives but little practice to any of the 
more common unit skills. 4 
(g) Drills can be built to specifications—It is perfectly practical to build 
drill to specifications. As an illustration of this, the following sample of 
drill material in the addition of fractions is inserted.

1. It is further entirely practical that committees in charge of the mak- 
ing of curricula and the providing of instruments of instruction analyze and 
appraise such instruments not only in terms of gross amount but also in 
terms of the internal organization of the material. In fact, specifications 
for drill should be written first and the drills subsequently built according 
to them. 
Summary of Specification I 
A. At the present time, there is a little carelessness in many drill services 
relative to the insertion of all types of examples in drill material. There 
is in many drill services an unfortunate disregard of the proper distribution 
of practice of every combination used in a process. ‘There is a frequent 
omission of proper practice on all the difficulties of procedure within a total 
process. 
B. We do not yet know how many times any given number combina- 
tion should be practiced, nor do we know the relative difficulty of the 
several combinations. Until we do, it is best to practice all combinations 
an equal number of times, or if more practice is given to some combinations 
than to others, we should base this inequality or practice upon some reason- 
able assumptions rather than have the inequality a matter of chance or luck. 
C. In drill construction, scientific specifications should be written first 
and the drills drawn to meet these specifications. The specifications should 
be based on an adequate analysis of the process concerned. 
Specificaticn II. Drill Should Come Frequently in Small Amounts 
(a) Distribution of time for drill on a single process—The nature of 
Specification II can best be described by meeting a concrete situation. Sup- 
pose 100 minutes are allotted to drill in the addition of whole numbers in 
grade six, how can the 100 minutes be best distributed? Consider the 
possibilities below: 
100 minutes all in one drill in September 
50 minutes in September and 50 minutes in June 
25 minutes in September, 25 minutes in November, 25 minutes in 
March, 25 minutes in June 
10 minutes each month 
5 minutes each two weeks 
2% minutes each week. 
(b) Two opposing theories of time distribution—The extremes of prac- 
tice relative to the distribution of drill on any process are based on two 
theories of drill organization which may be called “the cold storage theory” 
and “‘the small doses theory.” The total amount of drill or the time spent 
on drill may well be the same in both instances. The question here is not, 
“How much time shall be spent,” but “How shall any given amount of 
time be distributed through the year?” 
(c) The cold storage theory and its weaknesses—The present practice 
of textbook organization, with two notable exceptions, leans to the cold 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
storage theory. ‘The embarrassment of having to defend the cold storage 
theory of drill is avoided by occasional footnotes to teachers telling them 
to practice on a certain drill frequently during the rest of the year. This 
attempt at avoiding the weaknesses of the cold storage theory of drill 
organization carries no guarantee of success since the average classroom 
teacher has many things on her mind, is always pressed for time, and 
rightly feels that the text should as far as possible arrange material in 
defensible order rather than ask her to do what the author of the text 
could do himself. 
Another and much more successful escape from the cold storage theory 
of drill organization is the use of practice material which is quite inde- 
pendent of the text. By the use of these drill services a pupil can practice 
a skill at frequent intervals. It should be pointed out, however, that the 
use of many of the drill services will by no means guarantee the maintain- 
ing of skills since other imported specifications of good drill are slighted 
in them. 
Space will not be taken here to defend the practice of giving a little 
drill frequently as opposed to giving large amounts at long intervals. The 
psychology of forgetting and the futility of practice at any one time in 
excess of a rather modest optimum are too well known by the readers of 
this report to need rehearsing here. 
(d) Illustrations from texts on time distribution of drill on division of 
fractions— Table 5 shows the degrees of respect paid to the specification of 
drill organization which has to do with the time distribution of drill. 
Five reputable textbooks of sixth-grade arithmetic are used for illustra- 
tion. The progress of a class through each textbook for the school year 
was estimated by eight competent and experienced teachers of arithmetic. 
Each textbook was divided into 36-week sections by each of the eight judges 
estimating the natural progress of a class through each book separately. 
‘The eight judgments for each book were then averaged. This average was 
used as the 36 weekly divisions of each text. In Table 5 each week rep- 
resents the amount of work that a class would do if the total book is finished 
during the year. Since the amount of material in the texts studied varies, 
classes using one text might have to go faster per hour or spend more hours 
or omit more material than a similar class using another of the texts. Of 
course all classes do not go at the same rate and no one class may go at 
exactly the rate used here. These considerations, however, are vital to the 
consideration of distributed versus concentrated drill. 
(e) Comments on the illustrations of fraction drill—1. If the organiza- 
tion of drill in texts A, B, C, and D is correct, then the organization of 
drill work in text E is wrong, and the reverse. While no important 
significance should be attached to minor differences in drill organization, it 
is obvious that the theories underlying the construction of the five texts 
above are radically different. Texts A, B, C, and D practice the theory 
that large amounts of drill infrequently are an economical method of main- 
taining a skill. Text E is built on the theory that a little drill weekly is

* Certain examples in the division of fractions included in Text E are omitted from this count 
because they are incorporated in a series of inventory units which are not paralleled by similar units in 
the other texts. 
an economical method to use in maintaining skills. It is hardly possible 
that both theories are equally sound. 
2. It might be urged that the texts A, B, C, and D assume the use of 
drill pads. - However, although there are available at the present time 
various drill services for whole numbers, there is no widely used drill 
service for fractions. ; 
3. There is a difference of opinion as to the amount of drill that is 
necessary. Text A uses the same theory of infrequency of practice as does 
text C. Yet text A gives exactly twice as much practice. Here again 
both texts cannot be right. If 168 examples in the division of fractions is 
the correct amount of practice for a sixth-grade text, then text A has made 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
adequate provision but text C fails to give enough practice. However, if 
about 90 practices during the sixth grade is an adequate provision then 
text A provides wasteful overpractice while text C provides sufficient drill. 
4, The difference in the amount of drill between text A and text E may 
be explained by the difference in the distribution. It is possible that text 
E with its distributed practice will give as much or more skill with 88 
practices as one will get from 168 concentrated practices of text A. 
5. It is also possible that the authors of the texts desire different amounts 
of skill. If this is so, we have a defense for the varying amounts of prac- 
tice. The fact is that text E alone gives any usable information about 
standards of attainment in the division of fractions. It is doubtful if the 
problem of attainment in measurable terms was dealt with seriously by the 
other texts. 
Specification III. A Drill Unit Should Be a Mixed Drill 
A further consideration of drill organization has to do with the content 
of any single drill unit. If we agree to have short drills used frequently 
for any single process (Specification II) ; if we agree to have in the examples 
used for any one process as they run along in sequence, practice all the 
combinations, appear in various forms, and possess the obvious and hidden 
difficulties in an orderly fashion, we have yet to agree upon the nature of 
any single drill unit. 
Shall we practice addition of whole numbers today, subtraction of whole 
numbers tomorrow, multiplication the next day, and so on? Or shall we 
practice a little of each process so far mastered in each drill unit? 
(a) Let us call the theory of having each drill unit possess but one 
process the Isolation Theory, and the theory of having each drill unit con- 
tain several or all processes mastered at the time the Mixed Fundamental 
Theory. With these definitions in mind, a proper specification for drill 
units to maintain skill is the use of the Mixed Fundamental Theory. 
Below are examples organized according to the two theories.

Other processes could be drilled upon in this fashion: 
(c) Contrast this use of the Isolation Theory with the use of the Mixed 
Fundamental Theory. Note that the examples given above appear in these 
mixed fundamental drills on page 81. 
The examples of the mixed fundamental theory of drill organization here 
given are used in the first half of the sixth grade. Similar drills used in 
the last half of the sixth grade would contain examples of processes mastered 
during the year. Those who organize the drill work upon the mixed 
fundamental theory should make it a point to insert into each drill unit 
examples of each new process as soon as it is mastered from the instruction 
of the year. In this way each process that a pupil has learned is practiced 
upon at very short intervals. 
(d) Examples of each skill to contain calculated practice—This same 
principle of frequent practice upon the process should be extended to the 
items that constitute the process itself. ‘Thus to have a little addition of 
whole numbers at frequent intervals is not enough or at least is not the best 
that we can do by way of drill provision. The addition examples should 
be so constructed that if the combination 6 + 9 is practiced 20 times during 
the year those 20 practices should not be bunched so that the practice will 
come at any one time. ‘The addition examples should be so built that the 
6 + 9 appears as evenly and widely distributed throughout the year as is 
reasonably possible. 
(e) Mixed fundamentals type recommended—At the present time, 
crucial experimentation is lacking to prove that the mixed fundamental 
theory of drill is really more effective than the isolation theory. However, 
there are certain considerations which make it the preferred type of drill 
until the crucial experimentation is performed. Some of these considera- 
tions are: 
1. Life does not bring us addition on Monday, subtraction on Tuesday, 
division on Wednesday, etc. ‘The demands that life puts upon arithmetical 
skill are to be able to use the several processes separately and to be able to 
use them together, in any order, and several times during the same work 
period. It is good psychology to practice a total skill as we shall have to 
use it. ‘The total hierarchy of arithmetic habits formed by the work of the 
first six grades will be better organized if we practice at one time the total
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
hierarchy, not segments of it in isolation one from the other. The Mixed 
Fundamentals type of drill puts together the things that belong together. 
The Isolation type of drill keeps apart the things that should not be kept 
apart. 
2. From the observation of pupils at work there is reason to suspect that 
the monotony of drill work is greatly relieved by a change of process used. 
3. Many of the more recent texts in arithmetic are using the Mixed 
Fundamental type of drill for the maintenance of skills previously learned. 
There are no administrative exigencies which make the use of the Mixed 
Fundamentals type of drill impractical. 
4. Breakdowns in any one process due to forgetting are more immediately 
located since the mixed fundamental type of drill organization allows all 
skills to be passed in review with great frequency. 
5. Mixed drills tend to offset the practice of working the wrong process 
in taking a Standard Test. In analysing errors made on standard tests it 
is found that many of the errors are not ones of computation at all but 
persistence of procedure. ‘Thus if the first three examples on a test are 
addition and the next three subtraction there is a tendency to add instead 
ot subtract in the three subtraction drills in regular class work. If from 
the start pupils become accustomed to treating examples in drill work as 
units, not assuming because the first examples are in addition all must be, 
this type of error will be greatly reduced. 
Summary of Specification III. A. For drill to maintain skills the Mixed 
Fundamental Type of organization is preferable. 
B. Care should be taken to insert into the drills examples of a process as 
soon as it is mastered. No process should ever drop out of the drills after 
it is inserted, though examples of the easier processes may become increas- 
ingly infrequent. 
Specification IV. Drills Should Possess Time Limits 
(a) Speed a secondary consideration—Although the world at large pays 
no extra bonus for phenomenal speed in mathematical computation except 
to vaudeville performers, it does penalize excessive slowness. It is not 
within the province of the elementary school to develop excessive speed, and 
there need not be major emphasis on speed in elementary school arithmetic. 
Accuracy is an objective far overshadowing in value ambitions of spectacular 
speed. It should be borne in mind, however, that accuracy and slowness 
are not significantly correlated and that a certain measure of speed is not 
only demanded from the world but is also a measure of attainment in and 
of itself. 
It is not correct to think of drill work for the maintenance of skills as a 
process to be done accurately in any amount of time. It is work to be done 
accurately within a reasonable time. Reasonable time is to be defined as 
that amount of time required by the pupil to complete the work when he is 
working hard and economically on material that he has been well taught.

82 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
This amount of time varies with individual pupils, and a single time 
standard for all members of a class should be used only where rating devices 
allow for various amounts of product. To ask all to do the same amount 
in the same time denies most of the important facts of individual differences 
and such standards are always of superficial value. 
In view of the fact that most competent superintendents accept the 
specification for drill that is concerned with time standards the question is 
not, “Shall we use time standards in drill work?” but, ‘What type of 
time standards is the effective type?’ “The latter question will be discussed 
in this chapter. 
(b) Wrong types of time standards—Type A. To use any variation of 
the following type of time standard in drill work is wrong: “See how long 
it takes you to work the following exercise.’ We find in current use the 
above type of time standard in various forms. Your committee wishes to 
oppose the use of this type for the following reason. 
It is fundamentally a matter of curiosity not a matter of educational 
direction. If a child finds that a certain exercise takes him ten minutes to 
work that knowledge may or may not be of some interest to him. But the 
use he is to make of that knowledge is not forthcoming. He is given no 
information to use in making such judgments as these: 
Am 5 working too slowly? 
Am I working too fast? 
Am I fast for my grade? 
Am I slow for my grade? 
The information asked for in the type of time standard above leaves the 
whole matter of speed of performance dangling in the thin air. 
Type B. Another wrong type of time standard is any variation of the 
following: “Practice upon this exercise until you can do it correctly in ten 
minutes.” 
There are several reasons why this type of time standard in any of its 
many disguises should not be tolerated. Among these reasons are: 
1. The time standard given is rarely a properly derived standard. Such 
a time standard cannot be derived from the demands of the business world 
and thus be a minimum requirement for the commercial use of skills built 
in the elementary school, because the speed requirements of business have 
never been determined except in extremely local situations. Probably there 
are no speed requirements of business widespread enough to be useful in this 
connection. 
2. The time standard given in this way is seldom properly derived from 
the performances of pupils in the school. The amount of genuinely 
standardized drill work is surprisingly limited. Time standards for single 
drill units have usually been determined from the average performance of 
a few classes—often from a very restricted area. And, while in all proba- 
bility there are some time standards in some textbooks that have been 
actually determined by experimentation, the sampling area used has often
-P-A-G-E-83
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 83 
been so restricted that the standard resulting from improper sampling has 
vitiated the use of these for even computing class averages on a country- 
wide basis. 
3. A single time standard can give a true measure of nothing but class 
performance and then it is a function of the type of teaching and drill work 
that the particular classes used. To set up as a generalized time standard 
in drill, a time limit based on classes whcih give 25 minutes a day to arith- 
metic, should be quite useless for classes which give 40 minutes’a day to 
arithmetic. ‘Time standards derived from classes which use an outworn 
type of drill organization would be too easy for classes which use more 
effective types of drill organization. 
4. The main reason why a single time standard such as any variation of 
‘Type B must in necessity be pedagogically wrong is that its use is restricted 
to the mythical “average” child. Suppose it were known that the average 
performance of all the fifth grades in the country upon a certain exercise 
was exactly ten minutes. To use this knowledge by telling fifth grade 
pupils to practice upon that exercise until they could do it in ten minutes 
would be a fine example of educational blundering. (And the fact that 
many drills now use a single time standard does not make it any less of a 
blunder. Universality of use in a growing science like education is no proof 
of merit.) 
A single time standard is a blunder, for it refuses to use most of the 
important facts of individual differences. Thus, a properly derived single 
average time standard is useful to only pupils of average ability. It is 
positively harmful to superior pupils because it says to them, ‘‘Practice upon 
this exercise until you can do it in the time it takes pupils of less ability to 
do it. Thus, bind to yourself habits and ideals of work far below your true 
capacity. Form habits of working at half effort so that when you get out 
in the world if you are ambitious you will have many habits as the result 
of your education that you will have to break.” 
It tells the more limited pupils to do what they cannot do at all or which 
they can do only by expending an unwise amount of time. To ask a pupil 
to practice on an exercise until he can do it correctly in ten minutes is mis- 
education, if the child is significantly below the average in ability. It may 
be useful in the sense that it tells the slow pupil with cruel bluntness that 
he is limited. And, such knowledge may be of value. It is vicious in that 
it presents to the slow pupil situations which are inveterately discouraging 
thus creating a negative attitude toward school, which hurts in subtle as 
well as overt ways. It would be as sensible to tell a plump 45 year-old lady 
to jump 5 feet from a standing position because that was the average dis- 
tance that all adults can jump, as it is to tell a limited pupil to try to work 
an exercise in ten minutes because that was the time in which the average 
pupil could work it. 
Type C. Another misuse of the time standard technique is to ask a child 
to practice upon an exercise until he can do it rapidly, or as fast as he thinks
-P-A-G-E-84
  84+ DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
he ought to do it. On a moment's reflection it will be seen that such vague 
standards as “rapidly” or any variation of undetermined amounts of time are 
absurd. Yet a large fraction of pupils at the present time are using just 
such senseless time standards. 
In the long run, competent superintendents will not use time standards 
in any form apart from accuracy standards, also. Since 100 per cent 
accuracy within a time standard is a procedure that carries with it too 
many disadvantages to make it practical, this report will delay positive sug- 
gestions concerning time standards until the subject of accuracy standards 
has been discussed. 
Summary of Specification IV. Any variations of the following types of 
‘Time Standards are either vicious, or futile, or less useful than other types 
of time standards. ‘They should not be used.’ Correct methods are given 
later. 
Type A, See how long it takes you to do this exercise. 
Type B. Practice upon this exercise until you can do it in ten minutes. 
Type C. Practice upon this exercise until you can do it rapidly. 
Specification V. Drills Should Use Accuracy Standards 
(a) The wrong way to use the 100 per cent accuracy standard—\t 
would seem at first glance that the matter of accuracy standards is very 
simple, because we need just one standard—namely, 100 per cent for all 
work. However, the matter of accuracy standards is not so simple as 
this. We can isolate the factors to be considered by a few illustrations: 
Suppose we tell a child to practice upon a list of examples until he can 
do it with 100 per cent accuracy. If this means until you can take the list 
as a whole and work it all through without error, the direction is an unwise 
one. Not unwise theoretically, but unwise in the practical situation. 
Consider the following typical case: 
Let the exercise contain 20 examples. The first time the child works the 
exercise he misses (for illustration) examples 8, 14, and 19. Since he did 
not get 100 per cent accuracy on the first trial he must repeat the exercise 
asa whole. This time he misses only example 19. Since he did not get 100 
per cent accuracy, he must work the whole exercise again. This time he 
gets all the examples correct. He would then pass on to the next card if 
he is using a drill service which gives directions for 100 per cent accuracy 
before leaving a card or goes on in the text if the drill is in the text. 
Such repetition involves doing three times examples which the pupil got 
correct on the first trial. ‘This approximates a type of wasteful over- 
practice opposition to which has been much neglected in current thinking 
about drill organization. It is poor investment of time to practice on what 
the pupil needs no practice upon. If in order to practice upon examples 
done incorrectly, a pupil must repeat much work that he already has 
mastered, we cannot hope for the best interest in drill work for much of it is 
obviously futile. If we take the time to repeat correct work in order to
-P-A-G-E-85
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 85   
wipe out errors in a few examples—that is, do all the work correct at any 
one time, we expend much time in repeating correct work. This would 
not be both harmful and silly, but only silly if the pupil was gifted with 
eternal life for elementary school education. But, with the crowded curri- 
culum of the present time we must save even minutes wherever we can. 
We waste time when we demand 100 per cent accuracy at any one sitting 
in drill work through the demand that everything must be done correctly 
at once. 
Further, a more serious charge may be brought against 100 per cent 
accuracy on a complete unit of work at any one time. While not theoretic- 
ally necessary, it is often the actual fact that when all the work is repeated 
the attention of the pupil is centered on getting the whole exercise correct 
at any one time and the tendency is away from intensive study of particular 
errors made. Thus, correctness often comes through trial and error, rather 
than from enlightened study of specific errors made. ‘The whole spirit of 
100 per cent accuracy of the whole exercise is to try the whole exercise 
again tomorrow, and due to scant time it too often means plunging right 
into the whole exercise, doing over many examples already done correctly 
but omitting a study of errors made, 
‘The correct procedure is not to repeat the whole exercise but correct at 
once any mistakes made on the first trial and practice correctly at least three 
times the examples missed. Without emphasis on the correction of errors, 
as specific errors to be studied by themselves, practice on error rather than 
practice in correctness is often the fact. One hundred per cent accuracy 
standards on whole exercises, as actually used in drill work, are not effective. 
Such a technique of accuracy standards involves: 
1. Much wasteful time over-practice through repetition of correct work. 
2. Reduces interest through the futility of doing over what was done 
correctly. 
3. Takes the attention away from an intensive study of specific errors. 
(b) Time and accuracy combined—Standards should be in terms of 
ratings made on first trial with generous time allowance. Obviously time 
standards without accuracy standards are to be looked at with suspicion. 
Also, accuracy standards with no time standards fail to take care of 
important aspects of competent work. ‘The following combination of time 
and accuracy standards is suggested as an adequate technique for the par- 
ticularizing of specifications of drill organization relative to standards. 
(c) The three factors of combined accuracy and time standards—Factor 
one—A time limit. This is to be generous. It is to be experimentally deter- 
mined. It should be such that more than half the class can finish the drill 
in the time given. No rewards are offered for spectacular speed, No 
penalties for moderate rates of work. The emphasis is taken from speed 
and placed on power. 
Factor two. A rating in terms of number examples correct in .a given 
amount of time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  
86 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
Factor three. Emphasis should be on correction of specific errors, not on 
repetition of work correct, as well as wrong. 
(d) A definite technique described—Consider the possibilities of the 
following type of standards organized for each unit of drill -work. 
(Adapted from drill material. Permission granted by the publisher.) 
PRACTICE ON THE FUNDAMENTALS 
Self-testing Drill No. 12. Number your paper before the signal 
“Go!” is given. Wherever possible, save copying by placing your paper 
right below any example. Copy only when necessary. 
You will be allowed exactly 20 minutes. Work as fast as you can with- 
out making mistakes. Do the examples and problems in order. 
Try to beat all your past records. Use your work on the first trial for 
rating. Rate yourself by the standards below. 
There follows a drill unit. In this instance it is built on the Mixed 
Fundamental Theory, with distributed practice. At the end of the drill 
come the standards as follows: 
Standards. 
Number correct 0 1-2 3-4 5-6 7-8 9-10 11 12 13 14 15 
Rating 2 isco Ont 2 3 4 5 (Pave t ine Sooty) 
After you have recorded your rating, correct at once any mistake you 
may have made. 
(e) Advantage of the suggested technique—The Standards organization 
above possess these possibilities : 
1. Assuming that the rating device uses facts determined by statistically 
sound experimentation, provision is made for measuring amount of correct 
product per time allowance. 
Since ratings from 0 to 10 are given, provision is made for individual 
differences. Thus, a rating of 6 might be laid down as minimum perform- 
ance to pass, but good work brings tangible evidence of merit through 
higher ratings. ‘The rating scheme allows a pupil to know not only that 
he is doing well or poorly, but also to know how well or how poorly he is 
doing. 
2. The above device allows ratings on drill units and thus the drill units 
themselves to be a continuous process throughout the year. While it would 
be practically impossible to construct tests of identical difficulty for a year’s 
work, yet drill units can be constructed sufficiently equal in difficulty to use 
a rating device like the one above. By proper treatment of the pupil’s per- 
formances used in making the standards, a rating of five can mean the 
same thing throughout the year. Thus, a rating of 5 on drill 2 can mean 
the same thing as a rating of 5 on Drill 12 or 22 or 32. A pupil can keep 
a record of his progress on drills in an orderly and a meaningful fashion. A 
rating of 1 or 2 or 4 or 6, etc., can always mean the same thing because
-P-A-G-E-87
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 87 
  
the ratings would not be computed in percentage of work done correctly 
which would involve a long series of drills of identical difficulty not only 
for each drill as a whole but for small parts of each drill. The ratings 
can be computed, as they were in the drills used as illustration, in terms 
of the number of pupils getting varying numbers of examples correct on 
each drill. Thus, a rating of 6 might mean the getting correct of 11 ex- 
amples in Drill 12, but a rating of 6 might mean getting correct only 10 
examples on drill 22 if adequate experimentation showed that Drill 22 was 
slightly harder. 
3. By using a device like the one above a pupil works on drill, knowing 
at the time of effort how well he did in rather exact terms. By keeping his 
record of his ratings from drill to drill, he can form an honest and statisti- 
cally correct estimate of his progress through the year. If he gets low rat- 
ings at first but improves, his ratings will show him that fact. If he does 
well at the beginning of the year and begins to loaf, that fact will be re- 
vealed by the use of the type of standard organization here suggested. 
(£) The use of the progress chart—1. By using a progress chart such as 
is often used a pupil can see for himself what he is doing on drill work 
as the year goes on. He can, in fact, begin to think in pretty definite terms 
about his work and thus in some measure at least become responsible for 
his own progress. 
2. The use of such standards is by no means limited to its effect through 
definiteness upon the interest of the child. Granted that the standards are 
true ones, they are immediately useful for grading pupils. ‘They also 
organize the work of the class in such form that the superintendent can at 
a glance see what any given class is doing, not only in the estimation of a 
teacher which might be slightly erroneous, not only from his own observa- 
tion, which might be slightly hurried, not only in terms of standard tests 
which are given at infrequent intervals but in measurable objective terms 
from normal class work. Such accurate data admit of a type of supervision 
that many wish to do but cannot do for want of the essential data. 
3. Further, it is to be noted that the type of standards suggested above 
do not require the repeating of the whole exercise including examples done 
correctly. On the contrary it places the emphasis on correcting at once the 
actual mistakes made. This gives an opportunity though by no means 
guarantees that pupils will be led to the study of specific errors made as 
opposed to the more or less repeating of whole units of work. 
4. By having the ratings made on the first trial, repetition of error is 
avoided. No practice “in the dark” is called for. The procedure of the 
standard test technique is approximated. 
‘The above technique, while not perfect, makes greater uses of the strong 
points in the test and standardization movement, and avoids more of the 
weak points of improper uses of standards than any other method that has 
yet come to the writer’s notice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
(g) The cost is justifiable—There is one weak point in the use of this 
device. To build correct standards in terms of several ratings instead of a 
single standard involves a huge expenditure of time and money, provided of 
course that the standards are properly obtained. In fact, the use of such 
standards means the taking of carefully constructed standardized tests and 
using them as drill units. As far as the writer knows, this has been done 
but once. Dr. G. M. Ruch, of the University of Iowa, has standardized 
64 drills for the fifth grade and 60 drills for the sixth grade, using the 
rating and standards technique herein described. 
Summary of Specification V. One hundred per cent accuracy standards 
as applied to a list of examples are unwise for the following reasons: 
(a) They involve wasteful overpractice on examples done correctly the 
first time. z 
(b) -They do not provide careful study of specific errors. 
(c) They reduce interest because of useless repetitions. 
Factors of Combined Time and Accuracy Standards 
(a) Time limits are to be generous, placing chief emphasis on accuracy 
rather than on speed alone. 
(b) Rating should be in terms of examples done correctly in a given 
amount of time. 
(c) Emphasis should be on correction of specific errors. 
Provision should be made for self-testing drills to be given once a week 
rather than two or three times a year. These should be accompanied by a 
rating scale and progress chart. 
(a) Provision is made for individual differences. 
(b) A given rating on one drill can be made approximately of the same 
value on all drills, and so throughout all the drills for the year, thus giving 
the pupil a continuous standard to rate himself on. 
(c) The pupil is then motivated by awareness of success. 
(d) Dependable data are made available for the teacher and supervisor. 
Specification VI. Examples in a Drill Should Come in Order of Difficulty 
(a) Range of difficulty commensurate with range of abilities—Since the 
typical class harbors pupils of widely varying ability, each drill should pro- 
vide some work that all, or almost all, pupils can do. It should also pro- 
vide some work that will tax the ability of even the ablest pupil. By 
arranging the individual examples in each drill, from easiest to hardest, the 
slowest pupil is able to get something from each class exercise. It is equally 
important that the ablest pupils be given more often than they are a little 
work that is a worthy foe for their steel. Up to the present time, drill 
work has been designed for the more limited pupils. 
(b) Easy examples should include more than one process—It is wise in 
taking care of this specification to make sure that all the easy problems are
-P-A-G-E-89
  Tue THirp YEARBOOK 89   
not concerned with one process. We should make sure that limited pupils 
receive practice on their own level in all the processes they have learned up 
to the time of any particular drill. 
Specification VII, Drill Work Should Include Verbal Problems 
(a) Problem solving should not be isolated—It is unwise to keep apart 
those things that ought to work together. The ultimate justification for all 
drill work is the beneficial results it has upon solving problems in contrast 
to examples, for life is concerned with problems, not mere drill examples. 
If all drill work is kept persistently apart from practice in problem solving, 
the pupil does not operate together the skills which ought to operate to- 
gether. 
Crucial experimentation to support this contention is lacking. But in 
the absence of such experimentation, it is better to practice good instead of 
poor theory. 
The samples of drill organization in Appendix C show verbal problems 
as organic parts of drill units. 
Summary of Specification VII. Verbal problems should be included as 
organic parts of drill units. Problem solving should not be isolated. 
Specification VIII, Drills Should Facilitate the Diagnosis of Specific Error 
for the Facilitation of Remedial Work 
(a) Remedial work should be specific—In remedial work, it is almost 
essential to drill on the specific skills that are weak in contrast to drill on 
both the strong and weak in an indiscriminate manner. 
(b) The waste of indiscriminate drill—Indiscriminate drill is indulged 
in when the directions call for the repetition of all the drill including 
examples done correctly as well as those done incorrectly. It might be 
urged by those who show a marked lack of insight into practical school 
conditions that the redoing of examples that possess no. difficulty to a child 
is not a cause of criticism, because such practice will not do any harm, may 
do good in general, and the pupil has plenty of time anyway. 
All of these defenses are false. ‘The repeating of work done correctly 
does positive harm, if continued. No self-respecting pupil of even third 
grade judgment can have much respect or loyalty to a drill service which 
calls for the same treatment of correct work that it does for incorrect 
work—namely, to do it over. A negative set toward drill work n the part 
of many pupils is not a symptom of contrariness. It is a symptom of com- 
mon sense. It also tends to take the attention away from specific errors 
which, incidentally, are the only important type of errors pupils make. The 
argument that there is plenty of time anyway needs no refutation here. 
(c) The suggested standard technique facilitates remedial work—The 
drill organization defended in specifications V and VI, which have the 
ratings made on the first trial, avoids the blunder of repeating work done 
correctly and tends to center attention on errors made. This organiza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
tion approximates the conditions under which standard tests are given. The 
child does not keep working on a unit until he can do it all correctly. He 
makes his rating and then corrects his errors. He can make a better rating 
on the next drill, more surely by a study of his errors in the time available 
than he can if he spends a major portion of his time in repeating work 
already done correctly. 
(d) Hard aspects, as well as complete examples, should be present in 
drills. We can, however, provide other measures for remedial work. In 
drill construction, it is not compelling to have only total processes presented. 
To the extent that we know the particular hard spots in processes, we can 
drill on these in isolation. While the carry over to the total process is 
probably not 100 per cent perfect, it may be sufficient to pay when the time 
factor is given due weight. Just as we learn bit by bit, so we can drill bit 
by bit, especially on the hard bits. 
(e) The teacher’s cue for remedial work. If a teacher will notice what 
types of examples are being missed most frequently, he can make a good 
guess as to what total process needs special drill the most. If, in addition, 
the crucial or hard spots on the several processes are inserted in the drills 
he can locate with useful but not complete exactness whatever part of a 
total process needs special attention. 
The last word in remedial work in arithmetic will, however, not be 
spoken until a whole series of studies on that complex subject has been 
made, based upon pupils who have had good drill from the start. This 
will be a matter of some years. 
Comments on remedial work to follow systematic drill work are con- 
siderably compressed in this report for two reasons. First, it is not at 
present known what errors are due to genuine learning difficulty and what 
errors are due to faulty construction of drill. It is probable that much 
need for remedial work lies not in giving pupils more drill but in giving 
them better drill from the first. If errors are due to the wrong experiences 
and lack of experiences in systematic drill, then the main drive upon 
remedial work should be upon the reconstruction of drill work from the 
start. There is some ground for the contention that much of the remedial 
work now needed will no longer be needed when drill work meets more 
adequately the specifications suggested in this report. 
We are not concerned in the science of education with the planning of 
remedial work for pupils who have not had the correct experience with 
numbers in their systematic instruction and drill. We are concerned with 
remedial work for errors which persist after the pupil has had the best type 
of drill available. What these persistent errors are will not be known until 
a sufficiently large number of pupils has had several years of drill which 
meet proper specifications. 
The second reason why remedial work is not stressed in this report is

Summary of Specification VIII. Directions for drills and the organ- 
ization of standards for drill should direct the attention to specific errors. 
Teachers should note which process is being missed most frequently in 
drill work. Special emphasis should be placed on this process. 
Specific work on the crucial parts of a total process should be inserted 
in units of drills, so that guidance may be given to both teacher and pupils 
as to what specific weakness may exist. 
IV. What is the Best Procedure for Building up Ability to Handle 
Concrete or Reasoning Problems? 
Isolated reasoning problems are not meeting the demands of life as 
it is. Under life conditions, problems are solved when the individual 
is keen as to consequences. Any calculating is a small detail in a larger 
unified process. The condition is being met in the schools by building up 
pupil experience, by confining number work in the lower grades to actual 
needs, and by providing artificial life situations for the intermediate and 
upper grades such as conducting a cafeteria, managing a department store 
sale, or working out large unit problems in any form. This whole matter 
of reasoning is connected with the problem of larger units of instruction 
properly motivated and the building up of pupil experience. ‘There is no 
doubt that in the past, much time has been spent on meaningless puzzle 
and academic material. The result has been a minimum amount of under- 
standing and a maximum amount of discouragement for the children. 
Following is a brief summary of available studies on reasoning in arith- 
metic: 
STUDY NO. 23. Davies, G. R. “Elements of arithmetical ability.” 
Journal of Educational Psychology, Vol. V, 1914. pp. 131-140. 
The purpose of this investigation was to determine to what extent com- 
putation, reasoning, visualizing, memory span and “mental arithmetic” are 
related to each other and to what extent each is related to “general effi- 
ciency” in arithmetic. Special tests were designed to give measures of com- 
putation, reasoning, visualizing, memory span, and mental arithmetic. The 
term “grades” in arithmetic was used as measures of general efficiency. 
Data were obtained from two adult classes numbering 29 and 32 persons. 
By statistical methods (rank order correlations) the following, among lesser 
important conclusions, were arrived at: ‘There is (1) a close relationship 
between the skills in the four fundamental operations; (2) a rather close 
relationship between computation and term grades (1r=0.44+.10); (3) a 
very slight relationship between visualization and memory, memory span 
and “mental” arithmetic, memory span and visualization; (4) a rather high 
relationship between visualization and term grades, and between visualiza- 
tion and reasoning; (5) a very slight relationship between computation and

reasoning; (6) a close relationship between reasoning and term grades; 
and (7) a very great variation among the pupils in each ability. 
The investigation lacks reliability because of the small number of persons 
from whom data were obtained. The principal conclusion calls attention 
to the close connection between reasoning and general efficiency in arith- 
metic. 
STUDY NO. 24. Newcomb, R. 8. ‘Teaching pupils how to solve 
problems in arithmetic.” Elementary School Journal, Vol. 23, 1922-23, 
pp. 183-9. 
Mr. R. S. Newcomb, of the East Central State Teachers College, Ada, 
Oklahoma; compared the effectiveness of the “usual manner” of solving 
problems with a method that emphasized a “careful, systematic and log- 
ical” procedure. He chose four classes of seventh and eighth grade pupils 
to whom he taught the proposed method. “Iwo other classes were used 
as the check or control group. The initial and final ability of both groups 
were measured by the Stone Reasoning Test 2. 
In the “‘careful, systematic and logical” procedure the pupils were in- 
structed to (1) understand each word in the problem, (2) read the prob- 
lem intelligently, (3) add, subtract, multiply, and divide with speed and 
accuracy, (4) determine what is given in the problem, (5) determine what 
is required, (6) select the different processes to be used in the solution 
and the order in which these processes are to be used, (7) plan the solution 
wisely and systematically, and (8) check readily. 
After “twenty carefully prepared problems of graded difficulty” had 
been taught to the four classes comprising the experimental group, one 
each day, Stone Reasoning Test 2 was repeated. The test results showed 
that the experimental group had made appreciably greater improvement 
both in accuracy of reasoning and speed in reasoning. ‘The experiment 
suggests that pupils do profit from instruction in the method or technique 
of problem solving. 
STUDY NO. 25. Banting, G. O. ‘The elimination of difficulties in 
teasoning,” Second Yearbook of the Department of Elementary School Prin- 
cipals. Wash., D. CG. Department of Elementary School Principals. 
A study of pupils’ difficulties in reasoning was made in the Waukesha 
(Wisconsin) schools by G. O. Banting in 1922. The causes of failure or 
of inability to reason correctly were found to be lack of general ability 
in silent reading, lack of familiarity with technical terms in arithmetic, 
carelessness in reading, lack of the experiences necessary to understand 
the “setting” of the problem, inadequate skill in computing, lack of knowl- 
edge of such essential facts as tables of weights and measures, inability 
to see the relationships in the problem so as to choose the proper operation, 
inability to do reflective thinking, and the like. In codperation with the 
teachers, Mr. Banting devised corrective or remedial devices for each of 
these difficulties. For example, in teaching pupils to associate the proper

operation with the context of the problem, easy one step, two step, and 
three step problems, to which the pupils responded by giving the appropriate 
operation (or operations) were designed; pupils were practiced in making 
up problems in which a given operation (or a combination of operations) 
was used; and lists of miscellaneous problems were analyzed, so as to dis- 
cover the problems whose solution required a given operation (or a com- 
bination of operations). Mr. Banting’s study is reprinted in Educational 
Bulletin, Number 5, recently published by the Minneapolis public schools. 
This bulletin contains excellent suggestions for teaching arithmetic. 
STUDY NO. 26. Stevenson, P. R. ‘‘Increasing the ability of pupils to 
solve arithmetic problems.” Education Research Bulletin (Ohio State Uni- 
versity) Vol. III, No. 13. 
P. R. Stevenson measured the increase in ability to solve arithmetic 
problems that followed twelve weeks of remedial instruction in the tech- 
nique of problem-solving. During the first, second, and third of the 
twelve weeks the pupils were taught to analyze textbook problems. Many 
types of problems containing data from actual life situations were solved 
during the fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks. ‘The'problems were collected 
by the pupils. During the third three-week period the pupils solved prob- 
lems ‘“‘without numbers.” ‘The last of the three-week periods was devoted 
to a study of the difficult words that appear in textbook problems. As 
a result of the twelve weeks’ instruction, the increase in power to solve 
problems, as measured by the Buckingham Scale and the Stevenson Prob- 
lem Analysis Test, was approximately equal to the gains that pupils nor- 
mally make during an entire year. Stevenson’s data showed that the 
slower pupils made the greater gains.

Hunkins and Breed conducted an investigation to determine the rela- 
tive validity of seven reasoning tests in arithmetic. “These tests were given 
to 127 pupils in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. By statistical 
methods, a composite score for all of the tests was found for each pupil. 
The best test was the one whose scores were in closest agreement with 
the composite scores. The final rating or merit of the tests arranged them 
in this order: (1) The Stone Reasoning Test, (2) and (3) the arith- 
metic reasoning sections of the Haggerty Intelligence Examination, and 
the Otis Group Intelligence Scale, Advanced Examination, (4) the arith- 
metic reasoning section of its National Intelligence Test, (5) Starch’s

STUDY NO. 28. Stone, John C. Standardized reasoning tests in 
arithmetic and how to use them. Bureau of Publications, Teachers Col- 
lege, Columbia University, New York City. 
In his Standardized Reascning Tests in Arithmetic and How To Use 
Them, Stone indicates that standardized tests are useful in surveys, in 
supervision, and in teaching. Just as the skilful physician measures, 
diagnoses, prescribes treatment, and measures again, so will the good 
teacher measure, diagnose, prescribe remedial treatment, and measure again. 
Stone suggests the making of diagnostic records, showing the specific diff- 
culties of each pupil. He cautions teachers not to place too much reliance 
on a single test record of an individual pupil. The descriptions of how 
certain pupils increased their efficiency in reasoning by being taught to read 
the problem more carefully, to use less labelling in the written solutions, 
and the like, indicate the value of tests in improving teaching. 
STUDY NO. 29. 4 comparison of two methods analyzing problems. 
A study soon to be published by The Lincoln School, Columbia University, 
New York City. 
Most textbooks in arithmetic suggest that pupils should analyze prob- 
lems by thinking: (1) What am I asked to do in this problem? (2) What 
facts are known? (3) How should these facts be used to solve the prob- 
lem? Another method, less generally used, calls for the following kind 
of analysis: In this problem, I am trying to find the profit; the profit 
depends upon the cost and the selling price; the cost depends upon the 
number of articles bought and the price paid for each; and the selling price 
depends upon the number sold and the price of each. These facts are 
given in the problem; I can easily solve the problem. 
John R. Clark and Leona Vincent compared these two methods by 
having two carefully selected equivalent groups of eighth and ninth-grade 
pupils solve a list of fifty problems. ‘The group that used the second 
method of analysis received the highest score both in correctness of rea- 
soning and in correctness of answers. The investigators believe that this 
method should be studied more fully before its superiority over the tradi- 
tional method can be claimed with any degree of certainty. 
STUDY NO. 30. Myers, G. C. The tragedy of errors in arithmetic. 
Plymouth Press, Chicago. 
We have seen that the chief difficulty in problem solving is inability to 
comprehend the relationships between the quantitative elements in the 
verbally presented problem. Myers believed that problems presented in 
the form of vivid, imaginative descriptions are more readily comprehended 
than similar problems presented in the ordinary brief, terse, conventional 
bookish style. He designed a test containing six problems, each phrased 
in two ways. The two presentations of one of the six problems follows: 
(C) Bertha’s daddy bought her a new string of 100 beads. While she was 
playing tag, the string broke. Poor Bertha! The beads scattered in every direc-
-P-A-G-E-95
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 95   
tion. She caught 48 of them before they fell, but she found only half of the rest. 
When she put the beads on another string, she had only ...... beads. 
(C’) A girl caught only 35 of her string of 135 beads when the string broke, 
and could find only half of the rest, how many beads did she save? The same 
arithmetical reasoning is involved in the paired forms; there is a slight differ- 
ence in the computation required to solve them, though Myers evidently assumed 
that there was no difference. 
The twelve problems, arranged in mixed order, were solved by 468 
persons. In five of the pairs of problems, the imaginative type proved 
noticeably easier. 
This investigation suggests the desirability of describing problems in 
language such that pupils will more easily understand their relationships. 
Conclusion. ‘These investigations of reasoning in arithmetic appear to 
justify the following conclusions: 1. There is a closer relationship between 
reasoning ability and general intelligence than between reasoning ability 
and skill in computation. Consequently, pupils with low intelligence are 
very unlikely, even under the best instruction, to succeed well in arith- 
metical reasoning. Conversely, pupils with high intelligence are able to 
reason fairly well without any systematic instruction in problem solving. 
2. Instruction in the technique of problem solving, accompanied by prac- 
tice, results in increased power to do arithmetical reasoning. 3. The 
factors that seem essential to one’s success in arithmetical reasoning, in 
addition to general intelligence, are (a) silent reading ability, (b) 
familiarity with the vocabulary of arithmetic, (c) the experience neces- 
sary to understand the “setting” or context of problems (d) knowledge 
of certain measures (e) dependable habits of computation (f) ability to 
associate relationships described in the problem with the proper arith- 
metical operations, and (g) interest in solving problems. 4. There is 
some evidence that the graphic method of analyzing problems leads to 
greater accuracy in reasoning than the verbal or conventional method. 
5. Reasoning tests are invaluable working tools for teachers of arithmetic. 
No investigations of the relation between the number of “steps” in the 
problem and its difficulty were found. In general, teachers believe that 
one step problems should predominate in the second and third grades, reserv- 
ing two and three “step” reasoning for the later grades. Very likely, the 
difficulty of a problem, other things being equal, increases with the number 
of “steps” involved in its solution. Of the 488 problems in a widely used 
text in arithmetic for grades III and IV, 404 were “one step” problems. 
and 73 were the “two step” kind. 
A fifth conclusion should be added—namely, that the whole question of 
reasoning and reasoning problems in arithmetic has not been sufficiently 
investigated. 
V. What has Psychology and Experimental Education to 
Contribute? 
In recent years there has been an increased attention to testing by scientific 
methods the traditional conclusions and practices of arithmetic. Many of
-P-A-G-E-96

the studies are too small to do more than suggest a method of final study. 
Others give only tentative conclusions. Eight of the questions studied are 
partially answered by Studies 31-48. 
1. WHAT METHOD OF SUBTRACTION IS MOST EFFECTIVE? 
STUDY NO. 31. Ballard, P. B. “Norms of performance in the fun- 
damental processes of arithmetic, with suggestions for their improvement.” 
Journal of Experimental Pedagogy. December, 1914, Volume 2, pp, 386- 
405; March, 1915, Volume 3, pp. 9-20. 
The author finds a superiority from a practical point of view of the 
method of equal addition over the method of decomposition in subtraction. 
By equal addition the author means increasing the subtrahend in ‘‘paying 
back.” By decomposition he means decreasing the minuend in a similar 
situation. He says, “The main secret of the difference lies in the dispatch 
with which accounts are settled. One. is ‘cash payment,’ the other 
‘credit.. And the postponement of the compensating act increases the 
chances of its fulfillment being forgotten.” For example, “in subtracting 37 
from 85, after taking 7 from 15 the disturbed relationship of difference 
between minuend and subtrahend is immediately restored by increasing the 
3 tens to 4 tens. In the method of decomposition, however, it is the 8, the 
second figure dealt with that has to be changed to restore the balance. If 
the minuend figure is zero, the balancing of account is still longer deferred.” 
The author says further, ‘““The disadvantage of the decomposition method 
is not of course limited to pure subtraction sums; it vitiates all exercises 
into which subtraction enters—long division, for instance—and is, as I have 
abundantly tested, performed in the schools using this method of subtraction 
with difficulty and with dubious accuracy—and yet the decomposition 
method is apparently taught in about two thirds of the London schools. 
“The reason for this lies in the fact that the rationale of the decomposi- 
tion method is more easily understood than that of the equal addition 
method, ‘The decomposition method is ‘more intelligible but its practical 
efficiency is not encouraging.’ ”

‘These articles describe experiments in teaching each of these methods to 
equalized groups. Extremely intefésting case studies are given. ‘The con- 
clusions are: 
1, The method of equal additions in subtraction taught to children late 
in school life, who have hitherto worked by decomposition, produces on the 
whole results in a few weeks and superior in the weaker children, to those 
produced by the method of decomposition: 
2, The amount of gain inyolved does not justify a change of method at 
this late period of a child’s school career. 
3. The method of equal additions shows to decided advantage with 
young children in accuracy and rapidity; and this is true both for superior 
children, who had already learned something of both methods, and for 
inferior children, who, prior to the experiment, knew practically nothing 
of either method.

tive method had been taught for a number of years, 43 students had 
abandoned the additive method and adopted the borrowing method. Of 
175 California children, only 52 used the additive method against 123 
the borrowing method. ‘The respective rates on the Courtis subtraction

accuracy.

After all the students had finished their attention was called to the

used as follows: 
Either, or

or any other method used. 
Out of the 277 cases, 220 used the first method; 23 used the second 
method; 8 used the third method; 13 used the fourth method; and 13 used 
a mixed method. It was found that those using: the way first mentioned 
were slightly slower and less accurate than those using any one of the other 
three methods. But the difference is too small to be of significance, since 
there is no way of knowing how the group using the different methods 
compared in intelligence and general mathematical ability. It may be, for 
example, that more inferior people use the first method.

This study shows that errors may be reduced to a few classes. Four 
or five different classes of errors are responsible for at least three-fourths 
of the trouble which children have. The 30,000 errors made by. 6,000 
children on the Buckingham Problem Test, Form 1, are reduced to six 
classes as follows: (1) Total failure to comprehend the problem, 30 per 
cent; (2) procedure partly correct, but one or two essential elements 
omitted, 20 per cent; (3) ignorance of fundamental quantitative relations, 
10 per cent; (4) errors in fundamentals, 20 per cent; (5) miscellaneous 
errors, 2 per cent; (6) errors whose cause could not be discovered, 18 per 
cent. “About 60 per cent of the wrong answers are due to failure right 
in the beginning to understand what is to be done.”

class who gave the foregoing in flash card drill. Following each error he 
was told the correct answer as “8 and 5 are 13” and was made to repeat 
it after the teacher in that way immediately. 
At the conclusion of extensive researches, Myers concludes: 
1. A mistake is immeasurably serious. 
2. We are never sure that an error once made will not be made again 
and in just the same way. 
3. A wrong answer in number work is apparently just as definite as 
a right answer. In terms of habit process there is no difference between a 
wrong answer and a right one. Errors are not negative entities. They 
are just as positive as correct responses. 
From the foregoing data what we have called drill is obviously a process 
of fixing errors as well as of fixing facts. True drill can be looked upon 
only as repetitions of correct bonds.

Is there a transfer of training in the sense that drill upon the useful 
fractions as shown by the studies of Section II of this chapter, will enable 
pupils to deal successfully with other fractions when encountered in 
equally meaningful situations? 
Knight’s study on this subject is so encouraging that we may limit work 
to situations that are useful and meaningful for the child at the time he 
does them.

the following denominators: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 
21, 24, 28, 30. In Group B the practice was confined to the denomina- 
tors: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The drill material consisted of ten exercises in 
addition, two exercises in the reduction of fractions, and one exercise in 
adding mixed numbers. After the drill period two tests were given both 
groups, involving denominators practiced by both groups and also denomi- 
nators practiced upon Group A and not practiced upon by Group B. 
Findings. Almost complete transfer resulted. Group B solved almost 
as many exercises involving the denominators upon which they had not 
practiced as did Group A. The correlations between the number of ex- 
ercises attempted and the number of exercises correct showed practically 
no variation from Group B with limited training to Group A with general 
training. 
Note. The particular bearing of this investigation upon the social use 
of arithmetic lies in the facts that the fractions in the practice material 
for Group B are virtually the fractions commonly met in business and 
social transactions and that this investigation suggests that mastery of the 
manipulations of these will give the necessary command over the uncom- 
mon fractions if encountered. g

ing in arithmetic. Unpublished Doctor’s Thesis, 1923. Library of State 
University of lowa, Iowa City, Iowa. 
Problem. To isolate, describe, and measure the effect of some of the 
causes of individual variations in general arithmetical ability and the special 
abilities of which it is composed: (a) the special ability to solve problems 
stated in words, and (b) the special ability of computation. 
Method. The author had the teacher rate the experimental groups as to 
attitude, gave them one individual and two group intelligence tests, and 
then used two achievement tests for testing three kinds of arithmetical 
ability—namely, general, problem solving, and computation abilities. He 
then treated them statistically by applying the methods of partial and 
multiple correlations. 
Conclusions reached. The chief conditioning factors in each of the 
three kinds of arithmetical ability were found to be of the same order of 
importance—namely, first, attitude; second, mental age; and third, chrono- 
logical age.

The author states that “when case studies were made of all pupils whose 
accomplishment in arithmetic varied widely from their accomplishment in 
general educational ability, the outstanding feature of the case studies was 
the tendency of pupils who scored higher in arithmetic than in other sub- 
jects, to score high in attitude. The opposite is generally true of the pupils 
who scored relatively higher in other school subjects than in arithmetic.” 
7. WHAT IS THE RELATIVE DIFFICULTY, OR THE ORDER OF DIFFICULTY, 
OF THE PRIMARY NUMBER COMBINATIONS? 
From the curriculum standpoint, this is a fundamental question, and it 
is surprising that it did not become an object of study until recently. 
STUDY NO. 45. Holloway, Harry Vance. An experimental study to 
determine the relative difficulty of the elementary number combinations in 
addition and multiplication. ‘Trenton, N. J., State Gazette Publishing 
Company, 1915. 
Problem. To determine the relative difficulty of the simple combinations 
in addition and multiplication. 
Method. In the first part of the investigation a preliminary test involving 
the 45 combinations in addition was given to the children in Grade I and 
in the first half of Grade II, and a test involving the 78 combinations in 
multiplication was given to the children in the second half of Grade II and 
in the first half of Grade III to discover the particular combinations to 
which wrong responses were made. After the test, the 45 combinations 
were arranged in 9 groups of approximately the same difficulty and similarly 
the 78 combinations in multiplication, in 16 groups. In the respective 
classes, instruction and testing on the different groups in turn was begun 
and continued until class responses of 97 per cent correct on the different 
groups were obtained. ‘Two weeks after beginning instruction on a new 
group of combinations, a test involving the combinations of the previous 
groups was given. ‘Then the original list of combinations was arranged in 
3 groups, and those in multiplication in 5 groups, and instruction was con- 
tinued until the desired 97 per cent correct responses on these groups were 
obtained. The final tests involving the original combinations were given. 
In this portion of the investigation, the number of times each individual 
combination was missed on the various tests given was taken as an indica- 
tion of its difficulty. 
As a second portion of the investigation, to check upon this method of 
determining difficulty, the author gave written tests involving these same 
sets of combinations to a large number of pupils in Grade III just before 
and just after the summer vacation. These results were combined with 
those previously obtained in giving the final difficulty rating of the com- 
binations. 
General conclusions. 1. In the process of learning, each group of com: 
binations, power or method is developed whereby subsequent groups are 
more easily managed.
-P-A-G-E-103
    Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 103   
2. Girls learn the addition combinations with less difficulty than boys by 
about 10 per cent and make 10 per cent fewer errors in the process. 
3. Girls learn the multiplication combination with about 25 per cent less 
difficulty than boys, and make about 13 per cent fewer errors in the process 
of mastery, but boys retain 2.7 per cent better than girls when the whole 
series of products is considered, excelling especially in the larger ones, while 
girls excel slightly in retaining the smaller products. 
4. In the process of teaching the addition facts, fewer errors appear in 
the double numbers even when equal opportunity for making errors is pro- 
vided; the fewest appearing in 5 + 5, and the greatest in 8 + 8. 
5. In teaching multiplication the fewest errors appear in the 10’s and 
11’s and the next fewest in the doubles after 3 < 3. 
6. Combinations in the latter part of the series in both addition and 
multiplication are more readily learned, but they are also more easily for- 
gotten. 
7. From the standpoint of skill in manipulation, difficulty in addition 
increases with the magnitude of the numbers. 
8. The groups showing the least skill for their manipulation are the 
same as those showing the greatest number of errors. ‘This shows close 
correlation between speed and accuracy; greater speed accompanying greater 
accuracy.

addition.” Research Bulletin, Number 1, State Teachers College, Greeley, 
Colorado. 
Problem. To determine the difficulty order of the combinations in 
addition. 
Method. The study was based upon the length of time taken by 20 
pupils in Grades V and VI in responding to the different combinations in 
addition. The 20 children were chosen from the total number of children 
in these grades because preliminary tests showed that they manifested suffi- 
cient variation in responding to the different combinations to indicate clearly 
difficulty differences among the combinations. Obviously, either the chil- 
dren who manifested little or no knowledge of the combinations, nor those 
who knew them so well that their responses to the individual combinations 
showed no variation could be used. Each of the 20 pupils selected was 
given an individual examination on 59 combinations in addition. In this 
examination, the examiner read a combination orally and the child gave 
the correct response as quickly as possible. ‘The examiner by means of a 
stop-watch measured the time intervening between the time he ceased 
reading the combination and the time the child began to give his response. 
‘The average time taken by the 20 children to respond to each of the differ- 
ent combinations was taken as an indication of the difficulty. In connection 
with the individual examination, each child was questioned as to the method 
employed in arriving at the response given. On the basis of the results 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
of these examinations a three-minute drill was given throughout the year. 
At the end of the year these 20 pupils were re-tested in exactly the same 
manner as at the beginning of the experiment. “The second examination 
gave a check upon the difficulty of the combinations determined by the first 
examination. Upon the results of these two examinations a table setting 
forth the difficulty of the different combinations was developed. 
Findings. Some of the most important findings of the experiment are 
as follows: 
1. The easiest types of combinations are doubles, such as 2 + 2; other 
easy combinations are those having one small number, such as 3 + 1; com- 
binations with small sums, such as 3 + 2; combinations with sums one 
more or one less than twice one of the numbers, such as 4 + 3; combina- 
tions with one number an easy multiple of the other, such as 8 + 4. 
2. Combinations with the small number last are easier than those with 
the small number first, such as 3 +- 1 and 1 + 3. 
3. The most difficult combination, 7 +- 9, requires a response time more 
than three times as long as the response time of the easiest, 2 + 2. 
4. Long response times indicate the use of counting or some other indirect 
method of addition. The child who responds 16 to the situation, 9 + 7, 
uses much less time than the child who responds by saying 9 + 5 + 2 or 
9+9—2. 
5. The data of the experiment furnish the following theoretical table 
showing the 81 combinations used in all tests, arranged according to diffi- 
culty, the easiest first:

Method. 1. About 7000 pupils in four school systems were tested for 
the automatic mastery of the primary number combinations when presented 
singly.
-P-A-G-E-105
  Tue THirp YEARBOOK 105   
2. About 3500 pupils in forty-five different school systems were tested 
for ability in connection with the number combinations when presented in 
problems with no time limit. 
3. The first two books of two three-book series were analyzed in order 
to determine the number of times each combination appeared. 
Results. 1. Two sets of tables present the combinations in decreasing 
order of difficulty for each grade. The first is the result of that part of 
the investigation referred to in “1” above, the second is the result of that 
referred to under “2.” 
2. Tables are presented showing the number of times each combination 
appeared in each of texts while other tables show the combinations arranged 
in decreasing order of frequency of appearance. 
3. Combinations tend to hold the same general position of relative diffi- 
culty throughout the grades. 
4, The zero combinations afford much greater difficulty when presented 
singly than when presented in problems. 
5. In general, the larger the members of a combination the greater its 
difficulty although there are many exceptions. 
6. Pupils have reduced the combinations almost to an automatic level 
in addition—then come in order multiplication, subtraction, and division. 
7. In actual problems pupils make the smallest percentage of errors on 
combinations in multiplication—then come in order, subtraction, addition, 
and division. 
8. The coefficients of correlation between the difficulty of combina- 
tions when presented singly with a time limit and when presented 
in problems without a time limit are as follows: Addition -+-.544; Sub- 
traction +.390; Multiplication +.580; and Division +-.022. 
9. Members of “pairs” of combinations are no more nearly equal in 
difficulty than are other combinations. 
10. There are 100 simple combinations to be taught in addition, in sub- 
traction, and in multiplication, and 90 in division. 
11. The number of actual errors in relation to the number of possible 
errors is greater for certain phases of each of the processes than for the 
combinations. 
12. The total number of basic combinations in each of the two texts 
that were analyzed was as follows: 
Text A ‘Text B 
Addition 25,490 28,239 
Subtraction 14,053 11,889 
Multiplication 24,704 29,604 
Division 13,146 11,043
-P-A-G-E-106

13. The correlation between the difficulty of combinations and the fre- 
quency of their appearance in the two texts is negative, the coefficients 
being as follows: 
: Text A Text B 
Addition 452 —.532 
Subtraction . —.329 -.277 
Multiplication —.384 -.465 
Division 421 —.538 
8 WHAT ARE THE FACTS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND WHAT 
MAY BE DONE ABOUT THEM? 
The entire testing movement in arithmetic has given evidence on the 
facts of individual differences. It seems unnecessary to review the data. 
What to do about individual differences is not so clear. But drill and 
practice plans are being evolved which wisely used can provide for in- 
dividual differences in maturity in interest and in ability. 
VI. What Help from Standard Tests? 
Arithmetic deals largely with tool material on a drill basis. Such ma- 
terial lends itself most readily to standardized testing. Standardized tests 
in arithmetic have met all reasonable expectations, although the emphasis 
has been gradually shifting from national standards, to individual diagnosis 
and motivated practice drill. The chief help from standard tests is sum- 
marized in the following: 
A. By emphasizing tool material they have helped in eliminating the 
traditional and useless. 
B. Properly used they have great possibilities in motivating drill either 
for the class or the individual. 
C. They have made possible reasonable norms of performance that are 
perfectly definite and adapted to different levels of intelligence. 
D. They have made evident the facts of individual differences. 
E. They have made it safe and easy to release pupils from further drill. 
F. They have become the chief aid in the diagnosis of the difficulties of 
individual pupils. 
G. For the above reason, they have helped in directing the teacher’s 
time and effort to actual needs of the class and individuals. 
In general, standardized tests make it possible to write drill specifications 
that are specific and definite; to measure the ability of pupils with accuracy 
and to diagnose their difficulties in terms of specific responses; and to moti- 
vate, on a class or individual basis, the entire procedure of mastering the 
drill material of arithmetic. The present tendency is towards the inventory- 
diagnostic tests that shall cover all needed responses and so make possible 
a complete check on arithmetic skill. 
The results for reasoning problems are not so definite or so satisfactory.

VII. What is the Method of Curriculum Determination in 
Arithmetic? 
The exceptional teacher or leader of children can, through the mere 
force of her charming personality and her resourcefulness, lead children 
through almost any difficulties. The type of motivation that is based on 
the personal charm of the teacher, while-no doubt desirable and acceptable, 
is not sufficient. In the long run, the center of interest must be in the 
child or with the child group rather than in the teacher. The problem is 
to organize a course of study or plan of work in which the material will 
be most useful to the child and most appealing to him. There is gradually 
shaping through the force of previous studies, a tentative curriculum-mak- 
ing procedure for arithmetic. 
The following points will be recognized as being drawn directly from 
this accumulating scientific data and experience. 
A. The survey method as explained in the preliminary report of the 
Arithmetic Committee of the National Education Association (Addresses 
and Proceedings of the National Education Association, 1924, pp. 324- 
330) is the first essential in gathering useful material with reference to 
processes to use and in convincing teacher, pupil, and patron that processes 
for which the community has no use may be properly omitted from the 
work in arithmetic. ‘The survey method does carry conviction and even 
in a small community secures enough data for determining the useful 
processes. 
B. Definite standards of motivation need to be set up in order that 
teachers may not proceed with meaningless drill or formal textbook work. 
‘This means: 
1. The basis in actual experience shall be built up before any kind of 
formal drill work is organized or assigned. 
2. The child sees at every step the use and application of the process or 
material on which he is worknig. 
3. The'work at all times is connected with the personal interests of the 
children. ‘This is so important that a teacher is justified in omitting drill 
and other formal work while she takes her class to a cafeteria, to a store, 
to a station, to a bank, etc., in order to build up experience. 
4, The teacher should take time, as necessary, to develop a feeling of need 
for the work being done, and this feeling of need should be kept strong. 
5. Pupil behavior patterns should be utilized by the teacher, so that the 
Arithmetic of the classroom fits into what the child wants to do instead 
of becoming a formal isolated classroom procedure. 
C. The first work in arithmetic is the organization of experience. The 
_ possibilities in this line are well illustrated by Miss Larkin, Number Based 
on the Child’s Experience, in Kindergarten and First Grade, Vol. 2, pages 
12, 72, 109, 151. Miss Larkin made progress with her children in propor- 
tion as she kept behind their experience.
-P-A-G-E-108
    
108 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
D. The next work is a broadening of experience. At this point, definite 
extension of knowledge begins. The curriculum must provide for new 
information for the pupils. Starting with present interests, the children 
must be led out into the larger aspects of business life. This means the 
organization of life situations, trips, the study of business, the organization 
of arithmetic work around large community interests, the use of the school 
bank, the use of advertising from the local papers, in fact it means any 
procedure by which the children are led into the business situations where 
arithmetic is used. This becomes the work of the teacher in either making 
or administering the curriculum. 
E. As formerly indicated, drill must keep behind meaning. Drill is 
important. But drill can be motivated. It can be aided through real 
games. Where the need is apparent, even devices are acceptable to the 
children. If the standards of motivation as set forth in “B” above are 
observed, and, if the drill is confined to really needed and useful processes, 
there is nothing that pays better than systematic drill. Such systematiza- 
tion of drill must become a regular part of the curriculum in arithmetic. 
Merely to indicate the teaching of a process should be scored in future 
course of study as of zero value. 
F. In the upper grades, lists of isolated written problems .should be 
replaced by larger life situations involving business and figuring. Life 
demands thinking in large units rather than the solution of isolated puzzles. 
For example: 
Should I buy a house or rent? 
Can I afford to own an automobile? 
What is the cost of a child to age six? 
What does it cost to clothe a school pupil for a year? 
What are the sources of loss in the grocery business? 
What are the marks of a good investment? 
‘These are samples of the newer type of reasoning situations to which 
children should be introduced. A good course of study will suggest many 
such, and arrange so as to avoid duplication. 
G. Needless to say no course of study is satisfactory which does not 
involve the active participation of the teaching corps, as well as superin- 
tendent, supervisors, and the entire community. If the final product is to 
serve the community it should grow out of the community and its activities, 
as emphasized in point “A” above. But the teachers must help in order to 
insure careful grading and proper articulation with the needs of the children. 
H. Manifestly, no mere textbook outline deserves the name of curricu- 
lum, nor does a mere outline of topics. ‘The modern course of study includes 
in addition to processes, details as to skills and abilities, standards, pro- 
vision for individual differences methods, standard forms for the solution 
of processes, suggestions as to tests and remedial treatment, illustrations of 
good work, suggestions for local applications, a detail of life situations for 
use in each grade. Nor should the curriculum fail to make clear to the
-P-A-G-E-109
  THe Hird YEARBOOK 109   
teacher that the provisions of the curriculum are merely suggestive; the 
teacher’s independence and initiative should be fully protected. 
Comment. The apparent tendency of most of the above studies in 
arithmetic is in the direction of emphasizing local meanings and require- 
ments as a basis for curriculum material, A careful comparison of the 
studies, however, shows that local processes in Texas are duplicated in 
Illinois and Massachusetts, but the concrete applications vary somewhat. 
There is no evident conflict between local and national needs. The con- 
sideration of paramount importance in arithmetic is that of substituting 
useful and significant subject-matter for the old formal grind on indefinite 
preparation for something, sometime, somewhere—that is, substituting life 
experience for verbal memory. In the long run, the best preparation for 
coéperative living anywhere and everywhere is intelligent participation in 
the life of one’s own community. In the case of arithmetic, we are now 
reasonably sure that the general need and the local need are so nearly 
identical, as to give no cause for concern, so long as there is good teaching 
with the use of meaningful material of present and practical value and of 
local utility.

CHAPTER IV 
SPELLING 
Ernest Horn, College of Education, State University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. 
Chairman 
HERE ARE five main groups of problems involved in the improve- 
| ment of spelling: (1) Making the course of study, (2) Deciding 
what shall be taught in each grade, (3) Determining the most 
efficient methods of learning and teaching, (4) Providing a satisfactory 
plan of measuring results, and (5) Determining what text to select, if any. 
Each of these groups of problems contains a number of important sub- 
problems. For example, in making the course of study one must decide: 
(a) Whether or not spelling is to be taught incidentally, (b) What words 
should be taught, (c) How these words should be arranged or grouped, (d) 
How much time should be given to spelling, (e) What, if anything, should 
the course of study contain in addition to a word list, and (f) What should 
be the relation of the course of study in spelling to the spelling which is done 
in the writing required for other subjects. 
The summaries in this chapter are limited to those studies which bear 
on the selection of the words which are to be included in a course of study 
in spelling. ‘This restriction was decided upon for three reasons: first, 
the scientific data which bear on this problem are less well-known and less 
available than those bearing on the other problems; second, since the space 
allotted to spelling was limited, it seemed better to give an adequate survey 
of what has been accomplished in solving this problem rather than to give 
a less adequate survey of a greater number of problems; and, third, the 
committee, in the brief time allowed, was not able to complete a sufficiently 
critical analysis of the studies bearing on the other problems. 
In conformity to the procedure in the other chapters in this Yearbook, 
the various investigations are organized under questions, the earliest in- 
vestigation being given first and the others following in chronological order. 
The questions used for group headings for the various investigations are 
as follows: 
I. What words are most frequently written in life outside the school? 
. In writing personal letters 
. In writing business letters 
. In writing letters and other communications to newspapers 
and magazines 
d. In writing minutes, resolutions, and committee reports 
e. By parents in writing excuses to teachers 
f. In the letters written by literary men 
g. 
h ane 
. In the correspondence of a single individual 
. In letters of application and recommendation 
II. What words are most frequently used in the writing done in schools? 
a. In children’s themes 
b: In taking examinations

I. What Words are Most Frequently Written in Life Outside the 
School? 
Study No. 1. Chancellor, W. E. “Spelling: 1000 words.” The 
Journal of Education, Boston: Vol. 71-2. May, 1910. 
Purpose. To find the 1000 most important spelling words. 
Sources. Lists of words submitted by 500 grammar school pupils, each 
list containing ten words which the pupil thought most worth knowing. 
Letters which the author had received dealing with business, school, 
political, social, and personal matters. 
Number of lists of words submitted by pupils: 500 
Number of letters examined: Not given 
Number of running words: Not given 
Frequencies of words chosen for 1000-word list: Not given 
Comment. The making of the 1000-word list was the culmination of 
a series of studies in spelling made by Dr. Chancellor. For five years he 
had been studying the spelling situation in American schools. He had 
read one dictionary fifteen times and examined two others carefully and 
annotated each for spelling purposes. In this way 400,000 words were 
considered. In addition to this work, he carefully examined nearly every 
spelling book then on the American market, looked through courses of study 
in spelling, and read every available article on that subject in current 
periodicals. Spelling papers, written by thousands of pupils, were also care- 
   
    
        
        
                    
           Special acknowledgment is due to the following persons who kindly assisted the chairman in preparing summaries included in this chapter of the Yearbook. To Miss Cora Crowder for summarizing her investigation; to Dr. C. L. Robbins for summa- 
rizing Andersen’s investigation; to Professor V. A. C. Henmon for a summary of the Kaeding 
investigation and also for a summary of his own investigation; to Miss Annie McCowen and 
Miss Bernice Orndorff for summarizing the studies of children’s themes and for assistance in 
preparing the manuscript; to Dr. Mary B. C. Byrne and Dr. A. D. Yocum for submitting a 
summary of their investigation; to Dr. T, J. Kirby for summarizing the studies by Cessander, Capps, and Lester; to Professor W. I. Tidyman for assistance in summarizing the investiga~ tions of children’s themes; to Dr. E. E. Lewis, Miss Florence Bamberger, and Mrs, Helen 
Gumlick for assistance in canvassing various studies pertaining to the making of the curriculum 
in spelling; to Professor M. V. O’Shea for help in summarizing his study; to Dr. F. S. 
Breed for the summary of the study by Warning. A number of other individuals sent in 
valuable summaries bearing upon other phases of the problem of spelling, which could not 
be included because of the limitations set upon this chapter.
-P-A-G-E-112

fully studied. As a result of this work, he made a list of 20,000 words, 
which he felt no grammar school graduate should miss. Different forms 
of root words were included in this list. 
Dr. Chancellor next sought the answer to this question, ‘‘What is the 
number of new spelling words that an ordinary pupil can acquire?” ‘Tests 
containing 100 words of from four to eleven letters each were given to 250 
eighth-grade pupils. All the words had been taught in class previously. 
The average score was 71 per cent. A similar test which had been given 
five years before to 10,000 pupils showed almost the same results, 72 per 
cent. Dr. Chancellor concluded, “I don’t believe that the average boy or 
girl can learn over 75 per cent of 4,000 words before grammar school 
graduation.” 
The impossibility of teaching 20,000 words to elementary school chil- 
dren brought up the problem of what words were the most useful of all. 
It was in an attempt to answer this problem that Dr. Chancellor made his 
1000-word list. 
He asked each of 500 grammar grade children to write out independ- 
ently a list of ten words that he or she thought most worth knowing. These 
lists were carefully examined in an effort to obtain some guiding principles 
in his work. 
He next canvassed his own letters—‘‘a score or two daily in number, 
sometimes a hundred’’—in order to find what words were most frequently 
used. These letters dealt with business, school, political, social, and per- 
sonal matters. : 
Dr. Chancellor does not state just what methods were employed in 
making his 1,000-word list, but apparently no scientific tabulation of words 
with their frequencies was attempted. He states that he “tried to find 
what words we all need in common.” 
His conclusions were, “These are the 1,000 words that the grammar 
school graduate should be examined and should attain 90 per cent upon. 
These are not only the words he will use most frequently; but they are 
also, according to my finding in the fashion indicated in this series of 
articles, the written words that when needed are most needed, that when 
needed appear indispensable.” 
It is probable that in doubting the ability of “the average boy or girl” 
to “learn over 75 per cent of 4000 words before grammar grade gradua- 
tion,” Chancellor underrated the efficiency of teaching at the time at which 
his article was written. Certainly we have reliable data to show that, 
using modern improved methods, it is possible for “the average boy or girl” 
by the end of the eighth grade to spell more than 4000 words with an 
accuracy of more than 90 per cent.

Comment. In January, 1913, the Division of Education of the Russell 
Sage Foundation analyzed the vocabularies of 2,000 short business and 
personal letters. ‘I'welve sources were used as follows: 
Letters to a firm doing a mail order business 
Letters received by a practicing physician 
Letters to the query department of a city newspaper 
Letters received by a practicing lawyer 
Letters received by school teachers from the parents of pupils 
Miscellaneous business letters to a publishing firm 
Letters received by the secretaries of the Y. W. C. A. 
Letters received by a playground association 
Letters received by a philanthropic organization 
Personal family letters from a large number of sources 
Letters received by a magazine conducting a query department 
A small but varied collection of love letters 
Only the first word in each line was tabulated, or, according to Dr. 
Ayres, about one-fifth of the words contained in all the letters. The 
total number of running words actually tabulated was 23,629. Only 
2,001 different words were found, omitting the names of numbers, persons, 
and places. “The beginning and ending words, such as ‘Dear Sir,’ ‘Yours 
truly,’ etc., were included only in their proper proportions.” ‘The number 
of times various salutations and conclusions were found is given in tabular 
form. 
One eighth of all the words appearing were the three most common 
words I, the, and and. Nine common words formed one fourth of the 
aggregate number of words tabulated. Forty-three words with their 
repetitions contributed one half of the number of words tabulated. Table 
6 shows how a small number of words with their repetitions make up a 
large proportion of the total running words which Dr. Ayres analyzed.

The bulletin contains a list of 532 words which appeared in the investi- 
gation with a frequency of six or more. The frequency with which each 
word was found is given. ‘These words with their repetitions. constitute 
seven-eighths of the 23,629 words tabulated. 
Dr. Ayres points out the fact that “no final conclusions can be drawn 
from this study because it is too limited in scope to warrant them.” 
The chief importance of this study lies in the fact that it was a pioneer 
investigation. No other single study has been so influential in creating 
an interest in research for determining the word list in spelling. 
This list of words must not be confused with the 1,000 words given in 
Ayres’ 4 Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling. The words in this 
scale are the result of the compilation of the data from a number of in- 
vestigations including T'he Spelling Vocabulary of Personal and Business 
Letters. A Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling is summarized else-

Comment. In Part II of The Child and His Spelling, comprising 142 
pages, are presented the results of an investigation of the number of words 
used by a group of adults in their written communications. The present 
analysis deals only with Part II of The Child and His Spelling. 
In the study of the spelling vocabulary, the authors decided to tabulate 
the words used by thirteen adults in their correspondence with one an- 
other. Eight of the correspondents were women and five of them were 
men. Six of them were connected in family relationships. Some of them 
had practically no education, not having gone beyond the third grade of 
the elementary school, while others had graduated from college. Five 
thousand words were chosen from the letters of each six correspondents. 
Forty thousand words were selected from the letters of each of three 
correspondents. Six thousand words were written by one correspondent, 
eight thousand by another, twenty-four thousand by another, and twelve 
thousand by another. The topics discussed in these letters related to a 
great variety of interests and activities. The authors claim that practically 
every matter which would be written upon by the typical adult in com- 
munication with his friends was included in the letters of the correspondents 
who furnished the material for this investigation. 
In the construction of the spelling vocabulary, the authors first tabulated 
separately the vocabulary of each of the thirteen correspondents. ‘This 
was done for the purpose of determining whether the range in individual 
cases differed greatly and what words were common to all the vocabu- 
laries. It was maintained by the authors that in determining the spelling 
vocabulary the use of words by all correspondents should be emphasized 
as against the frequent usage of certain words by a few correspondents. 
If a given word occurs frequently in the usage of a few correspondents 
but if it is also common in the usage of all correspondents, it should play 
a more important réle in the spelling vocabulary than a word which ap- 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
pears as frequently in the totals but which is not used by all the cor- 
respondents. ‘The authors found that certain words, not many of them, 
however, were used excessively by one or two correspondents, and this 
served to give them a prominence in the frequency of totals out of all 
proportion to their actual importance in a spelling vocabulary. 
Four lists of words were finally constructed : 
1. List I comprises 186 words used by every one of the thirteen 
correspondents ; 
2. List II comprises 577 words which were used by most but not 
all of the correspondents ; 
3. List III comprises 2207 words which were used by less than a 
majority of the correspondents ; 
4, List IV comprises 2230 words used by only one of the cor- 
respondents, and 1804 of these words were used only once in the 
entire correspondence of all of the thirteen writers. To put it 
another way, 1804 of the words appearing in List IV were used 
only once in a total of 200,000 words tabulated. 
In presenting these tables the frequency of occurrence of each word is 
shown; then it is shown whether each word appears in one or more of 
three spelling textbooks which were studied in the investigation. Further, 
it is noted after each word appearing in all the lists whether the word 
occurs in the spelling vocabulary constructed by Ayres and by Chancellor 
as a consequence of their investigation of the spelling needs of pupils. 
Tables were constructed showing: 
1. Words which were used by all the women and all the men cor- 
respondents ; 
2. Words which were used by most but not all of the men and women 
correspondents ; ‘ 
3. Words used principally by women correspondents ; 
4, Words used principally by men correspondents. 
Proper names were tabulated separately. 
1. In the total of 200,000 words examined there were 1209 different 
proper names with a total of 9740 occurrences. 
2. In treating the proper names, words that were identical in spelling 
except for a final s were counted as a single word. 
3. Nicknames, diminutives, and personal idiosyncracies in spelling 
names were all reduced to standard forms. 
4. Envelope addresses were included in the tabulation. 
5. Local publications, organizations, streets, and family names, ex- 
cept those of historical characters or prominent persons, were 
excluded from the lists. 
‘The authors determined to see to what extent the words which they 
found occurring most frequently in the material examined were found in 
three spelling textbooks in general use in the schools. It was found that 
65 per cent of the words given in the spelling textbooks did not occur
-P-A-G-E-117
  THe THirp YEARBOOK 117 
  
in the spelling vocabulary based upon the letters written by corres- 
pondents. However, 70 per cent of the words appearing in all the 
spellers appear also in the lists constructed by the authors to constitute 
a spelling vocabulary: 27 per cent of the words in List I, 33 per cent of 
those in List II, 28 per cent of those in List III, and 12 per cent of those 
in List IV are found in the spelling textbooks. No proper name was 
found in all the textbooks. 
This investigation is one of a very few which throw light on the nature 
and extent of vocabularies of individual letter-writers. 
STUDY NO. 6. Ayres, L. P. A measuring scale for ability in spelling. 
New York: The Russell Sage Foundation. 1915. 
Purpose. To develop ‘‘a scale for measuring attainment in the spelling 
of common words.” 
Source. A compilation of the four most extensive studies made up to 
that time “to identify the words most commonly used in different sorts of 
English writing.” 
Number of running words analyzed was approximately: 386,000 
Number of words selected: 1,000 
Comment. Although this study was prepared for the purpose of mak- 
ing a spelling scale, it is useful for the purposes of this chapter since it con- 
tained a compilation of four investigations. ‘The work was begun in 1914 
by the Division of Education of the Russell Sage Foundation. The first 
step was to determine a list of common words. ‘These words were finally 
chosen by combining the results of four studies. 
“The first of these studies was published by the Rev. J. Knowles in 
London, England, in 1904 in a pamphlet, The London Point System of 
Reading for the Blind. The author says of it, “I’aking passages from the 
English Bible and from various authors, containing 100,000 words, a list 
was made of the 353 words which occurred most frequently, and the 
number of times each occurred was noted.’ 
“The second of the studies was made by R. C. Eldridge, of Niagara 
Falls, New York, and the results were published in 1911 in a pamphlet, 
Six Thousand Common English Words. Mr. Eldridge made an analysis 
of the vocabularies of 250 different articles taken from four issues of four 
Sunday newspapers published in Buffalo. He found that they contained 
a vocabulary of 6002 different words, which with their.repetitions made an 
aggregate of 43,989 running words. He reported the number of times 
that each word appeared. 
“The third study was conducted by the present writer in 1913 and the 
results were published by the Division of Education of the Russell Sage 
Foundation in a monograph, The Spelling Vocabularies of Personal and 
Business Letters. The study consisted of the tabulation of 23,629 words 
from 2000 short letters written by 2000 people. ‘The total vocabulary 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
used was found to consist of 2001 different words and the number of 
appearances of each was reported. 
“The last of these four studies was carried through by W. A. Cook 
and M. V. O’Shea and the results presented in 1914 in a book, The Child 
and His Spelling, published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. This study 
consisted of the tabulation of some 200,000 words taken from the family 
correspondence of 13 adults. The total vocabulary was found to consist 
of 5200 different words and! the number of times each occurred was re- 
ported.” : 
In addition to determining the thousand words which are used in his 
spelling scale, Dr. Ayres makes the following comments: 
1, About nine words recur so frequently that they constitute in the aggregate 
one fourth of the whole number of words written, while about 50 words constitute 
with their repetitions one-half of all the words we write. With the exception 
of very, these words are all monosyllables. 
2. At first the purpose was to identify the 2000 most commonly used words, but 
this project was abandoned because it was soon found to be impossible of realiza- 
tion. It is easily possible to identify the 10 commonest words in written English. 
These are probably the, and, of, to, I, a, in, that, you, for. With their repetitions 
they constitute more than one-fourth of all the words we write. Save for the per- 
sonal pronouns, they are essential in writing about any subject, whatever its nature, 
from Aaron through zythum. It is likewise possible to identify the 50 commonest 
words, for, like the first 10, they are true construction words and necessary no 
matter what the nature of the subject under consideration. With progressively 
decreasing reliability the list may be extended to include the 500 commonest words 
and possibly the 1000 commonest, but not the 2000 commonest, for long before this 
point is reached the identity of the frequently used words varies according to the 
subjéct under consideration. 
It should be pointed out that two of the investigations used in this 
compilation deal with reading, and two with spelling. Moreover, 200,000 
of the 223.629 running words of writing vocabularies are taken from the 
Cook and’O’Shea ‘investigation which is based on the family correspondence 
of thirteen adults. It is not strange, therefore, that later investigations 
have shown that only about two thirds of the thousand words of this scale 
are really among the first thousand most frequently used. On the other 
“hand, about 95 per cent of the words are shown, by more recent investiga- 
tions, to be used frequently enough to be included in a course of study 
in Spelling. 
“It is interesting also to note that the available data, aggregating over 
four and a half million running words, bring changes in Ayres’ conclusions 
as to the 10, 50, 100, and 500 commonest words. 
Although this chapter does not deal with spelling scales, it should be 
pointed out here that this 1000 word scale has been more influential than 
_any other study in stimulating interest in the measurement of spelling.

The preliminary scoring was done by pupils under the supervision of 
superintendents and teachers after practice had been given to established 
skill in the use of the method prescribed. ‘The final work was done by 
the investigator with the aid of four trained adult assistants. The tab- 
ulations made by pupils included the following items:

In the final tabulation no attention was paid to the sex of persons writing

Totals | 3,723 361,184 9,223   
Words used only once (3217 in number) constituted about 9 per cent 
of the running words and about 35 per cent of the total number of differ- 
ent words. Incidentally, Andersen found 126 words misspelled two or 
more times, and ten more than ten times each. It is probable, however, 
that many spelling errors were overlooked by the pupils in their tabula- 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
tions. There were few words peculiar to any of the callings represented, 
and these occurred but infrequently. The tabulation by classes shows, how- 
ever, that a really comprehensive list can be obtained only by a very wide 
sampling. 
From a total of approximately 361,184 running words, a list of 3087 
was made by selecting only those which occurred in three or more of the 
six groups and which also had a frequency of five or more. The frequency 
of occurrence and spread of distribution are given for each word. This 
list has been based upon a reasonably good sampling of letters from all 
classes of people in all parts of one state. The method of securing such a 
sampling is the most important contribution made by the investigation. It 
is peculiarly valuable since no selective factor operates to eliminate any 
group of letter writers. The plan by which pupils did the preliminary 
scoring seems to have been economical and quite satisfactory when checked 
later by trained adults. The group divisions did not, as Andersen himself 
notes, yield results that led to adequate or profitable comparisons.

Comment. ‘‘After the lists had been selected, each one was numbered 
and all the words were checked off in a dictionary. The figure ‘one’ was 
placed before every word in the dictionary which occurred in the Eldridge 
list. ‘T'wo’ was placed before each word that was found in the Jones list. 
The other ten lists were checked against the dictionary in the same fashion. 
Altogether, about 30,000 words were checked. By far the greater number 
occurred in only one list, a somewhat smaller number in two lists, and so 
on down to 121 that were common to 10 lists, 54 common to 11 lists, and 
only 9—namely, again, any, believe, look, many, money, remember, there, 
and through that were found in all of the lists. 
“Tt was arbitrarily decided to include in the final list all words which 
occurred in at least six of the twelve lists examined ; there were 1309 such 
words. ‘To this number were added 169 words from the Ayres scale which 
were not among these 1309 words, making a total of 1478 words.” 
The words were arranged by grades by the following method: Eight 
different graded lists were examined—namely, the California and Johns- 
town spellers, Hick’s Champion spelling book, the Boston, New Orleans, 
Richmond, Smith, and Woolfolk lists. ‘‘Each word in the entire list was 
assigned to the grade agreed upon by the majority of authors investigated, 
although in some cases the placing appeared to be pedagogically unsound. 
Some words, about whose location there was an exact division of opinion, 
were placed in the lowest grade mentioned. The distribution was as 
follows: 
Grade II 343 words 
Grade III 408 “ 
Grade Ws 216 
Grade = Ve A18/i0. 
Grades Valea S 
Grade “Vile Ash = 
Grade VEIT 33. © 
Professor Pryor’s evaluation of the graded list is: “Obviously, many of 
the words, such as am, are not properly placed and therefore the list is not 
the best for school purposes.” 
The technic of the investigation is marred by including the Eldridge list, 
which is not a writing vocabulary, and the list from the Champion Speller, 
which is very poor in its vocabulary.1 However, since no word was taken 
unless it occurred in at least six investigations, the results are not much 
affected by these defects in procedure. Indeed, except for grading, this list 
was probably one of the best in print at the time of its publication.

five or more times is given. Words found in this list, but not in the Ayres

that this does not necessarily-mean these words are peculiar to farmers’ 
letters since: they might easily occur outside of the words in the Ayres list. 
STUDY NO. to. Clarke, W. F. “Writing vocabularies.” Elemen- 
tary School Journal, Vol. XXI, pp. 349-51. January, 1921. 
Purpose. To find out whether or not the spelling vocabularies based on 
recent investigations and proposed for use in the public schools, actually 
contain the words pupils in the public schools will need in later life. 
Source. 2000 letters written to the editor taken from the columns of a 
large Chicago daily paper. 
Number of running words: 28,292 
Number of different words: 3,360 
Comment. Mr. Clarke says that in the Ayres 1000-word list there are 
117 common words such as five, rain, hat, top, dress, etc., which should have 
occurred in the Chicago list at least three times, and many of them oftener, 
but which did not occur even once. 237 very common and non-technical 
words such as add, hay, idle, pint, farmer, etc. which occurred four or more 
times in the Chicago list are not in the Ayres list. 108 common words 
such as worse, owner, loyal, rich, etc. which occurred four or more times in 
the Chicago list were not in the lists in the speller. 
He believes that these facts cast doubt upon the reliability of two 
assumptions : 
1. That, because a word occurs twelve times in a few lists of 100,000 running 
words each, it may be expected to recur similiarly in any other list compiled 
in the same manner. 
2. That a list of words occurring twelve or more times in a few lists of 100,- 
000 running words will contain all the words apt to occur in other lists of this kind. 
The author’s conclusion is that present lists of words proposed: for spell- 
‘ing vocabularies are inadequate for the needs of the average person. ‘This 
inadequacy is due, the writer believes, to an insufficient regard for im- 
portant geographical and social factors. “Numerous other like studies 
should be made covering the writing vocabulary of many more people in

widely scattered and representative localities and-of diverse but repre- 
sentative social groups.” 
The author’s emphasis upon the need for more extensive and more 
representative word counts is well-founded. It is interesting to note that 
more extensive counts of letters written to newspapers: and magazines 
indicate that the vocabulary of such letters differs somewhat from that of 
personal or business letters.

The 2,623 words found in this analysis were compared with the vocabu- 
lary of general correspondence. ‘The vocabulary, of each section was also 
compared with that of other sections. ‘The investigator’s conclusions are: 
“Summarizing, this study does not show that the words used in bankers’ 
correspondence apply at all exclusively to the banking business, and yet the 
list is in a certain sense a vocational list. The highly inflected character of 
the words does indicate that those who are to dictate or to type letters in

banking should have more than an average education. ‘Those who are to 
dictate should be able to express themselves courteously and with great 
precision, and those who are to take dictation should be trained accordingly. 
A training which will meet the needs in one section of the country will also 
meet the needs in other sections.”

Comment. This investigation was carried on over a period of two years 
from 1922 to 1924. The separate sources of the words are as follows: 
Manufacturing and printing of advertising specialties 
Mail order business 
Life insurance 
Fur manufacturing 
Wholesale dealers in drugs and druggists’ supplies 
Wholesale grocers 
Boot and shoe manufacturers 
Wholesale dry goods

With the exceptions noted below, all words in the body of every letter 
were arranged alphabetically with the total number of times that each 
word occurred in the whole investigation as well as the number of times 
in each business. As to duplicate letters, only one copy was tabulated, since 
it represented only one dictation. Words of the same spelling but different 
meanings were listed as one word. Plurals in s were counted as different 
words, as were all derived forms. 
The exceptions to the above procedure were the omission of (a) geo- 
graphical names when used as such, (b) all names of persons and firms, (c) 
salutations and complimentary closes, (d) all words of two letters (e) its,

Subsidiary questions discussed in this study are as follows: (a) What 
evidence is there of a distinctive vocabulary for each type of business? 
(b) How much of specialization is observable? (c) To what extent does 
technical terminology color business vocabulary? (d) Is there a diver- 
gence between the vocabulary of commercial correspondence and a compo- 
site reading vocabulary? 
From comparisons between this and other studies the following con- 
clusions are presented: ‘“The vocabulary as found in the investigations of 
business correspondence is of a decidedly general character. It is compara- 
tively simple as to spelling difficulty. There is little evidence of distinctive 
vocabularies for each type of business. A comprehensive, composite word 
list based upon actual tabulations of correspondence is the logical source 
from which to draw the subject-matter for teaching the spelling of business 
correspondence. 
“Matters of style, recurrent phrases, the relative frequency of certain 
words characteristically stamp any one sort of correspondence without 
materially altering the basic word list. One would not confuse the sources 
of farmers’ letters and bankers’ letters in spite of the fact that there are 
relatively few words appearing in the one sort which do not appear in the 
other. 
“The ‘generalness’ of the vocabulary may be accounted for in four ways. 
In the first place, the greater the number of sources we study, the more 
of overlapping there appears between different lists. Words which appear 
to be vocational or technical in one list appear in another list with a 
somewhat figurative meaning or in an original and unspecialized us- 
age. 
“In the third place, the choice of words is conditioned by the most im- 
portant of limiting factors, the man who reads them. By and large, he is 
not a technician. Hence the correspondent writes to him on the plane of 
his interest and in the general vocabulary of the laity. 
“The fourth influence toward a general as opposed to a technical style 
of correspondence is the prevalence of ordering by catalog number instead 
of by name and description of the article. 
“As to the amount of specialization and technical terminology, we are 
forced to conclude that there is relatively little. The various investigations 
show a small amount. ‘There are few words in any one line of business 
which show a technical character when the list is compared with a composite 
list of the several lines investigated.” 
From the statistical treatment given the data, it is concluded that a com- 
posite spelling vocabulary of high reliability for the needs of business 
correspondence can be compiled from the correspondence of various busi- 
ness enterprises. / 
Table 8, showing the divergence between a composite reading vocab- 
ulary and that of commercial correspondence, is here given. “la” indi- 
cates the first 500 words in order of frequency; “1b” indicates the second 
500 words; ‘‘2a” indicates the first half of the second thousand words, etc.

While the tendency of these first five hundred words of the present 
study to appear early in both lists is very marked, it is far more con- 
sistent in the correspondence or Horn list. There is an evident divergence 
between the vocabularies of commercial correspondence and general read- 
ing. However, many of the 104 words not found in the Thorndike list are

probably accounted for by the fact that certain derived forms are not 
reported separately in that list. The closeness of agreement between the 
two correspondence lists is an argument for the reliability of a basic spell- 
ing vocabulary for correspondence that is derived from a sufficient sampling 
of sources.

2. Curtis, Ethel. “A study of the correspondence of a single individual 
over a period of eight years.” 
Number of running words: approximately 5,180,000 
Number of different words: approximately 38,000 
Comment. This compilation was made by combining the alphabetical 
lists of words resulting from each of the investigations given above. When 
the total frequency of each word had been determined the words were 
arranged in order of frequency and the 10,000 most important words se- 
lected. ‘The measures of importance were frequency and distribution of 
occurrence in these nine lists. 
All of the investigations used in compiling these 10,000 words were 
financed wholly or in part by a grant from the Commonwealth Fund, 
with the exception of that by Clark, that by Houser, those in the Cali- 
fornia Speller, and those in 1 h. At the time this grant was made, 1922, 
a total of approximately 800,000 running words of adult correspondence 
had been analyzed by various investigators. By that time, it was clearly 
established that the following words would, in a more extensive count, 
fall within the first 100 words most frequently used. These words were 
not counted in the investigations made under the grant from the Common- 
wealth Fund.

In addition, words of less than four letters were omitted, since such words 
have little or no spelling difficulty, and also proper names of people, places, 
months, and days. By these omissions, it was possible to score a much 
wider and more extensive sampling of adult writing needs than would 
have been possible had all words been scored. 
The total of the frequencies of all words thus omitted, excepting proper 
names, was found in the 800,000 running words which had already been 
recorded. This total made up somewhat more than 60 per cent of the 
800,000 running words. ‘The assumption was made that words thus 
omitted would, if they had been scored, make up approximately the same 
percentage of the running words in the other investigations. An estimate 
of the total number of running words was made‘by calling the number 
of running words actually tabulated 40 per cent of the total number of 
running words examined. It will be seen that the total number of words 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Tue THirp YEARBOOK 129   
in the material examined is somewhat more than two and one half times 
the number of running words actually recorded. 
Because the number of running words is an estimate, all figures are 
given in round numbers, but the exact frequencies upon which estimates 
are based will be printed in the study. ‘The number of different words is 
also given in round numbers. A description of the various investigations 
included in this compilation follows, with the exception of two which are 
summarized earlier in this chapter. 
1. Investigations by the author: 
a. “Vocabulary of Business Letters.” 
Purpose. (1) To discover the words most commonly needed in busi- 
ness correspondence; (2) to discover to what degree specialized business 
words exist; (3) to compare the vocabulary of business correspondence 
with that of general correspondence. 
Source. The letters from 26 different types of business. 
Number of running words: approximately 1,650,000 
Number of different words: 15,200 
Comment. In analyzing this vocabulary, the codperation of Rotary 
Clubs in different sections of the United States was sought. In addition, 
a large amount of correspondence was secured by a personal canvass of 
business firms in Minneapolis and St. Paul by Miss Cora Crowder. Miss 
Crowder’s own independent investigation of business vocabularies is in- 
cluded, as is the author’s “Vocabulary of Banker’s Letters,” the list from 
the California Barrel Company, the list from the Emporium and Hale’s 
Department Store, and Houser, “Writing Vocabularies of Representatives 
of an Economic Class.” 
At the outset the intention was to sample an amount of correspondence 
equal to the relative importance of the business. However, it was found 
impossible to secure adequate amounts of correspondence from certain types 
of business. The investigator, therefore, had to be satisfied with the anal- 
ysis of such letters as could be procured from these 26 different groups. 
It should be kept in mind that this does not mean there were only 26 
different firms which contributed correspondence. Under publishing firms, 
for example, are included letters from 16 different firms. 
‘The number of different kinds of business and the large number of run- 
ning words counted are sufficient to indicate the words which have wide- 
spread usage in various types of business correspondence. The counts for 
most of the 26 types, however, are not sufficient to afford a satisfactory 
basis for making special vocational lists. 
b. “The Vocabulary of Letters Written by Literary Men.” 
Purpose. To discover in what ways, if any, such vocabulary differs 
from that found in the letters analyzed in other investigations.
-P-A-G-E-130
130 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
Source. An extensive sampling of the letters of eight well-known 
American writers and eight well-known English writers. In addition, all 
of the letters given in E. V. Lucas’ The Gentlest Art were analyzed. 
Number of running words: approximately 690,0C0 
Number of different words: approximately 23,600 
Comment. The letters of the following American and English writers 
were analyzed: 
American English 
Abraham Lincoln Lord Chesterfield 
John Hay Percy Bysshe Shelley 
Franklin Lane Lord Byron 
Walter H. Page Charles Lamb 
Theodore Roosevelt Horace Walpole 
James Russell Lowell Robert Browning 
Phillips Brooks Elizabeth Browning 
William Dean Howelis Robert Louis Stevenson 
The Gentlest Art is a compilation of letters of well-known writers. 
Although the only use made of this list so far is to compile it with the 
other correspondence investigations reviewed in this chapter, the data from 
the list will be used to help answer two questions: (1) In what ways does 
the vocabulary of literary men differ from that found in ordinary corre- 
spondence? -(2) Are there discoverable differences between the vocabu- 
lary of English and American writers? It will also be used for the pur- 
pose of comparing the vocabulary of past periods with that of the present. 
The number of different words in this vocabulary is larger, for the 
amount of material analyzed, than in any other type which was scored. In 
fact, more different words were found in the correspondence of literary 
men than were found in any other type of correspondence in spite of the 
fact that only 690,000 running words were analyzed. ‘This may be ex- 
plained in part by the fact that these letters were written over a larger 
geographical area as well as over a longer period of time. On the other 
hand, an examination of the detailed list shows clearly that literary men 
use the language with great freedom. It is particularly interesting to note 
the commonness with which contractions, slang, and colloquial words appear 
ir these letters. 
c. “The Vocabulary of Correspondence of a Personal Nature” 
Purpose. First, to secure additional data regarding the vocabulary of 
personal letters; second, to determine whether the vocabulary used in letters 
varies according to the locality in which the letter is written.

under each division.

Comment. The investigator desired to obtain the vocabulary of highly 
personal letters from each section of the United States. Requests were 
therefore sent to professors of education and psychology in universities and 
colleges in all parts of the country asking that they request students in 
their classes to make alphabetical lists of the words in the letters they had 
received from friends and relatives. “The instructors were asked to explain 
that all types of personal letters were desired—love letters, letters from 
parents or other members of the family, and letters from friends. Since 
the student did not contribute the letters in their original form, but only an 
alphabetical list of words, he could be sure no confidence would be betrayed. 
In this fashion it was possible to get the vocabulary of letters of a highly 
personal nature when the letters themselves would not have been available 
to the investigator. 
Each student in handing in his alphabetical list of words reported (a) 
his name and address, (b) types of letters he had scored, (c) states from 
which the letters were written, (d) approximate number of running words 
in the letters. 
‘The vocabulary secured by this method represented every type of personal 
letter from love letters of engaged people to the ordinary news letter from 
home. It is possible that since writers of these letters were friends or 
relatives of college students, the vocabulary secured is, on the average, that 
of people of a somewhat higher level of education than that secured by 
Andersen.. On the other hand, it seems likely from the constitution of 
student bodies in the various universities and colleges that letter writers 
from every educational level are represented. 
It is probable that words pertaining to education and college life appear 
somewhat more frequently in this investigation than would be the case had 
the letters not been written to college students. A consideration of the 
probable subject-matter of such correspondence, as well as a detailed 
examination of the word list, shows this to be true. Examples of such 
words are fraternity, dormitory, examination. On the other hand, an 
examination of the relationship existing between the writers and recipients 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  
132 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
of the letters makes it seem likely that almost every type of human relation- 
ship was touched upon in these letters. 
d. ‘Letters of Application and Recommendation” 
Purpose. To find the words used most frequently by students and 
teachers in applying for positions, and by those who write recommendations 
for such students and teachers. 
Source. The letters of application and recommendation on file in one 
normal school. 
Number of running words: approximately 154,000 
Number of different words: approximately 5,100 
Comment. The amount of material analyzed is probably sufficient to 
indicate the words most frequently used in letters of this type of application 
and recommendation. One cannot, of course, generalize from this study 
as to the vocabulary of letters of application and recommendation in other 
professions or in business. Many words, such as recommendation, would 
be found in other types of letters of application. ‘The misspelling of a word 
in a letter of application is so heavily penalized that similar studies need to 
be made for other types of professions and business. 
e. “The Vocabulary of Material Contributed by Laymen to Newspapers 
and Magazines” 
Purpose. To discover in what ways the vocabulary of such contribution 
differs from that of other correspondence. 
Source. Letters written to the Atlantic Monthly, to the Chicago 
Tribune, to the Chicago Daily News, and to the Chicago Evening Post. 
In addition, the vocabulary of Clark’s investigation was included. 
Number of running words: 86,000 
Number of different words: 13,300 
Comment. These contributions to periodicals and newspapers were 
analyzed in the belief that those who make such contributions have more 
than average education. The vocabulary thus obtained, like that secured 
from the letters of literary men, gives some indication of the range and 
quality of the vocabulary of people of somewhat superior writing ability. 
f. “The Vocabulary of Minutes, Resolutions, and Committee Reports” 
Purpose. To discover the words most frequently used in minutes, resolu- 
tions, and committee reports.

professional, and philanthropic associations and societies in the United

Comment. This investigation was undertaken after a canvass of a large 
number of adults indicated that the writing of minutes, resolutions, and 
committee reports was practically universal, even though somewhat infre- 
quent, among individuals who have completed a high-school education. 
Many of the words most commonly used in minutes are very difficult to 
spell. An examination of actual sets of minutes shows that misspellings 
are not infrequent. ; 
In obtaining data for this investigation, use was made of the minutes of 
a large number of organizations which were found in printed form. Among 
these are the following: 
American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Associated Advertising Clubs of the World. 
Association of American Universities. 
National Municipal League. 
Daughters of the American Revolution. 
National Education Association, 
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. 
In addition, a request was sent out to individuals in various communities 
in the state asking that they secure samples of minutes from local organiza- 
tions. Returns to this request included two types of minutes: first, those 
from various types of women’s clubs; and second, those from various other 
types of associations, such as commercial clubs, boards of education, lodges, 
athletic associations, and declamatory associations. 
From the amount of material analyzed and from an examination of the 
detailed word list, it seems probable that the important words peculiar 
to the writing of minutes, sets of resolutions, and committee reports are 
included in this list.

Comment. Writing excuses to teachers constitutes a common need for 
all parents. While the amount of material scored is small, it must be kept 
in mind that excuses are short. Except for the vocabulary needs arising in 
special circumstances, it seems probable that this investigation discloses most 
of the words frequently needed in writing excuses. 
‘The outstanding impressions given by these excuses are: that they are 
poorly written, that they seldom show a desire on the part of the parent to 
codperate wholeheartedly with the teacher, and that they are full of errors 
in spelling and in other phases of composition. Certainly no type of mate-

written and so full of errors.

Comment. This compilation was used as a measure of the reliability of 
other lists. It will be noticed that the total number of running words does 
not equal the number of running words given in the summaries of these 
various investigations. ‘This is because very low frequency words were 
not reported in some of these investigations. “The number of running words 
represents the actual addition of the frequencies taken from these various 
lists. The number of different words is based on words actually reported 
in these investigations and is therefore much less than the number actually 
found, 
General Evaluation of the “10,000 Words Most Frequently Used in Writing” 
A few words pertaining to school matters are undoubtedly overweighted 
in this summary because of the large number of letters written to students. 
Words frequently used in business but less frequently used in other types 
of writing are also given a more important place in the list than would 
be justified by the number of times a word is used in such writings as is 
done by the ordinary individual in life outside the school. The overweight- 
ing of such business words is justified because of the fact that spelling errors 
are more serious in a business letter than in personal letters. It must be 
kept in mind that in determining these 10,000 words account was taken not 
only of the total number of times a word was used but also. of the number 
of different types of writing in which it was found. It seems likely that 
the high frequency words in this list are, for all practical purposes, those 
which should be included in a course of study in spelling.

school? 
STUDY NO. 16. Jones, F. W. Concrete investigation of the material 
of English spelling. Vermillion, Univ. of South Dakota, 1915. 
Purpose. “To determine what words, grade for grade, children use in 
their. own free written speech, and what words, therefore, they need to 
know how to spell.” 
Source. 75,000 children’s themes 
Number of running words analyzed: 15,000,000 
Number of different words: 4,532 
Comment. The material used in this investigation consists of the ap- 
proximate writing vocabularies of 1050 grade students, grades two to eight 
inclusive, in four States: Illinois, Maryland, Iowa, and South Dakota. 
Teachers were asked to have students write themes, under regular school 
conditions, and on any topics of interest to the students. Specific directions 
were given to the teachers. The theme writing was begun in the third 
month of the school year and continued until the vocabularies were appar- 
ently completed. ‘This apparent exhaustion of the child’s vocabulary was 
reached by most of the students at the end of the fortieth theme. The 
titles of the themes were then varied so as to reach into new fields of 
experience and stimulate the children to use new words. When a given 
student failed to use any new words for eight themes, Jones concluded that 
that student’s word-well was dry. The total number of themes examined 
per student ranged from 56 to 105. 
The 4532 words reported as found are printed, without frequencies, in 
grade lists. A count was also made of the frequency with which each word 
was misspelled. The 100 words having the highest number of misspellings 
are printed under the title “100 Spelling Demons.” 
Later investigations have not confirmed Jones’ results, but his study has 
had an important influence in stimulating an interest in the study of chil- 
dren’s themes. The number of words is astonishingly small, considering the 
total number of running words reported to have been analyzed. More 
recent investigations have shown clearly that with an adequately stimulat- 
ing list of theme topics one would secure far more than 4532 words in 
15,000,000 running words written in grades two to eight.

Comment. The pupils of the New Orleans public schools were required 
to write on one or more of ninety assigned topics related to child life and 
activities. "The words used by the children of the different grades were 
arranged alphabetically by the teachers and the frequency of occurrence and 
of misspelling recorded. The final compilation was made by Superintendent 
Bauer. 
3037 words having a frequency of forty or more each were assigned to 
grades as follows:

= VIIt Review of the 3037 words. 
“In making the assignment of words to the grades, the 385 words which 
had been used the greatest number of times in the third grade were listed 
as words to be studied by the second-grade pupils. ‘The same method of 
procedure was followed for the other grades except in the sixth and seventh 
grades where the remaining 1166 words were apportioned to the two 
grades.” 
A comparison of the words secured in this investigation was made with 
those given in the study by Cook and O’Shea. It was found that with a 
very few exceptions all the words given in the first and second lists in 
Cook and O’Shea were also found among the words frequently used by 
these children. 
Although Superintendent Bauer makes no pretense of having exhausted 
the vocabularies of the children of New Orleans, the number of different 
words found in analyzing two-and-a-half million running words is more 
than four times as large as that reported by Jones from his analysis of 
15,000,000 running words. ‘The larger number reported by Bauer agrees 
much more closely with what we now know about the extent of children’s 
vocabularies.

Comment. These words recorded by the teachers were compiled by 
the Department of Educational Investigation and Measurement into min- 
imum and supplementary lists of words on the basis of the frequency with 
which the individual words occurred in the lists of the several teachers. 
“In May, 1915, tests were given in order to determine the degree 
of difficulty of each word as shown by the ability of a thousand pupils to 
spell it. In most cases each pupil was asked to spell words from the 
minimum list of his own grade.” 
“The words in the minimum lists were re-listed according to the per 
cent of accuracy established for each word in its assigned grade.” 
Additional words were added to the minimum lists. “Two factors gov- 
erned the selection of these additional words “(1) They are words that 
appear a sufficient number of times in the teachers’ lists to suggest their 
need by the pupils; (2) they appear in the Ayres List, which indicates that 
they are among the 1000 most common words.” 
“The supplementary lists were revised to include words from the best- 
known scientific spelling lists that were not already included somewhere 
in the Boston lists.”

Comment. This study is based on the analysis of lists of misspelled 
words sent in by 683 teachers in 55 schools. The misspellings were those 
discovered in 49,797 compositions written by 16,591 pupils. Only one 
misspelling of a word was counted for a given pupil. 4448 were missed. 
1926 words were missed by three or more pupils. These 1926 words are 
given in the form of a table in which is shown for each grade the number 
of pupils who missed the word. 
While the total number of running words is not given, it is probable 
that -about five million running words were examined. This estimate 
is made on the basis of 100 words to a composition. As can be readily 
seen, the work of recording errors only is small as compared with that 
of recording all words. The time saved in recording nothing but errors
-P-A-G-E-138
  
138 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
was enormous. Since the prevention and correction of spelling errors 
is the purpose of the investigation, the recording of errors seems sufficient. 
In having the compositions written, an effort was made to find as wide 
a range of topics as possible. However, from the nature of the topics 
suggested to the teachers as samples of theme subjects upon which pupils 
should write, one gets the impression that the subjects were somewhat 
limited in type. 
‘The weakness in the investigation is the lack of a well-planned list of 
theme topics which could be expected to sample adequately the written 
vocabularies of the children in the various grades. However, this in- 
vestigation must be counted among the most important of all those which 
have dealt with children’s themes. With an adequate list of theme sub- 
jects and approximately the same technique, the same type of investigation 
could profitably be carried out in a number of public school systems.

Purpose. To supplement previous investigations in three particulars: 
“(1) to determine the second and third thousand: words commonly used 
by children in their spontaneous compositions, (2) to determine the grades 
in which all common words are used, and (3) to develop an accurate and 
expeditious method of examining words in large numbers.”

section of the investigation, omit- 
ting short words and 102 common 
words. 
Comment. During the school year of 1917-1918 the author analyzed 
5000 compositions chosen at random from 150,000 written in 27 schools 
by children in grades 3-9. The general plan of the procedure was to cor- 
rect the compositions for spelling; to cut the compositions up so that one 
line only appeared on a slip of paper; to throw out words of assuredly 
common use; and to sort the remainder into alphabetical and sub-alphabet- 
ical lists until words of the same kind fell into the same pile; finally, to 
count and record the number of times each word was used. The cutting 
and sorting was made possible by having the compositions “written upon 
uniformly ruled paper, usually five-eighths inch ruling, on one side of a 
sheet only. A special effort was made to have children write on the line 
and to space words well.” 
Some of the words were not counted. Since “the purpose of the in- 
vestigation was to determine the frequencies of rarer words, the words 
of assuredly common use were omitted.” Words of one or two letters and 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 139   
a few special words were omitted in all the grades. In addition, “words 
of three letters were omitted in grades four and above, and all words of 
four letters were omitted in grades seven and above.” ‘The names of 
persons and places were not counted. 
‘There is no doubt that the author saved a great deal of time by eliminat- 
ing short words and very common words, even though some of his 102 
common words lie far beyond the first 100 words of greatest frequency. 
Dr. Ayres in reporting his investigation of the spelling vocabulary of 
personal and business letters pointed out that 99 words with their repeti- 
tions made up five eighths of all the running words. ‘The extensive data 
now available indicate that the 100 commonest words with their repetitions 
make up nearly 59 per cent of all the words which one writes. It is easy 
to see that the omission of these common words and all short words saves 
a large amount of time in the final sorting and recording. The bulletin 
gives what the author considers to be the first, second, and third thousand 
words. ‘These words are.also arranged in grade lists. 
In order to select the first 1000 words, the author took the 1254 words 
reported in four or more of the following investigations: “those of Chan- 
cellor, Smith, Cook and O’Shea, Jones, Studley and Ware, and Ayres— 
and selected from these the 1000 words that were found to be used most 
frequently in the present investigation. "The second and third thousand 
words were then determined. As a rule, words that occurred at least 15 
times were placed in the second thousand, and words that occurred between 
5 and 14 times were placed in the third thousand.” 
“In arranging grade lists a word was placed in the grade in which it first 
occurred. The words are distributed among the grades as follows: 
Grade_ III 1,103 
Grade IV 726 
Grade N 578 
Grade VI 293 
Grade<- VI. 169 
Grade VIII 113 
Grade IX 22” 
It should be pointed out that, when one considers the wide range of 
ability in a given grade, “first occurrence” in a grade is a doubtful method 
of grading. 
This investigation adds to our knowledge of the vocabulary of chil- 
dren’s themes in which the theme topics are not planned or controlled. 
The author’s method of cutting and sorting words is a contribution. The 
author’s statement is: “It is not an exaggeration to say that, following 
this method, one can handle words in thousands while by the old checking 
method he handled them by hundreds. In 48 hours the author, working 
alone, sorted and counted 48,000 words, including the eliminations noted 
above.” While a comparison with time costs of other methods of recording 
does not show that the advantages of cutting and sorting are as great as are 
here indicated, there is no doubt that the elimination of short words and
-P-A-G-E-140
  ~ 140 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
common words brings a substantial saving. If the cutting and sorting 
method is to be used, the lines on the paper must be far apart and the 
words well-spaced. The method has not proved practicable in tabulating 
the vocabularies of letters.

McKee, Grace M. Children’s themes as a source of spelling vocabulary,

Purpose. “First, to determine how adequately certain previous theme 
investigations have really discovered the vocabulary which children use in 
writing compositions and, second, to determine whether or not the words 
reported by previous investigations and the words found in this investiga- 
tion are included in such standard lists as the Horn Composite List and the 
‘Thorndike Word List.” 
Source. 180 themes of sixth-grade pupils in 5 Iowa cities and 2 Illinois 
cities. 
Number of running words: 18,958 
Number of different words: 2,329° 
Comment. In order to provide a more adequate vocabulary stimula- 
tion, Mrs. McKee sought to formulate theme subjects which would bear 
on a great variety of experiences with which sixth-grade children should 
be familiar. As a guide in formulating. the theme subjects, she used as a 
starting point Bobbitt’s classification of the values of life. She then con- 
structed and assigned 387 theme subjects grouped under the following 
main headings: 
30 topics on communication. 
28 topics on health. 
21 topics on unspecialized practical labors. 
8 topics on religion. 
16 topics on citizenship. 
20 topics on social contacts and relationships. 
16 topics on general mental efficiency. 
41 topics on leisure activities. 
180 themes were written by sixth-grade pupils upon subjects selected 
from this list. Every word in the themes was tabulated, each word form 
being scored separately. Although but 18,958 running words were scored, 
2329 different words were found. 
In order to compare her findings with those reported in other investiga- 
tions of children’s themes, Mrs. McKee made a compilation of the vocab- 
ularies reported by Jones, Smith, Bauer, and Brown. These investigations 
are described elsewhere in this chapter. She found that there was a great 
lack of agreement among these various lists as to what words children use 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 141   
in writing themes. She found but 1475 words which were common to four 
of the five lists. 
The list of 2329 words was then compared with the word lists in each 
of these investigations with the following results: 
893 of these words were not found in the Jones list. 
1,623 of these words were not found in the Smith list. 
1,154 of these words were not found in the Bauer list. 
1,174 of these words were not found in the Brown list. 
1,099 of these words were not found in the Tidyman list. 
587 of these words were not found in any one of the five lists. 
‘These data seem to indicate clearly that no previous investigation has 
used a list of topics which was at all adequate to discover what words 
a child can use in a theme. This defect probably accounts for the lack 
of agreement: among the lists, as well as for the relatively small vocabu- 
lary found in each in proportion to the number of words analyzed. 
The 1475 words common to four of the five previous theme investiga- 
tions were then compared with the Horn investigation of adult writing 
needs and with the Thorndike investigation of the vocabulary of reading. 
Mrs. McKee draws two conclusions from these comparisons: first, that very 
few of the words in children’s themes were not found in investigations 
of adult writing or reading needs; and second, that the vocabulary of 
theme investigations falls so far short of adult requirements as to consti- 
, tute inadequate preparation for adult needs. 
The comparison of Mrs. McKee’s list with that of Thorndike and that 
of Horn shows that 368 of the 2329 words in Mrs. McKee’s original 
investigation are not in the Horn list and that 758 of these words are 
not in the Thorndike list. The conclusions to be drawn from these figures 
are: first, when the vocabulary of children is stimulated by an adequate 
list of theme topics, the vocabulary of the themes secured more nearly 
resembles that of adult writing than it does that of adult reading or that 
secured by any of the previous investigations of children’s themes; second, 
if children write upon a wide list of topics dealing with every phase of 
their experience, the vocabulary secured will certainly be very much 
greater than that obtained in any previous investigation of children’s themes.

specialized and included little opportunity for the use of colloquial lan-

found in: 
a. Investigations of the vocabulary of reading. 
STUDY NO. 25. Thorndike, E. L. The teachers’ word book. New 
York, Teachers College, Columbia Univ., New York City. 
This investigation is not reviewed in detail here, since such a summary 
belongs more properly to the section on reading. 
This investigation deals with the vocabulary of reading rather than 
with that of spelling. “Io quote Professor Thorndike: “It should be 
noted further that this is ot a spelling list. If it is used as an aid in 
the construction of spelling lists, the derived forms in s, ies, ly, er, r, est, 
st, s, ed, d, ing, and n should be inserted. ‘They may offer notable diffi- 
culty in spelling even when easily read and understood by derivation.” 
And yet the nature of the English language is such that this list affords 
valuable additional data upon the words commonly needed in writing. 
While it is questionable to include in a spelling list a word which occurs 
in the Thorndike list but not in the important investigations of writing 
vocabularies, there is no doubt that a word found not only in spelling but 
also in reading takes on additional importance. This investigation not 
only contributes the most important collection of data concerning the vo- 
cabulary of reading, but also furnishes exceedingly valuable data for 
purposes of measuring the overlap between the vocabulary of reading and 
the vocabulary of spelling.

Comment. Although this investigation deals chiefly with the vocabu- 
lary of reading, the author’s interest in phonetic spelling leads him to 
make some interesting comparisons between his own results and those of 
investigations of writing vocabularies. The book is intended as a contri- 
bution to phonetics. 
The following investigations of the vocabulary of school readers are of 
service in determining in the primary grades the relationship of the vocab- 
ulary of spelling and the vocabulary of reading. These investigations are

Number of running words:. Approximately 200,000 of children of kindergarten 
age; approximately 70,000 of children in the first 
grade; number of running words was not reported 
by those who contributed the vocabularies of indi- 
vidual children. 
Number of different words: Approximately 5000. 
Comment. Many of the 5000 different words which were reported 
occurred but once or twice. In order to secure a more limited list, all 
words were taken which occurred in three investigations with a frequency 
of 15 or more, or in two of the investigations with a total frequency of 
25 or more. This limited list of words is printed without frequencies. 
‘This list contains the words which children understand and use most 
freely up to and including the age of six. It is therefore useful in helping 
the curriculum maker to determine what words should be included in the 
primary grades. It is also interesting to compare the number of different 
words found in the spoken vocabulary of children of not more than six years 
with that reported in the investigations of children’s themes.

Mr. Graham concludes that it is probable that at least half of the 
words “which a child uses in his oral recitations in geography are words 
which he will not use in his writing or find in his general reading.” He 
adds, however, that a much larger sampling will have to be made before 
such conclusion could be finally accepted.

Comment. This monumental work was begun in 1891 after the director 
had presented to associations of stenographic systems the need for fre- 
quency investigations of words, syllables, sounds, sound combinations, and 
letters if systems of shorthand are to rest on a scientific basis. The neces- 
sity for a word count on an extensive. scale appeared when comparisons 
were made of the frequencies of even commonly occurring words with 
varying material. For example, in forty-five sets of 100,000 words each 
the range of frequencies for zu was from 974 in one list to 1959 in an- 
other; for es 278 to 1254; and for er 198 to 1400. Previously published 
word or syllable counts, based on considerably less than 100,000 syllables 
were therefore entirely inadequate. 
‘The research was planned to the last detail. Each word to be counted 
was written on a card by the participants and the cards sorted into classes 
according to the number of syllables and according to the type of mate-  
-P-A-G-E-148

rial on which the count was based. 665 individuals codperated in this pre- 
liminary work. Each set contributed was checked at least once, and in 
difficult sections of the work, twice. 167 codperators then assisted in 
grouping all the original material into unit sets of 100,000 words for each 
sort of literature. Within each set the material was distributed also ac- 
cording to the number of syllables. ‘Table 11 sets forth the summary of 
words and syllables without the distribution according to type of material.

The average number of syllables per word ranged from 2.02 for legal 
and juristic literature to 1.79 for historical material. The general aver- 
age for all material is 1.83 syllables per word. 
The next step was the alphabetical arrangement of all the individual 
words, the card for each word giving the total frequency in the 10,910,777 
words, the frequency per 100,000 words with each type of material, and 
the frequency with the individual sets of material. 
‘The next step was the analysis of the frequencies of each word in 
derivatives and compounds as prefixes, roots, and suffixes. For example, 
the frequency of Schloss when appearing alone was counted and also in 
compounds such as Luftschloss, Kastenschloss, Kénigschloss, etc., or of 
her alone and in compounds such as bisherige, woher, daher, beiher, etc. 
‘The prefixes were written on blue cards, the suffixes on red cards, and 
root words on white cards and counted, being classified also as to the 
number of syllables in each. 
Finally there was made a count of the letters and the frequency of 
various combinations which are matters of special interest in the construc- 
tion of stenographic systems. 
The publication of the enormous mass of material accumulated was of 
course out of the question. The book gives in detail alphabetically and in 
order of frequency the words, roots, prefixes, and suffixes that occurred 5000 
times or more, with an indication of the number of times each was cap-

italized and in small letters. Three words, die, der, and und, constitute 
9.47 per cent of all words. The 15 commonest words take up 25.22 per 
cent of written language, while 66 words make up 50.06 per cent, or 
half, of running discourse. ‘The 320 words which occur 5000 times or 
more make up 72.25 per cent of the word frequencies. i 
Then appears an alphabetical list of the 79,716 words which occur 
four times or more. The facts presented can be illustrated by an ex- 
ample. Leben appears in the list as leben (50) 158/483, which means that 
it occurred 483 times, 158 times as a simple word and capitalized 50 times, 
while 325 times it appeared in compounds or derivatives. 
The root syllables which appeared 5000 times and more are listed 
alphabetically and in order of frequency with figures for the frequency 
among the 258,173 words and the average frequency per 100,000 words 
‘There are 401 such forms. ‘There are also listed alphabetically all the 
root syllables which occurred eight times or more. 
Then are listed the prefixes with all their combinations and a separate 
frequency list of separable and inseparable prefixes. Similarly are listed 
the simple and compound suffixes which occur 1000 times or more and a 
list of all suffixes, final and auxiliary syllables. 
Part III of this stupendous work is a letter count of the 60,558,018 
letters for the 20,000,000 syllables counted. The frequencies of all letter 
combinations are tabulated and classified as to appearance in prefixes, roots, 
and suffixes; complete tabulations are also given of all the vowel and con- 
sonant sounds and all sound combinations. 
The extraordinary detail of the investigation is indicated finally by the 
tabulation of the frequencies of different forms of punctuation in 9,580,- 
000 running words. 
The director met with indifference and open antagonism in his heroic 
undertaking. Financial support was inadequate and very difficult to se- 
cure. Only a portion of the tabulations could be published. All the original 
cards and tables are deposited in the Royal Library of Berlin for the use 
of other investigators. 
‘This study is of great value in determining the fundamental ideas for 
which a vocabulary is needed in any western civilized country. It has val- 
uable uses also in determining the validity of word counts in other lan- 
guages. For example, in the compilation of adult writing needs by Horn, 
the commonest noun was time and the fourth commonest noun was order. 
It was felt that possibly order was overweighted because of its use in busi- 
ness letters. However, reference to the most frequent words in the Kaeding 
list showed Zeit as the commonest noun and Ordnung as the second com- 
monest noun.

Comment. This study was undertaken in connection with an investiga- 
tion for the American Classical League inquiry on the relation of the study 
of Latin to progress in learning French. ‘The question naturally arose as to 
the vocabulary in Latin that would be most useful in preparation for the 
later study of French. Inquiry abroad revealed no word frequency investi- 
gations in French. The sources used were as follows:

Political and military articles and essays.. 25,000 
Letters and Telegrams ... 15,000 
Popular fiction 25,000 
400,000 
The tabulation in the published material gives a list of 3500 words 
which occur five times or more, arranged alphabetically and in order of 
frequency. French vocabulary scales similar to Thorndike word scales 
in English graduated on a basis of the frequency of occurrence found have 
been prepared for publication. 
In addition to the purposes for which this study was made, it consti- 
tutes a valuable addition to our knowledge of the fundamental vocabulary 
needs in any western civilization. A comparison between this vocabulary 
and that most frequently needed in reading and writing English shows a 
large overlapping. Where differences occur they indicate in an interest- 
ing way that where the customs of one country differ from another, a par- 
allel difference will be found in the vocabularies of the two countries.

Comment. This investigation has been carried on over a period of 
seven years. It has consisted in the analysis and recording of the “vocabu- 
lary contribution of each subject and activity, regardless of whether the 
source was game, poem, song, story, dance, hygiene, number, dramatiza- 
tion, drawing, construction, sewing, trip lesson, nature, lantern-slide lesson, 
phonograph lesson, picture study, or what not. Every possible vocabulary 
source has been combed with care to discover the specific word contribu- 
tion of each subject, and the total vocabulary contribution of all subjects.” 
After this vocabulary was determined, further study was made for the 
purpose of determining the relative worth of each word and also the 
relative ease or difficulty with which each word is acquired. 
While the reviewer has not seen the detail of the investigation, it seems 
likely to afford data of value for deciding which words among those of 
known utility in writing may be most advantageously taught in the first 
three years of school.

While this investigation is primarily a contribution to reading vocab- 
ularies, it will doubtless prove of use to those who wish to include subject 
lists in spelling courses of study. If pupils are to be required to learn to 
spell the principal words used in each of the prominent school subjects, this 
investigation should prove helpful by showing the most important technical 
words in each subject.

  CHAPTER V 
READING 
William S. Gray, Dean, School of Education, University of Chicago 
Chicago, Illinois, Chairman 
reported during the last thirty years. A recent summary of 
these studies shows that a large proportion of them contribute 
to a better understanding of the problems of reading instruction and are, 
therefore, of value in efforts to reorganize courses of study and to improve 
classroom teaching. 
When the preparation of this section was undertaken it became apparent 
at once that it would be impossible to summarize in detail in the space 
assigned to the Sub-Committee on Reading even a small percentage of the 
studies which are of value in constructing courses of study in reading. The 
plan was adopted, therefore, of summarizing briefly the results of a large 
number of investigations that relate directly or indirectly to twelve specific 
problems that arise in organizing courses of study in reading. A list of 
these problems follows together with the names of the committee members 
who prepared the various sections of this chapter. M ‘ee THAN five hundred investigations of reading have been

‘The organization of the report in terms of problems has necessarily re- 
sulted in reference to certain studies in several different sections. This 
could not be avoided inasmuch as many studies contribute valuable infor- 
mation concerning several problems. 
Many other problems relating to curriculum issues would have been 
discussed and the results of a larger number of investigations summarized 
in the discussion of each topic, if space had permitted. 
I. Aims of Reading Instruction 
Current statements of aims differ widely—While it is true that the 
aims of reading have been discussed widely during recent years, only a

limited number of scientific studies have been published. The four in- 
vestigations to which reference is made here reflect widely different views. 
Aims as reported by elementary-school teachers—In 1917, Gray? tab- 
ulated the “‘most desirable results or outcomes of the teaching of reading 
in the elementary school” as reported by 715 teachers of a large city. 
The various aims and the percentage of teachers mentioning each follow:

Although these aims include some of the uses of reading in school and 
modern life their major emphasis is upon the traditional values attached to 
reading. 
Aims given in state courses of study for rural schools—Reinoehl’ made 
a detailed analysis of the aims of reading as given in 44 state courses of 
study most of which were issued since 1914. Since less than half of these 
courses have since been revised, the aims discussed represent to a large 
extent current objectives of reading in rural schools. The aims which 
appeared most frequently follow: 
Intelligent interpretation of the printed page with reasonable accuracy and 
rapidity. 
Ability to read (for others) in pleasing, natural, forceful expressive ways. 
Appreciation of and love for good literature. 
Clean, healthy, profitable, enjoyable employment. 
Creation of a compelling desire to read the best well. 
Develop the power to picture vividly. 
For ethical culture and moral development. 
Develop the power of discriminative reading. 
                        
      
  It is apparent that these aims give most emphasis to intelligent interpre- 
tation, expressive oral reading, the appreciation of good literature, and the 
development of permanent interests in reading.

  154 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
A survey of English objectives—The most extensive study of reading 
aims thus far completed was made by Pendleton who consulted seven 
sources of information in a painstaking study of English objectives. ‘These 
sources were statements of 272 teachers of English, statements of 100 edu- 
cators, the articles, editorials, and notes pertaining to English published in 
eleven important periodicals during the years 1915-20, 67 standard gen- 
eral volumes on education, 118 standard volumes about English and the 
teaching of English, 49 state or municipal courses of study or teachers’ 
manuals in English, and 62 current textbooks on various phases and levels 
of English. After the aims had been determined they were ranked in the 
order of importance by eighty teachers of English. Six of the objectives 
which were considered most important follow: 
The habit of reading for enjoyment literature of the better sort. 
A taste for reading books (not merely magazines) of an excellent sort. 
An attitude of alert interest in the world and all things in it and a desire to 
increase one’s knowledge. 
A perennial never-failing interest in people; the habit of studying them sym- 
pathetically. 
The ability to refrain from marking or marring in any way a borrowed book. 
The complete list of objectives include 409 which relate more or less 
directly to reading. It is evident from the examples given that the ob- 
jetives which were considered most important reflect largely the special 
reading interests of teachers of literature. 
Limitations of the reading aims presented—The studies of aims to which 
reference has been made have serious limitations. “They indicate primarily 
what teachers of reading and literature have emphasized in the past and 
what has appeared most frequently in courses of study. They summarize 
current practices rather than seek to determine the most valuable uses of 
reading in school and in modern social life or the changes which should 
be made in the aim and content of reading instruction. They are, therefore, 
of limited value in any effort to reorganize courses of study or to improve 
and refine the technique of teaching. 
Uses of reading in social life—In a series of investigations including con- 
ferences with more than 900 adults, Gray,? Parsons,? and others found 
“that intelligent reading is a most significant means of familiarizing adults 
with current events, with significant social issues, with community and 
national problems and with American institutions, ideals, and aspirations.” 
It was also found to be an indispensable means of attaining vocational

efficiency, of extending experience, of securing a broad outlook on life, and 
of securing pleasure and profit during leisure hours. The investigations 
showed that practically all of the reading of adults is done silently. “Fewer 
than 5 per cent reported oral reading on other than very infrequent oc- 
casions.” Nevertheless, several important purposes or occasions of oral 
reading were mentioned. ‘The three reported most frequently were to 
inform or entertain others in private or public, to increase one’s under- 
standing and appreciation of materials read, and to entertain and interest 
children in reading. 
Uses of reading in school—Gray made a study of the uses of reading 
in preparing assignments in 250 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade classrooms* 
of Rochester and Buffalo and in 250 high school classes? in the central 
west. These studies showed that reading is used for a wide variety of 
specific purposes such as finding the author’s aim, selecting the main point 
and supporting details, finding answers to questions, following directions, 
and securing information to aid in the solution of a problem. ‘The studies 
showed also that the uses of reading vary in different subjects. Judd and 
Buswell® found that changes in the purposes of reading are accompanied 
by corresponding changes in the habits employed. ‘It follows that specific 
training should be given in each important usé of reading and that effective 
habits of reading and study should be taught in each content subject as 
well as during the literature period. 
Conclusions—The studies to which reference has been made suggest 
the following tentative conclusions: (a) That the traditional aims of 
reading fail to give sufficient emphasis to modern reading needs; (b) that 
one of the primary purposes of reading is to extend the experiences of the 
reader, stimulate his thinking powers, and enable him to interpret life more 
intelligently and accurately; (c) that instruction in reading should develop 
strong motives for and permanent interests in reading that direct and in- 
spire thé present and future life of the reader; (d) that reading should 
cultivate the attitudes, habits, and skills that are essential in desirable 
reading activities. “These include habits of intelligent interpretation, the 
fundamental habits of fluent, accurate oral reading and speed of silent 
reading, effective habits of interpretative oral reading, and skill in the use 
of books and sources of information. 
II. Fundamental Habits in Oral and Silent Reading 
The fact has been emphasized that a program of instruction should pro- 
vide for the development of all essential habits involved in intelligent 
interpretation, effective oral reading and speed of silent reading. Scientific

studies have distinguished five such habits for both oral and silent read- 
ing—namely, accurate recognition, span of recognition, rate of recognition, 
the rhythmical progress of perceptions along the lines, and the accurate 
return sweep of the eyes from the end of one line to the beginning of the 
next. It is the purpose of this section to consider the nature of these habits 
and conditions that affect their development. 
Accuracy and independence in recognition—The fact is generally rec- 
ognized that the good reader recognizes words independently and ac- 
curately. Although the pronunciation of words need not be recognized in 
all silent reading activities a reader should be able to recognize them if 
occasion demands. Inaccuracies of recognition in oral reading result in 
errors. Several tabular studies! of such errors have been made which 
reveal interesting information concerning their variety and frequency. 
The most important types reported are non-recognitions, total mispronun- 
ciations, partial mispronunciations, omissions, insertions, repetitions, and 
substitutions. 
The causes of errors or failure? in recognition have been classified into 
ten groups as follows: defective vision; immature language habits; self- 
consciousness and timidity; lack of interest; limited reading experience; 
carelessness and lack of feeling of responsibility; failure to direct attention 
to content; inability to analyze words; a narrow span of recognition; and 
irregular eye-movements. 
The studies to which reference has been made reveal additional facts 
which should be considered in organizing a program of reading instruction: 
Progress in accuracy of recognition varies with the difficulty of the material 
read, with the kind of instruction given, and with the conditions that prevail in 
different schools and school systems. 
Progress in the elimination of errors in simple passages may take place relatively 
early in the grades. 
Schools which eliminate simple errors early make most rapid progress in develop- 
ing accuracy and independence in dealing with more difficult words. 
Schools that develop accuracy and independence early are free to devote a 
relatively larger proportion of time to more valuable reading activities later in 
the grades.

As the difficulty of the material increases for a given class the character of the 
errors changes and their number increases. Furthermore, as pupils advance 
through the grades new types of difficulties are encountered. It follows that the 
teachers of each grade are confronted with the problem of teaching pupils to 
recognize words accurately and independently. Courses of study should provide 
systematic instruction throughout the grades in accuracy and independence of 
recognition based upon the dominant types of errors made in each grade. 
Various methods have been found valuable in overcoming difficulties in 
word recognition. The following were used by Gray' and others in a 
number of remedial cases: directing attention to the content; drill on 
words similar in form until they are recognized as sight words or because 
of their similar elements; drill on phonetic elements, practice in word build- 
ing, and training in the phonetic analysis of short words; and training in 
the analysis of polysyllabic words by recognizing familiar parts, dividing 
words into syllables, and studying prefixes and suffixes. A summary of the 
evidence with regard to the place of phonetics in a program of instruction 
will be discussed in a later section. 
Span of recognition—The amount recognized at each fixation of the eye 
is “‘a very strong factor in determining speed efficiency in both silent and 
oral reading.”* ‘The size of the unit recognized in reading has been meas- 
ured in terms of the number of fixations of the eyes per line. The results 
secured by Schmidt in a laboratory experiment appear in Table 12. The 
entries show that there are wide individual variations and that the amount

recognized per fixation is greater in silent than in oral reading. The greater 
speed of silent reading is due largely to this difference in span of recogni- 
tion. 
The entries in Table 12 suggest that there is little growth in span of 
recognition. ‘This impression is due to the fact that most of the increase 
comes very early in the grades as shown in an investigation by Buswell’.

development in span of recognition comes early in the school course.” 
Evidence concerning the effect of training on the span of recognition has 
been secured by Gray and by O’Brien. Gray gave short exposure exer- 
cises and practice in rapid reading to two sixth-grade pupils, one a slow 
reader and the other a rapid reader. The records of their eye-movements 
before and after the practice period show that training may increase the 
size of the unit recognized. O’Brien® obtained similar evidence from five 
pupils representing the fourth, fifth, and seventh grades who had received 
training to increase the speed of silent reading and to decrease vocaliza- 
tion. The records showed a “noticeable reduction in the number of fixa- 
tion pauses” in all the grades represented. 
The findings which have been reported show that the first four grades 
represent the period of most rapid increase in span of recognition and that 
provision should be made in these grades for appropriate training. The fact 
should be recognized, however, that practice may prove effective later in 
the grades in case it is needed. 
Rate of recognition—A good reader not only recognizes large units at 
each fixation but he also recognizes units rapidly. Schmidt® found that 
the average duration of reading pauses varied from 214 to 470 thousandths 
of a second in silent reading and from 230 to 520 thousandths of a second 
in oral reading. It is evident from these data that some readers recognize 
given units much more rapidly than other readers. They also show that 
recognition is more rapid in silent than in oral reading. 
Growth in rate of recognition occurs most rapidly in the primary grades. 
Buswell’s* studies show that it “is one element of reading which can be 
brought to the level of maturity very early in the school period.” His 
data indicate that a rate of recognition “of from 5 to 6 twenty-fifths of a 
second satisfies the demands of maturity in reading.”

Little specific evidence has been obtained concerning the effect of train- 
ing on rate of recognition. The studies of O’Brien’ and Gray” did not 
reveal improvement. Their subjects were in the fourth grade or above 
and the training provided was not given specifically to increase rate of 
recognition. It remains, therefore, to determine the types of training 
that are most effective in increasing the rate of recognition and the grades 
in which results can be secured most economically: and effectively. In the 
meantime, teachers should continue to make use in the primary grades of 
methods that experience has taught are valuable, such as providing simple 
selections that are highly charged with interest, developing strong motives 
for reading, encouraging much independent reading of simple exercises, 
and providing frequent quick perception exercises. 
Rhythmical progress of perceptions—Huey® early observed that “readers 
showed a strong rhythmic tendency. Each would fall into a reading pace 
that seemed most natural to him, and would read page after page in almost 
exactly the same time.” Later experiments of Dearborn, Schmidt, Gray, 
Buswell, and Judd confirm Huey’s observations. 
Irregularity in the progress of perceptions has been measured in terms 
of the number of regressive movements per line. In an analysis of the 
causes of regressive movements, Buswell* discovered four types produced by 
as many different causes. They are (a) irregularities at the beginning of 
lines due to inaccurate return sweeps, (b) irregularities on the part of 
mature readers who overreach their maximum span of recognition, (c) 
lack of word knowledge, and (d) “periods of confusion.” Judd and Bus- 
well® discovered the following additional causes: increase in difficulty of 
material read, changing from more familiar to less familiar content, and 
changing the purpose of reading, for example, from rapid reading to study. 
Few efforts have been made to promote the rhythmical progress of per- 
ceptions or to eliminate regressive movements through specific training ex- 
ercises, excepting in remedial cases.° The latter type of studies shows that

training which increases the span of recognition and speed of reading also 
improves the regularity of eye-movements. Other studies show indirectly 
that training which increases accuracy and fluency in oral reading and 
speed in interpreting what is read are equally beneficial. 
Accurate return sweeps—Practically all eye-movement studies reveal the 
fact that the good reader moves his eyes quickly from the end of one line 
to the beginning of the next. The error of the poor reader is to make the 
first fixation on a line too far to the right. The child gains his first idea of 
the return sweep as the teacher writes sentences on the board for him 
to read or as she points to the lines.on a chart. Most pupils form right 
habits without additional help. It is only in remedial cases that special 
help is necessary. In one such case,' the lines were typewritten about an 
‘inch apart. The subject was instructed to move his eyes quickly from the 
end of one line to the beginning of the next without stopping to look at 
words on the second line. Ten five-minute practice periods proved very 
effective as shown by his subsequent reading record. 
Conclusion—The studies to which reference has been made emphasize 
the importance of the fundamental habits in oral and silent reading. Defi- 
nite provision should be made throughout the grades for systematic training 
in habits of accuracy and independence of word recognition. Specific pro- 
vision should be made in the primary grades for the development of span 
of recognition and rate of recognition and for remedial training later in 
the grades, if needed in individual cases. Regular progress of perceptions 
along the lines and accuracy of return sweeps are promoted by the teacher 
in early reading activities. Little specific training is required later except- 
ing in remedial cases. Important as these habits of recognition are, they 
should never be emphasized at the sacrifice of intelligent interpretation. 
They are a means to an end and not the primary goal of reading instruction. 
III. Growth Periods cr Rates of Progress in Important Phases of 
Reading 
Studies of progress in reading have revealed a number of interesting facts 
for the practical school man. In general these studies bring out the fact that 
progress in reading is much slower than need be. Experimental studies have 
usually shown that it is possible to bring about a decided improvement in 
reading in a relatively short time if one will but apply the proper remedies. 
Whether such rates of improvement could be made to continue over a long 
period or whether improvement under experimental conditions is large be- 
cause appropriate methods have been tried on many children whose reading 
was at a low level is impossible to say definitely.

Improvement in rate of reading—The average rate of silent reading for 
children trained under ordinary conditions when material of the usual type 
is used to test them, as shown by the averages of figures collected by several 
investigators, is approximately as follows:

1 Figures for grades II and III represent averages of data secured by Courtis, Gray, and 
Starch and reported in the Gary Survey. ures for the remaining grades represent ‘aver- ages of six investigations cited by O’Brien: Silent reading, p. 203. 
    Some of the earlier investigations indicated that the largest gains in rate 
are made below the fourth grade and that there is little gain beyond 
the fifth grade, a matter which has been attributed by some to the change in 
character of the reading demands made upon the child at about that time.’ 
O’Brien’s more recent and extensive experiment shows that marked growth 
in rate of silent reading may continue in all elementary grades under proper 
training (See Table 14). He conducted an experiment with approximately 
1200 children. The experimental group was given daily training in rapid 
silent reading followed by reproduction of what was read during the regular 
reading period for 39 school days. The control group carried on the regular 
work in reading. At the end it was found that the group which received the 
training in speed increased 56 per cent in rate as compared with 25 per cent 
for the control pupils and made a marked gain in comprehension as well. 
O’Brien concluded that present average rates in reading in grades III to 
VIII are needlessly slow and inefficient and that they can be improved by 
systematic training without any impairment of comprehension, if special 
stress is placed upon that point.? Gates in the period from November to 
May produced an improvement in rate of silent reading in grades III to 
VIII averaging above 2.7 years by using a variety of devices for encouraging 
rate and comprehension. 
Improvement in comprehension—There is evidence to show that the rate 
of progress in comprehension through the grades under ordinary conditions 
is much lower than necessary. “The various reports of individual case studies 
show that for many children at least progress in reading under usual teach- 
ing conditions is far from ideal. With few exceptions in these individual

case studies an improvement of from one to several years’ progress in a few 
months’ time resulted from proper diagnosis and appropriate training.’ 
In some instances, both comprehension and rate have been more than 
doubled. The studies of Uhl and Reichert indicate that comprehension 
scores may be materially increased in short periods of from two to six weeks’ 
training. Uhl secured marked improvement in comprehension with daily 
drill periods of fifteen minutes for pupils who showed marked defects. The 
group of pupils in each grade who were drilled individually gained, in all 
but a few instances, more than double that of the groups who were not 
drilled.? Reichert by six weeks of carefully supervised instruction in one 
class secured a gain in comprehension double that made. in two control 
classes. In the supervised class a diagnostic study of individual needs was 
made and pupils were grouped and given the sort of training which the di- 
agnosis showed they needed.* The improvement obtained by Gates in grades 
III to VIII from November to May amounted to one and one-half years 
as measured by the Thorndike-McCall test. On the basis of intelligence 
quotients the expected improvement would have been but 1.17 years.* Thei- 
sen’s study indicates that when pupils are sectioned on the basis of ability the 
brighter classes make progress far in excess of normal expectancy.® In Haw- 
ley’s study in which pupils of the fifth and sixth grades were given twenty 
weeks’ training for the sole purpose of improving quality, there was an actual 
increase of 43 per cent in the second test over the first. Although no attention 
was directed toward the improvement of oral reading, the children actually 
improved in that phase of reading five times as much as they normally would 
in the same period of time. Even though some slight allowance must be

made for familiarity with the tests in both silent and oral reading the 
progress made was considerably more than would normally be expected in 
the course of an entire year.* 
Improvement in oral and silent reading processes—Buswell’s investiga- 
tions show that there is a rapid increase in eye span, in rate of recognition of 
words, and in the regular progress of perception along the lines in the first 
four grades in both silent and oral reading. ‘Thereafter progress continues 
less rapidly, a fact which he attributed largely to changes in the character of 
the materials read after the fourth grade. His records reveal a high correla- 
tion between progress in these elements of reading and in word recognition. 
“As the reader develops in span of recognition, rate of recognition and regu- 
larity of procedure along the printed lines, he also becomes more mature in 
the elements which are measured by the oral test, such as repetitions, omis- 
sions, substitutions, insertions, and mispronunciations.”” 
Some of the analytical studies of children’s reading give rise to pertinent 
questions concerning the relative emphasis to be placed upon oral and silent 
reading. One contention is that when the child’s reading has developed to 
a point where the rate of silent reading begins to exceed the rate of articula- 
tion the major emphasis in reading should be changed. In the first three 
grades, the rate of articulation appears to be greater than the rate of recogni- 
tion. Under ordinary conditions, however, the rate of recognizing words 
increases rapidly and surpasses the rate of articulation by the time the fourth 
grade is reached. ‘There is no evidence to show that the rate of recognition 
would not surpass the rate of articulation even earlier were children given 
suitable training in silent reading in the first few years of school. Owing 
to the fact that the rate of oral reading cannot exceed the rate of articula- 
tion and that articulation increases relatively little from grade to grade, the 
rate of oral reading increases much less rapidly than the rate of silent read- 
ing and lags far behind it by the time the upper grades are reached.? The 
“stumbling” of fourth grade pupils who were good oral readers in the lower 
grades is attributed to the fact that the rate of recognition far exceeds the 
rate of articulation. Professor Judd maintains that such facts as these are

evidence of the need of placing the major emphasis upon silent reading from 
the fourth grade on.t_ Subsequent studies may show that it should receive 
major emphasis even below the fourth grade. 
Hindrances to progress—The hindrances to progress are legion. It is 
impossible to tell even approximately how much each is responsible for un- 
satisfactory progress. Among some of the more evident causes of unsatisfac- 
tory progress are the following: (1) Lack of definite goals of attainment. 
The teacher who understands exactly what is expected of her pupils and 
when to expect it will probably achieve her objectives much more quickly 
than the one who does not. (2) Low intelligen¢ée. The Cleveland study 
showed that the median achievement of 17 first-grade classes in the slowest 
group at the end of the year as measured by the Haggerty Tests was from 
three fourths to one year lower than that of the median of the 16 classes in 
the brightest group. The best class in the slow group, however, exceeded 
by far the poorest class in the bright group, showing that lower intelligence 
does not always mean slower progress in reading.” (3) The use of material 
that is too difficult, lacking in variety, or insufficient in quantity. (4) Mass 
treatment and failure to provide for individual differences in ability. (5) 
Undue emphasis upon oral reading. Oral reading as usually practiced is 
exceedingly wasteful. If a pupil is one of twenty, he waits for his one op- 
portunity in twenty to read. The teacher commonly insists that he follow 
closely the one who is reading, thus denying him an opportunity to use or 
employ his time to better advantage. ‘This insistence that the pupil follow 
the reader, Judd maintains, “tends to keep all children down in their silent 
reading to the rate set by the oral reading emphasized in the schools.’* (6) 
Vocalization or lip reading. The effect of vocalization is to retard the 
development of speed.? Absence of vocalization is a characteristic of the 
mature reader.t. (7) Lack of early training or lack of development in some 
essential element of reading ability. Children may be retarded in their read- 
ing development because of something neglected in their previous training as, 
for example, phonics or practice in phrasing.* (8) Fixed attitudes or habits 
of reading. A child who looks upon reading as a matter of pronouncing 
words is likely to experience difficulty in getting meaning. The more a 
pupil’s habits bécome fixed the more difficult it is to secure improvement.!

(9) Failure to change to other methods when those in use are no longer 
appropriate. Methods suitable with young children are frequently in- 
appropriate with older children. (10) Lack of interest and mental stimula- 
tion. Children whose interests are not aroused or who are allowed to 
dawdle along at a slower pace than they are capable of going are not likely 
to make rapid progress.! (11) Home language and standards. (12) Un- 
trained teachers and absence of proper supervision. Relatively few teachers 
have had modern training in the teaching of reading. Without a well- 
trained supervisor to guide them the teaching falls far short of its possi- 
bilities. (13) Physiological handicaps of hearing and eyesight. 
Aids to progress—An understanding of the causes of slow progress fre- 
quently suggests the remedy. Most of the causes listed in the paragraph 
above are fairly easy to remedy if teachers and school officials will but 
direct their attention to them. Among the steps to be taken are: (1) A 
careful analysis of objectives and the setting-up of standards of attainment ; 
(2) improvement in the choice of reading materials; (3) adequate pro- 
vision for individual differences; (4) more emphasis upon silent reading; 
(5) removal of special difficulties; (6) development of appropriate reading 
attitudes; (7) choice of methods suitable to the age and development of the 
child; (8) greater attention to interest and mental effort; (9) training of 
teachers in modern methods of teaching reading and improved supervision, 
and (10) treatment of physical defects. 
IV. Children’s Interests in Reading 
Definite progress has been made in discovering the reading materials 
which make the strongest appeal to children, the factors in these materials 
which appeal to children’s interests, and the types of material which should 
be avoided if the time devoted to reading is to be spent to best advantage. 
Most of the investigations concerning these matters are referred to in more 
or less detail in other sections of the report of the Sub-committee on Reading. 
It is proposed at this point to describe briefly the methods employed in the 
study of children’s interests in reading and to direct attention to certain 
general conclusions which these studies justify. 
One of the distinguishing characteristics of the more recent studies” 
is the fact that the preferences or judgments of children received careful

consideration. In the case of younger children this information was ob- 
tained by having them express choices between pairs of selections read to 
them. Older pupils wrote answers to carefully prepared questionnaires and 
took comprehension tests. Both their school and home reading was checked 
in this way. Careful observations were also made of children’s library 
choices and reports were obtained from publishers showing sales of children’s 
books. Great care was taken to obtain spontaneous responses of children’s 
preferences rather than answers which they thought would please the 
teachers. The judgments and experiences of teachers with reading materials 
were checked and rechecked by questionnaires, making available facts which 
should have wide influence upon the selection and gradation of reading 
materials. 
Among the factors appealing most strongly to young children’ are surprise 
and plot. In addition, boys are attracted by animalness and girls by childness 
and familiar experience. Older pupils? are intelligently responsive to inter- 
esting action, characters, and problems which challenge their thinking. Sex 
differences appear between the ages of ten and thirteen, boys being most in- 
terested in stories of heroism and adventure, and girls in home and school 
situations, especially those portraying kindness. However, adventure and 
humor, kindness, faithfulness, and loyalty always make strong appeals to 
older pupils. 
The factors? most to be avoided are over-maturity, too great difficulty, 
and hard symbolism. ‘There is no question but that certain selections have 
long been imposed on children before they were prepared for them. Many 
of the difficulties of teachers have arisen because they have been expected to 
teach materials of too great difficulty to their pupils. Recent investigations 
point the way to wise elimination of certain selections which have become 
traditional. 
An appeal for a greater variety of interesting factual material for pupils 
of all grades grows out of the discovery* of the varied interests of children 
and of the poverty of well-written material suited to those interests. At 
the same time children’s dislike of selections “written down” for them is 
evident. Questions arise also concerning the need for a common core of 
literary material which all elementary pupils shall read and concerning the 
need for standards by which literary materials may be evaluated and selec- 
tions appropriate for use in the various grades chosen.

V. Results of Investigations of Reading Materials 
The results of investigations of reading materials can be discussed in 
terms of five problems—namely, types of content in readers, the duplication 
of reading material, the effect of increasing difficulty in speed and quality of 
reading, the importance of growth stages, and types of desirable reading 
materials. 
Types of content in readers.. Vinal+ examined “thirty-three of the best 
and most used first readers” and reported upon them in 1918. His purpose 
was to find out how much factual scientific material these books contained. 
He found that “over 50 per cent of the stories in these readers are about 
animals. Only 33 per cent of these animal stories are true to nature. The 
other 66 per cent are either fables or personifications where animals act and 
talk as human beings. For every five animal stories, there is one plant story 
and one geography story, such as: The wind, the rain, or the Eskimo. .. . 
The cat is written about more than any other animal. Out of thirty-eight 
cat stories fourteen are of the fairy type, fourteen are about cats who talk 
as human beings, and ten are true to cats and their doings.” Most of the 
stories of cats which are true are of the following style: “See mamma. See 
kitty. Mamma, see kitty.” Vinal summarized his results by saving that 
first-grade readers should contain more selections which portray the every- 
day activities of animals or facts about nature. 
Starch? conducted an investigation to determine, first, to what extent 
current textbooks in reading agree or differ as to the nature of the material 
and as to specific selections included; and second, to what extent there are 
changes in the nature of the material from grade to grade. With these 
aims in view he analyzed the contents of ten textbooks in each elementary 
school grade and classified them under sixteen different headings. Eighty- 
three books from twenty-three different sets or series were included in the 
study. The analysis revealed wide differences in types of content for lower- 
grade and upper-grade books. For example, the three leading types in the 
first-grade books studied are “animals,” “boys and girls,” and “folklore.” 
‘These constitute 61 per cent of the content of first-grade books, while they 
constitute only 3.7 per cent of the eighth-grade books. On the other hand, 
“classics,” “history and patriotism,” “biography,” and “poetry” constitute 
81.7 per cent of the content of the eighth-grade books, but only 16.7 per 
cent of the first-grade books. He found also that with the exception of 
“classics” and “history and patriotism” one or more fourth-grade books 
omitted each of the sixteen classes of content. ‘The amount of overlapping 
common to three or more of the ten sixth readers examined is very small.

One poem, Horatius at the Bridge, was, however, found in six of the ten 
readers. Two selections, The Chambered Nautilus and The Daffodils, 
were found in four readers, five in three readers, and eighteen in two 
readers. 
Herriott! attempted to ascertain the extent of the shift of emphasis in 
readers for Grades VII to VIII from social science content to purely literary 
content. To do this he analyzed the seventh- and eighth-grade books of 
five series of readers which are now in use. He found that, with the excep- 
tion of one series, every seventh reader contains more social science content 
than does its corresponding eighth reader. ‘There is a corresponding increase 
in pure literature in all except one of the eighth readers. This change in 
emphasis indicates a tendency in the eighth grade toward the traditional 
work of high school. 
Duplication of reading material—Stone® analyzed the contents of fifteen 
second-grade readers to discover the amount of duplication of subject-matter. 
‘The books selected represent method and content readers, extreme and con- 
servative, real and unreal. Their dates of publication varied from 1906 to 
1916. Although he found little exact duplication save in poetry, he did 
find that stories were virtually duplicated in many books. The range in 
amount of duplication was from 0 to 41 selections. In terms of pages, the 
amount of duplication varied from 0 to 121. A total of seventy-seven selec- 
tions were duplicated in the fifteen readers. . 
The duplication of a few second-reader selections in books for other 
grades was investigated. It was found that one selection, The Ugly Duck- 
ling, appeared in three of fifteen third-grade books. Where duplication 
existed within a grade, there was evidence of agreement as to grading, but 
the duplication of selections in books for use in different grades indicated 
failure to grade carefully. In a later paragraph of this section of the chap- 
ter, namely, the importance of growth stages, the duplication of content is 
further discussed. 
Effect of decreasing difficulty. McLeod® set for himself the task of 
ascertaining the effect of increasing difficulty of reading material upon 
rate, types of errors made, and the degree of comprehension. He tested 
approximately 30 pupils of each grade from the first to the eighth by 
having them read Gray’s Standardized Reading Paragraphs according to 
directions. As a test of comprehension, five questions were asked following 
the reading of each paragraph. “These questions were given a score value

of 20 each and grades 5, 10, 15, or 20 according to the degree of correct- 
ness. 
He found that the rate increases rapidly in Grades I and II and then 
more slowly until Grade VI. Plateaus in the curve of progress occur from 
Grades III to V and from Grades VI to VIII. In Grades I and II the 
rate of reading is slow, but from Grade III upward the rate of recognition 
is in advance of the rate of vocalization for paragraphs 1 to 4, This is 
explained by the fact that in Grades I and II, the child is learning to 
associate printed symbols with words already spoken. When Grade III is 
reached, the reading vocabulary probably overtakes the spoken vocabulary. 
At this stage the learning of new words in difficult passages retards the rate 
of oral reading. 
The types of errors recorded in McLeod’s article are mispronunciations, 
omissions, substitutions, insertions, and repetitions. Of these, mispronunci- 
ations were the most common in every grade save the second. Gross mis- 
pronunciations were particularly prominent in the reading of difficult pas- 
sages. Of the substitutions, it was found that the percentage with “no 
meaning” increased with the difficulty of the passages: “As the reading 
becomes more difficult, the thought is lost in the maze of difficult words, 
and substitutions are very largely on the basis of similarity in appearance in 
some respect, rather than on the basis of thought-suggestion.” 
Comprehension was impeded by the new words met in the more difficult 
paragraphs. The results indicate that pupils acquire ability to pronounce 
words more rapidly than ability to derive their meanings. The test records 
show that the child’s meaning vocabulary was frequently exhausted by the 
time the more difficult paragraphs of the test were reached although the 
pupil’s mastery of the mechanics of reading enables him to continue to 
pronounce the words. 
The importance of growth stages—Uhl! attempted to derive standards 
for grading selections. The following outline shows the procedure used 
in obtaining the reactions of teachers and pupils to reading matter: 
Reactions from teachers: Analytical questions on the content of basal readers; 
Classified lists of titles of selections sent to teachers for their comments. 
Reactions from pupils: Representative selections presented directly to pupils 
who read them silently and reported in writing whether they liked or disliked 
each selection and why; Pupils’ comprehension of the selections measured by 
questions on the selections.

Judgments concerning the value of several thousand reading selections 
were obtained from over 3000 selected teachers of Grades I to VIII in- 
clusive. As a check upon teachers’ judgments, tests based on certain 
standard selections were given to 529 pupils of Grades III to VIII. Meas- 
ures were obtained of the pupils’ interest in and comprehension of each selec- 
tion. 
An analysis of the responses of teachers shows that scores of selections are 
duplicated in the courses of study of different grades just as the statistical 
studies already reviewed lead one to expect. These responses show also 
that the success of a selection often depends upon the grade in which it 
is read. For example, The Pied Piper of Hamlin, in various versions was 
reported for Grades II to VII inclusive, in different cities, while other 
selections, The Ugly Duckling and The Village Blacksmith, recur in dif- 
ferent books until pupils are alleged to tire of them. Responses to ques- 
tionnaires show that children thus re-read certain selections instead of 
extending their acquaintance with other selections or books. 
Three significant types of misplacement of selections were discovered. 
‘These types are exemplified by selections which gain in favor from grade 
to grade, selections which decline in favor from grade to grade, and selec- 
tions which are unpopular in any grade because of their difficulty. Over 
difficult selections were reported more frequently than those of both the 
other types combined. Selections representing each type, together with the 
percentages of gain or loss in favor from grade to grade, are cataloged 
in the reports of this investigation. For example, the percentage of teach- 
ers approving Christmas at the Cratchits’ increases from 73 in Grade IV 
to 98 in Grade VIII, and the percentage of pupils approving increases 
from 81 in Grade IV to 90 in Grade VIII. 
Only a very few times were given selections found to be successful in 
only one grade, In other words, if a selection is highly desirable for any 
given grade, it is likely to be a favorite in at least one additional grade. The 
placement of a selection in a single grade often depends, therefore, upon 
some consideration other than its difficulty, such as the academic standards 
of a given school, the social value of the selection, or its relation to other 
school work. 
Significant positive correlations were found between pupils’ interests in 
and comprehension of selections. Certain selections were, however, readily 
comprehended, although specific undesirable qualities prevented their being 
entirely successful in any grade. Conversely, a few selections which con- 
tained superior interest qualities were favored by pupils whose compre- 
hension scores for them were low. 
Teachers’ and pupils’ judgments also show significant positive correla- 
tions, although teachers generally rate selections slightly higher than pupils 
do. In view of the increase in pupil interest after a single class discussion, 
the higher rating by teachers seems to be justified. When the compre- 
hension scores of different schools were compared, a variability of two or
-P-A-G-E-171
  Tue THirp YEARBOOK 171   
more grades was found for different selections—for example, in answer- 
ing questions based on Paul Revere’s Ride, fifth-grade pupils of one school 
excelled seventh-grade pupils of another school. 
Analyses of the comments of teachers and pupils of different grades show 
that pupils have varying reasons for interest in selections. Such qualities 
as personification of animals and repetition add to the interest of primary 
pupils, while pupils in the later grades seem to have increasing amounts of 
interest in character analysis and other problematic situations. Several 
qualities, however, such as dramatic action, adventure, and pleasing char- 
acters are apparently keys to interest in any grade. How much of the 
emphasis upon certain qualities is due to the particular subject-matter in 
the selections cannot be determined from the data obtained. 
Uhl’s investigation, so far as it deals with grading, can be summarized 
as follows. Present-day practice varies widely in the placement of many 
selections, ‘The success of reading materials depends to a great extent upon 
the grade in which each selection is read. A moderate amount of flexi- 
bility in the placement of selections is desirable on account of varying aca- 
demic standards in different schools and because of the fact that many su- 
perior selections are successful in more than one grade. Choice of content 
should be made with reference to the interests of pupils, many of which 
appear to be fairly constant throughout the elementary grades. 
Desirable qualities of reading material—Jordan' employed the question- 
naire and library methods to discover children’s interests in reading. By 
the questionnaire method, he obtained first, second, and third choices of 
3598 pupils of Grades VI to XII as to books and magazines. The books 
named by the children “were classified into adult fiction, juvenile fiction, 
adventure, biography, history, poetry, science, travel, information, humor, 
miscellaneous.” The magazines named were classified as “adult fiction, 
juvenile fiction, adventure, nature, pictures, woman’s art, science, current 
events, ‘humor, miscellaneous.” 
It was found that books and magazines of adventure ranked highest ac- 
cording to boys’ choices, and that fiction ranked highest according to girls’ 
choices. Favorites with boys were The Call of the Wild, Treasure Island, 
and Boy Scout Series; with girls the favorites were Little Women, Polly- 
anna, and The Girl of the Limberlost. ‘The results indicated also that 
the interest in fiction of both boys and girls increases rapidly from the age 
of nine to the age of eighteen. The report of this study contains lists of 
books and magazines classified according to type and the relative fre- 
quency of each book and magazine. 
Jordan’s library investigation was made in eight libraries. Books and 
book lists were examined to find out the extent of their circulation. Later, 
he made over eight hundred observations to determine the approximate age

of children who read different books and to discover differences between the 
interests of boys and girls. He found great dissimilarity of interest between 
the sexes. ‘The major interests of boys from ten to thirteen years appeared 
to be in books about war and scouting, school and sports, Boy Scouts, and 
strenuous adventure. The most popular authors for these four types of 
fiction were Altsheler, Barbour, Burton, and Clements, respectively. The 
interests of girls were chiefly concerned with fiction which portrays home 
life and school life, fairy stories, stories with historical background, and love 
stories. The most popular writers of these works of fiction are: home and 
school, Alcott, Wiggin, Sidney, and Richards; fairy tales, Dodgson; love 
stories, Woolsey. An analysis of the books read indicated that boys were 
most interested in books which appeal “‘to the instinct of mastery, fighting, 
love of sensory life for its own sake, original attention and approval and 
scornful behavior.” In the same way it appeared that girls were most inter- 
ested in books which appeal “to the following instincts: maternal, kindli- 
ness, attention to others, response to approval and scornful behavior, and 
to a less degree than in the case of boys, to rivalry.” 
Miss Dunn’s' investigation was conducted to find out “what are the 
elements in primary reading material that are of interest to children in the 
first three grades of the elementary school.” She began her investigation by 
analyzing reading selections to discover the various appeals that the exist- 
ing materials make to readers. She then chose thirty-one representative 
selections from primary readers so that the following “elemental qualities” 
were included: child characters; adult characters; boy, the central figure; 
girl, the central figure; realistic, historical, and geographical material ; 
fairy stories, myths, folk stories, fables, and fanciful themes. 
The thirty-one samples were arranged in pairs in such order that certain 
qualities of likeness and difference existed between each pair of specimens. 
‘The samples were then read in pairs to pupils who were requested to indi- 
cate on “vote slips” their choices for each pair. 
After subjecting her data to statistical treatment, Miss Dunn concluded 
that characteristic appeals are “surprise and plot for both sexes, animalness 
for boys, and childness, familiar experience, and to a lesser extent repetition 
and conversation for girls.’ Miss Dunn concluded that instead of a 
child’s having a limited range of interests, his “tastes appear rather catholic.

or fiction, into prose or verse, into real or fanciful situations, and he is 
attracted and pleased.”

In pursuing the investigation of reading material referred to in an earlier 
section of this report, Uhl! canvassed teachers and pupils to discover inter- 
ests in and the effectiveness of reading selections. ‘The information thus 
obtained was classified and’ studied with a view to deriving standards for 
eliminating undesirable selections and detecting superior selections. 
Teachers’ responses indicated that aside from incorrect grading of con- 
tent, the most important undesirable characteristics of reading selections are 
abstractness, lack of action, unreality, too great length, gloominess, monot- 
ony, and poor literary style. ‘Teachers rated as “‘superior” selections which 
contain combinations of qualities as follows: selections which portray dra- 
matic action, adventure, heroism, interesting non-dramatic action, humor, 
fairy or supernatural activities, interesting characters, home life, child life, 
interesting problems, kindness, faithfulness, animal play, or other activities, 
personifications, and interesting repetition. ‘Uheir judgments indicated that 
selections have too often been included in readers for their alleged didactic 
qualities rather than for the qualities just mentioned, and that, as a result, 
many inferior or over-difficult selections have been published. The reports 
of this investigation contain lists of inferior and superior selections. and 
analyses of selections showing the reasons for the failure or success of certain 
selections. 
In addition to obtaining judgments about standard selections, Uhl col- 
lected data from teachers and pupils as to the effectiveness of certain in- 
formational selections contained in the Community Life Leaflets.2 These 
selections were found to be distinctly superior for use in grades VII and 
VIII. This investigation emphasizes the importance of consulting children 
in the selection and organization of courses in reading and literature. This 
view is supported by the judgments of three thousand teachers whose con- 
viction about the matter was expressed in no uncertain terms. 
In 1919 Gray and Bobbitt* made a survey of reading in Indianapolis. 
After the methods and materials had been examined and tabulated, desir- 
able standards of practice were set up, and the content of the course of study 
in reading was judged by these standards. 
Four stages in the acquisition of reading ability were described by Gray: 
“the initial period in attaching meanings to printed words (first grade) ; 
the development of the fundamental habits and associations involved in

fluent oral reading (second and third grades) ; the broadening of experi- 
ence through extensive silent reading (fourth, fifth, and sixth grades) ; the 
independent application of reading ability to all phases of school work 
(seventh and eighth grades.)” 
The fact was emphasized that the content for each stage of development 
must harmonize with its aim. During the initial period, therefore, the con- 
tent should be interesting and valuable to children and readily associated 
with vivid personal experiences. In Grades II and III the content must 
grip the attention and be simple enough to encourage rapid reading and 
to secure accuracy. In Grades IV, V, and VI “an abundance of interest- 
ing reading material is necessary both for the wide extension of reading ex- 
perience and for the development of ability to attach meanings to words. 
. .’ In addition to this easy, extensive reading, Gray advocated the 
use of material for training in deliberate reading such as is required in prob- 
lem-solving. 
From this point, Bobbitt continues to the “most pressing current question,” 
which he states as follows: ““What is the purpose of the reading experience 
of intermediate and grammar grades after the simple mechanics of reading 
has been mastered?” ‘The answer to this question shows the point. of view 
of the entire discussion: ‘“he purpose is to widen the vision and to extend 
the experience of the pupils beyond the confines of their narrow immediate 
environment.” 
The types of experience to be gained by reading are next analyzed. These 
types include geographical, historical, civic, scientific, imaginative, and 
such human experiences as are portrayed in general literature. For exam- 
ple, “the geographical readings should be such as to permit our children 
imaginatively to travel through the various cities and countries and regions 
of the earth. . . . Reading of this character should aim, not at infor- 
mation, but at experience. . . . The getting of information is a por- 
tion of the total experience.” Such reading is advocated especially in gen- 
eral literature. The bearing of this type of treatment ‘“‘on school procedure 
is easily evident. It demands a wide extension of supplementary and library 
reading opportunities. It demands much reading; it demands easy reading; 
it calls for interesting reading; it makes necessary a type of technique ot 
education quite different from the relatively ineffective fact-learning type.” 
Following these analyses is a list of the books used for required and sup 
plementary reading in Indianapolis. Having given a statement of what 
the schools should teach and a list of the books in use, the report continues 
with an analysis of these books in the light of the aims of the school. The 
analysis was made with reference to each of the types of content already 
mentioned. 
Of the concluding recommendations of the survey report, the following 
deal with the content of reading. 
That the content of the reading be chosen so as to give the pupils width of 
vision over, and depth of insight into, all important fields of human affairs.
-P-A-G-E-175
  
Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 175   
That the reading experience be adapted to the degree of maturity and previous 
experience of the pupils 
That those responsible for the reading content be fully conscious of the purposes 
to be served. 
That reading materials should be so graded . . . that the gradient is im- 
perceptible. 
That there be an abundance of reading experience covering in balanced way 
all important fields of human experience. 
That the quantity of reading material available be much greater than can be 
covered by any single pupil, however capable, in order to provide for all desirable 
types of tastes, desires, and appetites. 
Summary—Investigations have shown that while no single branch of con- 
tent has a monopoly upon the interests of children, certain types have main- 
tained a monopoly of space in readers. Statistical investigations show that 
there is such close agreement upon many favorite selections that certain 
textbooks contain little or no material which is not duplicated in certain 
other books. These studies show also that many of these duplications are 
in books intended for different grades. 
Experimental studies show that children have pronounced likes and dis- 
likes for certain reading selections and that the proper placement of selec- 
tions would greatly reduce dislikes. The information obtained from both 
teachers and pupils show the need for some degree of flexibility in grading; 
also that error is more likely to occur as a result of making the course in 
reading too difficult than of making it too easy. A sufficient array of 
teachers’ and pupils’ judgments exists to make possible the correct place- 
ment of standard selections. 
All investigations here reported support the conclusion that effective 
training in reading cannot be given when the content is over-difficult. The 
reasons which support this conclusion are that over-difficult content does 
not grip the reader’s attention, that such content retards the progress by 
limiting the amount which can be read, and that it forces the child to focus 
his attention upon the mechanics of reading to the detriment of compre- 
hension. Likewise, investigations indicate that the interests of children can 
be utilized to distinct advantage in both teaching and learning. ‘These 
investigations show clearly that while children often desert the realm of 
tine literature for that which provides merely crude passing pleasure, they 
can be interested also in worth-while literary selections, if they are properly 
placed as to difficulty. 
Analytical investigations have defined the needs of different periods of 
development and have shown the need for a miscellany of content to meet 
these needs. The content should be simple, highly charged with interest, and 
provided in abundance. It should also serve as a valuable substitute for 
real experience. 
VI. Scientific Studies in the Field of Literature 
Children’s interests in literature and the grading of reading selections— 
The first study of scientific validity to which reference will be made is

that of Jordan’s.t_ He not only used the questionnaire method more guard- 
edly than the previous investigators whom he reports in his first chapter, 
but he also made the following useful study of children’s reading in public 
libraries. He assigned points to books according to the number of. times 
they were drawn out, rebound, and waited for in line, and according to the 
amount of grime on the catalog cards recording them. It is interesting 
to note that the four most popular authors on the boys’ book list totaled con- 
siderably more than twice as many points as the first four books on the 
girls’ list. This was not because girls read less. Apparently, in spite of the 
usual separate analysis of qualities enjoyed, the girls read books on boys’ 
lists a good share of the time. Jordan has derived a useful list of the most 
popular writers at the time of his study and supplemented it with tables 
of correlation and with an analysis of the psychological factors which prob- 
ably account for interest in chosen books. 
Two unpublished studies made under Dr. Horn’s direction at the Uni- 
versity of lowa and summarized by the authors in the Elementary English 
Review have prepared the way for a scientific determination of the common 
essentials of a literature course. Mackintosh? first selected from good an- 
thologies one hundred poems for the fifth grade and arranged them in ten 
groups with like characteristics. “These were typed in uniform fashion and 
read aloud. Each child ranked each poem of the ten from one (‘“‘the best 
poem I ever heard”) to six (‘“‘the worst I ever heard”) ; each pupil also 
selected five that he liked best, and if he were willing to do so, marked those 
he would not recommend to another fifth grader, Reasons were also given 
and used in deriving final summaries of criteria for children’s choices. 
As a further experiment, fifty poems selected as best were tried in sev- 
eral fifth grades totaling 144 pupils without explaining why they were 
given, and ranks, per cent values, and P. E. values determined. The list 
derived is significant because it includes excellent new poems not commonly 
taught so far; it also omits many poems which have been conventionally ac- 
cepted, It is valid, of course, only for the titles on the original list of 100 
verses. “Che summary of reasons reenforces the view that children like 
humor, adventure and excitement, dialect, rhythm and rhyme, and under- 
standable experience. 
Garnett’s® study of children’s choices in prose followed the same gen- 
eral procedure. ‘The stories, like the poems, were read aloud to fourth- 
grade children, and 24 of the original list of 80 tried in six fourth-grade 
classes in Minneapolis including 103 boys and 144 girls. By “ a somewhat 
elaborate system of ranking and voting” these stories were grouped in

“preferred,” a “second preferred,” and a “least liked” list. The summary 
of reasons stresses children’s dislike of unworthy traits of character, of 
stories which they term “silly,” and of those they have heard too often. Five 
of the ten stories on the girls’ preferred list are also on the boys’. As far 
as the selections included are concerned the results of this study are very 
suggestive. It makes use of a method other than empiricism and adult 
opinion in reaching conclusions concerning children’s likes and dislikes in 
reading. 
Cavins’ study,! also unpublished, is reviewed briefly by Dr. Lyman in a 
recent article.2 His investigation deals with a problem which has not been 
sufficiently stressed in previous investigations, namely the comprehension of 
selections. This was tested by asking pupils to copy the lines which ex- 
pressed the author’s purpose or main idea or central thought. Cavins be- 
lieves that “unless 60 per cent of a grade can unaided discover this core 
of meaning and 40 per cent answer easy questions satisfactorily, the poem is 
more suitable for a higher grade.” ‘This surely is a sufficiently conservative 
position; yet the study demonstrated that “general practice places poems 
from one to three grades too low in the curriculum.” Such studies as this 
make possible more intelligent practice in the assignment of literary selec- 
tions, particularly poems, to the various school grades. 
The effects of teaching literature upon the commonly accepted objectives 
of the subject—Hosic’s doctoral study® relates to the effect of the teaching 
of literature in the grades by conventional methods upon the purposes 
usually accepted for this subject. Hosic examined four sets of reading 
books for grades four to six to discover the helps to study which they con- 
tain. “The emphasis was found to fall upon questions pertaining to the 
language used or the facts presented rather than upon conduct, technique, 
or expressional activities.” In contrast to this, “imaginative realization 
of the piece as a whole as a means to enjoyment and the enrichment of 
experience was found to be central” among authorities as to the nature and 
purpose of literature. ‘To weight these differing emphases Hosic tested the 
teaching of “four poems in two pairs of sixth-grade classes so as to alter- 
nate the methods used. For example, Holmes’ Chambered Nautilus was 
taught by means of an informal suggestive presentation of the whole to 
Class A and by means of detailed questions to Class B. Then Blake’s 
Tiger was presented by ‘means of detailed questions to Class A and as a whole 
to Class B. Browning’s How They Brought the Good News and Reed’s 
Sheridan’s Ride followed in the same way. Classes X and Y were handled 
similarly,” but with poems and methods reversed. In a preliminary test,

classes which merely read over or listened to the poems were found to prefer 
The Tiger and Sheridan’s Ride in a proportion of four to one. Neverthe- 
less, after both methods of teaching described above had been used, each 
class when tested as to its preferences was found to choose whichever poem 
had been taught to it as a whole. Thus when studied at too great length 
favorite poems ranked below the less favored ones which were more skil- 
fully and reasonably presented. Care was taken to find out that the poems 
which were not taught at full length were understood in their essential 
meaning. 
Hosic concludes: “There is apparently a disparity between the aims and 
methods of literature teaching per se and the aims and methods of classroom 
teachers and of editors of textbooks. The latter emphasize the linguistic 
element and familiarity with details of fact. . . . Method in teaching 
literature is a powerful factor, and may practically determine the attitude 
of a large majority of a class toward a literary selection. Probably the 
methods now used both by teachers and editors are largely unfitted to at- 
tain the objects set up by critical and educational authorities for the study 
of literature in school.” 
Measure of appreciation of poetry—The first successful attempt to. de- 
vise a scientific measure of literary appreciation was that of Abbott and 
Trabue.t The experiment consisted of taking verses of acknowledged and 
recognizable poetic merit and making three spoiled versions of each: one 
in which the emotional tone was violated by more or less obvious insincerity 
and exaggeration; one in which the imaginative quality was reduced to the 
prosaic; and one in which the rhythm was rendered either awkward or less 
fine than in the original. The four versions of each stanza were put on a 
single page and the reader required to mark one best and one worst. There 
were in each of the two tests thirteen such groups. Conclusions were all 
drawn from the choices of best versions. 
As the median judgments did not vary much from a chance distribution 
in grades V to VIII inclusive and in many cases were negative, the scale 
is of no value as a measuring device below the high school. In fact, the 
median judgments are not preponderantly in favor of the best versions until 
the fourth year of high school and the correlation of the two tests X and Y 
is only .44 for that grade. It is only as we come to the group of graduate 
students who are majoring in English and teachers of English that we 
get as high a median as 9.5 from the thirteen specimens and a correlation of 
.723 between the two tests. However, a distinct gain in appreciation is 
possible if the tests are taken and then discussed with high school children 
and with teachers of literature for that matter although this of course de- 
stroys their validity as a measuring device. 
Detailed analyses of the versions preferred in certain school years and 
of the apparent conclusions following upon these facts are significant and

are interestingly discussed by the authors. It is noted that disturbance of the 
rhythm is felt earliest; that the prosaic versions drop out of favor after 
the third year of high school or first year of college in the majority of pu- 
pils, but that the sentimentalized or emotionally false versions are preferred 
in nearly half of the poems well into the high school period, and in two in- 
stances by all save the graduate students. ‘There seems to be clear evidence 
that sentimentalism, if not positively promoted, is by no means rooted out 
by the procedures in school courses in literature. The authors are led to 
question whether there is in schools a tendency to inculcate a liking for ab- 
surdly false sentiment. 
VII. Reading Vocabularies 
This section describes the purpose of representative studies of reading vo- 
cabularies, outlines the methods employed in making each investigation, 
and presents the most important results. On account of the limitations 
of space, it has been impossible to include reference to all vocabulary studies 
or to present in detail the conclusions of the investigations to which refer- 
ence is made. 
Study of the Vocabularies of Beginning Books in Twelve Reading Methods* 
Purpose. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the vo- 
cabularies of the beginning books of twelve different sets of readers, each 
series representing a more or less distinct method of reading. 
Methods. 1. Each word was listed and its frequency determined for each 
book. Where the letter “‘s’” was used as a suffix, the word was counted 
with the root word. When other suffixes were added to the root, the words 
were listed separately. ‘It’s’ was not included with “‘its’” but was listed 
separately. Words connected with a hyphen were counted as two different 
words. 
2. A study was also made of the number of words common to any two 
books, to determine the extent to which the vocabularies were similar. 
Results. 1. A total of 1636 different words was found in the twelve 
beginning books. The number of words introduced in a single book ranges 
from 157 to 630. 
2. Four of the books have 70 per cent or more of the total number of 
words occurring less than 10 times; four others from 60 to 69 per cent; 
three from 50 to 59 per cent; and but one less than 50 per cent. 
3. Of 1636 different words found in all of the methods, 783 are found 
in only one book. Only 38 words are common to all twelve books. 
4, A large number of words appear only once in each book.

  The Vocabularies of Ten First Readers* 
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine the vocabularies 
of ten first readers in common use in American elementary schools. 
Method. The words of the readers were counted page by page and the 
frequency of each word listed. 
Results. The report of the study does not indicate the exact number of 
running words tabulated but an estimate shows it to be around 92,000. A 
total of 3541 words was found, only 96 of which appear in all ten first 
readers, and only 69 in nine of the ten readers. Two thousand forty- 
eight appear four times or less. 
The results are summarized in Tables 17 and 18. The first is a fre- 
quency table showing the exact number of words appearing with specified 
frequency.

A Mastery Vocabulary in Primary Reading’ 
Purpose. The purpose of this article was to describe the necessity for 
and methods of developing a basic vocabulary built upon a basal reading 
textbook series in use in a school system. ‘Teachers frequently feel that 
story readers are unsatisfactory for use due to the large vocabulary involved. 
‘To eliminate this difficulty a vocabulary analysis was made of the basic 
readers (Winston) in this school system (Springfield, IIl.). 
Method. The study involved the checking of each book of the series, 
listing the different words, scoring their frequency in each book, noting the 
words which held over from volume to volume, and the final selection of the 
words comprising the mastery vocabulary from those having the highest 
frequency in the greatest number of stories. The words in the second 
reader were scored only as different words, no frequency score being kept. 
Notes were taken of the words which were repeated from the primer and 
first reader. ‘The list was finally compared with the list submitted by E. T. 
Housh in the Seventeenth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study 
of Education, Part I, Chapter IV. Since this list is based upon the analy- 
sis of ten different second readers, presumably a list of words common to his 
list and an analysis of the Winston second reader would consist of words 
worth mastering. 
Results. 680 different words were selected for mastery in the first three 
grades, plus 100 more whose root forms were included in the 680 listed but 
whose endings were sufficiently different to demand attention. 
This list was then checked against the five groups of five hundred words 
each having greatest frequency of appearance in Thorndike’s “Teachers 
Word Book.” Four hundred eight of the 680 words selected were found 
in Thorndike’s first five hundred. Great similarity was also found between 
this list and the list in the Horn-Ashbaugh Speller. 
Analysis of the Vocabularies of Ten Second-Year Readers* 
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine scientifically the 
vocabulary of ten second readers in common use. 
Method. The words of each of the ten readers were first counted, page 
by page, and each word listed, together with the number of times it occurred

on the page. From this page list the vocabulary of each book was tabu- 
lated in a combination of an alphabetical and group system, together with 
the frequency of recurrence of each word in the entire book. From these 
vocabularies a tabulation was made showing the entire vocabulary of the 
ten books arranged in the same order as the separate vocabularies and con- 
taining the word-frequencies. 
Results. 1. The vocabulary common to all the readers studied is given 
together with the frequencies of each word that appeared fourteen times or 
more. Throughout the study, every difference in spelling is counted as a 
new word. 
2. A critical analysis of the vocabularies of a series of readers seems to 
give a measure of their value. 
3. Such an analysis will aid in selecting supplementary readers for 
use in connection with a given basic text. 
4. The readers in the second grade contain quite different lists of 
words. Of the thousands of words in the ten readers, only 419 are common 
to all ten, while when a “method” reader and a “content” reader are com- 
pared, the number of words common to the two books is still relatively 
small, ranging only from 655 to 928 words. 
5. Hundreds of the words used-in each reader occur only once, twice, 
or three times in that reader, thus failing to provide drill on these words. 
The Reading Vocabularies of Third-Grade Children* 
Purpose. An effort was made in this study to determine the number of 
words in the reading and spelling vocabularies of third-grade children, the 
rapidity of growth of these vocabularies from year to year, the frequency of 
the various words, and the correlation of vocabularies in different texts. 
Methed. Each word in each book was counted to determine the num- 
ber of times it was used in that book. Variations of words were listed as 
different words. Subject matter was not checked unless the child was re- 
quired to read it or to spell the words it contained.

Comment. A list of words of greatest frequency contains 35 of the 50 
words of greatest frequency listed in the Ayres Spelling Scale. The first 
13 words in this list of 50 words are the same as the first 13 words in the 
Ayres list of 1000 commonest words with the exception of the eleventh 
word. Said appears for that in the Ayres list. These 13 words constitute 
about 26 per cent of the running words in the third-year reading vocabu- 
lary. Approximately one-third of the words in this vocabulary occur but 
once. Undoubtedly this accounts for the persistence of many of these 
words as difficulties in the upper grades. 
Determination of the Technical Vocabulary of School Subjects* 
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine the words abso- 
lutely essential or important in school subjects. 
Method. 
A. Subjects selected for study: 
1. The mathematics group—arithmetic, algebra, geometry 
2. The language and literature group—English grammar, French grammar, 
Latin grammar, German grammar, English and American literature 
3. The history and civics group 
4. The science group—general science, geography, biology, chemistry, physics, 
physiology 
5. The manual arts group—home economics, manual training 
6. The art and music group 
B. Steps in the analysis of texts: 
1. Selected texts in wide use. Number varied with reading matter or diffuse- 
ness of vocabulary 
2. Each text read through by at least two readers who copied all words that 
they thought a child might have difficulty in understanding 
Many readers and many texts were used to compensate for any unreliability of 
the individual reader. 
New words listed at end. More and more readings were listed until three 
consecutive readings added less than one per cent new terms. 
Readings varied from eight in chemistry to twenty-three in history. Two hun- 
dred twenty-five were necessary to reach saturation point in all subjects. 
3. The procedure outlined in step 2 gave a list of words that varied from 291 
for algebra to 1691 for general science, These words were apparently not of 
equal importance and were therefore rated by teachers of the subjects as follows: 
(a) Checked twice words absolutely essential to the given subject; (b) Checked 
once those words important but not essential; (c) Left unchecked unimportant 
words. The number of teachers checking ranged from 27 in home economics to 
103 in arithmetic. The ratings in all subjects totaled 796. 
4. Marked lists were sorted according to subject and tabulated as follows: 
those words checked twice were given two marks; those checked once were 
given one mark; this gave the complete number of checks for each word in each 
list. (A word double checked by 50 teachers equalled 100 marks; a word double 
checked by 9 teachers equaled 32 marks.) Each word in the list received its total 
marks. In algebra 10,931 checks were tabulated; in arithmetic, 71,180; in general 
science, 68,731; etc.,

5. Words were divided into four classes. 
(1) Essential vocabulary; those words receiving one-half or more of the possible 
number of checks. 
(2) Accessory vocabulary; those words receiving from one fourth to one half 
of the possible number of checks, 
(3) Those words receiving less than one fourth of the total possible number 
of checks but which had been found in a third or more of the texts—that is, 
words appearing in the texts but not rated as important by the teachers. 
(4) Words not receiving one fourth of the total possible checks nor appearing 
in one third of the texts. These were eliminated. 
The first three classes were kept but differentiated in the printing. The common 
words in allied subjects were listed. The words common to all subjects in a 
group were separated. The words common to two or more subjects in a group 
but not to all were indicated by showing in which subjects they were important. 
The lists were printed using capitals for essential vocabulary, italics for acces- 
sory vocabulary, ordinary lettering for words appearing in texts but not con- 
sidered necessary by teachers. 
Results. The results are summarized in Table 19.

The number of common words in each group should be added to the 
words for each subject in that group to find the total number of words 
for each subject. For example, the arithmetic words equal 406 plus 143 
common words giving a total of 549. The same method is used for other 
subjects in any group.

A Method for Measuring the “Vocabulary Burden” of Textbooks* 
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for meas- 
uring the vocabulary difficulty or burden of public school textbooks. 
Method. A. Two questions involved in the elaboration of procedure: 
1. How many words in a reliable sampling of the vocabulary of a text and 
how to select this sampling? 2. How can difficulty be measured best? 
B. Steps—1. A 1000 word unit was chosen as sufficient. 2. Estimated 
the number of pages at one line each to get a total of 1000 words. (500 
pages in a book at 10 words per line using every fifth page.) 3. Every third 
line used, except in the newspaper, where one page was studied. 4. The 
different words in each 1000 running word sample were listed alphabetically. 
5. Each different word was given the index number from Thorndike’s 
Word Book. The theory was that the higher the median index number 
the easier the vocabulary. 6. A second sampling taken from third line on 
similar series of pages. 7. Sixteen types of reading matter studied. 
C. Definitions—1. Vocabulary range-number of different words in 1000; 
2. Zero value words—those words not found in the 10,000 of Thorndike’s 
Word Book; 3. weighted median index number—median index number 
with zero-value words counted twice. 
Conclusions. 
A. Limitations pointed out by author 
1. Question as to reliability of such a sampling. 
2. A summary like the above leaves out important elements. Any 
average covers up points that a complete distribution would show. 
3. Any faults and errors in the Thorndike Word List are involved. 
B. Potentialities. 
1. Reliability may be increased by using more 1000 word counts. 
2. Method useful in finding the vocabulary distribution throughout a 
text, for example, the first chapter versus the last.

important, as in general science and chemistry.

Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine ‘‘the frequency of 
occurrence of words in the talk our pupil and graduate will or should hear, 
and the books, articles, letters, and the like, which he will or should hear.” 
Method. The words in a part or all of each of forty-one sources in- 
cluding materials read by children and by adults were counted. A plural 
formed by adding s was not counted separately, but entered under the sin- 
gular form. ‘“The same procedure was followed, except in certain cases for 
special reasons, with plurals where y is replaced by ies, adverbs formed from 
adjectives by adding /y, comparatives formed by adding er or r, superlatives 
formed by adding est or st, verb forms derived by adding s, ed or d, n, and 
ing, in cases where the derived form would probably be easily read and 
understood by the pupil when he experienced it, if he knew the primary 
word. Adjectives formed from proper nouns by adding n are also, as a 
rule, counted with the noun.” The frequency of each word was determined 
first for each source separately. These frequencies were then added and the 
result thus obtained was called the “sum of credits” or “credit sums.”

Results. The study resulted in the most comprehensive usable word 
list which is available. Ten thousand of these words, together with their 
“credit sums” are published in the Teachers Word Book, published by 
Teachers College, Columbia University. 
The following uses of the word list are suggested by Thorndike: Aids 
in determining words which merit emphasis in teaching; aids in establishing 
and clarifying standards for grades and by ages; aids in evaluating text- 
books or in determining the suitability of their vocabularies; helps in the 
grading and selection of readers; aids in determining phonic elements which 
occur most frequently; suggests a basis or standard vocabulary for use 
in teaching English to foréigners; suggests additions to existing spelling 
scales; and aids in improving reading tests. 
VIII. The Evaluation of Teaching Techniques 
The problem. Current practice in reading has been the topic of much 
criticism. Many widely prevalent techniques are so manifestly out of line 
with sound aims that it would seem to be superfuous to submit them to 
experimental evaluation. Critical writers? have long been convinced of the 
need for a thoroughgoing reconstruction of reading techniques. Judd main- 
tains that the time for minor revisions is over and points the need for em- 
bodying fundamental revisions in an experimenta! program for evaluation. 
Meanwhile, although numerous independent studies have provided a sci- 
entific basis for fundamental changes, these have only recently been incor- 
porated in an inclusive program of reading instruction. Certain special 
techniques have been evaluated with reference to immediate and restricted 
outcomes, Such studies are less significant to curriculum workers than ex- 
periments which eventuate with conclusions of more general import. The 
increased relative significance of silent reading in grades above the third 
is quite generally acknowledged, but the traditional techniques of instruc-

tion in oral reading are so comfortably familiar to teachers that they often 
persist in the face of cumulative evidence! of thé significance of silent read- 
ing. This conservatism is perhaps largely due to the fact that recommenda- 
tions were not accompanied by specific suggestions as to desirable techniques 
or preferred procedures. 
Contributions of specific studies. The formulation of practical pro- 
cedures and the evaluation of techniques are, however, a stupendous co- 
operative task which has been visioned more clearly than it has been re- 
alized.? Some factors which determine the comparative desirability of vari- 
ous techniques are psychological. The early investigations of Cattell, Boggs, 
Huey,® show that (a) Meaning should be stressed from the very begin- 
ning; (b) Words are more readily recognized if presented in context; (c) 
For beginners especially the procedure should avoid direct emphasis on 
recognition of words and sounds. 
Buswell* compared contrasting methods of beginning reading by a thor- 
ough-going analysis of pupil performance and concluded that methods should 
not be judged by their outcomes at the end of the first grade. Immediate 
results in skill may have been obtained at the expense of habits which influ- 
ence later development. Thus it is necessary to evaluate techniques with 
reference to the nature and range of their ultimate effects on reading devel- 
opment. ‘This study also shows the specific effects of techniques. For exam- 
ple, training in word recognition cannot be assumed to transfer to, or be 
automatically transformed into, general reading ability. Abilities are gen- 
eral only when the specific elements of training and experience have been 
varied and inclusive.

The specific nature of reading habits is also strikingly shown by C. T. 
Gray,' and by Judd and Buswell.? In the intermediate grades special sets 
of habits must be developed to enable pupils to cope with study materials 
effectively. Teachers should study the effects of instruction and select 
techniques and organize procedures with reference to their probable out- 
comes. The purposeful selection of techniques in terms of varied objectives 
is conducive to flexibility of reactions and the adjustment of reading habits 
to varying purposes, needs, or content. 
Gates® shows that special reading and study technique can be developed 
and that the transfer from one type of training to another, while positive, 
is too small to be depended upon. ‘Training must, therefore, be many- 
sided. Practice exercises should be so framed that the pupils are conscious 
of the purpose for which they are reading, and so that all pupils are held 
responsible for the results. Certain test techniques may suggest economical 
procedures for such training. 
Horn‘ suggests that speed and comprehension are not the ultimate ob- 
jectives in teaching reading but that objectives must be stated in terms 
of needs, situations, and activities in life. He also maintains that techniques 
must be evaluated broadly and with reference to these objectives, rather 
than by reference to their effect on standard test scores. That does not 
imply that comprehension and rate are insignificant but rather that they 
are too general for the organization and evaluation of specific procedures. 
This criticism is particularly significant with reference to the develop- 
ment of abilities which are not taken into account by standardized tests. 
Dr. Hosic’s® study is an example of a direct evaluation of procedure and 
non-skill outcomes. ‘Theisen® evaluates the effect of extensive reading by 
correlating amount read with growth in ability. In the same book informal

tests are used to measure the effectiveness of certain techniques.t The 
latter is an attempt to measure the spread of effects in an activity which 
combines reading with other activities. Hoover? evaluated certain indi- 
vidual phrase card drills with action responses by using the Monroe Stan- 
dardized Silent Reading Test before and after a three-month training 
period and found that the drill sections made more pronounced improvement 
in both comprehension and rate. 
Another type of evaluation is represented by classroom studies in which 
the organization of the work takes account of individual differences. The 
progress of the pupils along the lines of various individual needs is re- 
ported. By such studies® the relative effectiveness of certain types of ad- 
justment to individual needs and interests is shown. Such adjustments are 
highly effective when curriculum and materials recognize such needs. These 
studies also show how the early detection of difficulty is facilitated by the 
regular use of informal diagnostic tests and checks on extensive reading. 
Summary. The aspects of techniques which have adequate experimental 
sanction are: 
. The presentation of words in context in work with beginners. 
. Emphasis on meaning from the very beginning. 
. Emphasis on silent reading in grades above the third. 
. The use of informal tests as a regular part of silent reading technique. 
5. Provision for systematic development of specific reading and study habits 
through purposeful specific practice. 
6. The use of varied techniques adjusted to varied materials and purposes. 
7. Continued diagnostic teaching and study of pupil reactions for the purpose 
of effective guidance.

ing to determine their ability to interpret, their spontaneity of attack, and 
their accomplishment in other phases of reading; (2) the discovery of the 
individual needs of pupils with regard to phonetic training; and (3) the 
evaluation of phonetic elements to discover the most essential elements for 
use in training. 
These investigations* show that ability to recognize words quickly and 
independently is essential to continued progress in reading. The question 
remains as to the degree to which this fundamental habit should be de- 
veloped in relation to other fundamental reading habits at different grade 
levels. Studies of eye movements by Judd? show clearly that confusion 
arises when no satisfactory method of word attack has been developed. He 
recommends phonetic analysis as a valuable method of attacking new words 
and of eliminating periods of confusion. 
‘The tendency of many teachers is to question the wisdom of training in 
word calling at the expense of right attitudes toward reading and of ability 
to comprehend. Investigators recognize this difficulty but maintain that 
training in phonetics is legitimate at a given grade level, provided all essen- 
tial phases of reading are given adequate emphasis. 
Waste of time and effort are indicated in the case of pupils who have a 
keen phonic sense when they are held to routine phonic drills. A large 
number of pupils need basic phonic training. Foreign children without 
satisfactory language habits, children with speech defects, and certain 
remedial cases in reading seem to need more intensive training carefully 
adapted to their specific difficulties. Investigations show clearly that the 
amount and kind of phonic training must be adapted to individual needs. 
Evaluation of phonetic elements is dependent in part upon agreement as 
to what constitute such elements. No such agreement exists in the 
studies? which have been published. Each investigator has defined and 
classified the phonic elements somewhat differently. ‘The frequency of each

element in the reading vocabulary examined in each investigation has been 
adopted as the measure of its importance. ‘The application of this method 
to a local situation appears in the Winnetka study,’ and its relation to 
tendencies shown in twenty basic series of readers appears in Ducker’s 
study.” 
Needed scientific investigations in the field of phonetics have been sum- 
marized by Gray as follows: “A comprehensive study of the frequency of 
occurrence of all important phonetic elements and of the various combina- 
tions in which they occur, based on a word list which shows the frequency 
of words in common use in primary reading materials; the difficulties pre- 
sented in teaching various elements ; the relative merits of different elements 
and combinations in unlocking words; the time at which different elements 
and combinations of elements should be introduced; the amount of train- 
ing which different types of pupils need; conditions under which training 
can be introduced to best advantage; the methods most effective in group 
instruction and with different types of individuals.” 
X. Provision for Individual Differences 
One of the most important educational discoveries of recent years has 
been the fact that a wide range of abilities is represented in every grade 
and subject. The existence of individual differences is widely recognized. 
We know relatively little, however, of the nature, extent, and causes of 
these differences. The practical problem is to determine as nearly as possi- 
ble what these differences are and how to deal with them economically. 
Evidence points to the need of a considerable amount of differentiated 
instruction whereas mass instruction, except in rare instances, has been the 
rule. 
The nature of individual differences in reading—The first step is to 
determine the nature and extent of the differences. Such differences as are 
included by the general terms, “rate” and “comprehension,” are relatively 
easy to measure, if one will only take the necessary pains to give several 
standard reading tests. Differences in many of the more subtle reading 
traits are less readily determined. It is even more difficult to determine 
the extent of such differences. It is likely that the pupils of a grade differ 
widely in each of the various ways in which a child is called upon to use 
reading. Children of a given class when reading the same material for 
the first time exhibit marked differences in such respects as these:

A pupil may exhibit almost any degree of development in any of the 
various abilities. ‘These abilities probably exist in various sorts of com- 
binations in different individuals. Some are closely related, but others are 
not. A child may possess superior ability in some, ordinary skill in certain 
ones, and inferior ability in others. Unfortunately, we know very little 
as to the possible limits of most of these abilities. Probably no two chil- 
dren in any class are alike, or even approximately so. Probably they are 
no more alike than two men of the same height, but of different races, 
might be said to be alike. The importance of making these distinctions

with care in connection with certain of the abilities listed has been indicated 
by Gates and by Courtis.1 Remedial instruction will doubtless differ for 
various types of ability. 
The causes of differences—Differences in reading ability are the result 
of many causes, some of which are suggested by the foregoing statements 
concerning the nature of differences. Among the more obvious causes of 
differences may be listed (1) the level of intelligence represented, (2) the 
methods of teaching employed, (3) interest and mental effort aroused, (4) 
habitual reading attitudes formed, (5) amount and character of reading 
done, (6) background of experience and language development, and (7) 
the extent to which teachers understand the nature of individual differences 
and the kind of treatment needed. To this list may be added defects of 
hearing, speech, and vision. The limitations of space make it impossible 
to discuss more than a few of these. 
Levels of intelligence represented—Studies of the relative attainments of 
classes sectioned according to ability show decided differences in the progress 
of the different groups in reading.?. The actual correlations, however, 
between reading and intelligence when the latter has been measured by the 
Stanford-Binet test which requires less reading than the group intelligence 
tests was not particularly high. When group intelligence tests were used 
Gates found that the correlation increased from the lower to the higher 
grades suggesting that possibly intelligence’ in reading manifests itself most 
largely after the mechanics of reading have been fairly well mastered. 
Poor readers, however, have been discovered even among children with 
intelligence quotients of 120 or over. Judd points out that there are 
undoubtedly pupils of excellent native ability who are perverted by bad 
methods of instruction, a matter which Gates’ findings tend to confirm. It 
is possible, therefore, that we have attached too much significance to the 
level of intelligence attained and not enough to other causes of individual 
differences. 
Methods of teaching employed—Haphazard and unsystematized methods 
of attacking the printed page form an important cause of individual differ-

ences.t The reading accomplishments of most pupils are the outgrowth of 
_various combinations of good, bad, and indifferent methods. For example, 
Gates reports that some backward readers whom he has studied have had 
no training whatever in the perception of words and that others have 
received inappropriate training. In at least one third of these backward 
readers lack of training or inappropriate training is responsible for a part 
of the difficulty in reading. Some pupils fortunately develop good reading 
habits in spite of the lack of specific training. Until quite recently little 
of the so-called “teaching of reading,” aside from mechanical phrases, has 
been worthy of that term. Fortunately many teachers are being trained 
to teach silent reading. The: fact that there is frequently a low correlation 
between accomplishment records in different types of silent reading probably 
indicates lack of training in certain types.® 
Interest and mental effort aroused—Pupils otherwise equal will develop 
differences in reading ability on account of differences in interest and mental 
effort put forth. Zirbes reports that variations in the amount of training 
and practice needed to correct similar faults in different pupils not only 
showed differences in native ability but also in mental inertia. “Some pupils 
never knew their powers because they had not been aroused, but were 
allowed to putter away at a very low level of attention.” The effect of 
an indifferent attitude is emphasized repeatedly by Gray.* Judd finds that 
some pupils develop a mental lethargy, as the result of poor methods, which 
simulates very closely native sluggishness of temperament. Zirbes calls 
attention to the fact that asking pupils to follow the pace of a poor reader 
when interest is urging them on causes indolence and works against the 
formation of good reading habits.° 
Habitual reading attitude formed—Many pupils appear to develop a cer- 
tain fixed type of attack in all reading activities, regardless of the purpose 
for which reading is intended on given occasions. Some read rapidly and 
neglect details. Others form the habit of reading every detail with pains- 
taking care. Uhl® found some pupils who made low scores on account of 
extreme care and others on account of extreme carelessness. Zirbes points

out that a preponderance of any one type of reading practice tends to lower 
the efficiency in neglected types—that is, if careful reading is pursued to 
the exclusion of rapid silent reading, the reader will lose in ability to scan 
rapidly material of little value for the purpose of selecting passages which 
deserve careful reading. Judd and Buswell concluded that reading les- 
sons which require pupils to search every nook and corner of the line for 
rhetorical intricacies tend to destroy the habit of reading in a straight- 
forward fashion.” 
Amount and character of material read—lIt is a matter of common belief 
and there is some statistical evidence to show that the amount and charac- 
ter of the material read are significant factors in producing individual dif- 
ferences in reading accomplishment. Zirbes’ data show a correlation of 
0.53 (Spearman) between home reading and rate. Facts secured by Gray, 
Theisen, and Woody indicate some correlation between reading ability and 
the amount read. Owing to the fact, however, that some read carelessly 
it is difficult to determine the real effect of quantitative reading. Further- 
more, many pupils probably fail to develop good reading habits because 
much of the material read is too difficult, poorly written, of little content 
value, or insufficient in quantity. 
Experience—Experience is an additional factor of unknown magnitude 
in producing differences in children. Lack of experience is a handicap and 
wide experience a boon to good reading. Gray found that the failure of 
readers poor in the mechanics of reading to establish fundamental habits 
of interpretation was due to limited experience. Kindergarten and pre- 
school experience has considerable bearing upon early development in read- 
ing. The child with a large fund of experience has a larger supply of 
associations to aid him in comprehending the meaning and significance of 
what he reads. New ideas are linked up with familiar experiences of the 
past. Everyone is familiar with the handicaps under which children com- 
ing from homes of limited advantages suffer. 
The treatment of individual differences—The primary aim should be to 
develop the reading ability of every child to its maximum. The object 
is not to level all differences as some have erroneously believed. Classroom 
teaching should be so planned that each individual will receive the training 
he needs without receiving attention which rightfully belongs to other chil- 
dren.

Diagnosis—The first step in treatment is an adequate diagnosis of the 
child’s reading ability and of his intelligence. Since few specialized tests 
are available, teachers will need to depend upon analyses of the responses 
of pupils to exercises in standard tests which call forth different types of 
ability and upon informal tests of their-‘own making." 
Grouping by ability—lIn schools of sufficient size pupils may be grouped 
with profit according to intelligence.? This, however, will solve only a 
part of the difficulty. Within classes, the teacher will find it advisable 
to group those needing instruction of particular types for as many lessons 
as may be necessary.* During such periods the remaining pupils of the 
group may be assigned reading from selected library books or given indi- 
vidual reading problems.

Gradation of materials—Gradation of materials to suit the ability of the 
children is a rather common practice.! Zirbes arranged a collection of 
library reading material suitable for different ability groups. According 
to the plan adopted in the upper grades by Superintendent Kircher when at 
Merrill, Wisconsin, books were arranged in three lots according to diffi- 
culty. A somewhat similar plan is in use at Winnetka, Illinois, where 
every child, regardless of his grade in school, is assigned a list of material 
appropriate for the grade to which his reading test record corresponds. 
When he completes the assigned list he is retested and given a new list 
appropriate for the grade which his accomplishment then approximates. 
Such plans call for less uniformity and more variety in purchasing books. 
Independent reading—Provision of opportunities for independent read- 
ing has much to commend it. The classroom bookshelf for reading when- 
ever time permits, supervised home reading, and individual or group prob- 
lems and projects allow the child to read unhampered at his own pace and 
according to his own interests. Some teachers use a number of the regular 
reading periods each week for independent silent reading from library 
books and magazines. Stronger pupils may be asked to review books for 
others, or may be given more advanced problems. While such groups are 
reading independently the teacher may devote his attention to the weaker 
ones.? 
Special help—Special help is always necessary for some individuals and 
for small groups. Special drills for overcoming particular types of weak- 
ness should be given to those needing it. Such drills may be appropriate 
for any of the specific reading abilities listed in the section describing in- 
dividual differences. At times, it is necessary to aim at improvement in 
some phase other than the one in which real improvement is desired. The 
case studied by Gray emphasizes the fact that “A pupil may read slowly 
because of poor or inaccurate habits in other phases of reading. In such 
cases the pupil’s rate of reading cannot be improved until these related 
habits have been corrected. Therefore, remedial instruction to improve the 
rate of silent reading may include exercises in the mechanics of oral read- 
ing and in the interpretation of what is read.”* Weaknesses common to 
most members of the class are more profitably treated as class exercises, 
excusing only such pupils as are clearly not in need of a particular 
type of training. Rarely should class time be used for drill on exercises

needed only by a very few. Suggestions for dealing with many specific 
types of individual difficulties are to be found in the reports of individual 
case studies.* 
Exercises to stimulate independent thinking—One of the most readily 
administered provisions for individual differences is the liberal use of 
assignments and class exercises which stimulate independent thinking and 
research. Questions of the problem type which offer possibilities for inde- 
pendent investigation and study are especially suitable for this purpose. 
Such exercises permit the brighter pupils to utilize their ability to weigh 
values, to read between the lines, to see relationships and contrasts, to skim 
and to select the larger units of organization.? Pupils who need training 
in specific types of interpretation may be assigned problems which require 
them to exercise the particular type of interpretative ability that is lacking.® 
Thus, pupils weak in ability to organize may be given problems requiring 
organization. 
Development of individual interests—Individual needs may be cared for 
to some degree by properly developing and capitalizing each child’s particu- 
lar interest. Gray points out in connection with his recommendations for 
remedial treatment of poor readers that “keen interest must be aroused 
in reading through the use of material directly related to the pupil’s inter- 
ests.” The teacher’s most difficult problem is to find where each pupil’s 
interests lie and how to utilize them. Principal Rohan’s development of

reading interests around club activities is suggestive of a method of ap- 
proach.t When once the pupil’s interest has been aroused in the necessary 
reading material, he frequently develops rapidly without much assistance 
from the teacher. 
XI. Diagnosis and Remedial Work 
‘The major implication of diagnostic and remedial work for curriculum 
workers lies in the study of the causes of difficulty. These show how chil- 
dren are diverted from normal lines of reading development and how cer- 
tain specific types of work correct wrong tendencies. “The presence of a 
large number of remedial cases in a school or school system is indicative of 
a lack or a wrong emphasis in the curriculum. Reduction of the number 
of deficient readers and the growth in the reading abilities of deficient read- 
ers are most noticeable when causes of deficiency are investigated and 
brought under control. Deficiencies of long standing are harder to remedy 
than incipient defects. Thus prompt provision for individual needs is 
essential. 
Diagnostic analysis and remedial practice have not yet been validated by 
application to a sufficient number of cases. To facilitate such analysis and 
application and to assist the teacher in work with problem cases a chart? 
has been prepared from an analysis of outstanding studies.* ‘The chart,

which is too detailed to include in this report contains lists of deficiencies, 
probable causes, and appropriate remedial measures, is accompanied by the 
recommendations that: 
1. Remedial work be preceded by a thoroughgoing inquiry into the nature and 
causes of the deficiency. 
2. Remedial work be planned with specific reference to individual needs and 
causes of deficiency. 
3. Records of growth be kept.

ing pupil reactions and making prompt adjustments to individual needs before 
chronic deficiency and discouragement result,

gated with the purpose of discovering a general cause requiring curricular ad- 
justment. 
XII. Time Allotment for Reading 
Time allotment—The amount of time which should be given to reading 
has been and still is an important issue. One of the most important of 
the earlier studies was made by Holmes! who obtained information from 
fifty American cities. His data showed that an average of 53 minutes was 
given to reading each day in the first grade and that the total amount of 
time decreased gradually from the first to the eighth grade inclusive. ‘The 
important facts revealed in some of the more recent studies will be sum- 
marized briefly. 
In Indianapolis and other cities—In the reading survey of Indianapolis, 
Gray? presented the average time allotment for fifty cities as determined by 
Holmes, the time allotment for Cleveland in 1915, and the time allotment 
for Indianapolis in 1917. ‘The numbers of hours given to reading in 
these cities are shown in Table 20. The entries in the table show that In-

dianapolis gave a relatively small amount of time to reading. The results 
of the standardized tests which were given showed that the pupils ranked 
low in reading accomplishment. We may reasonably conclude in view of 
these facts that Indianapolis was not giving sufficient time to reading to 
obtain satisfactory results. A second explanation is that the time was not 
used most effectively. It is possible that both factors were operative in 
this case. 
In forty-nine large cities—Ayer' reported in 1924 the results of a com- 
parative study of the time allotment for reading in Seattle and 49 large 
cities. A tabular summary of his data appears in Table 21 in terms of the 
number of minutes given to reading per week. These findings show clearly 
that large cities are now giving more time to reading in most grades than 
was shown in earlier studies, such as Holmes’. Ayer’s study revealed also 
that many large cities are at present modifying their courses of study and 
time allotments. ‘There is also a tendency in many cities “to give less 
attention to arbitrary daily time allotments in the primary grades, where the 
work goes by projects rather than by subjects.”

In thirty-one first-class schools of North Dakota—Kirk* made a study 
of the actual program followed in thirty-one school systems and determined 
the number of minutes per week spent in recitation. A summary of his 
findings appear in Table 22. The entries in the table show that the 
schools of North Dakota are not giving on the average as much time to 
reading as is done in forty-nine cities. They are giving more time, however, 
than large cities devoted to reading several years ago when Holmes made 
his investigation.

In rural schools—Reinoehl* made an analysis of the daily time schedules 
recommended in twenty-six model programs for one year rural schools as 
published in state courses of study. Information was recorded concerning 
the number of daily recitation periods and the total number of minutes per 
week given to reading in each grade. His findings appear in Table 22 and 
reveal a surprisingly small amount of time given to reading in comparison

with the time allotment in large cities. This fact doubtless explains in 
part the relatively poor reading accomplishment of rural pupils described 
in recent surveys. 
Distribution of time between oral and silent reading—Two studies of 
time distribution between oral and silent reading will be referred to in 
this report. The first was made in 1917 by Gray? who obtained informa- 
tion from teachers concerning the percentages of time set aside for read- 
ing that were given to oral and to silent reading. His findings appear in 
Table 23. The entires in the table show the number of teachers reporting 
given percentages of time devoted to (0) oral reading and to (s) silent 
reading.

The entries in Table 23 reveal wide variations in practice in each grade.

The greatest diversity of practice is revealed in the grades above the fourth. 
In interpreting Table 23 two facts should be kept in mind: (a) The data 
were secured in 1917 before schoolroom practice had been greatly influ- 
enced by the recent emphasis on silent reading; and (b) The records are 
based on teachers’ statements of their practice and not on records of the 
actual distribution of time. 
A recent study is reported by McGaughey’ of the practice in 305 cities. 
His findings show that both oral and silent reading are taught in most 
grades from the first to the eighth inclusive. “This practice is somewhat 
more universal in the case of oral than of silent reading. 
Concluding statement—Although definite conclusions concerning time al- 
lotment for reading cannot be drawn from the studies to which reference 
has been made, nevertheless, the results of these investigations are suggestive. 
Quoting from Kirk: “In the absence of all absolute knowledge the practice 
of the majority would seem to be a more satisfactory standard than no 
standard at all. A standard that is derived from statistics is better than 
one that is not derived at all. . . . There ought to be, within certain 
limits, a time allotment for each subject that would give the most satis- 
factory results, and it should be at the point where the law of diminishing 
returns operates most severely.” 
It is hoped that within the near future standards may be derived which 
will be applicable to various types of schools and to classrooms which follow 
different procedures in teaching pupils to read.

  CHAPTER VI 
HANDWRITING 
Frank N. Freeman, School of Education, University of Chicago, 
Chicago, Illinois, Chairman 
may be prefaced by a brief survey of the kinds of facts which are 
pertinent to the determination of curriculum standards in hand- 
writing. This will furnish a background upon which to project the studies 
in question and thus determine how far they have covered the field. 
‘There are at least three classes of facts which have important bearing 
upon the problem. ‘They are as follows: 
1. The degree of skill which children are able to attain at a certain point 
in their schooling with a reasonable amount of training. 
‘The curriculum standards are sometimes expressed wholly in terms of 
an external demand. ‘This taken alone is never sufficient. A decision must 
be based upon considerations which are analogous to those determining one’s 
actions in case of a proposed purchase. Action is determined by both value 
and purchase price or cost. If it is of little value, even a low cost will not 
justify its purchase. If it is of great value, it will justify a correspondingly 
high price. The attainments which children make under various amounts 
and kinds of training, therefore, must constitute one of the legs which sup- 
port the curriculum structure. 
2. A second pertinent fact is the quality of writing which prevails among 
persons who employ handwriting for various purposes. 
The argument supporting the validity of this type of evidence is that if 
large groups of persons actually get by with a certain quality or speed of 
writing, that this writing is sufficient for their purposes. ‘This argument 
has some weight, though it is of course possible that all the persons in ques- 
tion are writing at a lower quality than would be profitable to them. The 
argument is perhaps somewhat stronger when it is applied to the relative 
attainments of different groups of persons. If we find that one vocational 
group, for example, writes better than another group, this fact is some 
indication that one vocation makes a higher demand than does the other. 
3. The third pertinent factor is a demand expressed more directly in 
terms of specific requirements set up by certain vocations, or in terms of the 
opinion of persons responsible for the employment of individuals. 
‘The committee has not been able to discover specific demands in which 
minimum essentials in handwriting for entrance to particular occupations 
are set up. It has been able, however, to gather together a considerable 
body of opinion of employing officials concerning the necessity of different 
grades of handwriting for employees. 
The individual studies will first be reported separately and will then be 
summarized in the concluding section.

Studies Which Are Chiefly Quantitative 
STUDY NO. 1. Freeman, Frank N. “Handwriting.” Fourteenth 
Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education. Chicago, 
Univ. of, Chicago Press. pp. 61-67. 
Problem. The problem of this report was two-fold. In the first place 
it undertook to estimate the capacity of children to develop various degrees 
of skill in handwriting under the conditions of public school instruction. 
In the second place, the problem was to secure evidence concerning the 
demand which is made upon the employees of various types of business in 
respect to handwriting. 
Method. The method which was used in determining the ability of chil- 
dren to learn to write was an analysis of the results of widespread surveys 
by means of tests of handwriting. A comparison was made of the attain- 
ments of children in a large number of schools and the relationship between 
the time spent in handwriting and the attainments of pupils was studied. 
In attacking the second problem a questionnaire was sent to fourteen busi- 
ness firms relative to the kind of work demanded of their employees, the 
importance of writing, and the quality and speed of writing which they con- 
sidered necessary. 
Summary of Findings. The first findings of the report consist of the 
scores of about thirty-four thousand children in fifty-six cities in speed and 
quality of handwriting. In addition to the median in speed and quality 
for grades two to eight, the median of the schools which represents the upper 
half and lower half of the entire group, respectively, is given. These median 
scores are shown in Table 24.

It should be noted that in order to be in the upper half a school must 
be superior in a combination of rate and quality and'not in rate or quality 
alone. 
The question was now raised whether the median of the upper half of 
the schools might legitimately be taken as a standard of achievement. ‘This 
would depend upon the causes of superiority. Among the possible causes 
considered were superior native ability of children, superior ability or train- 
ing of teachers, a superior method of supervision or of instruction, and a
-P-A-G-E-207
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 207   
greater amount of time spent in drill. The first of these explanations was 
ruled out as being improbable. The last was investigated by comparing 
the amount of time spent by the twenty-three cities of the upper half and 
the twenty-three cities of the lower half. The average number of minutes 
per week spent by the cities in the upper half was 73.4, and by those in the 
lower half 73.3. The explanation, therefore, must lie in the ability and 
training of teachers, or in the methods of instruction. It seemed to the 
author legitimate to adopt as a standard one which could be obtained by 
superior methods of instruction, not in the exceptional school but in a large 
number of schools scattered all over the country. 
A special situation was found with reference to speed. While the quality 
advanced uniformly throughout the grades, speed showed a slower advance 
in the grades above the fifth. By comparing the speed curve with Gilbert’s 
curve in rate of tapping, it was found that the break came at a correspond- 
ing point. The diminished gain, therefore, rests upon a natural founda- 
tion in the child’s slackened development. It was found that certain schools, 
seven in particular, were able to overcome this tendency to a slower de- 
velopment and to maintain a uniform growth in speed. It was held to be 
desirable to maintain this uniform growth even at the expense of slightly 
greater emphasis upon speed in the upper grades. 
From these considerations tentative norms or standards were proposed 
as shown in Table 25.

The results of the questionnaires to business firms are shown in Table 26. 
Out of twenty-nine cases in which a quality is mentioned, fifteen are of 
quality 60, and seven of quality, 70. The others scattered from 30 to 90. 
It is to be presumed that these are occupations in which handwriting is most 
important. The prevailing opinion, then, appears to be that 60 is sufficiently 
good with half as many considering 70 as necessary. 
Supplementary data upon the attainment of pupils. In order to 
determine whether the average attainments which are given in Table 26 
are representative of school children in general, a number of other investi- 
gations have been consulted and their results brought together in Table 27. 
Table 27 indicates that there is considerable variation in the achievement 
found in the various investigations. In quality, for example, the average 
attainment at the sixth grade varies from 47 to 58.2.

  In speed the average varies from 62.8 to 73. A similar variation may be 
found in the scores of the eighth grade. It is apparent that the average 
scores obtained in some cities is considerably higher than that obtained in 
others. Surveys have repeatedly shown also that the attainment of pupils 
in different schools varies widely. ‘The attainments of the children in 
Grand Rapids and St. Louis and the attainments of the upper half of the 
schools in Freeman’s survey agree rather closely. The average attainment 
found in the other investigations in speed does not depart from these aver- 
ages. In quality, however, they fall considerably lower.

of quality in handwriting for the public schools.” Elementary School Jour- 
nal, February, Vol. 18, pp. 423-446. 
Problem. To determine on a basis of objective measurement the demand 
for handwriting, first in social correspondence, and second, in a series of 
vocations. 
Method. The method of determining the quality of handwriting needed 
for social correspondence was twofold. First, 1053 specimens of actual 
social correspondence were collected and scored. Second, the judgment of 
826 adults as to what they consider adequate handwriting for social corre- 
spondence were collected and tabulated. ‘These adults comprised three 
groups: students in education, educational workers—mostly teachers and 
non-teachers. The quality of handwriting necessary for a vocation was 
determined by measuring or scoring the quality of the writing of 1127 
employees in a variety of occupations. 
Findings. The findings of the first part of the study, which deals with 
the requirements of social correspondence, are presented. It will be 
remembered that these findings are based upon two sources of information. 
First, the scoring of actual specimens of writing, and second, a tabulation 
of judgments. The general fact found in the scoring of the specimens is 
that “only 142, or 13.5 per cent of the total of 1053 correspondents, write 
better than 60 on the scale, the remaining 86.5 per cent write at the quality 
60 or less. The average quality of the 1053 specimens is 49.5.” To put 
the matter in another way, 86.5 per cent of these individuals write at a 
quality of 60 or less on the Ayres Scale. If the average is to be taken as a 
standard, 50 must be regarded as the requirement. If the point which a 
very large majority attain is the standard, 60 should be taken as the 
standard. 
The judgments concerning what degree of excellence is adequate for 
social correspondence were obtained by supplying the parts of the Ayres 
Scale separately to 826 adults and asking them to sort the samples into two 
groups to be designated respectively as adequate and inadequate. ‘These 
judges were composed of three classes: first, 176 members of classes of edu- 
cation in the University of Washington; second, 414 teachers in Washing- 
ton and Ohio; and third, 236 other adults, non-teachers. As between 
these three groups, the teachers, in general, had a lower standard than did 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  
210 DeEpARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
the non-teachers. The non-teachers would, in general, insist on a some- 
what higher quality for social correspondence than would the group of 
students in education and the teacher group. But even the non-teacher 
group, which set the highest standard, more ‘than 60 per cent consider 
quality 60 on the Ayres Scale to be satisfactory. 
The results are summed up by Koos: “In the light of these facts it is 
difficult to see why, for the use under consideration, a pupil should be 
required to spend the time necessary to learn to write better than the quality 
60. There is even considerable justification for setting the ultimate 
standard at 50 as this demand touches every member of society. All the 
children in the schools should be required to attain the standard set.” 
The second part of Koos’ study dealt with the vocational demand for 
handwriting. Handwriting specimens were secured and scored from 1127 
employees in 24 vocational groups. The tabulation of these scores is repre- 
sented graphically in Figures 4 and 5. It will be seen that there is 
large variation in the quality of writing produced by persons in the differ- 
ent vocational groups. Groups 5 to 10 in Figure 4 and most of the groups 
in Figure 5 write with a quality between 60 and 70. It is obvious that 
a considerable amount of handwriting is required in the vocations repre- 
sented by these groups. The elementary school teachers are included in 
this statement. It is noteworthy that the high school teachers write more

poorly than the elementary school teachers and the university teachers worse 
than any other vocational group which was tested. This corresponds with 
the poor writing of the professional group in the study of social corre- 
spondence. 
The conclusions concerning the second part of the study are summarized 
as follows: ‘The quality 60 on the Ayres Measuring Scale for Adult Hand- 
writing, which we have set up as the ultimate standard of attainment for 
all school children for purely social purposes, is adequate for the needs of 
most vocations. ‘This will apply to labor, skilled and unskilled, as well as 
for the professions, exclusive of teaching in the elementary schools. For 
that large group who will go into commercial work, for telegraphers, and 
for teachers in the elementary schools it will be necessary to insist upon the 
attainment of a somewhat higher quality, but hardly in. excess of the quality 
702 
‘The author’s further comments concerning the application of this standard 
may also be quoted. ‘The fact that some will go into pursuits demanding 
a quality better than 60 should not be offered as a justification for requiring 
all pupils to attain that better quality. ... Since all should be required 
to learn to write as well as 60 on the scale for purely social use, to train 
pupils to write this quality is the task of general education; to teach some 
who are going into commercial or other vocations requiring a higher quality 
of handwriting to write this better quality is the task not of general but of 
vocational education.”

Mr. Houston’s comment upon his study is, “Very few occupations de- 
mand high skill in handwriting. If students in school write well enough 
for school purposes, it is believed that their preparation will be adequate for 
social and business uses.” It is to be noted that most of these vocational 
groups wrote at a much higher speed than do school children. 
Investigations by the Questionnaire Method 
In this section is summarized a number of unpublished questionnaire 
studies which were designed to ascertain the opinion of business men con- 
cerning the value of writing and concerning the type or quality of writing 
which is demanded by modern business. “The studies are taken up chrono- 
logically and each is described briefly. 
In 1917, Mr. J. A. Savage, supervisor of writing in Omaha, Nebraska, 
issued a questionnaire to about 200 business and professional men of Omaha. 
This questionnaire consisted of a letter written by a school pupil and a series 
of questions formulated by Mr. Savage. The questions were as follows: 
Of how much importance is good, rapid business writing in applying for a posi- 
tion or in being promoted to a better position? 
Is business affected by the handwriting of employees? 
Is economy of time for both the writer and reader considered by the business 
man in connection with penmanship? 
Is the age of penmanship past? 
Considering the use of the typewriter and of office appliances, is writing still of 
much importance? 
Is it important that boys and girls learn to make figures well with a pen? 
Is good handwriting a valuable enough asset to make it worth the time and 
effort necessary to acquire it? 
Such a questionnaire, especially when sent out by a writing supervisor, 
unquestionably exerts considerable suggestive force in the direction of 
®
-P-A-G-E-213

answers favorable to handwriting standards. ‘The answers, however, must 
be considered as of some value in indicating the opinion of business men 
concerning the business demand. 
‘The answers contained in 79 letters received in reply to the questionnaire 
were classified. ‘The classification was somewhat unsatisfactory since most 
of the answers contained rather general statements instead of the expression 
of judgment on specific issues. ‘The classification, however, is presented for 
what it is worth:

s 79 
One gains the general impression from reading the letters that legibility 
is considered of greatest importance among the various characteristics which 
handwriting may possess. Speed and ease of writing are regarded as im- 
portant but subordinate to legibility. A large number of the correspond- 
ents indicated that good penmanship in an application for a position is an 
important factor. All who mentioned the fact agreed that legible figures 
are necessary. 
In 1918, Mr. H. C. Walker, supervisor of penmanship in St. Louis, 
made a somewhat similar questionnaire study. He submitted to 52 busi- 
ness men who employ office assistants a series of specimens of pupils’ writing 
and asked them to answer the following questions, after having selected one 
of the specimens: 
1. Why do you prefer the size and style shown in the specimen you have se- 
lected ? 
2. To what extent do you consider speed important in present day penmanship? 
3. (a) Has the introduction of typewriters. and adding machines made the value 
of good penmanship of less importance? (b) If so, should the time devoted to 
penmanship practice by public schools be reduced? 
4, Is the specimen you have selected good enough for use in any department of 
your establishment? 
5. How have you found the penmanship of recent applicants? 
The conclusions drawn by Mr. Walker from his study were as follows: 
First, the style of penmanship preferred by a majority of those employing office 
help is more compact than we have heretofore been striving for. 
Second, the attempt we have made to develop freedom in penmanship is in 
keeping with the demands of the business world. 
Third, typewriters and adding machines have not supplanted long-hand writing. 
As one man stated, “The machines have reduced the volume but not the quality of 
good penmanship.” Another man stated, “The machines have made good writing 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    214 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
less important, but they have not made good writing when needed less im- 
portant.” 
Fourth, the standard of quality in long-hand writing for business purposes is not 
high. 
In 1922, Miss Florence M. Smith, supervisor of penmanship in East 
Orange, New Jersey, wrote to eleven firms requesting their opinions con- 
cerning the value of penmanship in business. While the number of firms 
was small, they included some of the largest and best known institutions 
in the country, such as the National City Bank, the Ford Motor Company, 
and the National Cash Register Company. The officers of each firm who 
replied expressed their opinion that handwriting was still important in the 
preparation of children for business careers. 
In 1923, Mr. Arlington Swarts, instructor in penmanship in Washington 
Junior High School, Rochester, New York, addressed a series of five ques- 
tions to thirty-four business men. ‘The questions were put in personal inter- 
views and the Ayres Scale was used as a standard of comparison. All but 
one expressed the opinion that training in handwriting was essential for 
business. In response to the question “In the writing observed in your 
office, where is the greater lack, in speed or in good, plain letter formation?” 
‘Twenty-nine replied that the greater lack was in letter formation, and only 
two in speed. Regarding the quality of writing necessary, twenty-four 
expressed the opinion that a quality of 60 or below on the Ayres Scale was 
sufficient. Nine considered 70, 80, or 90 as desirable, and one expressed 
no opinion. Only seven considered writing of a quality below 50 satisfac- 
tory. 
In 1924, Miss Myrtle Ely, supervisor of penmanship, St. Paul, Minne- 
sota, sent a questionnaire and received replies from 118 business men of 
St. Paul. Over 100 held that penmanship is still an asset to business men ; 
that in passing upon applications for stenographic positions they would con- 
sider favorably one whose penmanship is best, and other things being equal, 
a stenographer writing well would have better opportunity for advancement 
than one writing poorly; and that penmanship is important specifically for 
the following persons: the bookkeeper, billing clerk, entry clerk, shipping 
clerk, salesman, and office boy. Eighty-four replied that they would pay 
a higher salary to a stenographer who writes a small, fluent, “plain-as- 
print” style of penmanship, than to one who writes poorly. The chief 
characteristic which seemed to be emphasized in the detailed replies was 
legibility. 
In 1924, Mr. H. C. Walker, supervisor of handwriting in St. Louis, 
had interviews with representatives of six different types of business. These 
represented wholesale houses, bookkeeping, insurance, railways, salesman- 
ship, and filing. All but the last indicated that speed is necessary, but all 
but two considered medium speed sufficient. Regarding the quality neces- 
sary, one reported 30 to be satisfactory, two 40, two 50, seven 60, and one 
70. The consensus of opinion seemed to be that 60 was a reasonable
-P-A-G-E-215
  
Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 215   
standard. Most of those interviewed regarded the quality about 20 above 
the essential as being an asset. 
Summary and Recommendations 
The conclusions from the foregoing studies and the recommendations 
which are based upon them are as follows: 
1. Standard of attainment at the end of the sixth grade as deter- 
mined by children’s achievements. The average of the achievements of 
children selected at random from various parts of the country is from 
slightly below 50 on the Ayres Scale to about 55. The achievement of the 
sixth grade in two large cities and in the upper half of cities taken at random 
is slightly under 60. With these average or median scores may be com- 
pared the distribution of scores in the sixth grade which is given by Ayres 
on his Gettysburg edition of his scale. ‘This distribution indicates that 71 
per cent of the children of the sixth grade write with a quality of 50 or 
above and that 47 per cent write with a quality of 60 or above. 
Conclusion. So far as the achievement of children indicates it would 
be legitimate to set up as a standard to be attained by the very large majority 
of children by the end of the sixth grade a quality equal to 50 on the Ayres 
Scale. It would be legitimate to set up as the median standard for the 
grades the quality of 60 on the Ayres Scale. The reasonable standard in 
speed at the end of the sixth grade is the median rate of 70 letters per 
minute. 
2. Standards of achievement as indicated by social demand. The 
social demand may be divided for convenience into three divisions: First, 
the demand of the school; second, the unspecialized demand of social corre- 
spondence and individual needs; and third, the demand of vocations. 
a. The demand of the school—The demand of the school for legi- 
bility is probably about the same as that which arises in social correspond- 
ence. The demand for speed is not a definite one but arises out of the 
needs of economy of time on the part of the individual writer. The child 
should, therefore, write as rapidly as can reasonably be expected to write 
without sacrificing quality. The school demand for legibility is the same 
as that for social correspondence. School demand for speed is set by the 
achievements of children and may be considered about 70 letters per minute. 
b. The demand of social correspondence—According to Koos’ investiga- 
tion, 86.5 per cent of adults write in social correspondence with a quality of 
60 or less, and sixty-six per cent write with a quality of 50 or less; 81 per 
cent of the judges consider the quality 60 or more as satisfactory and 60 per 
cent consider the quality of 50 or more as satisfactory. These facts seem to 
indicate that 60 is an adequate standard for the median of the class in the 
sixth grade and that 50 is an adequate minimum standard to be set up for 
each child to attain. 
Conclusion. Fifty is an adequate minimum standard and 60 an ade- 
quate median standard of quality to meet the demands of social corre-  
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
spondence. In speed, the same remark holds as was made under the pre- 
vious section. 
c. The demand of vocations—In Koos’ study it was found that the de- 
mand of the different vocations varies considerably. ‘The clerical occupa- 
tions in which handwriting is an important element demand in general a 
* quality somewhat above 60. The other vocations are satisfied by a quality 
between 50 and 60. The questionnaire studies which have been made indi- 
cate that even in the clerical occupations in which handwriting is required, 
the quality 60 is the one most commonly demanded, although a quality 
above this is frequently regarded as an asset. In a few specialized voca- 
tions, such as addressing, a still higher quality is demanded. Speed is usually 
reckoned as less important than legibility, although a fair degree of speed is 
desirable. 
Conclusion. Training for specialized vocational demands is not the 
part of the elementary school. If the quality demanded by general school 
life and by social correspondence is met, a sufficient foundation will be laid 
for special training of vocational groups in the junior and senior high 
schools. This preparation is made when the child attains the standard 
already set. Some improvement may be expected in the junior high school 
even without specialized handwriting drill. It will be safe, therefore, to 
leave a certain margin for growth between the end of the elementary 
school period and adulthood. 
Final Conclusion. At the end of the sixth grade the child should be 
expected to write a reasonably fluent and a plain, legible hand. More spe- 
cifically each child should have set before him as a minimum standard a 
quality equal to 50 on the Ayres Scale and a speed of 70 letters per minute. 
Those children who have not attained this standard by the end of the 
sixth grade should be given continued drill in the seventh grade or the 
junior high school. The class median standard in quality for the end of 
the sixth grade should be 60 on the Ayres Scale.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SOCIAL STUDIES 
Harold O. Rugg, Lincoln School, Teachers College, Columbia University 
New York City, Chairman 
\ ' 7HEN A PERSON attempts to make curricula for training citi- 
zens in the schools one may take one of two courses. He may se- 
lect the content by an a priori, haphazard, “guessing”? method. He 
may simply write out what should be taught. Or, he may set up a program 
of investigation that will seek scientifically to discover what specific infor- 
mation, habits, attitudes, and ideals should be provided. By this method, de- 
tailed and careful inventories can be made of the specific things or activities 
about which one needs information and skill, and the problems with which 
one will be called upon to deal as a citizen in a democracy, and the qualities 
that best promote one’s participating efficiently in the socially desirable 
aspects of citizenship.* 
The “guessing” method, although by far the most common method of 
making courses for the training of citizens, almost inevitably results in the 
selection and teaching of much content that is either unrelated or rather 
remotely related to the actual needs of young citizens. Research workers, 
school administrators, and teachers interested in the revision of the course 
of study should make use of relatively objective methods for the selection 
of the content. Even more important, they should demand that authors of 
textbooks, used as the basic reading materials of the courses in the social 
sciences, should select their content from the evidence increasingly becom- 
ing available concerning the socially valuable activities of citizens. This 
latter statement is crucial because “under the conditions that are general in 
American elementary and secondary schools, it is the textbook that forms 
the basis of instruction. What goes into the elementary textbook is there- 
fore a matter of vital significance. The relative emphasis that is given to 
various events, the names that are kept alive from generation to genera- 
tion, the points of view that textbooks reflect, the ideals with which they 
will tend to indoctrinate their immature readers—all of these factors de- 
mand consideration in an adequate study of textbooks.’ 
One of the greatest problems in curriculum construction is the selection 
of content. Writers of textbooks admit that their great problem also is to

riculum Construction of the Social Studies.

decide what facts to include in their books. Tradition has apparently 
solved the difficulty by including some facts about the entire field of each 
school subject. A marked characteristic of textbooks is that they are com- 
prehensive. Textbooks in the social sciences therefore tend to be encyclo- 
pedias; they mention many persons, dates, countries, cities, topics, and 
problems. 
It is obvious that under such an organization that textbooks can not dis- 
cuss any one fact in great detail. While the mastery of the facts included 
in the course of study is a learning rather than a curriculum problem, it is 
nevertheless crucial to revision of the course of study because the use of the 
socially desirable facts needed in life is hampered when we attempt to 
teach too many facts and when we do not give sufficient emphasis to the 
automization of socially valuable facts. 
In times past, the inclusion of much content in the curriculum was justi- 
fied partly because of a belief in formal discipline. It was asserted that 
the study of many facts was proper because of the training that this prac- 
tice gave the various faculties of the mind. It was also assumed that be- 
cause one might meet a given fact it should be taught. 
Research of curriculum makers in various school subjects in recent 
years has been directed to the study of the most frequent, the most general, 
and the most crucial content. These students of the course of study, after 
careful tabulation of the comprehensive curricula used in schools and after 
analyzing the results of educational achievement tests which show ob- 
jectively how small is the permanent mastery of the information, skills, 
and appreciations now taught, have carried on scores of semi-scientific 
investigations to discover what facts, topics, and problems are of greatest 
relative use. 
The outstanding value of such investigations is to show us by means 
of impersonal criteria that the facts, topics, and problems of relative value 
are only a small part of the sum total of human experience and knowledge 
in each field and also that the socially valuable facts are similarly only a 
small fraction of the facts, topics, and problems now included in the school 
curriculum. When it is shown that we do include too many facts and that 
pupils retain very little of the content taught them, is it not a sound hy- 
pothesis to experiment by reconstructing curricula and revising teaching 
procedure so that at least those facts, topics, and problems that have come 
to be called “the minimal essentials” shall be permanently mastered? ‘This 
does not imply that other meaningful and needed facts should not be 
taught or that content aside from that ascertained to be socially valuable 
for all pupils—the common integrating education essential to efficient par- 
ticipation of citizens in a democracy—shall not be given pupils in various 
localities and of various abilities, capacities, and interests. But we are in- 
sistent that the most frequently mentioned, the most generally required, and 
the most crucial content—the information, habits, attitudes, and ideals—be 
included and mastered.

Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 219 
  
  This chapter of the Yearbook principally illustrates investigations deal- 
ing with facts, topics, and problems that one probably needs to know because 
he will use them in life. It also indicates relative emphases, for it shows to 
some degree the relative probability that such facts, topics, and problems are 
met by the average citizen. 
This summary report has been organized to serve seven purposes. The 
first is to illustrate four methods that have been used by research workers 
to determine topics or problems. These four methods are illustrated by four 
studies which show that one may (1) ask laymen concerning problems to 
be taught, (2) analyze political platforms for such data, (3) use the judg- 
ment of “frontier thinkers” concerning problems, or (4) seek statements of 
problems in periodicals. —The second purpose is to supply evidence from ten 
studies concerning what facts in history, geography, and civics are needed in 
order to read books and periodicals intelligently. In the third place, the 
report summarizes seven studies that indicate what facts and topics are 
stressed in social science textbooks in wide use in the schools. Fourth, there 
is illustrated the use of the judgments of content specialists. Fifth, other 
ways that have been used to indicate what social science facts are needed in 
life are illustrated. Sixth, examples are given of social activities in which 
people engage. Seventh, the judgments of adults as to the life values of the 
social subjects and activities that were part of their instruction in school 
are reviewed. 
While the evidence from these studies is even yet exceedingly tentative, it 
is suggestive to curriculum makers. It probably constitutes a sound basis 
for the selection of the needed facts, topics, and problems to be included in 
the social science curriculum. 
One should not, of course, accept this evidence as final. Much more 
research is needed. Many of the experiments should be verified by repeat- 
ing the technique of the authors of the studies reviewed. One great aspect 
of citizenship training—the chief province of the social sciences—has not 
been investigated in any high degree. It is frequently asserted that the chief 
job of.the school is to help boys and girls engage efficiently in socially desir- 
able activities that they tend to engage in any way and also to help them 
engage efficiently in more desirable activities. Analyses of the major classes 
of activities all show that citizenship training is an important objective. 
But the particularized activities of citizenship have not been ascertained 
except in a small way. ‘Things that citizens do and ought to do should be 
investigated, and the qualities that citizens should possess must also be dis- 
covered. 
Curriculum makers should adopt a wider view of the problems of citizen- 
ship. To the present time there has been an assumption that citizenship 
training will be well provided for by the mere organization and teaching 
of what might be termed “reading” courses in the social sciences—courses in 
which instruction chiefly emphasizes persons, dates, and events in history, 
place location facts and data concerning climate, resources, and industries in
-P-A-G-E-220
  220 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
geography, and the machinery of government, the powers and duties of 
governmental officials in civics. A “transfer” has been assumed—namely, 
that knowledge of such facts will make pupils behave as good citizens. One 
may well doubt this “transfer”? by merely observing citizens about them. 
An important step in curriculum making in the social sciences, is to dis- 
cover the duties, difficulties, and traits of good citizens, and the situations 
in which such aspects of citizenship are found and best promoted.‘ In the 
social situations of life, will be found many opportunities for training citizens 
in school in the things that good citizens should do. School administrators 
and teachers are trying to make school life like life outside the school—to 
make school a miniature society. Every individual lives and should live a 
social life. A large part of one’s day is filled with social contacts. To make 
these contribute most fully to the proper fulfillment of one’s duties as a 
citizen in a democracy, where the obligations for efficient government rest 
upon every one, is the pre-eminent task in citizenship training. 
Brief Questions At Issue in Curriculum Construction in the Social Sciences 
What are the objectives or values of the social sciences? 
How shall theoretical aims, outcomes, and objectives be verified? 
Issue: A priori versus semi-scientific methods of selecting the con- 
tent of the social science curriculum. 
What criteria shall be used for selecting the content to be included in the 
social sciences? 
What content in the social sciences shall be required of all pupils and upon 
what bases shall it be selected ? 
How can differentiation of curriculum material be made to provide for 
individual differences in ability and interests of pupils? 
How shall one determine the problems of contemporary society? 
What criteria should be used in determining minimal essential facts? 
‘What methods shall be employed to determine the things that citizens do? 
What facts concerning the learning processes of children must be con- 
sidered in the program of curriculum revision in the social sciences? 
Review of Curriculum Research Studies in the Social Sciences 
This chapter of the Yearbook reports summaries of twenty-four semi- 
scientific studies which give curriculum makers relatively impersonal ob- 
jective evidence from which to select the content of the curriculum in the 
social sciences. ‘These studies are classified into four groups: 
I. Studies that Suggest Possible Methods of Determining Problems and Activities 
of Contemporary Society: 
a. Discovering problems by analyses of published writings of “frontier 
thinkers.” 
b. Discovering problems by means of the judgments of representative 
citizens 
1 Two such investigations are now being made by graduate. students in Colorado 
State Teachers College. These will probably be completed by the summer of 1925.

c. Discovering problems by means of an analysis of political platforms 
d. Discovering problems by means of analyses of newspapers and maga-

II. Studies of Minimal Essentials:

b. Studies that contribute data concerning what facts in history, geography, 
and civics are needed in order to read periodicals and books intelli- 
gently

problems, stressed in commonly used school textbooks

Problem. ‘To discover the insistent and permanent contemporary prob- 
lems to be used as a basis for organizing materials in the field of the social 
studies and for promoting a program of citizenship training. 
Method. ‘The theory of Dr. Rugg and his research workers engaged in 
this task is that the best source for the statement of insistent and persistent 
contemporary problems is the published works of the so-called “frontier 
thinkers.” Specialists, who have devoted years not only to the detailed 
intensive study of the theoretical aspects of their specialties, but who, in 
many cases, have become practically acquainted with these problems in 
the field, have been deemed by this group of research workers to be best 
qualified to give an insight into, and a more mature judgment concerning 
the issues of present-day life. 
The published writings of these men have been analyzed partly because 
they afford a more convenient basis for discovering these problems than 
' Detailed analyses of the proportion of space devoted to systematic books in 
each of the major groups of contemporary problems are still being made by the 
research group engaged in the collection and organization of The Social Science 
Pamphlets, the proposed Junior High School social science curriculum, now being 
experimented upon by Harold O. Rugg, Earle Rugg, and Emma Schweppe. The 
results of the entire investigation, now in its fourth year, are being published as a 
series of essays and monographs by Harold O. Rugg.

detailed personal interviews and partly because the published writings of 
such specialists tend to be more critical than the opinions that one would 
get from personal or oral interviews with them. 
To determine who were the ccmpetent specialists in each field, first, the 
books in the social science field \ -re listed that appeared in the Book Review 
Digest for the years 1915-22; and only those books which were rated by 
competent reviewers as of distinct merit were taken for analysis. Second, 
more than 200 specialists in the fields of history, government, economics, 
and sociology and some representative editorial writers were asked to name 
books from which one might be able to find statements of problems. Each 
of the specialists was asked only for lists of books within his own special 
field. ‘Third, these lists were further increased by a critical study of the 
book reviews in six weekly and several monthly journals over a period of 
five years following the war.'' Fourth, a careful canvas of several thousand 
books in the field of the social sciences on the shelves of the Columbia Uni- 
versity Library was made. 
From these four lists, over two hundred selected books have been analyzed 
carefully by this research group for statements of contemporary problems. 
Over three hundred such problems having to do with issues concerning land, 
industry and business, population, community life in the American city, edu- 
cation, governmental problems, and world affairs have been listed. 
Besides these major types of problems within each major class of con- 
temporary issues, the investigation was concerned with the detailed ques- 
tions that these writers discuss in connection with their treatment of the 
problems in their field. 
Findings. The books of “frontier thinkers” listed below are typical of 
those upon which statements of contemporary problems and issues have been 
based. The authors of these books were selected as competent specialists on 
the basis of one or more of the criteria for selection mentioned above.

parentheses indicate the total number of pages devoted to each problem. 
Table 29 illustrates the results of this method of analyzing the published 
writings of specialists for their “opinions” on insistent problems and ques- 
tions. ae 
This study indicates the basic problems and questions in the minds of 
specialists who are perhaps best qualified to state such problems. The next 
two studies indicate other sources for problems: Cocking asked rep- 
resentative “lay” citizens for problems and Bassett analyzed political 
platforms for problems. This study, however, presents the problems and 
questions that the deepest and keenest students of society, according to their 
critics, deemed to be of crucial importance to us. 
Another contrast to be noted between this study and other studies using 
such standards as Cocking and Bassett used is that the latter studies fur- 
nish the basis for making curricula only for children in life as it is—that 
is, they tend to ignore the demands of a rapidly changing society. This

day, but because these specialists have for twenty years, at least, been point- 
ing out these problems and questions, it seems likely that by taking their 
statements or their opinions, we are more apt to equip children for our 
rapidly changing society, particularly in the next twenty years. It is inter- 
esting to note that problems now being discussed were included in the pub- 
lished writings of these specialists in the 90’s and early 1900’s. 
“Are we not delinquent representatives of that agency (the school) unless 
besides making our curriculum keep pace with the changes of that society, 
we anticipate what those changes are going to be and use the curriculum to 
prepare children to meet them?” 
Figure 6 on page 226 indicates how these problems serve as the control 
for the organization and collection of a wealth of materials in the field of 
the social sciences. By means of detailed allusions, pupils doubtless will be 
forced from the organization of material to draw their own conclusions con- 
cerning current modes of living and contemporary problems and issues.

be emphasized in the teaching of citizenship. 
Method. An attempt was made to obtain a cross section of the public 
opinion of the State of Iowa. To do this, members of representative 
classes of society were selected. Over eighteen hundred people were se- 
lected from the following list: 
Buena Vista Grade teachers Business men 
Home makers Working women 
City superintendents Editors

An effort was also made to get a sufficient representation of each group 
—for example, 500 home makers were chosen to represent the opinion of 
the mothers of the states. Many of these representatives were members 
of committees having to do with Americanization and citizenship of their

used to secure proper representatives for each of the groups cited above. Of 
those selected, 593 suggested topics. 
Findings. “The 593 people in their replies as to what, in their judg- 
ment, should be emphasized in the teaching of citizenship offered 4728

  A study of Table 30 shows that some curriculum makers obtained from 
a summary of lay opinion specific points to be taught; for example, duty to 
vote, public health, and payment of taxes. Other topics require further 
and more refined analysis. It is probably of little value to know that one 
should teach individual duties, responsibilities, and privileges of a citizen 
or responsibility of the individual to the community, unless one discovers 
specifically by investigation what the detailed duties or responsibilities of a 
citizen are. Learning is specific, and if one wishes to teach such topics, 
one must discover the specific items that should be memorized or that 
should be automatized. 
Studies are now being undertaken in Colorado State Teachers College, 
following the technique of interviewing outlined by Dr. Charters, to dis- 
cover what duties citizens perform, what difficulties they face, and what 
qualities citizens should possess. 5

America. ‘These persons represented fifteen occupations and professions in 
which the majority of the American people are engaged. They also 
included people from every state in the Union. ‘These people were asked 
to give five or more traits that they considered most essential to efficient 
citizenship. 
Findings. There were 148 people who replied. Different traits to 
the number of 212 were found in a total of 819 that were submitted. 
Table 31 shows the five most frequently mentioned traits and the five 
least frequently mentioned traits as indicated in the tables submitted in 
Miss Breeze’s article.

‘The writer of this article says “that the efficient citizen must be honest 
and industrious, he must be intelligently interested in the affairs of the 
nation, the state, and the community, and actively participate in them, he 
must respect and obey the law and advocate its enforcement. Loyalty, 
patriotism and public spirit must rank high in characterizing him. He 
must have religious ideals developed within him. To these traits must be 
added courage, tolerance, intelligence, integrity, open-mindedness, good 
health, willingness to serve, liberal education, codperation, unselfishness, 
and character.” 
Such a list, although in all likelihood incomplete, is of value for deter- 
mining specific traits to be promoted in any program of citizenship train- 
ing. A much more exhaustive study should be made.

tion, on file in the Library, State University of Iowa, is entitled Civic 
instruction of the American electorate. 
Problem. ‘To determine by an analysis of political platforms “what 
are the most significant and most persistent problems of the American 
people which seek solution through the machinery of government.” ‘This 
purpose was adopted on the theory that there should be civic instruction 
in a democracy to prepare pupils for the intelligent exercise of the fran-
-P-A-G-E-229
Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 229   
    
                                                       
      chise. Political platforms were selected as a source for the statement of 
problems on the theory that these platforms would “reflect”? the issues of 
the day. According to Walter E. Weyl, “The platform does not show 
what the politician wants; but does show what that astute person believes 
that the people want. The superlative value of the platform as evidence 
is due to the fact that it is always addressed to a potential majority.” 
Method. Bassett analyzed the national platforms of all political 
parties since the first National convention in 1832; State platforms in 
non-presidential years from 1889 in so far as they deal with National 
issues; all of the platforms of major parties for 1910; platforms of major 
parties in certain selected pivotal states—namely, California, Indiana, and 
New York, since 1850; all platforms of the parties in Iowa since 1889 and 
the platforms of parties in one southern State. 
Three units of measurement were used: (1) The linear inch, (2) 
frequency of mention—that is, the number of platforms in which a given 
topic occurs, and (3) single platform proposals, i. e., the number of dis- 
tinct proposals under each topic. 
Findings. After detailed analysis of all the topics and sub-topics 
within the following major political problems according to these various 
units and measurements, Bassett was able to rank the problems under the 
following 26 topics: 
   ‘Table 32 shows the rank of the 1. Commerce, Foreign 14, Monetary System 
2. Corporations, Interstate 15. Moral Reform 
3. Constitution 16. Natural Resources 
4. Defense, National 17. Office, Public 
5. Education 18. Parties, Political 
6. Finance, Public 19. Pensions

11. Justice 24. Territories (and Dependencies)

13. Legislation 26. Miscellaneous 
major problems mentioned by all 
parties—by the Democratic party, by the Republican party, by the Dem- 
ocratic and Republican together, and also checks. the five highest ranking 
topics in each campaign. 
Dr. Bassett’s study shows that: (1) Certain problems run back 
through the platforms of the parties because they are inherent in the 
structure of government; for example, public finance, foreign relations, 
etc.; (2) Others are persistent from the economic organization of so- 
ciety—for example, corporations, labor, etc.; and (3) Others are per- 
sistent because there always are groups of people who are. interested in 
undertaking social reforms.

The data show that certain matters of vital interest in times past, such 
as a strict or liberal construction of the Constitution and State rights are 
being stressed less; while with the rapid changes in industry, political 
platforms give more and more space to questions having to do with labor 
and corporations. In the last twenty-five years America has become in- 
creasingly a world power, and one finds more attention paid to issues hav- 
ing to do with foreign relations. 
ation. From the analysis of Dr. Bassett’s de- 
tailed data, one gets not only a crude check as to the major types of prob- 
lems summed up in political platforms, but one also obtains in a certain 
measure the trends or relative emphases to various topics from which it is 
possible to predict somewhat generally the problems of the next gener- 
A difficulty that arises is that the problems listed are not sufficiently 
defined. For example, there are many problems having to do with labor, 
with corporations, and with foreign relations. 
state definitely the problems within each of these fields and then to deter- 
mine the amount of space given to each subordinate problem in political 
platforms. It is therefore necessary to 
More refined analysis, following Dr. Bassett’s lead, is needed. 
Dr. Bassett’s list is valuable as a check upon studies that use other cri- 
teria for determining the content of courses in civics. For example, one 
may well use not only the results of the Cocking study, using the judg- 
ments of representative citizens concerning what ought to be taught, and 
the Rugg study, using the judgment of the “frontier” specialists in various 
fields of the social sciences, but also the findings obtained by analyzing the 
platforms of political parties.

Problem. To throw light upon the content of a course of civics by 
making an analysis of current periodicals. 
Method. First, an analysis of twenty-one periodicals covering the six 
months, October, 1920, to April, 1921, was made; and second, a similar 
analysis of the topics listed in the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature 
for October, 1920, was made. 
The following standards were used for selecting the magazines. A 
selected list approved by: (1) The American Library Association, (2) the 
Massachusetts Library Association, (3) the Reader’s Guide to Periodical 
Literature, (4) three lists recommended for high school use, and (5) a list 
believed by the writer to represent extreme radical opinion. 
‘Those magazines dealing with special subjects or devoted to particular 
interests like juvenile cases and social organizations were rejected. 
Twenty-one magazines were chosen. Table 33 shows the magazines that 
were finally selected for analysis.

After considering the methods of measuring linear space, counting pages, 
and counting frequency of mention, the latter was employed because the 
scoring is simpler. The writer assumed that the topics most discussed were 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  232 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
most important. ‘The method of reckoning was as-follows: Each maga- 
zine in which an item or a group of items appeared was credited with one 
score. Also each topic was credited with one score. A similar method of 
scoring was used in tabulating the Readers’ Guide to Periodical Literature. 
Findings. These tables are illustrative: Table 34 shows the twenty 
most frequently mentioned sub-topics relating to all phases of government, 
economics, and sociology. Study I refers to the analysis of the twenty-one 
magazines listed in Table 33; and Study II refers to the analysis of the 
Readers’ Guide.

Over three hundred different topics are classified in Table 34 with the 
total frequency mention under Study I of 5095, and a total frequency 
mention in Study II of 720. 
From these topics one sees that there is a wide range of types of eco- 
nomic, sociological, and political topics to be included in a course of civics 
if one accepts the theory that these courses are valuable in giving people 
the necessary background to read understandingly current periodicals. 
‘The great difficulty of such analyses is that the topics overlap. Many of 
the topics are so broad that before one can determine effectively what 
should be taught much more refined analysis is necessary. “They do suggest, 
however, that there are outstanding problems connected with many of these 
topics that might well form the core of a new organization of social science 
materials, 
‘The study is also of value if one wishes to make use of current periodi- 
cals in social science classes, for it gives one relatively objective standards 
for the choice of topics found in current periodicals to be used as a basis 
for class discussion.

School of Teachers College, New York City, 1924. ; 
Problem. ‘To determine the relative importance in contemporary life 
of map (geographic) locations of all kinds. 
Method. Many objective measures of importance were combined to 
determine rank order lists of cities, regions, rivers, mountains, countries, 
islands, etc. Map locations were grouped in the following classes: (1) 
Cities of the United States; (2) cities of the world; (3) countries; (4) 
sections and regions within or overlapping countries; (5) rivers; (6) moun- 
tains; (7) islands; (8) bodies of water; (9) states of the United States; 
and (10) railroads, steamship routes, industrial areas, agricultural areas. 
The following are the criteria which were used to determine the relative 
importance of the many map locations within each class listed above. 
1. Population. Used as one criterion for determining relative im- 
portance of cities, both of the United States and foreign countries.  
-P-A-G-E-234
  
234 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
2. Foreign trade. Total exports and imports averaged:for several years. 
Used as a measure for the commercial importance of countries. 
3. Bank clearings. A measure of the commercial importance of the 
cities of the United States. Not found to be applicable to foreign cities. 
4. Area. Used as a minor measure of importance of countries. 
5. Frequency of use by “frontier thinkers” in critical magazines. A 
tabulation was made of every reference to a map location in one hundred 
issues, of the following critical magazines, during the period November, 
1918, to April, 1924: Our World, International Interpreter, New Re- 
public, Nation, Outlook, Living Age, Manchester Guardian Weekly. ‘This 
criterion was applicable to all classes of locations. This analysis gave two 
measures of relative importance of locations. First, all locations in each 
class were ranked on the basis of the per cent of the total number of issues 
in which they were mentioned. Second, the gross frequency of mention of 
places was used as a less important measure. A total of over 28,000 refer- 
ences to map locations was found. 
6. Frequency of use by “frontier thinkers” in critical books. A tabula- 
tion was made of every reference to a map location in fifteen recent, out- 
standing books dealing with world affairs and problems. Such books as 
the following were used: Bryce, International Relations; Angell, The- 
Fruits of Victory; Feuter, World History, 1815-1920; Keynes, Economic 
Consequences of the Peace; Eckel, Coal, Iron and War; and Bowman, 
The New World. The frequency of mention and the space devoted to 
map locations were used to determine relative importance of locations. 
This criterion was found to be applicable to all classes of locations, but with 
varying significance. 
7. Number of articles in all important magazines. The number of arti- 
cles dealing with map locations in four volumes of the Readers’ Guide and 
International Index was tabulated and the various locations ranked in 
order of importance on this criterion. ‘The years 1919, 1920, 1922, and 
1923 were covered in this analysis. This measure applied to all classes of 
location. A total of 20,000 articles dealt with 1086 different map lo- 
cations.

Problem. ‘The use of newspapers and magazines as a standard for de- 
termining the kind of geographical information that the school should 
teach. The theory adopted was that one important way in which people 
may use geographical information is to enable them to interpret more 
adequately references to geographical material in their reading of periodi- 
cal literature. Specifically, the problem was to find by “samplings’’ of 
newspapers and magazines the types of references and the frequencies of 
mention to geographical material. 
Method. Samplings of such magazines as the Outlook and the Literary 
Digest for a period of seven years ending with 1913 were taken. Two 
methods of counting the references were tried. First, counting one for each 
term such as the name of a place or each statement with a geographical or 
historical content. Second, taking each article as a unit in which the refer- 
ence occurs in so far as it concerns a certain type of reference. Dr. Bagley 
says that actual investigations show that the latter method was to be pre- 
ferred. 
Findings. ‘Table 44 shows the percentage of 2237 references to various 
types of geographical and historical material in eighteen journals.

Constitution, and (3) the Constitutional Convention. 
The Departments in order of frequency of reference were as follows:

merce, and agriculture. 
In one rather “popular” magazine, a sampling of ten years shows that

-P-A-G-E-239
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 239 
such as Cxsar, Louis XIV, Jeanne d’Arc, and Luther are also frequently 
mentioned. Dr. Bagley comments that in this magazine analysis, Caesar 
is referred to more frequently than any American character besides Lin- 
coln, Washington, Roosevelt; Jeanne d’Arc as often as Cleveland, and 
Napoleon more frequently than any living political or military character. 
The writer of this report ventures to suggest that certain aspects of 
European history are mentioned with sufficient frequency to cause one to 
consider their inclusion in the socially valuable history to be taught in the 
schools. The most important in order of frequency of reference are: The 
Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Middle Ages, and the Elizabethan 
period. 
This is a pioneer study that attempts to “sample” periodical litera- 
ture in order to obtain data concerning the facts in history and geography 
that one is likely to encounter in what is probably the preéminent sources 
of information of the average adult “‘layman’—namely, newspapers and 
magazines. 
However, there are limitations to this type of study as Dr. Bagley points 
out in an article in School and Home Education for December, 1914. His 
investigation showed that certain newspapers and magazines with large 
circulations had relatively few references to geography and _ history; 
whereas, those newspapers and magazines “that related and discussed the 
events and problems of the day on a broad and comprehensive plane, 
with interpretations and references that involved for their understanding a 
certain capacity of formal knowledge, appealed in general to a smaller 
clientele and had in consequence a limited circulation.” In other words, one 
might argue that the level upon which newspapers make their appeal de- 
pends much upon the extent to which formal education has benefited their 
readers. The belief that communication of ideas and ideals in a democracy, 
if we give all the people the tools of knowledge, will be adequately taken 
care of through newspapers and other forms of current literature should 
be scrutinized in much more detail. 
The use of allusions in several studies in this. section, in all likelihood, is 
but one means to be utilized in checking the socially valuable basic facts 
needed for an understanding of present-day society. ‘This method should 
be further explored.

Problem. To determine items of place geography to be taught by an 
analysis of random samplings of newspapers and magazines. 
Method. The first number for October of the Literary Digest in alter- 
nate years from 1899 to 1913, inclusive, was examined for items in place 
geography. Advertisements, maps, and lists of places were omitted, but 
cartoons were included, “‘because they are essential parts of reading matter 
widely used to make ideas clear.”

In the analysis, geographic names, such as England, were included and 
also the names of people as English in order “to obtain a gauge of the im- 
portance of the country, mention of the activities of the inhabitants was as 
important as mention of the country.” 
“Every reference was tabulated, in contra-distinction to one reference per 
paragraph or article as is the rule in some studies. This was done because 
of the effort to obtain a complete analysis. Places of the most minute sort, 
as the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, were included. Rivers, mountain ranges, 
lakes, bays, channels, gulfs, seas, and oceans were not included.”

One notes by comparing the samplings of Bagley and Charters a marked 
resemblance in the relative frequencies of mention of the principal con- 
tinents and countries of the world. Such studies with other studies listed in 
this section contribute impersonal evidence upon the crucial problem of 
relative emphasis to minimal essential facts.

Problem. To examine this value of history—namely, that the chief 
purpose of teaching history in the elementary school is to make pupils 
more intelligent with respect to crucial activities and problems of present- 
day life or, as Dr.s Horn continues, “‘this study is planned to determine what 
the content of the course of study in history would be if all history which 
is not essential to such intelligence were eliminated and if items which are 
essential but which do not at present appear in the course of study were 
added.”

Method. Dr. Horn’s hypothesis was that he could secure by analysis of 
books dealing with more crucial modern problems at least the sort of history 
or reference to historical material which these authors deemed essential to 
the understanding of modern problems. His point of view was a service 
point of view—that is, to determine what contemporary historians made use 
of in their discussion of present-day affairs. 
He, therefore, asked the heads of the departments of political science, 
sociology, and economics of the State University of Iowa to make out a list 
of such problems and to list the books. ‘Twenty-seven books were listed 
and analyzed, among them being such books as: Adams, Science of Finance ; 
Adams and Sumner, Labor problems; Johnson, American railway transpor- 
tation; Seager, Social insurance. 
The twenty-seven books were then analyzed for the six following things 
according to the outline used by Langlois and Seignobos, Introduction to 
the study of history. pp. 234-235. 
. The percentage of historical material in each book 
. The specific and approximate dates referred to 
. The historical characters referred to wh . The frequency of reference to each period of history. The periods in 
this study were made to correspond to the study made by W. C.

taught in the seventh and eighth grades. 
5. The frequency of reference to each of the more important phases of 
history 
6. Movements, events, conditions, problems, etc. 
Thirty-eight topics similar to the content of the twenty-seven books were 
also used in the analysis of articles in the International Encyclopedia. One 
hundred forty-two such articles were analyzed. 
‘The topics examined in this study are as follows: 
Accident insurance Feminism Pauperism

The most important interpretation to be deduced from the study of 
these tables is that the historical material that writers of books and arti- 
cles on modern problems chiefly make use of is relatively recent. The 
references are principally to dates and persons since the Civil War. 
While Dr. Horn points out that we should have a larger number of 
books analyzed, perhaps one hundred, and also a larger number of articles 
in the encyclopedias, he does say, however, that the returns from the 
books and articles analyzed are so consistent that the data would probably 
be unmodified except in minor items. 
Moreover, he points out that while the investigators scoring these 
books for dates, persons, etc., may have made certain mistakes, neverthe- 
less, because each improved with practice he asserts that the reports repre- 
sent ‘“‘a very close approximation to the material actually in the books and 
articles under these headings.” A variation from true description of the 
data is probably not more than five or ten per cent. 
Summarizing, Dr. Horn does not attempt to answer the question as to 
the complete content of the course but he does say that he has attempted to 
investigate the implications of the following assertion, namely, “that his- 
tory should render pupils more intelligent with regard to modern condi- 
tions, and problems and activities. If one assumes (1) that this is the func- 
tion of history, (2) that the method of research here followed is satisfac- 
tory, (3) that sufficient data have been collected, then there seems no 
escape from the conclusion that present elementary and high school courses 
of study in history are in very serious need of reconstruction.” 
Obviously, this does not imply that there are not other functions of his- 
tory from which one could justify the inclusion of certain material that 
does not seem to be justified from the examination of the data in this study. 
Dr. Horn, himself, says that while the data suggest emphases to various 
items, they do not indicate what the organization of the course should be. 
Hence, we should keep in mind that we need other methods of attack ir. 
order to determine additional values of the material taught in American 
history.

Problem. To determine more “precisely some of the misplacements 
of emphasis in the present day and relatively recent teaching of elementary 
history.” It was a sequel to the study made by W. C. Bagley and Harold 
O. Rugg entitled The content of United States history as taught in seventh 
and eighth grades, that is, both studies were concerned with what are the 
minimal essentials as revealed by analyses of elementary school history 
textbooks.
-P-A-G-E-244

The following criteria were used in measuring present practices: 
“J, Are the relative emphases given to events in the textbooks consistent with 
the emphases given to the same events in standard books of reference? 
“2, Are the relative emphases given by the textbooks consistent with the judg- 
ment of students of history regarding the events that should be emphasized? 
“3. Are the relative emphases given by the textbooks consistent with the need 
for historical knowledge in interpreting current discussions of national problems 
as these are revealed in periodical literature?” 
This particular study by Marston, McKown, and Bagley was limited 
to one type of analysis of school histories—the names of persons given 
prominence by twenty-five elementary textbooks in their treatment of the 
period between 1765 to 1865 in American history. ‘These names are re- 
ferred to in the Bagley-Rugg study under the caption, “The Hall of 
Fame.” 
Method. The frequency of mention of these names in “The Hall of 
Fame” was assumed to be a rating of the importance of these persons in 
American history. 
‘To check these a rating on each of the three criteria above was used. 
1. The “Encyclopedia Ratings.” Such encyclopedias as the Britannica, 
The New International, Appleton’s Cyclopedia of American Biography, 
Harper’s Encyclopedia of American History were used. 
2. The “Historian’s Ratings.” The lists, both. civil and military, in 
the “Hall of Fame” were sent to two hundred and five teachers and stu- 
dents of history in American schools and universities, who were asked to 
rank these in their order of relative importance. “Thirty-three replies were 
used.

3. The ‘Magazines’ Ratings.” “Samplings” from the files of the fol- 
lowing four magazines—the Atlantic Monthly, twenty issues; The Nation, 
seventy-eight issues; Collier's, thirty-eight issues; Saturday Evening Post, 
twenty issues, for a period of ten years (1904-1913) were read and fre- 
quencies of mention under the civil and military lists were constructed. 
The “samplings” were distributed, so that each year was represented by 
approximately the same number of issues. Each name was credited with 
only one reference for each article in which it appeared. 
Findings. Table 49 shows the ranking of the first twenty-five men

  The study shows more of a tendency to overemphasize or underemphasize 
the importance of military persons due to the tendency in the past perhaps 
to stress military history than to overemphasize or underemphasize treat- 
ment of political affairs. 
STUDY NO. 12. Swisher, J. A. The historical information essential 
for the intelligent understanding of civic problems. Seventeenth Yearbook 
of the National Society for the Study of Education. Part I, 1918. pp. 81-

Iowa City, Iowa.) 
Problem. What history is most necessary to the intelligent under- 
standing of modern political problems, conditions and activities? 
Method. This study is based on the theory, “that if a representative 
list of the more crucial modern problems could be secured, and if among 
the books dealing with such problems, those be selected which give the 
clearest statement of that problem, it might be expected that these books 
would contain at least the sort of history, or amount of historical reference 
which, in the judgment of the authors, is essential to a proper understanding 
of the modern problems that are discussed.” Members of the Department 
of Political Science at the State University of Iowa were asked to list 
books which deal in a representative way with modern problems. 
Twenty-two books were given and were used as a basis for Swisher’s 
study. Examples of these books are the following: Adams, Science of 
Finance; Fairchild, Immigration; Haynes, Child labor; and Jenks, The 
trust problem. 
Also twenty-two articles of similar material were checked in the Cyclo- 
tedia of American Government. 
‘The material was analyzed for four types of data: (1) Historical per- 
sons referred to in each book; (2) specific dates and frequency of reference 
to various periods in history; (3) the frequency of reference to the leading

Findings. a. Persons—A total of 563 different names were found in 
the twenty-two books. Table 51 shows the references to the most fre- 
quently mentioned persons both in books and in cyclopedia articles. 
b. Dates—214 dates were found in the books analyzed and 89 in the 
cyclopedia articles. 
The first conclusion that one draws from a study of these tables is that 
the persons and dates made use of by writers of books on modern problems 
are quite different from the persons and dates referred to in school his- 
tories. While some of the names are common to both lists the majority of 
the names and dates in these tables are different. A second point to be 
noted is that the majority of the names referred to and the dates men- 
tioned have to do with recent history—that is, with history of the United 
States since the Civil War. 
c. Historical periods—The percentage of space given to various periods 
of United States history in books and in cyclopedia articles as compared 
with the proportion of space devoted to these periods in a survey of ele- 
mentary school histories is shown in Table 53.

It is obvious that the references classified by periods deal preponderantly 
with those events and movements since 1861. In fact, nearly three-fourths 
of the references deal with recent history as compared with about one-fourth 
the emphasis to such events in elementary school histories. 
The outstanding feature, then, of the historical information essential for 
the understanding of political problems is that this historical information 
made use of by writers about contemporary problems deals chiefly with 
materials in relatively recent times, particularly since the Civil War. On 
the other hand, we should note in Table 53 that whereas most attention by 
the writers of contemporary problems is given to the history since 1861, 
74.12 per cent for example, that elementary textbooks give only 24.67 per 
cent of the allotment of space to the same period. Such a discrepancy 
between the history used by writers on contemporary problems and the 
history set forth in textbooks calls at least for more serious study of the 
bases upon which crucial materials of the past are selected for inclusion in 
the social science curriculum.

of geography for the elementary schools. Unpublished Master of Arts 
Thesis on file in the Library, Univ. of Indiana, Bloomington, Ind. 
Froblem. To determine a list of minimal essentials in elementary 
geography. 
Method. After a review of other studies that attempt to state the mini- 
mal essentials, Mr. Thomas made a comparative study with the Bagley in- 
vestigation by the reference method of the allusions in a sampling of the fol- 
lowing periodicals: The Indianapolis News, The Danville Gazette, and 
Youth's Companion. Four editions of the first two and six of the latter 
were selected at random from the period 1911-1918. 
Findings. One hundred and eighty-eight pages of printed matter was 
found to contain 5027 geographical references. The following tables are 
given herewith for comparative purposes. 
Table 55 compares the frequency of occurrence of various countries 
with the score of each country in the Branom-Reavis study. 
Table 56 gives the ranking based upon the scores according to the 
Branom-Reavis study and the frequency of mention of the largest cities in 
Europe according to the Thomas study. 
Table 57 compares the rank of the chief cities of the United States ac- 
cording to the Branom-Reavis list and the Thomas study. In a similar 
way Mr. Thomas compares rivers, bays, and mountains with the Bagley 
study.

Mr. Thomas says, ‘“The striking difference in the figures for the unclassi- 
fied references is due to the large number of local references in the metro- 
politan and county newspapers. The large per cent of local references in 
the newspapers is an indication of the relative importance of home geo- 
graphy.” One notes there is a rather marked resemblance between the per- 
centage of distributions for the other types of geography.

history and geography; a statistical investigation. ‘The Twenty-second 
Yearbook of the National Scciety for the Study of Education, Part II. 
1923, pp. 216-233. 
Problem. ‘To select basic facts in history and geography by an imper- 
sonal standard for the elementary school course of study in Winnetka, Illi- 
nois. Dr. Washburne assumed that an important function in the teaching 
of geography and history was to make children familiar with the facts that 
are commonly known to intelligent people. The facts frequently alluded to 
in periodicals must be taught if our children are to read intelligently. 
Method. The type of subject matter, generality of distribution, and 
period of time covered guided the investigators in this study. 
Four literary periodicals were selected: Atlantic, Bookman, Century, 
Scribner’s; five popular fiction periodicals: American, Cosmopolitan, Sat- 
urday Evening Post, Ladies’ Home Journal, Good Housekeeping; five 
news periodicals: World’s Work, Literary Digest, Outlook, New 
Republic, Nation; and four newspapers: New York Times, Chicago 
Tribune, Chicago Herald-Examiner, and Christian Science Monitor. 
Dr. Washburne says in respect to samplings of these periodicals: ‘We 
chose about fifteen issues of each of these periodicals, three every third 
year, in such a way that one periodical or another covered almost every 
month of every year from 1905 to May, 1922. In this way we avoided 
seasonal weighting of items, and secured information over a wide enough 
range of years to avoid the danger of overemphasis of purely transitory 
material.”. Every allusion to a person, place, date, or event was recorded. 
Altogether there. were over 81,000 allusions.

number of periodical-years in order to weight the number of periodicals 
containing allusions year by year; (2) the range of years—that is, the 
lapse of time from the first year in which an allusion was found to the last ; 
(3) the number of articles containing allusions to the item in question ; and 
(4) the gross number of allusions. 
Periodical-years gave an almost perfect index as to the probability of 
meeting allusions to the item. ‘Therefore, items were ranked according to
-P-A-G-E-253
       Tue THirp YEARBOOK 253   
their periodical-years. ‘Table 59 shows a few of the most frequently men- 
tioned allusions. 
Before such lists are accepted with any great degree of finality, it is 
probable that other samplings should be taken. Dr. Washburne’s list is 
significant for the range of the sample—namely, over eighteen years—from 
1905 to 1922. One might, however, question whether his list of magazines 
and newspapers is sufficiently representative of the average reading of the 
public of periodicals. Another investigation of other magazines and news- 
papers, perhaps with larger circulations, might well be undertaken. If 
such an investigation agrees in its findings with those of Dr. Washburne, 
we would be in a more definite position to assert that these are the minimal 
essential facts in geography and history that one encounters in his reading 
of periodicals. 
STUDY NO. 15. Peters, Charles C. Detailed analysis of one objec- 
tive of cultural education. Published in Foundations of educational soci- 
ology. New York, Macmillan Co., 1924, pp. 419-424. 
Problem. ‘To find what information is necessary for the following item 
of culture: At least superficial acquaintance with a wide variety of mat- 
ters, so as not to be entirely ignorant of practically anything met with 
in reading or heard about, but also to “place” them at least roughly in their 
setting. Peters asserts that this ability to place references and to get satis- 
faction from it is an important element of culture. The study is included 
here because it is another check upon the informational facts involving his- 
tory and geography in popular literature. 
Method. © Classes of Professor Peters searched through the most widely 
read contemporary literature to discover references to history, geography, 
and the like, because “‘it is in connection with such literature that the typi- 
cal person will have occasion to get the satisfactions and questions.” 
A study of Mr. H. F. Jenkins, of Little, Brown and Company, in- 
volving what books have been most widely read within recent years, was 
used. “['wenty-six ‘‘best sellers,’ including such books as Main Street, Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Shepherd of the Hills, Great Heart, The 
River's End, Heart of the West, and The Inside of the Cup, were, there- 
fore, analyzed for the allusions in which information concerning history, 
geography, literature, and so on, was called for. Local references were 
excluded and duplicates counted only if they occurred in a new setting. 
“Besides these twenty-six novels there were covered in the same way 
twenty-five short stories, four thousand jokes, two thousand comic pictures 
in the newspapers, and the legends of ten moving picture shows. ‘These 
lists were then telescoped and the number of times each item occurred thus 
determined. ‘The most frequently mentioned—-New York City—had oc- 
curred ninety-six times and the others ranged from that down to one time. 
Motion picture shows and short stories were added until the highest one 
stood at exactly one hundred. This ought to give a pretty fair sampling of 
the reading that the rank and file of people do, and hence indicate rather

Findings. The most frequently mentioned items are listed in Table 60. 
Dr. Peters’ study is further substantiation of the basic minimal essential 
facts that one encounters in another source of reading—namely, most 
widely read contemporary literature. With the other studies in this field, 
it should be used to amplify and check attempts to obtain as complete a list 
as possible of socially valuable minimal essential facts in geography and 
history.

of American history as taught in seventh and eighth grades. An analysis 
of typical school textbooks. ‘Bulletin 16, School of Education, Univ. of 
Illinois, Urbana, Ill. 1915. 
Problem. To show the trends and relative emphases given to the basic 
materials in United States history taught in seventh and eighth grades, by 
means of analyzing commonly used textbooks in four periods, namely, 
1865-1874, 1881-1888, 1890-1904, and 1906-1912. 
This study was undertaken under the assumption that the minimal con- 
tent of geography and history as taught in the elementary school should in- 
clude the geographical and historical data with which everyone should be 
familiar, the facts and principles which might be assumed as part of the 
culture common to all of the people, the need for knowing what elements of 
historical and geographical knowledge are now, and have been in the im- 
mediate past, actually part of the common pabulum of elementary instruc- 
tion assumed prime importance. It is the textbook that forms the basis of 
instruction in history in American elementary and secondary schools. 
Method. A careful count of the proportion of space devoted to the 
major periods and to the subordinate topics within each period as well as 
the frequency of mention of important persons in each period was made. 
Out of the latter, the so-called Hall of Fame of important persons in 
American history was developed. 
Findings. The proportion of space which commonly used textbooks 
devote to nine periods in American history is shown in Table 61. 
The more important facts set forth in this study may be summarized as 
follows: In so far as can be determined from the material presented in the 
textbooks, elementary American history as taught in the seventh and eighth 
grades has been and still is predominantly political and military history. 
Within the past fifty years, the emphasis upon military affairs as meas- 
ured by the proportion of space devoted to wars has declined. In general, 
battles and campaigns are treated less in detail than was formerly the 
tule, while proportionately more space is devoted to the causes and the re- 
sults of wars. The lessening emphasis upon the details of the wars is first
-P-A-G-E-256

noticed in some of the textbooks published between 1881 and 1888, and the 
tendency has been general and decided since that time. 
The latter books give a perceptibly heavier emphasis to the facts of eco- 
nomic and industrial development than do the earlier books, although politi- 
cal development still constitutes the essential core of elementary historical 
instruction. 
As regards the treatment of specific eras or epochs, the principal increases 
in emphasis are to be noted in connection with (a) The period 1783-1812 
(especially in the treatment of the so-called “critical period” between the 
close of the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution) ; (b) the 
non-military affairs of the period 1812-1861; and (c) European events 
preceding and during the periods of discovery, exploration, and settlement. 
‘The persons whose names are most frequently mentioned in the ele- 
mentary textbooks are predominantly those who have been most intimately 
associated with political development and with military and naval affairs. 
Variations among the several textbooks in respect of persons mentioned 
are numerous and wide. Most of the books mention a much larger number 
of names than the average pupil will be likely to remember. Certain names, 
however, are made to stand out through repetition. 
Variations in the topics and events which constitute the chief content of 
elementary historical instruction are probably less numerous and less wide 
than variations in names of persons mentioned. There is always a rather 
distinct “core” of topics common to most of the books, and these topics may 
be looked upon as constituting the present ‘‘standardized” content of ele- 
mentary American history. 
Numerous changes have taken place in the construction of elementary 
textbooks in history during the past fifty years. The more important of 
these are: (a) A movement toward a simpler “style” with larger emphasis 
upon clear‘statements of causal relationships; (b) the introduction and de- 
velopment of the “problem” as a method of teaching history, and a conse- 
quent encouragement of “judgment” as contrasted with rote memory, of 
rational as contrasted with verbatim mastery; (c) a marked decline in the 
employment of imaginative pictures as illustrations and an increase in the 
use of pictures that represent sincere attempts to portray actual conditions; 
(d) a marked decline in the use of anecdotal materials; and (e) a larger 
and wider use of maps.

socially valuable materials were included and whether textbook materials 
were organized in accordance with the laws of learning. 
| Findings. Table 62 shows the relative emphases given periods in Amer- 
ican history by authors of textbooks for nearly one hundred years, and 
the distribution of emphasis of one of the most influential committees of 
the American Historical Association—the Committee of Eight. 
From Table 62 one may ascertain the relative proportions of space al- 
lotted in textbooks in American History for one hundred years. It is 
evident that historians are giving more emphasis to recent events and that 
they are stressing military history less.

Table 63 shows that military events are receiving less attention and that 
political and social and economic matters are increasing in importance in 
textbooks. On the other hand, one gains an interesting picture of the 
extent, that such texts tend to fall short of presenting the history that is 
essential to an understanding of modern ways of living and modern prob- 
lems. The history utilized by writers on contemporary life is preponder- 
antly economic and social history, while writers of recent textbooks give 
only about one third of their space to social and economic matters. It 
should also be noted that high school textbooks deal preponderantly with 
political history. 
The totals in this table were, as a rule, scattering references, a few lines 
on a page here and there in different parts of the book. 
Table 64 shows the relatively small amount of space given to basic social 
and economic matters. When one considers that the history made use of 
by students of contemporary affairs seems to be preponderantly of a social 
and economic character, it is evident that we fail to meet social needs in 
our texts. ‘This indictment is particularly serious when we consider that 
the study of history constitutes, for a large part of our pupils, their sole 
opportunity for being made acquainted with the problems and modes of 
living in the society in which they are forced to live and for whose progress 
and welfare they are exclusively responsible. 
In a similar way, a study was miade of the persons and dates referred to 
most frequently in textbooks and by writers on problems of modern society. 
Space prevents the reproduction of these tables. The important conclusion 
to be noted is that the historical personages and dates made use of by writers 
on present-day problems are chiefly those persons and dates in recent history. 
Table 65 illustrates what two investigations using varying criteria of 
social utility indicate as to relative importance of countries to be included 
in the curriculum. ‘Table 65 combines the rankings of the twenty most 
frequently mentioned countries according to two standards: first, the 
frequency ranking in terms of the Branom-Reavis criteria (Area, popula- 
tion, imports and exports, imports into and exports from the United States), 
and the second, (the frequency indicated by figures in parentheses to the

right of the countries) is according to their frequency of reference in news- 
papers and magazines in Washburne’s study. 
It should be noted that fourteen of the twenty most frequently mentioned 
countries are common to the two lists and that thirteen have a displacement 
of five or less. ‘These countries, at least, are in all likelihood countries 
about which children should be taught detailed, socially valuable, facts. 
And further studies are now under way to guide curriculum makers in the 
choice of these detailed facts to be selected and taught. 
To what extent do textbooks meet learning needs? 
Careful analysis reveals the encyclopedic character of the textbooks. 
Table 66 presents the number of pages allotted to a few of fifty-eight 
civic and economic topics in representative and widely used social science 
textbooks. 
Obviously with fifty-eight main classes of topics it is impossible, when 
books are expected to be comprehensive, to give much space to any one topic. 
It should also be borne in mind that these space allotments are totals for 
the books, and in the main they represent a few lines here or a paragraph 
there in the text. 
To quote Bobbitt: “If any one believes the average treatment of these 
topics to be sufficient, he can easily test the matter. Let him send the five 
pages on banks and banking to a list of prominent bankers requesting their 
judgment whether it presents an adequate revelation of the growth of bank- 
ing in our country, and as its outcome, an adequate picture of its present 
status. Let him send the three or five pages on railroad development to 
prominent leaders of the railroad world with a similar request. Let him 
inquire of labor unions if the two or three pages devoted to them present a 
satisfactory account of the development of their present status and relations. 
It is not difficult to predict the character of the replies. 
“For each of these topics, and for many others, there is demonstrable 
need of a full historical treatment. Justice is not to be done to the railroad 
situation, for example, short of two hundred or five hundred pages. This 
should present in concrete, vivid narrative a reconstruction of experiences

involved in the development of railroads, beginning with the early inven- 
tions and experiments, and tracing the expansion of lines and systems to the 
present. ‘The story should fully present the personal experiences of rail- 
road leaders and groups; only as the ‘human element’ is central in the story 
can the reader actually re-live the experiences. But at the same time it 
should reveal fundamental processes and relationships of all kinds; the 
social influences that called railroads into being; kinds and amounts of 
service rendered to different regions; modes of organization, financing, 
regulation, wages, conditions of work, and the like. ‘The story should be 
so written that the reader can see and appreciate the valiant national service 
that the railroads have rendered in pushing back the frontiers and opening 
up the wilderness for civilization; in carrying the means of civilized life to 
every corner of our land; in breaking down isolation, provincialism, and 
sectionalism; and in promoting the central intra-national welfare. The 
story should be presented so vividly and sympathetically that the reader can 
enter whole-heartedly into the action. This provides right conditions for 
leaving large residues of information acquired through living rather than 
memorizing; and the materials and experiences out of which the abstract 
general principles are to be distilled.” 
It is obvious that from present textbooks children do not get adequate 
concepts of common civic and economic matters. 
‘Table 67 shows the amount of space in pages (or lines where less than 
one fourth of a page is given) that five representative social science text- 
books give to the discussion of four housing standards presented in Harap’s 
study. 
Table 67 not only shows the small degree to which social needs, objec- 
tively determined, are taught but also the fact that only forty or fifty lines 
at most are devoted to the host of facts about any one standard is some 
evidence that few real meanings about these standards can be established in 
the minds of children. 
Because of the demands that textbooks shall be comprehensive—shall 
include everything in the field—so many facts are included that details 
about each fact, topic, or principle cannot be given. Writers of textbooks 
give literally their generalizations based upon their own study and research. 
They give chiefly the “texts” connected in narrative form.

If we could assume that every school would use textbooks as guides and 
would also provide the detailed supplementary material, present practice in 
the use of textbooks could in some measure be justified. ‘They could then 
be used as convenient reference books. But practice in our public school is 
preponderantly to use scarcely any reading materials besides the text. We 
ask pupils to spend several hundred hours reading material that any normal 
reader could read in twenty hours at most. 
The authors of textbooks tend to include most facts in the field. For 
example, careful examination of school textbooks show that the typical 
history textbook mentions about four hundred different persons one or more 
times and every date (year) since 1775 one or more times. Also a careful 
frequency count reveals the fact that eight current histories mention 1409 
different persons but that only 1O9 of these historical characters are common 
to all eight textbooks. Stating this another way, each book tends to em- 
phasize many persons in history that in the opinion of the authors of other 
textbooks should be not mentioned. 
The proportion of content that is socially valuable in terms of frequent, 
universal, or crucial use is relatively small compared to the sum total of 
human knowledge in that field. Objective evidence must be employed in 
determining relative values. We then probably will not tend to teach too 
many facts. And we will be in a better position to give details about these 
socially valuable facts so that pupils will have opportunities, in terms of the 
laws of learning, to make such content a permanent part of their equipment 
in the great task of being efficient, intelligent, and informed citizens. 
Finally, when we do this, we can demand the permanent mastery of every 
activity involved in engaging’efficiently in the duties of citizenship, and we 
can demand that pupils exhibit skill in handling the problems, issues, and 
questions of contemporary society.

Method. A long list of dates and events rather commonly presented in 
elementary school histories was included in a questionnaire sent to one hun- 
dred fifty members of the American Historical Association. These included 
high school, normal and college teachers of history, city superintendents, 
and authors of leading school histories. 
These people were asked to rank the twenty most important dates out of 
the list suggested, marking the most important date first, the next im- 
portant, second, and so on. Provision was made for omission or addition of 
dates. Seventy-three replies were used in the final summary. 
In tabulating the ranks, the following arbitrary scheme was adopted for 
evaluating dates: Each rank of one was valued at twenty points, rank two 
was given nineteen points; down to rank twenty, valued at one point; for 
each zero vote, ten points were deducted. 
Findings. Table 68 shows the twenty dates which ranked highest. 
Only five dates—1492, 1607, 1776, 1789, 1812—+received no votes for 
elimination. The “experts” were also asked to add dates to the lists sub- 
mitted. Five hundred thirty-nine additions were suggested but only six— 
1618, 1828, 1860, 1890, 1898, 1902—received four or more votes. 
“The most striking conclusion to be drawn from the investigation is the 
lack of agreement among those who may be considered specialists in history 
as to what constitutes the fundamentals of elementary work.”

the list should emphasize relational facts as well as facts of place. They, 
therefore, set up certain standards for the selection of the facts to be learned

mind that these minimal essentials should tell whether or not the aims of 
this subject are being realized. The aims of geography teaching as listed

Method. The following standards or criteria were employed: (1) The 
area of the country in square miles, (2) population, (3) total value of im- 
ports, (4) total value of imports from the United States, (5) total value 
of exports, and (6) total value of exports to the United States. 
‘Fhe writers assert that “these criteria not only offer objective data of 
great significance in the study of particular countries, but also afford a 
means of measuring the relations of the United States to other countries.” 
Using as their source of data the Statistical Abstracts of the United 
States, 1915, fifty-two countries were ranked according to their relative im- 
portance with respect to each of the six criteria above. 
The fifty-two countries were then divided into quintiles and the rank in 
the first quintile was given five points, in the second, four points, etc., for 
each of the six criteria. The total score of a country on the six criteria 
indicates the relative importance of that country among the countries of 
the world. 
Findings. Table 69 indicates the total score of each country and its rank 
in the quintile on the six standards. 
‘The value of these rankings is that it tends to make one critical of the 
relative importance of certain countries to be studied. Without sufficient 
time to cover all countries adequately, the teacher using this and other 
criteria, such as the criterion of Washburne in his investigation of allusions 
in newspapers and magazines, may make more certain of covering what is 
likely to be the most socially valuable subject-matter in the field of geog~ 
raphy.

Problem. To determine the legal facts with which a citizen should be 
familiar. 
Method. A study was made of causes of litigation as filed in petitions of 
the office of the County Clerk, Johnson County, Iowa, for the years 1907, 
1908, and 1909. ‘This was done on the hypothesis that if one could examine 
the causes which bring the layman in contact with the courts and the law, 
one could determine what knowledge an Iowa layman should have about 
the courts and law. 
Findings. Table 70 shows the number of types of action involving 758 
cases which were brought into the District Court within this period of three 
years. 
These court cases were classified and 50.3 per cent of all cases had to 
do with contracts, particularly such as promissory notes, implied contracts, 
oral contracts, mortgages, leases, wills, etc.; 44.8 per cent with court writs 
involving such topics as quieting titles, writ of attachment, decree of divorce, 
writ of injunction, and estates; and 4.8 per cent had to do with damage 
claims, such as slander. assault and battery, trespass, etc.

We find that laymen should understand the general principles involving 
written contracts, quieting titles, divorce, damage cases, implied contracts, 
oral contracts, settling estates and court writs. Alderman checked this type 
of needed legal information against similar material found in twenty text- 
books in civics. Assuming that in courses in civics the layman gets his 
preparation for any possible legal information that he needs, Alderman 
points out that there is a wide disparity between the type of informa- 
tion that the analysis of the courts’ records shows is important and the type 
of material that textbooks present about the courts. “Textbooks discuss 
chiefly such topics as how laws are made, federal laws, constitutional laws, 
and the like, relatively abstract points that the average layman will have 
little use for.

‘Transactions of a local. nature are the ones that people use or that the 
average layman uses most. For example, nearly three fourths of the 
transactions reported by citizens have to do with local matters such as the 
aspects of city, county, or township affairs. Only about one sixth of the 
space in the commonly used civics books is given to local government. 
While this study is limited to some three hundred pupils in a few schools 
in one county, it does give one some evidence of specific situations in civic 
knowledge needed by the layman. It is but another means of finding out 
how the layman uses social science. 
Obviously, these methods should be employed over a larger territory. 
With such results, writers of school courses in social science could well 
consider revision of their materials in terms of the obvious need. of training 
and knowledge having to do with local government.

Problem. To discover the things that people do or the economic activ- 
ities in which they engage—the essential habits, skills, knowledge, and atti- 
tudes involved in certain economic aspects of life, particularly having to do 
with unspecialized practical activities in the household. 
Method. Information was gathered as to important household needs. 
An effort was made to discover what is wrong with the habits of selection 
and purchase of household articles. Census reports and various reports 
summarized in trade journals, were used as well as an analysis undertaken © 
by the United States Department of Labor on the selection and purchases 
involved in a nation-wide survey of 10,000 families of the most important 
household articles. ‘The research of students of home economics concerning 
food, clothing, and household materials was utilized. 
Findings. There is a great discrepancy between the economic habits and 
information that one ought to possess about household matters and the 
actual information and habits that surveys of consumers’ needs in the house- 
hold show that householders possess. Quantitative data concerning the edu- 
cational needs of the consumer are presented. ‘These topics illustrate the 
kind of data gathered:

Food selection based upon quantity consumed 
Food selection based upon the amount of money spent for chief food commodities 
Food selection to meet the daily energy requirement

are respectively twelfth and thirteenth in consumption—that is, the most 
nutritive fruits are very much underconsumed. 
In a similar way, other violations are disclosed of what scientific dietary 
studies indicate we should eat. For example, there is a marked under- 
consumption of vegetables and marked over-consumption of meat. 
One of the most valuable things about this study is that out of it arises 
definite, specific objectives in terms of scientific evidence. 
These are among the objectives concerned with the consumption of 
vegetables and fruits as illustrated by Tables 74 and 75: 
To give the vegetables their proper place in the thinking and habits of the 
food plan of the people of our nation. 
To use and to think of potatoes primarily as starch foods. 
To use and to think of the green vegetables primarily as foods rich in calcium, 
phosphorus, and iron salts. 
To use and to think of the legumes as rich in protein foods, with an abundance 
of calcium and iron. 
To cultivate the habit of using spinach as a rich and cheap food. 
To use tomatoes less in bulk and more for flavoring, 
To use more dried beans and peas. 
To know the effect of home and commercial canning on beans, peas, and 
tomatoes. 
To know exactly what place fruits occupy in the food plan. 
To use and think of raisins and prunes as foods rich in iron. 
To consume more figs, dates, raisins, and prunes. 
To know the relation between fresh and dried fruits as well as their comparative 
quality and economy. 
To know the relation between fresh and canned fruits as well as their com- 
parative quality and economy. 
In like manner the data relative to furniture woods show that “the aver- 
age consumer has no notion of the materials which commonly go into the 
manufacture of a chair or a bookcase.” 
‘The data also show a marked discrepancy between actual trade practices 
in the manufacture of furniture and the advertisements as to what furniture 
contains. They illustrate the fact that these are probably some of the neces- 
sary objectives: 
To know the common woods which enter into the furniture of the nation— 
namely, oak, sap gum, red gum, maple, birch, chestnut, and poplar. 
To know the relative cost of the chief furniture woods. 
To identify a veneer. 
To adjust the budget so as to be able to buy durable furniture instead of cheap 
furniture. 
To know the relative durability of the chief furniture woods. 
To know what constitutes a complete equipment of furniture in the dining-room, 
living room, bedroom, and kitchen. 
‘The most important thing that can be said about this study is that it 
gives one detailed, semi-scientific information by which one can determine 
specifically the particularized bits of information, habits, skills, and attitudes 
that must be taught about household matters. It is an important theory

of the curriculum making that a careful study of known standards of habits 
and information should be made and the degree to which persons possess 
or do not possess these basic skills and information should also be dis- 
covered. The curriculum consists, according to this point of view, of that 
body of knowledge and those skills, attitudes, and appreciations by which 
pupils can be made ready to engage efficiently in socially desirable activities.

Problem. To set forth the abilities involved in the things that citizens 
do. Bobbitt says a good citizen “is one who can perform the fifty, the five 
hundred, or the five thousand things which the good citizen is called upon 
by his social position to perform.”’ His problem was to discover what are 
the things that a citizen has to do in terms of the abilities that we should 
be conscious of for the efficient performance of these citizenship duties. 
Method. Twelve years of codperative effort on the part of some fifteen 
hundred members of graduate classes in “The Curriculum” conducted by 
the writer at the University of Chicago, resulted in the compilation of a list 
of abilities. After critical examination by twelve hundred high school teach- 
ers, this list was used as a basis for determining the objectives in the Junior 
and Senior High School Departments in Los Angeles, California. | It 
represents, then, the group judgment of nearly three thousand rather experi- 
enced people plus the judgment of one of the foremost students of the cur- 
riculum. 
Findings. The following excerpt illustrates the detailed abilities listed : 
Ability to think, feel, act, and react as an efficient, intelligent, sympathetic, 
and loyal member of the large social group. Large-group or citizenship 
consciousness. Sense of membership in the total social group, rather than 
in some special class. Large-group local consciousness when dealing with 
local problems; large-group state consciousness when dealing with state 
responsibilities; large-group national consciousness when dealing with na- 
tional matters; large-group world consciousness when dealing with man- 
kind’s responsibilities for world coéperation and management. 
The ability of the citizen to do his individual share in performing those 
social functions for which all citizens are equally responsible in the establish- 
ment, organization, maintenance, protection, oversight, and control of the 
specialized groups and agencies into which society is differentiated for 
effectiveness of action. ‘The young citizen-in-training is to acquire those 
abilities which, when adulthood is reached, will enable him to perform the 
following things in connection with the several specialized social agencies: 
a. Sharing fully in an informed and impelling public opinion, which looks to 
the general welfare in its control of each service agency. 
b. Setting up in public opinion and maintaining the standards of results to be 
achieved by each service agency. 
c. Seeing that each service agency aims at the standards of results that are 
sanctioned by public opinion.

IV. Studies That Endeavor to Evaluate the Recreative or Leisure Values of

Problem. To check the theory that the “layman” reads history for 
recreation or voluntarily. The proportior of books published was sought 
on the theory that publishers tend to restrict the number of books of a given 
class, such as history or science or fine arts, etc. to the “buying” demands 
of the public. An analysis of book withdrawals from libraries was made to 
see in what proportion people voluntarily read books in the various fields of 
knowledge. 
Method. To ascertain what books were withdrawn, an examination was 
made of the records of the central and branch libraries of New York City 
for 1913, a year which was free “from unusual influences which might 
increase or decrease the amount of history normally read.’ An analysis 
was made of the proportion of books published of various classes (1913) as 
summarized in The World Almanac for 1915. 
Jordan in his investigation of Children’s interests in reading lends evi- 
dence to the theory that there is an interest in reading history voluntarily 
for he shows that in the reading of such books, aside from fiction, the num- 
ber is large when compared to other types of non-fiction. 
Rugg sent out a question blank to fifty representative public libraries 
throughout the country asking for their circulation statistics for one year in 
each of these three groups: a. A year before the war such as 1911, 1912, 
or 1913; b. A year during the war such as 1915, 1916, or 1917; and c. 
A year after the war such as 1920, 1921, or 1922. 
Most public libraries are classifying their books according to the so- 
called Dewey-Decimal System. According to this system the books num- 
bered in the 100’s pertain to philosophy; in the 200’s to religion; in the 
500’s, natural science; 600 to applied science; 700 to fine arts; 800 to 
literature; and it also so happens that the books on phases of social 
science—history, government, economics, sociology, are classified for the 
most part within either the 300’s or the 900’s. Hence, librarians filling in 
the number of books under each of the Dewey-Decimal classes were asked 
to present the evidence from which could be determined the percentage of 
books in various classes read. ‘ 
In order to exclude as much as possible the reading of such books required 
by schools of high school and college pupils two other questions were asked: 
1. In your opinion, is any considerable proportion of the social science books in 
the 300’s and 900’s withdrawn by school pupils for required readings or by persons 
 
-P-A-G-E-276

276 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
gathering information for programs in civic organizations? If so, estimate the 
percentage of such withdrawals. 
2. In your opinion, would your circulation statistics for books in the 300’s and 
900’s compared with the other classes such as the 100’s, 200’s, 500’s, etc, warrant 
the conclusion that the “lay” public in your community voluntarily reads history, 
geography, economics, government, and sociology? 
Findings. Table 76 compares the number of books published and with- 
drawn for reading for the years 1913 and 1921. 
In the study of books withdrawn from public libraries, fiction was ex- 
cluded so the tables below indicate only non-fiction. About 60 per cent of 
the books withdrawn from public libraries are fiction. Hence, this study 
included about 40 per cent of the entire number of books withdrawn from 
public libraries. se

Fourteen out of sixteen public libraries, in answer to the question, Do 
withdrawals represent required reading of students?, replied “Yes, in about 
51 per cent of the cases.” Sixteen out of seventeen libraries announce that 
the “lay public” voluntarily read social science books. 
This study shows that about four out of the every ten non-fiction books 
withdrawn are books dealing with the social sciences and that half of these, 
in the opinion of the librarians, represent what might be termed voluntary 
reading. All librarians except one tend to support the claim that there is 
a leisure value or objective to be sought in the teaching of the social sciences. 
There is a marked similarity between the proportion of books withdrawn in 
each class of the Dewey-Decimal and the proportion of books published in 
these classes. 
Major Conclusions to Be Drawn from a Study of This Report 
1. Those facts, topics, and problems that are seemingly required fre- 
quently or universally, or are crucial to life needs are, relatively speaking, 
only a small fraction of the sum total of possible facts, topics, and problems. 
2. There is a better basis for including specific facts, topics, or problems 
in the school curriculum when they are discovered to be socially valuable 
by two or more investigations than when such facts, topics, or problems 
are included principally on the judgment of the author of a textbook.
-P-A-G-E-277
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 277   
3. While these investigations deal principally with evidence concerning 
useful facts, topics, and problems, one should bear in mind that certain 
materials may be valuable for other reasons. But any one who wishes to 
justify the inclusion of content besides that selected upon standards of 
social needs herein illustrated should be obligated to report objective evi- 
dence to show why such content should be taught. This specifically ap- 
plies to the justification of material for disciplinary, for cultural, or for 
conventional values. 
4. The rather marked similarity of the evidence of independent investi- 
gations, made upon differing criteria, gives one relatively impersonal evi- 
dence to state what content should be included in the social science cur- 
riculum. 
5. The studies in Section I of this chapter give examples of how one 
may discover problems of contemporary society. While the school is 
obligated to train citizens to meet problems and activities of today, it is 
further obligated to equip individuals to adjust themselves to a dynamic 
society. It is probable that the school should endeavor to predict not only 
the training that citizens need now but also that training which they will 
require to meet the problems, issues, and modes of living some twenty or 
thirty years hence. The best source for statements of persistent and in- 
sistent problems and issues in a dynamic society is to be found in the pub- 
lished works of specialists in the study of society, in the investigations and 
conclusions of the men and women who have both detailed theoretical 
acquaintance and practical knowledge of their field. 
6. The relative probability with which one meets references to facts, 
topics, and problems is probably best evidenced in analysis of the chief and 
almost the exclusive reading of the layman—the periodical press. Although 
there are limitations in the use of this method, such as the fact that widely 
read periodicals tend to contain few allusions to these facts, is it not the 
obligation of the school to give young citizens detailed analyses and practice 
in generalization about facts, topics, and problems, so that they can inter- 
pret them more wisely and form better judgments? ‘These citizens make 
up the mysterious something that we call public opinion. Their analyses 
and opinions tend to determine what is done to promote or hinder the prog- 
ress of civilization. 
7. Not only must curriculum makers provide for practice in problem 
solving about socially valuable content but also they must provide oppor- 
tunities for the development of sufficient skill in the performance of the 
duties and the activities of a citizen. There is available some evidence con- 
cerning what citizens should do that should be included in the curriculum. 
8. The studies that tell in some detail what is now taught should be 
studied so that one will have sound criteria bases for the rejection or con- 
tinued inclusion of content of the social sciences. The curriculum consists 
of that information, those skills, attitudes, and ideals that should be taught 
in a way to move pupils from known deficiencies to scientifically determined 
standards, in so far as their abilities, interests, and capacities permit.

    CHAPTER VIII 
LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 
W.W. Charters, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Chairman 
OST OF the curriculum studies in language and grammar are 
reported in Part I of the Sixteenth Yearbook of the National So- © 
ciety for the Study of Education, in a section by W. W. Charters 
entitled Minimum Essentials in Elementary Language and Grammar. To 
these are added a few others reported in Curriculum Construction, by the 
same author. An additional number, which have appeared since the publi- 
cation of the foregoing, are added in this report. 
For purposes of clarity, we shall adopt the question and answer form 
and proceed without preliminary discussion to the description of the 
studies. 
1. What are the objectives of elementary language and grammar courses? 
In the studies, no distinction has been made between elementary and ad- 
vanced courses. “The assumption seems to have been that those courses 
which deal with common errors should be considered elementary courses. 
One statement and two studies of objectives are reported. The assump- 
tion is made by Charters in the Sixteenth Yearbook of the National Society 
for the Study of Education that the function of the course in grammar is to 
give a rational basis for the elimination of the language errors of school 
children. 
One study of the objectives of language has been made by Searson, which 
is summarized in Study No. 1. His object is to determine just what sorts 
of language skills seem necessary for men in various occupations. Another 
study of objectives of English is reported by Charles Pendleton, and is de- 
scribed in Study No. 2. A third study is reported by Franklin Bobbitt in 
his book How to Make a Curriculum. ‘These are the objectives derived 
by the high school teachers of Los Angeles by the use of methods somewhat 
similar to those used by Pendleton. These are described in Study No. 3. 
2. What is the technical content of language and grammar? 
On the assumption that one function of elementary language is to cor- 
rect errors of oral and written speech, several investigators have studied the 
errors of school children. These are tabulated in Table 77. 
The methods of collection varied in some details and are described 
in the Sixteenth Yearbook and in Curriculum Construction, except the 
study of Sunne, which follows as Study No. 3. The general conclusions 
concerning oral errors are as follows: 
“J, All the investigators agree in the finding that errors in verbs are 
most frequent, constituting as they do about sixty per cent of the grammati- 
cal errors, except Randolph, whose stenographic reports show the verbs to 
be about ten. 
[278]
-P-A-G-E-279
  Tue THIRD YEARBOOK 279   
“2, Because it is a well-known fact that when errors become very com- 
mon they cease to be thought serious and in course of time are accepted as 
good form, the query naturally arises as to whether or not the most common 
are considered to be the most serious. Obviously, the most common are 
serious from the point of view of frequency, but they may not attach so 
deep a stigma to the user as do some much less common errors. 
“With this in mind, the teachers of Pittsburgh were asked to list the ten 
errors which each considered to be the worst. These were compiled. The 
relative frequency with which each was mentioned by teachers and the pro- 
portional percentage which each was of the total ‘worst list’ was compiled.

This percentage was compared with similar percentages of frequency of 
occurrence of the error. It was found for 41 specific items that the correla- 
tion between the frequency of mention by teachers as being one of ten 
worst errors, with frequency of occurrence, was .63 by the Spearman Foot 
tule. This is fairly high and suggests that, in general, the gravity follows 
the frequency when measured in this rough way. 
“The twelve errors in which there was the widest divergence between 
frequency of occurrence and frequency of mention by the teachers may be 
divided into two classes. Five errors were, in the opinion of the teachers, 
much worse than they were frequent. The use of was for were was ranked 
30.5 in the frequency of error list, but in the teachers’ opinion was second

to.worst; learn for teach (18) frequency, (36.5) gravity; that there (4), 
(15.5) ; double comparatives (26), (34.5), and them there (20), (27). 
In seven extreme cases the reverse was true. The teachers regarded the 
errors not as bad as they were frequent. Ain’t got ranked twenty-eighth in 
seriousness in teachers’ opinions, but ninth in frequency of occur- 
rence; give for gave (31.5), (15.5) ; is for are (16), (6) ; misuse of me as

do their work (36), (28); come for came (18), (11); and will for shall 
(iS) is (245) = 
“3. In Pittsburgh, twenty-three specific errors with a frequency of over 
200 constitute 56 per cent of the total. These, with their frequencies in a 
total of 25,676 errors, are seen in Table 78.

  “4. Comparison between percentages of error in Kansas City, Detroit, 
Hibbing, and Pittsburgh is given in Table 79. The two items which are 
listed in Pittsburgh alone are due to the fact that errors in language rather 
than errors in grammar were reported by the teachers. The three items 
mentioned in Hibbing alone present certain interesting facts. The use of 
adverbs instead of negative verbs is illustrated by I never done it for I didn’t 
do it. Words omitted are found in such sentences as, I go basement and 
Mother went Chisholm. 
“This table should be read as follows: The error, ‘The subject of the 
verb not in the nominative case,’ constitutes 4 per cent of the total of 5883 
errors reported in Kansas City, 4 per cent of the 11,207 errors reported in

“Randolph, in his stenographic report of the speech of children, given in 
Part I, of the Sixteenth Yearbook, lists 1412 errors in sentence structure out 
of a total of 2954 errors. None of these are collected from teachers in the 
other studies. This is a significant difference, and although incomplete 
answers may have constituted a large part of Randolph’s list, other 
errors not belonging to this class were present. It is, therefore, quite cer- 
tain that the stenographic report is superior to collection of errors by 
teachers. 
“5. The grammatical rules and definitions included in the course of 
study based on the errors of Kansas City children may be summarized as 
follows: 
A. Nouns 
(a) Definition 
(b) Inflection (1) number (2) case (possessive) (3) gender (slight use) 
(c) Common and proper 
(d) Syntax—(1) subject of a verb (2) subjective complement (3) object 
of verb of preposition (4) the indirect object. (These are chiefly of 
use as an aid in the understanding of pronouns.) 
B. Pronouns 
(a) Definition 
(b) Personal pronouns (case and person, gender, number) 
(c) Compound personal pronouns

(c) In general, the parsing will follow the elements outlined in the fore-

“Barnes, in general, agrees with the foregoing items. Differences are as 
follows: He adds collective nouns, although the one who listens to a 
speaker can only infrequently tell that he has made a mistake in number. 
He also adds appositives in nouns, none of which were noted in the Kansas 
City study. He also adds the plural of demonstrative adjectives, which 
was an oversight in the Kansas City study. He adds gerunds but omits 
negatives and syntactical redundance, which are possibly not strictly gram- 
matical in nature.
-P-A-G-E-283
         Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 283   
“6, An examination of these lists shows that grammar is greatly simplified 
as to both the complexity of the sentences used and the narrow range of 
facts to be learned. Much of the difficulty of grammar is eliminated. Un- 
usual tenses, gerundives, infinitive constructions, and most of the mood 
forms are among those in which mistakes are infrequently made or not 
made at all. 
“In the Kansas City study, it was found that the following could be 
omitted from the course of study which was in operation in the schools at 
the time of the investigation: the exclamatory sentence, the conjunction, 
the appositive, the nominative of address, the nominative by exclamation, 
the objective complement, the adverbial objective, the indefinite pronoun, 
the objective used as a substantive, the classification of adverbs, the noun 
clause, the conjunctive adverb, the retained objective, the moods (except, 
possibly, the subjunctive of to be), the infinitive (except the split infinitive), 
the objective subject, the participle (except the definition and the present 
and past forms), the nominative absolute, and the gerund. 
“It is evident that some of the items in this list could not have been re- 
vealed by this method. For instance, one can not tell from reading 
whether or not the writer should have used an exclamation mark to convey 
the meaning he intended. Again, the material read did not include in- 
stances of the nominative of address where the comma was not used cor- 
rectly; in fact, the use of the nominative of address was very slight. The 
oral sentences reported by the teachers did not include noun clauses, and 
the children’s themes which were read seldom used the complex sentence, 
the preference seeming to be for the compound sentence. 
“Tt is quite clear that a much more simple set of sentences could be used 
for analysis and parsing than are presented to children when it is necessary 
for them to learn to analyze and parse sentences involving subtle rules in 
grammar which they do not naturally break. 
“7, W. J. Richardson and Charters (Pittsburgh) classified the errors by 
grades to see what natural eliminations occurred during progress through the 
grades. Clearly, no absolute standard could be set up, because certain 
errors may be stressed more heavily and, therefore, noticed more sharply by 
teachers in the upper grades. But, if a type of error has completely disap- 
peared, the fact is of some significance. None such, however, were noticed 
except the use of quite childish incorrect forms of the past and perfect 
tenses; and in many cases, due to the reason just mentioned, some errors 
increased in number or total per cent.” 
Concerning written errors, Johnson gives the following order of teach- 
ing emphasis for high school students: 
“(1) Mistakes in capitalization. (2) Mistakes in the use of the apos- 
trophe. (3) Mistakes in punctuation. (4) Mistakes in the use of adjec- 
tives and adverbs. (5) Mistakes in spelling. (6) Mistakes in pronouns. 
not including case. (7) Careless omissions and repetitions. (8) Mistakes 
in the use of verbs. (9) Mistakes in the use of prepositions. and conjunc- 
tions. (10) Sentence meaning not clear. (11) Sentence structure not   
-P-A-G-E-284

grammatical. (12) Mistakes in the use of quotation marks. (13) Mis- 
takes in the case of pronouns.” 
3. How is technical grammar derived? 
‘The rules broken were stated negatively as, “failure of subject to agree 
with predicate.” Then the rules which were broken were stated positively. 
When this had been done, the investigators discovered in connection with 
each rule the definitions necessary to understand it. The rules and defini- 
tions thus combined indicate the technical content of the grammar which is 
necessary to give comprehension of the reasons for correct grammatical 
speech. The results of this method of derivation are given above. 
4, What is the technical content of letter writing? 
Johnson’s investigation is reported as Study No. 5. It deals with the 
letters of college students and is reported because of its direct usefulness in 
the elementary grades. 
5. What carrying content is used in the teaching of the technique of lan- 
guage and grammar? 
The distinction between the technique of language and grammar and 
carrying content is this: ‘The carrying content is the material that is used 
in order to teach the facts and forms of language and grammar. The car- 
rying content may be of many kinds: games, reproduction stories, drill exer- 
cises, picture studies, and the like. 
Two studies are reported: (1) Paul and Charters collected a large num- 
ber of language games used in the classrooms in many cities in the United 
States. These have been published by the Bureau of Education as Bulletin 
No. 43, 1923, under the caption, Games and other Devices for Improving 
Pupils’ English (price 10¢). (2) C. S. Dike, in Education, for Septem- 
ber, 1924, describes the method by which he has constructed 92 sets of drill 
exercises, one set for each of the errors which he lists. He has constructed 
his own exercises and uses them after he has made a diagnosis of the English 
difficulties of each pupil. This method is significant because the sets of ex- 
ercises can be made and used by the teachers of any school system. 
6. How should the subject material of language and grammar be gra- 
dated? 
No studies of gradation have been reported. However, attempts to fit 
the instruction to the common errors of the class or to the outstanding 
errors of the individual have been made. This is done by the use of one or 
more of the diagnostic tests which are given to the children whose individual 
errors are noted. ‘The frequency of the error, its persistence, and its 
seriousness determine the emphasis to be placed upon it. 
7. What differences in vocabulary are found among children? 
Vocabulary studies have not been included in this synopsis because of 
the fact that vocabulary has been construed as being less a matter of lan- 
guage proper than of history, arithmetic, and the other subjects in connec-

tion with which the vocabulary is used. Attention should be called, how- 
ever, to two interesting vocabulary studies which have been submitted. 
W. J. Osburn, in the State Department of Instruction in Wisconsin, has 
examined the vocabularies of immigrant children, as has Miss Nina Joy 
Beglinger and her assistants in the Detroit public schools. ‘These are both

STUDY NO. 2. Pendleton, Charles S. The social objectives of school 
English. Published by the author at George Peabody College for Teachers, 
Nashville, Tenn. pp. 3, 4, 36, 37, 38. 
The investigation reported in this volume is a contribution toward a 
definition of English as a school subject. Scientific in method, it endeavors 
to present a statement of the precise ultimate social objectives which are 
actually set up as goals by present-day teachers of English. 
‘The study comprises four undertakings. First, it brings together, from 
widely diverse sources, a particularized catalog of those objectives which 
have recently been stated by teachers as the outcomes which ought to be 
attained from school English. ‘This list of objectives almost completely 
describes present practice and ideals. 
Secondly, the investigation checks and supplements this catalog derived 
from teachers’ statements of their aims. ‘To this end, it examines specifi- 
cally the English used by many adults in their daily life. The list of ob- 
jectives which it sets forth is thus verified for actual social validity by being 
compared with the linguistic abilities of mature leaders in many commu- 
nities. 
The inquiry undertakes, thirdly, to arrange the items in its catalog 
according to their importance as judged by teachers. It therefore obtains 
appraisals from eighty instructors in English and, by means of a statistical 
combination of these individual ratings, arranges the long list in a sequence. 
Fourthly, in support of this evaluation of the specific objectives of 
English, it studies carefully the range and competence of the eighty 
teachers upon whose several judgments its accepted order is based. 
In both the accumulating and the appraising of the goals of school 
English, the investigation depends upon personal judgments. It does not 
set up an impersonal, objective scheme for ascertaining the facts. 
Method. Several sources of material of this general sort were drawn 
upon to make up this catalog: (1) Direct statements from 272 teachers of 
English, contributed personally to the investigation; (2) similar direct ut- 
terances from about 100 educators, not teachers of English but in contact 
with the problem; (3). all the articles, editorials, notes, and advertisements 
pertaining to English which were published in eleven important educational 
periodicals during five recent years; (4) the relevant portions of 67 stand- 
ard general writings on education; (5) 118 standard volumes about English 
or the teaching of English; (6) 49 state or city courses of study, or
-P-A-G-E-287
  
THE Turp YEARBOOK 287   
teachers’ manuals, in English; and (7) 62 widely used school textbooks on 
various phases and educational levels of this subject. 
To supplement and check the social validity of the catalog thus secured, 
the actual linguistic usages of many adults were also studied. The group 
thus investigated consisted of 2759 individuals residing in 99 widely scat- 
tered communities. All were educated persons, considered to be leaders. 
The many linguistic abilities listed during this inquiry were collated with 
those put forward by teachers as school objectives, with the result that no 
important omissions in the teachers’ lists were discovered. 
In all, 1581 objectives were listed. ‘These were then evaluated by 80 
teachers enrolled in classes in the teaching of English in the University of 
Chicago. A detailed analysis of the contribution of these judges is given by 
the author. The 1581 objectives fell into six categories: (a) language, (b) 
conversation, (c) public speaking, (d) oral reading, (e) writing, and (f) 
reading. The first forty-eight objectives, “the sine qua non of public

STUDY NO. 3. Bobbitt, Franklin. How to make a curriculum. New 
York. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1924, pp. 246-255. 
The problem was to determine the objectives that should be sought for 
in the teaching of English expression in the high school. This study is 
included because it presents a technique which can be applied in the grades 
equally as well as in the high school. 
Professor Bobbitt presented the English teachers of the high schools of 
Los Angeles with his well-known list of objectives, guiding principles, and 
assumptions, and pupil activities and experiences. ‘These are listed in full 
in How to Make a Curriculum. The English teachers were then to draw 
up lists which would apply to English expression in the Los Angeles situa- 
tion. The statement follows: 
“As a starting-point only for the curriculum-maker, we suggest the fol- 
lowing series of general principles and assumptions as practical guides in his 
work. Let him modify it as he will, or draw up another. But he should 
take some position regarding each of the problems here suggested ; and hold 
to it consistently. 
Guiding Principles and Assumptions 
1. One’s expressed language is the objective manifestation of one’s thought; at 
the same time the language is the subjective instrument of one’s thought. 
2. In all language expression, the thought is the primary thing, and the language 
the vehicle; caring for the thought adequately involves caring for the vehicle 
adequately. The latter is done, however, not for the sake of perfecting the 
vehicle, but for the sake of perfecting the thought. 
3. Every school department that is developing power to think in some field 
should develop power to express thought clearly and sequentially in that field. 
This is to be done not for the sake of the expression but for the sake of adequate 
thought. At the same time this is the type of experience which normally develops 
one’s powers of expression. 
4, In every department of the school there should be much English expression— 
for the sake of the thought or content side of the department’s work. The ex- 
pression should be‘carefully organized and adequate—for the sake of the thought. 
There should be as much oral expression by each individual pupil as the limited 
time will permit. There should also be a reasonable amount of written expression 
in each department. 
5. The distinction which the student himself often draws between expression in 
his English classes and expression in the classes of history, science, mathematics, 
etc., is injurious to his attitudes and powers of expression. ‘There should be no 
possibility of such distinction. 
6. The major experience in developing one’s powers of expression is normal 
participation in the thought-life and language-life of school, home, and general 
community, under circumstances where one is mainly conscious of human experi- 
ences and of things objective, and relatively unconscious of the language-vehicle 
itself. 
7. Language activities should be as unconscious and automatic as possible. 
8. One should be made conscious of only those aspects of his language of which 
he must be watchful for the sake of exactness and correctness.  
-P-A-G-E-290
    
290 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
9. One should be left unconscious of those aspects of language which one uses 
properly as a result of unconscious learning. 
10. A diagnostic study of the language-abilities of each individual student needs 
to be made. Where he reveals weakness, he is to be trained; where he is already 
sufficiently strong, he is not to be trained. 
11. Spelling drill for each individual should be centered upon the errors which 
he makes. 
12. Handwriting drill for each individual should be centered upon the errors 
in his handwriting. 
13. Pronunciation drill for each individual should be mostly centered upon the 
errors in his pronunciation. 
14. Grammatical drill for each individual should be mostly centered upon the 
grammatical errors which are to be eliminated, 
15. In discovering the language errors and defects of individual pupils, the 
oral-speech defects of pronunciation, enunciation, voice quality and placement, etc., 
are to be looked after as carefully as any others. 
16. In each aspect of his expression, the student should keep a record of the 
types of error against which he should be on guard. His major task is to 
eliminate these errors. 
17. Only as the pupil is brought to be watchful of himself, without prompting 
on the part of the teacher, is his training accomplished. 
18. Students should be stimulated to attain each objective as expeditiously as 
practicable, and with a minimum of teacher-labor. The more it is done without 
teacher-assistance, through pupil self-direction, as proven by measured results, the 
greater the credit that should be given. 
19. After the pupil has mastered the elements of formal correctness, all depart- 
ments should consider it their function to see that he permits no exception to occur 
in his use of the correct forms. 
20. In the main, matters of form should be made clear only as the difficulty 
arises. So far as no difficulty arises in the undirected language-life of the individ- 
ual, he may better remain relatively unconscious of the technical language forms 
and relationships. 
21. Focusing attention upon the thought is a mode of keeping the language in 
the background, 
22. All teaching relative to matters of formal correctness will be done by the 
department of English. Holding pupils responsible for correctness of expression 
will be a responsibility of departments where expression is a portion of pupil 
experience. 
23. In matters of formal correctness, the major effort of teachers will not be 
teaching but rather holding pupils responsible for self-direction in keeping their 
expression adequate and correct. 
24. Only those facts and principles relative to language should be taught which 
are necessary for rendering thought and communication more effective. 
25. The way to learn to express one’s self effectively in English is to express 
one’s self within normal situations where one greatly wants to express one’s self 
well. 
26. The auditor is as necessary for normal expression as the speaker; the 
reader, as necessary as the writer. 
27. As one expresses one’s self orally, one must feel that there are others before 
him who are accepting his communication in the spirit in which it is intended. 
If they are merely sitting critical of his expression, the whole situation is deranging. 
28. Written expression can be made sufficiently serviceable for training purposes 
only when the writer is conscious that his production is to be read by or to others 
whom he desires to please, convince, instruct, or impress. He must write within 
a normal expression-situation. These cannot be manufactured; they must be dis- 
covered, Make-believe will not serve the purpose.
-P-A-G-E-291
  
Tue THirp YEARBOOK 291 
  
29. When one is expressing himself normally in writing, he must be filled with 
the consciousness that what he writes is to be read by some one, in the spirit 
intended by the writer. If he is merely conscious that it is to be examined by a 
critical-minded teacher, usually the situation is so deranged that the expression is 
not, and cannot be, normal. 
30. Deficiency in normal expression opportunities under school control is one of 
the greatest obstacles to effective training in the active use of language. 
31. The English department has not control over a sufficient quantity of normal 
expression situations to give pupils enough practice in normal written expression. 
32. The student who does not realize the values of proficiency in expression, 
and who lacks a desire to attain it, is not prepared to profit from the training. 
Mere driving him will be of little avail. Results gained are but apparent and 
soon lost after the driving season. The training must begin with laying the 
proper foundation in attitudes, valuations, and desires. Foundation must precede 
superstructure. 
33. The most difficult single problem is how to bring pupils to want to use a 
good quality of English. 
34. In the language itself, the two major things to be cared for are vocabulary 
and sentence structure. 
35. Normally, the vocabulary grows up almost unconsciously out of one’s diverse 
experiences in which language is a relatively unconscious accompaniment and 
vehicle of thought. ‘The training problem therefore is not one of direct teaching 
of words, but rather provision of diversified normal experiences which are 
accompanied in normal ways by the verbal element. 
36. Normally, one’s sentence-sense and power to construct complicated sentences 
grow up for the most part unconsciously out of one’s normal thought experiences. 
As these grow complex, the sentences keep the pace in complexity. 
37. Paragraph structures will develop naturally from the divisions in the thought 
itself. One who thinks clearly, adequately, and sequentially will break his thought 
into its natural paragraph divisions with little attention to the matter. 
38. The organization of the larger unit of discourse is at bottom but an organiza- 
tion of the thought-content. 
39. Because of the sensitiveness of one’s associates to matters of formal correct- 
ness, errors in language-forms of every kind are to be weeded out as completely 
as is consistent with a due amount of training effort. The standards will vary 
greatly among individuals according to original natures and to their social sit- 
uation. 
40. In general education, literature is to be used mainly for its content or 
experience values. It is not to be used as a basis of training in English expression 
any more than history or science. 
41. There is no more reason for tying the English expression up with the 
literature than with the history or the science. 
42. Training for amateur literary production is to be given only to those of 
proved capacity, aptitude, and industry—and who require no great amount of 
teacher effort and assistance. 
43. The general training in English expression is not for vocational literary 
production, nor for any special type of English expression in any vocation. It is 
only for the ordinary oral and written expression of everyday life. 
44. Only those are to be trained for vocational literary production who have 
definitely chosen this as their work; whom studies of capacity show to be fitted 
for it; and who are capable of a large degree of self-direction in achieving the 
skills and understanding. 
45. Special vocations require special forms of writing; training to use these, 
however, should be a portion of the vocational courses and given only to those 
who are taking these courses.   
  
-P-A-G-E-292
  
  292 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
46. The basic aspects of English expression are the same whether it be oral or 
written. This being the case, it should be taken care of as one thing; but a thing 
of many aspects, each one of which should be adequately cared for. 
Objectives of English Expression 
1. Ability to use language in all ways required for proper and effective par-

Pupil Activities and Experiences 
“What should a pupil do in order that he may come to use his mother 
tongue easily, effectively, and correctly? The curriculum-maker will 
probably begin by formulating the statement of the general types of pupil 
activity and experience. Some of the things that he will include are 
probably the following: 
1. The pupil will hear much English of the type which he is expected to use. 
2. He will read much English of the type which he is expected to use. 
3. He will associate much with individuals who use the types of English which 
he is expected to use. 
4. He will have experiences under conditions which impel him to report or to 
discuss those experiences. 
5. In every department of the school in which he has opportunities for oral 
or written expression, he will utilize these opportunities for practice in expressing 
himself as clearly, effectively, and adequately as practicable. 
6. He will discover the kinds of language errors and deficiencies which appear 
in his English. 
7. He will keep himself on guard against each known type of error until it has 
been eliminated and right habits formed. i 
8. He will master the technical language information necessary for guidance and 
judgment in eliminating undesirable language forms.

9. Employing the method devised by the school, he will*assist his associates in 
the discovery of their language errors and shortcomings. 
10. He will utilize the assistance of his associates in discovering his own 
language errors and shortcomings, 
11. He will express himself frequently and sometimes at length under: cir- 
cumstances where he desires to express himself well. 
12. He will acquire ease and fluency in the use of oral and written English 
through abundance of experience in using the oral and written forms. 
13. Before expressing himself he will organize the elements of his thought so 
that the latter may be in proper order, sequence, and relation. 
14. He will have diversity of experiences with innumerable things under cir- 
cumstances where the experiences are verbalized. 
15. In his pronunciation, spelling, and all of the other aspects of oral and written 
expression, he will use the best forms of which he has knowledge. 
16. He will permit no exception to right language forms, so far as possible. 
17. He will frequently revise and rewrite, sometimes several times, his written 
productions.

formulating the details of the curriculum. With a completed and finished 
statement in the hands of the curriculum-making group, they can then 
reduce the activities to the specifics of experience for first-grade pupils, 
second-grade pupils, and so on through all the grades to the end of second-

STUDY NO. 4. Sunne, Dagny. “The effect of locality on language 
errors,” Journal of Educational Research, Volume VIII, pages 239-251, 
1923. 
The problem of the writer is to parallel in Louisiana the studies of 
language errors made in the North by a number of writers and to discover 
the variations and similarities of errors. 
The written work of 4237 children in seven parishes of Louisiana was 
collected for one week. In addition, the written work of 4381 students in 
New Orleans schools was collected, and the oral errors of pupils in six 
parishes were observed by the teachers for one week. 
Table 81 gives the classification of written errors. ‘The frequency rank- 
ings for each class is given by grades. 
‘The conclusions of the author follow: 
“Tn general, this survey of language justifies the following statements. 
(1) The larger groups of syntactical errors hold relatively the same order 
in different localities, verb errors taking first rank, next pronoun errors, 
and next adjective-adverb confusion and redundant expressions. (2) 
Language errors of children are at least of two types, (a) those peculiar 
to the community and (b) those generally prevalent. Hence it is not 
practicable to limit language drill to a definite set of rules. A survey of 
all written work for two weeks will show concretely the specific abuses 
that must be remedied. (3) There are indications from this study that 
syntactical errors may be more readily combated than form errors. The 
latter, though apparently more simple, are perhaps to a greater extent 
correlated with mental ability and clear thinking.” 
STUDY NO. 5. Johnson, Roy Ivan. “Letter-writing: a curriculum 
study in English composition,” Journal of Educational Research, Volume 
VI, pages 423-437, 1922. 
This is a study of the standards by which a good letter may be judged 
and an analysis of defects of students’ letters when judged by these standards. 
These problems are solved by the following methods to determine the 
standards of a good letter. Approximately one hundred and fifty letters 
were contributed by women of recognized leadership throughout the coun- 
try—letters taken from their private correspondence files and submitted as 
samples of “good letters.” To. these was added a collection of literary 
letters as a basis for an analysis of student errors as judged by these stand- 
ards. About 1000 letters from young women of approximately Freshman 
standing were examined. ‘The letters of women were studied in both cases 
because the investigation was made for Stephens College which is a junior 
college for women.
-P-A-G-E-295
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 295   
The characteristics of these letters when analyzed by the investigator 
were found to be: courtesy, informality, humor, opinions about events, 
optimism, a few centers of organization, and good form. These were pre- 
sented in at least fifty per cent of the letters examined. 
In analyzing the student letters, 250 social letters and 750 business letters 
were studied. The social letters were written by young women of college 
Freshman standing; the business letters were written by high school seniors 
who were considering entering college. The category of errors is similar 
to that used in another study reported by Mr. Johnson (Table 82), which 
ran as follows:

A study was also made of the content of the letter according to the other 
six standards of good letters. “These findings could not be tabulated. They 
were expressed in the following terms: 
“When the social letters were examined from the standpoint of content 
and general style instead of from the standpoint of mechanical correctness, 
five obvious weaknesses appeared. The characteristics of excellence estab-

lished by a study of the letters submitted by prominent women (Group I) 
and of literary letters (Group II) have been used as a standard of judg- 
ment. It was not possible, however, to draw reliable conclusions in regard 
to courtesy in student letters. While there were few noticeable instances 
of discourtesy recognizable, the majority of the letters seemed to lack that 
thoughtfulness and consideration for the reader which was so obvious in 
the letters of Group I. A too frequent focusing on self (quite natural and 
excusable in youth) seemed to exclude completely a consciousness of the 
interests of the ‘other person,’ with only a peripheral margin of attention 
at best. 
“Of optimism there was no lack. ‘The objection, if any, would be the 
seeming perversion of a healthful cheerfulness into an unballasted hilarity— 
a superlative gush—innocent of all adequate considerations of fact and cir- 
cumstance. 
“Crudeness in letter-writing is the miscarriage of informality. The use 
of a slangy phrase that offends the sense of propriety, the continuous use of 
beheaded sentences, the excessive use of nicknames and familiar epithets, 
the hilarious and unrestrained treatment of personal experience, and over- 
indulgence in the ‘emotional superlative’ may spring from a mis-directed 
attempt to achieve informality in letter-writing—and there can be no doubt 
that informality is the result—but it is an informality not pleasing to a dis- 
criminating mind. ‘This is the first notable weakness of student letters. 
Evidently the cure lies in the development of good taste, a sense of fitness, 
and in the careful study and application of the common devices of infor- 
mality used by good letter-writers. 
“Inferior humor was evident in most of the student letters in which 
humor was attempted. The two most prevalent humor devices employed 
were (1) interpolated laughter, and (2) the comedy of ‘tragic’ occurrences 
such as the failure of recipes or of attempts to foil the teacher. Many of 
these instances contained humor possibilities which were ruined in the tell- 
ing. Interpolated laughter is, of course, inane and intolerable. A few rare 
instances of it can be found in literary letters which are otherwise un- 
objectionable. The improvement of the quality of humor employed in 
student composition can be accomplished through more definite attention to 
the subject of humor. A sense of humor needs educational direction as 
much as the capacity for musical appreciation. 
“Few opinions, other than exclamatory outbursts indicating approval 
or disapproval, were found in the student letters. Actual count showed 
fewer than ten per cent of them to be opinionative. They were primarily 
‘newsy,’ a complete gossip repertory, a catalog of ‘she-did’s’ and ‘we-went’s.’ 
“Lack of organization about central themes was another prominent weak- 
ness of the student letters. Instead of few centers of organization, there 
were many. The tendency to ‘tell-everything’ is probably a natural juve- 
nile trait, since everything in one’s experience is invested with a certain 
interest; but it is contrary to the best practice as found in the letters of 
Groups I and II. The value of dominant themes in letters should be 
stressed.”

    Major Problems in the Formation of the Curriculum in Elementary Science 
What attainments and mental attitudes in nature study should be ex- 
pected of a third-grade pupil? A sixth-grade pupil? 
What fundamental principles of life and interrelation of plants and 
animals and their physical environment should be common knowledge for 
everyone? 
Can methods be devised for determining relative social values of topics 
which might be included in a course in nature study? 
What part of this knowledge should be acquired before the pupil enters 
senior high school or leaves school entirely? 
What is the order of development of a child’s ability to profit by vary- 
ing sense stimuli? Can we hope to teach children to recognize animals or 
plants in detail? Or is the recognition merely that of the whole? If the 
latter, what are the most important elements in the whole? ‘To illustrate, 
in teaching children to recognize birds, should attention be directed pri- 
marily to color or to form? 
‘To what extent can we hope to cultivate the habit of scientific thinking— 
that is, the habit of observing carefully and accurately, drawing warranted 
conclusions or generalizations, and abiding by the results of testing these 
conclusions? 
How far can a curriculum provide for acquiring such knowledge and 
such habits? 
How can the curriculum be adjusted to the growth of the child? At 
what age level does the child acquire accuracy and a sense of form, color, 
and relationships, and the ability to analyze and discriminate? How do 
his interests change from age to age? Can the curriculum be adjusted to 
such changes? 
What are the errors the child is most likely to make in scientific think- 
ing? Can the curriculum be so formulated so as to avoid these? 
Can we depend upon the native curiosity of the child to uncover worth- 
while problems and projects? In how far must the teacher hold his atten- 
tion to the problem at hand and how far must she supervise the child’s 
selection of pertinent elements? How does this change with advancing 
age? 
Can we so guide and direct that all we wish the pupil to acquire shall 
come through projects worked out by him? 
How early does the child acquire esthetic appreciation of form, balance, 
symmetry of relations? What elements can be introduced into the curricu- 
lum to develop these and other esthetic phases? 
How much appeal should be made to the emotional side directly? In- 
directly ? 
[297]
-P-A-G-E-298
  298 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
How prominent should be the economic or useful phases? 
At what stages should the various phases, economic, esthetic, etc., be 
emphasized ? 
‘What should be the relation of nature study and general science to read- 
ing, literature, drawing, art, etc., and how should these relationships be 
recognized in the curriculum? 
‘What is the proper grade placement of pictures and of poems illustrative 
of nature? What are the relative merits of pictures, lantern slides, and 
motion pictures, and is there a change in this at various grade levels? 
Review of Research Studies in Elementary Science 
STUDY NO. 1. Mau, Laura E. “Some experiments regarding the 
relative interests of children in physical and biological materials in the 
kindergarten and primary grades.” The Nature Study Review, Volume 
VIII, No. 8. November, 1912. 
Object. To determine whether children are most interested in animal, 
plant, or physical materials in nature study and in what phases of these 
materials they are most interested. 
Method. In the kindergartens, first, second, and third grades of eight 
schools in and about Chicago, Illinois, two tests were conducted, the second 
like the first but with different materials. The results are based on the 
returns from some two thousand children in each test. 
The materials used in the first test were: a cat, a pepper plant, and a 
toy engine; for the second test, ring doves, sensitive plants, and magnets 
and filings were used. 
The objects were taken into the room and placed on teacher’s desk. 
The children were asked: “If you could have one of these for your very 
own, which would you choose?” Replies were whispered to Miss Mau or 
her assistants and recorded. In the second test, children fed and gave a 
drink to the hungry, thirsty doves; each child touched the leaf of the 
sensitive plants and saw the leaflets fold together, the whole leaf drop to 
its sleep position; and two children held the magnets near the filings and 
all saw the filings jump up to the magnets. 
Miss Mau then said she could not stay that day to answer questions but 
she would come back in ten days and answer such as they might like to 
ask. On her return, questions were whispered to her or her assistants and 
recorded. She then hastily grouped them and gave a talk to answer them. 
It was hoped that the less interesting materials would fade out of the child’s 
mind, the more interesting would remain, and the number and kinds of 
questions would disclose the answer to the problems investigated. 
Findings. In test one, the children’s preferences were: first, the toy 
engine; second, the cat; and third, the pepper plant. It was feared the 
results were hardly fair, for the choice lay between a toy and non-toys. 
Hence, the experiment was repeated with materials that were equally 
active.
-P-A-G-E-299
  Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 299 
  In test two, the expressed preferences were: first, the ring doves; second, 
the sensitive plants; and third, the magnets and iron filings. The per cent 
of all questions asked for the animal was 46; plant, 30; and physical mate- 
rial, 24. The questions dealt almost exclusively with identification and the 
activities of the objects. Identification: Dove, 40.3 per cent; plant, 36.8 per 
cent; magnet, 34.2 per cent. Activities: Dove, 41 per cent; plant, 47.3 
per cent; magnet, 49.9 per cent. 
Questions implying activity on the part of the child exceeded all other 
activity questions in the kindergarten and declined to grade three. Ques- 
tions about the activity of the object were least in the kindergarten and 
increased to grade three where they exceeded the former sort. 
Questions implying motor activity on the part of the child exceeded those 
implying sensory activity in the kindergarten and grade one: the two sorts 
were about equal in grade two, but the latter exceeded the former in grade 
three. 
STUDY NO. 2. Downing, Elliot Rowland. “Children’s interests in 
nature materials,” The Nature Study Review, Volume VIII, No. 9. De- 
cember. 
Object. To determine whether children are most interested in animal, 
plant, or physical materials in nature study, and in what phases of these 
materials they are most interested. 
Method. A study was made of the questions and observations by boys 
and girls published in thé Science Department of St. Nicholas Magazine 
under, “We Will Ask St. Nicholas About It.” Questions were classified, 
and interests indicated by the number and character of the questions. 
Findings. Of the 742 questions and observations, 61 per cent were on 
animals; 20.6 per cent on plants; and 11.6 per cent on physical materials. 
Boys asked a larger per cent of questions about animals and plants; and 
girls, about physical materials. The average age was 11.9 years for boys, 
and 12.08, for girls.- The most absorbing items under each head were: 
(1) Animal life, of these questions 24.95 per cent concerned insects; 24.27 
per cent, birds; and 18.54 per cent, common mammals. (2) Plants, of these 
questions 36.60 per cent concerned wild flowering plants; 8.5 per cent, 
garden flowering plants; 23.53 per cent, trees; and 14.38 per cent, fruits 
and vegetables. (3) Of the total questions 24.39 per cent concerned 
physical material; of this material, 42.28 per cent related to elementary 
physics, and 16.26 per cent astronomical topics. 
Questions on activities and identifications were the dominant sort; there 
was 62 per cent on the former, 20 per cent on the latter.

Method. Nearly a thousand children of Passaic, New Jersey, were 
asked the following questions: First, make a list of all birds, insects, and 
other animals that you have seen in Passaic, except in a menagerie. Describe 
briefly the most noticeable feature about each of the animals, and tell which 
you like best, and why? Which ones do you dislike and why? What 
interests you most about a plant? Make a list of the trees that you know, 
and of the flowers. Which flower do you like best? What animal, after 
man, knows most? Give reasons for your answer. 
Findings. The acquaintance of children with wild plants and animals 
is very limited. Color was the feature which they noticed most; next, 
sounds; and next, size. ‘The activities of animals appeal more strongly 
in upper grades than do appearances. Favored animals in order of prefer- 
ence: (1) Dog, (2) horse, (3) cat, (4) wild birds, and (5) rabbit. Sixty 
per cent of the boys expressed no dislike for animals. The animals disliked 
in order are: (1) Mice and rats, (2) snakes, (3) cats, (4) dogs, (5) 
mosquitoes, and (6) pigs.

Method. Analysis of thirty-two state courses of study; nineteen from 
large cities, and thirty training school courses from small cities. 
Findings. In the eighty-one courses of study, there were 4812 items of 
animal study, 4588 of plant, and 1548 on physical materials, exclusive of 
geography. The most frequently recurring group of animal studies were 
insects, birds, and the common mammals; of plants, wild flowers, trees, 
and garden plants; of physical topics, fuels, the warming of our homes, 
thermometers, evaporation, condensation, air movements, air machines, 
and magnetism.

Object. To discover whether a diagrammatic drawing fixes in mind the 
facts to be taught better than the customary sketch. 
Method. ‘To experimentally try out various types of drawing with 
several classes of pupils in the high school science classes to see which type 
fixed facts in mind best regarding the set up of apparatus, structure of 
plants and animals, and the like. 
Findings. The diagrammatic drawing is more economical of time than 
is the picture-sketch, and also, even with less time put upon it, is superior 
in fixing in the pupils’ minds the facts to be retained.

STUDY NO. 6. Finley, Charles W. “Some studies of children’s in- 
terests in science materials.” School Science and Mathematics. Volume 
21, January, 1921, pp. 1-24. 
Object. To secure data on children’s interests in plant and animal life 
and physical phenomena. 
Method. In grades one to eight in thirteen different school systems, a 
“Water dog” or “mud puppy” in a glass aquarium was taken into the class- 
room, After viewing the animal for a definite period and without discus- 
sion, the pupils in grades three to eight returned to their seats and in writ- 
ing asked all the questions they desired to have answered about the animal. 
In the first and second grades, the pupils whispered their questions, and the 
teachers recorded them. This experiment involved 1718 pupils. 
A second experiment was tried in five school systems, grades three to 
eight, and involved 827 pupils. A thirty-minute lesson was divided equally 
in a presentation of a topic in animal life, one in plant life, and one in ele- 
mentary physics. For the first, a bird was used; for the second, a potted 
plant; and for the third, a pendulum. On the second day, following the 
experiment, the pupils were asked to write an essay concerning one of the 
things presented. ‘The topics chosen were considered ‘as indicative of in- 
terest. In the second experiment, animal life received most attention in 
all grades; plant life, second; and the pendulum, third. 
Findings. 8328 questions were asked about the animal. These were 
accepted as showing types of interests, and were classified under twenty 
headings, such as, identification, life, history, adaptation, etc. 
STUDY NO. 7. Finley, Charles W., and Caldwell, Otis W. Biology 
in the public press. Bulletin of the Lincoln School, Teachers College, 
Columbia University. 
Object. To determine what biological knowledge is referred to in 
newspapers. 
Method. ‘The complete issues of eleven prominent newspapers for the 
month of June; 1921, and six for the month of November, 1921, were care- 
fully reviewed. A total of 13,796 newspaper pages afforded 3061 articles 
pertaining to biology. 
Findings. Out of the total 3061 articles pertaining to biology found in 
newspapers, 897 dealt with health; 775 with animals; 660 with plants; 
533 with food; 81 with organizations of producers; 74 with general na- 
ture; 47 with evolution; and 14 were fictitious. 
“The conclusion can not be drawn that, since these biological articles 
have been found and since they are clearly grouped into certain definite 
headings, therefore these are necessarily the topics toward which all high 
school instruction in biology should be directed. It may be that there are 
types of available biological information which should be presented which 
are omitted in the newspaper articles. Possibly, also, some needful biologi- 
cal information is as yet unknown to biologists, or if known has not been 
made available to the public press. Possibly the press would publish, and 
the public would like to read, much more biological material of much wider

range, if it were made available. These are questions which the present 
study does not determine, but which should receive later attention. 
“Tt seems safe to conclude further that since these types of biological 
knowledge are going to the public in such large quantities all over the whole 
country, the course in school biology should consider them as part of the 
legitimate foundation upon which to proceed in constructing a course of 
study. Other evidences when developed should also be used in whatever 
ways those new evidences may justify.” 
Otis W. Caldwell and W. H. Meier have been experimenting in the 
organization of a course of study materials for use in elementary science 
with fifth and sixth grade pupils. One principle of guidance has been to 
select those major science topics which are simple enough to be interpreted 
fairly well by young pupils. The problems selected are those relating to 
the use of science in common experiences. Their selection is not primarily 
because of usefulness but being useful and thereby desirable, they also add 
a meaning which stimulates work and thought. The course materials thus 
selected have been tried and corrected through use with considerable num- 
- ber of pupils in different types of schools and in the hands of different 
teachers. The topic headings under which this body of course of study ma- 
terial is now organized are: Some common problems of living; fire and its 
uses; light and its uses; fire control; the water supply; household wastes; 
fire in the preparation of foods; factors in food requirements; production, 
use and care of milk; animals which injure foods; regulation of the food 
industry ; sources and qualities of materials for clothing; home grounds and 
garden; home equipment; hygiene of the home; transportation ; communica- 
tion and recreational science.

SECTION I. EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH IN THE FIELDS OF 
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
In gathering the data for this report, about 150 lettérs of inquiry were 
sent to a list which included (1) all state superintendents of public in- 
struction, (2) about forty city school systems known to be actively inter- 
ested in health and physical education, (3) schools of education in certain 
universities and colleges, (4) a miscellaneous list of organizations and per- 
sons. The selection was made in groups (2), (3) and (4) from the records 
of the American Child Health Association and Joint Committee on 
Health Problems of the National Education Association and the American 
Medical Association which indicate with reasonable comprehensiveness 
those localities where intensive work is being done in health and physical 
education. 
In addition, the Readers’ Guide, International Book Review, and similar 
bibliographies were searched for printed reports of research. 
The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many 
persons who have willingly codperated in the collection of the materials of 
this report. Some of the valuable data submitted to the committee could 
not be included in this report due to the necessary limitation of the scope of 
the report to research in curriculum construction. The committee neverthe- 
less gratefully extends its thanks to all who participated in this codperative 
undertaking. . 
A. Research in Health Education 
The questions which confront the makers of curricula in the field of 
health education can not in any instance be completely and fully answered 
by available research. Nevertheless, it is important to indicate what some 
of the most important questions are, in order to encourage research workers 
in the future to direct their efforts towards the solution of these funda- 
mental problems. 
1. What should be the criteria for selection of subject matter and activ- 
ities in health education? 
2. What standards of achievement in terms of habits, attitudes and 
knowledge may be reasonably set up for completion of the sixth grade? 
Junior high school? Senior high school ? 
3. Health needs are continuous throughout life, without much funda- 
mental variation; e. g., it is always necessary to care for the teeth. Should 
the subject matter of the health education curriculum be arranged to deal 
with all health needs every year? Or, with only a few each year? 
[303]

4. How may other school subjects and activities best be utilized to teach 
health lessons? 
5. In a plan where several school subjects are used to teach health lessons, 
how may supervision be exercised to prevent useless duplication ? 
6. How may the results of health education be adequately measured ? 
7. What methods are effective in securing the interest and codperation 
of the home? 
8. What is the proper place of dramatic materials, fairy stories, games, 
and other special dévices and entertainment features in a program of health 
education? What is their function; what contribution do they make? 
9. What factors in the curriculum affect the permanency of health 
habits? 
10. What factors in the curriculum affect the formation of attitudes re- 
lated to health? i 
The following research studies have a direct application to curriculum 
making in the field of health education. They are arranged in chronologi- 
cal order. 
STUDY NO. 1. Wood, Thomas D., and Reesor, Mary. 4 study in 
the child’s health interests. (Reported as part of an article, “Health in- 
struction in the elementary school’’), Teachers College Record, Vol. XIII, 
No. 3, May, 1912. pp. 10-13. 
Purpose. The problem was to discover the child’s health interests. 
Method. A list of questions bearing upon the subject of health, its mean- 
ing, means of attaining it, etc., were submitted to pupils in the Speyer 
School, New York City, and to pupils in the fourth grade of a New York 
City East Side Boys’ School. In the first four grades in the Speyer School, 
the questions were put orally and to individual children, so there was 
no opportunity for one child to be influenced by the answers of others. In 
the other grades, the answers were written and no names were placed upon 
the papers. No previous preparation had been made, and no suggestions 
were given them during the time they wrote. 
Findings. “In no answer is there any suggestion that the child is inter- 
ested in health in the abstract or as a future beneficial state. His sole 
health concern exists in application and relation to the immediate present. 
Interest in growing well and strong is nowhere indicated save as this state 
gives increased power and capacity for present enjoyment.” 
STUDY NO. 2. Hunt, Jean Lee; Johnson, Buford J.; and Lincoln, 
Edith M. Health education and the nutrition class. New York, E. P. 
Dutton & Co. 281 pp. 
Purpose. This experiment was undertaken “‘to explore the possibilities 
of the nutrition class in a public school; to determine how far a school can 
successfully employ the nutrition class procedure, and in particular how far 
the procedure itself can be expected to reinforce the school’s general pro- 
gram of health education.”
-P-A-G-E-305
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 305   
Method. Classes of underweight children were organized during the 
three years of the experiment in grades 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7. A moderately ex- 
tensive program of health examination, and correction of defects was car- 
ried out. Weekly weight records were made, and instruction was given to 
the children, (a) individually at the time of weighing and (b) in class ses- 
sions, once a week. The first year, the class sessions were conducted by 
physicians; the second and third by nutrition workers with some teach- 
ing skill. ‘The second year, the underweight groups formed separate classes, 
working together in all of their school work. 
Findings. The study presents more conclusive evidence in regard to 
control of environment, organization, and administration than in regard to 
courses of study. 
‘The measurable results of the experiment were expressed in the weight 
records. 
However, the various experiences of the three years during which the 
study was conducted lead the experimenters to draw certain conclusions re- 
garding the teaching program. 
Four general statements are made as follows: 
1. Gains have been largely dependent on initial physical status and propor- 
tionate to the relatively superior or inferior condition of the individual considered. 
2. Gains have been largely influenced by the technique employed for enlisting 
codperation from the children. 
3. Other conditions being equal, gains have been in direct proportion to the 
influence exerted on the home and the resulting parental codperation. 
4. Gains appear to have been appreciably increased when favorable conditions 
directly affecting the nutritional processes have been introduced within the school 
environment. : 
In regard to the second of these points, more detailed statements are 
made. 
1, It is necessary to provide sufficient stimulus to insure the child’s codperation 
in carrying out the prescribed régime at home and elsewhere away from school. 
2. “Evaluation of success and failure for the child must be measured by his 
coéperation and by individual gain in fitness rather than by his comparative 
gain in relation to that of his fellows.” 
3. “. . . the child must be held responsible only for his codperation in such 
activities as his environment affords.” 
4. “Thus the success of the school program of health education is dependent on 
a serious program of education in the community.” 
5, Analysis of the activities provided in the nutrition class shows two types, 
(a) those affecting the child experiences at first hand, and (b) those affording 
informational (verbal) experiences. ‘The true place of subject matter is to re- 
inforce and interpret first-hand experiences in a program where health habits 
are the objectives. 
STUDY NO. 3. Davis, Walter W. “The questionnaire method in 
health education.” Chicago. The Elementary School Journal, Vol. 23, 
January. 1923. pp. 373-386. 
Purpose. “The main purpose of the investigation was to get at the real 
facts about the children’s health and surroundings. “These facts were to 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
    306 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
form the basis of a practical course in hygiene for each teacher, for, it was 
presumed, the answers of each group of pupils would determine the in- 
struction which that group needed and therefore, the instruction which the 
teacher should emphasize.” 
Method. In February, 1920, a set of hygiene questions was submitted 
to the pupils of 12 grade schools in Seattle. The results were so promising 
that the list, slightly revised, was submitted to Grades IV to VIII in all 
the schools of the city in October, 1920; May, 1921; October, 1921; and 
May, 1922. About 22,000 pupils answered the questions each time they 
were submitted. ‘The list of questions included 24 questions about simple 
habits and health conditions, phrased to be answered by “Yes” and ‘“‘No.” 
The method of compiling records was simple. The teacher computed 
for her room the percentage of “Yes” answers to the various questions and 
the central office then computed school and city averages from the teachers’ 
reports. 
No systematic specific attempt to base the course of study immediately 
upon the results of the questionnaire is reported. The results of the ques- 
tionnaire seem to have offered guidance in curriculum construction only 
in a general way. 
Findings. a. There was improvement in practice of health habits as a 
result of the work done.

Note: The “fractional basis” means that the percentage of gain is reached by 
using the number of pupils who needed to improve as a basis (this would be only 
a fraction of all the pupils) and computing what percentage of this number 
actually did improve. The “100 per cent” basis means that the total number of 
pupils was used as a basis for. computing percentage of improvement.   
Mr. Davis concludes that “‘the questionnaire has proved helpful to the 
teacher, indicating to her what phases of hygiene to stress.” 
b. Since the use of the questionnaire method in surveying health condi- 
tions is coming constantly into more general use, it is an important question 
whether or not the questionnaire submitted directly to the pupils gives 
reliable information. Mr. Davis concludes that the replies given by the 
children were fairly reliable, ‘“‘since the reported results were consistent and 
supported by general knowledge and experience, and by our specific knowl- 
edge about the individual schools.”

Purpose. The problem of this research was to ascertain what achieve- 
ments in health, practical efficiency, citizenship and leisure may be expected 
’ of children of various stages of development. Only health achievements 
are here reported. 
Method. The “Achievements” were grouped and listed carefully and 
passed out to the forty-six teachers in the department. ‘Three different 
groups of children were then measured: 
Group 1. 519 children just entering kindergarten from their homes. ‘These 
x children were observed and checked during their first two weeks of kindergarten 
experience. 
Group 2. 635 children just passing into first grade from kindergarten, who were 
measured just before promotion. 
Group 3. 638 children passing from first grade into second grade, who were 
also checked just before promotion. 
In order to determine whether or not a child had achieved a habit, skill, 
knowledge, or appreciation, close observation and study of each individual 
child was necessary. A habit was considered to be properly established 
when the activity was repeated four or five consecutive days with no trans- 
gressions. 
A skill was considered achieved when a child showed ability in any given 
activity in keeping with his stage of development. Knowledge was not 
difficult to measure with children’s free conversation, record summaries, and 
child study charts for reference. ‘The matter of appreciations were checked 
by the child’s emotional response to specific situations. 
Findings. The statistics from the eleven different schools and thirty- 
three groups were then compiled and the percentages of total number of 
children in each group having achieved the given habits, skills, etc., were 
tabulated. In most instances, growth in achievement from that of children 
of little kindergarten experience to that of children having had both kinder- 
garten and first-grade experience may be noted. ‘The results are sum- 
marized in Table 84. As a result of revision, a list of home achievements 
which may be expected of a child on his entrance to kindergarten is in the 
process of development. 
Note: The committee of Kalamazoo teachers who are carrying on this work 
expressed some reluctance to have these tentative results published, since they are 
still being worked over, and a new revision will appear in January, 1925 or soon 
thereafter. However, upon request, they submitted their findings to the Yearbook 
with the statement that this is not to be regarded as a finished piece of work, but 
as a beginning.

ues—A scale for measuring health. Chapter XV—Yearbook for the New 
York City Association for Scientific Study of Education. Yonkers, N. Y. 
World Book Company. 1924. pp. 160-172. 
Purpose. The problem was to devise a scale for measuring not merely 
what the child knows, but primarily for measuring the extent to which 
skills, knowledges, and attitudes function in the individual in his social 
relationships. This study deals with measurement of one group of social 
values—that is, those related to health. 
Method. (a) ‘The first step in the construction of the scale was the 
determination of the health practices which are essential to the individual’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  
Tue THirp YEARBOOK 309   
health. The health régime of the open air school, the literature and experi- 
ence of experts were the sources from which the tentative list of desirable 
health practices was compiled. 
(b) The next step was to estimate the value to be assigned to each item 
in the scale. ‘This was first decided upon by judgment of those engaged in 
health work. 
(c) At this point, experimental work began. ‘Three hundred children 
were selected from the children in elementary and junior high schools. 
Half of these children were selected from the best conditioned pupils, and 
half from the worst conditioned. ‘The selection was made by medical 
inspectors or nurses. The children were examined to determine whether 
a positive correlation appeared between their practices and their health con- 
ditions. 
‘The correlation was marked. Eighty-five per cent of those rated as good 
or excellent in health by the doctors and nurses were distributed in the 
upper range of the scale, or received more than 124-178 out of a possible 
247-355 points, while a similar proportion of those rated unsatisfactory 
by these experts ranged in the lower half or below 124-178 points. 
(d) Following this preliminary experimentation, the scale was used 
with fifty thousand school children of the elementary and high schools, 
with the result that standards of achievement were set up for each grade, 
and the points were arranged in the light of experience to make a five- 
hundred point scale. The standard of achievement was determined not by 
the median, but by the accomplishment of the best conditioned children. 
Findings. a. The correlation between health practices and the actual 
health of the individual is high enough to warrant the conclusion that there 
was a close relationship between the health practices as outlined in the 
scale, and the health condition of the children as determined by the medical 
examination. : 
b. “The possibilities of measurement of social values of education by use 
of the health scale are best indicated by the values of its use already appear- 
ing from the experiments so far carried out. Some of these are summarized 
in the following statements from those using the scale: 
(1) “The scale acquaints the pupil with clear, definite concise facts, 
indicating what practices are essential for health. 
(2) “Because the scale can be scored and the results compared with 
standards, the scale motivates health instruction. 
(3) “The scale provides a valuable outline for the teacher to follow, 
and provides her with a standard for judging the health practices 
of children. It makes her conscious of health needs. 
(4) “Since the emphasis is upon practices, the hygiene work will carry 
over into the home, resulting in closer cooperation at home and 
school. 
(5) “The scale turns the attention of the teacher from the immediate 
school objectives to life’s practices, with a general beneficial effect 
not only on instruction in health, but other instruction as well. 
   
-P-A-G-E-310
    310 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
“Tt is safe to generalize from the experience in the use of the health 
scale (1) that the methods of measurement may be refined to the point of 
adequate tests of instruction; (2) that appropriate standards may be set up 
for guidance, and that similar scales may be constructed which will measure 
the social results of instruction and provide standards for other social objec- 
tives.”

Antonio, Texas, as a basis of the reconstruction of the curriculum in health 
and safety education. Unpublished manuscript in possession of author, 
Professor of Educational Sociology, New York Univ., New York City. 
Purpose. The problem was to determine the health and safety needs of 
children in San Antonio, Texas, as a basis of the requirements of the recon- 
struction of the curriculum in that city, and insofar as the facts are typical 
the reconstruction for the whole state in health and safety education. 
Method. The method was a survey of three typical schools, each 
representing a stratum of the population, namely: the negro school, the 
school for Mexican children, and the school for native-born white children. 
The method of gathering data was through the use of: (1) the Payne 
health scale; (2) statements of children as to the food consumed during 
one day, as a check up against the data gathered from the scale; and (3) 
teachers’ observations. The attempt was made to discover the practices of 
the children relating to food, air, drink, exercise, sleep, posture, cleanliness, 
cleanliness of clothing, safety and civic practices. 
Findings. The results indicate that a study of an examination of chil- 
dren’s needs in health and safety is necessary in any community before the 
educational process can go on intelligently and profitably. The survey dis- 
covered that on the whole the white children showed the best health prac- 
tices, the Mexicans next, and the negroes, the worst. However, in certain 
items such as sleep and exercise the needs of the white children were greater 
than those of either the colored or the Mexican. While it was found 
that approximately 50 per cent of the children fail to observe health prac- 
tices necessary to normal growth, both mentally and physically, it is neces- 
sary to discover in any particular school, grade, or room which of the chil- 
dren are engaging in unsatisfactory practices and center instruction upon 
those having different needs. The conclusion from this study is that before 
education in health and in safety begins, at least the specific needs of chil- 
dren should be determined. So far as any general conclusions may be 
drawn they are to the effect that the conclusion from any survey of this 
kind may be used as a starting-point for the determination of the needs of 
children of other communities, but the needs of any community must be 
discovered, as they vary greatly. The health practices also vary according 
to local customs and conditions.

Purpose. To construct a test of general health information and through 
the test to find out, among other things, what health knowledge children 
of different grades have acquired. 
Method. The test thus far has been given in two New York City 
schools in grades 3-8 to approximately 350 children and the per cent of 
correct responses to each exercise has been calculated. 
Significance in curriculum construction: 
If the tests are given in schools in various parts of the country where 
good instruction in health has been given, and if the children in a certain 
grade fail to acquire knowledge of certain facts, this would indicate that 
these facts are not suitable to the learning capacity of children of that age. 
This information would give an experimental basis for placing a given 
fact or group of facts in a certain grade. 
A few of the specific facts found to be most difficult for the group tested 
were: 
The common house fly is usually hatched in manure. 
Pneumonia is directly caused by bacteria. 
Cold baths are good for most people. 
The average number of calories in a glass of whole milk is 150. 
The gastric juice begins the digestion of meat. 
The man who did the most to establish the germ theory of disease was Pasteur. 
Protein is needed for building muscle. 
In general, the more difficult facts were physiological facts, bacteriological 
and the technical aspects of an adequate diet, specific knowledge such as the 
distance away from the eyes one should hold a book and the best temperature 
for a room. 
Some of the facts found to be easiest for this group of children were: 
The best food to eat with cereal is milk. 
Just before meal time the most important thing to do is to wash hands and face. 
At meal time we should sit down at the table and eat slowly. 
Fruits and vegetables are good for us because they help keep us well. 
The same towel can safely be used by only one person. 
A good food to choose for breakfast is hot cereal. 
There is less danger of your. giving a cold to some one else if you cover your 
face when coughing and sneezing. 
Which do you think is best for a child to drink—coffee, soda, tea, milk, cereal 
coffee? (to be answered by underlining correct word). 
Three good foods to choose for lunch are hot soup, baked potato, and milk. 
In general, the easiest facts were a statement of the simple fundamental 
health habits, a knowledge of which are good foods to choose, and general 
statements such as fruits are healthful, and “a kitchen should be kept 
clean.” 
B. Physical Education Studies 
Some of the important questions which the maker of a curriculum in 
physical education must meet are as follows: 
1. Has the “job or community analysis’ been applied to the specific 
situation in order that definite objectives or needs may be revealed ?
-P-A-G-E-312
  
S12) DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
2. Have all phases of the program been subjected to scientific investiga- 
tion and selected on their merit instead of being accepted because of tradi- 
tional use? 
3. Does the program fit into the plan of general education in your com- 
munity, i. e., are they properly correlated and codrdinated ? 
4. Has sufficient time been provided to assure a reasonable achievement 
of objectives? 
5. What plan has been adopted for training the classroom teacher to 
effectively carry on the program in the elementary school ? 
6. Is the program of activities well balanced so as to avoid an over 
abundance of any one particular phase of the work? 
7. Has provision been made for after-school activity ? 
8. Can the objectives be effectively measured ? 
9. Is the program so constructed as to eliminate the possibility of nervous 
or muscular strain? 
10. Is the program graded in keeping with psychological age interests? 
11. Do the activities “lead on” or are they merely “ends in themselves” ? 
The following research studies have a direct bearing upon curriculum 
construction in physical education. ‘They are arranged in chronological 
order.

derived by adding his age, grade, height, and weight. After being placed 
in a respective group he is encouraged to strive for individual proficiency 
toward a standard, arbitrarily set up for his respective group, and by means 
of averaging group scores to compete with all other groups. The grades 
included are 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B, 8A, and 8B. These are divided 
into two divisions, Juniors, 5A to 6B, and Seniors, 7A to 8B. 
Method. a. In fifteen minutes it was possible to classify a class of forty 
pupils, by adding the age, grade, height, and weight of each pupil. 
b. This determines the pupils’ classification for the ensuing year.

c. A system of handicaps was arbitrarily established based on classifica- 
tion. i 
d. Following several years of practice a system of standards for each 
event has been arranged for boys and girls. ‘These standards are not 
fixed but are changeable. The object is always to keep them practically 
within reach of all, yet high enough to serve as an incentive to the best. 
e. In all activities there is a maximum beyond which no credit is given. 
With the full program the total number of points attainable is 200. 
Findings. a. There is little difference in the distribution of height and 
weight between the sexes in the last four years of the elementary school. 
b. Mr. Reilly believes that the absolute satisfaction of the pupils after 
.many months of extensive competition is conclusive proof that the scheme 
is fundamentally correct. 
STUDY NO. 10. McCloy, C. H. “Comparison of athletic activities.” 
American Physical Education Review, Vol. XXVI, pp. 1-13, 1921. 
Purpose. To derive a statistical and mathematical method of devising 
athletic scoring tables. 
Method. By means of athletic almanacs for the last ten years, Mr. 
McCloy plotted data for all meets. The pound probability curve was 
smoothed by arithmetical means. Likewise, a standard deviation curve was 
plotted. Tables have been worked out showing the amount of kinetic 
energy used in running, jumping, etc., according to velocity. ‘Through 
algebraic expressions he determined the formula of the curve. 
Findings. Only 270 individuals out of one million fell out of the range 
of the curve.

Purpose. A comparative study of the relative value of formal gym- 
nastics and play for fourth grade pupils. 
Method. Two fourth grade classes of equal ratings were selected. One 
class received instruction in formal gymnastics and the other in a program 
of play and games. They were tested in October and again in May in 
posture, skill, alertness, and obedience. Later, statistics were obtained 
regarding weight, height, girth of chest, strength of right and left fore- 
arm, and lung capacity. A highly trained supervisor, skilled in both types 
of work, taught both classes throughout. 
Findings. The results showed that the Play Group made greater prog- 
ress in all points except the thrusting test with wooden foil, which was one 
of the tests of skill.

    314 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
Purpose. a. What are the results, in actual measurements, of the par- 
ticipation of the mentally retarded child in this type of work? 
b. How does the mentally retarded child compare with the normal child 
in track and field ability? 
Method. The records of 1524 mentally retarded boys and of 638 men- 
tally retarded girls were gathered, using the four standard events—stand- 
ing broad jump, ball throw overhead, 50 yard dash, and chinning for boys 
and knee raising for girls. The schools involved were 8 concentration 
centres, where each child receives a daily 30- or 40-minute period in the 
gymnasium. ‘he performances in each event were recorded monthly and 
the best record during the school term was used in the investigation. 
To make the comparison with normal children the records of 1210 boys 
and 814 girls were secured under conditions, as far as was possible, the 
same as those in the special concentration centres; i.e., time allotment, 
equipment, type of teacher, play space, etc. 
From the data secured three sets of tables were formed—one set based 
upon age, one upon height, and one upon weight. Results were tabulated 
on the basis of average performance and on the basis of 70 per cent passing 
performance. (The latter being the point on the distribution table which, 
if set as an aim, 70 per cent of those measured would pass.) 
Findings. As far as the data in this investigation shows, the following 
conclusions may be drawn: 
a. Mentally retarded hoys are shorter in height and lighter in weight 
than normal boys; the girls are shorter in all ages and lighter up to the age 
of 12, but are about same weight as the normal girls from 13 to 15. 
b. Mentally retarded boys jump and throw farther aod run faster than 
mentally retarded girls. 
c. Mentally retarded boys are from one and a half to three years lower 
in average performance than normal boys in the four events used ; mentally 
retarded girls are from two to seven years lower than normal girls. 
d. Ability in track and field events should be taken into consideration 
as one index of the physical age of the child. 
These findings are significant in adjusting the physical education curricu- 
lum to individual needs. 
SECTION II. RELATIONSHIP OF OTHER KINDS OF RESEARCH 
TO CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION IN THE FIELDS OF 
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
Educational researches in the fields of health and physical education are 
very limited and represent only a beginning of the studies and carefuly 
conducted experiments which are requisite for any adequate basis for the 
makers of curricula in these subjects. Many types of research must be 
carried on before the activities in these fields can be placed on a firmly 
scientific basis. There are already available, however, the results of 
research studies which, while they do not deal directly with curriculum
-P-A-G-E-315
  
Tue THirp YEARBOOK ’ sls)   
construction, nevertheless have an important bearing upon that task. ‘The 
attention of those who are making curricula in these fields is called to the 
importance of the following kinds of research: 
A. Growth studies. Studies which attempt to ascertain standards of 
normal growth and development have significantly influenced the content of 
courses of study in health and physical education by the fact that they set 
up objective standards of achievement, both for pupil and teacher. 
The ‘‘Revised Weight-Height-Age Tables” of Bird T. Baldwin, and 
Thomas D. Wood, are widely used. They were published by the American 
Child Health Association in a pamphlet issued in 1923. 
Similarly, studies which seek to discover whether there are correlations 
between physical and mental achievement, or between height-weight and 
school classification, have an indirect bearing upon curriculum making, 
especially in connection with the tendency to place pupils of the same grade 
in school in x, y, z groups according to the rapidity with which it is pre- 
sumed that they will advance in their studies. 
The replies to the inquiries of this subcommittee indicate that there is a 
relatively large amount of research being carried on in studying the relation- 
ships of physical condition and mental achievement. 
B. Laboratory research. ‘The accuracy of much of the subject matter in 
health and physical education has been or should be ascertained through 
laboratory research in physiology, physics, biochemistry, bacteriology, nutri- 
tion, etc. For example, the discoveries concerning vitamins within ten 
years have radically changed teaching regarding selection of foods. The 
investigation of the New York Commission for the Study of Ventilation 
has changed our teaching about proper heating and ventilating, and has 
thrown doubt upon some points hitherto unquestioned. 
C. Nutrition class experiments. Nutrition class experiments, usually give 
more guidance in problems of supervision and administration, coéperation 
with the home and methods of efficiently reducing malnutrition than in 
curriculum construction, but they point to certain principles in selection 
of subject matter, as illustrated in Study No. 2, reported in preceding 
pages. 
D. Health supervision studies. One of the generally accepted though 
not practiced principles in health and physical education is that the activ- 
ities of the course of study should be adapted to the needs of individual 
children as well as to the groups as a whole. The health examination is 
one of the most reliable ways of ascertaining individual needs, and health 
examination records of a class should be consulted as one source of guid- 
ance in directing classroom activities in health education. Studies made as 
to the best ways of making and recording health examinations therefore 
have an indirect bearing upon the course of study. 
E. Dental education studies. Experience with dental education over a 
period of ten years in Bridgeport, Connecticut, gives evidence that class- 
room education is an effective method in reducing the number of children 
   
-P-A-G-E-316
  316 ' DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
who have defective teeth, thus justifying the inclusion of mouth hygiene 
in the course of study. 
F. Hygiene of the school plant. Research in this field has an indirect 
bearing upon course of study activities. For example, what we teach regard- 
ing open window or open air rooms, may be either supported or contradicted 
by actual school room conditions. ‘here is still doubt regarding the best 
procedure in many instances; more research is needed here. 
G. Hygiene of instruction. Very little conclusive research exists in this 
field, but whatever study has been made, affects our procedure with regard 
to formation of healthful mental habits of work, study, social relationships, 
control of emotions in classroom, instruction, etc. “These mental habits, 
while not a part of a formal course of study are an extremely important 
factor in health education. 
Incompleted Studies, Reports of Which Are Not Yet Available 
The Subcommittee has received notices of the following studies, related 
to curriculum construction in health and physical education, which are not 
yet completed, but which will for the most part, be completed within a

SECTION III. SUMMARY 
A. General Summary of Trend of Research Findings in Health Education 
1. A survey of the local community health needs and of the health needs 
of individual children is the most valid basis for the construction of the 
curriculum in health education. The submission of a questionnaire to the 
pupils themselves, at the beginning of the year, gives information to the 
teacher which is helpful in placing the emphasis where it is most needed. 
2. It is necessary for the school, the home and the community to co- 
operate if the health education program of the school is to be effective. 
3. The tendency in health education is to measure and evaluate results 
in terms of its effectiveness in solving the actual health problems of the 
individual and the community rather than in terms of knowledge alone. 
Study No. 5 reports the construction of a scale based upon this principle 
and states that the use of such a scale “turns the attention of the teacher 
from the immediate school objectives to life practices, with great benefit 
not only on instruction in health, but other instruction as well.” 
- The acceptance of the criterion of social utility makes a profound change 
in the presentation of subject matter as well as in the measurements of 
results. 
This is not indicated in any of the research studies reported, but is very 
apparent in courses of study in which an attempt is made to limit subject 
matter to the materials which boys and girls can actually use in life. 
Several such courses of study were brought to the attention of .this com- 
mittee, but have not been indicated in this report, since they do not represent 
the results of controlled research although they are the outcome of extensive 
and scholarly work. 
4, Although the final measurement of health education values consists 
in evaluation of its usefulness in solution of health problems, it is also 
necessary to devise measures of the informational or knowledge aspects of 
the health education program. Health information tests should be made 
and tried out to give an experimental basis for placing information in suit- 
able grades. One such test has been constructed. 
5. Available research does not enable the committee to make a definite 
statement regarding standards of achievement for any grade. 
Study No. 4 indicates that achievements in health habits, skills, knowl- 
edge, and appreciations, show appreciable growth from entrance into kinder- 
garten till the time of completing the first grade. More extensive studies 
along the same line are needed before minimum standards of achievement 
can be set up. 
   
-P-A-G-E-318
  
318 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
6. The subject matter of health education should not emphasize the value 
of health as an end in itself so much as the value of health as a means to 
accomplishing interesting and worth-while things. With elementary school 
children the emphasis should be on the relationship of health to the activ- 
ities of the immediate present rather than the distant future. 
Note.—Although so little actual research is available in the field of 
health education, a considerable body of experience points to certain prin- 
ciples which are generally accepted as sound. A discussion of these prin- 
ciples falls outside the scope of this report. ‘The most recent and com- 
prehensive discussion of them is to be found in the report on “Health Edu- 
cation” of the Joint Committee on Health Problems of the National Edu- 
cation Association and American Medical Association, “‘A Program for 
Public Schools and Teacher Training Institutions,” published in June, 
1924, and available from the National Education Association headquarters 
at Washington. 
B. General Summary of Trend of Research Findings in Physical Education 
The research studies in physical education point out several definite fac- 
tors which should be carefully considered in a program of curriculum con- 
struction. ‘They are as follows: 
a. A study of age, grade, weight, and height is suggested as a satisfac- 
tory means of classifying students for physical education activities. 
b. The use of a four-point classification (age, grade, height, and weight) 
has proven a satisfactory means of grouping high school boys for inter- 
scholastic athletics. 
c. The relationship of physical efficiency may be a potent factor in ‘ad- 
justing pupils to the correct grade placement. 
d. One study points out that a child’s physical ability and development 
should be considered in classifying him as to acceleration or retardation) in 
school progress. 
e. An experiment shows that play is more effective than formal exercise 
as a means of reaching the objectives laid down in a physical education 
program. 
f. Group competition is desirable whenever possible for two chief reasons: 
1. It stimulates pupils to increase their individual achievement. 
2. It is socially effective in that the individual is urged to greater self realiza- 
tion in keeping with the best group interests. 
g. Little difference exists between height and weight between the sexes 
in the last four years of elementary school. 
h. The amount of kinetic energy used in running, jumping, etc. has been 
calculated. From data thus obtained it has been found that only 270 
individuals out of one million tested, fell out of the distribution curve. 
i. A plan has been evaluated which is physiologically sound whereby 
basketball tournaments may be conducted, limiting the physical strain of 
the contesting athletes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK : 319 
  
j. A plan has been evolved for grouping physically defective high school 
pupils into similar groups for corrective work. 
k. Underweight causes a lessening of motor efficiency, equivalent to from 
one half to one year of retardation. 
1. A study of mentally retarded pupils yielded the following interesting 
results: 
1. Mentally retarded boys are shorter in height and lighter in weight than 
normal boys. The girls are shorter in all ages and lighter up to the age of 12, 
but are about the same weight as normal girls from 13 to 15 years. 
2. Mentally retarded boys jump and throw farther and run faster than mentally 
retarded girls. 
3. Mentally retarded boys are from 1% to 3 years lower in average perform- 
ance than normal boys in the four events (standing broad jump, ball throw over- 
head, 50 yard dash and chinning for boys and knee raising for girls). Mentally 
retarded girls are from 2 to 7 years lower than normal girls.

of Public Education, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Chairman 
Major Problems in the Formation of the Curriculum in Home Economics 
What emphasis should be placed on the knowledge of textile fabrics; 
color harmonies; hygiene of clothing; relation of foods to health; and of 
the effect of cleanliness of person, dwelling, and surroundings upon health? 
To what extent should manipulative skill be stressed ? 
For what coérdination with English, arithmetic, geography, and civics, 
should the home economics curriculum provide? 
Are results most satisfactory when the home economics curriculum con- 
sists of short intensive units? 
Should projects selected in home economics be of a type that can be com- 
pleted before the interest of the pupil wanes? 
Since home economics should contribute to home helpfulness and the 
formation of health habits, to what extent should the curriculum be based 
upon home experiences? 
To what extent should curriculum modifications be encouraged in order 
that the school activities in home economics may be varied to meet the 
different social and economic needs in the different sections of the larger 
cities? 
To what extent should home projects be included in the curriculum? 
To what extent should the home economics curriculum be modified to 
meet the needs of the overaged or subnormal girl? 
What time allotment is essential to adequate instruction in home eco- 
nomics, recognizing as we must, that the curriculum is affected by the 
time set aside for such instruction ? 
RESEARCH STUDIES IN HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 
IN GRADES 1 TO 6 
STUDY NO. 1. Trilling, Mabel Barbara, Miller, Ethelwyn, and 
others. Home economics in American schools. Supplementary Educational 
Monographs. Department of Education, Univ. of Chicago, 1920. pp. 122. 
Purpose. To report the findings of a survey of the status of home 
economics in public schools of the United States, as a basis for helping to 
determine the curriculum in elementary and secondary schools. 
Method. Question blanks were sent to 300 cities including two in every 
state, to discover subjects taught in home economics and the books influenc- 
ing the curriculum. An analysis was made of these courses of study and 
of the text and reference books found to be most commonly used. A study 
was also made of the literature dealing with home economics in search of 
objectives. In addition the report gives the preliminary organization of 
[320]
-P-A-G-E-321
  
Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 321 
  
tests in measuring skill in machine sewing and content and reasoning tests 
in textiles and clothing. 
Findings. A. There is a dearth of adequate elementary school material 
evidenced by the fact that certain books written for the high school and 
college are being used as texts and reference books in the grades. Only 15 
per cent of the elementary schools are using texts; 21 per cent reference 
books. The textbooks used are stressing the acquisition of information and 
skill with little consideration given to the development of power and judg- 
ment. 
B. Emphasis in the elementary school is placed on the technical processes 
involved in food preparation and clothing construction with insufficient con- 
sideration given to other important phases of home economic work. 
C. There is little evidence of a continuous course of study in the grades 
suited to the various stages of growth of children. This is shown (a) by the 
general practice of introducing into the schools in the early grades the study 
of clothing construction, deferring the work in food for two or more years, 
(b) by the fact that courses are not arranged on the basis of increasing 
difficulty to the learner, (c) by the custom of introducing hand sewing 
into the grades previous to machine sewing. . In 14 per cent of the schools 
the teaching of machine sewing is not mentioned. 
D. The preliminary use of educational tests shows their value in helping 
to establish minimal essentials and in developing a critical attitude toward 
the curriculum. It seems safe to predict that the use of the scale for measur- 
ing machine sewing will lead to the setting of definite standards of attain- 
ment, will give the inexperienced teacher a definite guide and will be a 
means of diagnosing difficulties in machine sewing. 
STUDY NO. 2. Trilling, Mabel Barbara. 4 study of objectives in 
the teaching of textiles. ‘Thesis for Master’s degree. Unpublished, 1923, 
90 pp. University of Chicago Library. 
Purpose. The purpose of this study is to offer a contribution toward 
helping to determine the important topics that should be included in tex- 
tile courses in typical public schools. 
Method. ‘The material has been obtained from two sources: (a) Facts 
have been collected from consumers regarding the information they desire 
when purchasing textiles. The method used was to observe consumers 
when shopping and to record the questions they ask of salespersons regard- 
ing the qualities and facts they desire to know about the materials pur- 
chased. (b) Material has been obtained from an analysis of twelve of 
the textile books most commonly used in the public schools; this study 
is based on the assumption that the problems possessing sufficient value to 
be included in the school curriculum are to be found in textbooks. 
Findings. 1. The study shows that there is sufficient social need for 
textile information to warrant more time being devoted to this phase of 
home economics than is at present being given in the majority of elementary 
and secondary schools. 
   
-P-A-G-E-322
  322 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
2. The qualities demanded in fabrics by consumers when in agreement 
with the facts emphasized by experts may profitably be used to formulate 
minimal essentials for a beginning course in textiles in the pubic schools. 
Such material is: 
(1) Knowledge of fibers; kinds and properties 
(2) A study of yarns 
(3) Simple processes of cloth construction, such as spinning and weaving 
4) Finishing processes 
5) Imitations and substitutions 
6) Simple methods of dyeing 
7) Simple physical and chemical tests 
8) Study of fabrics and how to use them 
9) Hygienic aspects of clothing 
3. Those topics which recent books are showing a tendency to eliminate, 
and which have received no emphasis by consumers should be given little 
emphasis in school courses. Such material is: 
(1) Historical data 
(2) Detailed technical study of spinning, weaving, and other processes of 
construction 
(3) Too detailed study of certain finishing processes, such as bleaching and 
dyeing 
(4) Emphasis on botanical aspects of fibers 
4, There is a body of material included under the topic economics of 
clothing which has received almost no consideration from consumers of 
textiles but which has been given certain emphasis in textbooks. It is 
suggested that a study of the material be continued in textile classes, the 
emphasis given to this material to be determined through further studies. 
Certain typical problems are: Clothing budgets, pure fabric laws, standard- 
ization of styles in fabrics and garments, responsibility of consumers for 
certain labor conditions, and ethics of shopping. 
5. It is apparent that important contributions for establishing textile ob- | 
jectives are obtained from each of these studies; neither can be used as the 
sole source of material, but each should be supplemented by material of the 
other. 
STUDY NO. 3. Williams, Florence. Standards of attainments for 
ability in machine sewing. Master’s thesis. University of Chicago Li- 
brary, Chicago, Ill., 1922. 
Purpose. It is the purpose of this investigation (1) to further in a 
small degree the scientific measurement of achievement in home economics 
education; (2) to set up standards of attainment in machine sewing for 
different grades and ages. 
Method. A large number of samples of machine-made hems and 
French seams, 3117 in all, averaging 300 to the grade, were collected from 
different school systems in 11 different cities under as carefully controlled 
conditions as possible. The samples were scored on the Knapp and Wil-
-P-A-G-E-323
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 323   
liams scale. This is a scale for measuring ability in machine sewing. It 
consists of photographic reproductions of samples of machine-made hems 
and French seams. The scale is analytic in character. Five factors which 
contribute to a well made French seam or hem are judged separately, and 
the scale shows three different qualities for each factor. A reproduction of 
the scale can be found in the University of Chicago Educational Mono- 
graph Home Economics in American Schools, Mabel Trilling and others. 
Each sample was judged separately for each of the five factors. Next the 
average score for each sample was found. The samples were scored for 
standards of attainment for both different grades and different ages. 
Findings. 1. Only a small number of samples were obtained from the 
fifth grade. The average score for both the French seam and the hem was 
low. Because of the small number scored it is impossible to determine 
whether the score is significant or not. If such a low score had been ob- 
tained from a large number of samples it would indicate that fifth-grade 
children could not be expected to attain much skill in machine sewing. 
2. There is a steady rate of increase in ability shown in the average 
scores for the different grades. 
3. It is interesting to note that the increase in ability for the different 
ages is not so steady as in the standard of attainment for the different 
grades. ‘The range of scores in the different grades is almost the same for 
every grade. 
STUDY NO. 4. Winchell, Florence E. How can household arts 
teaching be made more effective? Lincoln School of Teachers Colleges, 
New York City, 1923. 24 p. 
“Results of a study made through personal interviews with nineteen 
women who formerly taught household arts in elementary and secondary 
schools and are now married and in their own homes.” 
Fourteen definite questions were asked, such as: Does it still seem to 
you that there is a logical sequence which you would always follow in 
presenting household arts subjects? What specific education for boys do 
you recommend that would make their attitude in the home better, and 
woman’s work in the home easier? Where have you felt weaknesses in 
your training, etc.? The answers were tabulated descriptively. 
The most important conclusion was that household arts teachers be 
urged to “‘give the weight of their influence to the establishment of ideals 
of simple and systematic housekeeping that may free the homemaker for 
the educational and recreational phases of her family life.” 
Other summaries were: (1) Need of early home training of both boys 
and girls; (2) food interest the most vital to family; (3) insufficient prep- 
aration among homemakers for child care; (4) interest, a child factor in 
elementary school home economics subject matter; and (5) accuracy ad- 
vantageous, but it is possible for home economics teachers to overemphasize 
precision in processes.

“A study in curriculum material; analysis for educational guidance of

vironment as it expresses itself in the consumption of food, shelter, fuel, 
and clothing.” 
‘This study compares the actual present economic habits of our nation 
with approved standards of consumption in the light of reliable standards of 
living. 
‘The studies used in collecting materials were direct surveys of habits of 
people, statistical reports, and data obtained from many sources. ‘The con- 
clusions reached were essentially those of objectives concerned with the 
acquisition of information, development of habits, and development of atti- 
tudes which give approval or disapproval of economic conditions and pro- 
posals. ‘The question is raised, Can economic habits be modified ? 
‘The definite objectives set up for the social significance of food, cloth- 
ing, shelter, etc., are of distinct value to all home economics teachers. The 
study as a whole suggests the need for home economics materials to be in 
line with actual conditions of life as they are found in American homes 
today. See review of this study on page 269 and on page 334.

‘The problem as stated was what are the trends or evolutionary tenden- 
cies in regard to home economics materials offered in the elementary cur- 
riculum (grades one to six)? It was assumed the evolutionary tendencies 
could be seen in field practices shown in printed courses of study, in re- 
ported practices, and by theories as expressed in the best thinking. 
‘The data were collected from courses of study of one hundred cities of 
varying types, superintendents’ reports, and special school programs. “The 
validity of this is being checked by previous studies and the theories of 
general educators, specialists, and reviews of selected judges. 
‘The conclusions reached are of value in three ways: (1) They are sug- 
gestive to general grade teachers; (2) they serve as basic materials for 
grade home economics tests; and (3) they afford a clarification of home 
ecnomics’ share in the elementary curriculum.

Method. At the beginning of the year the teacher has a private con- 
ference with each child during which they make a record of the child’s 
likes, dislikes, prejudices, and all available facts about his present diet. 
This is supplemented by information gained from the mothers at a group 
meeting at which the purposes and methods are explained. The course is 
planned to meet the needs as found. After the end of the course a second 
record will be taken and findings compared with the first. In order 
to check the permanency of results, records will again be obtained at the 
end of the year for comparison. 
It is planned to continue this study with similar groups for several 
years and to adapt subject matter and methods to suit the needs as re- 
vealed by the study.

educational problems. ‘Teachers College, Columbia Univ., Office ef Re- ©

An attempt to discover the “trend of the times” and to secure a working 
organization on which to base later research—the major purpose was to 
bring together a program of coéperative thinking and to take cognizance of 
the field condition. If home economics educational research is to assist 
course-of-study makers and curriculum thinkers, then studies made should 
show up facts and figures relative to the problems or in other terms, short- 
ages in the field. 
An objective study was made through interviews and reviews of pub- 
lished writings. ‘The definite question put in the interviews or considered 
in the reading was “What do you consider some of the outstanding or 
most insistent problems in public school home economics?” Not more than 
five problems were recorded from one person. “The question was asked of 
selected personnel from the following groups: (1) General educators and 
administrators, (2) home economics teachers and supervisors, (3) mothers 
and homemakers, (4) social thinking laymen, and (5) social workers. 
Three hundred and fifty problem assertions were obtained, analyzed, 
filed, and charted. Problems of curriculum materials, child learnings, and 
instruction were most frequent. The chart “showed-up” the field with its 
present ills needing diagnostic treatment. ‘The study was not considered 
finished. It should be carried on to approximately one thousand statements 
so that the frequency study could be of more value. 
Home economics in the elementary school: A professional group study. 
For more than a year the household arts group of Teachers College,

various school levels. The conclusions of this group study have been put 
into form for the elementary school as they relate to (1) purposes, (2) 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  
326 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
organization of work, (3) methods of study, (4) outcomes, (5) relation- 
ships to other subjects, as follows: 
1. Purposes of the work stated with reference to several supplementary 
bases : 
A. Purposes stated in terms of social or practical objectives 
a. The consumer purposes 
(1) Health-usage as affected by habits and by meaningful information. 
(2) Economic selection with reference to values in terms of both need 
and cost. 
(3) Art, or aesthetic selection with reference to qualities of beauty. 
b. The citizenship purposes 
(1) Social control regulations with ‘reference to conditions and practices 
which can be had only by codperation—problems of health, exploita- 
tion, economy, and art. 
(2) Social aspects of personal and family problems relative to food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter. 
c. The occupational participating purposes—home-participation by helping with: 
(1) Food—preparation and service, and care of utensils and implements 
(2) Clothing—care, laundering, and simple repair. 
(3) Housekeeping—bed-making, care of rooms, arrangement and care of 
furnishings, care of floors, walls, doors and windows. 
(4) Home upkeep—simple repairs of woodwork, furniture, doors, locks, 
windows, screens, curtain and shade rods and rollers, picture frames, 
heating plant, plumbing, lighting systems and labor-saving devices 
and implements, both indoors and outdoors. 
(5) Child care—simple kinds of care relative to the health and happiness 
of young children. 
(6) Recreation—social life of the home and entertainment of guests. 
B. Purposes stated in terms of psychological objectives 
a. The formation of good habits relative to the use of food and clothing and 
to participation in home life generally. 
b. The development of intelligence and insight relative to the production and 
usage of food, clothing and shelter materials, and of the simpler social o1 
citizenship problems connected with them. 
c. The development of critical judgment for the selection of food, clothing and 
shelter materials with reference to standards of value in health, economy, 
and art. 
d. The development of an appreciation of, or a liking for, that which is 
aesthetically of fine quality. ° . The development of that general dexterity in the manipulation of materials, 
tools, and machines connected with the upkeep of the home which should 
be common to all boys and girls of twelve years of age. 
2. Organization of the work. ‘The work should be distributed through- 
out the elementary school from the first grade on the basis of capacity in 
relationship to interests and needs. Some work in each year for each aspect 
of the whole subject of home life will contribute to the development of 
habits, intelligence, appreciations, and interests. 
3. Methods of study. Investigative activities, frequently initiated by 
manipulative or constructive work, and very generally carried forward by 
   
-P-A-G-E-327
            Tue TuHirp YEARBOOK 327   
its use, constitute the more significant elements of method. Excursions, 
readings, home participation and exhibits should all be used. The hand 
work is a means to clarify ideas, to aid in experiments, and to express orig- 
inal ideas of design or planning in concrete form. Hand work has its maxi- 
mum value for growth in both practical efficiency and character when it is 
employed in achieving some worth-while purpose. 
4. Outcomes. Outcomes for the elementary school period for each re- 
spective grade should be stated in specific detail as a means of evaluating 
the work. This is a problem not yet adequately solved. 
5. Relationships to other subjects. As the life problems included in other 
subjects largely grow out of the practical arts needs, the work in household 
arts will incorporate many elements from both biological and physical 
science, from mathematics, from design, from industrial and commercial 
geography, and from history. Many of the elements of these subjects find 
their most common applications and uses in the problems of household arts.

Summary of Findings 
That home economics is usually limited to the upper two grades—i. e., 
the fifth and sixth grades. 
That home economics instruction in elementary schools is often narrowed 
down to include sewing only, whereas all phases of home life should be rep- 
resented to the extent justified by the intelligence, interests, and abilities of 
the child of a given age or grade. 
That hand-work is over-emphasized and projects selected are not ar- 
ranged so as to insure progressive knowledge and skill. 
That ability in home economics work progresses with grade rather than 
with advance in age. 
That home economics instruction should be in line with actual condi- 
tions of life as they are found in American homes today. 
There have been few research studies in home economics in elementary 
schools. In part this is the result of a lack of interest in elementary school 
problems by those in colleges and universities directing research projects. 
So great has been the demand for high school home economics teachers and 
so small has been the supply of well-trained women that the higher insti- 
tutions of learning have interested themselves in high school problems only.
-P-A-G-E-328
  
328 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 
  
There are relatively few textbooks in home economics adapted to ele- 
mentary school work. 
Since home economics instruction must be based, to some extent, on cli- 
matic, economic, and social conditions and since these vary so greatly in the 
different sections of the United States, it has been difficult for any textbook 
writer to include material universally adaptable.

Major Problems in the Formation of the Curriculum in Industrial Arts 
How far should a course in industrial arts emphasize the cultivation of ap- 
preciation in art, in motor skill, or both? 
To what degree should a project in industrial arts be selected because of its 
life values? Because of its value to develop skill? 
Shall a separate course of study in industrial arts be set up? 
How far should a course in the common elements of industrial arts serve 
for an entire city rather than units within a city. 
To what extent shall the varying and transient interests of children dic- 
tate the content of the industrial arts course? 
‘To what extent should the selection of subject matter in industrial arts be 
determined by the needs of the consumer in after life? 
In a school of limited resources should the course of study provide for in- 
dustrial arts, music, etc., as well as the fundamentals? 
What responsibility and obligations shall the general supervisor, such as the 
assistant superintendent, principal, or primary supervisor, have in the 
organization of the course of study in industrial arts, and in determin- 
ing the content of the course? 
To what extent should home conditions serve as one basis of content in the 
the course of study in industrial arts? 
Should the subject matter for boys and girls be identical? If so, up to 
what time? Where should differentiation begin and what should be 
the nature of it? 
What attention should be given to methods of teaching in the making of a 
course of study in industrial arts? 
To what extent should standards be developed to test motor skill in indus- 
trial arts? 
Review of Research Studies in Industrial Arts 
STUDY NO. 1. Kent, Ernest B. The constructive interests of chil- 
dren. New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia 
Univ., 1903. 78 pp. 
This is probably the first attempt to obtain a really scientific basis for 
selecting constructive work for the elementary school. The purpose of the 
study was to find the natural constructive interests of children by ascertain- 
ing what kinds of constructive projects they made voluntarily outside of 
school. : 
The data were obtained by asking children to write, on a blank provided, 
answers to questions covering: Articles made voluntarily outside of school 
[329] 
   
-P-A-G-E-330
  
330 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
during the preceding twelve months; for what purpose they were made; 
and for whom they were made. Answers were obtained and used from 148 
children, 63 boys and 85 girls, of from eight to fifteen years of age, in the 
Horace Mann and Ethical Culture Schools of New York City. 
From the study of results, the objects reported were classified as to ma- 
terials used, kinds of projects as to use, and for whom made. Age and sex 
differences were noted. 
For the average boy, about half of the projects are those used in play, ana 
about three-tenths for real use—two-tenths as gifts, and one-tenth for his 
own use. For the girls, dolls and toys relating to dolls are the dominant 
motives for voluntary constructive projects, with the gift interest second. 
The study includes also the kiads of constructive activities and interests 
reported by 72 talented engineers as they remembered their years of boy- 
hood between eight and sixteen. Comparisons are made with the results ob- 
tained from the school boys. The selected group of engineers show from 
their remembered interests somewhat more constructive activity in me- 
chanical projects than the school boys. 
In this brief note, mention can not be made of the numerous interesting 
points and the suggestive. questions raised by the study. The number ot 
children was too small and the limitations of environment too great to 
permit of generalizations from the investigation. But it is of interest as a 
pioneer study, using a method which, with the refinements since developed, 
may be, and is, profitably employed today. The author recognizes fully 
that voluntary interests, as expressed outside of school are but one factor 
in determining kinds of industrial arts work. ‘They do represent one factor 
and an important one—how important, the study does not reveal. 
STUDY NO. 2. Edgerton, Alonson H. Industrial arts in our ele- 
mentary schools. Peoria, Il., The Manual Arts Press, 1922. 31 pp. 
This study reviews the industrial arts work in 141 city public school 
systems, distributed among nineteen states, in 1920-1921. The material 
is presented in three parts, treating respectively of: (1) The purposes and 
content of industrial arts; (2) the relationships of industrial arts to other 
subjects; and (3) methods of presenting industrial arts units of study. 
The Purposes and Content of Industrial Arts 
‘The chief reasons reported for offering industrial arts instruction in the 
first six grades were as follows: 
1. To give a basis for judgment in the selection and use of industrial products 
and service. (This reason was given by 51 cities.) 
2. To develop an appreciation for the economic and social phases of industry. 
(This reason was given by 39 cities.) 
3. To offer sufficient experience in industrial processes to meet the pupil’s needs 
and to illustrate the industry. (This reason was given by 32 cities.) 
4. To vitalize geography, history, arithmetic, oral and written expression, and 
other subjects of the curriculum. (This reason was given by 19 cities.)
-P-A-G-E-331
  
Tue THirp YEARBOOK 331   
“Although it was discovered that a few of these claims were expressions 
of future plans rather than the present status and conduct of the work, 
nevertheless, only about six per cent of these public school systems have 
made practically no change in the methods of organizing and conducting 
their elementary industrial work during the past few years 
Over eighty per cent . . . . show every evidence of having under! 
ee desirable reorganization in methods and procedure.” 
‘The newer organization tends to abandon the separate lines of work un- 
der the terms, manual training, domestic science, domestic art, and some 
phases of drawing and design, and to combine all studies of processes and 
values of materials under the one term, industrial arts, for the first six 
grades. Defining the subject as “the study of the changes made by man in 
materials to increase their values for usage,” the emphasis is changed from 
that of mere manipulation of materials and tools to a study of values for 
the selection and use of products, using hand work as a means and not alone 
as an end in itself. The work centers about the needs of everyday life in 
selecting and using the products of the industries with reference to health, 
ecnomy, art, and social values, leaving training in productive skills to vo- 
cational education. Much hand work is used in developing these values 
and in promoting the growth of general dexterity. Comparative data for 
the 141 school systems offering instruction in each type of work, indicate 
that the greatest emphasis is upon studies of: (1)Shelter and furniture, (2) 
textiles and clothing, and (3) foods and allied activities/f Only five and 
eight-tenths per cent of the 141 cities give hand work, as such. One de- 
scriptive type study of an industrial arts unit for each of the six grades is 
given to illustrate the meaning of the study as organized to represent edu- 
cational values. ; 
The Relationship of Industrial Arts to Other Subjects 
The intimate relationships of industrial arts to other subjects are dis- 
cussed in the report, and illustrations of their profitable use are included. 
‘There is found, however, great variation in practice—from practically no 
use of relationships to very extended use of them. ‘The study includes a 
report of the methods used by 352 grade and special teachers to utilize the 
‘relationships of industrial arts work and English. Eleven descriptive ac- 
counts of typically good units of work showing profitable correlation are 
given. The values in saving time, simplifying instruction, and enriching 
experience as shown by these examples are briefly summarized and discussed. 
Methods of Presenting Units of Study for Industrial Arts 
The merits of the project method as against the assignment of a fixed 
series of exercises are summarized from the reports of teachers. Of the 141 
school systems, approximately 91 per cent of the special and grade teachers 
reporting favored the use of the project method in presenting industrial 
arts work. Perhaps there is no other subject in which the use of the project  
-P-A-G-E-332
soz, DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
method seems so immediately natural. Twelve illustrative projects in 
industrial arts are included from among reports by teachers. 
About 41 per cent of the schools reporting offer all work in common for 
boys and girls through the first six grades; about 29 per cent offer separate 
courses in the sixth grade; and about 22 per cent begin differentiating the 
work for boys and girls in the fifth grade. Only seven per cent make any 
differentiation for boys and girls below the fifth grade. 
In a brief summary, it is stated that, “Over two-thirds of the special 
teachers and supervisors questioned agree with a large number of classroom 
teachers that, in general, the attendant skill and the related information 
acquired through the elementary school period are to be justified mainly by 
resulting growth in thinking power and industria! intelligence.” ‘They are 
convinced that the work “will help pupils to establish those habits and atti- 
tudes that contribute most to their daily conduct as intelligent consumers 
and citizens.” 
‘The report is compactly organized, and, with its 29 illustrative units of 
industrial arts work reported from the practice of teachers in various 
grades, it is suggestive to both curriculum makers and teachers.

Industrial Arts in Forty-nine Cities Compared with Seattle 
In the Research Bulletin, it is shown that the total average time allot- 
ment for the first six grades for industrial arts in minutes per week is 214 
for the 49 cities; for Seattle, 258. The average time allotments by grades 
in the cities from the 49, offering industrial arts are as follows:

Minutes per week__ 60 60 60 6/2 7/0" oil

It is evident about twice as many cities include industrial arts work in 
their fifth and sixth grades as in the first and second. 
Manual Arts in Sixty Cities 
‘The tables in the Research Bulletin show that 38 of the 60 cities allot 
definite time to manual arts. Averaging this on the basis of the 60 cities, 
it is shown that 126 minutes per week are given to manual arts. This is 
one and four-tenths per cent of the total allotted time in minutes per week 
for the elementary schools. The wide variation will be apparent in the fact 
that the lowest per cent of time allotted to manual arts in any city is four- 
tenths of one per cent, and that the highest per cent is five and five-tenths.  
-P-A-G-E-333
  
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 333   
As only 38 of the cities report time allotments, it would appear that in 22 
of the 60 there is no work in manual arts offered. However, differences in 
terminology make inferences unsafe. Reference to this is made later. 
Distribution of Grades in Which Industrial Arts is Taught in 375 Cities 
‘Tables of grade distributions contain no work on “‘industrial arts,” but 
they do include “sewing,” “cooking,” and “wood work.” 
Wee Sewing. Of 205 cities reporting sewing, 121 offer work in some of the 
first six grades, distributed as follows: 
In grades one to six, 2 cities 
In grades three to five, 1 city 
In grades three to six, 7 cities 
In grades four to five, 1 city 
In grades four to six, 21 cities 
In grades five to six, 31 cities 
In grade six, : 58 cities 
Cooking. Of 218 cities reporting cooking, 62 offer work in some of the 
first six grades, distributed as follows: 
In grades three to six, 2 cities 
In grades four to six, 1 city 
In grades five to six, 19 cities 
In grade six, 40 cities b ated 
Wood Work. Of 231 cities reporting wood work, 136 offer work in 
some of the first six grades, distributed as follows: 
In grades three to four, 1 city 
In grades three to six, 1 city 
In grades four to six, 11 cities 
In grades five to six, 45 cities 
In grade six, 78 cities 
Since “drawing” is a term known to cover all work with materials in the 
lower grades in some cities, and since the number reporting drawing is so 
large for all grades, the distribution of grades in which drawing is taught is 
included. 
Drawing. Of 312 cities reporting drawing, 309 offer work in some of 
the six grades, distributed as follows: 
In grades one to four, 1 city 
In grades one to five, 3 cities 
In grades one to six, 293 cities 
In grades two to six, 10 cities 
In grades three to six, 2 cities 
In these studies, the most striking thing is the lack of apparent standards 
of time allotment or grade placement. Inference is almost forced upon one 
that variability in content is as great as in time allotment and gradation. 
The very terminology is so confusing that little can be derived from the 
reports relating to industrial arts other than a sense of need for bringing 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  334 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
order out of the chaos. In the study of Seattle and the 49 other cities, the 
term “industrial arts” is used and “drawing” is given a separate place; in 
the study of the 60 cities, ‘manual arts” is used and “art education” re- 
ceives separate treatment; and in the grade distribution study of 375 cities 
we have neither “industrial arts” or “manual arts,” but ‘‘sewing,” ‘“‘cook- 
ing,” “wood work,” and “drawing.” Other terms not included in these re- 
ports for work about the same as that indicated by the terms in these re- 
ports are “hand work,” “drawing and design,” “fine arts,” “applied arts” 
and some others used by some city school systems. ‘That there is overlap- 
ping or duplication of work under these several terms cannot be known 
from the data presented, but that there is great variability is evident from 
an examination of the details of courses of study. 
In all the studies, comparisons of time allotments and grade placements 
of the art subjects, by whatever name indicated, and the three R’s offer 
suggestions for thought about educational content and values, time expendi- 
tures, results obtained, and results possible. 
In addition to the really secondary questions of time allotment and grade 
placement, the studies suggest strongly the need for the education of cur- 
riculum makers and teachers in the fundamental character of the indus- 
trial arts field as developed in its most highly educative form in recent years. 
The possibilities of integration of vitally related parts of the curriculum, 
hitherto formally separated, should be scientifically studied to find whether 
it may not result in great economy of both time and effort. These studies 
are very stimulating in revealing the need for bringing order out of the 
chaos that exists relative to the industrial arts. 
STUDY NO. 4. Harap, Henry. Education of the consumer: A study 
in curriculum material. New York, Macmillan, 1924. 360 p. 
This study is an attempt to ascertain the objectives of American economic 
life with special reference to the consumption of food, shelter, fuel, and 
clothing. The major portion consists of evidence of the present economic 
habits of the people of the United States and an evaluation of these habits 
in the light of reliable standards of living. 
The study “is partial to no special theory of education.” It is an endeavor 
to present the facts as they are in order that curriculum makers may have 
an unbiased and reliable source upon which to base selections of materials. 
‘The adaptation to any age, grade, or level of experience may be made as the 
particular school may require. 
Objectives for each particular field are specifically stated—that is, what 
one should know and be able to do with reference to food, shelter, fuel, and 
clothing. The numerous government studies and studies of special com- 
missions on standards of living have been carefully analyzed and the find- 
ings stated. All available scientific and statistical studies of production, 
total consumption, and per capita consumption are summarized and com- 
parisons are made with such standards of what is desirable as we now have. 
Costs, methods of purchase, and problems of preservation and conservation 
 
-P-A-G-E-335

are included. Much material of. very high value that has hitherto been in- 
accessible because of its technical form of presentation, or because of its 
fragmentary distribution, has been made easily available. An extended 
bibliography makes possible references to the original sources of data. 
This book is an especially useful reference for material in those phases 
of industrial arts for the elementary school relating to food, shelter, and 
clothing. See review of this study on page 324. 
The Trend in Industrial Arts 
As is evidenced by the number of studies included, little work has yet 
been done in industrial arts which can qualify as “scientific research.” 
Studies have been of a practical type, dealing with the formulation of pur- 
poses, selecting materials to make courses harmonize with the purposes, and 
organizing the material selected into usable form for teachers. Little has 
been attempted by way of evaluation through scientific testing. 
But much has been done in establishing a new point of view and in de- 
veloping a content of materials and procedure for teachers. ‘The recent 
books and courses of study in industrial arts show changes under way which 
statements of mere presence or absence of the subject in the curriculum, or 
of time allotments, could not do. 
Where changes are evident, they are in the direction of including studies 
that relate to the use of industrial products with reference to health, eco- 
nomic, art, and social values along with manipulative or constructive work 
with materials. The subject is tending more and more to become a study 
of the industries including hand work as a means instead of a course in mere 
hand work as such. It is becoming a subject with a content of thought and 
experience. 
The relationships of the work to other subjects is also receiving greater 
attention, particularly the relationships to fine arts, to industrial and com- 
mercial geography and history, and to arithmetic. The increasing use of 
the project method is leading to greater attention to the study of the interests 
and activities relating to food, clothing, shelter, and other material supplies 
with which children are in direct contact. 
Among the courses of study in industrial arts published within the last 
five years which illustrate well these tendencies are those of Atlanta, Geor- 
gia; Baltimore, Maryland ; Los Angeles, California; Okmulgee, Oklahoma; 
Passaic, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and St. Cloud, Minnesota. 
Denver, Colorado, also has such a course in preparation. ‘These courses of 
study are quite unlike the older courses in “manual training” or “hand 
work” in that they contain a large body of thought content relating to the 
everyday needs of life for the use of industrial products. Even more hand 
work than formerly is provided, but its purpose is in relationship to definite 
values which it may contribute. 
Among the books on industrial arts for the first six grades which offer 
work on this basis and show this trend are:

primary grades. San Francisco, Harr Wagner, 1924. 
Books recently published in geography and history for the elementary 
school include much more material than formerly relating to industry. 
Sources of material for the study of the industries are becoming increasingly 
available. In fine arts, more attention than in former years is given to the 
study of products used in daily life from the standpoint of beauty in rela- 
tionship to utility, making for improved taste in selection and use. To 
such an extent is this vital relationship appreciated that in some curricula 
fine and industrial arts are combined into one study. 
Summary. Standing out most prominently then, two tendencies seem 
evident in courses in industrial arts: (1) An increasing emphasis upon con- 
tent relating to health, economic, and art values in the use of the material 
supplies and equipment of life; and (2) a recognition and use of the parts 
of industrial arts and other subjects closely related, making for economy of 
time and effort in the teaching of all of these related subjects.

ART EDUCATION 
Leon L. Winslow, Director of Art, Department of Education 
Baltimore, Maryland, Chairman 
HE IDEAL elementary school course of study is, perhaps, one in 
which the entire curriculum is administered on a plan of perfect 
articulation of the various subjects. In such a course, the inspira- 
tion for handwork is adequately furnished by the other school subjects. The 
mission of the subject of art in such a scheme would be quite largely the 
providing of illustrative and creative handwork. There is no race, no 
political division, no literature, no history, no science which is not intimately 
associated with the topics about which such an elementary art course is 
organized. In the elementary grades, at least, art as a subject is at the 
disposal of all other subjects. 
The importance of the work of the elementary school in the scheme of 
art education is sometimes underestimated. If the secondary school courses 
in art are to function as they should, it is essential that a foundation be laid 
in the elementary schools. A subject designed to meet the aesthetic needs 
of the elementary curriculum has already earned a place on many school 
programs. This subject attempts to combine drawing and construction and 
to substantiate and reinforce this drawing and construction by a content 
closely related to the industries. 
Plans for elementary art education consequently include elements from 
the fields of manual training and fine arts, so-called, and they aim to pro- 
vide content and experience which shall be of the maximum educational 
worth. The strength of the best programs consists largely in their adherence 
to the belief that all work in drawing and construction should contribute 
to the pupil’s personal and social efficiency at the time when the instruction 
is given. 
Since the teaching of art in the schools cannot cover effectively the whole 
field of art but must concentrate on problems of immediate value to the 
pupils, it follows that such teaching must function largely through the 
projects that the pupils undertake. An art project consists of a lesson or a 
complete series of lessons which has taken into account the necessary thought 
content, handwork, or appreciation, or all three, to the end that the general 
development of the pupil is assured. Expression should be the result of a 
definite purpose calling for it. ‘The selection of problems and of activities 
should always be made on the basis of the general educational values as 
opposed to the restricted training values. 
A proper use of the project method presupposes training on the teacher’s 
part, and it often includes such things as problems, investigations, assign- 
ments, reference reading, lesson plans, and textbooks. If other subjects are 
worthy of systematic organization and of sustained intellectual effort on 
the teacher’s and the pupil’s part, the subject of art is also worthy of them.

The project method of instruction has been accepted by most of the teachers 
of art in elementary schools as the inevitable method to be followed. Art 
as a school subject, therefore, includes not only drawing and art apprecia- 
tion but also design, color, lettering, and construction, as well as a clearly 
defined background of elementary science and economics which makes the 
work more valuable from the general educational side. 
Most of the existing studies in educational measurements dealing with 
art apply more specifically to drawing, which probably bears somewhat the 
same relationship to art that penmanship, or writing, bears to literature. 
The term drawing is certainly not comprehensive enough to include today 
all that is included in the field of art education. The most valuable studies 
investigated by the committee were co...equently not those concerned with 
drawing only but those that were concerned with-constructive problems in 
art education which have been developed more recently by a number of 
leaders in the field of art teaching. 
There is apparently a concensus of opinion among school administrators 
and directors of art that the purpose of art instruction in the schools is the 
development of aesthetic appreciation, which implies taste, and the power 
to produce beautiful things, which implies skill. It is also generally agreed 
that courses in art may be included in curricula as a part of general educa- 
tion or as a part of special training. In general education, the courses con- 
’ tribute primarily to the pupil’s all-round ability to conduct himself as a user 
of art products; in special training, they contribute to his ability to conduct 
himself as a producer of artistic products. The elementary school is con- 
cerned with appreciation as an aim. 
The mission of the elementary school teacher of art, be he a grade teacher 
or a specialist, is, therefore, an extremely important one, for all people today 
are users of art. They are called upon to employ art principles in the selec- 
tion of clothing, in the furnishing of homes, in business, in professions, and 
in all walks of life. But aside from the more practical necessities which 
call for instruction in art, there are also the needs for appreciation and for 
enjoyment of leisure. 
Greater educational returns have been realized where elementary school 
art is taught as a general subject by the regular grade teacher and where 
’ there has been special supervision, constructive, suggestive, and codperative 
in character. Under such administration, art has not failed to become an 
important and integral part of the curriculum. The success of art teaching 
in the future will doubtless be dependent on the successful solving of such 
problems as those raised by the subcommittee. These are given below, 
followed by a more detailed presentation of the problems from the stand- 
point of the child, the subject matter, the other subjects in the curriculum, 
and the teacher and supervisor.

Studies in Drawing and Art Appreciation 
The psychological studies that have been made contribute little of value 
to the curriculum maker in respect to elementary school art. Several studies 
do throw some light, however, on drawing and art expression from the 
standpoint of the child, while all of the more serious studies demonstrate 
the adaptability of art instruction to further scientific investigation which 
should eventually bear results from which the art teacher will be able to 
formulate guiding principles of practice for which there is at the present 
time great need. 
STUDY NO. r. Lukens, H. T. “A study of children’s drawing.” 
The Pedagogical Seminary, October, 1896. 
In 1896, Lukens carried out a study of children’s drawings in which the 
child’s mental attitude toward pictures and drawings were carefully investi- 
gated. Over 3000 drawings by children were studied. 
Findings. Although no final conclusions were reached, it was found 
that: 
1. Very young children’s drawings of people are automatic, aimless scribbles. 
By degrees, the aimless tangle of lines is reduced to a few bold telling lines. This 
seems to correspond to a clarification of the mental image in the child’s mind by a 
gradually greater discrimination on his part between the motor elements, resulting 
outwardly in mere scribble, and the strictly visual elements, producing lines 
definitely suggestive of form. 
2. Young children draw “out of their own heads” and not “from the object.” This 
is shown by the test made by having people pose as models for the children. No 
matter how the models sat, the child always drew full-face views. A review of 
drawings also showed that children of ten draw sounds and other invisible things 
such as the mind. Secondly, the little child draws from his own consciousness, and 
he puts his own consciousness into the pictures. A large proportion of the human 
figures drawn by children have childish features. 
3. Pictures properly chosen will develop the natural desire “to know what the 
picture says” or, as the children often express it “to read the picture,’ and 
this seems to be one of the natural, wholesome, and properly stimulating ways of 
beginning reading. 
4. Drawing can be used to supplement language in tests of the contents of chil- 
dren’s minds. 
5. When drawing to please themselves, children draw objects that they love, 
and at first mostly as a substitute for those objects when absent. A tabulation of 
the subjects of 1232 spontaneous drawings of children under ten years show: 
human beings, 76 per cent; stories, 12 per cent; animals, 7 per cent; plants, 3 per 
cent; and geometrical figures, ornament and scribble combined, 2 per cent. Chil-
-P-A-G-E-341
  
Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 341 
  
dren’s drawings show slight traces of any interest in mere decoration before eleven 
years of age. 
6. Little children are much more apt to express themselves through drawings 
than are adolescents. This is probably due to wrong methods of teaching drawing 
in which excellence of technique is demanded. 
7. Strong, striking, colors; red, blue, and yellow, and sharp contrasts in com- 
binations are favorites with children, and the softer tints and more harmonious 
combinations are later effects that have to be learned. The early period of loud 
colors and gaudy ornament cannot be skipped, if the development is to be natural 
and healthy. Artistic appreciation of color is a matter of slow growth. 
STUDY NO. 2. Sargent, Walter, and Miller, Elizabeth E. How chil- 
dren learn to draw. Boston, Ginn and Co., 1916. 
Sargent and Miller, through a series of experimental lessons in which 
opportunity was given children to draw freely, found in 1916 that interest 
in “telling something” often furnishes a motive sufficient to inspire good 
drawing. They also definitely determined that industrious drawing directly 
from objects unaided by other sorts of study and practice has not proved to 
be the most effective way of learning to represent objects. Children be- 
tween the ages of seven and fifteen learn to draw, if at all, largely by aid 
of memories of the way others have drawn the things they themselves are 
attempting to represent. For this reason, a collection of pictorial reference 
material is a necessary part of the equipment in drawing. ‘The description 
by another person sends one back to nature with a new capacity for analysis 
and appreciation. It was also found that progress in ability is not general 
but specific. Increase in ability to draw means increase in ability to draw 
those particular things upon which one has been practicing. 
STUDY NO. 3. Thorndike, Edward L. ‘The measurement of achieve- 
ment in drawing.” Teachers College Record, Columbia Univ., November, 
1913. 
The pioneer effort to measure a person’s ability in drawing was made by 
‘Thorndike in 1913 when he constructed a scale which attempted to meas- 
ure the child’s achievement. ‘To do this an objective scale for drawing, the 
use of which is reasonably free from subjective judgment factors, was con- 
structed. Rankings of 45 drawings by 376 competent judges were secured ; 
and a scale formed from 14 selected specimens ranging by more or less 
unequal units from zero to 17 in merit. Later this original scale was 
extended and revised by securing the ratings of 4000 drawings by five to 
15 judgments, together with the ratings of 303 selected drawings by 75 to 
100 judgments. The revised scale was formed from 70 specimens ranging 
from zero to 17 in merit. In 1922, Kline and Carey devised a more 
elaborate scale which they revised in 1923.

to construct a scale which would measure drawing achievement of pupils in

the elementary grades. Sample drawings, 5214, were collected under 
standard conditions upon four themes; house, rabbit, figure in action, tree, 
from the kindergarten and twelve grades of the public school. All samples 
were drawn by the pupils from memory. The first edition was scaled by 
92 judges, and the steps between the samples in the scale were determined 
by the statistical methods now applied to educational problems. The revised 
edition No. 5a, was scaled by 152 judges, the same themes being used as in 
the original edition. The judges were teachers and supervisors of art as 
well as professional artists. "The larger number of judges gives stability 
to the position assigned to the samples in the scale and a high degree of 
reliability. 
Directions for using the scale are given to both pupils and teachers. Those 
for the pupils are as follows: Move your drawing along the scale folder 
until a sample is found that appears to match it. Read the description (a 
critical description is printed under each sample) given below the scale 
sample, and notice if it describes your own drawing as well. If the descrip- 
tion does not apply so well to your own drawing, read that of thé sample 
next below in the scale and compare your drawing with this sample. Now, 
if your drawing matches the sample and fits the description, write on your 
drawing the number in the scale. But if the second sample and its descrip- 
tion is not so good as the first, move your drawing to the sample that is 
just above the first that you used and make a similar comparison. If this 
is more satisfactory than either of the other two, write on your drawing the 
number of the scale drawing. ‘This number is the score of your drawing. 
Again, should: your drawing have some features that match one sample and 
other features that match an adjacent sample give to your drawing a score 
equal to the average of the two adjacent scale values. 
Part II of the Kline-Carey scale, now ready for publication, is a scale in 
Design and Composition, based upon some 40,000 drawings collected under 
standard conditions from nearly all parts of the United States and scaled 
by 54 judges, the greater number of whom are supervisors of drawing. 
‘The themes comprise illustrations, designs, posters, and borders.

Royal Avenue, Baltimore, Md., William and Wilkins, 1924. 
McCarty and the Child Study Committee of the International Kinder- 
garten Union in 1923 made a study of interests and abilities as expressed in 
the drawings of children. ‘Their book is the report of an investigation of 
the drawings of children of the kindergarten, first and second grades, and 
of the years four to eight inclusive. 
Purpose. The objectives included: (1) A study of children’s interests 
as indicated by the subjects selected for drawing; (2) thé construction of a 
series of scales especially designed for the measurement of abilities in the 
early stages of education; (3) the application of the scales as a means of 
arriving at a number of psychological and educational inferences; and (4) 
an investigation of the trend of development of certain aspects. of technique.
-P-A-G-E-343
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 343   
Method. The Committee based its report on the examination of over 
31,000 free drawings of school children of the ages and grades included 
which were assembled from representative cities of all parts of the United 
States. These were first examined to discover the subjects drawn, which 
showed a range of about 1000 different ideas, a complete list of which is 
presented showing ages and sexes. ‘The ideas were then classified into a few 
generic groups, from which general trends of interest might be inferred. 
Human beings led, having been represented by sixteen per cent of all the 
children. Then follow, in this order, houses, trees, furniture, vehicles, 
parts of houses, animals, toys, flowers, etc. 
Findings. It was found that the general tendency of selection changed 
with age, especially by a notable increase in nature scenes and objects and 
an equally notable decrease in drawings of human beings. While sex differ- 
ences were not great, they appeared with some constancy. ‘The boys had a 
higher percentage of portrayals of historical events, adult social relations, 
and mechanical concepts. The girls had a higher percentage of portrayals 
of child activities, domestic life, and the more esthetic aspects of nature. 
‘Three scales were constructed, the subjects of which were human beings, 
houses, and compositions including trees. ‘The scales were then used in 
evaluating all the available drawings which were comparable to them. 
Tentative forms were established for the several ages and grades. It was 
found that, while average ability increases with age, there are, as in other 
abilities, such overlappings that numbers of four year olds reach or exceed 
the median for eight year children. In general, the ability to draw increased 
also with psychological age: the six year old children in first grade made a 
higher average score than those in kindergarten, etc. 
Comparison of the several cities represented showed that school training 
is responsible for much of the difference in drawing achievement. The per 
cent of children reaching or exceeding the median for all children varied 
from 27-8 in one city to 85-6 in another, and these differences are fairly 
constant for the three subjects of the scales and for the three school grades 
represented. 
A correlation of drawing with general intelligence was computed by a 
comparison of the drawing scores of 1420 children with their intelligence 
quotients by the Stanford-Binet tests. The correlation varied considerably 
with age, but the coefficient for the group as a whole was .35. It was found 
that correlation was closer at the lower end of the scale, indicating that 
some factors of general intelligence are indispensable to drawing. 
The study of technique generally corroborated the findings of previous 
investigators. Profile drawings were rare with younger children, the per 
cent increasing from one and four tenths at four years to 32.4 at eight 
years. The assumption that a mixed type, partly full face, partly profile, 
is commonly transitional was not confirmed, as only about five per cent of 
the children employed this form at any age. Outline drawing gradually . 
gave place to mass drawing, the proportion at four years being 73.9 to 25.6  
-P-A-G-E-344
  344 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
per cent, at eight years 34.5 to 67.9 per cent. In proportion in the relative 
size of objects, there is evidence of development from two and nine tenths 
per cent at four years to 26.7 per cent at seven years, with a marked decline 
at eight years. In balance, or symmetry or arrangement, there appears to 
be little interest during these years. Perspective is also slightly in evidence 
with no instances at four years and only one and four tenths per cent at 
seven years. The mental retardation of the eight year children in the lower 
primary grades is indicated by the fairly consistent decline in the scores for 
this year in the employment of balance, proportion, and perspective, and 
for the 8-6 group in the rating by the scales. Significant sex differences are 
noted in the greater number of boys employing profile, proportion, and 
perspective, and of girls employing balanced arrangement. 
Findings. The McCarty study closes with a statement of certain educa- 
tional inferences from the investigation—notably, the necessity of recogniz- 
ing individual differences in drawing ability, as fundamental to effective 
teaching and the equally significant necessity of recognizing that the de- 
velopment of ability to draw is susceptible to training, is dependent upon 
factors of enriched experience on one hand, and upon direct stimulation, 
with judicious guidance toward technique, on the other. 
STUDY NO. 6. Williams, Florence. ‘An investigation of children’s 
preferences for pictures.” Elementary School Journal, October, 1924. 
An interesting experiment to ascertain the preferences of children for 
pictures was made in 1924 by Williams which points the way toward a 
somewhat different kind of study which aims to determine the types of 
pictures that children like best. The report of Miss Williams’ study is the 
account of an experiment made in the Public Art Gallery of Richmond, 
Indiana. It is not assumed by the author of this study that sufficient data 
were collected to form the basis of reliable conclusions as to the types of 
pictures which children prefer. 
The collection of portraits on exhibit included thirty-two oil paintings, 
twenty-eight colored prints, and a number of miniatures, tintypes, and 
daguerreotypes. Classes of fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade children 
were brought to the gallery to see the exhibit, making a total of 939 chil- 
dren. ‘The children were asked to look at all of the portraits carefully and 
pick out the ones they liked best. This was to be done without communica- 
tion on the part of the children in order to prevent one or two strong- 
minded members of the class from influencing the vote. Each child handed 
to the teacher a slip of paper on which he had written the catalog number 
of the pictures he liked best. ‘The group of miniatures, tintypes, and 
daguerreotypes were each given one catalog number. 
A second exhibition of paintings by Richmond artists included seventy- 
four oil paintings, water colors, and pastels. Most of the artists were 
known personally or by reputation to many of the children. However, 
each artist exhibited more than one picture and many of the pictures were 
not legibly signed. Therefore, it is safe to assume that each child made a
-P-A-G-E-345
Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 345 
  
selection independent, to some extent, of his liking for a particular artist. 
Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade children visited this exhibit and 
tollowed the same procedure as was described for the exhibition of portraits. 
A third exhibition of paintings by Indiana artists consisted of one hun- 
dred oil paintings, water colors, and wood-block prints. One thousand and 
ninety-two children visited the exhibit and voted for their favorite picture. 
When the children visited this exhibition, the pupils in some of the classes 
were not asked to select the picture which they liked best until after a 
lesson was given in which the teacher tried to emphasize the merits of 
certain pictures. Pictures numbered 15 and 98 were discussed ; yet each of 
these pictures received less than fifteen votes. Evidently, the instruction 
had little to do with the choice of pictures. In every class, there was a 
large vote for ““Mussell Rocks,” which was not mentioned in any of the 
lessons. 
Findings. Miss Williams found that there is a marked tendency for the 
majority of children to like the same pictures. Most children show a 
tendency to choose pictures which are examples of good painting. Chil- 
dren like pictures of people, places, or incidents with which they are familiar. 
Children show some interest in pictures of children. It has always 
been assumed that children like pictures of other children, but this fact has 
probably been exaggerated. In the portrait exhibit, the picture which 
received the highest percentage of votes was not a picture of a child. Pictures 
of things unfamiliar to the children, but about which they have read and 
heard are popular. Pictures which tell a story appeal to children to some 
extent. This is a fact which art teachers have always assumed to be true. 
However, it may not be so great a factor in awakening appreciation for 
pictures as has been supposed. Children like pictures in which there are a 
few large, easily distinguished objects in the foreground. Instruction 
influences only to a small extent a person’s liking for certain pictures. A 
study of the technique and composition or facts about the artist apparently 
contribute little to the enjoyment of the picture. 
STUDY NO. 7. Manuel, Herschel Thurman. Talent in drawing. 
School and Home Education Monographs, No. 3. Bloomington, IIL, 
Public School Publishing Co., 1919. 
In 1919, Manuel made a study of talent in drawing which contains 
much of value to the art teacher who would direct the inclination and 
capacity of pupils toward graphic artistic expression. The objects of this 
study were to discover what are the essential characteristics of persons 
talented in drawing and to determine how the test method may be used in 
the diagnosis of talent. A number of individuals were selected for their 
recognized talent in drawing. ‘To these persons mental and physical tests 
were applied, and other information of a non-experimental character, par- 
ticularly bibliographical, was gathered from different sources. 
Findings. The investigation revealed great individual differences in the
-P-A-G-E-346
  346 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
mental and physical characteristics of persons who are talented in drawing. 
These were some of the findings: 
1. A certain elementary ability in graphic representation, such as is required for 
success with elementary school drawing, is independent, or partially independent, 
of general intelligence. 
2. General intelligence conditions the ability of drawers: (a) To acquire the 
advanced technique into which conceptual factors enter; and (b) to create original 
drawings of merit. 
3. The motor ability which underlies talent for drawing is specific rather than 
general; talent for drawing does not presuppose a general motor superiority. 
4. Achievement in handwriting and ability in drawing are relatively inde- 
pendent of each other. 
5. The ability to discriminate fine differences in visual magnitudes varies in 
persons talented in drawing. 
6. Tests of memory for visual forms have value in determining the character- 
istics of one’s drawing ability; but one may have a certain ability in graphic 
representation without a good memory for visual forms, other than the immediate 
memory required in looking from the object to the drawing surface. 
7. Quality of performance in graphic representation and quality of performance 
in esthetic judgment are independent, or at least partially independent variables. 
8. Interest may indicate either a superior innate ability or merely a high develop- 
ment of a rather ordinary endowment; but it is of immense practical importance 
as an index of the energy which one is willing to expend in the development of 
one’s ability and in practical achievement. 
9. There is no one psychological constitution for talent in drawing; the essential 
characteristics vary with the type of talent possessed. 
Manuel also found that the following characteristics, each an independent 
or partially independent variable, seem closely related to ability in drawing: 
1. The ability mentally to note a visual form, and by certain lines and areas, 
to reproduce it or significant features of it 
. Ability to observe 
. Ability to select from a complex visual situation the most beautiful aspects 
. Memory of visual forms 
. Ability mentally to manipulate visual forms 
. Ability to control hand movements in accordance with visual percept or 
image 
7. Ability to invent or to bring together into new artistic combinations the 
elements of different visual experience 
8. Ability to judge the beautiful in line, form, color, and composition 
9. Ability to discriminate differences in color 
10. Ability te discriminate differences in visual meratade 
11. Acuity of vision 
12. Interest in the act and products of drawing 
13. General intelligence Anon 
The test method and diagnosis of drawing talent are summarized by 
Manuel as follows: 
1. A diagnosis of talent in drawing must be based upon an analysis of the 
talent and a measurement of the constituent psychophysical factors. 
2. The following program of tests is recommended for the diagnosis of 
talent in drawing:

STUDY NO. 8. Gibson, Katherine. An experiment in measuring the 
results of fifth-grade class visits to an art museum. Cleveland, Ohio, Un- 
published Study in Files of Educational Department of Cleveland Museum 
of Art, 1924. 
Last year, Miss Katherine Gibson carried on an interesting experiment 
in measuring the results of the visits of fifth-grade classes to the Art Museum 
in Cleveland, Ohio. 
Purpose. The problem was to find, if possible, the effect of art lessons 
on three different groups of children: “X” classes, those made up of the 
‘most ‘intelligent, as measured by standard tests; ““Y” classes, those of aver- 
age intelligence; and “‘Z”’ classes, those of least intelligence. 
Questions were made out in mimeographed form on seven lessons given 
in the galleries. The subject in general was colonial art, since fifth-grade 
classes in Cleveland have both American history and picture study. The 
questions were given to 59 classes from 26 schools, totaling 2024 children. 
The results were scored and statistics arranged on the basis of “X,” “Y,” 
and “Z” groups; first, as to intelligence in response to the tests; second, on 
the basis of home environment; and third, on racial differences.
-P-A-G-E-348

Findings. The questions were answered relatively better by the “Y” 
and “Z” children than by the ““X” children. The “X” child did not score 
high. The “Z” child scored higher than one would be led to expect from 
other comparative studies of “X,” “Y,” and “Z’” groups. This suggests 
the conclusion that the child of low intelligence profits by the touch with 
the concrete objects which he gets in museums. ‘The “X” child evidently 
was not offered enough chance for original thinking and sufficient richness 
of material in the lessons given. 
The experiment is being continued this year with a view to finding the 
right type of lesson for the ““X” child. Obviously the same lesson can not 
be given to the three groups of children. Home environment and racial 
differences, as they appeared in this experiment, were factors subordinate to 
that of the “X,” “Y,” “Z” grouping—that is, to general intelligence as 
measured by standard tests. 
The studies in drawing and art appreciation that have been made help 
the elementary teacher to provide instruction which is in some measure ap- 
propriate both from the standpoint of the child and of the curriculum as a 
whole. Little children draw to express themselves. Their earliest efforts 
are scribbles meaningless to the adult. Their later drawings are more pur- 
poseful and begin to have meaning even for the adult. Genuine art in- 
struction can and should begin with very young children. This is most 
often accomplished when pupils are given opportunity to draw to express 
themselves and to interpret for themselves beautiful pictures by reading, 
directly from the pictures, the stories that the pictures tell. Children draw- 
ing to please themselves most often represent people, houses, trees, furni- 
ture, vehicles, animals, toys, flowers, and other things that they love. The 
drawings of young children always tell a story. They often show people 
and things in action. Children prefer strongly contrasting colors to weak 
colors of similar hue, value, or chroma. 
Telling something often furnishes a motive sufficient to inspire good 
drawing. Young children should not be required to draw from ob- 
jects. In the elementary school, design should be stressed far more than 
representation if the instruction is to be of any value in the field of art ap- 
preciation. However, in the teaching of drawing as a part of the elementary 
school subject called art, a generous supply of good pictorial reference ma- 
terial should always be at hand. By means of this material esthetic ideals 
can be developed which will become standards for artistic expression and 
selection. 
In the subject of art, methods of teaching similar to those advised for 
other elementary school subjects should be used. Opportunity should be 
offered continually for genuine experience in purposing, planning, execut- 
ing, and judging. Critical, fair judgment of one’s own work and the work 
of others makes for a much needed social and emotional stability. Knowing 
how things are done, the amount of time, effort, and labor involved in pro- 
duction makes for better social and emotional adjustment. The results and
-P-A-G-E-349
  ‘THe Tuirp YEARBOOK 349   
conclusions of scientific investigation should be made use of in art as in 
other phases of education. The development of tests for factual informa- 
tion relating to art should be encouraged as well as the development of 
tests for the measurement of skill in drawing. A distinction should be 
made between the esthetic phase of art instruction and the technical phase 
that necessitates drill in execution. On the content side the subject of art 
should be made to connect closely with the other subjects of the curriculum. 
The project method should be used. Problem solving should play an im- 
portant part. 
There is need for careful and scientific analysis of the content of the 
subject of art, the aims of instruction, and the principles underlying in- 
struction in design, representation, color, construction, and lettering. If 
these principles are applied only in drawing as a school subject, the results 
will be unsatisfactory. The principles must be so taught as to apply to all 
situations in order that they may function in the life of the child, and so 
that the subject of art may contribute much to every other subject in the 
course of study. Consequently, art education should be given an important 
place in the normal-school training of every grade teacher, and it should 
also be be given more emphasis in the elementary curriculum, more time, 
and the needed equipment and supplies. 
STUDY NO. 9g. Riker, Olive M. Color preferences of elementary 
school children. A master’s thesis on file in the Library of the University 
of Wisconsin. 
Problem. (1) Do children prefer intense or saturated colors, or do 
they prefer a tint or shade of those colors? 
(2) In this, are there any sex differences? 
(3) Is there any difference in choice as children increase in age? 
(4) Is their choice affected by their environment or the locality in which 
they live? 
Method. Four colors with one tint and one shade of each were used: 
red, blue, yellow and green, making twelve colors in all. Four charts were 
used from which the children made their choices. On these charts no color 
was in the same position on the chart twice, and no color was next to any 
other color twice. ‘This was to avoid the influences that colors have on 
each other. The chart itself was neutral gray, 26 by 22 inches. Colored 
papers were used, each three inches square. Each color had a black letter 
of identification under it. 
To correlate with English experiments in the same field, the child was 
given a printed card with places for six choices. Six points were given for 
the first choice, five for the second, four for the third and so on to the sixth, 
which received but one point, and averages computed. 
The children were questioned as follows: Which color on this chart do 
you like best? Put on the first line the letter under the color. Similar 
procedure followed for the remaining five choices and the same process ap-

plied to the four charts. A total of 1199 elementary school children in Wis- 
consin, including grades one to eight, were tested. : 
Findings. First choice was given to intense or saturated color as was 
the second choice, red ranking first, followed closely by intense blue, with 
a tint of red for third choice. Girls preferred a tint of red for first choice. 
Summary of first choices arranged in order: 
General Girls Boys 
1. Red Red Tint Red 
2. Blue Blue Blue 
3. Red Tint Red Green 
4. Green Red Tint Blue Tint 
5. Blue Tint Green Red Shade 
6. Red Shade Red Shade Blue Tint 
7. Blue Shade Green Tint Blue Shade 
8. Green Tint Blue Shade (7) Green Shade 
9. Green Shade Green Shade Green Tint 
10. Yellow Yellow Yellow 
11. Yellow Tint Yellow Tint Yellow Tint 
12. Yellow Shade Yellow Shade Yellow Shade (11) 
Answering the questions included in the statement of the problem: 
(1) In the first eight «grades, children seem to show an inclination 
towards the saturated colors. 
(2) There seems to be a slight desire for girls to like more tints and 
shades than do the boys. 
(3) With changing age, there seems to be a steady change' of choice. 
Red is constant for boys with a tint of red remaining with the girls. Both 
boys and girls show a steady increase in favor of blue. A tint of blue 
shows an increase with girls, but a slight decrease with boys. The shade 
of blue seems to be unpopular with boys of all ages and shows a steady de- 
cline in favor with girls. Boys and girls have a growing appreciation for 
green. Appreciation for tints of green decline accompanied by a growing 
desire for green shades. Yellow remains constant with girls but drops 
with boys. A tint of yellow shows an upward trend with both boys and 
girls. Children in the lower grades indicate a slight preference for pale 
colors. 
(4) Social conditions were marked by decided changes in the color 
preferences.

Problem. Since it seems that writing has developed through the chan- 
nels of drawing, and: because a child follows the course of primitive man 
in his learning process, the question naturally follows whether there is any
-P-A-G-E-351
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 351 
  
direct relation between the drawing act and the writing act, and con- 
versely if he writes poorly will he draw poorly? The following ques- 
tions were considered: 
1. Does large freehand drawing have the advantage of establishing a poise and 
muscular control which will facilitate the acquisition of penmanship? 
2. Will drawing give fundamental muscles the development needed for writing? 
3. Should the child learn to draw and write at the same time or would it profit 
him to learn the former first? 
4. Does drawing which is healthful and hygenic prepare in an easy and ‘nat- 
ural way for the more exacting task of writing? 
5. Do the habits of neatness, care in execution, and good forms established in 
drawing aid in the teaching of writing? 
6. Is there any sex difference in the ability to draw? In the ability to write? 
Method. Test in Grade One. Pencils and paper were passed and the 
following preliminary statement was made: ‘“Today we are going to have 
a new writing game. I shall read some sentences to you. You will write 
them as nicely as you can, but instead of writing the last word, draw a 
picture.’ A typical sentence begins: This is a bird. 
In Grade Two. The sentences increased in difficulty while two pictures 
drawn from memory accompanied each sentence, as “I saw a (boy) play- 
ing (ball).” In grades three and four each pupil was given a sheet of 
paper upon which were drawn geometric figures. “They were given 
drawing paper and told to reproduce these figures as nearly like the copy 
as they could. A writing sample accompanied each drawing. The tests 
for grades five, six and seven, excepting increasingly difficult drawings to 
reproduce, including vase and other forms, were similar to grades three 
and four. 
Scoring. The rank method as recommended by Fred C. Ayer in his 
Psychology of drawing was adopted, necessitating a careful comparison of 
the drawings and arranging them in the order of ability shown in each. 
The same plan was used for ranking the writing ability. The average and 
chance differences were estimated by the Ayre’s formula. The numerical 
value of the correlation was found by the use of Pierson’s method adapted 
to rank differences. 
Findings. From the coefficients worked out, the obvious conclusion is 
that a direct, positive correlation exists between drawing and writing, 
higher in the lower than in the upper grades. In the lower grades, the de- 
gree of correlation is higher among the boys than among the girls while in 
the higher grades the reverse is true. 
It has been noted that the young child displays excess muscular activity 
while attempting to write, but if the same child is watched while he 
draws, these movements are absent. It is because his drawing is large and 
free. It would therefore appear to be a good plan to train the hand through 
drawing and develop a steadiness of attention and sureness of eye before 
teaching writing, which involves very complex and finely codrdinated move- 
ments. Meumz-in advocates that little writing should be done when the 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
    
352 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
child first begins, and that little should be acquired as unconsciously as 
possible. However, the child should be allowed to express himself freely 
on large surfaces in drawing. Drawing is healthful and hygienic and pre- 
pares in a natural and easy way for the more exacting task of writing. 
It would profit the child to learn to draw first because the large free 
work he does in drawing will make the more difficult task of writing easier 
to acquire. 
If the correlation is direct and positive as between the abilities to write 
and to draw, then training in the essential habits of neatness, care and ob- 
servation for drawing must be factors in that correlation since they are 
dominant factors in the ability te draw well.

MUSIC 
Jacob Kwalwasser, Head of Department of Public School Music, State University 
of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, Chairman 
Suggested Major Problems in the Formation of the Curriculum in Music 
1. What standards of achievement in music should sixth-grade children 
meet? 
2. To what extent should the course of study in music recognize indi- 
vidual differences? Should there be uniform curricular require- 
ments for all students? 
3. Should the course of study in music be built upon music as a science or 
music as an art? 
4. To what extent should makers of courses of study recognize the sensory 
handicaps and variations in children? Should a special curriculum 
be devised for selected groups? 
5. When shall the teaching of music as a science begin in the elementary 
schools? 
6. How shall a course of study in music provide for training in musical 
appreciation and memorization? 
7. To what extent shall scientific testing and standardization be a factor 
in the making of a course of study in music? 
8. What time allotment should be considered in making a course of 
study in music? 
9. In what form should the course of study be prepared: printed book, 
leaflets, special bulletins? 
10. Has assembly singing a place in every course of study? 
11. To what extent should technical exercise, in distinction from songs, be 
used in a course of study? 
12. Most effective methods of training monotones? 
13. Should music be approached through rhythm? ‘What place should 
rhythm work have in the music curriculum? 
“The art of music and the graphic and plastic arts are far behind other academic 
subjects in the attempt to apply the scientific method to their problem of subject 
matter, theory and pedagogy. This is due to two principal causes: first, that the 
typical artistic mind is seldom interested in the scientific aspect of the art; and 
second, that these arts have not yet been thoroughly stabilized and assigned their 
proper places in the public school curriculum. To this should be added the fact 
that even today the real artist and musician are primarily engrossed in the art 
interest and leave to the pedagog and educational administrator, such as the 
supervisor of art and music, the task of effecting pedagogical adjustments. 
“Because of the extravagant claims made by enthusiasts for music education, 
and their indiscriminate attempts to force a flat universal music requirement upon 
every child in the public schools regardless of his innate capacities or abilities to 
profit by such education, the wholesome growth of music in the public schools has 
been seriously impeded. Little wonder that many leaders in the field of education 
[354]
-P-A-G-E-355
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 355   
have shown indifference and even hostility at times, to some of the naive claims 
made for music education. 
“In attempting to apply the scientific procedure to the content and pedagogy of 
music, the pioneer faces the attitude of indifference on the part of educational ad- 
ministrators; aloofness and suspicion on the part of creative musicians; and 
amused tolerance on the part of the school music supervisor. As a result, the 
meager contributions which have been made, have fallen as crumbs from the 
tables of other interests, such as psychology of individual differences, and the 
psychology of music.’—Carl E. Seashore. 
Experimental Studies in Music Education 
Probably more scientific work has been done on problems 1, 2, 4, and 7, 
than upon any others in public school music education. Little or no work 
of a scientific nature has been done on the other problems listed. It is 
necessary, therefore, that this report be limited to a discussion and critical 
evaluation of those experimental studies which have a bearing on the prob- 
lems enumerated. 
I. Measurement of Talent 
A. The Seashore measures of musical talent.—Probably the most 
epoch-making work in the history of music education is that of Seashore 
and his associates in the State University of Iowa on the analysis and 
measurement of musical talent. On the sensory side, musicianship is ana- 
lyzed into its irreducible elements. For each of these elements, such as the 
sense of pitch, the sense of rhythm, etc., specific quantitative measurements 
are devised. 
‘These tests make it possible for us to discover the exact musical nature 
of the child. They make it possible for the teacher to conserve musical 
talent. With the aid of these tests, music education may now be adapted to 
utilize the child’s innate capacities. The tests reveal the magnitude of in- 
dividual differences in endowment. If the teacher realizes fully the signifi- 
cance of these differences, it will enable her to give each child a musical 
opportunity commensurate with his actual capacity. In order to facilitate 
the discussion of this work, it may be divided advantageously and treated 
under three headings—namely, value to the child, value to the teacher, 
and value to the schools. 
1. Value to the child—(a) he Seashore Measures of Musical Talent 
tests may be used for the discovery of talent hitherto unrecognized and un- 
developed. The measures referred to are the sense of pitch, time, intensity, 
consonance, rhythm, and tonal memory. Frequently, the possessor of talent 
in music is entirely unaware of its presence and therefore may make no ef- 
* This review is based upon C. E. Seashore’s Psychology of musical talent and 
numerous articles such as Recent progress in the psychology of musical talent, 
Music Teachers’ National Conference Proceedings, 1920. “A survey of musical 
talent in public schools,” Studies in Child Welfare, Vol. I, No. 2, “Avocational 
guidance in music,” Journal of Applied Psychology, December, 1917, Vol. 1, pp. 
342-348. 
 
-P-A-G-E-356

    fort to develop it. Investigations reveal that children are not always given 
music lessons because they are gifted. No defense need be made for the 
proposition that to the talented should go the opportunities for musical edu- 
cation and development. 
(b) The tests show the magnitude of individual differences. It is er- 
roneously assumed that musical endowments are fairly equally distributed. 
There is an enormous difference in the musical capacities of individuals, 
as is revealed by these tests. In the same pitch alone, for example, it is the 
common experience of examiners to find children in the average schoolroom 
who have one hundred times more sensitiveness in this specific capacity than 
the poorer members of the class. What is true of the sense of pitch is true 
of the other five capacities. 
(c) They reveal deficiencies that may or may not be suspected. A child 
may be entirely unaware of the exact nature of his musical make-up, and 
discover after much painful experience that his musical disabilities are such 
as to disqualify him for music study. ‘This condition could have been re- 
vealed instantly by testing. 
(d) These tests may reveal ear defects that may need immediate atten- 
tion. The writer’s experience with a boy in high school seems apropos. The 
boy was a violinist and reported to both the orchestra and the harmony class. 
He held a responsible position in the orchestra and filled it capably, 
but his sense of hearing that originally controlled his finger movements 
was substituted by kinaesthesis and motor imagery. His intonation was ap- 
parently as good as it had ever been, but his ears were not functioning. 
The test revealed that his hearing was equal to that of the lowest five per 
cent. A medical examination followed. ‘Treatment restored the hearing 
that might have been lost, had it not been detected in its early stages. 
(e) These tests may aid the pupil in selecting an instrument. It often 
happens that a child gets an obsession for an instrument for which he is en- 
tirely unsuited by nature. Such an undertaking always results in great dis- 
appointment for the child and a changed attitude toward music thereafter. 
It is patent that a child ‘with a low pitch discrimination is disqualified 
from studying the string instruments, where fine discrimination is con- 
stantly demanded. ‘This obstacle may not hinder the child as much if he 
can be persuaded to study an instrument that does not involve so much 
auditory sensitivity. 
2. Value to the teacher—(a) The Seashore tests may aid the teacher in 
adapting the training in music to the nature of the child. It must be re- 
membered that nothing that the teacher may attempt to do can create 
musical talent where it does not exist. The music teacher may only utilize 
it where it is found. This musical axiom does not seem to be very well 
understood. It is as impossible for the teacher to create talent as it was 
for the alchemist to transmute the baser metals into gold. The teacher 
should know the proficiencies and deficiencies of each child in order to 
best develop each individual.
-P-A-G-E-357
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 657)   
(b) They may serve the teacher as placement tests. Public school music 
as it is administered today is oblivious to the fact that all children are not 
equally endowed, and often a bright child who has done little or no work 
is commended for his accomplishment, whereas the dullard who has worked 
up to his highest level of achievement, but who has not attained what his 
more gifted classmate attained, is roundly censured. The difficulty is at- 
tributable to the fact that the music groups are not homogeneous in respect 
to their capacities or accomplishment. Some way must be found to take 
care of the superior in music. The superior child is often retarded, because 
the music instruction, designed as it is to educate the inferiors in the class, 
is not sufficiently ambitious to make the ‘superior work. If children were 
grouped according to their innate capacity and ability to achieve, much 
more progress could be made with music instruction in the public schools. 
(c) These tests may be employed by the teacher as a check on what the 
child is doing and what the child is capable of doing. This would aid the 
teacher in discovering those who are working and those who are not apply- 
ing themselves. Such a procedure would aid in replacing a very inade- 
quate system of grading by a more adequate one. 
3. Value to the school—There can be no doubt that music education 
can be facilitated and made more effectual and economical by the employ- 
ment of talent and accomplishment tests. We are in the midst of a cam- 
paign to universalize musical education. ‘This campaign gives music to 
larger and larger numbers of unfit and tends to underrate and neglect the 
gifted. It is not the purpose of the writer to speak disparagingly about 
the attempts of educators to universalize the teaching of music, but it is 
necessary to show that this movement has resulted in maladjustment and 
great economic waste. 
It is recommended that the measures of music talent be introduced in 
the fifth grade first, for this is the earliest age for which music talent test- 
ing can be made satisfactorily, and it is early enough to make serious ar- 
rangements for a musical education. The tests should then be repeated 
again in the eighth grade, just before the great sorting of children into vo- 
cations of practical life, and into elective courses in high school. 
Brief as this review is, it nevertheless gives the reader some idea of the 
scope and value of talent testing. Already educators are beginning to ask to 
what extent the sensory handicaps and variations of children should be 
recognized in making courses of study. As music education is being ad- 
ministered today, little or no attention is given to this condition, but as 
educators realize more and more the magnitude and significance of indi- 
vidual differences, special courses of study in music will be devised for 
the more homogeneous groups, and uniform curricular requirements for all 
grade school children will be a thing of the past.

erature on the psychology of the musician,” by Max Schoen,’ review the

works of Révész, Schiissler, and Pannenborg. These men have made 
significant contributions to the psychology of the musical mind. 
“In 1913, Révész made a preliminary report on an analysis of a boy 
especially gifted musically, but it was not until 1916 that the full report 
appeared, and not until 1920 that he published an inventory of musicalness 
based on his study of the boy prodigy. The problems with which Révész 
concerns himself in the 1920 study are: 1. Can a method be devised which 
will identify the musical mind before the beginning of instruction, even in 
cases less exceptional than that of the boy examined? 2. Could such a 
method be applied to adults and to the musically trained? His aim, then, 
was to find a method of identifying the musical, adapted to children and 
adults, and to the musically trained and untrained. For this purpose he 
devised eight tests, based upon musical and acoustical factors, and gave these 
to 63 boys and girls from seven to twelve years of age. The tests are as 
follows: 1. The rhythmic sense. Twelve rhythmic groups were arranged 
in order of difficulty. In the first part of the test the rhythms were pre- 
sented monotonically and the children were asked to reproduce the rhythm 
with handclaps. In the second part of the test the same rhythmic forms 
were presented melodically and a like response was called for from the chil- 
dren. 2. Absolute pitch. For the second test the experimenter sounded a 
tone on the piano and the observers were called upon to reproduce the 
tone on the instrument. 3. Octave recognition and transposition. ‘This 
test Révész found too easy for his observers. 4. Relative pitch. He first 
produced an interval and then sounded any tone on the piano and asked 
the child to reproduce vocally the given interval, with the new tone for its 
basis. 5 and 6. The harmonic sense. In these tests the children were 
asked to reproduce vocally the constituent tones of chords. 7 and 8. 
Melodic memory and playing by ear. The seventh test deals with memory 
for melody, and the eighth with the ability to play by ear a known tune. 
“Révész assumed the vocal reproduction of a melody to have the greatest 
diagnostic value, and by correlating the other tests with the seventh test, 
he concluded that the sense of rhythm does not possess great musical 
significance, but that the spontaneous instrumental reproduction of a known 
melody, absolute pitch, vocal transposition of an interval, and also the 
ability to analyze simultaneous intervals, are characteristic manifestations 
of musicalness. Révész’s investigation has two great merits—his inventory 
has an empirical basis, and his test material has musical significance. The 
number of his observers was too small, however, for the establishment of 
norms. 
“In his study on the earliest appearance of talent, Révész claims that 
musical talent necessarily makes its appearance in early youth; at first 
appears teclinical equipment, or virtuosity, later, power of interpretation, 
and then creative power. An examination of the great composers shows 
that the full development of the creative powers is reached between the 
twentieth and thirtieth years.
-P-A-G-E-359
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 359 
“Several briefer studies are available that help to throw light upon 
specific factors in the more extensive treatments of Révész and Seashore. 
Schiissler attempts to account for the unmusical child in a paper based upon 
historical and statistical material. In the first part of the paper, he reviews 
briefly the works of Billroth, Max Meyer, Stumpf, Von Meyer, Rupp, 
Révész, and several others, as well as the contributions of the anatomical 
and physiological bases of musicalness. His own contribution consists of 
a statistical examination of two hundred unmusical children, the criterion 
for unmusicalness being attainment of a certain grade in school singing. 
Schiissler’s conclusions, based upon the historical review and his statistical 
data, are as follows: 1. There are between five and ten per cent of un- 
musical people. The majority of the unmusical, if not all, are not beyond 
profiting by musical instruction, and should, therefore, not be neglected, 
but rather given well-planned and intensive instruction. 2. For musical 
or unmusical capacity, interval memory is of greatest significance. 3. 
Absolute pitch is of significance only for outstanding musical gift. The 
unmusical, as compared with the musical, are as a whole less gifted than 
the musical, i.e., they are not only inferior musically, but also in other 
mental capacities. 4. Forty-one per cent of the unmusical, fifty-seven per 
cent of the half musical, and seventy-nine per cent of the musical, make 
satisfactory progress in school. ‘The school work of the musical is fifteen 
per cent superior to that of the unmusical. 
“Schiissler’s findings on the relation between intelligence and musical- 
ness are in accord with those of Stumpf, who found that musical children 
are, as a whole, better students than the unmusical. 
“The Pannenborgs examined 3860 children, 423 musicians, and the 
biographies of twenty-one composers in an attempt to derive the intellectual 
and emotional characteristics of the musician. ‘Their conclusions agree 
with those of Schiissler and Stumpf. Of all the children, 342 boys and 152 
girls were designated as musical. The musical children were advanced in 
their school work beyond their years, while the musician was found to have 
extensive intellectual interests and to be widely gifted, particularly in 
languages, literature, history, geography, mathematics, natural history, and 
drawing.” 
II. Rhythm and Training 
Great interest has been shown recently in rhythmic training. For years 
it had no place whatever in our schools, but now it is being stressed by most 
music teachers and supervisors, as being basic. Music, they claim, must be 
approached through rhythm. Dalcroze believes that an individual may be 
made musical by rhythmic training. Absurd as this claim is, it is shared by 
many music educators. But does rhythmic training improve one’s sense of 
rhythm? ‘This question can be answered only by experimental investiga- 
tion. In 1923, Miss Naomi Klauer undertook to study the effect of 
training on the sense of rhythm.t The Seashore Rhythm Test was given

mediate grades, Thesis, State University of Iowa.

to seventy-five children in grades four, five, and six. This was followed by 
intensive rhythmic drill for a period of two months, in which every defen- 
sible rhythmic device was used. 
Such exercises as marching to music; beating time, by swinging the arms 
synchronously with a beat; breathing in such a way as to maintain a con- 
currence between beats and inhalation of breath; clapping the hands so as 
to give the child tactual, kinaesthetic, auditory and visual experience; tap- 
ping out some of the actual rhythms found in the rhythm test; rhythmic 
exercises in discrimination; these and many more were used in an attempt 
to give the child as rich an experience in rhythm as could be afforded. The 
average gain in the second scores over the first was found to be 3.4 per 
cent. 
Seventy-five intermediate grade school children in another school were 
tested twice in a period of three days without any intervening rhythmic 
training in order to ascertain the maximal effect of improvement due to 
the repetition of the test alone. ‘The average gain for these three grades 
was found to be 3.9 per cent. 
Miss Klauer concludes that ‘‘this capacity is relatively fixed. The chil- 
dren remained substantially where they were, in spite of the intensive 
rhythmic drill to which they were subjected. In this sense, as in the 
other basic music senses, the music educator must be cognizant of the extent 
and magnitude of individual differences. Furthermore, the teacher must 
know definitely the amount of the capacity possessed by each child and 
devise a program of procedure that will make it possible for each child and 
realize all that he can on the rhythmic endowment he possesses.”’ 
A. Rhythm and Past Musical Training 
In order to ascertain the influence of past training, on the sense of rhythm, 
DeGraff? measured 464 university sophomores, part of whom had had 
training and part of whom had had no training. Each individual was 
asked to record the number of half hour lessons he had taken in music. 
The scores of the trained were then correlated with the scores of the 
untrained in an attempt to show statistically the influence of music train- 
ing. The Seashore Rhythm Test was used in this study. The mean of 
the trained scores was found to be 75.50 while the mean of the untrained 
group was 75.51, which gives the trained group no advantage. That is, 
the sense of rhythm is more or less innate. Those who have it may utilize 
it in their music study, but those who are devoid of any great amount of it 
do not acquire it by training. 
III. Musical Accomplishment Testing? 
The Kwalwasser-Ruch musical accomplishment test—This test was de- 
vised last year by the writer in collaboration with Professor Giles M.

versity of Iowa.

Ruch. This test measures musical knowledge acquired from the fourth to 
the twelfth grade inclusive. A thorough analysis was made of the most 
representative courses of study in music in the United States, in order to 
ascertain the nature of the material to be included in such a test. Ten 
subjects were derived from the analysis of these courses of study, and a 
test measuring each formulated. They are: 
1. Knowledge of musical symbols and terms. 
2. Recognition of syllable names from the staff notation. 
. Detection of pitch errors in the notation of a familiar melody. 
. Recognition of time errors in the notation of a familiar melody. 
. Knowledge of pitch or letter names of base and treble notes. 
. Knowledge of time signatures. 
. Knowledge of principal major and minor keys. 
. Knowledge of note values and their symbols. 
. Knowledge of rest values and their symbols. 
10. Recognition of ten familiar melodies from the notation alone. CON AKH SY 
All of the accomplishment tests in music are group tests and as such 
furnish us with a convenient method of ascertaining what has been 
achieved in music by the individual, the grade, or the school as compared 
with other individuals, grades, and schools. ‘The author states that the 
standardized test is, at the present time, one of the best aids the music 
teacher can employ to raise the standards of school music. 
What constitutes sixth-grade achievement in music? How does sixth- 
grade differ from fifth or eighth grade achievement? Is fifth-grade achieve- 
ment in music the same all over the United States or do we find what is 
achieved in the fifth grade in one school attained in the third grade else- 
where? ‘These questions and many others may be answered by applying 
a reliable test to the different grades. With the aid of norms, the music 
supervisor may easily discover how her particular group compares with 
groups of the same age and grade elsewhere and, by the same token, whether 
the instruction she is giving is superior or inferior to that given elsewhere. 
Scores of a reliable test have definite meaning and permit of definite com- 
parisons. ‘Those needing special training may be discovered and weak 
points in the music course detected. Remedial methods may then be applied 
in an effort to bring the music work up to the level of attainment indicated 
by the norms. 
Accomplishment tests! may help to improve the standards of music and 
music instruction in our schools. They show objectively both progress and 
retardation. ‘They aid the teacher in giving her adequate knowledge of 
what the individuals have accomplished. Above all, the exceptional student 
may be discovered and given an opportunity to develop commensurate with 
his endowments. It is to the credit of the music educators of this country 
that they are encouraging and fostering scientific testing in their subject. 
+Other music accomplishment tests, now available, are the Beach, Mosher, Gil- 
dersleve, Torgerson, and Hutchinson.

B. Sight-singing Testing 
Early last year, a sight-singing test by E. K. Hillbrand, professor of edu- 
cation, Dakota Wesleyan University, appeared which was the first attempt 
to measure objectively, the ability of the intermediate grade school child to 
translate musical symbols into sounds. ‘This test attempts not only to deter- 
mine one’s proficiency as a sight-singer but also to diagnose difficulties in the 
deficient performance. ‘The test is an individual test, for according to the 
author “group tests in sight-singing are impracticable.” 
The test contains six short songs. ‘The pupil is permitted to study the 
songs a few minutes and then is asked to sing them, without any help or 
accompaniment. Each pupil is tested singly in a quiet room. The various 
errors made by the pupil while singing are recorded on a copy of the songs. 
Aside from the fact that this test is an individual one and requires too 
much time to give, it is difficult to score. This test, however, does suggest 
a procedure that is important for the future of public school music. Sight- 
singing is a most important part of the music course, yet this is the first 
attempt to measure objectively sight-singing proficiency. It is conceivable 
that within the next few years a number of good group sight-singing tests 
will be produced. 
C. Music Appreciation Testing 
Probably the most elusive trait to measure is one’s appreciation of music 
No one has yet succeeded in measuring the aesthetic response to music 
successfully. "’I'wo Courtis Standard Research Tests on music attempt to 
measure one’s ability to associate experimental facts with music—an ability 
which may be entirely foreign to genuine music appreciation. The first 
test measures one’s ability to associate life activities with music in which the 
rhythm predominates, and is incorrectly called ‘Recognition of Charac- 
teristic Rhythms.” The second test measures one’s ability to recognize 
“Mood from Melody.” ‘It has long been a fad in teaching music apprecia- 
tion, to give every composition presented in the course, a program. Many 
of these programs are manufactured for the occasion and have no integral 
relationship to the music presented. ‘This method may stimulate the 
imagination, but it evokes a response that may be extraneous to the in- 
tention of the composer. ‘The ability to describe or name a composition is 
no index of one’s appreciation of music. 
Under the title “Scales for Measuring Judgment of Orchestral Music,” 
M. R. Trabue reports an interesting investigation on musical “taste.” Mr. 
Mohler planned the investigation and completed the field work in 1920. 
Phonograph records of sixteen different musical compositions were used. 
The relative merits of these compositions were judged by expert musicians 
and other intelligent adults, and each composition was assigned a numerical 
value designating its comparative worth. The test was administered in 
* Journal of Educational Psychology, December, 1923.
-P-A-G-E-363
  Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 363 
  
such a manner that the individuals detecting the smallest differences in 
general merit received the highest scores. 
The most significant finding of this study was “that the characteristics 
measured by these tests are easily improved by training. ‘There seems to 
be an unusually large opportunity for improvement of taste for orchestral 
music through musical training and experience. In almost every case, the 
group that received training increased its median score ten or more times 
as much as the untrained group. 
In concluding this report, Trabue presents statistical evidence on the rela- 
tionship of ability measured by, these scales, and general academic ability. 
The coefficient of correlation between the musical judgment scores and the 
mental ability scores, based on 39 cases was only .16, although the quad- 
rant of the correlation table indicating low academic ability and high 
musical judgment, contained but one individual. He concludes, therefore, 
that one must have a sufficient amount of academic ability to make 70 points 
on the Miller ability test before he can learn to judge orchestral music 
successfully, but that high general academic ability does not at all imply 
high ability to judge orchestral music. 
While the results of this study are significant in themselves, the impor- 
tant contribution of this investigation is in its method of attacking a most 
difficult problem, that of zsthetic response. 
IV. Curriculum Practices in Junior High School and Grades 5 and 6* 
This authoritative work covers the curriculum practices of fourteen edu- 
cational centers. No effort was made to test the results achieved in the 
fourteen school systems. The report arrives at one perfectly clear conclu- 
sion—namely, that “the periods of time devoted in various school systems 
to a given subject of instruction and to sub-divisions of that subject are im- 
pressively different. ‘The scientific determination of the results of teaching 
is leading in all of these centers to a scientific evaluation of the materials 
of instruction. A scientific analysis of the materials of teaching must in 
turn lead to an analysis of the objectives of instruction. If objectives are 
to be scientifically established, they must be based upon a scientific study 
of the needs of pupils as revealed in modern society and of the skills, abili- 
ties and attitudes conditioning useful citizenship.” 
In averaging the number of minutes a week allotted to each constant by 
the fourteen school systems, it appears that less time is spent on music than 
on any other junior high school subject. Seventy minutes is spent on music 
in the seventh, sixty-seven in the eighth and seventy-three in the ninth 
grade. The average proportional allotment of the school week to the con- 
stants of the curriculum in the fourteen school systems for the junior high 
school reveals that only 4.3 per cent of the school time is devoted to music

in the seventh grade, 4.0 per cent in the eighth and 4.4 per cent in the ninth 
grade. 
How to make a curriculum, by Franklin Bobbitt, contains much evidence 
of a tendency to ascertain the social values of music. ‘Music electives are, 
therefore, entering the program of studies as club activities, as major elec- 
tives in a fine arts curriculum, and as electives supplementary to other 
major electives or as additional enrichment courses for pupils who can 
carry extra work. ‘The important socializing effect of the expansion of 
music courses, both required and elective, should be recalled in an evalua- 
tion of the development.” 
V. Sixth Grade Achievement 
At the fourteenth annual meeting of the Music Supervisors’ National 
Conference held in St. Joseph, Missouri, 1921, members of the Educa- 
tional Council submitted a standard course of study for graded schools. 
This course was formulated for the “good or average school representing 
an easily attainable and a desirable ideal for all schools.” This course re- 
ceived the unanimous endorsement of the members of the Council after it 
had been “thoroughly analyzed, section by section, phrase by phrase, word 
by word.” ‘The purpose of the course was to direct the attention of edu- 
cators to standards of attainments toward which the music work in schools 
generally should go. 
Attainments to be realized, year by year, are to be found at the end of 
each school grade. At the end of the sixth year, which “marks the close 
of the primary period, and the end of the sensory and associative stages in 
the child’s life,” the Council recommends eight definite attainments. 
Seven of these attainments were made the basis of a series of investiga- 
tions, undertaken by Miss Estelle Windhorst.’ This research was made 
possible by the generous grant of a fellowship to the State University of 
Iowa by the Julliard Musical Foundation of New York City. Objective 
measurements were devised and applied to each of the seven attainments 
formulated by the Council, in an effort to ascertain the feasibility, and the 
. extent to which each is being realized. Five large cities, highly distinguished 
for their public school music work, were used in making this study. 
First attainment—This attainment recommended by the Council for the 
sixth grade is that “every child shall have acquired the use of his singing 
voice and pleasure in song as a means of expression.” This attainment was 
not reached by all cities. While it is probably true that most children de- 
rive pleasure from singing, to other children it was plainly an irritant. 
Many children showed utter indifference in singing, revealing that their

musical imagination or emotion had not been aroused. Monotones were 
found, showing that there was a small percentage of children in the sixth 
grade who had not acquired “the use of their singing voices.” It might be 
added that all children were measured and rated on accuracy in intonation 
and sustaining the pitch. The examiner concludes that this attainment 
may be feasible, but is not realized by all. 
Second attainment—‘Every child shall have acquired a repertoire of 
songs which may be carried into the home and social life, including 
“America” and the “Star-Spangled Banner.” ‘The measurement of some 
500 children show that those who have found their singing voice were able 
to sing “America” and on the whole quite accurately, but to the great sur- 
prise of the examiner, “Silent Night” was even more universally known 
from memory. Due to its difficulty and unnatural range, “The Star- 
Spangled Banner’ was sung well only by children with exceptional voices. 
Many children were afraid to attempt it at all, and it was sung very in- 
accurately by the larger number who tried it. Songs learned in previous 
years and not frequently reviewed were sung inaccurately either rhyth- 
mically or melodically. While this aim is feasible, it, too, is not being 
generally achieved. Some school systems stress repertoire songs, while 
others neglect this phase of music instruction almost entirely. 
Third attainment—‘Every child shall have developed the aural power 
to know by sound that which he knows by sight and vice versa.’ This at- 
tainment is apparently too difficult. Less than 50 per cent of the children 
measured could recognize “The Star Spangled Banner” from notation; 
only 18 per cent could recognize “Silent Night” by sound. A distorted 
version of ““America”’ was presented to the children in which five measures 
were wrong melodically. Only 9 per cent of the 486 sixth grade children 
measured could detect all the wrong measures; 21 per cent were able to 
detect four wrong measures. ‘‘America,” probably the best-known song 
both by sight and sound, revealed how few children have attained this 
ability. 
Fourth attainment—‘Every child shall have the ability to sing at sight, 
using words, a unison song of hymn tune grade, and the easiest three-part 
songs; these to be in any key; to include any of the measures and rhythms 
in ordinary use; to contain any accidental signs and tones easily introduced ; 
and in general to be of the grade of difficulty of folk songs such as the 
“Minstrel Boy”; also knowledge of the major and minor keys and their 
signatures.’ Forming a tonal image from a notational symbol is a basic 
skill in sight-singing. Test I of the Kwalwasser-Ruch Accomplishment 
Test measures one’s knowledge of musical terms and symbols. It consists 
of twenty-five items. The mean score of the children measured 13. Evi- 
dently, many of the most common symbols and terms are not understood by 
sixth-grade pupils. The chromatics give children most trouble. The 
knowledge of key and time signatures is not noticeably acquired. The 
minor key signatures are hopelessly beyond the sixth-grade child, if we may 
depend upon the results of this investigation.
-P-A-G-E-366
  366 DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE   
Fifth attainment—‘Every child talented in musical performance shall 
have opportunity for its cultivation.” This attainment is both desirable 
and practicable. Most schools encourage participation in choruses, orches- 
tras and bands. The talented are thus afforded an opportunity to develop 
their musicianship. 
Sixth attainment—“The children shall have developed a love for the 
beautiful in music and taste in choosing their songs and the music to which 
they listen for the enjoyment and pleasure which only good music can give.” 
In spite of the fact that this attainment is very difficult to measure, it is, 
nevertheless, a most important one. 
Seventh attainment—‘The children shall have acquired the ability to 
appreciate the charm of design in songs sung; to give an account of the 
salient features of structure in a standard composition after a few hearings 
of it; to identify at least the three-part song form from hearing; and to 
recognize and give titles and composers of a reasonable number of standard 
vocal and instrumental compositions.” Only one item of this attainment 
was measured, namely “‘the recognition of standard vocal and instrumental 
compositions.” In this less than half of the children came up to this stand- 
ard formulated by the educational council. 
This survey of five schools which are far above the average in musical 
attainment, shows the difficulty of realizing some of the attainments of the 
standard course of study. It demonstrates the ease with which the “intan- 
gible” subjects of music may be measured objectively. It suggests a new 
method of procedure for making public school music surveys. It reveals 
the shortcomings of our present efforts to make music more effective and 
more influential in the lives of our children. It aids the music educator in 
applying the remedial measures necessary to improve both the teaching and 
the content of the subject. 
Before concluding this report, a word concerning the future studies in 
public school music seems apropos. ‘The arts are not easily subjected to the 
experimental procedure. Yet it is unlikely that music will be systematically 
and efficiently taught without the application of the experimental pro- 
cedure. The results already obtained more than warrant the expenditure 
of time and money on refining the methodology of music teaching. Finally, 
it promises to give to music education, a science of music pedagogy.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE 
SECRETARY 
Cincinnati Meeting, 1925 
To the President, Executive Committee, and Members of the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence: 
In accordance with the provisions of the constitution, adopted at the 
Chicago convention in 1922, the third annual report of the activities of the 
Department of Superintendence is presented herewith. It covers the period 
from January 1, 1924, to December 31, 1924. 
The year in review—The 1924 convention in Chicago, which empha- 
sized ‘Next Forward Steps in-American Education,” set a high standard 
of constructive thinking. Small topic group meetings replaced two general 
sessions and provided unusual opportunity for intimate discussion of im- 
portant problems. Chicago is handicapped by lack of a convenient ex- 
hibit hall. The plan of locating the exhibits in hotel rooms does not well 
adapt itself to our needs. The second Yearbook, which reviewed current 
elementary school curriculum practice, was distributed to members at Chi- 
cago. An official report of the convention proceedings was issued in May. 
The preparation of the 1925 Yearbook has been under the direction of 
the Commission on the Curriculum. The appointment of this Commission 
was authorized by vote of the Department in 1923, at Cleveland. The 
Commission met in Washington, June 30, and determined to collect and 
review research studies in the field of the elementary school curriculum. 
The Division of Research of the National Education Association under- 
took active responsibility for this task. Dr. Margaret M. Alltucker, as- 
sistant director of the division of research, secured much valuable material 
and assistance in the course of a series of conferences with curriculum 
specialists in Columbus, Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Iowa City, Den- 
ver, California, and elsewhere. At a second meeting, held October 23 and 
24, the Commission outlined a comprehensive plan of codperative effort for 
curriculum reconstruction, with a view to its consideration and adoption 
at the Cincinnati convention. Many people have contributed liberally of 
time and effort in the preparation of the 1925 Yearbook. Especial atten- 
tion is called to the twelve sub-committees listed at the beginning of Part 
III. Without their assistance, this volume would have been impossible. 
The Research Bulletin of the National Education Association has been 
mailed to all members of this Department during the year. These bulletins 
have dealt with teachers’ salaries, retirement laws, the curriculum, tenure, 
and facts on the public school for American Education Week. It was 
originally intended to issue a Quarterly of the Department of Superintend- 
ence, but on further consideration it seemed better to adopt a program of 
coéperation, thereby securing for our members the excellent publications of 
the Division of Research.

A small beginning has been made with the Educational Research Service, 
which was authorized two years ago. Forty cities are enrolled thus far. 
Subscribers are furnished with printed or multigraphed copies of recent 
educational studies, information is secured in response to individual in- 
quiries, special tabulations are made involving problems, such as teachers’ 
salaries, and an effort is being made to assist subscribers in solving the 
questionnaire evil. On account of the newness of the venture and the 
meagerness of our staff, only enough subscriptions were solicited to afford 
a fair test of the undertaking. If all goes well, a much greater number can 
be accepted next year. 
The executive committee—The Executive Committee consists of seven 
members. ‘The president and the first and second vice presidents are mem- 
bers ex-officio and are chosen annually. Four members chosen by election, 
hold office for terms of four years, one member retiring each year. Three 
meetings of the Executive Committee were held during 1924, the first be- 
ing in Chicago on February 24. Members present were Superintendents 
Smith, Beveridge, Clark, Cody, Condon, Ballou and McAndrew. Busi- 
ness transacted included approval of appointments for the Audit Commit- 
tee, Resolutions Committee, Tellers and Yearbook Committee. It was 
voted to contract for copies of the Research Bulletin of the National Edu- 
cation Association, to be mailed to all members of the Department, and to 
abandon the plan for the proposed Quarterly of the Department of Super- 
intendence. Ina resolution Dr. Randall J. Condon was commended for his 
excellent work in conducting the building exhibits at the last two conven- 
tions. 
The Executive Committee met again in the Auditorium Theater, Chi- 
cago, Thursday afternoon, February 28. All members were present. The 
Executive Secretary was authorized to pay convention bills when approved 
by the retiring president. The vacancy caused in the membership of the 
Executive Committee by the election of William McAndrew as president 
of the Department, was filled by the appointment for the unexpired term 
of Frank D. Boynton, superintendent of schools, Ithaca, N. Y. 
The third meeting of the Executive Committee was held in the Gibson 
Hotel, Cincinnati, Saturday, April 26. Members present were Super- 
intendents McAndrew, Maddox, Condon, Ballou, Clark, and Boynton. 
The first vice president, Payson Smith, was absent on account of illness. 
The budget for the year 1924 was submitted and adopted. It showed esti- 
mated income of $16,000, and estimated expenditure of $15,995.81. Ap- 
plications from various organizations for recognition in connection with 
the winter meeting were receiyed, and on motion, the Executive Secretary 
was instructed to advise the officers of all such organizations that the De- 
partment of Superintendence regretted its inability to secure the necessary 
hotel and other accommodations for additional groups. The publication in 
the Educational Review of suitable articles and news items was authorized. 
Mr. Edwin C. Broome, chairman of the Commission on the Curriculum,
-P-A-G-E-369
Tue Tuirp YEARBOOK 369   
  was present and reported progress. Following a discussion of the magni- 
tude of the undertaking, the following resolution was adopted : 
“The executive committee approves the suggestion that paid experts and clerical 
assistance be secured to aid the Commission, provided funds for the purpose can 
be secured. Inasmuch as no funds are available, a donation will be welcomed, 
with the understanding that the Department be entirely free to act as it sees fit.” 
In behalf of the Commission on the Curriculum, grateful acknowledg- 
ment is made to the Carnegie Corporation for $5000, made available in 
accordance with the above resolution for payment of travelling expenses 
and clerical service. 
The Executive Secretary reported that a vote of members of the Depart- 
ment on the question of time and place of the winter meeting had been 
taken by mail. The number who voted for the present date, during the 
last week of February, was 1232, while 281 asked for a change. To the 
question, “Would you wish to have the Department meet in the same city 
each year,” 578 voted “Yes” and 1216 voted “No.” For the 1925 Con- 
vention, a great majority favored a city in the Middle West, preferably one 
in which the Convention had not been held recently. ‘The Executive 
Committee thereupon considered invitations for the 1925 Convention. 
After a recess for the purpose of visiting the Cincinnati Music Hall and 
hotels, Cincinnati was selected as the convention city. 
Financial statement—The budget allotments adopted by the Executive 
Committee have been closely observed. The income exceeded the estimates 
by $1,637.93. The expenditures were $589.74 less than the budget allow- 
ance, thus making the balance at the close of the year over $2,000 more 
than at its beginning. 
The principal source of revenue is the $5 annual membership fee. 
‘Twelve hundred and sixty-three members were enrolled for 1922, 1650 for 
1923, and 2136 for 1924. We have set our goal for 1925 at 3000 members. 
By 1926 this should be increased to 4000, since there are at least that many 
eligible persons who attend the conventions more or less regularly. 
By agreement with the National Education Association, the net income 
from the commercial exhibits at the winter meetings is divided equally be- 
tween the Department and the parent association, each organization thus 
deriving funds for convention expenses. The active work of organizing and 
managing the exhibit is done by the Business Division of the National Edu- 
cation Association. 
Other income was received from the sale of Yearbooks, which was un- 
expectedly large, from the Educational Research Service, and from a dona- 
tion to the Department of the balance remaining in the convention fund 
contributed by the Chicago hotels. 
The financial statement submitted herewith covers the calendar year 
1924. It includes expenses of the Chicago convention and the preliminary 
expenditures for the 1925 meeting in Cincinnati. The details follow:

In conclusion—The work of the year has again demonstrated the im- 
portance of the help and good-will of friends. The headquarters staff of 
the National Education Association have rendered willing and competent 
assistance whenever opportunity offered. ‘The school organizations and 
the chambers of commerce of our convention cities, Chicago and Cincinnati, 
have diligently served our interests, frequently at great personal incon- 
venience. Our yearbook and our civic and art exhibits place us under 
new obligations of gratitude. 
The superintendent of schools:has no light responsibility. Public finance, 
business matters, school buildings, curriculum construction, records and 
reports, methods of organization, teachers’ meetings, are a few of the sub- 
jects with which he must concern himself. Moreover, these are but items 
in the great work of guiding and guarding the childhood of America. 
Upon the successful accomplishment of this task depends the future of our 
Nation and the preservation of its ideals. The Department of Superin- 
tendence, through its great winter meeting and year-round service, offers 
to superintendents of schools a comradeship of common interests and brings 
inspiration for renewed effort. 
Respectfully submitted, 
S. D. SHANKLAND, 
Executive Secretary.

PREFACE 
he 
A text-book for young children should succeed if it contains 
good pedagogical material stiffened and steadied by a 
modicum of plain common sense. Such is the central thought 
of this book. 
In the upper grades of grammar schools the study of 
English takes two directions: technical grammar, and com- 
position. There must be some grammar as a basis for study 
in the high-school grades; there should likewise be enough 
to form the groundwork for an actual understanding of 
the work in punctuation and composition. The composition 
exercises should cover a wide range while teaching princi- 
ples of structure, giving in clear outlines the principal 
divisions of discourse. “If these two lines can be made to 
converge and intérlace in one text, economy of time will 
be attained, accompanied by more intelligent effort; and 
the following pages constitute an attempt to organize the 
work of these grades into one line of progress as far as the 
nature of the subjects will permit. 
As the course is here planned for two years’ work, two 
lessons in grammar and three in composition are provided 
for each week’s assignment. The lessons in grammar are 
not an end in themselves: they are the basis of practice 
upon the principles of structure. The book is not, there- 
fore, to be regarded as a text-book in grammar. Analysis 
is the underlying support of the whole system: first, analysis 
of the sentence as a basis for parts of speech and their 
relations; second, analysis of the paragraph to find its con- 
stituents; third, analysis of the outline to give it consist-

6 PREFACE 
ency, definiteness, and well-chosen material; finally, analysis 
of the whole composition to find and properly place the 
effective parts. . 
In every detail of the book the author has endeavored to 
work solidly between two extremes: to avoid obscurity there 
is given plenty of simple explanation; yet to avoid stagnation 
of the pupil’s mind there is required enough work to call 
continually for original and constructive effort. And it is 
hoped that the reasonableness and definiteness of each 
assignment will go far towards bringing to the teacher 
excellent results with as little waste as possible. 
The freshness and vitality of the exercises selected, and 
the correlation with other expressive activities—such as 
drawing, brush work, paper cutting, silhouettes, plats and 
plans, etc.—will assist in keeping active the interest that 
vigorous young people are capable of exerting. 
I wish to express my obligation to the Perry Pictures 
Company for generous permission to use copies of their 
famous engravings; to the Youth's Companion for their 
courtesy in allowing the use of the many excellent clippings 
for dictation and paraphrasing; and to the supervisors and 
teachers of the Nashville.schools for the whole-souled enthu- 
siasm with which they assisted me with suggestions in the 
revision of the manuscript.

GROUP ONE. 
LESSON 1. 
THE SENTENCE. 
A child wrote a composition as follows: 
Once there was a large park in London and a man was driving some 
sheep and one of the sheep was overdriven and it lay down in the park 
and after a while a little boy came by and saw the sheep lying there. 
So he went to a spring and got his cap full of water and when he got 
back half of the water was gone and half he gave to the sheep. 
The child naturally tells a story orally just as he wrote 
this composition. He does not separate his thoughts. He 
talks on, putting in and, so, but, then, etc., to hold the parts 
of the story together. He thinks of the incidents of the story 
rather than the language in which he tells them. 
An important part of the training in school is to teach 
the young writer to form his thoughts clearly, one at a time, 
and to express them in clear sentences. Such connecting 
words as and, so, but, then, when needed, are to be used 
within the sentence, not at the beginning of it. 
A sentence is a thought expressed in words. 
Every statement is followed by a period. 
Exercise.—Rewrite the above composition, adding words 
necessary to the sense and leaving out connectives that are 
not needed. Make at least five sentences of it.

LESSON 2. 
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE. 
Every. sentence, since it expresses a thought, must have 
two parts: that of which something is said (called the 
subject), and that which says something about the subject 
(called the predicate). 
Examples: 
SUBJECT. PREDICATE. 
Somé trees give beautiful shade. , I 
Roses { smell sweet. 
| The man of honor | will always tell the truth. 
The subject of a sentence is that of which something is said. 
The predicate of a sentence is that which says something 
about the subject. 
Exercise.—Separate the subject and predicate of each 
of the following sentences by drawing a line between them: 
. August lived in a little town. 
. The town has paved streets. 
Great mountains are all around the town. 
. The boy saw a grand old Gothic church. 
. A cloister with beautiful marble columns and tombs is close at 
hand. 
The winters are long and very cold in that country. 
The good old burghers of Hall had shut their double shutters. 
. A tired post-boy blew a shrill blast. 
. The good folks of Hail go early to their beds. 
. Little August had been sent on a long errand outside the gates 
in the afternoon. . 
11. The moonlight shone on the gilded signs. 
12. A ruddy fire-light lit up a homely interior. 
13. The room had a walnut-wood press. 
14. Dorothea was a girl of seventeen, dark-haired and. serious, and 
with a sweet, sad face. ‘ VO

LESSON 3. 
ORAL COMPOSITION. 
Composition is the process of finding thoughts and giving 
them suitable expression. 
These thoughts may be largely one’s own, on some subject 
that he has considered carefully; or they may be the thoughts 
of others, which he has heard or read and which he may wish 
to reproduce. For example, a scientist making investigations 
in regard to comets may produce and expréss thoughts that 
are new to the whole human race. But a man who speaks 
or writes on United States history must tse to a great extent 
thoughts that dozens of writers have used before. 
It does not fall to the lot of many to produce thoughts 
that are new, but old thoughts may be expressed in an 
attractive or forceful way which will always win respectful 
attention. This art of expressing clearly and attractively 
thoughts however old, is in reach of all students who will 
patiently make the effort. 
The purpose of a school course in composition is to train 
the pupil to place his thoughts before other people in such 
a way that they will see them as clearly or feel thern as deeply 
as he himself did. Much practice is necessary for expressing 
well even thoughts that are ordinary; but the practice will, 
in time, develop an ability to express greater thoughts with- 
out conscious effort, and without that leakage and loss of 
power that is characteristic of untutored minds trying to 
transfer thoughts. 
Composition may be oral or written, 
Of the two, oral composition is by far the more useful. 
We probably speak a hundred times as many sentences as 
we write. Every recitation in school, every conversation 
at home, every endeavor of a clerk to sell goods, is oral com- 
position. The accuracy and fulness of a recitation, the
-P-A-G-E-9
10 . PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
pleasure of a conversation, or the satisfaction of a sale of 
goods, evidently will depend upon one’s supply of useful 
thoughts and one’s skill in presenting them. Merely to 
string words so that the listener can snatch a glimpse of a 
thought now and then is no evidence of culture. 
In oral composition the following suggestions should be 
heeded: 
1. Have a good grasp on the thoughts that you are to express 
--whether the exercise is a school recitation, the relating 
of a story, an explanation of some process, etc. If you 
hesitate for lack of thoughts, the language will be lame. 
2. Fix in your mind the order of the thoughts. Jot down 
a few topics, if necessary, until you are able to hold the 
thoughts from slipping away. For example, to tell the story 
of “The Hare and the Tortoise,” think of: (1) the challenge, 
and why made; (2) the challenge accepted; (3) how each 
one ran; (4) the close of the race; (5) what the story teaches. 
3. Avoid the fault shown in Lesson 1. Cut the exercise 
into sentences of proper length. ‘This is the all-important 
item in oral composition, though for a while it will be the 
hardest to accomplish; but the exercise is of small value 
if not correct. 
4. The selection is to be expressed in your own words. 
It will not be composition at all if merely memorized. The 
_words of the book will not be accepted by the teacher. 
Exercise.—Following the above suggestions, relate orally 
Esop’s story of “The Wolf and the Lamb.” Use conversa- 
tion in your exercise. ake not fewer than seven or eight 
sentences. 
LESSON 4.

exactly as printed when the teacher reads it out to you in’ 
the class: 
The cost of living depends largely on where you live. A Russian 
philanthropist travelling in this country told reporters in New York 
that for his breakfast in that city he had some coffee, two eggs, a roll, 
and an orange, and had to pay a dollar for it. In many parts of Switzer- 
land, he said, he could get for a dollar not only a breakfast just as good, 
but a hearty luncheon and an excellent dinner and a room for the night. 
He could do the same in some parts of New York, as well as in Switzer- 
land, if he did but know it, and he would find it possible to live in many 
picturesque and attractive parts of America, in comfortable country 
hotels, for a dollar a day, or seven dollars a week. 
LESSON 5. 
ORAL COMPOSITION. 
Exercise.—Following direc- ss 
tions in Lesson 3, relate orally 
Esop’s story of ‘““The Bundle 
of Sticks.” Use conversa- 
tion, and make at least eight 
sentences of your story.    
GROUP TWO. 
LESSON 6. 
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE—ORDER OF WORDS. 
Observe the order of words in the following sentences: 
1. The children were always clean and happy. 
2. From afar off came a dreary, exquisite music. 
3. Into the court an old neighbor hobbled for water. 
In the first sentence the words are in the natural, or 
normal order—subject first, then predicate. In the second, 
the words are all in the inverted order—predicate first,
-P-A-G-E-11
12 
then. PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
subject. In the third, the subject, an old neighbor, 
is between the two parts of the predicate; but this sentence 
also is in the inverted order. 
In finding the subject and predicate of sentences in inverted 
order, the pupil should first change the sentences to natural 
order—for example: 
2. 
3. A dreamy, exquisite music | came from afar off. 
An old neighbor | hobbled into the court for water. 
Exercise.—Draw a line between the subject and predicate 
of the following sentences, arranging in natural order any 
inverted sentences:

LESSON 7. 
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE—-KINDS OF SENTENCES. 
the preceding lessons, all the sentences have been 
statements, or declarative sentences, since they declare 
facts.
-P-A-G-E-12
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 13 
There are other kinds of sentences, as shown in the follow- 
ing examples: . 
1. How could he ever hope to find it again? 
2. How anxious she would be! 
3. Tell us a story, August. 
In the first example a direct question is asked, the sentence 
being called interrogative. In the second, strong emotion 
is expressed, and the sentence is called exclamatory. In 
the third, a request is made, and the sentence is called imper- 
ative. There may be a strong command or an entreaty in 
the imperative sentence. 
The interrogative sentence is frequently in the inverted 
order. The exclamatory sentence is likewise often inverted. 
The imperative sentence has the subject you understood, 
but is commonly in the natural order. 
* Expressed in the “natural order,” interrogative and exclam- 
atory sentences do not sound idiomatic and familiar; but 
for purposes of analysis they should be so arranged—for 
example: : 
1. He could ever hope to find it again how? 
2. She would be how anxious! 
The declarative sentence is one that states a fact. 
The interrogative sentence is one that asks a direct 
question. 
The exclamatory sentence is one that expresses some sud- 
den or strong emotion. : 
The imperative sentence is one that expresses a request, 
command, or entreaty. 
Remember the punctuation of each kind of sentence. 
Cautions.-1. Remember that the exclamatory sentence 
as a whole expresses strong feeling. Merely an exclamatory 
word or phrase does not make an exclamatory sentence. 
Thus, this sentence, ‘‘Poor little ‘Gilda’! she had-now only
-P-A-G-E-13
14 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
the black iron stove,” is as a whole declarative, though it 
contains an exclamation. 
2. Besides the purely exclamatory sentence, the exclam- 
atory form is often used for sentences that are declarative, 
imperative, or even interrogative—for example: 
Oh, dear Hirschvogel, but for the thought of you I should have 
died! (Exclamatory-declarative.) 
Oh, father, dear father! do hear me, for pity’s sake! (Exclamatory- 
imperative.) 
Oh, dear! what was that shooting pain in my heart! (Exclamatory- 
interrogative.) 
Exercise.—Classify the following sentences as in the above 
lesson, then separate the subject and predicate of each after 
changing the order if necessary: 
. Presently the door opened again sharply. 
Now go away with this gentleman. 
. Who bought the stove from your father? 
Give the florins back to the vile man. 
August! Do you not know me? 
. Quick! There is no time to lose! 
. Then the old man hobbled away to draw his brazen pail full of 
water at the well. 
. Was Hirschvogel going north or south? 
+ 9. Here the Nurnberg stove, with August inside it, was lifted out 
heedfully. 
10. Oh, take care of me, dear Hirschvogel! 
11, Oh! was there one drop of water in it all? 
12. How evidently done over the glaze are his black letters! 
13. Even behind all those wrappings August felt the icy bite of the 
intense cold of the outer air at dawn of a winter's day in

Slavery had other sides than that which was presented in “‘ Uncle

sixty former slaves and their descendants at the home of the aged man 
and his wife who used to own them. It was a joyful reunion, accom- 
panied by a great feast for all and a night of dancing; and the great 
distance many travelled in order to accept the invitation was proof of 
their loyal attachment to the beloved ‘‘ole massa,” and of the happy 
condition of things on that particular plantation, and certainly many 
others, during the war.— Youth's Companion,

when a ship has been more than one: thousand miles from either shore 
. it could be reached only by the assistance of some other ship which was 
within reach, and which used its own wireless outfit to pass along the 
message. That system resulted in many delays and disadvantages, 
and the new arrangement is a long advance in wireless communication. 
It has taken a year to build the stations, for the furious storms which 
often rage in the Azores made it necessary to make the masts, which 
are two hundred and thirty feet tall, particularly strong and massive.

a ship? 
2. In his hand he carried a trident for spearing fish. 
3. Oh, sir, have pity upon a stranger. 
4. He was brave and truthful, gentle and courteous. 
5. Villain and tyrant! You shall die!

10. How shall I cross the seas without a ship? 
Ir. The Gorgon! she will freeze you into stone, 
12. Why will not these immortal sandals prevail, even against the

LESSON 12. 
SIMPLE SUBJECT 4ND ADJECTIVE MODIFIER. 
In the preceding lessons on subject and predicate, the 
complete subject and complete predicate were considered;
-P-A-G-E-16
PRACTICAL ENGLISH WW 
that is, the subject and predicate, including all the words 
and expressions added to make the idea complete. 
The complete subject is the simple subject together with 
its modifiers. 4 
The complete predicate is the simple predicate together 
with its modifiers. 
_It is well from now on to consider the simple subject 
separated from its modifiers. The most common modifier 
of the simple subject is an adjective (or some word used with 
the force of an adjective). 
For example, in this sentence, “A soft, pathetic melody 
stole through the room,” the complete subject is a soft, 
pathetic melody. Of this, melody is the simple subject, 
modified by the adjectives a, soft, and pathetic. 
Exercise.—In each of the following sentences, find the 
- complete subject, then the simple subject and its adjective 
modifiers: . 
. The stout carriers tramped through the city. 
. One little voice piped loud against another’s. 
. The younger children ran joyously to meet him. 
. His great soft eyes flamed alight with furious passion. 
A strange voice called aloud. , 
. The noble old minster looked its grandest and most solemn. 
. A desperate resolve made itself up in his little mind. 
Muffled sounds came to him through the shutters from the 
streets below. 
9. The poor little boy was ‘‘hugged up into nothing.”

LESSON 13. 
PARAGRAPHS. 
In Lessons 4, 9, and ro are found groups of sentences, 
each group discussing a single thought, or topic. . 2 .
-P-A-G-E-17
18 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Such a group of: sentences is called a paragraph. In most 
cases a single paragraph, isolated and complete, does not 
constitute a whole composition, as in the three instances 
referred to above. Usually a number of paragraphs are 
necessary to the developing of a thought, or topic. A chapter 
of a story-book may have dozens of paragraphs; a discussion 
of some question of importance covering a page, a chapter, 
or a volume may have a small or a large number of divisions. 
Moreover, it will be found that sometimes a single sentence 
may constitute a paragraph, since it completely covers some. 
phase of the general subject. Examples will be found in 
later lessons. 
A paragraph is a division of discourse treating of some 
topic or some phase of a general subject. 
The following editorial article from the Youth's Com- 
panion shows the use of paragraphs which contribute to the 
discussion of a subject: ‘ 
INDIA-RUBBER. 
Christopher Columbus, on his second voyage, found the natives of 
the island of Haiti playing with rubber balls, and reported the dis- 
covery of the elastic and resilient substance which since then has been 
adapted to many uses. But it was not till the last century that rubber 
was utilized extensively, when Goodyear, after long years of patient 
and costly experiment, found a way to overcome its stickiness when 
subjected to heat. 
Since then the demand for it has increased steadily and greatly, and 
at the present time the supply is so far short of the demand that com- 
panies are organized to cultivate rubber-trees in all parts of the world, 
. and speculation in the shares of the companies has been the stock- 
market craze of the year in London. 
One-half of the total production of the world is now used for auto- 
mobile tires. As the supply is inadequate, the price has continually 
increased until the best grades of Para rubber sold in London a few 
weeks ago for three dollars a pound. Rubber of poor grades from some 
other districts sells for less than thirty cents a pound. - 
The Amazon district of Brazil is the greatest rubber-producing 
country of the world, for more than half of the total supply comes from

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 19 
there. The Federated Malay States, the Congo region, Portuguese 
West Africa, the east coast of tropical Africa, Rangoon, Penang, Borneo, 
and Mexico, the West Indies and Central America are the other rubber- 
producing districts. About one-tenth of the total yield comes from 
the Congo. 
The rapidly increasing cost of the article has aroused experimenters, 
who have produced substances that have some of the qualities of rubber. 
It is not improbable that they may ultimately succeed, as the chemists 
did in producing artificial indigo, in making real rubber by synthesis. 
Careful reading of each paragraph will show that the 
following. topics are discussed: 
. Early history of rubber. 
. Result of the increased demand for rubber. 
. Increased price of rubber. 
. Where rubber is produced. 
. Attempts to make artificial rubber. APO 
w 
Remember that several sentences may be used i in a single 
paragraph: the rule is, not a paragraph equals a sentence, 
but a topic covers a paragraph (no matter how many sen- 
tences are needed)—as the number of topics, so the number 
of patagraphs. 
In the selection quoted, it will be noticed: 
1. That each paragraph is indented, or begun a little 
distance from the margin. 
2. That all the other lines of the paragraph begins at the 
margin. 
3. That no unusual space is left at the end of any sentence 
of a paragraph except the last one; after this one most of 
the line may be left blank. 
In writing, the same rules should be followed. The indent- 
ing in the first line should allow a full inch from the margin. 
Exercise.—Read carefully the above selection, studying 
each paragraph so that when the teacher places the five 
topics on the blackboard you can write substantially the 
thoughts of the original article.

LESSON 14. 
COMPOSITION BASED ON A PICTURE. 
' The composition on the picture on the opposite page, 
“A Mute Appeal,’’ is not to be a story; the pupil is to tell 
as fully as he can what he sees in the picture. 
The questions below are intended only as a guide. Merely 
to answer them in order would result in a series of scrappy 
sentences, not a well-ordered composition. 
The pupil should make his paragraphs correspond in 
general to the question-groups, following the thought-groups 
- there indicated. 
The composition should then be read through; and if it 
is not well connected and complete, it should be rewritten. 
Suggestions.— What three figures are represented? Which 
is the chief figure?; Why do you think so? Describe the 
dress of the little girl. 
Describe the two dogs by drawing a contrast in detail— 
the breed, size, condition, and expression of each. 
Where is the other end of the cord which encircles the 
poorer dog’s neck? What is the condition of the person 
you think is there? Why do you think so? 
Who or what is making a mute appeal? For himself, or 
for some one else? What is there in his attitude and expres- 
sion that looks like an appeal? What response is the appeal 
meeting with? What is the expression of the little girl as 
she acts—bored, indifferent, contemptuous, or sympathetic? 
What do you think of the picture? Does it incline you 
to'pity those in distress?

London Punch does a service to mankind by printing every week 
several ludicrously ambiguous items culled from the daily press. Itisa 
real service, for inaccurate writing and speaking lead to—if "they do

In this seritence, ‘The cuckoo clock in the corner struck 
eight,” the complete subject is “the cuckoo clock in the 
corner;”’ the simple subject is clock, modified by the adjectives 
the and cuckoo, and also by the expression in the corner, 
which points out which clock is meant. Since in the corner 
is @ group of words consisting of the preposition in and its 
object corner, all used as one modifier, it is called a prepo-

Bishop Talbot, the giant “cowboy bishop,” was once attending a 
meeting of church dignitaries in St. Paul, and one of the clergymen, 
who had been urged by a tramp to give him some money, sent the 
fellow to the bishop. ‘‘He is a very generous man,” said the clergyman, 
“and he might help you.” Everybody's Magazine tells the story. 
The tramp approached Bishop Talbot confidently. The others 
watched with interest. They saw a look of surprise come over the 
tramp’s face. The bishop was talking eagerly. The tramp looked 
troubled. And then, finally, they saw something pass from one hand 
to the other. The tramp tried to slink past the group without speak- 
ing, but one of them called to him: . 
“Well, did you get something from our brother?” 
The tramp grinned sheepishly. ‘‘No,” he admitted, “I gave him a

No infirmity is so common to men of real ability as absent-minded-

who has had to suffer was an eminent ecclesiastic of the English Church, 
Bishop Gott. A writer in Tit-Bits tells the story. 
When he was Dean of Worcester his absent-mindedness gained for 
him among his friends the sobriquet of ‘‘ Dean Forgot.” . 
On one occasion he had invited some friends to dine with him. On 
their arrival, a short. time before the dinner-hour,,he suggested that in 
the interval of waiting, his friends would perhaps like to walk through 
the grounds. After spending about a quarter of an hour in admiring 
the flowers, shrubs and greenhouses, they suddenly came upon a door 
in the garden wall. 
“Ah,” said the dean to his astonished guests, ‘‘this will be a much 
nearer way for you to go home than by going back to the front.” And all 
unconscious of his invitation, he opened the door and bowed them out.

DIRECT OBJECT. 
Examine these sentences: 
1. Into this fence, or fortress, I carried all my provisions, ammuni- 
tion, and stores. 
2. Two hundred florins will keep me out of prison. 
In sentence 1, J is the subject; all the rest is the complete 
predicate. The simple predicate, carried, expresses action. 
I carried what? Provisions, ammunition, stores. The 
action of the verb is directed upon provisions, ammunition, 
and stores. Hence these are called direct objects. 
In sentence 2, me is used as the direct object. 
The direct object names that which receives the action 
of the verb. 
(Note.—When two or more words connected by and, or, 
nor, or but aré used as objects of the same verb, as in sen- 
tence 1, above, they form a compound direct object. 
There may also be in a sentence a compound subject, com= 
pound predicate, compound complement, etc.) 
Exercise 1.—In each sentence, give the complete subject 
and complete predicate; the simple subject with its modifiers; 
the simple predicate with its modifiers; and the direct object:

LESSON 33. 
PARAGRAPHS—THE OUTLINE. 
In Lesson 13 it’ was seen that a composition of several 
paragraphs is carefully built up from topics, one topic being 
the basis for each paragraph. 
Whenever a writer composes any connected story or 
treatise, he begins with his general idea and makes an out- 
line to guide him step by step in setting down the details. 
If he fails to do this, he is likely to wander from the line of 
thought to something else, or to forget thoughts that seemed 
to him very important when they first came into his mind. 
No great writer ever made a book by haphazard; he built 
his outline as carefully as a contractor erects a steel skeleton 
for a tall building before he attempts to work on walls or 
interior. : 
From all the possible topics, the pupil should choose for 
his purpose those that tell the most important facts in regard 
to his subject, and not include any, however attractive, 
that lead him away from his subject. 
Exercise.—Make an outline of three topics, then from 
these write three paragraphs on the subject, “Why Cities 
Should Have Public Parks.”

LESSON 37. | 
SUBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT. 
Study the following sentences: _ 
1. The old man was her graadfather. 
+ 2. The house looked dilapidated and decayed. 
In sentence 1, the verb was does not express action that 
goes over to some direct object. It is completed by the 
noun grandfather, which names the same person as the sub- 
ject, the old man. Since the noun grandfather is used to fill 
up, or complete, the predicate, it is called a complement. — 
Such a complement, belonging to the subject, is called a 
subjective complement. 
In sentence 2, the verb looked is followed by the two 
adjectives dilapidated and decayed. These fill up, or complete, 
the predicate, and express quality or condition of the subject. 
They are adjectives, then, used as subjective complements. 
A subjective complement is a word that completes the 
predicate and belongs to the subject. 
Exercise 1.—In the following sentences, find the complete 
subject; simple subject with its modifiers; complete pred-

what did he say?” 
“Well, my lord, you'll excuse me, but he said, ‘Who’s that old woman 
with the red bed-curtain round her sitting up there?’ ” 
At which the court roared. 
“And what did you say?” asked the judge, looking a little uncom- 
fortable. . 
“T said, ‘Whist, ye spalpeen! That’s the ould boy that’s goin’ to hang yez.’” 
LESSON 39. 
PARAGRAPHS—CONVERSATION.. 
In Lessons 13 and 33, attention was called to the fact that 
paragraphs are developed from certain central ideas, called 
topics, each paragraph representing a certain portion of the 
general subject. This is particularly true of a story or an 
explanatory treatise unfolding some subject. 
In conversation, however, the remarks of the parties are 
made into paragraphs more for convenience and clearness 
than regard to the development of the general subject. 
The selection in Lesson 38 is a good example; others have 
been given in previous lessons. 
  
Exercise.—Copy from some paper, magazine, or book an 
example of conversation properly paragraphed (12 to 20 
lines).

LESSON 41. 
REVIEW: DIRECT OBJECT, SUBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT. 
Study again Lessons 32 and 37. The pupil should get 
clearly in his mind the difference between direct object and 
subjective complement. He should refer to the verbs used 
in Lesson 32 with direct objects and those in Lesson 37 
with complements. 
Not many verbs besides those in Lesson 37 are followed 
by noun or adjective (subjective) complements; but hun- 
dreds may be found that are followed by direct objects. 
Exercise {.—Besides the verbs already used, bring up 
ten others that take direct objects. 
Exercise 2.—In the following sentences, give complete 
subject and predicate; simple subject and predicate; modi- 
fiers of each; and distinguish direct objects from subjective 
complements: 
. The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray. 
. One may question their wit, or wisdom, or beauty. 
They are a square-headed and snake-necked generation. 
I know only two English neighborhoods thoroughly. 
. The villages are straggling, queer old-fashioned places.

OBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT. 
Consider carefully the difference between these two | 
sentences: 
1. Once more he threw his net. 
2. This thought made him most unhappy. _- 
In sentence 1, the verb threw takes the direct object net. 
The statement is complete; the direct object satisfies the 
verb. 
In sentence 2, the verb made is not completed by the word 
him. The verb made is causative: the direct object does 
receive the action of the verb, but the meaning is not com- 
plete until the adjective unhappy is added, which expresses 
the result, or effect, of the action. At the same time, the 
adjective unhappy is a modifier of the direct object. 
Since the word unhappy is a part of the predicate and an 
adjunct of the direct object, it is an objective complement. 
In this sentence, “‘The children called the stove Hirsch- 
vogel,”’ the noun Hirschvogel forms a part of the predicate; 
and as it expresses the result, or effect, of the action, it also 
is an adjunct of the direct object. 
An objective complement is a word that completes the 
predicate and belongs to the direct object. 
The noun used as objective complement indichtes the 
office, position, or title that is bestowed. 
The apJEcTIVE used as objective complement expresses 
condition or quality attained for the direct object. 
Thus much explanation of the objective complement is 
given to help the pupil not to confuse it with the direct 
object, indirect object, and adverbial objective (which last 
two will be explained later).

“YT wonder if you would do me a favor,” said the first one, as he paid 
his bill. The other man seemed receptive, and the first one continued: 
“Have you a lower berth for to-night?” 
The man across the table nodded. 
“Well, I’m travelling with my mother, who is rather well along in 
life, and I’m anxious to make her comfortable. Would you be willing 
to give her your berth?” 
“T should be delighted,” responded the stranger. 
They went back to the sleeper, where the accommodating man was 
presented to the other’s mother, a white-haired old lady with a charm- 
ing face. 
The good Samaritan had exchanged his lower berth for the upper, 
and was radiating with a sense of charitable kindness. It led him to 
remark affably to the other man: 
“But where are you going to sleep?” 
“Oh, that’s all right,” was the answer. ‘That's my lower over

his power of resistance gave way. Weary of admonishing him, the king 
called his son before him, and gave him a vessel of oil so nicely filled 
that the least shock to the vessel would cause it to overflow. He com- 
manded him to carry it through the chief streets of the city and back 
without spilling a drop, ordering at the same time a deaf-mute to accom- 
pany him and cut off his head if he spilled a drop. When he returned, 
the king asked his son what he had seen. 
“Nothing,” was the answer, ‘I was so careful lest the oil should be 
spilled and I should lose my life that I saw neither man nor woman, 
house nor palace.” 
“Learn, my son,” said the king, “that he that fears the justice of 
God for evil-doing will not look upon the things which tempt to sin, 
jest while he looks he errs and is cut off by the justice of God.”

LESSON 46. 
COMPLEMENTS, SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE. 
Exercise.—First give the particular use of each comple- 
ment in the following sentences, and thus determine whether 
it is subjective or objective: 
1. The wind sounded beautiful in Heidi's ears. 
2. She lay perfectly calm and peaceful on her little round arm. 
3. The pleasure of seeing the men’s studies made Tom a ready sub- 
stitute for any lazy boy. 
4. Perhaps the boy will turn out a brave, helpful, truth-telling 
Englishman, and a gentleman. 
A big brutal fellow called the kneeling boy a snivelling young 
shaver. 
6. The men and women of the Bible afterwards became his friends 
and counsellors. 
7. Some of the boys made the old magpie drunk on toast soaked in 
beer and sugar. 
8. The stepmother kept Cinderella quiet with hard tasks. 
9. She stood there a woman of thirty-eight, old enough to be Tom’s

LESSON 47. 
APPOSITION. 
1. Tom set off for White Hall, an old gable-ended house. 
2. They had three children, two daughters and a son, little Arthur. 
3. The angel Death had made a great gap in this circle. 
In sentence 1, White Hall, the object of the preposition 
for, is not readily understood; we do not know whether it 
is a residence, a place of entertainment, or an inn. But 
the added expression, ‘‘an old gable-ended house,” explains 
clearly what is meant. 
In sentence 2, the direct object, children, is explained by 
the nouns daughters and son; and son is explained by Arthur. 
In sentence 3, the subject, angel, is explained by the proper 
noun Death. 
In all such cases, the explanatory noun is said to be an 
explanatory modifier, or to be in apposition with another 
word. . 
A noun in apposition is one joined to another noun as an 
explanatory modifier. 
The appositional term is set off by commas unless closely 
connected, as is the case in sentence 3. 
Exercise—In each of the following sentences, (1) point 
out the complete subject and complete predicate; (2) find 
the word in apposition and tel! what element of the sentence 
it explains—whether subject, object, etc.: 
1. Tom’s mother, Madam Brown, had recently taken this good- 
natured, scatter-brain girl. 
2. His great-uncle, the rector, had encountered and laid this last 
host. 
3. He would rush off with Toby, the turnspit terrier, his faithful 
companion, in close pursuit. 
4. Here they found the farmer, an iron-gray old man, busied in 
one of his vocations, 
5. There was Job Rudkin, son of the widow Rudkin, the mast 
bustling woman in the parish.

new hat. 
They joined the other boys, all small School-house fellows, 
friends of East and Tom. . 
10, Over all is Brooke, wisely and bravely ruling over willing sub- 
jects, a true foot-ball king. 
11. Among the most triumphant of them all is Tom, a School-house 
boy-of two hours’ standing. 
12. At this moment Griffith, the itinerant vender of oranges, enters 
with his heavy baskets. 
13. The street opened into Sally’s kitchen, a low brick-floored room. 
14. Stumps, her husband, a short, easy-going shoemaker, stood in a 
corner of the room. © 
LESSON 48, 
PARAGRAPHING A STORY. 
In the construction of a story, the paragraphs follow each 
other according to the incidents of the story. The outline, 
then, should indicate clearly the working out of the chain 
of events that form the story. 
For example, the following narrative: 
RUBBING DOWN A TIGER. 
It has often been said that a wild beast will not attack a human 
being unless the latter shows signs of fear or the beast is very hungry. 
The following anecdote offers some evidence to support that statement: 
Some years ago the manager of a menagerie in Moscow required an 
extra assistant to clean out cages. The manager, a Frenchman, knew 
no Russian, and the Cossack whom he hired knew no French; but by 
dint of vivid and practical pantomime on the part of the one and ready 
attention on the part of the other, they got on admirably. While 
demonstrating how the work should be done, they came finally to the 
cage of a very tame antelope, which was the pet of all the keepers. 
Rake, broom, sponges and buckets were carried into the cage, and the
-P-A-G-E-45
Ae PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
manager, without any idea of setting an example, but merely as a treat 
for the antelope, brushed and sponged the animal. He then turned the 
instruments over to his new man and went to his office. 
On returning’an hour or so later, he was horrified to discover the 
Cossack inside the cage of a full-grown tiger,—-a splendid, untamed 
brute, récently brought from the jungle, and considered the most dan- 
gerous in the collection,—standing calmly astride the great, striped 
body and vigorously scrubbing its thick fur. 
Transfixed, the manager watched while the powerful body stretched 
itself out at full length on the floor of the cage, the great paws sprawled. 
comfortably, the fierce eyes closed, and the savage throat emitted a 
series of mighty, but whole-souled and grateful purrs. 
The Cossack did his work thoroughly, and when it was completed 
to his entire satisfaction, he gave the beast a good-natured pat on the 
head, gathered up his tools and walked unconcernedly out and locked 
the door. 
Exercise.—Construct an outline of five topics for the 
above five paragraphs. 
LESSON 49. 
COMPOSITION BASED ON A PICTURE. 
_ Suggestions.—The place, whether high or low; how far 
from the water; river, lake, or ocean; why; birds flying; 
objects in distance; water quiet or stormy? 
Chief figures, the dog and the child. Describe the dog: 
is it young or old? What breed? Has it been well treated? 
Does anything indicate an affectionate disposition? Has 
it recently saved the child, or long before? Why? 
Describe the child: boy or girl; size, age, dress. Is it 
dead, or exhausted? Is it the child of poor or well-to-do 
parents?’ Are the positions of the two chief figures natural ? 
How does the picture impress you: does.it arouse ad- 
miration, sympathy, love for the animal or the chila? Why?

GROUP ELEVEN. 
LESSON 51. 
INDIRECT OBJECT, INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS, 
1. Heidi brought the grandmother some rolls. 
2. I will give you a good part of my bread. 
In sentence 1, after the verb brought is the direct object 
rolls: it tells what Heidi brought. Besides this, the word 
grandmother tells for whom she brought the rolls. 
In sentence 2, the word part is the direct object of will 
give: it tells what I will give. The word you tells to whom 
I will give a good part. 
Such words are called indirect objects. (The indirect 
object is a modifier of the simple predicate.) 
An indirect object is a word that indicates the person to 
or for whom, for whose benefit, the action is performed. 
3. Really! Well, do you like to stay in Frankfort? 
4. So you have come home again, Heidi. 
In sentences 3 and 4, the words really, well, and Heidi 
are not actually a part of the sentence-structure. Really 
is an exclamation; well does not modify, but is only intro- 
ductory; Heidi is the name of the person addressed. 
(There is especially common as an introductory word; 
as in the sentence, “There were snow clouds hanging near.” 
By its use the subject is thrown after the verb.)
-P-A-G-E-49
44, PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
All such words are independent elements. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, (1) give the com- 
plete subject and complete predicate; (2) the simple subject 
and simple predicate; (3) direct and indirect object; (4) 
independent elements:

LESSON 52. 
ANALYSIS—REVIEW. 
Thus far, the pupil has examined sentences to find certain 
elements that had been treated in the respective lessons. 
He is now ready to take sentences to pieces and tell the use, 
or function, of every part, and hence to give the name of 
each part from its use. 
This process is called analysis. 
Analysis is the process of separating a sentence into its 
parts according to their use. , 
Summed up, the kinds of sentences are: declarative, 
imperative, interrogative, and exclaniatory. :

4. Simple subject with its modifiers. 
5. Simple predicate with its modifiers. 
6. Direct object, complement, indirect object, etc., with their modi-

tences: 
1. The space under the window was occupied by a square table. 
2. Surely for these things also God will ask an account. . 
3. Poor little Sally, the most good-natured and much enduring of

DICTATION. 
Exercise.—Study the following until you can write it cor- 
rectly in class from your teacher’s dictation: 
LINCOLN’S LAST GOOD-BY. 
The only time that President Lincoln failed to say good-night to me 
when we parted, after having been together for the day, was on the 
evening of the night he attended Ford’s Theatre, where he was murdered. 
As I mentioned on another occasion many years ago, Mr. Lincoln had 
told me that afternoon of a dream that he had had for three consecu- 
tive nights, of his assassination. Of course, the constant dread of such 
an event made me somewhat nervous, and I begged him to stay at the 
Executive Mansion and not to go to the theatre that evening; but he would 
not disappoint Mrs. Lincoln or others who were to be present. Then 
I urged that he allow me to remain on duty and to accompany him; 
but he would not hear of this, either. 
“No, Crook,” he said kindly but firmly; ‘‘you have had a long, hard 
day’s work already, and must go home to sleep and rest. I cannot 
afford to have you get all tired out and exhausted.” 
It was then that he neglected, for the first and only time, to say 
good-night to me. Instead of doing so he turned, with his kind, grave 
face, and said: 
“Good-by, Crook,’”’ and went into his room. 
This was the only time he ever said good-by to me. I thought of it 
at the moment; and a few hours later, when the awful news flashed over 
Washington that he had been shot, his last words were so burned into 
my being that they never have been forgotten, and never can be for- 
gotten. —Saturday Evening Post.

NEW MINISTER'S MISTAKE. 
The Right Rev. Leighton Coleman, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of 
Delaware, spends his vacations on long walking trips through Delaware, 
Maryland and Lower Pennsylvania, says the Baltimore Sun. He meets 
with many amusing adventures on his pilgrimages, and has a vast 
stock of stories about them. 
“One warm summer afternoon a few years ago,” he said recently, 
“the sexton of a quaint old Maryland church showed me through the

cool, dim old building, and as we were departing showed me the big 
Bible and smiled. 
“*A strange thing happened last Sunday in connection with that 
Bible,’ he said. ‘We had a strange minister preaching here, and when 
he opened the book he came upon a notice and read it out with all due 
solemnity. 
“ ‘It was a request for the congregation’s sympathy and prayers for 
John Q. Griggs, who had been deeply afflicted by the loss of his wife.’ 
“The sexton paused and chuckled softly. 
“You see, sir,’ he said, ‘our regular minister had been using that 
paper as a bookmark more than a year, and John Q. Griggs, in a natty 
gray suit, sat in a front pew with the new wife he had taken just the 
week before.’ ”

paragraphs. Be careful to note where they are used and 
where omitted.

BUSINESS LETTERS. 
The parts of a business letter and the proper writing of 
them are shown in the following example:

Dallas, Texas, 
December 8, 1910. 
Harrer & BROTHERS, 
Franklin Square, New York City. 
Dear Sirs: 
Will you please send me particulars in regard to your new edition 
of Mark Twain's works, which you advertise in the November edition

Respectfully, 
Frank L. WILson. 
Notice the following points: 
x. Abbreviations are seldom used in letters. 
4
-P-A-G-E-55
‘50 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
2. The parts of the letter are as follows: 
(a) The Heading, written at the top and to the right. It 
occupies two or three lines, unless very short; then it may 
occupy one line. 
(b) The Inside Address, written at the left margin one 
line lower than the heading. It should have the name of 
the firm or person addressed, street and number (if you 
know these), city or town, and state. (The street and 
number may be omitted from the inside address.) New 
York City, Chicago, and a few other large cities are often 
written without the name of the state. 
(c) The Salutation, written at the left, immediately under 
the address, but at the margin. 
The salutation used in addressing a business man, woman, 
or firm is Dear Sir, Dear Madam, Dear Sirs, or Gentlemen. 
A colon is usually placed after the salutation in a business 
letter. 
(d) The Body of the Letter, the wording of which depends 
on the nature of the letter. 
A business letter should be as brief as possible not to be 
curt or obscure. The sentences should be complete and 
well-worded. Subjects should not be omitted, as in saying, 
“Have received yours of the 18th,” or, ““Will do our best to 
please you,” etc. In such a case the effort to be brisk and 
business-like results in the impression of haste and careless- 
ness. 
(e) The Complimentary Close, written on the next line 
after the body of the letter closes. It begins about the 
middle of the line, so as to leave room for the signature 
below and a little to the right. 
The wording here also varies as does the salutation: for 
example, Respectfully, Yours respectfully, Yours truly, Yours 
very truly, etc. If there are two or three words, only the first 
is written with a capital letter.
-P-A-G-E-56

3. The address on the envelope should be arranged accord- 
ing to this*fixed model: :

Topeka 
Kansas 
Mr. Charles W. Roberts 
926 Peachtree Street, 
Atlanta 
Georgia 
Some abbreviation in the envelope address is allowable; 
but it should be done with care to avoid errors in mailing. 
4. The punctuation of each part of the letter should be 
carefully attended to, as shown in the example above. 
Punctuation at the ends of lines in the address on the envel- 
ope may be omitted. 
Exercise.—Copy the letter at the beginning of this lesson, 
being careful of the arrangement and. punctuation of every 
detail.

GROUP THIRTEEN. 
LESSON 61. 
PARTS OF SPEECH—NOUNS. 
The words in any sentence may be classified according to 
their nature and use. The various classes are called parts 
of speech. 
The parts of speech are usually given as eight in number: 
Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, Verbs, Adverbs, Conjunctions, 
Prepositions, Interjections. 
Note.—Interjections are not strictly parts of speech. 
‘They are only words of emotion—as fear, delight, disgust,

anger, etc., having nothing to do with the.structure of the 
sentence; as, 
“Oh! take me, take me!" he cried. 
Alas! it was not the world which was to end. 
In the following sentence, the italicized words are all 
names: : . 
Whenever Rip Van Winkle went dodging about the village, he was 
surrounded by a troop of children hanging on his skirts, clambering on 
his back, and playing a thousand éricks upon him with impunity. 
One is the name of a particular person; one is the name 
of a group or party; one is the name of a quality; others 
care names of any individual of a class: but all are nouns. 
A noun is a word used as a name. 
Exercise.—Select ail the nouns in the following sentences: 
1. Once upon a time a poor widow lived in a cottage near a wood. 
2. The two little girls were the best children in the world. 
3. Each mornirig in summer, Rose-Red picked fresh flowers to 
place by her mother's bed. 
4. In the evening, when the snow was falling, and the door closed 
and locked, Snow-White and Rose-Red would take seats around 
the fire in the bright little room and knit their stockings, while 
their mother read to them from some good book. 
5. The dwarf was jumping about like a puppy at the end of a 
string. 
6. He picked up his bag of diamonds, and slipped away among the 
rocks. 
7. The servant did not fancy this plan, but being a happy fellow, he 
’ worked for the miser another year. 
8. Quick as a wink, Tom Thumb sprang from the hat, ran through 
the grass, and jumped into the nest of a field-mouse, 
9 The little white bird soon flew down and carried the dress away, 
while Cinderella went home to lie in the ashes.

LESSON 62. 
PRONOUNS. 
In the following sentences, the italicized words are not 
names, but they stand for nouns: 
1. I made a promise that if amyone set me free I would make him 
very rich. 
2. The jar is so small, and you are so vast, that the great toe of one 
of your feet could not be held in it. 
3. Who is this man? It is my husband. 
4. None but Aladdin knew the cause of all the trouble, and he kept 
his secret to himself. 
Some of these words stand for the speaker, some for the 
person spoken to, some for a person mentioned in the sentence; 
some ask a question and stand for the answer; some for an 
- indefinite person or number of persons: but all are pronouns. 
A pronoun is a word used to stand for persons or things 
without naming them. 
Exercise.—Point out the pronouns in the following sen- 
tences, and the word for which each stands: 
1. What do I see? Why, a table spread with plenty to eat and 
drink, and the robbers sitting before it having their supper. 
2. At last the animals carried out their plan. ‘As soon as this was 
done, the donkey gave a signal, and they began to make their 
music. 
3. When the musicians had eaten as much as they could, each went 
to sleep in the spot he liked. 
4. Our four friends liked the place so well that they would not 
leave it, and so far as I know they are there yet. 
5. Snow-White was quiet and gentle. She used to stay at home 
with her mother and help her with the housework. 
Who's there? It’s little Red Riding Hood. 
7, Little Thumb had climbed upon his father’s coat. He spoke so

quality, or tell what kind; in the other sentences, besides 
words of quality, some express number, exact or indefinite, 
and some point out one or more objects: but all are adjectives. 
An adjective is a word that modifies the meaning of some 
noun or pronoun. 
Exercise.—Point out the adjectives in the sentences below, 
and tell what each modifies: 
1. This son, Aladdin, was a very careless, idle, and disobedient 
fellow.

LESSON 67. 
VERBS. 
No sentence can be constructed without a predicate, a 
word that asserts action, being, or condition of some subject. 
Notice the predicates in the following sentences: 
1. The flail was resounding from morning to night; swallows and 
martins skimmed about the eaves. Sleek, unwieldy porkers 
were grunting in their pens. 
2. He was always ready for a fight or a frolic. 
The simple predicate is always a verb, since this is the 
part of the sentence that predicates, or asserts, about the 
subject. 
In some cases the verb is one word; sometimes two, three, 
or even four words together make up one predicate verb. 
A verb is a word used as a predicate, to say something 
about a person or thing.
-P-A-G-E-64
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 87 
Exercise.—Mention the verbs in the sentences below, 
also the simple subject of each: 
. In that village lived Rip Van Winkle, ‘ 
. He was a great favorite among all the good wives. 
. His fences were continually falling to pieces. 
. Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years 
rolled on. 
5. He thought his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again 
when he heard the same cry. 
. Wolf bristled up his back, and skulked to his master’s side, 
7. As Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly 
desisted from their play, and stared at him with such fixed, 
statue-like gaze that his heart turned within him, and his knees 
smote together. 
8. He obeyed with fear and trembling. 
9. He reiterated his visits to the flagon so often that at length his 
senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head

LESSON 71. 
ADVERBS. 
Just as nouns and pronouns are modified by adjectives, 
so verbs have their modifiers. In the following sentences, 
each verb is modified by one or more words: 
1. Soon after, he obtained an order in council to send the king 
away. 
2. The tower was very solidly built. 
3. He was too old to cry; and, perhaps, too proud. 
Analysis of these sentences will show that words telling 
how, when, or where modify verbs: all such are called adverbs. 
But adverbs modify adjectives also, and other adverbs, as 
shown in the above sentences. 
An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective, 
or another adverb. 
Exercise.—Select the adverbs in the following sentences, 
and tell what each modifies: 
1. “He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily. 
2. I have heard now and again of such a thing. 
3. A senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him care- 
fully, and return. 
4. Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop-gate so cunningly 
arranged that he nearly walked into it. 
5. The fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch, and 
Mowgli struck right and left. 
. They left him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward.

10. The hunters made fun of the drivers who were going away, and 
laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and

(If more practice is needed, use Lesson 17.) 
LESSON 72. 
CONJUNCTIONS. 
Many sentences do not consist of a single statement, with 
one subject, one predicate, and one object or complement. 
Usually several statements are joined together, either as 
wholes or condensed into smaller groups, and these groups 
are connected. 
In the following sentences are found words that join state- 
ments or parts of statements: 
1. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the 
clerk, the undertaker, avd the chief mourner. 
2. With great astonishment, and with a strange inexplicable dread, 
he saw the bell begin to swing. 
3. As he threw his head back, his glance happened to rest upon a 
bell, 
4. The house was dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge. 
What words does and connect in sentence 1? What 
phrases in sentence 2? In sentence 3, which statement is 
subordinate, and which is the main statement? They are 
joined by what word? What two equal statements are 
joined by for in sentence 4? 
All these connecting words are conjunctions. 
A conjunction is a word that joins sentences or parts of 
sentences. : 
Remember that conjunctions only join; they do not 
modify, or stand for another word, or show relation between 
words.
-P-A-G-E-67
60 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, point out the 
conjunctions, and tell what words, phrases, or statements 
they join: 
1. The city clocks had just gone three, but it was quite dark already. 
2. The door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open, that he might 
keep his eye upon his clerk. 
Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine. 
Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley? 
. Though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. 
. The heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to 
eight, and regularly up to three. 
. The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he 
heard the noise much louder. 
8. “How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 
9. You never came to my house before that happened. 
10. Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quar- 
ters more. Pape x 
LESSON 73. 
REPRODUCTION. 
After sufficient practice in dictation, a very useful exercise 
is to listen to a selection and reproduce it in substance 
from memory. This is called reproduction, or paraphrase. 
The teacher will read the selection in class at least twice, 
so that the class may thoroughly grasp the thoughts. It 
is not supposed that the exercise has been previously studied 
by the pupils. 
The best method of reproduction is for the class to take 
notes as the teacher reads; and, if possible, to make topics 
for guidance. 
For example, suppose this selection is given: 
AN EXCITING OCCUPATION, 
A Yorkshire nobleman insisted on his head gardener taking on as 
an apprentice a young lad in whom his lordship was interested.
-P-A-G-E-68
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 61 
The lad was very lazy, and the gardener was not at all pleased at 
having such a youth thrust upon him. 
Some time after, his lordship, walking in the garden, came upcn his 
gardener and said: “Well, John, how is my young friend getting on with 
you?” 
“Oh, he’s doin’ fine,” replied the gardener, with a sarcastic grin. 
“'He’s workin’ away there at the very job that suits him.” 
“T’m glad to know that,” said his lordship. ‘What may that be?” 
“Chasing snails off the walks,” was the cutting reply —Tit-Bits. 
As the teacher reads, notes or “catch-words” might be 
jotted down, somewhat as follows: 
“Yorkshire nobleman—liked boy—boy lazy-—gardener did not like 
him—nobleman asks about boy—doing well—good job—what?—chas- 
ing snails.” 
After some practice, the pupil may be able to form a fairly 
good outline during the reading and before reproducing— 
somewhat as follows: 
1. Why the nobleman gave the boy work. 
2. The gardener’s dislike for the boy. 
3. Conversation about the boy: 
(a) Nobleman’s question. - 
(b) Gardener says boy is satisfactory. 
(c) Nobleman asks about boy’s job. 
(d) Gardener's sarcastic reply. 
There should be an effort to write out the story in the 
pupil’s own words; but there is no objection to his using the 
words that are in quotations if he recalls them. The main 
object of the whole exercise is to write correctly what one 
remembers clearly. 
Exercise.—The pupils will write in class a short exercise 
(from the list in the Appendix, p. 142) that can be finished 
in the recitation time remaining after oral discussion of the 
above lesson.

GROUP SIXTEEN. 
LESSON 76. 
PREPOSITIONS. 
In Lessons 22 and 26 were found many phrases modifying 
the subject or predicate. For example: 
(a) Modifying the subject, ‘The hour for shutting the counting- 
house arrive 
(b) Modifying the predicate, ‘‘His nephew left the room without an 
angry word.” 
However, phrases may modify any noun or pronoun in 
the sentence; sometimes adjectives and adverbs also. They 
express the relation of place, time, reason, material, sepa- 
ration, etc. 
Each prepositional phrase is introduced by a preposition, 
which shows the relation between its object and the word 
modified by the phrase. For example, in (a), for shows the
-P-A-G-E-71
64 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
    
       
        relation between shuiting up and hour; in (6), without shows 4 
the relation between word and left. 4 
A preposition is a word that introduces a phrase and. 
shows the relation between its object and the word that the 4 
phrase modifies. 
- Exercise.-Point out the prepositions in the sentences 
below, and find the words between which each shows relatio: 
(Remember to rearrange each sentence if necessary.)

or that part of speech, for many words are used indifferently 4 
as several parts of speech. For example, the word like: i

I never heard the ike (noun). 
Ihave a dollar; you have a like amount—or, 
The picture looks dike a real flower (adjective). 
The soldier stood ike a stone wall (adverb).

LESSON 91. 
CLASSES OF NOUNS. 
The nouns in the following sentences are divided into 
classes according to meaning and use: 
I. We have our great men in America. 
2.. The crew were all asleep, and had neglected to hoist a light. 
3. The sea was lashed into tremendous confusion. 
4. The whistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like 
funeral wailings. 
The word America is the name of a particular place: the 
name is proper, or specially belonging to some one place. 
Hence the word is called a proper noun. 
The words men, light, sea, wind, and rigging, however, 
are names that apply to any one of a class, not to some 
particular one. The names are common to all the individuals 
of a class; hence such words are called common nouns. 
The word crew is the name of a group, or collection. It 
is not common to individuals, but names the group taken 
together. Such words are called collective nouns. 
The word confusion is not the name of an object at all. 
It is the name of a quality or condition of an object, as if 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 71 
such quality or condition could exist separately, or could 
be abstracted from the object. Such words are called abstract 
nouns. . 
(Caution.—The pupil should not suppose that all names 
of things that we cannot see, hear, feel, taste, or smell are 
abstract nouns. Many such are common nouns. Be sure 
that quality or condition in the abstract is expressed if the 
word is called an abstract noun.) 
The words whistling and watlings contain an idea of action. 
They are derived from verbs, but they are only names of 
actions; they are not predicates. Being derived from verbs, 
* they are called verbal nouns. 
A proper noun is a name applied to some particular indi- 
vidual of a class, 
A common noun is a name applied to any individual of 
a class. 
A collective noun is a name applied to a group or collection 
as a whole. . 
An abstract noun is a name of a quality or condition 
considered apart from its object. 
A verbal noun is the name of an action. 
Exercise.—Select the nouns in the following sentences; 
tell what kind of name each is, and to which class of nouns 
it belongs: . 
1. At his knock and call the solid oak door, four centuries old if 
one, flew open, and the boy darted in. 
2. He thought he had heard the wolves behind him at every step, 
and had reached the town in a great state of terror. 
3. Near it stood his father Karl Strehla’s house, with a sculptured 
Bethlehem over the doorway, and the Pilgrimage of the Three 
Kings painted on its wall. : 
4. She was the eldest of the Strehla family. 
5. The stove was of great height and breadth, with all the lustre 
which Hirschvogel learned to give to his enamels when he was 
making love to the Venetian girl whom he afterwards married. 
6. All his childhood had gone out of him.
-P-A-G-E-81
W PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
7. He got over his terror and his sobbing both. 
8. Every time the train stopped and he heard the banging, stamp- 
ing, shouting, and jangling of chains, his heart seemed to jump 
into his mouth. 
- © 9. There had been whole armies of men at work. 
10. He.had heard tthe scratch of the match. 
‘LESSON 92. 
CAPITAL LETTERS. 
The general rule is that proper nouns begin with capital 
letters; -but some special classes of words need comment: 
1. The first word of a direct quotation unless this is only 
a part of a sentence; as, , 
God said, ‘Let there be light.” 
We drag, it is true, “a.lengthening chain” “at each remove of our 
pilgrimage. 
2. Though names of months, and days of the week have 
a capital letter, the names of seasons have not; as, 
The days of March sometimes look more like winter than spring. 
3. The words north, south, east, and-west, and their com- 
pounds northeast, etc., have a capital létter only when they 
refer. to sections of the. country, startling instead of the 
names of a state or states, or part of the world in general; as, 
This railroad runs north and south. 
This railroad carries products from the-great Southwest to the 
markets of the East. 
4. All the important words in the title of a book or essay, 
story, etc., should begin with capital letters; but that fact 
does not require the same words to be capitalized in the 
body of the writing; as, 
A Snowy Day in April ( story). 
But do not write:

titles, such as colonel, captain, principal, president (except 
President of the United States),—all these are capitalized 
if they are used in connection with the proper names them-

I spent a month with Professor Clark and Captain Ferguson on 
Saranac Lake. 
In company with our professor and a captain on his vacation, we

LESSON 97. 
PLURAL OF NOUNS. 
Observe the nouns in the following sentences: 
1. I conveyed a great lump of wax into the boat, with a parcel of 
twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer. 
2. In those savage countries whole nations of negroes were sure to 
surround us with their canoes and destroy us; we should be 
devoured by savage beasts or more merciless savages. 
In sentence 1, every noun is the name of one thing: the 
nouns are of the singular number. 
In sentence 2, every noun is the name of more than one 
thing: the nouns are of the plural number. 
Most of the above singular nouns may be changed to 
plural by the addition of certain endings; all the above 
plural nouns may be made singular by the omission of certain 
endings. 
According to the endings used in becoming plural, the 
above nouns may be grouped as follows: 
Group 1: lump, boat, parcel, thread, hatchet, saw, hammer, 
nation, canoe, beast, savage—all of which simply add s to 
become plural. 
Group 2: country, which changes y to i and adds es to 
become plural. Such is the case when a CONSONANT imme-
-P-A-G-E-85
1% PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
diately precedes the final y; .but if a vowEL precedes the 
final y, as in the word turkey, simply s is added. 
Group 3: negroes, which adds es to the singular to become 
plural. Words ending in o are not alike in this respect, 
however, and each individual word must be noticed. 
' To these groups might be added: 
Group 4: some nouns ending in f or an f sound, such ‘as 
calf, sheaf, knife, etc., change f to v and add s or es to make 
the plural. 
The words of this group also must be noted carefully, 
as some words ending in an f sound add s without other 
change; as roof—roofs. 
Group 5: certain old nouns that form the plural by vowel 
change; as, mouse—mice, foot—feet, goose-—geese, etc. 
Group 6: certain old nouns that add en to form the plural; 
as, ox—oxen, child—children, brother—brethren (in a church, 
fraternity, etc.). 
Group 7: some words that do not change the form to 
denote the plural; as, trout, deer, sheep. 
Number is that inflection by which one thing is indicated, 
or more than one. 
The singular number is the form by which one thing is 
indicated. 
The plural number is the form by which more than one 
thing is indicated. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, point out the sin- 
gular forms and spell the corresponding plural; also point 
out the plural nouns and spell the corresponding singular: 
1. Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, and 
carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, 
and myself. 
2. This forced tears from my eyes again; but as there was little 
relief in that I resolved to get to the ship; so I pulled off my

GENDER OF NOUNS. 
In some languages that the pupil may study later, such 
as Latin, Greek, French, and German, what is called gender
-P-A-G-E-87
78 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
is an elaborate and difficult matter. According to endings 
and classifications, words are said to be of ‘masculine 
gender,” “ feminine gender,” or ‘neuter gender.” 
In English, on the contrary, gender is a very simple 
matter, because the distinction of gender follows that of sex. 
‘Gender ‘is the classification of nouns according to the sex 
of the objects indicated. 
Masculine gender is that form or use of a noun which 
indicates a being of the male sex. 
- Feminine gender is ‘that form or use of a noun which 
indicates a being of the female sex. 
Neuter gender is that form or use of a noun which indicates 
an object without sex. 
In English, there are several ways in which the feminine 
gender-form is derived from the masculine: 
1. By adding ess; as, janitor—janitress. Sometimes, as 
in this word janitress, a letter is dropped before ess is added. 
2. By prefixing he or she, or some other descriptive term,’ 
to a word that is not clear as to sex: as, he-goat—she-goat; 
lawyer—woman-lawyer. 
3. By using entirely different words, since by derivation 
or association the words have come to be used in pairs: 
as, man—woman; buck—doe; ram—ewe. 
(Note.—Many nouns, especially those indicating occupa- 
tions, do not change form to mean male or female, but the 
_ connection in the sentence must show what gender is intended: 
as, stenographer, cashier, teacher; also such words as cousin, 
friend, child, etc.) 
Exercise.—In the following: sentences, give the gender 
of each noun; if masculine or feminine, give the correspond- 
ing form: , 
1. A large, pleasant-looking woman came out of the cottage and 
joined them. 
2. The little girl jumped to her feet and followed the two women.

every morning went down to get the goats. 
5. The child continued her investigations. 
6. The wind passed very softly and gently over the blue-bells and 
the radiant rock-roses. 
7. “Well, general, how are you?” asked the grandfather. 
8. As soon as the miser had crept in among the thorns to pick up 
the bird, the servant took his fiddle and began to play. 
9. A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in 
a little hut on the edge of a great forest. 
10. The youngest brother then married the youngest daughter of the 
king and was made heir of the kingdom. 
11. Like all true scientists, Madam Curie is very modest and unas- 
suming. 
12, Madam Curie is an effective lecturer. 
13. She has been editor of four or five periodicals for children and 
the home. 
14. The patronesses sent pamphlets to friends and acquaintances 
and interviewed gardeners who made a specialty of flowers. 
LESSON 102. 
POSSESSIVE FORMS. 
Notice the use of the italicized forms in these sentences: 
1. On the ground-floor is Peggoty's kitchen. 
2. There was a twitch of Miss Betsey’s head. 
3. We went past boat-builders' yards, shipwrights' yards, smiths’ 
forges, and such places. 
4. It was written over the shop that ladies’ and gentlemen's ward- 
robes were bought. 
In sentence 1, the word Peggoty’s modifies the subject 
kitchen, just as an adjective does. It expresses ownership, 
or possession, hence it is said to be in the possessive case. 
The possessive forms in sentences 1 and 2 are both singu- 
lar: and both add ’s to the simple form to indicate pos- 
session.
-P-A-G-E-89
80 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
In sentence 3, the plural possessive words have only the ~ 
apostrophe added. to indicate possession, because the forms 
already have s as a plural ending. 
In sentence 4, the word gentlemen’s is also plural and 
possessive; but the plural form does not end in s, hence the 
apostrophe and s are added, just as was the casé with singular 
possessive forms. 
Exercise 1.—Write sentences using the singular possessive 
form, then the plural possessive form, of the following nouns: 
sister lady child 
coachman grandfather niece

business firms, etc.; for example: 
Lord. & Taylor's store is in New York City. 
The Pennsylvania Railroad Company's new terminal station in 
New York is one of the greatest buildings in the world. 
In the last sentence quoted, however, it would be better 
to use an equivalent phrase instead of the possessive expres- 
sion; thus, 
The new terminal station of the Pennsyloania Railroad Company in 
New York is, etc. 
It must be remembered that two names do not always 
form one possessive phrase: each noun may be thought of 
as standing for its own separate ownership. In such a case 
the possessive sign is written after each of the words; for 
example: : 
Tam fond of Huyler’s and Lowney’s chocolates. 
Exercise 1.—Write sentences containing the possessive 
singular form of the following words: 
Dr. Gordon Cousin Laura

Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad superintendent 
Exercise 2.—While using in sentences possessive equiva-

possession according to the meaning in each phrase:

LESSON 107. 
CASE OF NOUNS. 
With the exception of the possessive form, nouns do not 
change their form to express various relations to other words 
in the sentence. But in other languages, to be studied later, 
the pupil will find many case forms to mark changes in the 
use of nouns. For this reason some practice is necessary 
in English grammar. 
Case is the change in the form or use-of a noun or pronoun ° 
to express its relations to other words in the sentence. 
The three cases are the nominative, the possessive, and 
the objective. 
As most of the relations which a noun may have to other 
words in the sentence have been studied in the analysis of 
sentences, they need only be summed up here under proper 
heads. 
The nominative case has these uses: 
Subject of a sentence. 
Subjective complement. 
Apposition with the subject or other nominative word. 
Name of person or thing addressed. 
Name used as an exclamation. 
. In a phrase which is absolute, or independent of the 
rest of the sentence; as, “A brisk wind having sprung up, 
we turned the boat toward shore.” 
The objective case has these uses: 
1. Direct object of the verb. 
2. Indirect object of the verb. 
3. Object of a preposition. 
-4. Apposition with the direct object or other nominative 
word. : 
5. A noun expressing time, distance, measmre, or value, 
and used without a preposition or other governing word; 
Seee 
yn
-P-A-G-E-92
PRACTICAL ENGLISH a3 
as, “two hours late,’ “ten feet deep,” “worth five dollars.” 
6. Objective complement. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, first point out the 
use of each noun, then tell whether it is in the nominative 
or the objective case: 
1. Tampa is a military post of the United States. 
2. Robert Gordon, the oldest son, had a great thirst for knowledge. 
3. Harold, some years younger, was of a robust constitution and 
active habit. 
. The next moment the fish was swimming away. 
. Children, I have a proposition to make. 
. The shore was fully seven miles away. 
. Wild turkey and oysters! This is a fine country. 
. Harold, I appoint you master of the hunting department. 
. The packing completed, they pushed from shore. 
. Harold gave Mum the order to “Hie on”; and the dog was soon 
dashing about.

FRIENDLY LETTERS. 
Most of the directions for the arrangement of the parts 
of business letters apply as well to friendly letters. 
Yet there are some differences in wording and general 
style that distinguish friendly letters: 
1. In friendly letters such salutations are used as: My 
dear Sir, My dear Madam, My dear Henry, My dear Mrs. 
Hughes, My dear Miss Owen, My dear Alice, etc. 
2. Letters of friendship have the greatest latitude as to 
length, and as to style of wording. They may have the nature 
of any kind of composition, and are regulated largely by 
considerations of good taste. 
3. The complimentary close of friendly letters may vary 
mauch, according to the relations between the correspondents: 
they range from Yours sincerely, or Yours cordially, to 
Yours affectionately, Yours fondly, Yours devotedly, Your 
loving Mother, Your affectionate Son, etc.
-P-A-G-E-93

2, They took their places, Dr. Gordon at the helm, Robert and 
Harold amidships, Mary and Frank next to their father, and William

In each of these sentences, several particulars are written 
in a series, instead of a new sentence being used for each 
item. 
In sentence 1, all the particulars are objects of the prepo- 
sition of. 
In sentence 2, all the particulars are in apposition with 
the subject they. 
Each of the sentences, then, contains a series of words 
or expressions in the same construction. 
Exercise.—In each of the following sentences, tell what 
words or expressions make up a series in the same construc- 
tion, and tell by analysis what. the construction is: 
1. Mum was a large, ugly, rough-looking cur. 
2. He was brave, faithful, and sagacious.

introductory words, intermediate expressions, series in the 
same construction. 
In writing words in apposition and direct address, commas 
are used to separate them from other parts of the sentence; 
in‘a series of words or expressions in the same construction, 
commas are uséd to separate these items from each other. 
Many examples of these have been studied in Lessons 
6, 47, 51, and 111.

‘CLASSES OF PRONOUNS. 
Observe the: pronouns in these sentences: 
I. F listened with astonishment to the discourse of the fairy, and 
thanked her for the great kindness she had conferred on me. 
“ But, madam,” said I to her, ‘‘ J must entreat you to pardon 
my brothers.” 
2. What could hinder me from being alarmed? 
. Some begged his blessing; others stooped for him to lay his 
hands on. them, which he did, muttering some words in form 
of prayer; in short, he pretended so well that everybody took 
him for the holy woman. 
4. Groping about he reached a staircase, which led down into an 
apartment. 
In sentence 1, the pronouns I, her, me, you, and my have 
different forms to stand for the person speaking (J, me, my), 
the person spoken to (you), and the person spoken of (her); 
hence they are called personal pronouns. 
(Sometimes an old form to represent the person spoken 
to is used—thou, thy, thee, ye, etc. Also, the personal pro- 
nouns often form compounds—himself, ourselves, etc.) 
Remember, they do not always stand for names of persons: 
they get the name personal pronouns from the fact that 
they indicate by their form the speaker (first person), the 
person or thing spoken to (second person), or the person or 
thing spoken of (third person). 
In sentence 2, the word what asks a question, and at the 
same time stands for the answer. The answer probably 
would be, ‘‘ Nothing could hinder me,” or “‘ Scarcely anything 
could hinder me,” etc. Such a word is called an interrogative 
pronoun. 
There are only a few interrogative pronouns—what, which, 
who (with whose and whom). 
In sentence 3, the words some, others, and everybody stand 
for some indefinite number of persons. The words some,
-P-A-G-E-100
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 89 
other, one, any, many, few, several, etc., are often used as 
adjectives; but when they stand for persons or things, they 
are adjective pronouns. 
In this same list are this, these, that, and those, which point 
out; each, either, and neither, each other, and one another, 
which apply to persons or things separately; also any, 
every, some joined with the words one, thing, body, sometimes 
also with the word else; as everyone, anything, somebody 
else, etc. 
In sentence 4, the word which relates to the word stair- 
case which is called its antecedent; it also joins the two divi- 
sions, or clauses, of the sentences just aga conjunction does. 
Such a word is called a relative pronoun. 
The principal relative pronouns are which, that, who (with 
whose and whom), also what, called a “double relative” 
pronoun because it is equivalent to that which. 
A personal pronoun is one that shows by its form whether 
the speaker is meant, or the person or thing spoken to, or 
the person or thing spoken of. 
An interrogative pronoun is one that asks a question. 
An adjective pronoun is a word primarily an adjective, 
used to stand for some indefinite number of persons or things. 
A relative pronoun is one that relates to an antecedent 
and connects clauses. > 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, point out the pro- 
nouns and classify each by determining its use in the sentence: 
1. Their father, the king, married a very wicked Queen, who was 
not kind to the poor children; they found this out on the first 
day. 
2. Elise would whisper to the roses, ‘‘Who is more beautiful than

3. When her father saw Elise he was shocked, and said she could

PERSONAL PRONOUNS. 
The personal pronouns are as follows: 
FIRST PERSON. SECOND PERSON. _ THIRD PERSON. 
Singular. Singular. Singular. 
Nom. I {you) thou he she it 
Pos. my, mite {your, yours) thy, thine his her, hers its 
Obj. me (you) thee him her it.
-P-A-G-E-102
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 91 
Plural, Plural. Plural. 
Nom. we you ye they 
Pos. our, ours your, yours your, yours their, theirs 
Obj. us you you them. 
The forms mine, ours, yours, thine, hers, and theirs are 
sometimes called absolute possessive pronouns because they 
do not stand before the nouns they modify; as, ‘Your hat 
is larger than mine, but I don’t like yours.” 
Connected with this group are the compound personal 
pronouns, which consist of the word self (plural, selves) 
added to certain of the simple forms. The list is as follows: 
myself, ourselves; yourself, thyself, yourselves; himself, her- 
self, itself, themselves. 
These are used as modifiers of the subject, as, “I saw him 
myself”; or reflexively, being objects of verbs or prepositions 
and at the same time referring back to the subject, as, 
“The prisoner drew himself back quickly.” 
The forms you, your, yours are used commonly in place 
of a singular pronoun of the second person; but they al- 
ways have a plural predicate. 
Exercise.—Classify the pronouns in the following sentences 
as simple, absolute, or compound personal; also give the 
number, gender, person and case of each: 
1. I suppose that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that they 
were not really so very good as I then believed them to be. 
2. Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and 
expected the same services from me as he would from another. 
3. We dropped anchor and swung out our cable toward the shore. 
4. Thad rendered this lady some little services, which had probably 
impressed her with sentiments of good-will toward me. 
5. “Among the printers here,” said he, ‘‘you will improve yourself, 
and when you return to America you will set up to better ad- 
vantage.” 
6. I have made a cake for you, and before I taste of yours, I desire 
you will eat a piece of mine.

LESSON 122. 
NOMINATIVE AND OBJECTIVE FORMS. 
As noticed in the preceding lesson, the nominative forms 
of the personal pronouns are: I, we, thou, ye, he, she, they. 
The objective forms are: me, us, thee, him, and them. 
Some of them, as you, her, it, may be used in more than 
one case. 
The proper use of the distinctively nominative and the 
distinctively objective forms, however, is very important; 
for no person pretending to be educated can afford to confuse 
these. 
Before using any of these words in a sentence, the writer 
or speaker should pause and think in advance what the con- 
struction is, and what particular form is therefore required. 
In the exercise below, let the same method be very carefully 
followed. 
Exercise.—In each of the following sentences, determine 
the use of each pronoun by analysis, then make choice of the 
proper form: 
1. These two boys and (I, me) are brothers. 
2. Uncle Henry told my brother and (I, me) to bring the packages 
home. 
. Sarah and (we, us) will meet you at the station this evening. 
I was anxious to go with the class but could not because Sarah 
and (they, them) were late.

LESSON 123. 
MAKING THE OUTLINE. 
In many of the previous lessons, emphasis has been placed 
on the making of an outline before the writing of any com- 
position. In Lessons 3 and 13 the matter was touched upon; 
in Lesson 33 more detailed instruction was given; and once 
more, in Lesson 73, an outline was advised in ‘the writing 
of reproduction, or paraphrase. 
But the matter is sufficiently important to occupy the 
pupil further, in order that he may fully appreciate the value 
of the exercise. ; 
In order to properly outline any subject, the writer must 
think downward : he must look all the way along his subject 
so as to develop all the details and phases of it. 
The outline must elaborate the subject, not something else 
that the mind stumbles upon in its search among details. 
A good outline is like a river system—it includes many 
tributaries, but one must not leave the main stream in order 
to wander among attractive scenes of the less useful branches. 
The two leading objects in constructing an outline are 
the following: (1) to spread out the material into its many 
parts or features, so that the writer may know what he can 
use; (2) to guide the writer in the order of treatment, so that 
he may use the material to the best advantage. 
Without an outline, not only may the writer wander from 
his subject, but many really useful thoughts may slip away 
from him and be lost because they were not kept in place and 
ready for use. 
Examples of outlines (pupils’ work): 
BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST. 
1. The feast. 
2. The writing on the wall. 
3. The interpretation. 
Does this complete the story?

What topic is needed between 1 and 2? 
THE SWORD OF SIEGFRIED. 
1. Siegfried’s apprenticeship to Mime. 
2. The challenge. 
3. The sword. 
How should the last topic be changed so as to include an interesting 
portion of the story? . 
RALEIGH AND THE QUEEN. 
1. Walter Raleigh— 
Who he was. 
His character. 
Personal appearance. 
2. Helping the Queen—

Appearance of Queen and escort. 
. Throwing down the cloak. 
The Queen's inquiries of Raleigh. 
3. His reward—

Is this outline satisfactory to you? 
Exercise 1.—Write out, just as they occur to your mind, 
five to ten topics on the subject, ‘‘How Politeness May Be 
Cultivated in School.” 
Exercise 2.—Examine these topics to see whether any are 
repeated, whether any are off the subject, and whether you 
have used the best available topics; then rearrange your 
best topics into as good an outline as you can.

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 95 
LESSON. 124. 
MAKING THE OUTLINE. 
Sometimes the outline lacks definiteness. The writer may 
have an idea of what he himself would say upon each of the 
topics that he makes, but what could some one else say on 
them? A good rule is, that the topics should themselves 
suggest—briefly but clearly—what ts to be written in expanding 
them; so that if some one else should be required to use them 
the outline would be a really useful guide. 
Examine the following outline: 
JASON AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE. 
1, Jason—-Chiron—playmates. 
2. Jason’s purpose—Greek heroes—the ship. 
3. Colchis—Medea. 
4. Dangers endured to get the fleece. 
Are all the topics clear? Are they suggestive? Could you write 
from them a composition of four paragraphs that would tell the story? 
Exercise 1.—-Compare these sets of outlines: 
THE FIERY FURNACE.

GROUP TWENTY-SIX. 
LESSON 126. 
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS. 
The interrogative pronouns are what, which, and who. 
What and which are used in both nominative and objective 
case, singular and plural; they have no possessive case. 
Who has the possessive form whose and the objective form 
whom, singular and plural. 
As already seen, these pronouns are used to ask a question. 
In a question the words are frequently in inverted order; 
as, “What wouldst thou have?” And in order to find out 
the relation of what to other words in the sentence and thus 
determine its case, it is well to change the sentence into the 
normal order, ‘Thou wouldst have what?” 
By analysis, the word what is here found to be the direct 
object of the verb wouldst have, hence it is in the objective 
case. 
So far, all the questions considered have been direct ques- 
tions, in which the question forms a complete clause, followed 
by an interrogation point. 
Very often, however, indirect questions are used. These 
are made subordinate to some such word as asked, inquired, 
wondered, desired to know, found out, discovered, learned, etc.; 
7

they do not begin with’ a capital letter, have no quotation 
marks, nor are they. followed by the interrogation point; 
for example, 
The Hindu asked the emperor whither he wished him to go. 
Interrogative pronouns often introduce indirect questions, 
and their case is determined just as if they were direct 
questions; as, : 
The sultan demanded whe the Hindu was. 
Here Hindu is the subject of the subordinate clause, 
was is the predicate, and who is the subjective complement. 
Who is used to apply to persons, what to things. Which 
may apply to persons or things, but usually is selective; as 
if one knew in a general way, but questioned about one in 
a group. ‘ 
Exercise.—Point out the direct and the indirect questions 
in the following sentences; mention the interrogative pro- 
nouns, and by analysis tell the office and hence the case of each: 
1. They found out what their sister was doing for their sakes. 
2. What did she not suffer in her heart for her brothers? 
3. The king himself at last stepped out and asked what was the 
matter. . 
4. At the entrance of the wood stood a chapel or convent, but she 
could not be sure which it was. 
5. “Which of the trees shall I cut down?” said the woodman. 
6. But whose house had they found, and whom might they find 
inside? 
7. We know who has soup and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, 
who has cutlets and who has eggs. 
8. The prince asked who she was, and how she had got there. 
LESSON 127. 
ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS. 
The adjective pronouns that will be of most use-to the 
pupil in his later studies are:
-P-A-G-E-110
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 99 
1. The demonstrative pronouns this, that and their plurals 
these, those. : 
This and these are used to point out things near in space 
or time; that and those, ta point out things that are distant. 
2. The indefinite pronouns, referring to an indefinite person 
or thing or number of persons or things. 
Such are many, few, all, any, some, few; each other, one 
another; each, either, neither; anyone, anybody, anything, 
somebody, somebody else (possessive somebody else’s), etc. 
The indefinite one has a possessive singular form and is 
even used in the plural; as, “One might exchange one’s 
silver spoons for some plated ones.” . 
The case of any adjective pronoun must be determined 
by the analysis of the sentence. Remember that these words 
do not modify, unless in the possessive case: they should not 
be confused with adjectives. 
Exercise.—Point out the adjective pronouns in the follow- 
ing sentences, and determine by analysis the case of each: 
1. For pickling and preserving, none could excel her. 
2. Nothing could make us angry with the world or each other. 
3. “That,” cried he, pointing to a magnificent house, ‘belongs to 
Mr. Thornhill.” 
4. Confute me in argument! I believe there are but few who can 
do that. _ 
5. Such as are poor and will associate with none but the rich, 
are hated by those they avoid and despised by those they 
follow. 
6. He asked me if I had seen the last Monitor or the last Auditor. 
“J have seen neither,” I replied. 
7. The people of Paris are fonder of strangers that have money than 
those that have wit. As I could not boast much of either, I 
was no great favorite.

LESSON 128. 
KEEPING TO THE SUBJECT. 
The young writer may, in his outline, step aside from the 
direct line of thought; or sometimes after a correct outline is - 
made he is drawn aside by some thought, which, though 
interesting to him, is entirely ‘“‘off the subject.” 
The experience is like that related by Eliza Calvert Hall 
in a recent number of the Cosmopolitan: 
“What was I talkin’ about a while ago, child?” she asked helplessly. 
“Wasn't it circuses?” I suggested. 
The cloud of perplexity rolled away from Aunt Jane’s face. ‘Why, 
of course it was,”’ she ejaculated with an accent of self-reproof for her 
forgetfulness. “Didn't I start out to tell you about Parson Page goin’ 
to the circus, and here I am tellin’ about the earthquake. I’m jist like 
an old blind horse; can’t keep in the straight road to save my life. Some 
folks might say my mind was failin’, but if you ever git to be as old as I 
am, child, you'll know jist how it is. A young person hasn't got much 
to remember, and he can start out and tell a straight tale without any 
trouble. But an old woman like me—why, every name I hear starts 
up some recollection or other, and that keeps me goin’ first to one side 
of the road and then to the other.” 
‘The remedy for this lies (z) in close concentration of 
thought while writing, and (2) in much practice in writing 
until the mind is under firm control. 
Close akin to the above fault is the lack of proportion 
caused by too much attention—that is, too many topics and 
too much space—upon topics that should be merely intro- 
ductory or incidental. 
Exercise 1.—Compare the following outlines as to pro- 
portion and keeping to the subject:

2. Elijah addresses the people on Mt. Carmel. 
3. Calling on Baal. 
4. Power of God. 
Exercise 3.—In the following composition, written by a 
pupil, is the development of the outline satisfactory to you? 
PRESERVATION OF FORESTS, 
1. To preserve the soil of mountain regions. 
2. To control the water supply. 
3. To add to the amount of rainfall. 
“He who plants a tree plants hope, joy, peace, youth, and love.” 
Many, many years ago, before our country was settled by the Pil- 
grims, the country was a vast forest.’ The country was then inhabited 
by Indians, who lived in these forests; therefore the trees were unmo- 
lested by this race. But as soon as the English came to America they 
began to clear places for room to build cabins. They cut down the 
trees, justifying themselves by thinking that the next generation would 
not need the trees, as they would have coal for fuel. They did not 
_know or think about the important facts that trees preserve the soil 
of mountainous regions, control the water power, and add to the amount 
of rainfall. 
Some will say, ‘‘ How can trees preserve the soil, control water power, 
and add to the amount of rainfall?” The trees when growing in forests, 
generally grow in great numbers, and when the roots are all together it 
holds the soil and keeps it from being washed down the mountain side. 
Generally where there are lots of trees, rainfall and water power are
-P-A-G-E-113
102 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
greater. We know that on barren plains and on deserts there are no 
trees, consequently there is little rainfall. 
We should preserve forests, because wood is one of our most impor- 
tant necessities. When we think of the useful articles (in fact some that 
we cotld not do without) that are made of wood, we think that laws to 
the effect of preserving forests should be executed. Most furniture is 
made of wood; pencils, pens, and thousands of other useful articles are 
made of wood. The water supply produced by the presence of trees 
(mostly) is something necessary to life. Water power runs machinery 
with which grinding and such is done. 
Generally where forests are thickest it is wet and swampy. But it 
causes a sufficient amount of rainfall, and this is necessary to life. The 
rainfall causes plant life, to say nothing of the life of man and animals. 
Were it not for rainfall, plant life could not thrive, and without plant 
life, man could not. live; so trees and forests should be preserved.

GROUP TWENTY-SEVEN. 
LESSON 131. 
USE OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS. 
As seen in Lesson 117, the relative pronoun relates to a 
preceding word, the antecedent, and connects its clause with 
that in which the antecedent stands. 
The relative pronoun is useful in standing for the ante- 
cedent instead of allowing the antecedent to be repeated; 
for example, it is better to write, ‘There were chosen for him 
four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, who each had 
to give him a name”’ than to write—‘There were chosen for 
him four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers. The god- 
fathers and godmothers each had to give him a name.”’ 
Of course, we might put they instead of “the godfathers 
and godmothers,” but it is much better to combine all into 
one statement. - 
Exercise 1.—Combine the following sets of statements 
into sentences having relative pronouns (that, which, who, 
whose, whom): 
1. A troop of little girls carried baskets of flowers. They strewed 
- the flowers all the way before nurse and child.

2. Her soft gray eyes were fixed on the prince. He seemed to 
answer to the look. 
3. Everybody was satisfied except, perhaps, the little prince him- 
self. The prince moaned faintly under his christening robes. 
The robes nearly smothered him. 
4. His nurse stumbled and let him fall. It was the nurse's duty to 
carry him to and from the chapel. 
5. There was seen among the group of children somebody—not a 
child—yet no bigger than a child. Nobody had seen her before. 
She certainly had not been invited. 
6. The great bell of the palace began to toll. The bell was heard 
only on the death of some of the royal family. 
7. You could perceive some slits in the wall of the tower. Through 
the slits one might possibly creep in or look out. 
8. He mounted to the top of the tower, and slung from it a sort 
of chair. The woman and child placed themselves in the chair 
and were drawn up. 
Exercise 2.—Point out the antecedent of each relative 
_ pronoun in the sentences that you made in Exercise r. 
LESSON 132. 
ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SENTENCES. 
Such sentences as those written in the exercises of Lesson 
131 may now be analyzed; for example, 
“You could perceive some slits in the wall, through which 
one might possibly creep in or look out.”’ 
The sentence consists of two parts, each having a subject 
and its predicate. One of these, ““You could perceive some 
slits in the wall,” is the principal statement; it would make 
complete sense if the other part were left out. 
The other division of the sentence, “through which one 
might possibly creep in or look out,” is subordinate, or de- 
pendent, because it could not stand without the principal 
statement. 
These two parts‘are called clauses. The part making com-
-P-A-G-E-116
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 105 
plete sense by itself is called the principal, or independent, 
clause. The part that depends on the other and does not 
make complete sense by itself, is called the subordinate, or 
dependent, clause. 
Such a sentence is called a complex sentence. 
A complex sentence is a sentence having one independent 
clause and one or more dependent clauses. 
A clause is a division of a sentence having a subject and 
its predicate. 
An independent clause is one that makes complete sense 
when standing alone. 
A dependent clause is one that does not make complete 
sense, but depends upon some word in the independent 
clause. 
Analyze complex sentences as follows: 
(1) Separate the independent and dependent clauses; 
(2) Give the office, or use, of the dependent clause’ 
(3) Analyze each clause like a simple sentence. 
For example, in the sentence quoted above, the independ- 
ent clause is, ‘‘You could perceive some slits in the wall’; 
the dependent clause, which is used like an adjective to 
modify shits, is “through which one might possibly creep 
in or look out.” 
Of the independent clause, you is the complete and simple 
subject, could perceive some slits in the wall is the complete 
predicate; could perceive is the simple predicate; slits is the 
simple direct object, modified by some; the phrase in the wall 
may be taken to modify the predicate or the object. 
Of the dependent clause, one is the complete and simple 
subject; might possibly creep in or look out through which is 
the complete predicate; might creep or look is the compound 
predicate, modified by the phrase through which; might 
creep is modified by the adverb ix, and might look is modified 
by the adverb out.

3. Inside, it was furnished with lots of books and toys, and every- 
thing that the heart of a child could desire. 
4. He was only a little gentle boy, with a sweet sleepy smile and

5. It might be something belonging to her—his dear, kind god-

Narration is the process of relating a story. 
Exposition is the process of unfolding the thoughts and 
opinions of the writer. 
A description is usually short—from one to two para- 
graphs—and is often used in connection with narration or 
exposition. Especially does it help the reader to keep before. 
his mind persons and places that play a part in a story. 
In order to describe anything well, the writer should 
regard the following requisites: 
1. Close observation. No one can describe a building well 
until that building stands out before him distinct in all 
details, and different from all other edifices in the world. 
Nor is a person well described unless his peculiarities are so 
clear that he cannot possibly be mistaken for any one else. 
Close observation, then, not 
only notes details, but takes 
note of those details that dis- 
tinguish one object or person 
from all others. 
2. Selection of distinctive de- 
tails. It would not be worth 
while to describe a pine tree if 
the description would fit every 
pine tree. But if the tree is 
in a noticeable situation, if it 
is remarkably lofty. and well 
proportioned, or if it is stunted, gnarled, and twisted so as 
to remind one of a wrecked and wayward life,—then a de- 
scription may leave a distinct impression. So in describing 
a person, a mere catalogue of features would be of no value: 
some peculiarity of gait, feature, or expression must be 
chosen and given skilful attention by the writer. 
3. Omission of unimportant details. This is implied in 
the above paragraph, but is noteworthy enough to require 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
108 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
restatement. To say that a tree has trunk, limbs and leaves, 
or that it is very tall and straight; to say that a house has 
mariy windows, a strong roof, and is neatly painted; or to 
say that a girl has brown hair, blue eyes, straight nose, 
well-formed mouth and soft cheeks,—none of this has any 
value in making an impression on the reader. 
Now the chief value of any description is to so impress 
the reader as to create in his mind the mood, or feeling that is 
in the writer’s mind. If we wish the reader to feel that a 
person is coquettish, or merry-hearted, or quick to anger, or 
melancholy, or full of curiosity, we should so select and 
arrange details as to leave the reader no choice but to receive 
the very impression selected. 
The description may not be of form and features alone, 
but may be partly or mainly description of the person’s 
actions, or even of the actions of others in regard to him or 
her. 
Remember, the writer does not start out by saying, 
“This person was quick to anger”: instead, he chooses and 
arranges those detatis of the picture which, as a whole, convey 
the idea. 
The following quotations from Dickens are examples of 
description which aim to create certain moods, or impres- 
sions: 
1. It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking 
lady she was; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in 
face and voice, and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over 
her large nose, as if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wear- 
ing whiskers, she had carried them to that account. She brought with 
her two uncompromising hard black boxes, with her initials on the lid 
inhard brass nails. When she paid the coachman she took her money 
out of a hard steel purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag 
which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite.. 
T had never, at that time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss 
Murdstone was. 
2. I went in, and found there a stoutish, middle-aged person, in a

brown surtout and black tights and shoes, with no more hair upon his 
head (which was a large one, and very shining) than there is upon an 
egg, and with a very extensive face, which he turned full upon me. 
His clothes were shabby, but he had an imposing shirt-collar on. He 
carried a jaunty sort of stick, with a large pair of rusty tassels to it; 
and a quizzing-glass hung outside his coat—for ornament, I afterwards 
found, as he very seldom looked through it, and couldn’t see anything 
when he did. 
3. Nobody ever stopped him on the street to say, with gladsome 
looks, ‘“My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” 
No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what 
it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the 
way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs 
appeared to know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug 
their owners into doorways and up. courts; and then would wag their 
tails as though they said, ‘No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark 
master.”” 
4. They left the high road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon 
approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock sur- 
mounted cupola on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large 
house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little 
used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and 
their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables, and the 
coach-houses and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more 
retentive of its ancient state within; for entering the dreary hall, and 
glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them 
poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savor in the air, 
a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with 
too much getting up by candlelight, and not too much to eat. 
Exercise 1.—Often in a description, a general idea of 
shape, size or character is given at the first of a description 
and summed up at the end. Do you find an instance of this 
in the above selections? 
Exercise 2.—What impression does the writer intend to 
make in each of the above selections?

LESSON 136. 
RELATIVE PRONOUN AND ANTECEDENT. 
The relation between the relative pronoun and its ante- 
cedent is an important topic to study for two reasons: (1) in 
writing English, errors are likely to be made if this relation 
is not understood, especially when the relative is subject of 
averb; (2) in later study, especially of Latin, Greek, and 
German, the form of the relative pronoun is found to change 
according to the form of the antecedent, and the correct 
form of the pronoun cannot be found unless the student 
knows accurately its relation to its antecedent. 
For example, consider this sentence: . 
“He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a 
white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to his 
ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched 
woman with an infant, whom he saw below, wpon a doorstep.” 
By dividing this sentence into three, if necessary, we find 
that the antecedent of who is ghost, and the antecedent of 
whom is woman. Now the word ghost is of masculine gender, 
third person, singular number. The relative pronoun is 
said to agree with its antecedent in gender, person, and 
number; hence who is of masculine gender, third person, 
singular number. 
Again, since the antecedent woman isof feminine gender, 
third person, singular number, the relative pronoun whom 
is also of feminine gender, third person, singular number.
-P-A-G-E-124
PRACTICAL ENGLISH mM 
The relative pronoun what is different, since it has no 
antecedent expressed. Usually it is considered equivalent 
to that which or those which; that or those being regarded:as 
the antecedent and which as the relative pronoun. For 
example, ‘It was nothing but what most of you children see 
every day”; expanded, “It was nothing but that which most 
of you children see every day.” 
Exercise 1.—In the following sentences, determine the 
gender, person, and number of the antecedent, then of each 
relative pronoun: 
I. 
. He gazed upon the grass, every square foot of which was a mine yb There were the flowers that grew on the plain. 
of wonders. 
. Just to rest his eyes, he turned them up to the sky—the blue, 
bright, empty sky, which he had looked at so often and in 
which he had seen nothing. 
. “They must be the passage-birds flying seawards!'’ cried the 
boy, who had read a little about them. 
» It was I who gave you your name, and you will belong to me all 
your days. 
. There were evidently some things which his godmother either 
could not or would not give. 
. She had gradually got used to the little lame prince, whom at 
first she had hated. 
. I think thousands of subjects might have been found who were 
almost ready to die for their poor lame king. 
. This was said to a good old woman—his first homely nurse— 
whom he had sought for far and wide. 
LESSON 187. 
CASE OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS. 
One of the most widespread errors among students of 
grammar is their statement that “Relative pronouns agree 
with their antecedents in gender, number, person, and case.”” 
There is no relation, no connection whatever between the 
case of the antecedent and the case of the relative pronoun.
-P-A-G-E-125
112 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
The case of the relative pronoun is determined just like 
that of any other pronoun or of any noun—by the use of the 
word in its own clause. For example, in the sentence,‘‘It was 
the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him quickly,” 
the antecedent is the object of the preposition of, hence 
objective case; who is the subject of the verb came, hence 
nominative case. 
Exercise.—Determine the use, and consequently the case, 
of each relative pronoun in the exercises in Lessons 132 
and 136. 
LESSON 138. 
PARAPHRASING POETRY. 
‘The previous practice in paraphrase, or reproduction, of 
prose should make easier the task of paraphrasing poetry. 
Poetry, however, offers some difficulty on account of its 
peculiarities, which are: (1) its meter, or regular measure of 
syllables; (2) its frequent inverted order, more common 
and more marked than in prose; (3) its rhyme. 
Rhyme is not indispensable to poetry, but most of the 
poetry read in the schools has rhyme; for example, in the 
poem below, the rhymes are sunning—running; official— 
initial; betraying—playing; etc. 
Examples of inverted order in the poem are: ‘Still sits 
the school-house by the road’; “Around it still the sumachs 
. grow”; “Deep scarred by raps official”; etc. 
In order to reduce the poetry to prose, the poetical peculiar- 
ities mentioned above must be removed; and then the 
wording in general should be changed as far as possible to 
the pupil’s own words. 
For successful paraphrasing of poetry, the following sug- 
gestions are useful: 
1. Read the poem over until you thoroughly understand the story. 
2. Make an outline from memory of the leading topics of the poem.
-P-A-G-E-126
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 113 
3. Again referring to the poem, correct and complete your outline. 
4. Write the story from your outline without referring further to the 
poem. 
5. If you find in re-reading your paraphrase that you have used 
any meter, noticeable inversions, or rhyme, alter these parts to 
conform to original, natural prose. 
As an exercise in paraphrasing poetry, take the following 
poem of Whittier’s: 
. IN SCHOOL-DAYS. 
Still sits the school-house by the road, 
A ragged beggar sunning; 
Around it still the sumachs grow, 
And blackberry-vines are running. 
Within, the master’s desk is seen, 
Deep scarred by raps official; 
The warping floor, the battered seats, 
The jack-knife’s carved initial; 
The charcoal frescoes on its wall; 
Its door's worn sill, betraying 
The feet that, creeping slow to school, 
Went storming out to playing! 
Long years ago a winter sun 
Shone over it at setting; 
Lit up its western window-panes, 
And low eaves’ icy fretting. 
It touched the tangled golden curls, 
And brown eyes full of grieving, 
Of one who still her steps delayed 
When all the school were leaving. 
For near her stood the little boy 
Her childish favor singled: 
His cap pulled low upon his face 
Where pride and shame were mingled.
-P-A-G-E-127
4 PRACTICAL. ENGLISH 
Pushing with restless feet the snow 
To right and left, he lingered ;— 
As restlessly her tiny hands 
The blue-checked apron fingered. 
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt 
The soft hand's light caressing, 
And heard the tremble of her voice, 
As if a fault confessing. 
“I’m sorry that I spelt the word: 
I hate to go above you, 
Because,’’—the brown eyes lower fell,— 
“Because, you see, I love you!” 
After the reading, an outline might be made as follows: 
1. Description of the school-house as it now is (stanzas r, 2, 3). 
2. A story of the school-house long ago. 
(a) A winter’s sunset. 
(b) The girl who lingered. 
(c) The boy—why he hung his head. 
(d) Her touch, and her words of regret and sympathy. 
From this outline, a story somewhat as follows might be 
written: 
The little school-house may still be seen nestling beside the road, 
surrounded by a tangle of vines, and looking like a beggar in his rags 
who loves to bask in the sun. Looking within the school-room, one 
may see the master’s desk, scarred with hard raps of the ruler; the 
ancient desks of the pupils, battered and carved by jack-knives; the 
wall,. scrawled over with charcoal; and the door-sill, worn smooth and 
thin by the hundreds of little feet that have sauntered in to study or 
stormed out to play. 
Late one winter afternoon, in the long ago, when the last rays of the 
sun were lighting up the ice-hung eaves of the old school-house, two 
small figures were seen lingering in its shadow, as if, for some reason,, 
loth to start homeward. One was a little girl with tangled golden hair 
and earnest, tender brown eyes. She was fingering her apron and 
glancing shyly at the little boy opposite, who evidentiy was a favored
-P-A-G-E-128
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 115 
playmate. As the little fellow, with his cap pulled down over his eyes, 
was pushing the snow about with his toes, he suddenly felt the soft 
touch of the little girl’s hand upon his arm, as if to comfort him in some 
childish trouble. 
“You know,” she faltered, “I didn’t want to spell’ the word. I did 
hate to turn you down, because I’’—and her serious brown eyes were 
lowered—"‘ you see, I love you!’ 
(Note.—The work of paraphrasing poetry into prose is 
not altogether an elevating task, since it changes an artistic 
form to one that is at best less artistic; but the fact that 
many pupils have difficulty in ‘seeing what poetry means” 
is good reason for this exercise.) 
Exercise.—After studying the above poem, be prepared 
to tell it in your own words in class. 
LESSON 139. 
PARAPHRASING POETRY.

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!) 
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, 
And saw, within the moonlight in his room, 
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, 
An angel writing in a book of gold:— 
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, 
And to the presence in his room he said, 
“What writest thou?” The vision raised its head, 
And with a look made of all sweet accord, 
Answer’d, ‘The names of those who love the Lord.” 
“And is mine one?” said Abou. ‘Nay, not so,” 
Replied the angel. Abou spake more low, 
But cheerily still; and said, “I pray thee, then, 
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.”” 
The angel wrote, and vanish’d. The next night 
It came again with a great wakening light, 
And showed the names of those whom love of God had bless’d; 
And jo! Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest. ‘

SYNTAX OF PRONOUNS. 
Besides the misuse of nominative and objective forms 
spoken of in Lesson 122, there are some other matters of 
syntax that require special attention.
-P-A-G-E-130
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 17 
Syntax is that department of grammar which treats of the 
proper forms and relations of words in the sentence. 
Personal pronouns.—Perhaps the most common errors 
of young writers in the use of personal pronouns are these: 
1. Use of zt or they without an antecedent: 
We went to a room where they make hats. (Incorrect.) 
We went to a room where workmen make hats. (Correct.) 
or, 
We went to a room where hats are made. (Correct.) 
2. Changing abruptly from one construction to another, 
especially from singular to plural: : 
When a workman begins to make a hat, he selects some wire, then 
they bend the wire, etc. (Incorrect.) 
‘When a workman begins to make a hat, he selects some wire, then he 
bends it, etc. (Correct.) 
3. Using the same pronoun to refer to two or more different 
things in the same sentence; as, 
Before Sam Davis was hanged he was told by Armstrong that he 
would rather do anything than do the hanging. 
To remedy this, change the construction of the clause 
“he was told by Armstrong”’ to read ‘Armstrong told him.” 
Or, better, make a direct quotation: Armstrong said to him, 
“T would rather do anything,” et 
Note.—Two errors in the use of other pronouns may be 
mentioned here: 
(1) The nominative form of the interrogative pronoun 
when the objective is needed; as, ‘Who did you see?” 
(change to wham). 
. (2) The objective form of the relative pronoun in a clause 
following a verb, whereas the pronoun is really the subject 
of another verb; as, “Whom do you think would have been 
elected?’ (Change to who). : 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, copied from chil-

dren’s compositions, point out the misuse of personal pro- 
nouns, and improve the expression as much as you can:

CLASSES OF ADJECTIVES. 
Study the adjectives in the following sentences: 
1. Then she heard above her a loud, shrill screaming and croaking; 
the largest bird she had ever seen was flying around on wide, 
outstretched wings and coming back in wider circles.—Heidi 
grew very brown and strong and healthy from this outdoor life. 
2. Much time was spent in any conversation in which he took part. 
—Heidi put two or three more. questions.—The grandmother 
had tried every means to soothe the child.—She peered first 
this way and then that. 
The adjectives in the first group all describe, or tell quality; 
hence they are descriptive adjectives. . 
The adjectives in the second group of sentences do not 
describe, or express quality: they point out (this, that, 
first, etc.); tell how many exactly (two, five, etc.), or in an 
indefinite way (many, few, any, etc.); or single out things 
separately (each, either, every, etc.). 
All these are called limiting adjectives. 
The, an, and a are a class of adjectives, but are usually 
called articles. 
Descriptive adjectives are those that express quality. 
Limiting adjectives are those that point out, or in some way 
tell, how much or how many are meant. 
Exercise.—Point out and classify the adjectives in the 
following sentences:
-P-A-G-E-134

1. Dear Mr. Bear, those two fat young girls will make you ‘a good 
meal.

4. The servant did not fancy this plan, but being a happy fellow, 
he said nothing, and worked for the miser another year. 
§. The servant had a good heart, and he was sorry for the poor little 
man. 
6. I will give you three wishes, one for each penny. 
7. She was lying in a fine large room, with beautiful rugs on the 
floor, and chairs and tables of solid gold. 
8. More and more hay came in, until there was little room in which 
to move. : 
9. He walked along for many days. 
to. When the little man came that evening, she had a long list of 
strange names to give him. But he answered to each one, “No.” 
LESSON 147. 
COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES. 
In the sentence, “‘The plate is cold,” the adjective cold 
expresses quality; but there is nothing to tell how much 
of the quality. The word cold is the simple, or absolute, 
form of the adjective; it is not limited by comparison of the 
noun with any other noun. Usually this is called the positive 
degree of the adjective. 
But if some one places ice-cream in the plate, he notices 
that the ice-cream is colder than the plate. The word colder 
indicates that the quality of coldness has increased by one 
step, or degree, made known by comparison of the one object 
with the other. The form colder, then, is called the compara= 
tive degree of the adjective. 
Again, if all the objects on the table be compared with 
the ice-cream, it must be said that the ice-cream is the coldest 
of all. This is as high as the comparison can go, and the 
form coldest is called the superlative degree of the adjective.
-P-A-G-E-135
122 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Comparison is that inflection of adjectives by which 
degrees of quality are indicated. 
The positive degree is the simple, or absolute, form of the 
adjective. 
The comparative degree is the form that indicates a 
greater amount of the quality. 
The superlative degree is the. form that indicates the 
greatest amount of the quality. 
Instead of the endings er and est, sometimes the adverbs 
more, most and less, least are used in comparison; as, satis- 
factory, more satisfactory, most satisfactory, or less satisfactory, 
least satisfactory. 
The comparative degree is used when, of two things com- 
pared, one excels the other. 
It is usually said that the superlative degree is used only 
when more than two things are compared; but standard 
writers are not strict about this usage, for they often use the 
superlative form in comparing two things. 
Exercise.—Select the adjectives in the following sentences, 
and tell the degree of comparison of each; also tell what 
things are compared if the comparative or superlative degree 
is used: 
. These two little girls were the *best children in the world. 
Who should come in but a great black bear. 
. The judge could not refuse this *last wish. 
Let our *oldest girl bring my dinner to-day. 
. Each time she picked one flower, she saw others even prettier. 
. The child was strong and *well, but no bigger than your thumb, 
. He had‘bright eyes, and it was plain that he was cleverer than 
*most children of his age. 
. Little Thumb crept to the *farthest corner of the nest. 
9. He led her to a still larger room quite full of straw. 
xo. The boy was truthful and honest, and the miller was proud of 
him. 
11. As the night was so dark, the young man stopped at the *near-

THE VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER. 
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule, 
The village master taught his little school. 
A man severe he was, and stern to view; 
I knew him well, and every truant knew: 
Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace 
The day's disasters in his morning face; 
Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee 
At all his jokes, for many a joke had he; 
Full well the busy whisper circling round 
Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned. 
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, 
The love he bore to learning was in fault; 
The village all declared how much he knew: 
’Twas certain he could write, and cipher too; 
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, 
And e’en the story ran that he could gauge: 
In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill; 
For e’en though vanquished, he could argue still; 
While words of learned length and thundering sound 
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around; 
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, 
That one small head could carry all he knew.

LESSON 151. 
SYNTAX OF ADJECTIVES. 
The sentences below serve to illustrate some important 
rules of syntax in connection with adjectives: 
1. His office was in the most dark and dingy of all the other quar-. 
ters of the city. 
2. Rural cottages in England are more cosy and homelike than 
any I have seen in the world. 
3. He was the most universal favorite in the village. 
4. His whole room was full of those sort of curios. 
When the superlative degree is used, as in sentence 1, the 
word other should be omitted. All the quarters of the city
-P-A-G-E-138
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
are here compared in one group: one was the “most 
and dingy” of them all. The word other would m: 
appear that one thing was the superlative of a class w 
was shut out from that class. - 
When the comparative degree is used, as in sentence 2, 
one object stands by itself, and all the rest of such objects 
are in another group; hence the word others ought to be used 
in this instance. If “rural cottages in England’’ be placed 
in one circle, and “any others I have seen in the world” 
be placed in another circle, the need for the word others will 
immediately be shown. 
Some words, for example, “‘universal’’ in sentence 3, are’ 
not capable of comparison. By virtue of their meanings 
they have comparative or superlative force already; and 
they should not be qualified by more or most. The sentence 
should read, ‘‘He was the universal favorite in the village,” 
or, “He was the most popular man in the village.”’ 
A very common error is shown in sentence 4. Those who 
commit this error are thinking of the noun that comes after 
sort or kind when they use the plural adjective those. Only 
two adjectives, this and that, have plurals (these and those); 
and they should agree with the nouns they modify, not with 
some distant noun. So the correct sentence would be, 
“His whole room was full of that sort of curios.” 
Another matter of importance may be mentioned here, 
though it is not strictly under syntax: adjectives should 
be used in their right meanings. To speak of ‘‘a mice dinner,” 
“a splendid speech,” “an awful hat,” “a lovely pin,” “a 
gorgeous sleigh ride,” ‘“‘a delightful cake,” ‘‘a funny-looking 
church,” and the like, is to betray a carelessness that even 
a moderate use of the dictionary would correct. 
Exercise.—Use one or more correct and apt words instead 
of each faulty adjective quoted in the last paragraph.

COMPLEX SENTENCES WITH ADJECTIVE CLAUSES. 
Lesson 132 explained what a complex sentence is, also 
what independent and dependent clauses are. 
In most of the sentences studied under relative pronouns, 
the antecedent of the relative pronoun is modified by the 
relative clause. For example, in the sentence, ‘Hard by 
was a vast barn that might have served for a church,” the 
word barn is modified by the clause that might have served 
for a church. 
Since this clause modifies a noun, it is called an adjective 
clause.

according to the directions in Lesson 132:

And passing rich with forty pounds a year; 
Remote from towns he ran his godly race, 
Nor e’er had changed, nor wished to change, his place; 
Unpractised he to fawn, or seek for power, 
By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour; 
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize, 
More skilled to raise the wretched than to rise. 
His house was knowh to all the vagrant train; 
He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain: 
The long-remembered beggar was his guest, 
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast; 
_ The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud, 
Claimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed; 
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay, 
Sat by his fire, and talked the night away, 
Wept o’er his wounds or tales of sorrow done, 
Shouldered his crutch, and showed how fields were won. 
Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow, 
And quite forgot their vices in their woe; 
Careless their merits or their faults to scan, 
His pity gave ere charity began. 
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride, 
And e’en his failings leaned to virtue’s side; 
But in his duty prompt at every call, 
He watched and wept, he prayed and felt for all.

ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SENTENCES. 
Frequently the independent clause is not completed before 
the introduction of the adjective clause, but the adjective 
clause is fitted in between the parts of the independent 
clause; as, “A half-starved dog that looked like Wolf was 
skulking about it.’’ In this sentence the dependent clause 
is that looked like Wolf (and a good clue to the analysis is 
to cut out from the sentence the dependent clause first); 
the independent clause is, ‘A half-starved dog was skulking 
about it.” 
Exercise 1.—Analyze the following complex sentences:

LESSON 166. 
COMPLEX SENTENCES WITH NOUN CLAUSES. 
In Lessons 126 (indirect questions) and 136 (use of relative 
what), the use of a clause as a noun has been seen but not 
explained. 
Consider the following examples: 
1. Rip marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying a keg 
of liquor up this wild mountain. 
Here the clause what mountain, an indirect question, 
is the direct object of the verb marvelled; hence it is a noun 
clause. 
Indirect questions forming noun clauses may be intro- 
duced also by how, why, whether, if, when, where, whither, 
whence, etc.. 
2. What seemed particularly odd to Rip was that these folks main- 
tained the gravest faces.   
  
Here the clause what Rip, introduced by the compound 
relative (or double relative) pronoun what, is used as the 
sttbject of the verb was; hence it is a noun clause. 
Other compound relative pronouns introducing the noun 
clause are whoever, whatever, whosoever, whatsoever. ’ 
Besides the above uses, there are several uses of noun 
clauses which are shown in the following sentences: 
3. (e) I can not say that I have studied them with the eye of a philoso- 
pher. 
(b) What seemed particularly odd to Rip was that these folks 
maintained the gravest faces. 
(c) The poor sailor breathed a wish that he might once more see his 
wife.

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 135 
(d) It is remarkable that the visionary propensity is not confined to 
the native inhabitants of the valley. 
(d) That Franklin succeeded so well was owing to his habit of con- 
stant investigation. 
(e) The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy 
excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved. 
It will be noticed that each of these sentences is introduced 
by the word that; here, however, that is not a relative pro- 
noun, but a conjunction. 
In sentence (a) the noun clause is direct object. In (6) it 
is subjective complement. In (¢) it is in apposition with the 
noun wish. In (d) the noun clause is the subject of the 
principal verb. In the first sentence of (d), if is the intro- 
ductory word, but the clause is as much the subject here as 
it is in the second sentence under (d). In (e) the clause is 
the object of the preposition excepting. 
Exercise.—Select the noun clauses in the following sen- 
tences, telling the exact use of each:   
1. I felt that I wasa stranger in the land. 
2, Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson, must remember the 
Catskill Mountains. 
3..I have observed that he was a simple, good-natured man.

LESSONS 168, 169. 
ADJECTIVES IN DESCRIPTION. 
Much of the effectiveness of description depends upon the 
adjectives used. An unskillful writer is likely to use strong 
adjectives or the superlative degree of those chosen, instead 
of selecting the most apt and accurate. In his essay on 
“Manners,” Emerson says, ‘The person who screams, or 
uses the superlative degree, or converses with heat, puts 
whole drawing-rooms to flight.” What is true of the listener 
may be true of the reader. 
Since in most stories the great interest is in the persons, 
the descriptions of people are very important. In this, as 
in all other description, distinctive peculiarities of features
-P-A-G-E-152
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 187 
or manner should be selected;: but in order that the reader 
may form a clear picture in his mind, details should be. care- 
fully represented. 
Of course a less important character may be dismissed 
with one clever stroke: in “A Christmas Carol’? Dickens 
says of one character, “In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast, 
substantial smile.’’ But inasmuch as young writers have 
not attained such power of portraiture, patient practice is 
well worth while. 
The more important details in personal description may 
be brought out by the use of such adjectives as these: 
Figure—-imposing, gigantic, muscular, shapely, tall, awk- 
ward, clean-cut, well-groomed, lank, flabby, naity, graceful, 
portly, stately, wiry, etc. 
Manner—alert, aggressive, resolute, easy, proud, reserved, 
Friendly, affable, nervous, patient, meek, subdued, slovenly, 
demure, dignified, etc. 
Eyes—large, tender, piercing, deep-set, beady, leaden, sober, 
bleary, watery, cold, shallow, twinkling, dreamy, melancholy, 
merry, mischievous, expressive, kindly, crafty, dull, dancing, etc. 
Nose—straight, sharp, agujliue, Roman, flat, broad, thin, 
snub, hooked, etc. , 
. Mouth—agreeable, broad, grinning, rosebud, stern, grim, 
Smirking, coquettish, etc. 
Hair—shining, ruddy, thick, curly, frowzy, bushy, wavy, 
unkempt, shagey, glistening, soft, thin, grizeled, silvery, luxuri- 
ant, glossy, etc. 
Choosing from these, or using any other suitable adjectives, 
write as follows: 
Exercise 1.—Description of a boy of whom you are sus- 
picious; of a girl whom everyone likes (one paragraph each).

AN IMPROVEMENT IN CONSTANTINOPLE. 
Many changes have been wrought in Constantinople by the Young 
Turk party since it came into power, and none more quickly apparent 
to a person returning after an absence of a few years than the practical 
annihilation of the enormous dog population of the city. For many 
centuries Constantinople has been famed among cities for the countless 
multitudes of dogs which thronged its streets. They were under foot 
at every turn, until the stranger came to think of the city as a vast 
kennel. They were tolerated on account of their work as scavengers, 
and it is to be said to their credit that on the whole they were peaceful 
and well-behaved animals, grateful for small favors, and recognizing 
their place in the general scheme of socicty. But Constantinople now 
possesses a sewerage system, open plumbing and human garbage- 
collectors, and the dogs have little to do and less to eat. Thousands and 
thousands of the vagabond street dogs have recently been killed by the 
authorities, although their destruction was not accomplished without 
opposition from the conservative element of the city, to whom the dogs 
were a traditional municipal institution not lightly to be abolished. 
_ LIGHTENED HER BURDEN. 
The new boy on the ice-cart was German, and a trifle dull, but he 
had a helpful spirit. The first day he took ice to the Skyline apartment- 
house, and Norah Daly’s face looked down at him through the dumb- 
waiter shaft from the fourth story, he saw that she was young and small. 
“‘Gwan!”’ he called up to her, as he had heard the other men call, 
and Norah, stepping back, began to pull with all her might at the rope. 
What was her indignation when at last she had brought the elevator 
up to her floor, with a pull which almost wrenched her arms from their 
sockets, to see the German boy step off the elevator. 
“Dey told me you take small piece, lift it off by your own self,” he 
said, “but I t’ink you are not so strong to do it. I come up, lift it for 
you—so!” : 
And unmindful of Norah’s wrath, he swung off the five cents’ worth 
of ice, and bore it to her refrigerator.

ALL LOOKED ALIKE TO HIM. 
A certain learned professor in New York has a wife and family, but 
professor-like, his thoughts are always with his books. 
One evening his wife, who had been out for some hours, returned to 
find the house remarkably quiet. She had left the children playing 
about, but now they were nowhere to be seen. 
She demanded to be told what had become of them, and the professor 
explained that, as they had made a good deal of noise, he had put them 
to bed without waiting for her or calling a maid. 
“T hope they gave you no trouble,” she said. 
“No,” replied the professor, “with the exception of the one in the 
cot there. He objected a good deal to my undressing him and putting 
him to bed.” 
The wife went to inspect the cot. 
“Why,” she exclaimed, ‘that’s little Johnny Green, from next door!”

A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDIENT. 
A certain prominent minister was compelled not long ago to give 
strict orders that, while he was engaged in the preparation of his ser- 
mons, his young son must be kept reasonably quiet. In spite of this, 
however, there arose one morning a most astonishing noise of banging 
and hammering, which seemed to indicate that the steam-heating pipes 
were being knocked to pieces. Hurrying out of his study, the minister 
encountered his wife. 
“My dear, what in the world is Bobby doing?” he asked. 
“Why, he is only beating on the radiator downstairs,” was the ‘some- 
what surprised reply. 
“Well, he must stop it,” the minister said, decidedly. 
“T don’t think he will harm it, dear,” his wife answered, soothingly, 
“and it is the only thing that will keep him quiet.’”"—Harper’s Weekly. 
SYMPATHY AS A CURE. 
Every one knows the comfort little people derive from a kiss on the 
bruised spot, a loving pat, soft and soothing, on the bumped head. Even 
folk of greater growth are not proof against such sympathetic allevia- 
tions of their pain of body or mind. A tender little bit of human nature 
is that told by Gilbert Watson in “Three Rolling Stones in Japan.” 
The author visited a temple where one of the big stone gods was sup- 
posed to heal all bodily hurts. 
“How does he work his cures?” asked I.
-P-A-G-E-159
144 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
“By personal contact. Rub the place you wish healed with the same 
hand you have rubbed him. If we wait we will be sure to see some one 
try it.” 
No one came for a long time, save one old woman, who laid a little 
bunch of flowers between the feet of the image, in gratitude, doubtless, 
for restoration from disease. By and by a shrill, childish cry made us 
turn. A little girl had fallen and hurt herself; the little knee had bruised 
itself against the sharp corner of an uneven flagstone. Tears welled up 
in her eyes and trickled down her cheeks as the small one held up her 
knee for the old woman’s inspection. The rose-leaf skin was broken 
where the pavement had scratched it. 
The old woman bent over the little sufferer and whispered consolation. 
The look of pain passed, and confidence took its place. Hand in hand, 
the two crossed over to the figure of the god. The woman clapped her 
hands, uttered a prayer, stroked the god’s knee with her withered hand, 
and then rubbed the little human knee very tenderly. 
The cure was effected at once; the child smiled up at the ugly deity 
gratefully, with naive affection in her eyes. The impassive stone statue 
seemed beautiful to her now. The dear old god had kissed her knee 
and made it well, so of course she loved him, and would think of him 
often, sitting there in the temple, waiting to heal little children who 
had hurt themselves. 
SOMEWHAT OF A STRETCH. 
A large and pompous person, wearing a high hat, a long coat, yellow 
spats and a congenital sneer, for several days made himself obnoxious 
around a Washington hotel a bit ago. 
He announced he was from New York, nagged the bell-boys, jawed 
the clerks, cursed the service, roared at the food, complained about his 
room and the elevator and the telephones and the bar, and everything 
else. 
One afternoon he walked over to the porter and said: ‘‘Here, you; 
I’m going to quit this town and go back to New York, where I can get 
some decent service. I want you to buy me two seats in a parlor car 
on the four o’clock New York train. Get me two seats, now, and meet 
me at the station with the tickets. I want one chair to sit in and one 
to put my feet in.” 
The seats were delivered at the train just before it pulled out. One 
of the seats was in Car No. 3 and the other was located in Car No. 4.

HUMOR ON THE MARCH. 
There were times during the Civil War when the soldiers of each army 
would march all night. Mr. L. W. Hopkins, a former Confederate, says 
in his book, ‘From Bull Run to Appomattox,” that the men soon learned 
to sleep on horseback. Occasionally, when a soldier was caught fast 
asleep, his comrade would slip the rein out of his hand and lead his 
horse to a fence corner and hitch it. The sudden stopping would awaken 
him, for he would at once begin to fall. Catching himself, he would 
look round in amazement, and if the night were dark, he had no little 
difficulty in finding his place in the ranks. 
“No amount of hardship or deprivation seemed to dampen the ardor 
of the cavalier. If we were passing a residence, either humble or stately; 
some one would halt in front of it and ‘Hello!’ until he saw a window- 
sash go up and a head poked out, with the usual question, ‘What do 
you want?’ 
“The reply would be, ‘Say, mister, you had better take your chimney 
in; it’s going to rain.’ Then before the angry countryman could get 
his gun, the fun-maker would gallop off to his place in the ranks. And 
thus the night was passed. 
“The cavalryman and his horse got very close to each other, not 
only physically, but heart to heart. They ate together, slept together, 
marched, fought, and often died together. Frequently a wounded 
horse would be seen bearing his wounded rider back from the front. 
“Much of the time, while in Pennsylvania, the men slept with their 
horses tied to the wrist. While the rider slept, the horse cropped the 
grass round him as far out as his tether would allow him, and as close 
up to his rider's body as he could get. Sometimes he would push the 
man’s head aside with his nose to get the grass beneath it. 
“T have seen men by the thousands lying in this manner in the fields, 
with their horses grazing about them; yet I never knew a horse to tread 
on one, or in any way injure him.” 
HOW ONE FATHER HELPED PRACTICE. 
A little girl sat at an old square piano. Her mother moved about: 
in the next room, preparing supper. Near the piano sat the father, 
carefully tidied up after his day in the machine-shop. 
“All the way home,” the man said to his little daughter, “I was 
trying to whistle that new piece of yours, Mollie, but I forgot some 
parts, and you must help me. So play it’ through, please.” 
Mollie began, pleasure and importance in her face. At the second 
page she stumbled and dropped from the tempo, but hurried on.

“That was the place I forgot,” interrupted her father. ‘Please play 
it over, just the air.” . 
Over and over she was induced to play it, first with one hand, then 
with the other, until the passage had become familiar, and her little 
fingers had fairly mastered the difficulty. 
“Do you know,” she said, a few days later, as she played the simple 
melody to her teacher, “‘my father thinks this part is so pretty—the 
prettiest part in the whole piece. He likes to hear it over and over.” 
“Oh,” thought the teacher, ‘‘with such parents what musicians I 
could make of even every-day material!” 
To-day this girl is studying in New York under distinguished teachers, 
playing accompaniments for a well-known singer, invited to delightful 
houses as an honored guest,and leading a very interesting if an arduous life. 
Her teacher insists that she was not exceptionally gifted; that the 
secret of her success lay very largely in the patient, intelligent oversight 
of her parents, and their tact in getting her to master the difficult parts 
of each lesson, and so the successive steps of technique. 
NOT MAD, BUT DINING. 
During those periodic spasms known as ‘‘mad-dog scares” every one 
loses his head except the dog and—usually—his owner. This thrilling 
tale comes from the Post-Despatch of St. Louis, in which city the incident 
took place. A crowd had gathered at a street corner to watch a hand- 
some fox-terrier that was running about with his nose in the air. White 
froth was running from the dog’s mouth. 
“He’s mad!” yelled a fat man. The fox-terrier stood in the centre 
of the group, with wide-open eyes, either too mad or too frightened to 
move. At this juncture the policeman arrived. A dozen voices began 
to tell him that the dog was mad; that it must be killed; that it had been 
snapping at the children; that it began to froth when it passed a pool 
of water, and how best to shoot it. 
A tall, quiet-looking woman pushed through the crowd and started 
toward the dog. A dozen men yelled at her, two or three men grabbed 
at her. She picked the dog up and started out of the crowd. 
The policeman stopped her with, ‘‘Madam, that dog is mad. He 
must be shot. Look at the foam coming out of his mouth.” 
“Foam!” she said, contemptuously. ‘‘That’s a cream puff he was 
eating.” 
A FRIEND IN NEED. 
The clumsy man was covered with confusion when, plunging forward 
as the car started with a jerk, he knocked down an umbrella, resting 
against feminine garments, and heard the handle snap beneath his feet.

“Oh, I—I beg ten thousand pardons!” he stammered. 
“It is of no consequence,” said a sweet woman's voice; ‘not of the 
least consequence.’’ 
“There's a woman in there who's all right,” blurted the awkward 
one to an acquaintance, as he fell out on the platform to cool aad col- 
lect his wits. ‘I’ve broken her umbrella to smithereens, and she spoke 
as if I’d handed her a present. See, it’s the one in gray.” 
“M-m, that’s my wife,” said his acquaintance. ‘Well, of course 
she is ‘all right,’ but in this particular instance she’s been suggesting 
for the last month or so that I buy her a new umbrella. So——” 
“Oh!” said the awkward one. 
AN INGENIOUS DEVICE. 
“The proprietor of a certain hotel on the Maine coast had been much 
harassed by the accusations of guests who ‘‘overslept,’’ and thereby 
failed to make connections or keep appointments. They invariably 
insisted they had never been called, abused his employees as well as 
himself, and declared they would never stop with him again. Of course 
they usually did stop, but that did not altogether even matters from 
the proprietor’s standpoint. 
At last, after long and anxious thought, he hit upon a plan which 
seemed calculated to insure justice and satisfaction to all parties. 
It was one of the most abusive of his patrons under the old regula- 
tions on whom the new scheme was first tried. He had retired with 
reiterated injunctions to wake him in time to catch that five-o’clock 
train. It was midwinter. The proprietor had learned by experience 
how difficult of pérsuasion is a sound sleeper in a warm bed at that hour 
of the morning. At a quarter past four there was a loud rap upon the 
guest's door. Noanswer. Then a still louder summons. 
“What's the matter?’’ came the response. 
“Get up, quick, sir—please,” in a tone of excitement, “and sign 
this receipt!” 
“Receipt?” 
“Yes, sir; here it is and here’s the pencil. Right quick, sir, please! 
It’s very important—won't take you a minute, sir, to sign it!” 
Muttering incoherently, the guest stumbled out of bed. The very 
strangeness of the demand had roused him as doubtless no ordinary 
summons could do. Unlocking the door, he thrust out his hand, con- 
fused ideas of registered letters, checks, legacies, crowding upon his 
half-awakened senses, The paper which he drew inside bore the date 
and “Called at 4.15, as requested. Sign here.”

A BATTLE ROYAL. 
Every reader of Kipling recalls the famous story of the fight between 
the mongoos and the cobra. An exciting account of another such con- 
test is given by a writer in the Ceylon Times. When the mongoos first 
caught sight of the cobra, it quietly smelled of the snake's tail and then 
hung round, awaiting events with curiosity. But it had not long to 
wait, for the cobra spread its hood, hissed out its angry warning, and 
prepared to strike from its coil. 
Now began a most interesting and deadly battle—of feint and counter 
feint by the mongoos and strike and lightning-like recovery by its 
adversary, which was also on the defensive, all the time watching for 
the opportunity to get in its properly aimed bite. 
Time after time the mongoos squirmed slowly up to within reach of 
those terrible fangs—belly on ground—with every gray hair of its 
body erect with anger and excitement, its eyes glaring from its head, 
which, by the way, it invariably held sidewise during this approach 
and attack. 
The moment the cobra struck, in a flash back sprang the mongoos, 
and although often it appeared impossible that it could have escaped 
the dreaded fangs, not a scratch harmed it. There it would be again, 
wearing the cobra out and pressing the advantage inch by inch. 
At last, with a growl and a sharp cry, the plucky little beast flew in, 
dodged the strike, and seized the snake behind the head, never for a 
moment getting under its mouth. Right at the nape of the neck and 
head it scrunched with a loud cracking sound. The struggles and 
twisting and turning of the cobra availed nothing. Again and again 
the mongoos returned to the now writhing reptile and bit its head and 
body until it lay dying. . 
Finally the mongoos ate three or four inches of its mortal foe, care- 
fully avoiding the fangs and poison glands. These I picked up by a 
stick and found broken, with the venom sacks attached. . 
. Contrary to popular belief, I am of opinion that the mongoos is not 
immune from snake poison, else why should the creature so particu- 
larly avoid being bitten? It is only by its marvellous activity that it 
escapes the spring and darting strike of its deadly enemy, the cobra- 
de-capello.

TEACHING KINDNESS. 
_ One of the hard lessons for schoolboys to learn is that among the 
first principles of right conduct are 
Kindness in another’s trouble, 
Courage in our own. 
When Dean Howson was a young man he was for some time master 
in an English public school. In writing of friends and associates, Canon 
Farrar tells this story of the dean as a master of boys: 
“T have heard some of his former pupils at Liverpool College speak of 
him with warm affection, and record how, even in the smallest matters, 
he assiduously strove to guide them aright. 
“One of these pupils—now a clergyman—-said that, as a boy, he had 
once put out his foot for another boy to stumble over as he came out 
of the school gate. The boy was tripped up; and while the offender 
was laughing at his fall, Doctor Howson, who happened to pass, merely 
looked. at him, and said, ‘Was that kind?’—nothing more..., 
“*VYet,’ said the clergyman, ‘that lesson, conveyed in but: three words, 
was so spoken that it has remained with me all my life.’” 
AN UNCOMFORTABLE BEDFELLOW, 
A dog may be man’s best friend, but one can have a bit too much 
even of a friend. At least, such was the conclusion Mansfield Parkyns 
came to while travelling in Africa. He tells his experience in “Life in 
Abyssinia.” The whole country was moistened by rains; in the low 
_plains the deep mud was highly disagreeable to bare feet, softening the 
skin and rendering it more easily penetrated by thorns. 
“The reader may ask how we managed to sleep on the sloppy bosom 
of a bog. It was quite simple. We got hydropathic treatment gratis. 
Our mattresses were pieces of wood and stone placed on enough stones 
to keep them out of the mud. These, with pieces of tanned hide spread 
over them, formed our beds.
-P-A-G-E-165
150 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
“When the rain came the hide was our covering, too. Now this may 
not seem a comfortable sort of a couch; indeed, it is not luxurious, and 
requires a knack of turning round like a dog, and an adapting of the 
body to the risings and hollows of the bed. One couldn’t sleep well if 
he rested his hip-bone on the apex of a conical pebble. 
“My dog did not like rain, so when it stormed he came whining, deter- 
mined to get under cover. He was a good, friendly beast, but he was 
rather large for a bedfellow, being as big as a Newfoundland. His long, 
thick, coarse hair when wet was odoriferous. The day’s tramp through 
the mud did not tend to cleanse him, and he was never very choice in 
his dirt. So, when he would attempt to force his way in, I would say, 
‘Maychal, so far as board goes you shall share my last crumb, but, 
really, my bed is just large enough for me.’ 
“But he would never listen to reason. He would seize the corner of 
the leather in his teeth and tug away at it, letting on to me a few quarts 
of water. As the best of a bad job, I would at last let him in, but he 
would not be satisfied until he got the best place. 
“Fifty times, roused by some sound, he would plant his great paws 
on my nose, eyes, mouth, anywhere, bark with fury, dash off, dragging 
the comforter with him, and then come back, wet and recking, and 
demand to be taken in again. 
“This was a sample of my nights.” 
ONE PASSENGER TOO MANY. 
Two men on a hunting and fishing trip in the Province of Ontario 
had an adventure with a bear, which is described by a writef in Recrea- 
tion, They were crossing a lake toward their camp, and steered toward 
what they thought was the burned end of a sunken log. It proved, 
however, to be a large bear. He was swimming slowly, evidently 
enjoying his cooling bath, and in no hurry to go ashore. They had no 
weapons, and made their plans to drive the bear toward their camp, 
where their guide was at work, and when within a few hundred feet of 
his rifle all would be right. 
“A few quick strokes put our boat between him and the edge of the 
lake. We naturally supposed he would turn aside and let us drive him 
before us. We were wrong in our supposition. He swam right up to 
the canoe, and strove to go past us. 
““ Fit him, and turn him again!’ called Bill. I raised myself in the 
canoe, reached out, and struck him fair and hard on top of the head. 
Unfortunately, I struck too hard and broke my paddle. The overreach 
upset the canoe, and overboard went Bill and I.

“Shout for Tom and the rifle,’ suggested Bill. 
“There seemed nothing else to do, and so we shouted. Our first ‘Hello? 
disturbed the bear, and he hugged the canoe a little closer. The canoe 
had drifted nearer the headland, and Tom was ready for us. A few 
more minutes and we were rid of our uninvited guest. 
“As Tom brought his rifle to sight, I crouched as low in the water as 
Tcould. There was a puff of smoke, the crack of the rifle, and the dull 
‘pesh’ that told of an unerring aim. Bruin slipped down into the 
water stone-dead. 
“In less than five minutes Bill and I were safe ashore, and, save our 
wetting, none the worse for an exciting adventure.” 
A WITTY PASHA. 
Bribery is common in the East. One of the notable contributory 
causes is the rigid suppression of a free press by the powers in authority, 
for there as elsewhere the fear of publicity is the beginning of official 
wisdom. But it must not be supposed that the universal official cor- 
ruption is unknown in the East; it is, on the contrary, a tender subject 
there, as a humorous story within a story, told by the late Rev. H. H. 
Jessup, D.D., in his recent book, “Fifty-Three Years in Syria,” bears 
witness: 
“One day in 1873 Doctor Van Dyck, manager of the press in connec- 
tion with the work of propaganda of the Syrian Protestant College at 
Beirut, was sent for by Kamil Pasha, the governor, to come to the serai, 
as he was about to shut up the press for a violation of the press laws. 
Doctor Van Dyck proceeded to the serai and asked the pasha what he 
meant, 
“The pasha, holding up a little tract, said, ‘Was this printed at your 
press?” hy es! ; 
““Then it must be confiscated, as it contains an attack on the Turkish 
government.’ 
“Wherein,’ asked Doctor Van Dyck, ‘does it attack the govern- 
ment?’ 
“The pasha pointed out several passages which criticised the bribery 
and corruption everywhere prevalent, perjury and lying among wit- 
nesses and public officials, and the fact that ‘truth had fallen in the 
streets and equity could not enter.’ 
““‘Are not these statements irue?’ said Doctor Van Dyck. ‘Your 
excellency ought to put a copy into the hands of every government 
official in your pashalic. Is it not so?’
-P-A-G-E-167
152 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
“*Have you never heard the story of the Cadi el Ah-war?’ asked the 
pasha. 
“And what is that?’ queried the doctor. 
‘Well,’ began the pasha, ‘once there was a famous one-eyed cadi 
{judge]. One day a man came to court and addressed him as follows: 
“*Good morning, O one-eyed cadi! May your day be blessed, O one- 
eyed cadi! I have heard of the noble character and justice of the one- 
eyed cadi, and I would ask the distinguished and revered one-eyed cadi 
to do me justice, and——’ 
“*Stop!’ interrupted the cadi. ‘Supposing I am one-eyed, doI want 
to be everlastingly reminded of it? Get out of my sight!’ 
“*And so,’ concluded the pasha, ‘we know that these reflections on 
our country and our courts are true, but we don’t want to be publicly 
reminded of it!’” 
A GENTLE TEACHER. 
“The schoolhouse should be counted as a sanctuary against fear,” 
said wise Roger Ascham, tutor of Queen Elizabeth. In the colonial 
times, however, this precept was almost unknown, for the majority of 
masters ruled by the terror and the use of the rod, and by many ingenious 
and often cruel devices. Some of these unique punishments are told by 
Alice Morse Earle, in “Child Life in Colonial Days.’’ To offset the 
dreary account, however, she describes the quaint and delightfully 
tender methods of one worthy pedagogue: 
“The colonial schoolrooms resounded with the sound of the rod. ‘A 
besomme of byrche for babes,’ was the usual, every-day method of 
discipline. Another penalty was to place the culprit’s nose in a cleft 
stick, Two delinquents were often yoked together like oxen. Whisper- 
ing-sticks were wooden sticks tied in the mouth with strings, like bits. 
Culprits were made to sit on the unistool, a stool with one leg, to wear 
dunce caps, to stand in uncomfortable positions, and to hold heavy 
weights. One dame made a naughty child hold a heavy book by one 
Jeaf—the least motion of the child would tear the leaf. This same ingen- 
ious mistress also bestowed rewards of merit, one of which was the divi- 
sion of a strawberry among six diligent pupils. 
“Samuel Dock stands out a bright and shining light against this dark 
background of savagery. Some of his methods are told by himself. 
“How I receive children in school. The child is first welcomed by 
the other scholars, who extend their hands to it. It is then asked by me 
if it will be industrious and obedient. If it assents, I explain how it 
should behave. When it gets as far as a-b abs, its father must give it 
a penny and its mother cook it two eggs, because of its industry.”
-P-A-G-E-168
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 158 
“Master Dock himself gave his pupils little presents as they worthily 
progressed. He did not teach his little folk the catechism, but he made 
them learn what he called ‘The bright, living flowers of the New Testa- 
ment.’ His schoolroom must have been a paradise in those days of 
harsh discipline.” 
WHAT HE WAS. 
Miss Bixby was not given to coquetry, but ‘she was pardonably 
anxious to make an agreeable impression upon Professor Clark. He 
was young and handsome, and like herself, learned, she gathered from 
the common friend who was plotting to bring them together. Also 
the friend, a sprightly North Carolina woman, teferred to him as a 
“tar-heel.”” 
“A what?" Miss Bixby inquired. 
“Tar-heel,”’ it appeared, was the vivacious name for a native of 
North Carolina. 
Miss Bixby, who modestly felt the need in herself of an added touch 
of vivacity, impressed the term upon a memory which, surcharged with 
knowledge, had been known to be treacherous. 
However profound a conversation is destined to become, it should 
begin, in society, Miss Bixby was aware, with graceful nothings. “You 
are a tar-heel, I believe?” it seemed to her would serve the purpose of 
breaking the ice. 
He was handsomer and more intellectual-looking than she had 
expected, even; also shyer and more reserved. The polite commonplace 
which she had prepared would be just the thing to set him at ease. 
Raising her voice, she addressed him across her friend’s dinner-table. 
“T believe, Professor Clark,” she remarked, with sweet graciousness, 
“that you are a tadpole.” 
A GENEROUS EMPLOYER'S PLAN. 
~ An employer in an Eastern town has a form of betterment work 
peculiarly his own. During his business life he has planned and financed 
home-owning projects for more than seventy men with families, some 
being his own employees, and others hard-working fellows in whom he 
has taken an interest. These men have had, on the average, not more 
than fifty dollars’ savings to start with, and he has given attention to 
this sort largely because men with more savings finance themselves. 
When a willing young fellow with a family could scrape together fifty 
ora hundred dollars toward the purchase of his own home, this employer 
has helped him in selection of a good piece of property, got him a loan 
covering two-thirds of the price from a building society of which he is
-P-A-G-E-169
154 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
an officer, and arranged for the other third by lending it out of his own 
pocket at three or four per cent, or getting the money for him elsewhere. 
A typical case was that of a clerk, earning twenty-five dollars a week, 
whose landlord raised the rent beyond what he could pay. Somebody 
told him of this employer, and the clerk went to him. All he could raise 
in cash was fifty dollars, but the employer found upon investigation that 
he paid his debts promptly even though nothing had been saved, and 
that he had adopted a child. A plot of ground 100x150 feet in area was 
purchased for five hundred dollars, and a three-thousand-dollar house 
built upon it. The building was paid for by a first mortgage in a build- 
ing society at six per cent. interest, while the ground was paid for with 
a loan of five hundred dollars from the employer, covered by second 
mortgage at three and a half per cent. This clerk had been paying 
thirty dollars a month for a flat, and the landlord wanted thirty-five. 
He now moved into a home of his own, with plenty of land for a garden, 
reducing grocery bills, and the whole cost was just what he had formerly 
paid for his flat, thirty dollars a month, paying interest on both mort- 
gages and steadily extinguishing the principal. Some months ago, 
when this clerk died, he left his home clear of all debt. ‘It is now worth 
five thousand dollars. He also left substantial savings, as the work of 
buying his home taught him how to manage his income. Without this 
kindly start he might have died poor, with nothing but a lot of rent 
receipts to show for his lifework. 
GOT HIS GROWTH EN ROUTE. 
He was a tall, lank, sad-eyed looking preacher of the gospel, but a 
great humorist withal. In a certain section of the British Isles there is 
a very Slow teeipand, as is well known, tickets are collected as you 
pass through the gates of the station at your destination. The sad-eyed 
man, on passing out, presented a half ticket to the collector. 
“Hey! look here! this is not your ticket, sir—this is a boy’s ticket!” 
“Well,” slowly purred the great man; “(I was a boy when I started.” 
MOODY’S GALLANTRY. 
Attorney General Moody was once riding on the platform of a Boston 
street car, standing next to the gate that protected passengers from 
cars coming on the other track. A Boston lady came to the door of the 
car, and, as it stopped, started toward the gate, which was hidden from 
her by the men standing before it. 
“Other side, please, lady,” said the conductor. 
He was ignored as only a born-and-bred Bostonian can ignore a man. 
The lady took another step toward the gate.
-P-A-G-E-170
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 155° 
“You must get off the other side,” said the conductor. 
“T wish to get off on this side,” came the answer in tones that con- 
gealed the official into momentary silence. Before he could explain or 
exposttilate, Mr. Moody came to his assistance. 
“Stand to one side, gentlemen,” he remarked quietly. ‘‘The lady 
wishes to climb over the gate."’—Cleveland Leader. 
THE PACE, 
The following story reminds one of Alice’s mad race with the Red 
Queen in the country where ‘‘it takes all the ranning you can do to keep 
in the same place.” They were tramping in Switzerland, and when, 
after a long, dusty afternoon's walk, a bed and a bath and a dinner 
seemed three very desirable things, they spoke to a farmer: 
“Interlaken? How far is it?” 
“Two miles,” he replied. 
The tourists marched hopefully on, but after half an hour had passed, 
and no town was in sight, they demanded of another peasant: 
“How far are we from Interlaken?” 
“Just two miles!” he shouted back. ‘‘Keep right on.” 
Again the weary trampers toiled on. Another half-hour elapsed 
and still Interlaken was hidden from their view. 
“Are we anywhere near Interlaken?” they implored, when they met 
the third farmer. 
“‘But two short miles,” he replied, as had the others. 
The tourists turned to each other in despair; then the fortunate 
sense of humor intervened. : 
“Well,” said one, “thank heaven we're holding our own, anyhow!” 
A POSTPONED DEPARTURE. 
Every one who knows American Indians at all knows that one of 
their superstitions is that they know when they are going to die. It 
has frequently happened, says Mr. James McLaughlin in “My Friend, 
the Indian,” that the elaboration with which an Indian approaches 
death and the freedom from mental cares that follows upon the com- 
Pletion of the preparations effect a cure of the bodily ailments from 
which he has been suffering. A case in point is that of Mrs. Standing 
Ells. In the late seventies she painted herself for death. Some one 
had said that she was sick. Therefore she lay down to die. 
She first put her house in order and then moved out of it into the 
tepee that was set up near at hand. When Mrs, Standing Ells felt 
that her time was come, she lay down in the tepee and told Standing 
Ells that her end was at hand.
-P-A-G-E-171
156 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Standing Ells-made no attempt to dissuade her. She had been a 
good wife to him, but she had come to the borderland of the country 
of ghosts, and it was not for him to dispute the time of her going. 
“JT want a coffin,” said Mrs. Standing Elis. ‘‘Go to the father at 
the agency and tell him. And I would have a coffin that will fit me. 
It is not well that a woman should lie in a coffin made for a man.” 
Standing Ells was the lord of his household, according to the custom 
of his people, but he had lived with Mrs. Standing Ells for many years, 
and there had been but one voice in that household, and that was not 
the voice of Standing Ells. So he got together, with much labor, a 
measure made up of pieces of knotted cord, and measured Mrs. Standing 
Ells as she lay in the tepee. 
Now it took some time for the making of the coffin. The carpenter 
was not a fast workman, and Standing Ells had been unconscionably 
delayed. Mrs. Standing Ells had become impatient. She was all ready 
to go, and did not like the idea of being delayed. But she would not 
go without a sight of the coffin the white father was to provide for her. 
She could not lie in the tepee and wait for the coming of Standing 
Ells, but would sit without. And there she sat, her face painted for 
death and her relatives grouped about her, expectant. 
Still Standing Ells delayed, and her impatience gave way to vexation. 
When the husband of her lodge did arrive, late in the evening, with 
the coffin, she was angry, and getting up, she berated him for a laggard. 
When the coffin was taken from the cart and stood on the ground, on 
end, she stood beside it and found it was taller than she. Standing Ells 
received a scolding, the group of relatives dispersed, the old lady carried 
the coffin into the house on her shoulder, and when I left Fort Totten, 
several years later, the coffin still stood on end in the house of Standing 
Ells, 
Shelves had been fitted into it, and it was doing duty as a cupboard.

ANALYSIS OF COMPOUND SENTENCES. 
The following sentences should be studied closely in order 
that their structure may be understood: 
1. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. 
2. They and their spirit voices faded together; and the night be- 
came as it had been when he walked home. 
3. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from 
public life forevermore; and the warehouse was as snug, 
and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would de- 
sire to see upon a winter's night. 
Simple sentences were studied, up to Lesson 117, Part 1, 
then complex sentences. Now in sentence 1, above, two 
simple sentences are connected so as to form one sentence; 
in sentence 2, a simple and a complex sentence are made 
into one; in sentence 3, two complex sentences are joined 
into one. . 
In each of the three sentences there are two independent 
clauses: all such are called compound sentences. 
A compound sentence is one that contains two independent 
clauses. : 
There may be one or more dependent clauses in a com- 
pound sentence; but there must be at least two independent 
clauses,

4. Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, 
but always with a happy end. 
5. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on 
foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling 
men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, 
and it was rich. 
Exercise 2.—Analyze the following compound sentences: 
1. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, 
and sometimes Marley; but he answered to both names. 
2, He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he 
iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree 
at Christmas. 
3. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk went down 
a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times,

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
THE KING OF DENMARK’S RIDE. 
Word was brought to the Danish king, 
(Hurry!) 
That the love of his heart lay suffering, 
And pined for the comfort his voice would bring; 
(Oh, ride as if you were flying!) 
Better he loves each golden curl 
On the brow of that Scandinavian girl 
Than his rich crown-jewels of ruby and pearl; 
And his Rose of the Isles is dying. 
Thirty nobles saddled with speed; 
. (Hurry!) Each one mounted a gallant steed 
Which he kept for battle and days of need; 
(Oh, ride as though you were flying!) 
Spurs were stuck in the foaming flank, 
Worn-out chargers staggered and sank; 
Bridles were slackened and girths were burst; 
But, ride as they would, the king rode first, 
For his Rose of the Isles lay dying. 
His nobles are beaten, one by one; 
(Hurry)! 
They have fainted, and faltered, and homeward gone; 
The little fair page now follows alone, 
For strength and for courage trying. 
The king looked back at that faithful child, 
‘Wan was the face that answering smiled. 
They passed the drawbridge with clattering din, 
Then he dropped, and only the king rode in 
Where his Rose of the Isles lay dying. 
The king blew a blast on his bugle-horn, 
(Silence!) 
No answer came, but faint and forlorn 
An echo returned on the cold gray morn, 
Like the breath of a spirit sighing: 
The castle portal stood grimly wide; 
None welcomed the king from that weary ride!

For, dead in the light of the dawning day, 
The pale, sweet form of the welcomer lay, 
Who had yearned for his voice while dying. 
The panting steed with a drooping crest 
Stood weary; 
The king returned from the chamber of rest, 
The thick sobs choking in his breast, 
And that dumb companion eyeing, 
The tears gushed forth, which he strove to check; 
He bowed his head on his charger’s neck,— 
“O steed that every nerve didst strain, 
Dear steed! our ride hath been in vain 
To the halls where my love lay dying.”

VERBS IN DESCRIPTION. 
It was shown in Part I that description depends much 
upon the use of apt and expressive adjectives. 
Again, in representing for the reader’s eye or ear the 
various sounds and movements that are characteristic of 
a person, sea, forest, animal, etc., much will depend upon 
the choice of verbs. These also should be chosen with a 
view to aptness and expressiveness, not with an easy-going 
satisfaction that “something like it will do.” 
Notice carefully the following examples of the skillful 
use of verbs and verbal derivatives to help produce a picture: 
1. Again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders, compressing 
air into music, and rolling it forth upon the soul. What 
Jong-drawn cadences! What solemn sweeping concords! It 
grows more and more dense and powerful; it fills the vast 
pile, and: seems to jar the very walls; the ear is stunned; 
the senses are overwhelmed. And now it is winding up in 
full jubilee. It is rising from the earth to heaven. The very 
soul seems rapt away and floated upward on this swelling tide 
of harmony.

In giving a description of a house, for instance, a general 
view is given, which usually sums up in a word the impression 
made upon the one looking at it; after that the details in 
regard to material, size, shape, windows, and doors, and the 
condition of all these. Next the interior is described: the 
general impression, halls, stairways, general condition, furni- 
ture, arrangement of rooms as seen from the hall; finally, 
if necessary, some particular room is described. 
Some of the adjectives often used for this are: 
House.—Substantial, roomy, fresh-looking, humble, stately, spacious, 
comfortable, cosy, imposing, gloomy, miserable, rusty, dismal, old-fash- 
toned, antiquated, picturesque, clean, etc.

LESSON 193. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
To attain ease and grace of expression is an accomplish- 
ment that requires years of patient effort, even if the writer 
is born to great original thoughts; but there are certain 
simple methods of recasting bare and clumsy sentences that 
may easily be learned and conveniently used. 
For example, the progressive improvement in expression 
may be illustrated by some exercises such as children write: 
1. Short, abrupt, disconnected sentences: Llewellyn was a great 
huntsman. He would go fox hunting a great deal. He had a pack of 
hounds that he would take with him. Llewellyn would blow the bugle 
for them when he went hunting. One day he blew the bugle for the 
hounds to come. Gelert was his favorite dog. He was the last to come 
that day. 
2. Grouped into compound sentences: Llewellyn was a great hunts- 
man. He would go fox hunting a great deal, and he had a pack of hounds 
that he would take with him. Llewellyn would blow the bugle for them 
when he went hunting. One day he blew the bugle for the hounds to 
come, but Gelert was the last to come. Gelert was his favorite dog. 
3. Dependent clauses, participial phrases, apposition, etc.: Llewellyn 
was a great huntsman. When he went fox hunting, as he frequently 
‘did, he would take his pack of hounds with him, blowing the bugle for 
them to come. One day when he blew the bugle for the hounds, Gelert, 
his favorite dog, was the last to come. 
Some practice in improvement of sentence structure will 
be found helpful. The key to grace of expression may, to 
some extent, be found in variety of expression. Too much 
sameness soon becomes uninteresting and wearisome to the 
reader.

shot the seven sons, ané Diana shot six of the daughters, leaving Niobe 
only one child. They turned around and said, ‘‘ What does one miserable

or where, and modify verbs: also that some adverbs modify 
adjectives and other adverbs. 
*
-P-A-G-E-187
170 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Now a clause that modifies a verb, an adjective or an 
adverb is called an adverb clause; for example, 
1. He rushed on danger because he loved it. 
2. Iam told he is as prompt as the King of France for that work. 
In sentence 1, the clause because he loved it answers the 
question why and modifies the verb rushed. In sentence 2, 
the clause as the King of France (is prompt) modifies the 
adjective prompt; it tells how much, to what degree. Both 
these modifiers are adverb clauses. 
Adverbial clauses are of several kinds, because they express 
various relations. They are as follows: 
I. TIME: ‘They followed the same path which he had taken, until 
it led them into a wood of tall trees.” 
2. PLACE: “ Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.” 
3. MANNER: “‘One of the downcast lowering smiles gleamed along 
his countenance, enlivening it as a passing meteor enlivens a 
winter sky.” 
4. CAUSE, Or REASON: ‘'The King of Castile choked of thirst 
because the great builer was not beside to hand his cup.” 
5. DEGREE, Of COMPARISON: “He will do as much honor to the break- 
fast as a starved mouse [will do honor] to a housewife’s cheese.” 
(In analyzing such a sentence, expand as here shown.) 
6. conpiTion: “If he had not been so hasty, I might perhaps have 
taken service with him.” 
7. CONCESSION: ‘‘ Though he had secured a good breakfast, it was no 
great reserve upon which to travel.” 
8. PURPOSE: “My nephew shall tell us by the way, that we may 
know how to frame our report to Crawford and Oliver.” 
9. RESULT: ‘‘The merchant then let his dark eyebrows sink over 
his keen eyes, so that the last became scarce visible.” 
Exercise.—Study these carefully, so that when the teacher 
reads them at random you can recognize each kind. 
(Note.—As a general rule, the kind of adverbial clause is 
to be determined by the meaning of the whole clause; but 
frequently the conjunction introducing it will show what

in Lesson 317.)

judicious use of participial phrases; for example, instead 
of writing as follows:

Dick had heard that the streets of London were paved with gold, 
and had now decided to go there,

Or occasionally change such a sentence as this— 
But when he got there he was very much disappointed, for there 
were as many poor people in London as in the country. 
Write instead, for the sake of variety, 
But when he reached London he was very much disappointed,

SHORT AND LONG SENTENCES. 
Sometimes, in any kind of composition, short sentences 
are best; sometimes long sentences are best. But no one 
kind should be used altogether, as the reading becomes 
monotonous. 
When little children cross over from the habit of oral 
composition (in which they have not separated sentences 
at all), and begin written composition, their sentences are 
likely to be very short and abrupt. This habit, however, 
should be broken as soon as possible, so that more natural 
and flowing sentences may become the rule. 
Exercise.—Rewrite the following composition so as to 
combine the short sentences into longer complex and com- 
pound sentences: 
THE LION AND THE MOUSE.

the mouse. The mouse was so frightened that he begged the lion to 
let him go. .The mouse said, ‘‘If you will let me go I will do anything

The lion said to himself, ‘This mouse is too small to eat, and I will let 
him go.” So he let the mouse go. Not long after this some hunters 
set a trap to catch the lion. It was not long before the lion was caught 
inthe trap. The lion bellowed and roared. The mouse heard him, and

Danes were fighting the English people. One day King Alfred was 
wandering through the woods to free himself from the Danes. He came 
to a wood-chopper’s hut. He asked the lady if she would let him stay 
ali night. The lady had some cakes baking on the hearth-stone. She 
told the king to watch the cakes while she milked. He was so worried 
over the people of the land that he let the cakes burn to a crisp. When 
the lady came back she was angry. She hit him over the head with a 
stick. She didn’t know he was a king. He didn’t mind her anger. 
And then he went back and drove the Danes out of the land.

LESSON. 214. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. — 
Another way to avoid monotony-is to cultivate freedom 
in the use of adverbial expressions—namely, adverbs, adverb 
phrases, adverb clauses, and adverbial objective of nouns, 
Even when the meaning does not require the writer to 
turn one of these into another, it is less tiresome to the reader 
to meet with several constructions than the same one often 
repeated. 
The following are examples of the changes alluded to: 
I. (a) Paul Revere told one of his friends to stand in the belfry of 
the Old North Church and listen and watch very closely. 
(6) Paul Revere told one of his friends to stand in the belfry of 
the Old North Church and listen and watch with close atten- 
tion (or, with all his ears and eyes: or, as closely as he could). 
2. (a) All at once the stillness of the night was broken by the tread 
of soldiers and the cry, ‘“‘To arms!’ 
(b) Suddenly the stillness of the night was broken by the tread 
of soldiers and the cry, “To arms!” 
3. (a) Paul Revere jumped into the saddle and went as fast as he 
could to arouse every farmer. 
(b) Paul Revere jumped into the saddle and rode with all his 
might (or, with all speed), to arouse every farmer. 
Exercise.—In the following paragraphs, change the adverb- 
ial expressions to others of similar meaning: 
(a) One was named Cassim and the other Ali Baba. When the father 
died, he divided his property between the two sons. Cassim married a 
tich widow and lived comfortably, while Ali Baba married a poor woman 
and had to cut trees in the forest for a living. 
One day as Ali Baba was in the woods he saw a band of forty robbers 
approaching him in a cloud of dust. He climbed a tree in a hurry and 
from his hiding-place saw the robber captain stand before the cave 
and say, ‘Open Sesame.” 
(6) Orpheus played so beautifully on his lute that all animals, birds, 
-and even trees and rocks stopped to listen to his music. One day he 
saw a beautiful maiden named Eurydice. He fell so deeply in love with

her that he married her. For a while they lived together very happily. 
But one day when Eurydice was walking in the tall grass, ‘a serpent 
darted out and bit her. 
LESSON 215. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
The infinitive phrase is a very useful expression, since it 
expresses in brief form such a number of relations. It con- 
sists of a verbal expression (introduced usually by to) that 
may take objects or modifiers just as verbs do. It answers 
the purpose of several kinds of clauses, and may easily be 
converted into one or another of these for the sake of variety. 
Examples of infinitives and their equivalents: 
I. (a) Some life-saving men saw us, and started in their boat to 
save us. 
(b) Some life-saving men saw us, and started in their boat with 
the intention of saving us (or, for the purpose of saving us). 
2. (a) They did not want their children to forget the language and 
customs of their native land. So they resolved to go to America.

phrases to equivalent phrases or clauses:

LESSON 218. 
NARRATION. 
Narration, or the relating of stories, is the most widespread 
and popular of the three kinds of composition. Almost every 
nation, however barbarous, has numbers of stories that have 
been handed down from the infancy of the race; and no 
matter how enlightened a people may become, the love for 
good stories grows no less. Hence to be able to write or tell 
good stories is an accomplishment that wins recognition at 
once and everywhere. 
There are certain essential features which one must observe 
in order to construct interesting stories. These are— 
1. The setting.—The writer should, at the beginning, or 
very near it, make known to the reader (1) the place, (2) the 
time, and (3) the characters with which the story deals. 
This will not only call for more or less description, but 
will require enough detail so that the pictures passing before 
the mind of the writer may be received by the reader also. 
The mind of the reader may be thought of as a great sheet, 
upon which clear or indistinct images are thrown by the 
‘narrator; for he manipulates the light and is responsible for 
the result. ‘
-P-A-G-E-202
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 183 
Examples of proper and faulty settings will be given later. 
2. The Main Incident.—Just as description has some 
particular effect that is to be produced, so a story, if effective, 
turns upon one main incident, or climax. The minor features 
of the story all tend towards this climax, which should stand 
out with its full emphasis and importance. 
After the climax of the story has been passed, very little 
more should be written—only enough to answer necessary 
questions about the “loose ends” of the narrative. 
All this implies that the writer of the story should know 
what his story is to be when he begins to write. He is then 
able to distinguish minor details from the main features of 
the action, and thus cause the climax to gather force and 
distinction. It is needless to say, therefore, that an outline 
is necessary at the outset in order to insure the proper 
building of a story. 
3. Conversation.—Much is lost from a story if there is 
Jack of conversation—of conversation that is natural and 
fits the quality of the story. A narrative in which persons 
are only talked about all the time is much less interesting 
than one in which the characters frequently speak for them- 
selves. 
The following selection illustrates the features of narration: 
PHOTOGRAPHING A ‘‘RHINO.” 
Regarded merely as a matter of sport, hunting with a camera is 
incomparably better than hunting solely to kill, although it may some- 
times happen that, in order to save his own life, the photographer is 
forced to shoot. An instance of this sort happened to a writer in Every- 
body's Magazine. He and his party were stalking ‘rhinos.’ Although 
the wind was in their favor, they had to use extreme care, because they 
must cross 2 bare, open stretch of ground, utterly lacking in cover. They 
were crawling as quietly as possible, when they suddenly discovered a 
third rhino almost directly down-wind, and only a little more than a 
hundred yards away. 
“A few steps farther, and the wind would have given him our scent
-P-A-G-E-203
184 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
—a hint the gentleman would possibly hail by charging upon us full 
tilt. This would have placed us between two fires, between him and the 
other two, in case they did not run; and hardly relishing the idea, we 
turned and crawled the other way. Once out of range of his nose, 
however, we turned, and with the telephoto lens I took a number of 
pictures at long range. 
“In the midst of this, we were delighted to sce the old boy get ready 
for his noonday nap. First of all, he began turning in his tracks just 
as a dog will do, sniffing at the ground about him. Then, when he had 
made sure it was to his liking, he finally laid himself down. Nothing 
  could have been more satisfactory, and exercising every caution, we 
moved forward until we were within twenty yards of the huge, uncon- 
scious slumberer. 
“Our hearts were beating as if to break when we stood up and gazed 
at him, for we fully expected a sudden and dangerous charge. Clark, 
who stood beside me, held the big rifle ready for instant use, while I 
trained the camera on our friend. For some seconds—they seemed like 
hours then—we stood absolutely quiet, making no sound, although we 
trembled with excitement. The rhino, however, still slept on, breathing 
as peacefully, although not quite so beautifully, as a child, and utterly 
oblivious of the presence of his enemy—man. Then, when we could 
endure the suspense no longer, I called aloud to him, ‘Come on, there!’ : 
“Never was an order more promptly and explicitly obeyed. At the 
sound of my voice he was up like a flash. One look showed him where 
we stood; he emitted a petulant snort, raised his waving tail, and— 
came. 
“To stand and focus the lens on him was not so easy as it sounds, 
If you have ever by chance stood directly in front of an oncoming ex.
-P-A-G-E-204

press, you can imagine a part of the feeling. On the big brute came; 
bigger and bigger he grew on the camera’s ground-glass screen. I dared 
not remove my eyes from it for fear of losing the focus; and so I stood 
till it seemed as if the beast were ready to step on me. 
“When I thought he was about to stick his horn through the camera 
and all, I released the catch of the shutter, and there I had him! 
“The click of the shutter was the signal for Clark to do his part. At 
the moment our friend was aimed head-on towards us. But Clark fired— 
rather gladly, too,—and at the shock of the bullet the rhino turned 
aside. He was so close, however, that although he sheered off abruptly, 
he passed not more than a dozen feet away.”

LESSON 220. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
The normal order of the sentence places the subject first, 
then its modifiers; next the predicate, then its object or 
complement, and finally the adverbial words, phrases or 
clauses modifying the predicate. 
Some of these elements almost always remain in the normal 
order—the adjectives, phrases, and clauses modifying the 
subject. Other parts, however, are freely changed with a 
desire for variety of expression; such are the direct object, 
complements, and adverbial modifiers of several kinds. . 
, Examples of such inverted order are— 
1. Three times a day the beautiful tolling of the Angelus is ‘heard. 
(Adverbial objective.) 
2. In the distance is the church steeple, towering above the horizon, 
and in it the bell is now tolling. (Adverb phrase.) 
3. There the two lived, never to be separated. (Adverb.) 
4. In the early times, before coal was discovered, wood was used for 
cooking and heating. (Adverb phrase and clause.) 
5. This the Israelites agreed to. (Object of preposition.) 
Exercise 1.—Point out the inversions in the following

Once a king was counting his gold. A fairy came and asked him 
what he had rather have than anything else. He said, ‘I had rather 
have everything I touch turn into gold.” _He went to dinner, and every- 
thing he touched turned into gold. His little girl was crying. He ran 
to see what was the matter. He touched her and she turned to gold. 
The fairy came. He told her he wanted his little girl back. She told 
him to get a pitcher and go down to the river and get some water, and 
sprinkle it on her. He did this and got his little girl back. So he was 
happy. . 
Exercise 2.—Direction as in Exercise 1: 
David was the son of Jesse. David was a little shepherd, and he

never to be afraid. The Philistines were their enemies, and they had 
a huge giant. His arms were as big as the trunk of a tree. He told the 
king of Israel to send out twenty of his men and he would kill them. 
King Saul sent out twenty men, and the giant killed them. Somebody 
heard David say that he would fight the giant, and told King Saul

armor, and the King of Israel begged David to put on his suit of armor, 
but David would not do it. David went out to fight the giant. Every- 
thing about the giant was covered with armor but a little space cut in 
there for him to see out of. David came through a field and saw some 
pebbles. He got around one. Goliath wouldn't fight David. David 
took his sling and put his round stone in it, and slung it at Goliath and

LESSON 226. 
THE COMMA—ADDITIONAL USES. 
In Lesson 112 of Part I, in connection with the study of 
simple sentences, several uses of the comma were considered; 
namely, with introductory and independent words and 
phrases, intermediate expressions, apposition, direct address, 
and a series in the same construction. 
Other uses may now be added, since complex and com- 
pound sentences have been studied. It will be found that 
the use of the comma, particularly, depends upon the gram-" 
matical relation of the parts of the sentence. 
1. Out of the north end of the lower lake, which is a huge sink 
in the mountains, the Ausable breaks its rocky barriers. 
Here the clause which is a huge sink in the mountains 
is not really necessary to the meaning of its antecedent; it 
might easily be omitted without obscuring the sentence; it 
does not restrict its antecedent, or tie the antecedent to it. 
Hence it is called an unrestrictive relative clause, and is set 
off by commas. 
2. The one trout in my basket was no burden, and I stepped lightly 
out. 
This is a compound sentence whose two clauses, or mem- 
bers, are short and closely connected. Neither member is 
subdivided by commas for any of the reasons previously 
given, hence the two members are separated from each other 
by commas. 
3, 4. I thought, as I stumbled along in the dismal actuality, that 
if I ever got out of it I would write a letter to the newspapers, 
exposing the whole thing.
-P-A-G-E-213
192 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Just as words and phrases may come between subject and 
predicate, or between predicate and object, so the adverbial 
clause as I stumbled along in the dismal actuality is inter= 
mediate between the predicate thought and the object-clause 
that I would write, etc. 
Also, the participial phrase exposing the whole thing is cut 
off by a comma because it is unrestrictive. 
(Note.—A participial phrase is a phrase introduced by a 
participle—that is, a verbal word ending in ing, ed, t, etc., 
and used as a loose adjective modifier.) 
5. How long I kept this course, and how far I went on, I do not 
know. 
Here two noun clauses, objects of do not know, are inverted 
and placed at the beginning of the sentence. * 
6. The higher the civilization has risen, the more abject is the 
desolation of barbarism that ensues. 
‘When an adverbial clause of degree is introduced by the 
word the, it comes first in the sentence and is usually followed 
by the comma to separate it from the independent clause. 
7. As I have been out of the city, I could not write sooner. 
A dependent clause of reason introduced by as—which 
is a favorite with young writers, especially in letters— 
should always be cut off from the rest of the sentence by 
@ comma. 
8. ‘‘That’s a wildcat,” said the guide. 
A complete direct quotation forming a part of a sentence 
is set off by a comma unless formally introduced. 
But if the quotation is incomplete and used merely as one 
element of the sentence, it needs no comma; for example, 
“The ‘rapture on the lonely shore’ is agreeable only when 
you can at any moment go home.”

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 193 
9. Dreadful stories they were; about hanging, and walking the 
plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild 
deeds and places on the Spanish Main. 
In this sentence, the expressions about hanging, and walk- 
ing the plank, etc., have a common dependence upon the 
clause, ‘“Dreadful stories they were.” Hence they are sepa- 
tated from each other by commas and from the governing 
clause by a semicolon.

this lesson, punctuating them correctly.

3. I confidently pursued this course, and went gayly on by the

blankets be passed out.

USES OF THE SEMICOLON. 
In general, the semicolon marks greater divisions in the 
sentence than the comma. One use was shown in number 
g of Lesson 226. Others are as follows:

blue strip of it I could see overhead.

When the members of a compound sentence are subdivided 
by commas, they are separated from each other by semi- 
colons. 
2. I was safe; I knew where I was; and I could have walked till 
morning. . 
When short members of a compound sentence require 
special emphasis or attention, even if they are not subdivided. 
by commas, semicolons are used to separate them. 
& The doe went on: she left the saw-mill on John’s brook to her 
right; she turned into a woodpath.” 
When several members of a compound sentence have a 
common dependence, in sense, upon a general clause they 
are separated from each other by semicolons, and from the 
general clause by a colon. 
Exercise 1.—Analyze in full the sentences quoted above. 
Exercise 2.—-Give first the reason for each comma, then for 
each semicolon in the following sentences: 
1. It was not possible to climb out of the gorge; it was impossible

bed, over the falls, and through the flumes, was not easy. 
2. There is a splendid city on the plain; there are temples and thea- 
tres on the hills; the commerce of the world seeks its port; 
the luxury of the Orient flows through its marble streets. 
3: Climbing out of the ravine was, in most places, simply impossible; 
and I began to look with interest for a slide, where bushes 
rooted in the scant earth would enable me to scale the preci- 
pice. 
4. This dryness has its advantages: the walking is improved; the 
waters of the streams, though scant and clear, are cold as ice; 
the common forest chill is gone from the air.

nothing alarming in the situation, since I knew. exactly

LESSON 232. 
USES OF THE COLON. 
_ One use of the colon has been given in number 3, Lesson 
231. Another use was given in Lesson 60, Part I (salutation 
in a letter). 
Other uses of the colon are as follows: 
1. (a) I prefer the rifle: it makes a clean job of death, and does not 
prematurely stuff the bird with globules of lead. 
(6) That I did not come to any opening or path, only showed that 
I had slightly mistaken the distance: I was going in the right 
direction. 
In each of these sentences a complete statement is made, 
then another independent clause is added to accompany it, 
but no conjunction is expressed. In (a), for is understood; 
‘in (b), nevertheless would be the proper conjunction. 
Sometimes the added clause is in the same line of thought; 
sometimes in opposition to the first; again it may be only 
a repetition of the same thought in other words. 
2. When I had gone half a mile, my opinion of the character of the 
pools was unchanged: never were there such places for trout; 
but the trout were out of their places. 
In this sentence the clauses, “never were there such places 
for trout,” and “but the trout were out of their places,” are 
separated from each other by a semicolon. Then in order to 
show the relation of these to the first member of the sentence, 
the two latter are separated from the first by a colon. 
In sense, though not grammatically, the first clause bal- 
ances the other two. If the relation could be expressed in 
figures it would be, one-half equals one-fourth plus one- 
fourth. Hence the colon follows the weightier clause, and 
a semicolon stands between the two lesser ones.

Here the direct quotation is formally introduced; that 
is, the words a sentence look forward to the quotation and 
prepare the way for it. In such a case the colon is used. 
Quotations are formally introduced also by such expres- 
sions as these words, this remark, the following question, as 
follows, the following words, etc. 
Exercise.—Write from dictation the sentences quoted 
above, punctuating them correctly. 
LESSON 233. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
Notice the italicized words in the following sentences: 
1. He returned to England on receiving an invitation from the 
Earl of Leicester. 
2, If you drop your line in among these logs after clambering out 
on them to the centre of the stream, you are sure to finda perch, 
In sentence 1, the phrase on receiving takes the place of 
the clause ‘when he received;’’ in sentence 2, the phrase 
after clambering takes. the place of the clause “after you 
have clambered.”’ . 
The verbal words, such as receiving and clambering, which 
are used as objects of prepositions, subjects and objects of 
verbs, etc., and at the same time take their own objects 
and modifiers, are called gerunds. ; 
An occasional change from the infinitive or the dependent 
clause to the gerund phrase will be a gain in variety and 
smoothness. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, change the italicized 
expressions to gerund phrases: 
1. If these countries had preserved one-tenth of a square mile of Jand 
for forests, they would now have a larger population. 
2. This canal is doing more business to-day than any other canal 
in the world because large iron and copper mines have been opened

alone, the lion set him free. 
LESSON 234. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
Now and then a little touch of animation as well as variety 
may be imparted to a composition by the use of an exclama= 
tory or an interrogative sentence. The exclusive use of 
statements may become monotonous, but the question or 
the exclamation should be very sparingly used to relieve the 
monotony. ‘ 
In fact, none of the means of variety should be used often 
enough to attract attention as being forced and unnatural: 
smoothness and naturalness should be the aim. 
The following are examples of exclamations in compo- 
sitions. One story begins with the sentence, 
“Oh, what a fine day for a drive!" exclaimed Sue. 
A description ends with the sentence, 
“How peaceful it all seemed out there in the country!” 
Exercise 1.—Change the following sentences to the exclam- 
atory or the interrogative form: 
(a) When they reached home, Clara’s mother said Dash was a brave 
dog.

(2) I consider a comfortable, happy, and peaceful home as being the 
most precious of all earthly things, 
(c) A few drops pattered against the window, and then the rain came 
down in torrents. 
(d) It was a calm April day, and everything looked peaceful. 
(e) The sound of the horse’s hoofs on the hard pike caused much 
excitement. 
Exercise 2.—Rewrite the following paragraph so as to 
introduce interrogative and exclamatory sentences wheré 
they will be effective: 
At last Orpheus came in front of Pluto, the god of the Lower World, 
and his wife Proserpine, who told Orpheus one condition on which 
Eurydice could go back to him again. That was for him to go out of 
Hades playing and singing, and not to look back to see if Eurydice was 
following until he had passed the gates of Hades. Orpheus was over- 
joyed, and went out playing a merry tune. He walked on and on, won- 
dering if Eurydice was following. He heard footsteps behind him. 
At last he saw the snow-capped mountains of the upper world. For- 
getting he had not yet passed the gates of Hades, he turned to clasp 
Eurydice once more, but alas! he saw her just fading in the distance, 
a pale ghost again.

LESSON 240. 
VARIETY OF STRUCTURE. 
In narration, much is added to the sprightliness of the 
story by the use of direct quotations. Of course, an occa- 
sional remark or question may be indirect, but any con- 
versation should be quoted in exact, direct words. Com- 
pare these two selections: 
1. Once a little ant fell into the water and cried for help. A little 
dove near by heard the cries and resolved to drop a leaf into the water 
so that the ant could get on it and float ashore. The little ant thanked 
the dove because she had saved its life. 
Not long after, the dove was building her nest when all at once a 
hunter appeared. Seeing the dove, he lifted his gun to shoot her. The 
little ant saw the hunter, and said she would save the dove. It ran up . 
and bit the hunter on the heel, making the man drop his gun. The noise 
made the dove take wing, and thus the ant saved the dove’s life.

He said he would give King Midas a wish. King Midas wished that 
everything he touched would turn to gold. 
The next morning he was up early. He began to put on his clothes, 
and they turned to gold. He ran out into the garden and touched the 
roses, and they turned to gold. His little girl cried because her roses 
were turned to gold. Her father heard her crying and went to her and 
said, “These will never fade, my little girl.” 
King Midas kissed her, and she turned to gold. Midas screamed for 
Mercury to take away the golden touch. Mercury told him to run and 
jump into the river, and bring a pitcher of water back and sprinkle it 
upon his little girl’s head. King Midas did so. The little girl said, 
“Father, why are you spoiling my new dress?” 
Midas was very glad to hear his little girl speak again. He said he 
did not want. to see any more gold.

LESSON 241. 
VERBS—DISTINGUISHED FROM VERBALS. 
The verb, the asserting word of the sentence, has been 
met with in every sentence heretofore analyzed. But some 
words of caution may well be dwelt upon in this lesson.
-P-A-G-E-225
204 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
First, a verb may be one word, or two, three, or even 
four words all forming a unit; for example: 
I had given him the medicine. 
Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor. 
The buccaneers could have been heard running away. 
Second, verbs should not be confused with verbals. These 
are derivatives of verbs: they express action or state just 
as verbs do; they take direct objects, modifiers, etc., as 
verbs do; but they are not used as predicates. 
Hence the test in any case of doubt is, to see whether the 
word in question has a subject: if so, it is a verb; if not, it 
it is only a verbal. 
Exercise.—Distinguish the verbs from the verbals in the 
following paragraphs, and give the subject of each verb: 
1. When I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note ad- 
dressed to John Silver, at the sign of the “Spy-glass,” and told 
me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks 
and keeping a bright look-out for a little tavern with a large 
brass telescope for a sign. I set off, overjoyed at the opportunity 
to see more of the ships and seamen, and picked my way among 
a great crowd of people and carts and bales, for the dock was now 
at its busiest, until I found the tavern in question. 
2. As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance 
I was sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close 
by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which 
he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it 
like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a 
ham. He seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he 
moved about among the tables. 
LESSON 242. 
AUXILIARY AND PRINCIPAL VERBS. 
Examine the following sentences: 
x. The captain had been struck dead by apoplexy. 
2. A full moon was beginning to rise.
-P-A-G-E-226
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 205 
3. We slipped along the hedges, nor did we see anything to increase 
our terrors. 
4. Will you give me your hand, my kind young friend? 
In these sentences, the words struck, beginning, see, and 
give contain the verb idea, but they cannot make an assertion 
without the helping words had been, was, did, and will. 
The words struck, beginning, see, and give are called prin= 
cipal verbs because they define the meaning, and undergo 
changes according to what helping words are used: as, 
I have given; We did not give. 
The words had been, was, did, and will are called auxiliary 
verbs, or auxiliaries, because they help the principal verb 
in making the various kinds of assertions. 
The most common auxiliaries are be (with its forms am, 
are, is, was, were, have been, had been, will be, shall be, shall 
or will have been), have (with has, had), shall or will, do 
(with does, did). 
Others classed as auxiliaries, but not of quite the same 
kind, are may, might, can, could, would, should, must, and 
ought. - 
Note that the forms of be, have and do are frequently 
used also as principal verbs, with their own auxiliaries. 
. Exercise.—Distinguish auxiliaries from principal verbs 
among the italicized words in the following sentences:   
1. The expression of his face was not at all pleasant. 
2. We were both hidden by the open door. 
3- All the blood had gone out of his face, and even his nose was 
blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost. 
4. I certainly did my best to listen. 
5. If you don't break off you'll die—do you understand that? 
6. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as 
I told you.

SHORT AND LONG SENTENCES. 
Exercise 1.—Rewrite the following composition, combin- 
ing groups of short sentences into longer, smoother sentences: 
After a while Robertson said he was going back to tell of his fortune. 
This he did. He started back, and after a few days’ travel he got lost. 
Day after day he became weaker, as his provisions had given out. It 
rained. The powder was wet, and was no longer good. He tried to 
shoot with it, but in vain. 
Finally he lay down to die. He heard a horn blow. Directly he 
heard the sound of a horse’s feet. Then two huntsmen came in sight. 
Robertson’s cry for help could not be heard. The huntsmen rode on 
by. Presently the horse of one of the men stumbled over the tired, 
weak body. The man looked around and said, ‘Oh, here is a man from 
North Carolina dead!” They picked him up and gave him food and 
drink. This strengthened Robertson, then he went on home. 
Exercise 2.—Follow the direction in Exercise 1 in rewriting 
the following composition: 
Once upon a time there lived a man named Job. He lived in Uz. 
He was very rich. He had cattle and sheep and camels by the thousands. 
He had daughters and sons. 
Job was also as good as he was rich. One day God said to Satan, 
“Do you know what a faithful servant I have?’’ And Satan said, ‘‘No 
wonder he is so good. He has all the cattle he wants, and riches.’’ 
“Go and take all the cattle and camels away from him,”’ said God. 
One nian came to Job and said, ‘All your cattle are dead.” Another 
man said, ‘Your children were in a house when a wind came and killed 
them.” Then Job said, ‘God giveth and God taketh. Blessed is the

LESSON 246. 
‘TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS. 
In Lesson 37 were found many verbs that do-not take 
direct objects, but subjective complements. In Lessons 
32, 36, and 42, Part I, were found many verbs that take direct 
objects, some of them with objective complements. ‘These 
should be reviewed, and lists again made as directed in 
those lessons. 
A transitive verb is one that requires a direct object to 
complete its meaning. 
An intransitive verb is one that does not require a. direct 
object to complete its meaning. 
The word transitive is. from the Latin transire,, which 
means to go over: when the transitive verb ‘is used, the- 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
208 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
action goes over from the subject to the object; ‘as, “Nature 
provides no shelter against her storms.’ The object may be 
a whole clause. 
When the intransitive verb is used, the action does not 
go over to an object: either the verb is complete in itself, 
or it is completed by a noun or adjective (subjective) com- 
plement; for example, “Holy men in their youth had slept 
and studied and prayed there.”-—‘'The Old Manse had grown 
sacred.” 
Remember, intransitive means not going over; no direct 
object. * 
Exercise.—Mention the transitive verbs in the following 
sentences, after giving the direct object of each; mention 
the intransitive verbs, giving the complement of each, if 
any is used: 
1. I had never seen the squire so near at hand. 
2. He was a tall man, over six feet high, and he had a bluff, rough- 
and-ready face. 
. The doctor opened the seals with great care. 
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. 
As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room.

CONVERSATION. 
The value of conversation in a story has been frequently 
emphasized in preceding lessons. It adds a directness and 
animation that a good story can ill spare; it makes the reader 
~ feel that he is present in person. 
Conversation should, in the first place, be appropriate 
to the speaker: a street boy should not be made to talk 
like a philosopher, nor a minister like a cowboy. Goldsmith 
made a just criticism of Dr. Johnson when he said, “You 
would make all the little fishes talk like whales.” 
Second, the words used in conversation may indicate the 
character of the person who is speaking—whether good- 
natured, or gloomy, or happy, or dejected, or bold, or timid, 
or nervous, or treacherous, or crafty, etc. The business of 
’ the narrator is to tell the story: he does not wish to analyze 
the disposition of this person or that; hence he depends 
upon the conversation to serve this purpose. 
Third, conversation may gain or lose much of its force 
according to the verbs used in introducing it. If every remark 
on a page began or ended with “I said,” ‘“‘he said,” “said I,” 
“said he,” the quotations would become monotonous instead 
of spirited. Some of the verbs that may well be used may 
be taken from a page or two of “Treasure Island,” written 
by Robert Louis Stevenson: 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  “ ?” T asked. “ 2” T told him. 
“ ;” he answered. “—_____.”” says he, quite pleased 
. apparently. 
“———" T cried. “ 2?” he asked. 
“(__ said he. “ ,”’ I answered. 
“ ,” he continued. “ ,” said he. 
“___ said T. “« 2” he gasped. “—____.” he repeated. “ ?” T asked, 
\____,” -was my reply. “«______ returned Ben Gunn. 
  
  “ !” he cried. “ ?” he added, with a look 
of great shrewdness.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE. 
Compare the verbs in these two sentences: 
1. A priest had built the Old Manse. 
2. The Old Manse had been built by a priest. 
In sentence 1, the subject priest is represented as acting, 
and the action is exerted upon the direct object, the Old 
Manse. The verb had built is said to be in the active voice. 
In sentence 2, the subject, the Old Manse, represents the 
thing acted upon—that which was the object with the active 
verb has now become the subject. The agent, or person 
acting, is placed in a phrase introduced by the preposition 
by (but the agent is not expressed in all sentences). The 
verb had been built is said to be in the passive voice. :
-P-A-G-E-235
212 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Voice is that inflection of a transitive verb which indicates 
whether the subject acts or is acted upon. 
The active voice is that form of a transitive verb that 
represents the subject as the doer of the action. 
The passive voice is that form of a transitive verb that 
represents the subject as the thing acted upon. 
Exercise.—In each of the sentences below, (1) find the 
stibject of the verb; (2) see whether it names the doer or 
the receiver of the action; (3) tell.the voice of each verb:

The scarecrow represented a fine geritleman. 
The coal was brought by an invisible hand.

TENSE. 
Notice the verbs in the following sentences: 
1. You have conquered, and I yield. : 
2. No one will ever know what my feelings were at this moment, 
These verbs do not indicate the same time. The word 
yield expresses a simple action in present time; have conquered 
indicates action completed somewhere within the range of 
the present; will know indicates action somewhere in future 
time; and were indicates a simple past condition. 
‘There are really only three divisions of time: present,
-P-A-G-E-236
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 218 
past, and future: all action or condition must-bein one ‘of 
these.’ 
Tense is that form of the verb that indicates the time of 
the action or being. 
-.- Within each of the divisions of time; however, action or 
being may be variously represented; the forms being simple, 
progressive, and perfect. : 
For example, the tenses of the verb walk: 
Present 
Past 
Future 
  Simple. I walk, you walk, he walks, we walk, 
they walk. : 
Progressive. I am walking, you are walking, he is

Perfect. I have walked, you have walked, he has 
walked, etc. 
Perfect progressive. Ihave been walking, you have 
been walking, he has been walking, etc. 
Simple. TI walked, you walked, he walked, | we 
walked, etc. : 
Progressive. Iwas walking, you were walking, etc. 
Perfect. I had walked, you had walked, he had 
walked, etc. 
Perfect progressive. I had been walking, you had 
been walking, he had been walking, etc. 
Simple. I shall walk, you will walk, he will walk, 
etc. . 
Progressive. I-shall be walking, you will be walking,

Perfect progressive. Ushall have been walking, you 
will have been walking, he. will have been

The simple present tense expresses action indefinitely in 
present time. 
The present progressive tense expresses action continuing 
in present time. 
The present perfect tense expresses action as completed 
somewhere within the range of present time. 
The present perfect progressive tense expresses continued 
action within present time which had its beginning in past 
time. 
The simple past tense expresses action indefinitely in 
past time. . 
The past progressive tense expresses action continuing 
in past time. 
The past perfect tense expresses action in past time com- 
pleted before some other action in past time. 
The past perfect progressive tense expresses continued 
action in the past as completed before some other action 
in past time. 
The simple future tense expresses action indefinitely in 
future time. 
The future progressive tense expresses action continuing 
in future time. 
The future perfect tense expresses action in future time 
as to be completed before some other action in future time. 
The future perfect progressive tense expresses continued 
action in future time as completed before some other action 
in future time.

The pioneers were a hard-working, resolute set of people. When 
they came into the wilderness, they expected to endure hardships and 
they did endure them. When they reached the place that they wished 
to make their home, the men and boys cut down trees and split logs so 
as to build their houses. They held the logs together by weight-poles, 
for they had no nails. They came into the wilderness by means of 
pack-horses. When the men and boys had built their houses, they 
made the furniture. They made some strong bedsteads and benches. 
Such things as carpets and mirrors and many other things were unknown 
to the pioneers. The men then employed the best mechanic they could 
find to make their wives and daughters a spinning-wheel. The men 
cleared a spot to raise their crop. The women and girls had to make 
* all the clothes out of flax and wool. They had to raise it and then spin 
it into cloth and then make the clothes. Wild game furnished their 
meat, and maple sap their sugar. They got water from natural springs, 
and did all their cooking on the fireplace.

He stayed seven years begging for money. The queen gave him money 
enough to buy three ships. So he bought the ships. Then he got some 
sailors to go with him and when they were in the middle of. the ‘sea,

(6) Now come, my child, and tel me all about it. 
In the first group of sentences, a question and an answer

as a fact: such verbs are said to be in the indicative mood. 
In the second group, the verbs in (a) express a sharp com- 
mand, while those in (b) express a gentle, kind request, or 
entreaty: such verbs are said to be in the imperative mood.

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 219 
Mood is the form or use of the verb that indicates the 
manner in which the action or being is regarded. 
The indicative mood is the form or use of a verb which 
represents action or being as a fact. 
The imperative mood is that form or use of a verb which 
expresses a command, a request, or an entreaty. 
Many of these verbs have been met with in the study of 
declarative and imperative sentences (Lesson 7 and following, 
Part I). 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, point out the verbs 
in the indicative mood and those in the imperative mood—

LESSON 266. 
SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD. 
A thought may be put in the form of a statement of fact; 
as, 
(a) It was raining, therefore we remained at home. 
Or the same thought may be put into the form of a mere 
supposition which does not regard the fact at all, but only 
presents to one’s mind an idea suspended, as it were; for 
example, 
(b) If it had not rained, we should not have remained at home. - 
A statement rests upon solid fact, and the statement of 
fact may be represented by a solid line, thus— 
(©) The problem is hard, but we must solve it. 
In this statement and in (a), the verbs are in the indicative 
mood. 
But an idea merely conceived of in the mind does not rest 
upon fact; it rests only upon a baseless supposition. Such 
an idea may be represented by a dotted line, thus— 
(a) “If the problem had not been hard, we could have solved it easily.” 
In (0) and (d) the verbs are said to be in the subjunctive 
mood. 
The subjunctive mood is the form or use of a verb that 
represents an idea as merely conceived of in the mind. 
Other examples to show the indicative and the subjunctive 
way of regarding thoughts may be added:

  2. The ice was thick, so we went skating. 
If my friend were not here, we would go calling. 
3. My friend is here; we will not go calling. 
It will be noticed that sentence (b) is opposite, or contrary 
to the fact in (a); so (d) is contrary to the fact in (c). Yet 
the underlying idea in (b) is the same as that in (a); so that 
in (d) is the same as that in (c). 
Compare the two lines in 2 and those in 3 similarly. 
Exercise 1.—Write the fact which is the contrary of the 
supposition or wish in each of the following sentences: 
1, If Robinson Crusoe had followed his father’s advice, he would

contempt of every patriotic American. 
4. We can claim a reward, for we have done our whole duty. 
LESSON 267. 
USES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.                                    
The subjunctive mood is not used so much at present as it 
was formerly, for instance, when the King James version 
of the Bible was made. Nor is the subjunctive mood used
-P-A-G-E-248
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 225 
so much in English as it is in Latin and some other languages. 
Four.uses of the subjunctive mood, however, are common 
in modern English: 
1. To express a wish, the thing wished for being in an 
independent clause, as in the sentence,“‘God be praised! She 
has come again!’ 
More often the thing wished for is in the dependent clause 
after the verb wish, or would (meaning ‘I wish’’), etc.; as, 
“T wish we could only be perfectly sure that the grandmother 
is still alive.” 
2. Ina supposition contrary to fact, the verb in the depend- 
ent clause and that in the independent both being in the 
subjunctive mood; as sentences (b) and (d) in Lesson 266, 
and others. 
3. In an ideal condition; not quite the same as supposition 
contrary to fact, since nothing is implied as to the fact, or 
whether the condition will be fulfilled; for example, “If the 
robber-bird should fly over Frankfort he would scream still 
louder.” In this condition the action is regarded as future, 
though the form of both verbs is really of the past tense. 
4. In a purpose clause, introduced by so that, that, or lest, 
the clause that expresses the thing desired or avoided having 
the subjunctive verb; as, “Heidi would put both hands over 
her eyes, so that she might not see the sunlight on the walls 
opposite.” ‘ 
Exercise.—Pick out the verbs in the subjunctive mood in 
the sentences below, giving the exact use of each: 
1. “Oh, Heavens!” sounded from the corner. ‘‘Ah, how I wish I 
could have her with me once more while I live!” 
2. If you should not be able to deal with the child alone, you might 
have my mother’s assistance. 
3. “Then God help you!” said the pastor, and went sadly out of

LESSON 271. 
CORRECT USE OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD. 
There are certain differences in form between the indicative 
and the subjunctive mood which should be learned (observe 
the form that accompanies the subject in cach instance): 
Active Voice. 
SIMPLE PAST TENSE (of the verb de). 
Indicative. Subjunctive. 
1st person singular. I was. (If) I were. 
3d person singular. He was. (If) he were. 
SIMPLE PAST TENSE (verb drive). 
1st person singular. I drove. (If) I drove, should 
drive, or were to 
drive. 
3d person singular. He drove. (If) he drove, . should 
drive, or were to 
drive. 
PAST TENSE PROGRESSIVE (verb drive). 
ist person singular. Iwas driving. (If) I were driving. 
3d person singular. He was driving. (If) he were driving.
-P-A-G-E-253
228 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Passive Voice. 
SIMPLE PAST TENSE (verb drive). 
Indicative. Subjunctive. 
rst person singular. Iwasdriven. (If) I were driven. 
3d person singular. He was driven. (If) he were driven. 
PAST TENSE PROGRESSIVE (verb drive). 
ist person singular. I was being (If) I were being driven. 
driven. : 
3d person singular. He was being (If) he were being driven. 
driven. 
In brief, the forms to watch are: was in the singular num- 
ber of the indicative past, whether a principal verb or an 
auxiliary; and were in the singular number of the subjunctive 
past, whether a principal verb or an auxiliary. 
These are forms that every cultivated person is expected 
to use thoughtfully; and an error in the use of them is 
regarded as inexcusable. , 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, choose the proper 
form to fill each blank, giving a good reason for your choice: 
1. If he (was, were) to learn that I am to marry his father, he would 
move heaven and earth to prevent the marriage. 
2. I wish I (was, were) able to tell the whole story. 
3. If Nicholas (was, were) here, he would not permit this delay. 
4. It was certainly a bitter thought that she (was, were) to take the 
place of the mother whom he tenderly remembered. 
5. He would willingly run the risk of being laughed at if only he 
(was, were) able to rid himself of his dread. 
6. Oh, if my father (was, were) able to tell me all! 
7. Perhaps she would be more careful if she (was, were) writing 
so important a letter. 
8. I would give you the information if your question (was, were) 
of a proper character.

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 229 
LESSON 272. 
AGREEMENT OF VERB AND SUBJECT. 
In using a predicate verb, one should give careful attention 
to the nature of the subject. This is particularly important 
in English, because the form of the subject is not regarded 
so much as its meaning in determining whether the predicate 
verb shail be singular or plural. Consequently it is only in 
a certain sense that one can follow the rule that ‘The verb 
agrees with its subject in person and number.” 
The following constructions require special care: 
I. Singular Predicate. 
1. The singular predicate is often used with a subject 
that is plural in form but singular in meaning; as, 
Unpleasant news has come from the old home. 
Physics is a hard study when the problems are required. 
2. Two singular subjects connected by and are followed 
by a singular predicate when they name the same object 
or parts of the same combination; for example: 
The secretary and treasurer has not signed the check. 
The block and tackle was used to hoist the steel girders. 
3. Two or more singular subjects connected by the con- 
junctions either, or, and subjects preceded by the adjectives 
many a, each, every, and no are followed by a singular predi- 
cate; as, 
Either corn or wheat is a paying crop on such land. 
Every man, woman, and child was crowding to the windows. 
Note.—Words connected by neither, nor are usually 
included under the same rule, but good writers use the 
plural perhaps as often as the singular after subjects con- 
nected by these conjunctions.
-P-A-G-E-255
230 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
4. A collective noun which is regarded as naming a group 
of things taken as a unit is followed by a singular verb; as, 
The committee was appointed as soon as possible. 
TI. Plural Predicate. 
1. Two or more nouns connected by the conjunction and, 
and referring to distinct objects, are followed by a plural 
predicate; as, 
The lake and the forest were delightful to us. 
2. A collective noun naming a collection of which indi- 
viduals are thought of separately, is followed by a plural 
predicate; as, 
The committee were expressing their opinions freely before they 
should report on the matter. 
Some catttions on minor points should also be observed: 
(a) The pronoun you always takes a plural predicate. 
(0) The adjective pronouns any and none are usually 
regarded as plural. 
(c) The preposition with, joining two nouns, should not 
be confused with the conjunction and; for example, 
Tom Brown, with his two companions, was rapidly gaining ground. 
In this, and in the next two constructions, watch the real 
subject, not some accompnying word. 
(d) When two subjects are joined by as well as, the first 
is regarded as the real subject; as, 
The coachman, as well as the passengers, was eager for the hot 
breakfast. 
(e) When pronouns or nouns of more than one person 
precede the predicate, the real subject should not be con- 
fused with some accompanying word. Thus, in this sentence, 
Which one of you left your book in the window?
-P-A-G-E-256
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 231 
the real subject is one (third person), and not you; hence 
the correct form would be, 
Which one of you left his book in the window? 
Exercise.—Choose the correct form in each of the sen- 
tences below, giving beforehand your explanation of the 
relation between subject and predicate: 
1. Hard knocks and hard work (was, were) what they expected. 
2. The present generation (has, have) scarcely taken account of 
these quiet but noble families. 
3. We decided to cry quits before either one of us (was, were) ready 
to grumble at the other. 
4. Not one in twenty of you (knows, know) where to find the wood- 
sorrel, or what the wood-sage is good for. 
5. There (is, are) lots of waste ground by the side of the roads in 
every village, where (feeds, feed) the pigs and ganders of the 
people. 
6. East, as well as Tom, (was, were) annoyed at the pertness of

LESSON 276. 
DEFECTIVE VERBS. 
There is a small but exceedingly useful group of verbs 
commonly known as defective verbs. 
They are called defective verbs because none have more 
forms than present tense and past tense; some have only 
one form. 
In fact, however, they are auxiliary verbs; and when joined 
to infinitives of other verbs they form the present, present 
perfect, past, and past perfect tenses. Including the pro- 
gressive forms, the defective verbs thus have a number of
-P-A-G-E-258
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 233 
tenses; and since they vary in meaning they constitute a 
very valuable means of expression-in our language. 
To the pupil who intends to study other languages it is 
important to understand the forms and uses of these verbs. 
In the study of German (in which language the verbs are 
similarly compounded) it is particularly helpful to have 
mastered the English defective verbs. 
The defective auxiliaries are as follows: 
Simple form. Past form. Simple form. Past form. 
may might must — 
can could ought — 
(shall) should (will) “would 
Note.—Both must and ought are old past forms, but now’ 
used for present as well as past in combination with the simple 
infinitive. : 
When these are joined to infinitives (present, perfect, 
present progressive, and perfect progressive infinitives), 
they form all the simple, progressive, and perfect tenses of 
present and past time. (Shall and will are-regarded as always 
future auxiliaries.) 
The defective-auxiliary forms of the verb call are:.   
Active Voice. 
Present tense. Present tense, progressive: 
AUXILIARY. INFINITIVE. AUXILIARY. INFINITIVE.

may, can, etc. be called. might, could, etc. be called. 
Present perfect tense. Past perfect tense. 
may,can,etc. have been might, could, etc. have been 
called. called. 
There are no progressive forms in the passive voice. 
All these forms are in the indicative or the subjunctive 
mood according to use, in the same way as other verbs. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences give the voice and 
tense of each defective verb; and after studying the use of 
each in the sentence, give its mood: 
I. No one could do more work than he when I knew him. 
2. To Mime’s school, where he would be taught to work skillfully 
and to think wisely, Siegfried was sent. 
3. You hear how this boy can talk: we will see what he can do. 
_ 4. His coat of mail was so huge that twenty men of common mould 
might have found shelter under it. 
5. They would not have placed this treasure in the hands of any 
other person.

to. Idun would have been forgotten by all save her husband, had 
not the Asas begun to feel the need of her apples. 
LESSON 277. 
“SHALL” AND “WILL,” ‘SHOULD’? AND “ WOULD.” 
The auxiliaries shall and will, and their past tense forms 
should and would, must be carefully studied; because good 
usage requires that certain of these words accompany certain 
subjects according to the meaning of the sentence. 
Some of the rules are very loosely regarded by people 
generally in conversation, and too often in newspapers and 
periodicals; but no person pretending to education and cul- 
ture is excused for errors in the use of these auxiliaries. 
The most important of these rules are as follows: 
1. To express mere future action—a thing only expected 
but not under the control of the speaker—use shall with 
the first person and will with the second and third. 
MERE FUTURE ACTION. 
Singular. Plural. 
1. I shall call, be calling, be 1. We shall call, etc. 
called, have called, have 
been calling, have been ” 
called. . 
2. You will call, etc. 2. You will call, etc. 
3- He will call, etc. 3. They will call, etc. 
Should and would, when conditional, or when they stand 
for shall and will in indirect quotations, follow the same rule. 
2. To express intention or determination of the speaker, use 
will with the first person, and shall with the second and 
third.

INTENTION OR DETERMINATION.

x. I will call, be calling, be We will call, etc.

2. You shall call, etc. You shall call, etc. 
3. He shall call, etc. They shall call, etc. 
, EXCEPTIONS. 
1. In general, questions contain the same auxiliaries that 
would be expected in the answer; as, ‘“‘Shall you go?” 
(Answer, “I shall go,” or “I shall not go”’.) “Should you 
go if you were invited?” (Answer, “I should,” etc.) 
But the question, “Shall I go?’ means, ‘Do you wish me 
to go?” 
2. When a direct quotation is changed to indirect, the

There are two pairs of verbs that are likely to be confused; 
and here again no person pretending to culture can afford 
to be careless. 
They are ke and lay, sit and set. 
These differ not only in their meanirig, but also in their 
nature and forms. The principal forms of each of them are 
as follows:
-P-A-G-E-264
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 239 
Present tense. Past tense. 
3d person singular 
Lie lies 
Lay lays 
Sit sits 
Set sets 
Progressive tenses. 
Li (is, was, has been, 
had been) lying, ete. 
Lay (is, was) laying, etc. 
Sit (is, was) sitting, etc. 
Set (is, was) setting, etc. lay

sat 
set 
Perfect tenses. 
(has or had) lain, ete. 
(has or had) laid, etc. 
(has, had) sat, ete. 
(has, had) set, etc. 
The difference in nature is that Ke and sit are intransi- 
tive; lay and set are transitive. Lie and sit cannot take 
direct objects; lay and set are never used without direct 
objects (except when set has a different meaning). 
Lie means to rest, to recline; whereas lay means to put 
or place a thing down. 
Sit means to rest on a seat; whereas set means to place 
‘a thing in position. 
Examples of their use are as follows: 
1. They sat by the canal watching their little float. 
2. Tom had been sitting on the bench before the house. 
3. The guard picks him off and sets him on the ground. 
4. The baggage had been set down before the door of the inn. 
5. The old dog that had been lying by the door got up slowly.

LESSON 283. 
THE VALUE OF SYNONYMS. 
Sometimes a composition otherwise good suffers from 
too much repetition of one or two words. Perhaps it is a 
story about a boy: the word boy, boy, boy, is used until the 
monotony tells upon the patience of the reader. Turning 
to a good dictionary, the writer might find some useful 
synonyms to relieve the monotony—youth, urchin, stripling, 
lad, etc. Even one or two used with care will prevent the 
reader from tiring of too much sameness. 
As an example of the use of synonyms, Dickens in the 
“Christmas Carol’’ speaks of the ghost as follows in a page 
or. two: 
The Ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace. . . . 
The specire’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones... . 
“T do,” replied the Ghost. ... 
At this the spirit raised a frightful cry. . . 
The phantom taking off the bandage round his head, his lower jaw 
dropped down upon his breast! . 
“Mercy!” he said. |“ Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”
-P-A-G-E-266
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 241 
Exercise 1.—From the following paragraph select the 
synonyms used to describe the dreary schoolroom and to 
repeat the impression: 
I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me as the most 
forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now—a long room, 
with three long rows of desks and six of forms, and bristling all round 
with pegs for hats and slates. Scraps of old copybooks and exercises 
litter the dirty floor; some sillkworms’ houses, made of the same mate- 
tials, are scattered over the desks, two miserable little white mice, 
left behind by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle 
made of pasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red 
eyes for anything to eat. A bird, in a cage very little bigger than him- 
self, makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, 
two inches high, or dropping from it, but neither sings nor chirps. 
There is a strange, unwholesome smell upon the room, like mildewed 
corduroys, sweet apples wanting air, and rotten books. There could 
not well be more ink splashed about it, if it had been roofless from its 
first construction, and the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown 
ink through the varying seasons of the year. 
Exercise 2.—Rewrite the following paragraph, using 
synonyms instead of the expressions that are repeated: 
He spoke in a loud, insolent voice, and made fun of the God of the 
Israelites. David did not like to hear Goliath make fun of the God of 
the Israelites. The giant dared any one to come out and fight him. 
David went to Saul and asked him to let him fight Goliath. Saul said, 
“Go, and may God be with you.’”’ David took his staff and some smooth 
stones and went out to fight Goliath. When Goliath saw David he 
said, “Am I a dog that you come with a stick to beat me? Come:on, 
and I will give your body to the fowls of the air.’’

WEAK AND STRONG VERBS. 
Notice the difference between the following verbs, of 
which the principal forms, or principal parts, are given:

x. Call -called 
2. Buy bought 
3. Send sent 
4. Set set 
5. Begin . began

PRACTICAL ENGLISH 243 
Present participle. Perfect participle. 
(Basis of (Basis of perfect tenses 
progressive forms.) activeand all passive voice.) 
(is, was, etc.) calling. (have, had) called. 
(is, was, etc.) buying. (have, had) bought. 
(is, was, etc.) sending. (have, had) sent. 
(is, was, etc.) setting. (have, had) set. 
(is, was, etc.) beginning. (have, had) begun. 
Such verbs as call, which form the past tense and perfect 
participle by adding d or ed, are called weak verbs. 
Weak verbs include also such verbs as buy, which add the 
ending ¢ to form the past tense and perfect participle; also 
such verbs as send, which take the ending ¢ instead of d in 
the past tense and perfect participle; and, finally, such verbs 
as set, which add no ending, undergo no change at all, in the 
past tense and perfect participle. (Formerly these verbs 
did have an ending #e, but it has been lost.) 
Such verbs as begin, which change their vowel to form the 
past tense and perfect participle, but add no ending in the 
past tense, are called strong verbs. 
The term strong verb implies the power to form a past 
tense without adding an ending; the term weak verb implies 
the need of adding an ending to form the past tense. 
A weak verb is one that adds the ending d, ed, or t to form 
the past tense, or one that undergoes no change at all (in 
modern English) in forming the past tense. 
A strong verb is one that changes its vowel, but adds no 
ending, to form the past tense. 
The characteristic ending of the perfect participle of strong 
verbs is » or en, but many of the verbs have it now only in 
the adjective use of the participle; as, ‘‘a drunken man,” 
“a sunken log,” “a stricken city,” ‘a shrunken limb,” etc.

FILLING IN. 
Sometimes a composition lacks force and clearness because 
of gaps left in the telling. The gaps may be in the “setting” 
of a story, as noticed previously (Lessons 218, 219); or, in 
going on from sentence to sentence, the writer has neglected 
to put in necessary details. Consequently, questions in the 
mind of the reader have no answer in the story. Here is 
an example: 
The Cherokee Indians were going to attack Fort Lee. [Where was 
it? At what time was the incident?] The people [who were they?] had 
grown careless because the Indians had been delayed [by what? how?}. 
Some of the people went outside the fort [for what purpose—work, 
pleasure, nutting?], and Catherine Sherrill was among them [who was 
she?]. She went farther into the woods than the rest [doing what?]. They 
did not know danger was at hand until the war-whoop sounded, etc. 
The omissions need not be supplied in such detail as to 
make the story too long or too full of side-excursions; but . 
sufficient detail should be put in to make the story intelligible 
to the reader and to draw him on by compelling his attention. 
Exercise.—In the two paragraphs below, supply any 
essential details that have been omitted: 
(a) Once not long ago there came a thunderstorm. Before the storm 
the clouds were very dark. The wind was blowing very hard, and every-

arriving there almost penniless. He walked the streets day after day, 
hunting for work to do. He afterwards got a position in a printer’s 
shop, which he bought later. Though he was young, his writings gained 
considerable notice. His most famous writing was ‘‘Poor Richard’s 
Almanac.” He invented the lightning-rod.

LESSON 296. 
PARTICIPLE AND GERUND, 
As shown in Lesson 241, there is in addition to verbs a 
large and extremely useful class of words known as verbals. 
They not only express action or being, as verbs do, but they 
may have direct objects, complements, and modifiers as verbs. 
do; but the great point of difference is, that verbals are not 
used as predicates to say something about a subject. 
The classes of verbals aré participles, gerunds, and infini- 
tives. Participles and gerunds are much alike in form; that) 
is, all the words used as gerunds may also be used as parti- 
ciples. 
The following list shows all the participles of the verb ring, 
the forms in italics being used as both participles and gerunds: 
Active, Voice. 
Imperfect, ringing. Perfect, having rung. 
Perfect Progressive, having been ringing.
-P-A-G-E-277
250 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Passive Voice. 
Perfect, rung, being rung, or having been rung. 
(The form being rung is sometimes imperfect also in use.) 
The difference in use may be shown in these sentences: 
1. Having recorded my hero's fights of all sorts, I shall now proceed. 
to give an account of his passage-at-arms with Williams. 
2. Suddenly at this point Arthur bursts out crying. 
3. Here is the Slogger, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray. 
4. He was not a bit the worse except a slight difficulty in his vision, 
and a strained thumb. 
5. The ring melts away in a few seconds, the small boys tearing off, 
Tom collaring his jacket and waistcoat, and slipping through 
the little gate by the chapel. 
6. What would life be without fighting? 
. From the cradle to the grave, fighting is the business of every man. 
8. East can’t help shouting challenges to two or three of the other 
side. 
In sentence 1, having recorded belongs to the subject I, 
though it does not directly modify it, as the word strained 
modifies thumb in sentence 4. The verbal=verb nature + 
adjective nature in both. 
In sentence 2, crying may be taken as a complement of the 
verb and a modifier of the subject Arthur. 
In 3, stripped and thirsting are loose modifiers of Slogger. 
In 5, the words in ing are used ‘as principal words in abso- 
lute phrases, accompanying the nouns boys and Tom. Each 
one of these verbals= verb use + adjective use; hence are 
participles. 
A participle is a verbal ending usually in ing, ed, t or m, and 
used as an adjunct of some noun or word used as a noun. 
In sentences 6, 7, and 8, the words fighting and shouting 
are used as verb++noun. In 7, fighting is the object of the 
preposition without; in 8, fighting is the subject of ts; in 8, 
shouting is the object of can’t help, but at the same time it
-P-A-G-E-278
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 251 
carries its own object challenges and is modified by a phrase: 
they are gerunds. 
A gerund is a verbal having the form of a participle but 
the use of a noun. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, select the participles 
and gerunds by giving the use of each, then tell which form 
it is—active or passive, present or perfect, etc.:

252 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
Active Voice. 
Present, to ring. Present progressive, to be ringing. 
Perfect, to have rung. Perfect progressive, to have been 
ringing. 
Passive Voice. 
Present, to be rung. Perfect, to have been rung. 
The word to is not always expressed’ with the present 
infinitive, especially after such verbs as make, let, see, dare, 
need, etc. When used, to may be considered a part of the 
infinitive. 
The uses of the infinitive may be seen in the following 
sentences: 
1. (a) It would have been one man’s work #o see that the precocious 
youngsters had fair play.—To rusk and seize upon this desk was 
the great object of ambition. 
(b) Never try fo be popular, but only to do your duty. 
(c) Brooke places four or five picked players before the goal, 
whose duty is io keep the ball away to the sides. 
(d) Flashman excited his associates fo join him in bringing the 
young vagabonds to their senses. 
(e) East forgets everything except their old resolve, never to be 
. beaten by that bully Flashman. 
“'2, Then came summonses to open, which being unanswered, the 
assault commenced.—He didn’t see Diggs, and thought it a good 
chance to keep his hand in, 
*3. Argus himself would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them.— 
All the boys stopped their work to look on. 
4. Other fifth-form boys began to look at them.—A peck of troubles 
you'll get into if you’re going to play that game. 
5. Sad to say, both of our youngsters had. got into the habit of 
doing things which were forbidden. 
‘In.group 1, all the infinitives are used as nouns—(a) as 
subject, (b) direct. object, (c) subjective complement, (d) 
objective complement, (e) apposition.
-P-A-G-E-280
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 253 
In 2, the infinitives modify nouns; hence they have an 
adjective use. 
In 3, to keep and to look modify verbs; hence they have an 
adverb use. 
In group 4 is seen a use somewhat different from the sub- 
jective complement: the infinitive completes the predicate, 
but it belongs to the verb only. It is called the complemen=- 
tary infinitive. 
In 5, the infinitive is used as an independent element. 
An infinitive is a verbal which has the simple, or root 
form of a verb, and is used as a noun or as a modifier. 
Exercise.—In the following sentences, tell the use of each 
infinitive; also tell which form it is—active or passive, 
present or perfect, progressive, etc.: 
1. “Don’t you remember what old Brooke said about learning to 
take our own parts?” 
2, The boys had, or thought they had, a right to fish over the whole 
of this part of the river. 
3. The object of schools is not to cram Latin and Greek into bays, 
but to make them good future citizens. 
4. To leave it, therefore, in the hands of inferior men, is just giving 
up the highest part of the work. 
5. The Doctor was sure to make an example of the School-house

EXPOSITION. 
Exposition is that form of discourse which seeks to explain 
something. 
The word exposition means the act of laying out to view, 
unfolding, explaining. It may be the explanation of a process 
—telling how a thing is done; it may be one’s views upon a 
subject, for example, editorial articles in the newspapers; 
or it may be an explanation of one topic or another in a text- 
book. : 
When a term or a proposition is before the writer’s mind 
for exposition, there are three ways in which he is likely to 
place his thoughts upon it before the reader: 
1. By using COMPARISON OR CONTRAST—using something 
familiar to make clear what is now new or obscure; for 
example: 
(Contrast) Man is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature 
leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but | 
the embellishment of his early life, or a song piped in the intervals of
-P-A-G-E-284
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 257 
the acts. He seeks for fame, for fortune, for space in the world’s thought, 
and dominion over his fellow-men.. But a woman’s whole life is the 
history of the affections. The heart is her world: it is there her ambition 
strives for empire; it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures. She 
sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul 
in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless—for 
it is a bankruptcy of the heart.—Irving. 
(Comparison) She is like some tender tree, the pride and beauty of 
the grove; graceful in its form, bright in its foliage, but with the worm 
preying at its heart. We find it suddenly withering, when it should be 
most fresh and luxuriant. We see it drooping its branches to the earth, 
and shedding leaf by leaf, until, wasted and perished away, it falls even 
in the stillness of the forest; and as we muse over the beautiful ruin, we 
strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunder-bolt that could have 
smitten it with decay.—Irving. 
2. By giving PARTICULARS OR DETAILS after some general 
Statement; for example: 
But Europe held forth the charms of storied and poetical association. 
There were to be seen the masterpieces of art, the refinements of highly 
cultivated society, the quaint peculiarities of ancient and local custom. 
My native country was full of youthful promise: Europe was rich in the 
accumulated treasures of age. Her very ruins told the history of times 
gone by, and every mouldering stone was a chronicle. I longed to 
wander over the scenies of renowned achievement—to tread, as it were, 
in the footsteps of antiquity—to loiter about the ruined castle—to 
meditate on the falling tower—to escape, in short, from the common- 
place realities of the present, and lose myself among the shadowy gran- 
deurs of the past.—Irving. 
3. By giving ILLUSTRATIONS OR EXAMPLES after some 
abstract statement; for example: 
Though we seem grieved at the shortness of life in general, we are 
wishing every period of it at an end. The minor longs to be at age, 
then to be a man of business, then to make up an estate, then to arrive 
at honors, then to retire. Thus, although the whole of life is allowed by 
every one to be short, the several divisions of it appear long and tedious. 
We are for lengthening our span in general, but would fain contract 
the parts of which it is composed. The usurer would be very well 
satisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies between the present

moment and next quarter-day. The politician would be contented to 
lose three years in his life, could he place things in the posture which 
he fancies they will stand in after such a revolution in time. The lover

Exercise 1.—Find in good literature an example of one of 
these modes of exposition illustrated above.

on one of the following subjects, then write as many. para- 
graphs of exposition giving your views:

LESSON 306. 
ADVERBS—SIMPLE. 
One class of adverbs may be studied in the following 
sentences: 
1. The clerk involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sen- 
sible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the 
last frail spark forever. 
2. I cannot rest, I cannot linger anywhere. 
3. This was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power. 
4. It was a very small fire, almost none on such a day. 
Since all of these modify and do nothing more, they are 
called simple adverbs. 
In sentence 1, involuntarily modifies applauded, and 
answers the question, How? Hence it is a simple adverb of 
manner.. Also, immediately modifies becoming, and forever 
modifies extinguished; and both express time. 
In sentence 2, anywhere expresses place.
-P-A-G-E-286
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 259 
In sentence 3, the adverb perhaps does not modify any one 
word, but the whole statement: it is called an adverb of 
assertion. 
In sentence 4, very and almost modify adjectives, and tell 
to what extent, or degree. Adverbs of degree usually modify 
adjectives or adverbs. . 
Adverbs of manner are very numerous, including many 
words in ly, besides a few others; as, lightly, carefully, harshly, 
cheerfully, etc. 
Adverbs of time are, now, then, soon, before, since, lately, etc. 
Adverbs of place are, here, there, anywhere, nowhere, every- 
where, yonder, up, down, over, hither, thither, hence, thence, etc. 
Adverbs of assertion are, so, thus, then, hence, accordingly, etc. 
Adverbs of degree are, so, too, enough, very, almost, etc. 
A simple adverb is one that modifies only. 
Many of these words do not belong to one class only, but 
may be used in several ways: thus may be an adverb of 
manner or of assertion; far may express place or degree; so 
may express manner, degree, or assertion, etc. 
Adverbs are compared in the same way as adjectives, viz.: 
some by adding er and est for the comparative and superlative, 
some by using more and most. 
The adverb well answers to the adjective good (compara- 
tive better, superlative best); the adverb badly (or ill) answers 
to the adjective bad (comparative worse, superlative worst). 
The words late, far, near, and little, when used as adverbs, 
are compared in exactly the same way as when adjectives 
(Lesson 147). 
Exercise.—Classify the adverbs in the following sentences, 
and tell what each modifies: 
1. The arms were very long and muscular. 
2. The city had entirely vanished. 
3. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully real to look 
at, stood outside the window.

LESSON 307. 
ADVERBS~—INTERROGATIVE AND CONJUNCTIVE. 
In the sentences below may be found two other classes of 
adverbs: 
1. “Why did you get married?” said Scrooge —The spirit, passing 
on above the moor, sped—whither ? 
2. (a) Scrooge stopped—not so much in obedience as in surprise 
and fear. 
(b) The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. 
(c) He found himself as close to the unearthly visitor as I am to 
you. 
3. Let any man explain to me how it was that Scrooge saw in the 
knocker—not a knocker, but Marley’s face. 
In 1, why and whither modify verbs and also ask questions: 
they are called interrogative adverbs. 
In each sentence-of 2, there are pairs of connectives, the 
first being an adverb, the second a conjunction. In (a), so 
modifies the adverb much and helps to join the two clauses; 
in (6), the first the modifies more, an adverb, and helps to 
connect; in (c), the first as modifies the adjective close, and 
helps to connect: hence the first word of each pair is a con= 
junctive adverb. 
Those so used are so—as, so—that, as—as, the first being 
an adverb, the second a conjunction. The—the and as—so, 
when connecting in pairs, are all adverbs.
-P-A-G-E-288
PRACTICAL ENGLISH 261 
In 3, how introduces an indirect question; it expresses 
manner, modifying was; and it connects the independent 
clause “Let any man explain to me” with the dependent 
clause “it was”: hence how also is a conjunctive adverb. 
Any of the interrogative adverbs may be thus used. 
An interrogative adverb is one that asks a direct question. 
A conjunctive adverb is one that connects, or helps to 
connect, a dependent with an independent clause. 
Exercise.—Classify all the adverbs in the following sen- 
tences, telling the exact use of each in its sentence: 
1. The gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down out of a Gothic 
window. 
2. “How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, 
I may not tell.” 
3. “I am here to-night to warn you that you have yet a chance of

LESSON 312. 
ADVERBS AND PREDICATE ADJECTIVES. 
For several reasons, adverbs and predicate adjectives are 
sometimes confused by young writers: jirst, becatise some 
adverbs are much like adjectives in form—as, “a sound 
sleep, 66 ‘sound asleep”; second, because the writer is not 
certain what the real function of the word is, and uses one 
incorrectly for another; third, possibly because the writer is 
merely thoughtless.
-P-A-G-E-293
264 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
A useful guide in the use of such words is the following 
distinction: 
1. If the purpose is to assert some quality of the subject 
or object, a predicate adjective should be used. Lists of verbs 
have already been studied (Lessons 37, 42, Part I), which 
are followed by subjective and objective complements. 
These should be reviewed. 
EXxaMPLes.— The sky grew dark”; ‘The rose smelled sweet”; ‘‘The 
cook boiled the egg hard’; ‘I planed the board smooth.” 
2. If the purpose is to express the manner of the action, 
an adverb should be used. 
Exampies.— The wind blew shrilly”; “The bird sang sweetly in the 
tree’; ‘‘Some performers play magnificently on the violin.” 
- Exercise 1.-Explain the difference between the pairs of 
sentences below: 
1. (a) The wind blew swiftly.—(b) The wind blew cold. 
2. (a) The master looked sternly at the boy.—(b) The master looked 
stern. 
3- (a) The cloth felt smooth—(b) She felt the cloth carefully. 
Exercise 2.—Choose by analysis of the sentence the proper 
form to be used in each of the following sentences, stating 
your reason before giving your conclusion: 
. He drew himself (quick, quickly) into the window. 
. The huge shark was looking up (hungry, hungrily) at them. 
. He was (certain, certainly) that his hand had been bitten off. 
. The sailor was in doubt whether he should appear pleased or 
(angry, angrily). 
5. Old Tom smiled (grim, grimly) at the allusion to the shark; for 
he had been sitting (quiet, quietly) in the boat picking rope, 
and had witnessed the whole adventure.

LESSON 316. 
CONJ UNCTIONS—COORDINATE. 
Some conjunctions always connect words, phrases, and 
clauses or members of equal rank. Now and then they even 
introduce a sentence, and connect it with a sentence going 
before. 
Examples of conjunctions of this class: 
1. (Words) The fame of his abilities and learning continued to grow. 
2. (Phrases) Pitt was not a man to be disheartened by a single 
failure, or to be put down by the most lively repartee. 
3. (Clauses) In the son, as in the father, there might perhaps be too 
much pride; but there was nothing low or sordid. 
4. (Sentences) To predominate over such a society was not easy. 
Yet even over such a society Johnson predominated. 
Words thus used are called coordinate conjunctions. 
A coordinate conjunction is one that connects words, 
phrases, or clauses of equal rank, and sometimes sentences. 
The most important of these are as follows: and, connect- 
ing expressions in the same line of thought; but, yet, still, 
however, connecting expressions in opposition or contrast; 
or, nor, connecting expressions between which there is a 
choice; and for, therefore, connecting a clause of conclusion 
to a preceding clause. 
Exercise.—Select the coérdinate conjunctions in the sen- 
tences below, and tell by analysis what each connects: 
1. This species of composition had been brought into fashion by 
the success of the Tatler, and by the still more brilliant success 
of the Spectator. 
2. None of them had obtained a permanent place in our literature; 
and they are now to be found only in the libraries of the 
curious.

4. It was soon known that these articles were written by Chester- 
field. But the just resentment of Johnson was not to be so 
appeased. 
5. Johnson never willingly read or thought or talked about affairs

6. This stock of learning was all that he ever possessed; for he very 
early became too busy to have any spare time for books. 
7. The King, reluctantly and ungraciously, accepted Rockingham

8. His father had never been so powerful, nor Walpole, nor Marl-

9. What the particular criticisms were Fox had forgotten; but he 
said he was much struck by the precocity of the lad. 
io. Langton was distinguished by his skill in Greek literature, by 
the orthodoxy of his opinions, and by the sanctity of his life. 
LESSON 317. 
CONJUNCTIONS——-SUBORDINATE. 
Many dependent clauses are connected with some word 
in the independent clause by subordinate conjunctions. 
A subordinate conjunction is one that introduces a depend- 
ent clause and joins it to some word in the clause modified. 
For example, in the sentence, “When he drew his hand- 
kerchief from the water, the fish leaped after it,”’ the depend- 
ent clause, “‘when he drew his handkerchief from the water” 
modifies the verb leaped; so. the subordinate conjunction 
when connects its clause with the verb leaped, of the inde- 
pendent clause. 
The list of subordinate conjunctions coincides very nearly 
with the list of adverbial clauses in Lesson 196:

LESSON 322. 
WORDS HAVING SEVERAL USES. 
In the list in Lesson 317 it was found that the word as may 
be a subordinate conjunction of time, manner, reason, degree 
or comparison, and result; in Lesson 307 it was found that 
as is used also as a conjunctive adverb. 
Again, it was found in Lesson 317 that the word that may 
be used as a subordinate conjunction of purpose, of result, 
and to introduce a substantive clause (or noun clause); and 
‘that since may be a subordinate conjunction of time and of 
reason. : 
In determining, therefore, to what sub-class of subordinate 
conjunctions a word belongs, not merely the conjunction 
but the whole dependent clause must be studied; and the 
meaning of the clause must be ascertained before a sure 
answer is given. 
Exercise.—Tell to what sub-class of subordinate conjunc- 
tions that, stnce, or as belongs in each instance in the following 
sentences, and also tell what each connects: 
1, Indians sometimes use a dog trained for the purpose, as we expect

LESSON 326. 
CORRELATIVES. 
Two or more words accompanying each other and helping 
to connect parts of sentences, are called correlatives. 
These are of several classes: 
1. An adverb in the dependent clause and one in the inde- 
pendent clause: such are as—so, and the-—the (Lesson 307). 
2. An adverb in the independent clause and a subordinate . 
conjunction in the dependent clause: such are so—as, so— 
that, as—as (Lesson 307). 
3. A subordinate conjunction in the dependent clause and 
a coordinate conjunction in the independent clause: such 
are if—then, although—vyet. 
4. Codrdinate conjunctions in sets of two or three: such 
are both—and, not only—but (also), either—or (—or), whether 
—or, neither—nor (—nor). 
Exercise.—Point out the correlatives in the sentences 
below, and tell what parts of sentencés are joined by each 
set:

10. If you could conquer one panther with a single load of duck-shot

LESSON 327. 
SYNTAX OF CONJUNCTIONS. 
Some requirements in regard to the use of conjunctions 
should be studiously attended to, as some care will prevent 
many efrors in composition; these are: 
1. The codrdinate correlatives should be placed so that 
the things connected shall have the same relative position; 
as, 
His mind gathers not only heat, but clearness and expansion, by 
its own motion. 
Since one of the correlatives, not only, precedes a noun, 
the other, but, should also precede nouns, as it does here. 
A careless writer might have said, “His mind not only gathers 
heat, but clearness,” etc. 
2. When two comparisons are made in a sentence by the use 
of adverbs and conjunctions, all the words necessary should 
be expressed, or the words so arranged as to avoid confusion; 
as, 
The weather was as bitter, if not more so, than last winter. 
In this sentence, as would seem to express equality, and 
another as would be expected after it; but more so expresses 
inequality, and than would naturally follow. A better way 
of writing this would be— 
18 
atin
-P-A-G-E-305
74 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
The weather is as bitter as, if not more bitter than, that of last 
winter, 
Or 
The weather is as bitter as that of last winter, if not more bitter. 
The latter is more smooth and natural. 
3. The word ike should not be used as a conjunction in 
place of as or as if; for example, do not say, ‘‘ The little boy 
runs like he is badly scared,”’ or ‘Tom walks just like his 
father does.’’ 
Use as if in the first of these sentences, and as in the second. 
Like may be used when no verb is expressed, as, ‘““The 
little boy runs Ike a scared rabbit,” or “Tom walks just like 
his father’; but Ike should not be followed by a verb in a 
complete clause. 
4. When and where are often incorrectly used to introduce 
a noun clause used as subjective complement; for example, 
“Precocity is when a child shows early talent,” or ‘Surrender 
is where a general gives up his army to the enemy.” 
Instead, a noun should be used as the complement, and 
the conjunction thrown out; thus,‘'Precocity is the develop- 
ment of early talent in a child,” or “Surrender is the giving 
up of an army by the conquered general.” 
_ Exercise {.—Place the correlatives in the proper place 
instead of the carets in the following sentences, giving reason 
for your choice of position: 
1. (Not only—but) He was/by far the greatest man of his age, A 
abounding Ain knowledge himself, /\feeding, in various directions, his 
most able contemporaries. 
2. (Neither—nor) IAborrowAfrom the LatinAfrom any other

3. (Both—and) IAtradeAwithAthe living \the dead. 
4. (Not only—but also) In some of the most trustworthy stories of

LESSONS 329, 330. 
EXPANDING. 
Sometimes interest is excited by such a remark as, “I went 
to the circus yesterday,” or ‘I saw a horse run away with a 
milk wagon this morning.” We immediately wish to hear 
the particulars. yy
-P-A-G-E-307
276 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
And when we ask for particulars, we expect to hear the 
details, step by step, that work out the general statement 
which aroused our interest, and no others. We do not enjoy 
the recital if the speaker or writer, after his general statement, 
wanders aside to talk about something else. 
The work of expanding, or amplifying, consists in begin- 
ning with a general statement and working out of it the implied 
description, narration, or exposition in all its details. 
The plan for expanding should be as follows: 
1. Study the short quotation given, until the picture, 
story, or line of reasoning has been clearly comprehended; 
for example: 
There lies, on the other side of the sea, a beautiful island where I 
love to dwell. : 
From the nature of the quotation, description should be 
used as the means of development; hence the picture should 
be imagined until it seems real and familiar. 
2. Construct an outline. In this instance, it might be 
as follows: 
I. Description of the island— 
(a) Itssize. (b) Scenery. (c) Plant life. (d) Birds. 
II. How we enjoy life there— 
(a) Occupations. (6) Pleasures. 
3. After this has been written out in the proper number 
of paragraphs, it should be revised and rewritten. 
Exercise 1.—As above directed, expand: one of the follow- 
ing general statements into a description:   
(a) In the course of a summer journey, I rode for a long distance 
in one of the old stage coaches.

LESSON 331. 
PREPOSITIONS. 
The use of prepositions may be shown in these sentences: 
1. They had books and papers im their hands. 
2, Martha came out from behind the closet door. 
3. There ‘was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the 
door, except that it was very large. 
In sentence 1, 77 has as object the word hands, a noun. 
Besides a noun object, the preposition may govern a pronoun, 
a gerund, an infinitive, and sometimes an adverb. 
In sentence 2, from has as object the phrase behind the 
door. 
In sentence 3, the object of except is the clause that ii it was 
very large. 
Hence a preposition may have as object a word, a phrase, 
or a clause.
-P-A-G-E-309
278 PRACTICAL ENGLISH 
. This ‘use of the preposition, to introduce a phrase modifier, 
is its only use, except when it is attached to a verb or verbal 
as part of it; for example, ‘‘He regarded this as a matter 
that must be attended to promptly.” 
Prepositions are not usually divided into classes: they 
express time, place (place where, whither, or whence), source, 
etc., and the relation must be judged from the sentence in 
general, not from the preposition itself. 
For example, af may express place or time; of may express 
source, material, separation, agency, etc. 
A preposition is a word that introduces a phrase modifier 
and shows the relation between its object and the word 
modified. 
Exercise.-From your reading of some pages of good lit- 
erature, make and bring to class a list of twenty prepositions. 
LESSON 382. 
WORDS HAVING SEVERAL USES. 
Some words have now been found used as several parts of 
speech: for example, but is an adverb, a conjunction, and a 
preposition; before, after, since, may be adverbs, conjunctions 
or prepositions; until may be a conjunction or a preposition; 
‘up, down, in, around, over, under, by, off, about, on, and others 
may be adverbs or prepositions. Hence the use in the sen- 
tence must be closely observed. 
Exercise.—Give the use of each italicized word in the 
sentences below, and tell what part of speech it is: 
1: Since you ask me what I wish, that is my answer. 
2. Since the change of Indian agents, many of his people were 
hostile to the whites. 
3. He had sprained his ankle, and ever since had been slowly and

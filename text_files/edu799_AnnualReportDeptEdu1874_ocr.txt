STATE SUPERINTENDENT’s REPORT. 
To His Excellency, John C. Brown, 
Governor of Tennessee : 
The Public School Law requires the State Superintendent “to 
annually submit to the Governor, on or before the the 15th day of 
December, a detailed report of his official proceedings for the year 
preceding, exhibiting a plain, statistical account of receipts and ex- 
penditures for Public Schools, and of their condition and progress, 
showing the number of children, male and female, white and col-' 
ored, respectively, in the State and in each county, between the ages 
of six and eighteen years, the total number of pupils enrolled, the 
average number belonging and the per cent. of attendance during 
the year, the average paid to teachers, male and female, the amount . 
of each branch of school expenditures severally, the cost of educa- 
tion per scholar, and whatever else may tend to show the degree of 
success and usefulness of the system.” 
Before entering upon the detail of official proceedings, as 
thus required, it may serve a good purpose to glance briefly 
at the educational condition of the State before the time 
of the passage of our present school law. Prior to the 
civil war, the interest upon the school fund—amounting annually 
to $90,000—-had for many years, been rateably distributed 
among the several counties of the State, for the maintenance of “free - 
schools.” The sums thus realized by the school districts, sever- 
ally, were so inconsiderable, and the provisions made for the profita- 
ble use of the money so imperfect, that but little good was, or could 
be, accomplished. The “schools” thus maintained for a few weeks 
in the year—and taught usually by incompetent persons—were not 
‘looked to by the people as sources of instruction for their children, 
but rather as temporary eleemosynary establishments, at which 
the children of “poor people” might enjoy a scanty charity in the
-P-A-G-E-6
[6] 
shape of bad primary instruction. The public school operations of 
those years need only be referred to as illustrating the necessity of a 
well-founded and thoroughly organized State system, as a means of 
popular education, though at the same time, nevertheless, foreshadow- 
ing a more generous effort, as now witnessed, in the right direction. 
The school law of 1867, was the first legislative experiment toward 
the establishment of a thoroughly appointed State system of pub- 
——lic instruction in Tennessee. The result of that experiment is well 
known. For many reasons, that need not be particularized, it did 
not succeed. It is enough to say the experiment was inopportunely 
made, and the projected system was ill-adapted to the prevailing 
condition of our people. The echoes of the war had not died 
away. Political and social disorder still prevailed throughout the 
State, anda people, not yet assured of their civil status, were not in 
a favorable condition to be very profitably concerned about a costly 
system of popular education, or to be cheerfully taxed for its sup- 
port. Thus, lacking popular favor and confidence, the experiment: 
failed, and may be now advantageously cited, in contrast with the 
ante bellum “system,” as demonstrating that in public school enter- 
prises, as in other matters, as much -harm may often result from at- 
tempting too much, as from being content with too little ; and, fur- 
ther, that an active popular sympathy is essential to the success of 
any system of public instruction. 
The school law of 1867 was supplanted by that of 1870, which 
virtually remitted the whole subject of popular education to the 
several counties, without imposing any obligations upon them to 
take action in the premises. All State leyies upon property for 
school purposes were repealed, and a tax retained upon polls of only 
fifty cents. The law of 1870 was not inspired by hostility to 
public schools, but was manifestly believed to be the best that 
the temper of the public mind and the disordered financial condi- 
tion of the State would then warrant. Though accepted by many 
of the friends of education in that spirit, and though embracing 
many excellent features, the law practically failed because of its. 
inherent weakness as a whole. Wanting a general head, it lacked 
unity and vitality. Though well designed for local application, where 
it might chance to be earnestly put in force, there was no sanction 
of State authority for the enforcement of the law. True, a subse- 
quent act provided that the State Treasurer should be Superintend-
-P-A-G-E-7
‘ [7] 
ent of Public Instruction, ex officio; yet, he was a Superintendent 
without a charge and without authority. No special duties were 
imposed upon him, for even the office of State Superintendent was 
ignored by the school “law itself—no one of its provisions having 
any relation to any such functionary. Nevertheless, the Treasurer, 
moved by an interest in the public welfare, and aided through 
the liberality of the Peabody Board of Trustees, engaged an 
assistant, who, during the year 1872, spent much time in 
‘an endeavor to excite public interest in the cause of Public 
Schools. The result of that year’s school operations is present- 
ed in the report of Colonel Killbrew, by Treasurer Morrow, 
to the last General Assembly. From said report we learn 
that, of the ninety-three counties in the State, only twenty- 
nine levied any tax whatever, for school purposes, and 
ip some of these the tax was only nominal; and it is estimated b: 
the Assistant, from all the returns furnished him, that, during the 
year 1872, not one-fifth of the scholastic population of the State 
had any means of education. “Indeed,” says the report, “in 
some of the counties visited, there was not a single school—neither 
public nor private—in operation ; nor were there any efforts being 
made by the citizens to remedy the deficiency.” And we are told 
finally, as a summation of the whale matter, that “the system 
of public instruction now (then) in operation is a farce, and utterly 
devoid of vitality.” 
The following are mentioned, in said report, as vital objections to 
to the system of 1870: 
First—It secures no unity of action. 
Second—It fails to secure a lively interest in school matters. 
Third—It is totally destitute of energy and is liable to be termi- 
nated in any county at the pleasure 0 the magistrates. 
Fourth—Its provisions to secure statistics are inefficient'‘and un- 
reliable. 
These objections are well stated, while others might have been 
added ; and my own experience warrants me in saying that like ob- 
jections may always be truthfully presented as against any public 
school system that is not set in motion, and kept in motion, by a 
central State authority. 
The advantages of our present system over any other that has 
been tried in Tennessee, may be made to appear, by a glance at th
-P-A-G-E-8
[8] . 
tabular statements of its results, from which the public mind will 
be enabled to draw its own logical conclusions. I will take occasion 
to remark, however, that even the system, as now organized in Ten- 
nessee, has not been subjected to such experiment as fairly and fully 
tests its merits. It might be enough to say that the officers of the sys- 
tem, from the highest to the lowest, were generally inexperienced, 
and, of course, lacked familiarity with the detailed requirements of the 
law. The times have not been propitious for the projection of any 
enterprises that depended upon public taxation for support. Our 
_ agricultural products have been shortened by droughts, and our 
commercial operations of all descriptions have been embarrassed by 
unusual financial distress. Added to all this, it may be said that 
the agitation of the so-called supplemental Civil Rights Bill was 
hurtful to a degree that cannot well be estimated. This agitation 
continued during a whole year, and even yet the mere possibility of 
the passage of such a measure exerts a marked hurtful influence. 
Nevertheless, in spite of these inauspicious and damaging influences, 
the statistics of school operations, as:shown in the appended state- 
ments, are sufficient to demonstrate that our present law is wisely 
constructed, and needs only some prudent modifications to make it 
satisfactory to the friends of popular education, and to render it suc- 
cessful in its general practical application. 
Notwithstanding the tabular details to be’found in the Appendix 
to this report, it may facilitate a clear understanding of it, to give 
here a comprehensive epitome of results, which I proceed to do as 
follows: 
Scholastic population for 1873: white male, 161,559; white fe- 
male, 152,023; total white, 318,582; colored male, 53,635; colored 
female, 50,968; total colored, 104,603; total, 418,185. 
Scholastic population for 1874: white male, 163,130; white fe- 
male, 153,398; total white, 316,528; colored male, 53,004; colored 
female, 50,852; total colored, 103,856; total, 420,884. Increase 
over previous year, 2,199. 
No. of pupils enrolled, [Marion(1) county not reporting] 258,577. 
Average attendance, excepting Cheatham, Cocke, Coffee, Decatur, 
Lake, Marion and Scott (7) counties, 161,089. No. schools organ- 
ized, excepting Marion (1) county—white, 4,227; colored, 923; 
total, 5,150. No. teachers employed, excepting Marion (1) county 
—white male, 3,600; white female, 1,030; colored male, 627; col-
-P-A-G-E-9
[9] 
ored female, 294; total, 5,551. Average number months taught dur- 
ing the year, for the State, 3.854. Average per month paid teach- 
ers, for the State, $33.03. No. of teachers licensed, except in 
Marion (1) county—white male, 4,157; white female, 1,122; col- 
ored male, 674; colored female, 311; total, 6,264. No. applicants 
examined, excepting in Marion (1) county, 6,689. ’ 
Amounts of State school moneys apportioned: Semi-annual in- 
terest on permanent school fund, October, 1873, $75,374.52. Semi- 
annual interest, April, 1874, $75,874.51. State poll tax April, 
1874, $47,739.17 ; Semi-annual interest October, 1874, $75,375.00. 
State poll tax, October, 1874, $18,312.55. Total from October, 
1873, to October, 1874, inclusive, $292,177.20, : 
Receipts of moneys for school purposes for scholastic year ending 
August 31,1874: From the State, $265,951.53; from counties, 
522,453.172. Total, $788,404.702. ‘ 
Nore.—Many of the County Superintendents reported the amounts collected from 
~property as derived from the counties, because paid into the county treasury; others 
reported such amounts as derived from the State, because raised under State levy. 
Strictly stated, the account would stand thus: Derived from interest on permanent 
fund and poll tax, $198,489.17 ; from tax on property, $589,915.53}. In the fore- 
going statement of total apportionments ($292,177.20), the apportionment of October, 
1874, which does not belong to thescholastic year, covered by this report, is included. 
’ This will explain the apparent difference in the amount apportioned and received. 
Besides some of the counties had not received the moneys due them when the 
County Superintendents’ reports were made out. . 
Amount received from district and city taxation, $112,636.17 ; 
from other sources, $97,418.23. Total received for the entire State, 
(including cities) $998,459.10. 
Expenditures of school moneys: Paid teachers, $769,459.75; 
building, repairing and furnishing school-houses, $101,875.98. 
Salaries of County Superintendents, $37,023.64. Other ex- 
penses, $69,017.09. Total, (including cities) $977,376.46. Total, 
(exclusive of cities) $777,492.97. Expenses of State Superintend- 
ent’s office, (including salary) $3,792.60. Total, (excluding cities) 
$781,285.573. 
Cost of pupil enrolled per month (exclusive of cities) 81 4-5 
cents. 
Per cent. of enrollment upon scholastic population, 61 per cent. 
Per. cent. of average attendance upon enrollment, 62 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-10
[10] & 
Per cent. of average attendance upon scholastic population, (ex- 
clusive of eight counties not reporting average attendance) 38 per 
cent. 
Norse.—The law requires a report of the “average number belonging.” This 
in our present condition, is simply an impossibility, and should be stricken from the 
law. : 
Average salary, per county, paid to County Superintendent, 
$420.81. 
It is worthy of note, in this connection, that the aggregate of the 
salaries of State and County Superintendents, together with the ex~ 
penses of State Superintendent’s office, has been just 43 per cent. of 
the total school revenues collected, exclusive of the city funds.

The law, in terms, requires the State Superintendent to make “a 
detailed report of his official proceedings for the year.” I presume 
only “proceedings” of a general character were intended, since a 
“detailed report” of all my official acts during the year would con- 
stitute a volume far exceeding the dimensions of the contemplated 
“Annual Report.” For such of my “ official proceedings,” as it is 
deemed necessary to report, I respectfully refer to the documents 
embraced in the Appendix, except as herein reported. 
LICENSING TEACHERS. 
One of the chief difficulties, encountered at the outset, was in the 
procurement of competent teachers for the public schools. In many 
of the counties, as has already been shown, but few schools had 
been maintained for several years, and a large proportion of the 
schools of the State had been conducted by incompetent teachers. 
‘Without competent teachers, schools are worthless, if not worse, 
and to secure teachers of proper qualification, seemed at the time an 
impossibility. Certainly, it was not practicable to establish, at once, 
as high a standard of qualification, in the inception of our under- 
taking, as we may hope to attain after a few years of experience 
and progress. To meet the emergency presented, in June, 1873, I
-P-A-G-E-14
[14] 
issued the “Instructions touching the mode of examining and li- 
censing school teachers, and their qualifications,” to be found in the 
Appendix. Those instructions have operated satisfactorily, thus far, 
and have not yet been changed. However, we have reached a point 
when the standard of qualification should be advanced, and it is in 
contemplation to modify the Instructions to County Superintendents 
accordingly. That many incompetent teachers have been employed 
in the public schools is lamentably true; yet, it is hoped that, with 
increased rigor in the examinations, all cause of complaint, on this 
account, may be gradually removed. 
In this connection, it may be proper to remark, that the average 
paid teachers, as set forth in the foregoing summary, ($33.03), in- 
cludes the ayeragé of the city schools, which are more costly and 
under municipal control. Owing to the manner in which reports 
were made, it has been impossible to ascertain accurately the aver- 
age in the State schools proper, though it may be approximately 
‘stated at thirty-two dollars per month. 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
In accordance with section 45 of the school law, on the 23d of 
July, 1873, I issued instructions to County Superintendents, to- 
gether with forms of petition and decree, for the incorporation of 
the school districts of their several counties. (See Appendix.) 
Said instructions have generally been complied with, and, with but 
few exceptions, the school districts in the several counties have been 
declared incorporated towns for the purposes intended, by the va~ 
rious Chancery Courts having jurisdiction. As will be seen, how- 
ever, by reference to the table, comparatively few districts have 
levied a special district tax as provided in sections 46 and 47. In 
one or two instances in which taxes have been so levied, the col- 
lection of the tax has been resisted by judicial proceeding, upon the 
alleged unconstitutionality of that part of the law conferring the 
right of taxation upon school districts, as incorporated towns. The 
question has not been decided by the Courts, and I am not prepared 
to suggest any legislation that would avoid the supposed constitu- 
tional difficulty. : 
Another serious difficulty in regard to school districts may be. 
. easily remedied by legislation. By a singular omission in the law, 
there is now no authority to change the boundaries, or increase or
-P-A-G-E-15
[15] . Oe 
diminish the number, of districts. Section 22 provides that “the 
school districts shall be as they now are, or as they may be hereafter 
established wnder the provisions of this act,” and yet the act makes 
no provision whatever for the change of school districts. The original 
bill read “as now provided by law,” but this phrase was stricken 
_ out and “under the provisions of this act” inserted—it being the 
manifest intention of the Legislature to provide a specific mode for 
changing the line of districts. But this was not done and the result 
has been much annoyance to school officers. I respectfully suggest 
that the re-enactment of the provisions of the se:ool jaw of 1870, 
on this subject, would be satisfactory. 
STATE AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
. . ¢ 
Without any known probability of being “my own successor,” 
I may be permitted to say that the offices of State and County Su- 
perintendents are absolutely necessary to the successful operation of 
the Public School System. Without them, it would be headless 
and armless~-a mere impotent organization, if, indeed, it could 
maintain the character of an organization at all. As the purpose of 
this Report is to supply facts and not to indulge in argument, I may 
be permitted to remark in regard to County Superintendents, that 
” the fact that some have been, perhaps, incompetent and neglectful 
of their duties, does not, by. any means, furnish an argument against 
the office itself. On the contrary, it will, with unvarying certainty, - 
be found that in those counties in which County Superintendents 
have been incompetent or derelict, the schools have languished and 
gone down; whereas, with like certainty, it will be found that in 
those counties in which the Superintendents have been competent 
and energetic, the schools have flourished correspondingly. The 
character of the County Superintendent may be pretty clearly 
traced in the table of school returns. Such an officer, by whatever 
name he may be called, is indispensable and should be sufficiently 
compensated to enable him to devote his time to the desired work. 
Ample compensation to a County Superintendent is good school 
economy. 
In this connection, I would call attention to the fact that the law 
makes no provision for supplying a vacancy in the office of County 
Superintendent. I have held, and so decided, that the power in the 
County Court to elect the Superintendent carries with it the right
-P-A-G-E-16
. / [16] 
to filla vacancy. This, I believe to be sound lgw, yet still there is 
no authority for filling a vacancy when a Superintendent resigns 
during Court vacation, and the result has been, in several cases, 
that counties have been, for nearly three months, without Superin- 
tendents. To remedy this, I respectfully suggest that the Judge or 
Chairman of the County Court be authorized to fill vacancies occur- 
ring in vacation. Furthermore—inasmuch as such refusals have 
occurred—in case a County Court refuses to elect a Superintendent, 
I suggest that the school Directors of the county be authorized to 
elect him. ‘ 
In this connection, also, it may be pertinent to call attention to 
the fact that while the entire official expenses of the school system 
amounts to only 4$ per cent. of the money collected, the tax col- 
wlector receives six per cent. of the fund before it reaches the school 
officers ; or rather six per cent. on the first $10,000 in each county, 
and three per cent. on each additional thousand.

The law, as [ think, very wisely left the ultimate authority over 
the subject of text books with the District Directors. The result 
has been very little complaint of the abuses that have prevailed— 
or at least been charged—under different systems in other States. 
Uniformity in text-books is certainly desirable, and in many of the 
counties, the Directors, by concert of action, have secured practical 
uniformity. By a course of prudent suggestion on the part of 
County Superintendents, the Directors of all the counties might be 
induced to take like action and thus, in a short time, we would se- 
cure county uniformity, at least. Of State uniformity in text-books, 
I have nothing to say, deeming it, for the present, wholly imprac- 
ticable. . 
PEABODY AID. 
The character and objects of the “ Peabody Education Fund ”— 
the munificent bequest of the late George Peabody—are well under- 
stood. The management and allocation of the annual proceeds of 
this Fund, is entrusted, by the Board of Trustees, to Rev. Barnas 
Sears, D.D., of Staunton, Va. Noting the advanced steps taken by 
our last Legislature, and deeply sympathizing with our people in 
their efforts to establish and build up a permanent system of free

[17] | 
elementary education, Dr. Sears, with an enlarged liberality and 
intelligent appreciation of our needs, has thus far, by every means 
at his command, (without injustice to other States), encouraged and 
aided our progress. For the year, covered by this Report, the ag- 
gregate sum of $34,300 was appropriated to the schools as named 
below, and recommended by the State Superintendent; and I may 
add that in no instance has any recommendation of aid from this 
office, within the prescribed general limits, been refused by Dr. 
Sears. The following are the schools:

The schools thus aided, have generally flourished and become ex- 
-amples of what well regulated public schools may accomplish. 
For a better understanding of the precise purposes intended to be 
effected by Peabody aid, reference is made to the letter of instruction 
-accompanying the form of application, to be found in the Appendix.
-P-A-G-E-19
[19] 
For the better instruction of teachers in the theory and practice 
of teaching, the plan of holding ten Teachers’ Institutes was pro- 
jected, through the co-operation of the State Superintendent and a 
committee of the State Teachers’ Association. There being no pro- 
vision in the school law for the support of such needed educational 
appliances, Dr. Sears, upon application, appropriated one thousand 
dollars for the purpose. These Institutes were located by the State 
Superintendent, at Limestone, Knoxville and Cleveland, for East 
Tennessee; at Shelbyville, Lebanon, Columbia and Clarksville, 
for Middle Tennessee ; and at Jackson, Trenton and Memphis, for 
West Tennessee. Those for the Eastern Division, were placed under 
the professional charge of Supt. H. Presnell, of Washington county, 
and Prof. 8. Z. Sharp, of Blount county ; for the Middle Division, — 
Supt. W. R. Garrett, of Giles county, and Prof. H. H. Smith, of 
Shelbyville ; for the Western Division, Prof. A. Pickett, Supt. of 
Memphis City Schools. The results were, in most cases, higaly 
satisfactory, but for further information on this subject, reference is 
made to the several special reports to be found in the Appendix. 
In so far asin any case there was failure of success, it was certainly 
not due to any lack of competency or fidelity on the part of the 
gentlemen selected to conduct the Institutes. In addition to the 
regular Institutes, numerous County Institutes and Teachers’ meet- 
ings were held, as shown by the reports of County Superintendents. 
These Institutes and Teachers’ meetings—which have not cost the 
State ‘and county school funds a dollar—deserve to be encouraged 
and provided for by law. : 
In consideration of the labor and ‘responsibility super-imposed 
upon this office, by reason of the supervision of the Peabody schools 
and the distribution of the Fund, Dr. Sears, also, at the request of 
the Executive Committee of the State Teachers’ Association, sup- 
plied this office with an assistant, Mr. Boyd Cornick, to whose’ in- 
telligent, prompt and laborious attention to the duties of the office 
it gives me pleasure to bear testimony. 
I take occasion, also, to bear cheerful testimony to the fact that 
for the extraneous support given to our ‘public school system, very 
much is due to Hon. Samuel Watson, member of the Peabody 
Board of Trustees, from Tennessee, whose interest in our success has 
been not merely formal,-but earnest, and whom I have ever found 
ready to do anything within his power, calculated to promote the 
advancement of our educational interests. |

STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
~ A valuable, and entirely voluntary, auxiliary to ourschool system 
has been the State Teachers’ Association, an organization of friends 
of education, designed to aid all movements looking to the more 
general education of our people. From this Association, under your 
Excellency’s recommendations, originally sprang our present school 
law. Aside from the various measures of practical importance that 
owe their projection to this body, its meetings have had the very 
perceptible effect of awakening the public mind toa thoughtful con- 
sideration of the great need of further educational advantages, and 
of encouraging school officers to a more cheerful devotion to the 
duties devolved upon them. 
Among other measures of practical importance resolved upon by 
the Teachers’ Association at its session in Nashville, December, 
1873, was the publication of a School Journal, as the organ of our 
Public School System. Messrs. Tavel, Eastman & Howell under- 
took the publication of the Journal, relying upon the receipts for 
their compensation; the Association and State. Superintendent 
agreeing to furnish the matter for the same. Fora time, the omens 
gave augury of success, and the School Journal seemed to prosper. 
But that all-mischievous blight—the agitation of the Civil Rights 
Bill—struck it, as the unlooked-for squall strikes a bark at sea, and 
from that hour it was a crippled voyager to the end of the year. 
Public confidence was at once destroyed and subscriptions ceased. 
The volume was completed, however, though at considerable loss to 
the publishers. 
A well-conducted School Journal—as a’ medium for public com- 
munication between the school officers and teachers of the State—is 
an important desideratum ; and if our system shall escape unfriendly 
legislation at Washington and Nashville, it is hoped that, with re- 
assured confidence ‘in the public mind, such a publication may be 
profitably sustained. 
STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 
The Act of the last General Assembly, relating to the State Agri- 
cultural College at Knoxville, approved March 24, 1878, pro- 
vides : 
“That two hundred and seventy-five (275) students from the 
State of Tennessee shall, at all times, be entitled to receive free tui-~ 
tion in said college, the said students to be appointed by the several
-P-A-G-E-21
[21] 
Senators and Representatives in the General A’ssembly of the State, 
each Senator being entitled to appoint two, and each Representative 
three students, according to the population of the counties represented 
by them.” , 
It has occurred to me that our State Agricultural College and 
Public School System might very profitably be brought into closer 
relations to each other. Senators and Representatives are, no doubt 
often much perplexed in making selections of State students, for the 
reason that no standard is given by which they are to be guided in 
making their choice. I take the liberty of respectfully suggesting 
that if the selections were directed to be made from the public 
schools of the several counties, according to the proficiency of pu- 
pils in such schools, not only would the Agricultural College be 
supplied with a better or more promising clats of students, but the 
appointments would, in general, fall upon youths better entitled to 
the berfefit. For instance, let the County Superintendent, in each 
county, designate to the Senator or Representative, not less than 
five, nor mere than ten, pupils of the public schools, who may have 
shown themselves most proficient in their studies, from which num- 
ber the State students shall be chosen. By such an arrangement 
not only will the College be relieved of much preparatory labor, but 
a very strong incentive to better application to their studies will 
be given to the pupils of the public schools. : 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
From what has been already said regarding the difficulty of pro- 
euring competent teachers, in all cases, it will hardly require an ar- 
gtument to demonstrate the need of an institution for the education 
and training of teachers. School teaching is a profession, for the 
successful practice of which—barring rare exceptional cases—a special 
preparation is as necessary as for that of the other learned profes- 
sions. Appreciating this fact and our condition, Dr. Sears, two 
years ago, proposed to appropriate annually the sum of six thousand 
dollars ($6,000) for the support of a State Normal School in Ten- 
nessee, provided the State would appropriate a like amount for the 
same purpose. A bill to this effect—that is, for the establishment 
of the school upon the terms proposed—passed the Senate, but, ow- 
ing to the crowded state of the calendar, was lost in the House. I 
am authorized byDr. Sears, in behalf of the Peabody Board, to renew
-P-A-G-E-22
[22] 
the proposition of last year, and I trust the Legislature will not. 
hesitate to avail itself of such valuable aid in so important an edu~ 
cational enterprise. The details of this proposition will, in due. 
time, be presented to the Legislature. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
Although not strictly within the purview of my official duty, I 
made an effort to obtain full statistics of the private schools taught 
within the State during the year. Directions to this effect were given 
in the blanks furnished to District Clerks and Treasurers for other 
statistics. The returns, however, were so incomplete and unsatis- 
factory as to have no statistical value, and I do not deem it proper’ 
te encumber this report with them. I may remark, however, that 
by a judicious application of the provisions of section 33 of. the 
school law, harmonious relations have been preserved between the 
private and public schools, with comparatively few exceptions. I. 
have uniformly recommended consolidation with good private schools. 
in all cases in which the public funds were not sufficient to supply 
the educational demands of communities; but I have strictly forbid- 
den the pro rata distribution of school moneys to parents and guar- 
dians, with permission to send their children or wards to whatever 
school they might select. Such a policy would be subversive of all 
system, and amount simply to a collection of school moneys to be 
re-distributed for the support of private schools. Two modes of 
consolidation, when the public funds are insufficient for an inde- 
pendent school, have been recommended: First, that the directors 
should contract with the proprietor or teacher of the private school, 
at a stated salary per month, to give free instruction in the element- 
ary branches, to all children of lawful school age within the sub- 
district, for so long a time as the public funds, at such rate, would 
last. Second, that the School Directors should themselves contract. 
to take entire control of the private school, making it free as to the 
branches prescribed in the school law, paying the teacher a stated 
salary per month, and themselves collecting tuition for the higher 
branches, for the benefit of the school, under the provisions of sec-~ 
tion 31 of the school law. I regard the latter mode as preferable 
in all cases in which it may be practicable, since the necessary and 
desired effect of an efficient Public School System must be to ulti- 
mately absorb the local private schools, making public teachers of 
the private ones—a result as much to the advantage of the private.
-P-A-G-E-23
[ 23 J 
teachers (giving them fixed and assured salaries instead of promis- 
cuous and uncertain patronage) as to the officers of the School Sys- 
tem. I may add that, by the policy pursued, much of the antici- 
pated antagonism between private and public schools has been 
avoided. 
A list of incorporated Schools, Colleges and Universities, not 
under control of public school officers, appears in the Appendix.: 
From the listare omitted such incorporated schools as were connected 
with the public system, by consolidation. The list may be oth- _ 
erwise incomplete, but, if so the deficiency may stimulate the omit- 
ted Institutions to make report the present year. The statistics 
given are derived from the Institutions themselves. It must be a 
source of gratification to every Tennesseean to note the recent 
rapid progress that has been made in the founding of new, and the 
recuperation of old, Institutions of learning, of high grade, within 
our State. So far as I have observed, these higher institutions have 
manifested a friendly interest in our Public School System. It would 
be hardly rational were they to feel otherwise. The effect of our 
elementary public schools is to open the intellectual eyes of thou- 
sands who would otherwise pass through life mentally blind to the 
possibility or desirability of escaping from their state of ignorance— 
much Jess of fitting themselves, by a liberal education, forthe higher 
pursuits of life. Within a few years, our Colleges and Universities 
will more sensibly appreciate the beneficial results of our system 
(if properly sustained and conducted) in the multiplied recruits that 
will apply for admission to their halls. 
UNDISTRIBUTED SCHOOL MONEYS. 
Astatement appears in the report of Comptroller Pennebaker, 
submitted to the last Legislature, which, I think, should be brought 
to the attention of the incoming General Assembly. On pages 50, © 
51, of said report, Mr. Pennebaker says: : 
“On the 30th of April, 1870, the Comptroller apportioned the 
amount due to common schools from Collectors, and balance due 
from 1866 to 1870, inclusive, amounting to $441,584.36. Warrants 
were issued soon after, for the full amount due. Collections amount- 
ing to about $150,000 have since been made, chiefly in Tennessee 
money, being balances on years previous to the present. The 
amount is sosmall that I have not distributed warrants, and await 
the orders of your Honorable Body.”
-P-A-G-E-24
[24] 
The facts stated in-the last two sentences quoted, are the ones that 
should receive Legislative attention. The last Legislature took no 
action in regard to the subject. A common opinion prevails that 
the sum of $150,000 referred to by Comptroller Pennebaker, was em- 
braced in the certificate of the Permanent School Fund, provided for 
by the present school law. But such is not the case. That certificate 
(for $2,512,500) embraces simply the original School Fund, ($1,- 
500,000) and the interest thereon, at the rate of six per cent. per 
annum, from October 11, 1861, to January 1, 1873, With the ex- 
ception of two counties (Washington and Greene) % no part of said 
$150,000, nor. of whatever may have since been collected under 
said tax, has been distributed. There are many teachers throughout 
the State, who taught schools during the time for which said moneys 
were collected, whose claims have never been paid and many of 
whom are clamorous for payment out of our present school moneys, 
At any rate, the money belongs to the counties, according to their 
scholastic population, and ought to be so distributed. I therefore 
suggest that inquiry be made into this matter, to the end that jus- 
tice may be done to all concerned. 
EXPENSES OF LAND SALES. 
By a provision of the Code of Tennessee—section 622—which 
was not repealed until the enactment of the present assessment law, 
it was provided, that, at sales of land for taxes, “if no person will 
bid the amount of taxes, costs and charges, the collector shall bid 
off the same in the name of the Treasurer, as Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, for the use of common schools; in which case, 
the fees shall be paid to the officers out of the common school fund, 
by the Treasurer, on the warrant of the Comptroller.” 
Under this section, the April apportionment of school moneys 
was diminished to the extent of $15,984, being the account of 
charges for the sales of lands, as above quoted. From the lands so 
bid in and charged for, the school fund has never received one 
dollar’s benefit. The assessment act of the last Legislature provides 
that the lands shall be bid in for the State in its own right, and, of 
course, the school fund will not be further taxed with the expenses 
of such profitless sales. But certainly the school fund is entitled to 
the benefit of whatever can be realized from a re-sale of the lands 
which, through a long series of years, have been purchased for its 
benefit and atits own expense. I respectfully suggest that a matter
-P-A-G-E-25
[25] 
is here presented worthy the attention and action of the Legislature. 
In this connection, allow me to suggest, also, that the payment 
of the poll taxes into the State Treasury for re-distribution, is a 
source of: much unnecessary inconvenience and expense, to say 
nothing of the injustice involved. I recommend, therefore, that 
the same provisions governing the taxes upon property, be applied 
to taxes upon polls. 
SCHOOL DEPOSITS IN THE BANK OF TENNESSEE. 
Upon investigating the history of school affairs in Tennessee, I 
found that at various times through a series of years antecedent’ to 
the late civil war, the Legislature of Tennessee had ordered the sales 
of numerous sections of school lands belonging to certain counties 
and districts in the State. The proceeds of these sales were directed, 
by the Legislature, to be deposited in the Bank of Tennessee, and 
invested in bonds for the benefit of the respective counties and 
districts, to which the lands belonged. Knowing that a suit was 
pending in the Supreme Court of the State, involving the various 
questions of right appertaining to, or growing out of, the affairs of 
said Bank, and fearing that, through neglect, the rights of the said 
counties and districts might be precluded, I requested Hon. James 
W. McHenry—who represents the county of Overton in said suit— 
to make general inquiry regarding the whole subject, and to furnish 
me with the result of his investigations. This he kindly agreed to do 
and his letter on the subject, which appears in the Appendix, will, no 
doubt, furnish valuable information to those interested. Inasmuch 
as the State undertook the sales of these lands and the investment of 
proceeds, through its own Bank, in special trust for the parties to 
whom the lands belonged, it has occurred to me, in view of the pos- 
sible ultimate liability of the State therefor, as proper thus to call. 
attention to the matter, in order that the Legislature, should it see 
fit to do so, may take such action as may be deemed necessary to 
protect the State in regard to the special trust, if possible, as against 
the assets of the Bank. The total amount of such deposits, accord- 
ing to the abstract furnished by the Trustee of the Bank, is $407,- 
617.76, 
CO-EDUCATION OF THE RACES. 
As has already been expressed several times, in this Report, our 
educational progress has, in various ways, been retarded by the at-
-P-A-G-E-26
[26 ] 
tempt of the National Congress, to force upon the several States, 
the co-education of the races, through the agency of the so-called 
“Supplemental Civil Rights Bill.” The provisions of that bill are 
so well known to the country—and especially to the people of Ten- 
nesse—that a statement of them here is deemed unnecessary. The 
necessary effect of the passage of such a measure is also equally well 
understood. It may not be improper, however, to put upon record 
a few facts in vindication of the impartiality of the educational 
policy of our State. 
Leaving the problem of the negro’s ultimate destiny in America 
to be solved in the future, and accepting the fact that he is now, by 
virtue of our organic law, a citizen of the State and Nation—vested 
with all the civil rights of the white man—and constituting a part 
of the governing power of the Nation, in like degree with the white 
man, to the extent of his numerical strength—from the highest of- 
ficér of Government to the lowest functionary of a civil district— 
the framers of our school law deemed it both wise and just- to pro- 
vide for him the means of being educated into a better condition of 
intelligence and good citizenship ; and this, too, in face of the fact 
that the cost of such educational privileges must be paid for, by the 
white tax-payers of the State, in the ratio of at least twenty dollars 
to one. The school law is absolutely impartial in its provisions, 
-as affecting the races. The same school age is prescribed for colored 
_ as for white children; they are counted alike in the apportionment 
of school moneys ; they are entitled to pursue the same studies ; 
they are subject to the same school’officers and ‘to the same general - 
school regulations, and no special regulations are tolerated that pre- 
fer the rights of one race to those of the other. Colored people are 
eligible as teachers, school directors, county superintendents, and 
State Superintendent, just as they are eligible to the civil offices of 
the State or General Government. The only distinction between 
the races recognizéd by our school law is in the mode of organizing 
the children into schools. Under the imperative provision of our 
State Constitution, and for the manifest good of both races, the law 
provides that white and colored children shall not be taught in the 
same school—just as it might have provided, without impairing its 
impartiality, that males and females should be taught in separate 
schools. The law, therefdre, is strictly impartial; for, if it be 
complained that colored children are not permitted to enter the
-P-A-G-E-27
[27] 
white schools, it might, with equal propriety and force, be com+ 
plained that white children are not permitted to enter the colored 
schools, as they are not. There are colored schools in some locali- 
ties where white children are not sufficiently numerous to constitute 
a school, and yet the law would not permit such white children to 
attend the colored schools. It is impossible so to locate the schools, 
at present, as to place them within convenient reach of all the 
children in every neighborhood in the State, owing to the sparse~ 
ness of the population in many sections. The consequence is, in 
some locailites one race suffers; in others, the other—the colored. 
more frequently, being the more sparse. I mention this to show 
that the only possible ground for complaint is, that the two races 
are kept separate in their schools, a provision without which no 
system of public schools would have been adopted, and to strike out 
which, were it possible under the constitution to do so, would now 
speedily and utterly destroy the whole fabric. 
From the outset, the people of the State, in the main, accepted 
the law with cheerfulness, and a general disposition to give it a fair 
trial was manifested. The school officers in the various counties, 
throughout the year, executed the law with due regard to the rights © 
of both races. Indeed, the complaints that have reached this office, 
from the colored people, have been far less numerous, even in pro- 
portion to population, than from the whites. It was not until the ; 
assembling of a Colored State Convention, at Nashville, in the 
month of April, 1874, that the harmony of our school system was 
seriously disturbed. In that convention, several speeches of a highly 
inflammatory character were delivered, and some very intemperate 
resolutions, demanding the passage of the Civil Rights Bill, in its 
entirety, adopted and promulgated. The effect was to arouse an 
intense feeling of indignation among the white people of the State, 
who were contributing so liberally to the education of colored chil- 
dren, as well as to discourage the school officers in their labor for © 
their good. Soon followed the passage of the Civil Rights Bill in 
the United States Senate, by an overwhelming vote. . This served 
to intensify the excitement. At a time when the passage of the 
Bill by the House of Representatives seemed imminent, I deemed 
it prudent, in view of the then disturbed condition of the public 
mind, to issue the following circular:
-P-A-G-E-28
[28] 
DEPARTMENT OF PusLic [nsTRucTION, 
State SUPERINTENDENT’S OFFICE, 
Nasuvii_e, May, 27, 1874. 
To Cownty Superintendents and Public School Directors throughout 
the State of Tennessee: 
The Civil Rights Bill, pending before the United States Congress, 
in its provisions concerning public schools, is in direct conflict with 
the law of Tennessee under which the public school system of the 
State is organized, and by which its officers are governed. It is 
furthermore in conflict with the 12th Section of Article 11 of the 
Constitution of Tennessee, which provides: “No school established 
* or aided under this section shall allow white and negro children to 
be received as scholars together in the same school.” So that what 
the bill commands, our State Constitution and public school law for- 
bid. That bill has already passed the Senate, and all the indica- 
tions point to its passage by the House of Representatives. 
In view of the fact that in many of the counties, schools, now 
closed, are expected to be re-opened for the summer session, in the 
-month of June, and inasmuch as it is desirable to avoid, as far as 
possible, the embarrassments that will necessarily follow the enact- 
ment of the Civil Rights Bill, [deem it the part of prudence to sug- 
gest that, for the present, and until further advised, no new contracts 
with teachers, for either white or colored schools, be entered into by 
school directors. By observing this suggestioi much complication 
and unnecessary expense may be avoided. , 
Should the Civil Rights Bill fail to pass, then no-serious harm can 
have resulted from this admonition.: Skould it become a law, in its 
present shape, then further instructions from this office will become 
necessary, and will be promptly given. 
Very respectfully, 
JNO. M. FLEMING, 
. State Superintendent. 
This circular, which was advisory in its nature, was designed’ to 
accomplish, first, the purpose set out in its text, and secondly, to,in- 
dicate, in an official way, the utter impracticability of maintaining a 
State system of public schools in Tennessee, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Civil Rights Bill. It was thought such a presen~ 
tatioa of the case might arrest the attention, and help to stay the 
action, of such advocates of the bill as professed to be the friends of 
popular education ; and “there is reason for believing that, in this 
regard, it was not altogether without effect. At any rate, no serious 
harm resulted from the promulgation of the document. Congress 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
[28] 
adjourned without passing the bill, and public school operations went 
‘on, though “ under a heavy pull,” for the rest of the year. 
It is hardly necessary to state that were a mingling of the two 
races in our public schools tolerated by our State Constitution, it 
could never be desired or sustained by our people. They cannot 
be brought to regard the schools as merely civil organizations, sub- 
ject only to political government. The school is too close to the 
family circle not to be subject, in a great degree, to social laws and 
influences. There are certain well-felt social incompatibilities and 
repulsions, which neither legislation nor judgments of courts can 
reconcile or destroy; and were it permissible to direct, by law, the 
organization of mixed public schools (as to color,) they would not 
be attended; and were they attended, the result would be rather a 
juvenile war of races than-a profitable rivalry in studies. So that, 
if the mere pendency of the Civil Rights Bill in Congress, with a 
possibility of its passage, has already begotten such hurtful appre- 
hensions, it may be taken asa fact indisputable, that its final. pas- 
sage and approval by the President, would work the almost instan- 
taneous death of our present school] system. 
It may be said that the Civil Rights Bill is unconstitutional; that 
Congress has no right, by law, to override or nullifiy the organic law 
of a State; much Jess to invade the social domain and. attempt to. 
govern the tastes and instincts of our people, according to™ts will. 
Grant all this, cheerfully. And yet, with a premium of five hun- 
dred dollars offered to each informer, in case of a violation of any 
provision of the Civil Rights Bill, and a liability resting upon each 
one of the eleven thousand public school officers and teachers of the 
State, to be arrested, taken from his home to Knoxville, Nashville, 
or Memphis, to be prosecuted before the United States judicial au- 
thorities, at heavy expense to himself in any event of the pros- 
ecution, it would be but the effort of folly or madness to attempt to 
maintain a profitable system of public instruction. It should be 
borne in mind that public schools, dependent upon continued popu- 
lar favor for support, and in our present stage of progress, are like 
tender plants that require gentle handling and tender culture. Pub- 
lie school officers cannot maintain their schools through law suits ; 
and, even should they be willing to subject themselves to prosecution, 
the staunchest friends of popular education would abandon all hope 
of success under such embarrassments—for, although a test case
-P-A-G-E-30
[ 30] 
might be made in the courts, this would not, meanwhile, relieve the 
other officers and teachers from liability to information, arrest and 
prosecution. 
The school law of Tennessee is not a thing of sudden and spon- 
taneous growth. It is the result of much earnest effort, and there 
are yet local difficulties in the way. While it has made encouraging 
progress and obtained a foot-hold from which it may hope to make 
still further advances—if let alone—it could not abide the wasting 
process of protracted judicial proceedings and prosper. Before a final 
decision could be reached, even if adverse to the Civil Rights Law, 
the effect of the law would have been felt in such a prostration of 
the system, that it would require years, probably, to resuscitate it. 
Tt was. in apprehension of such necessary results, that I issued the 
circular reproduced above. 
At the time of sending in this Report, Congress has taken no 
further action on the Civil Rights Bill, and I will not so far antici- 
pate hostile legislation as to now recommend any special policy to 
be pursued in the event of the final passage and approval of the 
bill. Should such a calamity befall us, the Legislature will be then 
in session, and will be competent to take entire jurisdiction of the 
whole subject. For the present, I prefer to trust that our school 
system, at least, will be spared so deadly a blow. 
COUNTY: REPORTS. ~ ’ 
County Superintendents are required to make annual reports to 
the State Superintendent, on or before the first day of October, of 
school operations in their respective counties, for the year ending 
the 31st day of August preceding. Owing to unavoidable difficul- 
ties in many of the counties, the Superintendents were unable to 
forward their reports within the time prescribed by law, and this 
delinquency has caused much delay in the preparation of this Report. 
For the sake of brevity, I have been compelled to digest and con- 
dense the County Reports, giving substantially such facts as, in the 
language of the law,“ may tend to show the degree of success and 
‘usefulness of the system.” It is to be regretted that, in some par- 
ticulars, a few of the reports will be found to be not so full as 
prescribed by law. 
I may be petmitted here to remark that the official intercourse 
between this office and the County Superintendencies has been uni~
-P-A-G-E-31
[31] 
formly of the most pleasant character. No instance of a breach of 
official courtesy is now remembered. : 
AMENDMENTS TO THE SCHOOL LAW. 
Except as herein before suggested, I have, at this time, no radical 
changes in our school law to recommend. The law is fundamentally 
a good one. It issimplein its leading provisions and appointments, 
and the people are just becoming somewhat familiar with its gen- 
eral provisions. Radical changes in the structure of the law would 
tend: to create confusion. Nevertheless, there are several matters 
of mere detail, not before referred to, in regard to which the law 
might be very profitably modified. But these are points that may 
well be brought to the attention of the School Committees of the 
Legislature, without encumbering this Report with a recital of them. 
CONCLUSION, 
Before closing this Report—which I have endeavored to make as 
brief as a compliance with the requirements of the law and the in- 
terests involved would permit—allow me to express to. your 
Excellency my thanks for your uniform courtesy, and to bear 
testimony to your lively interest, during my term of office, in the 
success of Tennessee’s educational system. May the plant, that be- 
gan its growth under your auspices, be tenderly and faithfully nur- 
‘tured by the State, until it shall develop into a sturdy, stately tree, 
bearing richest fruits for generations to come! 
Of the unfailing . courtesies of the other State officers, I desire, 
also, to make public acknowledgment ; and to return thanks to the 
newspapers of the State—especially to the Daily Republican Banher 
and Daily Union and American—for the valuable aid they have so 
cheerfully rendered, in disseminating needed educational intelligence 
among our people. 
I have the honor to be, your Excellency’s obedient servant, 
JNO. M. FLEMING, 
State Superintendent.

1873, nothing ; for 1874, on property, 10 cents per hundred dollars. 
The County Superintendent reported October, 1873: 
A great portion of this county has been nearly destitute of schools 
ever since the repeal of the school law of 1867 ; though there have 
  
*Elected in place of former Superintendent, James C. Scruggs, who resigned in 
July, 1874.
-P-A-G-E-36
[36] 
been afew very good schools kept up by individuals, during that 
time, from three to ten months in the year. As a general thing, the 
educational interests of the county have been shamefully neglected. 
The county is poorly furnished with school-houses, and this isa great 
drawback to the present schools. There are probably not more 
than a dozen houses in the county, that are fit to teach in, the re- 
mainder being from poor to very poor, and there are two or three 
localities that are having no schools this year, on account of having 
no houses. But considering all the circumstances, I think the pres- 
ent system is working very well, and is calculated to do much good,. 
if it can be kept going. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
We have forty-one schools, as you will see perreport. The most 
of them are doing very well. If we had money to run our schools 
five months in the year, we would soon have a change for the better 
in this mountain country.

10 cents per one hundred dollars; for 1874: on polls, $1; on pro- 
perty, 18 cents per one hundred dollars. No county election held 
for school tax. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
As to the condition of our county educationally, prior to the 
inauguration of the present system, it may be well to state, that two 
years ago, our people voted down the school tax by an overwhelm- 
ing majority. Many of them refused to vote at all, the sentiment 
was so dead upon the question. Now, I regard the cause as mainly 
won, if I can keep my health, so that I can work as I want to. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1874: 
Our schools this year will average five or six months.

-P-A-G-E-38
[38] 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
We have had no public and few private schools for several 
years. I think, in the course of next month, we will have all our: 
schools under way. There will be about forty in the county. I 
think we will have plenty of school houses by the time we com-. 
mence the second session. I think a few districts will levy an ad- 
ditional tax, and that our County Court will levy a county tax for: 
1874. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1874: 
There was an election on school tax ordered, and held only in 
a portion of the districts. There has not been an official report 
made, but I was informed that the tax was voted down by four to- 
one. There were no private schools of any note taught. A few 
public schools were prolonged by subscription.

amined, 93. County. tax for school purposes for 1873, nothing; for 
1874, nothing. School tax was voted down by the people, both in 
1873 and 1874. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1873: 
The school districts, in the past, have had but few schools, and 
poor government, while the people looked at the schools of this 
county as short lived, and paid little attention to the education of 
the masses. Now schools are organized to give.every child, both 
black and white, a chance to be at a public free school. The oppo- 
sition that the people manifested toward public schools, has greatly 
subsided. The schools were generally late in starting, owing to our 
disorganized condition, (no Directors in the county. until after 
August,) and school-houses had to be repaired and built. There 
would have been a much larger enrollment in school, and a more 
regular attendance, if schools could have been started earlier. We 
have a Teachers’ Institute organized, and hope to have a good at- 
tendance. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1874: 
This county is somewhat behind as to public school operations. 
Our teachers are generally of moderate attainments; yet making 
some advancement, The public school fund, save that of the State,
-P-A-G-E-40
[40] 
has been quite slow coming up, and some funds for the year 1873 
are behind. The people have been pressed, and are looking with 
some interest to public schools. It is to be hoped that, this county 
will do better in the future, as school-houses are being builtin many 
districts.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
Want of attendance is a fault much to be deplored in some

voted school tax by large majority. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
The educational condition of this county, previous to the intro- 
duction of the new system of public schools, was very discouraging. 
The former system of public schools was almost an entire failure. 
Considering the many disadvantages under which we have to labor, 
the most of our schools have been working very well. The teachers, 
with some few exceptions, are prosecuting their work with zeal and 
energy ; and are advancing their students as rapidly as could be ex- 
pected under existing circumstances. There are visible signs of im~ 
provement throughout the county. Our Directors are active and 
take a lively interest in the schools, and the education of the children 
in the county.. But there are hindrances to the progress and success 
of the present system. We are convinced that the present school 
system will prove a failure to a considerable degree, unless some 
plan can be devised to induce the people to send their children to 
school, and build suitable school-houses in every district in the 
county. The next Legislature should pass a law to this effect.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
A proposition to levy a county tax of two mills on all taxable 
property, one dollar on polls, and one-fourth of State tax on privi- 
leges, was submitted by our County Court to the people, but was de~ 
feated ; for tax, 656; against, 1,387; although the vote showed a 
rapidly growing sentiment in favor of the public school system, 
as a similar proposition, in 1872, received from the county but sixty- 
five votes in its favor. 
I take pleasure in reporting the fact that, while a very few of the 
Boards have failed to organize, most of the Directors have been 
prompt in the discharge of their duties, and have shown a deep in- 
terest in the prosperity of our public schools. Meetings of the 
County Board of Directors are held as often as circumstances re- 
quire,

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
When I was elected County Superintendent, (April, 1873), there 
was not a public school in Carter county. There was no system of 
public instruction in the county, and but little public money. Sev- 
eral Districts had no Directors, and some had not reported their 
scholastic population for several years. 
Under the new law the County Court levied an additional mill on 
property, and twenty-five cents on polls, There are, at present, 
thirty-one schools in the county, all public schools, or District 
schools united with graded schools. The pupils are becoming more 
interested in the cause of education, and I think the system bids fair 
to be a success. 
The Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The County Court has acted in sucha manner as to greatly para- 
lyze the school system of the county. One term of the Court they 
will pass an order in the interest of schools, and then the next term 
they will reverse it. I do not know, when I effect a move in the 
interest of public schools, that it will be permanent. I give it as 
my opinion that’the farther the school system can be removed from 
the County Courts the better it will be.

Our schools promised well at the beginning; but when the ap- 
portionment from the permanent fund was known, the whole sys- 
tem was thrown into a panic, and most of the schools closed. The 
County Court refused to levy a county tax, deferring action till Jan- 
uary proximo. The school system has bitter, strong opposition. I 
have rowed against wind and tide. Its friends think the prospect 
more favorable for next year. ,

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
The people in portions of the county, before the present system 
’ was enacted, were alive to the work of trying to establish good 
schools; but in other portions—and, I might say with safety, in a 
greater portion of the county—there was but little or no interest 
taken in the cause of education. So that, when we first began to 
enforce the present system, we had a good deal of opposition to con- 
tend with; but I am proud to say that a good many of its former 
enemies are now its friends. Our school-houses are generally in a 
dilapidated condition—not at all suited for winter schools. The 
County Court did not levy an additional tax on property; neither 
did they submit the proposition to a vote of the people; therefore 
our schools were compelled to close, at from three to four months. 
I think, however, that we will get all right by next year.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Under the law previous to the one now in force this county or- 
ganized public schools in September, 1870; so that our present 
‘ school operations, instead of being an innovation on our old sys- 
tem, are simply a continuation of what has been in vogue since Sep- 
tember, 1870.: 
The public schools of this city, and adjacent town of Edgefield, 
are noted for their thoroughness in every thing relating to school- 
houses, school appliances, school discipline, and instruction. In 
several districts of the county graded schools have been established, 
continuing ten months in the year. Four districts at present are 
not running schools, having kept them in operation all summer, dnd 
propose to begin at the beginning of the ensuing year. The schools 
in the country districts are continued, on an average, seven months 
in the year. 
From county tax there was raised and expended last year about 
$77,000; and in the city of Nashville, by a tax of her own, $26,000 ; 
and in Edgefield, $4,000; making a total of-$107,000. This sum 
will be increased, the present school year, from State poll tax, and 
interest on bonded debt, say $12,000, and from increased county 
’ tax on polls, about $1,000, making a total of $120,000, which will 
-be realized the present year. These estimates, probably, may be 
more than realized for they are made upon a minimum basis. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The above statistics show a better status for the public schools 
-of this county, than exhibited by the operations of any preceding 
year, both for the schools of the cities of Nashville and Edgefield, 
and of the country districts.

- Our schools have not been in operation during the year, as long- 
as the public school law contemplated, but considering the prejudice. 
that has heretofore existed in our county against public schools, 
think we have done remarkably well. I hope and believe that our 
County Court will levy a tax sufficient to run our schools at least 
five months during the year, provided the “Civil Rights Bill” 
does not become a law.

The Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
There has been a decided improvement in attendance this year 
over the last. Iam satisfied that there has been at least 75 per 
cent. of the scholastic population in attendance, and the schools have 
given entire satisfaction. There has been a decided improvement in

went in favor of tax by large majorities. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
The civil districts are organized as school districts, and duly in- 
corporated by the Chancery Court, with township privileges, etc. 
The object, or plan is to have one principal or high school centrally 
located, and as many primary or assistant schools as may be neces- 
sary in each district. These schools are to be strictly graded, and 
by their intimate connection with each other, will constitute one 
school only in the district, with one principal teacher, and the nec- 
essary assistants for each grade. The younger pupils can be accom- 
modated nearer home with school facilities in the primary schools, 
while the larger and more advanced pupils, who are better able to 
go farther are admitted only in the central school, where ail the 
grades—even a high school course—are taught. The plan has been 
_ thoroughly discnssed in the county, and meets with general favor. 
It commends itself to the popular approval, because it provides for 
a thorough and complete education of our youth at home, who are 
no longer subjected to the inconvenience and expense (to say 
nothing of the pernicious influence) of attending the “so-called” 
seminaries and colleges in our towns and cities. The plan is not 
fully perfected, but will require some time to put it in thorough 
operation. In the absence of any law or regulation on the subject, 
we can only expect its progress to be gradual. With one or two dis- 
tricts, however, organized upon this plan, othérs in succeeding years 
will imitate their example, and copy after them. Three or four dis- 
tricts have already adopted the plan, and are gradually working 
themselves up to a graded school system. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The total enrollment is 80 per cent. of scholastic population } 
daily attendance, 582 per cent. of population, and 73 per cent. of 
enrollment; cost per pupil per month, $1.21; per day, 6 cents. 
Average per month in subscription or pay schools, $2.50 each; cost 
of 5,322 pupils, 6.5 months, $86,482.50; difference in favor of pub- 
lie schools, $38,612.95. The monthly salary of teachers should be 
graded according to the average daily attendance, at 5 to 8 cents per 
day for each pupil. With a fixed salary per month teachers become 
indifferent as to the daily attendance, and many will continue days
-P-A-G-E-58
[58] 
and weeks with a few pupils. To make him interested in his school, 
let his pay depend upon the attendance. , 
Contracts with teachers (and others) were made in advance of the 
collections, and orders issued, which, if not in excess of 3 of the 
pro rata share of the district, are endorsed and taken up in payment 
of taxes. The orders so taken up are collected and paid back to 
the clerk of the district, upon each apportionment. This was deemed 
advisable by the directors, owing to the scarcity of money. The 
indebtedness .($18,494.33) is less than the deficiency in the uncol- 
lected taxes of 1873. Usually, before July and August, the funds 
collected are exhausted, and at' this time, the greatest demand is 
made to open the public schools. Owing to a change in law, defer- 
ring the collections until October, this is unavoidable, without a sus- 
pension of the schools for nine months.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
The passage of the school law, at the last session of the Legislature, 
found Giles county under a system of private schools. These schools 
were generally taught by teachers of ability and experience. They 
were, however, wanting in uniformity of method and permanency of 
organization. Their patronage was fluctuating, and their methods of 
instruction and discipline unsettled, changing with every change of 
teachers. This produced much confusion and unnecessary expense, 
and seriously injured the progress of pupils. They were also very 
unequally distributed over the county. The average cost per scholar, 
as near as I can ascertain it, was about $2.50 or $3.00 per month ; 
and in some places $4.00 or $5.00 per month for the ordinary En- 
glish branches. As may be gathered from the accompanying gta- 
tisties, the average cost per scholar, under the present public system, 
is $1.19 per month in the same branches. 
In the inauguration of a new system, it was to be feared that 
much temporary confusion and injury would result from a collision 
between public and private schools. Yet, so completely has this 
anticipated danger been averted by the judicious management of 
the Directors, that the public-system was substituted for the private 
system, almost without a jar. There are now, so far as I can learn, 
only two private schools in Giles county which have not been con- 
solidated with the public schools. This arrangement has supplied 
71 school-houses free of rent. 
The experience of the present year would seem to indicate that 
-the period from about September 15 to November 15, should be 
avoided in the school terms of cotton districts. The present school 
fund of this county will sustain the schools an average of about 
seven months. 
The public-schools, I think, have been efficient, and have given 
general satisfaction. In my opinion, they are growing steadily in 
favor, as their economy, uniformity of system, and improved meth- 
ods are gradually developed and recognized. 
Nore.—Under the head of teachers employed, several are reported twice—the 
same teachers being reported from different districts, as employed at different pe- 
riods. : :

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Nearly seven-eighths of those in attendance on the free schools com- 
menced the session in the alphabet, but since that time have made 
praiseworthy progress. The interest the children manifest in their 
studies, and the eagerness with which they drink in the instruction 
offered them under the present system, is sufficient evidence that free 
schools here are attended with beneficial results, if conducted properly. 
It is hardly necessary to say that heretofore the free schools have been 
almost equivalent to no schools at all to the children here, because 
of the inattention they received from those whose duty it was to di- 
rect and inspect their progress. 
Every thing considered, we have a better prospect now for the 
coming people of this county, than at any time since the war. The 
people, the main lever by whieh . our schools are bid to work, are 
’ awake to their interest and the interest of generations yet unborn.

We now have an assessed fund of more than twice the above

While our schools are not what we would have them, they have 
been made what they are since the law of March, 1878, has goxe 
into effect. I am satisfied that there are one thousand more earnest, 
effective, and working advocates of common schools in this county 
to-day, than at any time prior; in the history of our State. The 
cause of common schools is gaining popularity, and awakening an 
interest heretofore unfelt. If the present system can be cherished,

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Since 1861 we have had but few schools, privaté or public, and 
they have been loosely conducted—almost avithout discipline ; so 
much so that little good was derived from them. In short, the frea 
schools we have had prior to the organization of the present system, 
were signal failures to such an extent that the people had almost 
come to the conclusion that little or no good could be derived from 
them. Hence, up to the organization of the present’ system,. the 
county was rapidly growing in illiteracy. .. 
Under the old law, the County Court, time and again, year after 
year, ordered an election to be held for the purpose of electing 
school commissidners. After many attempts, five out of fourteen 
districts elected said officers; but the majority of them gave the 
matter no attention, while some of them refused to act. Such was 
the interest manifested in our county by the greater portion of the 
best citizens, up to August, 1873. 
About the last of August, 1873, schools were thoroughly organ- 
ized throughout the entire county, and, at this date, prospects are far 
more flattering thari they ever were before. Good citizens are 
working in the cause with zeal and energy.

Owing to a lack of money in paying off our teachers for 1873, 
the interest which was so boldly manifested by most of our best cit- 
izens in school matters, has almost ceased, and much prejudice is. 
being aroused against free schools.

Our best teachers are not teaching, because the money is not sure; 
consequently our schools are being taught by those who are ill 
fitted for the business.

the county, and election for school Directors was held. From this 
time I commenced establishing schools under the new law, with 
some degree of success. Licensed some teachers who did not meet 
the requirements of the law. 
All was moving in the direction of success, until the County 
Court refused to levy a tax for school purposes, which virtually an- 
nulled the Schoo] Law, stopped my operations, and suspended the 
schools already established. We never had better prospects for 
schools in all the history of the county. Directors and teachers had 
begun to work with unrelenting zeal and energy, and the people re- 
joiced in the opportunity afforded. But, alas! the Acts of the Leg- 
islature are overruled by those of a dignified and sagacious County - 
Court, and hence all our- educational prospects and glory are, for 
the time being, blighted.

The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
We have had better schools this year than ever before, and there 
is more interest upon the subject of education throughout the county 
than has heretofore been characteristic of our people, and we hope- 
fully look forward to the time when educational facilities will be the 
common heritage of all—the rich and poor alike. But much will 
have to be done in amending the School Law, before this will be- 
accomplished.

The report of Hon. John Eaton, Jr., Superintendent of Public

‘tion of this county was 6,299. No. of schools opened, 42. Total 
No. pupils enrolled, 1 (798, 
Since he made his report, a considerable portion of this county has 
been stricken off, to help form the county of Hamblen.! The remain- 
‘ing portion has taken but little interest in education since his report 
until the present School Law went into operation. The Law of 
1870 proved almost an entire failure in this county—333 cents to 
the pupil being the only pro rata allowance made in the past three 
years. 
The school interest of this county was undoubtedly fast losing 
ground ; and if the present School Law had not been enacted, I am 
unable to tell how far we would have drifted from the interest we 
should take in the public schools of this county. | 
I am happy to say an active interest is now being manifested 
throughout the county in regard to public schools. It is to be hoped 
that our next Legislature will not repeal, but aménd our present 
School Law, so that, asa State, we may rise in the educational 
standard, and take such a position among our sister States, as will 
do us honor in the future. 
‘The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
A much larger attendance would have resulted if it had not been 
for epidemic diseases peculiar to children, prevailing in the county 
‘during the school months, Taking it all in all, the school system 
has resulted quite favorably in this county.

~The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
I am happy to report that the prejudice heretofore existing against. 
a system of schools supported by taxation is rapidly giving way, and 
had it not been for the unfortunate agitation of the “Civil Rights. 
Bill,” dld Haywood might, by this time, have been set down as. 
overwhelmingly in favor of public schools. 
There are but few public schools-houses in the county, but the 
different religious denominations have very generously allowed the. 
use of their churches, and property-owners the use & vacant houses, 
‘without any charge for rent.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
But few of our public schools are in operation. The people are 
waiting for money enough to pay for a whole session. We have a 
fair number of good private schools now in operation in this county, 
several of which will embrace the public schools by special arrange- 
ments, during the remainder of the present scholastic year. The 
Legislature must levy enough to carry on the schools five months, 
‘or the system will be only 4 partial success. Money enough levied 
by authority of law—not by County Courts—to run the schools five 
months will insure the perfect success of public schools in this part 
of the State. : 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The patrons of nearly all the schools supplemented the public 
fund by adding subscriptions, and some few schools were run five 
months, others two or less.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
“ But few public schools have been opened and taught in this” 
county since the war; they were established under former laws, 
during 1867~68 and ’69, but there have been none since then, I be- 
lieve. A few private schools, however, have been in operation in 
some of the districts, but they have not been general over the 
county. Great apathy, and want of interést in public schools ex- 
~ isted up to the adoption of the present law. All confidence seemed 
to have been lost in the efficiency of any public system to educate 
the children; and the new law, some said, would be like all the 
othets—a failure ; and the school fund would amount to nothing at 
last. Some opposition was expressed, and used, against levying an 
additional county tax ; but it was overcome, and our County Court’ 
levied the same on property as the State, and fifty cents on the poll; 
they omitted the levy on privileges. 
As soon as the County Court appointed me County Superintend- 
ent, at the April Term of this year, I went immediately to work to 
arouse an interest in publie schools. I am happy to state that I 
found a better feeling and interest than I had anticipated. As soon 
as the new law was adopted, a new interest seemed to have been 
awakened in the minds of the people: though some pposition had 
been expressed by some. Yet it soon gave way, and a feeling of re- 
proach seemed to have come upon some for not taking more interest 
in this important matter sooner. Their children had been neglected, 
and suffered to grow up in ignorance,from their great desire to re- 
pair their losses, sustained by the war. 
From my report it appears that sixty schools are in ‘operation in 
this county. The school-houses generally are in bad repair for 
winter schools; yet a good feeling seems to be manifested to make 
them comfortable. School furniture generally is on the old style, 
yet some have comfortable seats, black-boards, and other appliances 
for their school-rooms.
-P-A-G-E-74
[74] 
On the 20th of September last, the teachers met at Centreville, 
and formed a Teachers’ Institute by electing officers, etc., and hav- 
ing their meetings monthly. Their second meeting came off last. 
Saturday. A good feeling prevailed, and their zeal in the interest 
of the schools was unabated. 
A uniform course of text-books has been adopted in the county. ° 
They were suggested by the teachers, and adopted by the Board of 
Directors. 
There seems to be now a growing interest in educational matters, 
which I hope will continue until we have a permanent system estab- 
lished—embracing ten months in the year. 
_ There has been some difficulty in obtaining colored teachers. 
The present law seems to be generally approved. I don’t think 
the Legislature, on first trial, could improve matters any by adopt- 
ing another ; and the general desire seems to be to attempt no new 
law, but to retain the present, and lop off its defects as they may 
appear. \

leges, one-half the State tax; for 1874: same tax was levied by thi 
‘County Court, but rescinded in October on account of drouth. Ni 
election on school tax yet held. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Prior to the “new law,” our county could boast of few, indeec| 
of but two or three communities that continued a regular schoc 
throughout the year. Other communities continued schools twe 
three, or five months in the year, according. to local circumstance: 
Averaging the various schools, we could not report thaf the count: 
sustained more than six or seven annual schools. Teachers hav. 
had to contend with this disadvantage: Having taught a session i) 
one community, it became necessary to remove to another, or tak: 
up some other business, until the people desired another session ti 
be taught. / 
Our houses are generally in bad condition, but we are building 
some new houses, and repairing others. I think I may safely re- 
port the condition of public school-houses twenty per cent. better 
than they were eight months since. 
Some of our teachers are men who have devoted their entire en- 
ergies to the cultivation of the minds of the young, and they are 
now succeeding admirably with the schools submitted tothem. As 
a whole we report our teachers at their posts, and doing well. They 
are anxious to advance themselves, and are willing to conform to 
_ suggestions for improvement. 
The enrollment of pupils is a little above fifty per cent. of the 
scholastic population, but the attendance will fall far below this. 
Pupils ave uniformly obedient. Scarcely an instance. has occurred 
that required harsh measures, and nota pupil has been dismissed 
from a public school this fall. There is a general spirit of emula- 
tion that is working well. 
Our schools are managed with firmness and kindness. We have 
endeavored on all occasions, to impress upon the minds of the chil- 
dren that they are superior, intelligent beings, avd susceptible of in~ 
definite cultivation ; and that very soon they will have to take an 
active part on the stage of life. They have listened to the lectures 
delivered to them with much interest, and the impression made upon 
théir minds have been good and lasting. 
‘Our people were formerly greatly opposed to the public schools, 
There yet remains astrong opposition element. Many persons op~  
-P-A-G-E-77
[77] 
posed the system for want of confidence in it; but on seeing the 
success. attending the inauguration, have quietly become friendly 
to it. 
It is due our teachers to state that they have organized a “Teach- 
ers’ Institute” forthe county. This promises to accomplish much 
good in developing the theory and practice of teaching, and the 
general and social advancement of teachers. - 
The Superintendent has been able to visit some of the schools as 
often as three times; the most of them twice; and all at least once. 
The irregularity of visits has been occasioned by the manner of 
opening our schools, which began as early as July, and continued on - 
down to the present time. Every cémmunity in our county has 
been supplied with a school save two. In visiting the schools, the 
Superintendent has examined classes, lectured the school, conferred 
priv ately with the teachers and directors, and ‘made general in- 
quiry in regard to the prosperity of each school. His whole time 
_and energies have been given to the promotion of the success of the 
system. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
Our schools have generally-been very successful, and have accom- 
plished much good. Our teachers have been attentive and prompt. 
The term, however, was entirely too short to obtain the best results. 
County Institutes have been attended with quite limited results. 
The Superintendent devoted his entire time to visiting the schools. 
He made the circuit of the county three times. The various’classes 
were examined, the schools lectured, and the teachers conferred with 
privately. The present law has, in general, worked well. Very 
many of our people oppose the Superintendency, State and county, 
Many oppose the county tax, preferring the district tax, but will not 
levy both. Some accept the law, but want a compulsory act an- 
nexed, 
Our County Court will rescind the present Jevy, and submit it to 
the people. Jt will be lost. A portion of our county is almost. 
destitute of a crop, hence this action by the County Court. We 
commenced many of our schools this fall, but have closed them.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Ihave just finished canvassing the county the second time sincé 
the schools opened. I found it difficult to get up a sufficient num- 
ber of facts regarding the number and prosperity of the schools of 
any former year to institute a comparison between the same, and 
those of the present year. My information is, however, that last: 
year there were forty or forty-one schools in Jefferson county, all 
told. This year sixty-nine free schools have been organized already, 
and one more will be organized next Monday. You will remember 
my county has only fifty school districts, in every one of which, 
with one single exception, there has been a white free school organ- 
ized, besides the colored ones, With three exceptions, all of the 
sixty-nine schools have thus far moved smoothly én; and in those 
the troubles were not very momentous, not fatal at all. 
To set on foot, these. schools, and to keep them in good running 
order, has cost much toil and thought. I am continually in the 
field, traveling from school to school, watching every vicinity and 
school; and to this itinerant toil is to be attributed my success in 
opening so large a number of schools in “ Old Jefferson.” 
The schools, I am sorry to. say, are at present somewhat thinly 
attended, owing to the pressure upon our farmers in seeding and 
gathering their corn. 
The grade of scholarship of our. teachers has not been entirely 
satisfactory ; hence my petition to the County Court for a permit to 
open a “normal school” at the close of our present free schools 
(which will be about the 1st of February next) for the sole purpose 
of thoroughly drilling teachers preparatory to opening the schools 
next year. My desire was to carry on said school as Superintendent, 
~ charging no fees for my labor. 
Taking all things into consideration, I regard the common school 
cause in this county as growing in interest, and the schools as be- 
coming more efficient. In my humble opinion, the present school 
law is more efficient than any former one; and it owes nearly, if 
not all, its advantages over preceding ones to its forcing power; and 
LT heartily wish it had just a little more of it. 
Owing to the vast amount of out-door work I have to do, I have 
not had time to organize a Teachers’ Institute,” believing that I
-P-A-G-E-81
[8t] —_ 
could accomplished more by traveling over the entire county, and 
canvassing with the parents of the children. My success, in com-. 
parison with that of Superintendents who, have traveled less, and 
formed “ Teachers’ Institutes,” will decide for or against my course.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Previous Educational Condition—At the time of my election, last 
April, I found the educational condition of Knox county much bet- 
ter, doubtless, than that of a majority of the counties in the State. 
An organization had been effected under the late county law, and a 
sufficient tax was levied by the County Court to run the schools from 
four to five months in the year. Yet there was a decided lack of 
thoroughness, resulting from a want of general supervision. No 
‘County Superintendent had been elécted. The county board of 
education, composed of district commissioners, was too unwieldy, 
_and consequently inefficient for almost all practical purposes. The 
schools were opened with irregularity—some not at all during the 
year, and those teachers who were even disposed to do more than 
nominal labor, sttuggled on alone, under much adversity, with little 
_-or no attention or encauragement. 
Examination of Teachers.—My first work was to thoroughly ac- 
quaint myself with the educational condition and wants of the 
‘county. In July, I began the examination of teachers. My exam~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
[83] 
’ inations were, for the most part, written, and the papers of appli- 
cants put on file. One hundred and forty-seven examinations were 
~ made, up to the 15th of October. Of these, sixteen applicants were 
rejected as incompetent ; and ten, who-fuiled to reach the required 
average, were granted “emergency” certificates to teach colored 
schools, for which qualified instructors could not be obtained. The, 
remainder received regular certificates. Some who failed, were af- 
terward re-examined and reached the requisite standard, A few 
with low grade, by study and re-examination, also raised their aver- 
age. Ope teacher of a high school was granted a certificate with-_ 
out examination, and consequently without a gradation of the 
branches required: to be taught. No irregular certificate has been 
issued to teach a white school, as there is aslight overplus of teach- 
ers for this class. In examining, I did not ask very difficult ques- 
tions, but required full and explicit answers. The teachers, for the 
‘most part, have had limited opportunities and experience, and con- 
sequently the grade is generally very low. The highest attained, 
is nine and one-eighth, out of a maximum of ten. Comparatively 
few reach above eight, and rarely any above nine. Of course, no 
perfect certificates have been or ever should be granted. I have 
found the greatest deficiency of teachers to be in practical and syste- 
matic penmanship, and especially the latter. Some districts, in. 
hiring’ their teachers, pay according to grade, other things being 
equal. It is desirable that this system be established throughout the 
county, since, besides being the only just and true mode, it will be 
a great incentive to teachers to qualify themselves properly. 
The Opening.—In a few districts the commissioners who held over 
under the old law, opened schools before the election of Directors 
in August. A very lively interest was manifested in the election, 
throughout the county, and the result was the election, for the most 
part, of good and competent men as Directors. I called them to- 
gether at the county site, immediately after the election, as per your 
instructions, when a general organization and concert of action-was . 
effected. It was decided that the text-books selected and introduced 
in most of the county schools, by the late county. board, be retained. 
Schools were soon organized in every district. There was some de- 
lay.in organizing the colored schools, from a lack of teachers. It 
was finally found impossible to obtain competent teachers, and 
special certificates, as referred to. above, were granted as a last resort.
-P-A-G-E-84
[84]. 
Moét of these are now organized, where there isa sufficient number- 
of pupils. ‘Those children which are isolated and remote, will be 
provided for in the best manner possible. I would suggest that the 
law be amended so that, in such cases, the money may accumulate 
in a sufficient amount to employ a teacher, and open a school, even 
though the number of scholarg be very small. 
Sub-District Difficulties.—In opening the schools, it was, at times,. 
difficult to secure a satisfactory sub-division of the districts, and 
centrally located houses. Many houses had been built without re— 
ference to this object. Petty quarrels in the past, often resulted in. 
the building of-a house in an extreme end of the sub-division, by 
the dominant party. This has had a tendency detrimental to cen- 
tralization ; and often led to the establishment of two schools, where 
but one should exist. The law is rather too indefinite as to the du- 
ties and powers of Directors in sub-dividing. Some, consequently 
assume autocratic power, while others do nothing and allow patrons. 
to send pretty much where they please. A great desideratum is to- 
get the school and sub-school districts properly laid off. Could 
not our present law be somewhat improved on this point? 
Teachers’ Institutes. —For the assistance and better qualification of” 
teachers in their work, the necessity of some system of Teachers’ 
Institutes was, at once, apparent. After considering the question. 
' fully, I have adopted the district system ; and instead of holding a 
single Institute at the county capital, I meet the teachers at four’ 
“convenient points in the county, once each month. In this way, I 
think a better attendance can be secured, as the matter is brought 
nearer at home to all. These meetings have already been held with 
flattering prospects of success. At these meetings we discuss and 
explain the best methods of school instruction and discipline. It is. 
intended that they shall instruct the teachers, not so much in the 
subject matter of the various branches of study;.as “how to teach 
them.” Ata future time, I propose to hold a general Institute for 
the entire county. I am convinced that there is no more efficient 
instrument for advancing our educational interests than “Teachers” 
nstitutes.” Normal schools are excellent, but they are too slow,~ 
. and too far in the distance to meet the requirements of the present. 
The Finances.—The question of finance, as in most other things, 
is one of vital importance in considering the success of our school 
system. As my statistical report will show, the County Court very 
'
-P-A-G-E-85
’ 
  oe [85] 
generously supplemented the State levy, so that our schools will be 
able to run an average of five months or more. Collecting the 
taxes promptly, and getting the funds on hand in due time, will be 
the only trouble. The county tax book, which should have been 
furnished to the collector on the Ist of October, is not yet com- 
pleted. Consequently, I ami unable to determine the exact amount 
-of our school fund the present year. Whether it would not be bet- 
ter that provision be made for collecting the taxes a year‘in ad- 
vance, is a question. A remnant of the old county fund, still on 
hand, will prove a timely aid. A number of the schools have been 
running two or three months with this money. If" possible, eyery 
dollar of the teachers’ salary should be paid as soon as his work is 
‘done. Nothing tends more to maintain public confidence, and to 
give the schools popularity than promptness with the finances. 
School Attendance.—The per cent. of attendance, at the schools 
generally, fell off after the first month, as is usually the case with 
‘our public schools after the novelty wears down. Children are kept 
away from school by their parents on the slightest pretexts, and 
some of the most illiterate do not send at all. Cases occur of large 
families of children which are deriving no advantages whatever 
from the public school, or any other schools. I have conversed with 
many of the District Directors on the subject, and find them almost 
unanimously in favor of compulsory attendance. An amendment 
to the law, fining all parents who keep their children at home, ex- 
cept in cases of sickness, to the extent of tuition lost, it is believed 
would have a salutary effect. The very persons for whom the free 
schools are more especially intended, are oftenest the parties at fault. 
It is plain that if attendance is not secured, the very object of the 
law must be defeated. Asa general thing it is useless to talk of 
infusing a spirit of education into uneducated. people, so that they 
will sufficiently appreciate its advantages. To expect such an ap- 
preciation, is like expecting of asick man a pathological knowledge 
-of his disease, and ability for self-treatment. 
School Houses.—Knox county has several good school-houses, but 
‘she needs more. Without good school-houses and good furniture, 
schools of the best class cannot be taught. Many schools are now 
being taught in churches and other ill adapted places. In cases of 
necessity, I consider it advisable to shorten the sessions, and devote 
a portion of the public fund to assist in building and furnishing
-P-A-G-E-86
[86] 
houses. I expect, during the leisure: part of the school year, to- 
make special exertions 'to secure the building of good houses in des- 
titute districts. There is, almost everywhere, a sad deficiencv im 
the architecture of our school-houses. A good house is frequently 
spoilt for want of proper architectural design. A finished school-- 
house is, of itself, a potent educator. The need of a small pamphlet 
on school-house architecture, with plans of houses, costing from four 
hundred to seven hundred, or one thousand dollars, is much felt.. 
The most of the books extant strike too high, and too elaborately 
for common country schools. 
Want of Books.--Some schools labor under the disadvantage of” 
not having sufficient books. All the teachers’ efforts fail to induce 
certain parents to buy the books necessary. Before such schools. 
can prosper, some means must be devised to secure the proper books. 
to all the pupils. 
City Schools —The Knoxville schools operate under their own 
charter and regulations. A corporation tax is levied, additional to- 
the State and county fund, sufficient to run the schools ten months. 
in the year. The schools are carefully graded, and are proving a 
decided success, under the supervision of Mr. Alexander Baird,. 
City Superintendent. 
Peabody Aid.—Only one application has been made for assistance: 
from the “Peabody Fund,” as yet, outside of Knoxville. I hope- 
to have a larger number of schools in condition to meet the require- 
ments next year. 
Superintendent’s Salary.—My salary’ is paid from the current funds. 
of the county and the examination fees of the applicants to teach, 
' and. therefore, causes no diminution of the school fund. The ex~ 
amination fee is one dollar. - 
The Futwre—I can unhesitatingly say that the prospects for free, 
. universal education were never more flattering in Knox county. 
Such-an awakening has never been known before. ‘ New and better- 
school-houses have been built. Improved school furniture, in some 
cases, is being put in, and the progress in these respects has been. 
‘very encouraging. There isa general spirit of advancement. Bet~- 
ter churches are building and Sunday-schools are numerous. The 
standard system of musical notation is coming into extensive use, 
even in remote disrticts. Political differences in school matters, are 
ignored, and men of all parties and creeds come up boldly and ‘put.
-P-A-G-E-87
  [87] 
their shoulders to the wheel. — The old fellows who teach: Pike’s 
Arithmetic, and “loud” schools, have quietly dropped to the rear; ~ 
and teachers, with young blood in their veins, take their places. If | 
the good work only continues, all will be well.

As yet, there has not been much done in the way of schools. 
The schools that are organized, have not been patronized very well, . 
as most of the children have had to assist in picking out the cotton 
crop. We have great difficulty in getting competent teachers.” 
This, as you are aware, isa new county. The lands are owned 
by a few men, and most of them non-residents, So that we will. 
have to undergo a radical change before we can make any great ad- 
vance in schools. However, we have some good citizens, who are 
doing all they can for the free school system. :

the fullest expectations of the friends of the system.- As a warm 
friend of the system, I hope the coming Legislature will not mate- 
rially interfere with it.

difference in the public mind on the subject of free schools, which 
cannot, perhaps, be better illustrated than by a brief synopsis of the 
operations this year, under the existing law. The County Court, at 
_ the July term, refused to supplement the school tax, and leit it to.a 
vote of the people to levy, or not, an additional one’mill on the dol- 
lar for free school purposes, to be decided at the August election for 
District Directors. The Sheriff failed to hold the election, or give 
it any attention. I proceeded to appoint a Board of Directors in 
each district, and finally sticceeded in inducing the County Court to 
lay the matter again before the people, only to be defeated by a 
large majority of a very meager vote. The objection mostly urged 
is, what ignorance and prejudice call the injustice of educating the 
colored population at the expense of the whites. This feeling, how- 
ever, is giving way in the minds of most good people, and will soon 
exist only among the most selfish, and among those who pay neither 
taxes nor tuition. I feel sure that an election held even now, on 
the question of a school tax, would show a change of sentiment; and 
notwithstanding the paucity of results thus far, I am quite hopeful, 
from the indications, that another year will show much better fruits. 
Bat little has been done yet in building school-houses. The 
schools so far are taught, and perhaps will be mainly for sometime, 
in houses built heretofore by neighborhood enterprise. The major- 
ity of these are in tolerably good condition, and some of them are 
very good houses. I have endeavored, and shall continue to do so, 
to encourage the building of school-houses without resorting to the 
school fund. 
On the whole, I think there is much ground to be pleased with 
the law; and though it has, as I conceive, some defects, which time 
‘and experience will remedy ; yet, if the officers and people do their: 
duty under the law, it will soon go far to remove the stigma that 
has hitherto attached to the fair nume of Tennessee, on account of 
her‘backwardnegs in regard to public schools. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
I think the apathy that prevails here is owing to three causes: 
First, there is naturally too little spirit of educational enterprise ;
-P-A-G-E-90
[90] , 
‘secondly, we are just now ground to the earth with Railroad taxes 
in this county; thirdly, and mainly, the threatened passage of the 
“Civil Rights Bill” This, at first, created distrust and dread, and 
those begot an indifference that can only be overcome with great 
difficulty.

Ti will be impossible to sustain the Public School System in this 
county from the fact that the amount of taxable property in the - 
county is not sufficient to raise the necessary funds. It will require 
a tax of 70 cents on a hundred dollars worth of property, and the 
people will not submit to such heavy taxation for school purposes.

I would further report that upon visiting the schools of ‘this 
county, I found some most excellent schools, though some were in- 
ferior, but, as a general thing, much better than I expected. Owing 
to the late election of County Superintendent, and the refusal of 
old commissioners to act, we have had scarcely time to get the sys~ 
tem into operation. Some teachers of this county are not such as TE 
would like, but they were the best that could be secured. Some of 
the Directors of districts entirely destitute of school-houses have 
determined to use the public money for the purpose of building 
houses. Several schools will begin next month (November). A. 
‘Teachers’ Association was organized to-day. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874; 
In some localities the schools have done very well, in others they 
have not done so well. About the same interest is manifested in the 
. ‘schools this year-as last. There still exists a strong prejudice against 
public schools in this county.

tax held. 
The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
I came into the office of Superintendent of Public Schools for 
the county of Madison in July last. I found great prejudice in the 
minds of the people against the system of free schools. This, I 
think, is owing to the want of a proper understanding of the prin- 
ciples of the law. There having been no system of free schools in 
this county for some years, we had no school commissoners, and, 
consequently, could do nothing until after the election in August. 
Immediately after the election, I proceeded to organize the several 
District Boards, and take the scholastic population of each district. 
Three-fourths of the districts have very indifferent school-houses. 
Many of them have none at all, and the Directors are powerless to . 
remedy the want. This county at present is opposed to taxation, 
even to build school-houses in their own districts. Some wish to 
use the school funds for this purpose. I do not think they have a 
right to do so. 
Our farmers are compelled to have the assistance of their chil- 
dren both in cultivating and gathering their crops; consequently 
we could not keep up a school in mést of the districts more than 
five months in the year. Hence we have been able thus far to es- 
tablish but few schools. 
The Directors of the 15th district have made arrangements with 
the teachers of the college at Jackson to unite the public school 
with that institution. This arrangement is a good one, as it saves 
rent. They have engaged the services of two excellent teachers. 
A school for girls has been opened, and an experienced and accom- 
plished lady engaged as principal. A schoo! for colored children 
has been established at Jackson. A school to each district has been 
established in the 5th, 10th, 12th, and 13th districts. They were 
organized between. the Ist and 15th of October. We qannot
-P-A-G-E-96
[96] 
establish schools in many of the districts before November 15th 
or December 1st, as school-houses will, in many instances, have to 
be built. Our civil districts (which are also school districts) are so 
large and irregular in shape that it is impossible to locate school— 
houses so as to give general satisfaction. I am satisfied that unless 
the State establish some system of public instruction, our people 
must grow up in ignorance. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
There has, during the year, been an increased educational activity 
in the county. The free school system under the present law was 
working well, until the action taken by the Senate of the United 
States on the “Civil Rights Bill.” 
Arrangements were made by the Directors with the trustees of 
the college at Jackson, and the High-schools at Pinson, Spring 
Creek, and, Henderson Station to teach all the branches required by 
law free of charge. This worked well, and gave general satisfac— 
tion. There have been five school-houses built during the year. 
The citizens are becoming more interested on this subject, being 
satisfied that without some system of public schools, two-thirds of 
the rising generation must be brought up uneducated. 
_ Lregret to inform you that, on yesterday, our County Court re— 
pealed the law of last January, levying a county tax for school pur- 
poses. There will be no fund for this county, except that derived 
from the State. I believe a large majority of the citizens are in 
favor of the school tax.

[97] 
its January Term refused to levy the tax for school purposes, but © 
referred it to the people, who voted upon thé proposition on the. ° 
_ %th day of March last, and voted for the tax almost tmanimousty— 
- thus rebuking the County Court. 
The County Superintendent writes under date of December 14, 
1874: _ 
In August and September I visited every district in my county 
and almost every school, and, in my humble manner, tried to im- 
press the clerks with the importance of having their reports ready 
in time. Some of them have done so, while others have, as yet, 
failed to do so. I could make you a partial report, but, thinking it 
would not be satisfactory, have not done so. Our schools have 
done well, everything considered. I very much regret that I am 
unable to make the report as required of me by law. If you could 
extend the time of making your report a few days, I would visit 
the delinquent clerks, and try to get it up’yet.

The County Superintendent. reported, October, 1873: 
For three years previous to the inauguration of the new school 
system, we had no schools in McMinn county, except in those loca- 
tions where the people saw proper to have subscription schools. 
During the time mentioned, the people of McMinn county were 
called upon to vote “school tax” or “no school tax.” The majority 
voting against school tax, there were, therefore, no free’ schools. 
Since the passage of the new school law, and my appointment to the 
office of County Superintendent, the people have taken considerable 
interest in the education of their children; while it is true that 
there are many parents who do not feel interested as they should. 
On the 7th of August, in every district but one,. Directors were 
elected, who proceeded, at once, to take the census and. organize 
schools in their respective districts—showing that they were alive 
to their work. They are willing, and perform the duties of their, 
office with efficiency. \

We have in McMinn county, quite a number of very excellent 
teachers ; and, in visiting the schools, I have been much gratified 
to find that the most of the teachers were taking special pains in 
teaching the elementary branches, the importance of which I have 
impressed upon the mind of every teacher. Strict attention has 
been given to a thorough teaching of orthography. Most of our 
schools will have to close soon for want of funds, while a few will 
continue for some time yet. We have organized a “ Teachers’ As—

The County Superintendent feported, October, 1873: 
Since the close of schools in 1869, and the repeal of the State. 
system, we have had no public schools. Private schools were suc- 
cessfully carried on in some neighborhoods, but the indigent and 
needy were entirely deprived of the advantages of common schools. 
The County Court refused to levy a tax, or take any measures 
whatever, to establish a county system; consequently the cause of” 
education suffered greatly. 
‘A great many of our public school- houses ° were destroyed during 
the war; and what few remained, have since been neglected, and 
are now wholly unfit for comfort and accommodation. 
The failure of the State authorities to comply with their obliga~ 
tions in the compensation of teachers, destroyed, ina great measure, 
the confidence of the people in a common school system. This, 
I believe, is a brief. statement of the condition in which our pres- 
ent law found us. 
In this, the commencement of our present system, the prospects, 
I may say, are flattering. We have been fortunate in securing a 
better grade of teachers than we anticipated. They are, with some 
few-exceptions, working, efficient men, and have gone to work with 
a spirit, and an energy never before manifested, and with a laudable 
ambition to impart instruction to their pupils, build up our schools, 
and render them useful and beneficial to the youths of our noble 
old State. 
_ The district Directors are working with an energy and zeal-which _ 
promise, I fondly hope, at no distant day, to demonstrate the effi- 
ciency of well organized free schools. 
"The most serious difficulty in our way is a want of uniformity in 
text books. After consulting with many of the Directors, I con- 
cluded not to recommend any particular class of text-beoks for .
-P-A-G-E-103

[103] 
the present year, but for the next scholastic year I will do so, if . 
practicable. However, I am persuaded that this difficulty will | 
more or less disappear every year, as our schools progress, and uni- 
formity shall be measurably attained ; perhaps sooner, and more to 
the satisfaction of all, than if by adoption at once. 
We think our funds will be sufficient to keep up our schools for 
five months. Our Trustee has on hand the school tax on polls, 
since the adoption of the new constitution ; also about $2,500, 
drawn from the State Bank, as ‘unpaid balances on the sale of 
“School Lands” in our county. And with what we will realize 
from taxes for the present year, we will have something over $8,- 
000.00. 
T am pleased with the promising and encouraging start, and if 
we can only keep alive the energy and interest of our citizens, in a 
few'years, we will not be taunted with a want of spirit in the cause 
of education.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
I have deemed it best, and am sustained by public sentiment in 
‘the action, to delay starting the schools in this county, until funds 
sufficient to support them, have accumulated. This, I have thought — 
could do no harm to the system, or to the educational interests of 
the county. And it is evidently the wisest course to be pursued, 
under the existing status of educational matters here, since we have 
the prejudices of past failures to encounter. - 
The county is well supplied with school-houses, some of them © 
comfortable, others needing repairs. The Directors~are at work, 
looking io the comfort of the schools when started. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The success of the school system is due, thus far, mainly to the 
diligence of the officers and the faithfulness of the teachers. Teach- 
ers have made rapid advancement in the art of teaching, and not- 
withstanding the fund is but little more than one-half what it should 
be to meet the requirements of the law, yet the system is rapidly 
winning superiority over the pay school system,

in Moore county. Moore is a new county, only organized in June,

- The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
Up to the inauguration of the present system, there was a lament- 
able apathy upon the subject of education in this county, with the
-P-A-G-E-107
[ 107 ] 
exception of one or two localities only. There is still considerable ., 
- prejudice in regard to the free school system, in the minds of some 
of our citizeus. This, however, is gradually giving way, as the new 
administration is developing itself. In the country districts we have 
been forced to suspend a number of the schools until the cotton 
crop is gathered. This cansed my special report to be much more 
meager than I like. All this, however, will be remedied in about 
four weeks. I find it quite difficult.to get the Directors to take as 
much interest as they should, from the fact that they get no pay for 
their services, aside from the consciousness, of discharge of duty. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
Considering the opposition that has existed in our county, not 
only among the enemies of a free school system im our county, but 
also among those who are acting as public servants in carrying out 
the system, and who should have labored zealously to destroy that 
opposition, instead of fostering and encouraging it; the system has’. 
‘been a most brilliant and gratifying suecess. When fully under- 
stood by the masses, it will receive almost unanimous support and 
endorsement at the ballot-box. I apprehend trouble, -however, 
from our County Court, as I do not now think they will levy any 
tax for school purposes for 1875.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
T found in July, on entering upon the discharge of the duties of 
my office, twelve private schools in operation, with an average en- 
rollment of about twenty-five pupils—neatly all strictly primary. 
Owing to our financial condition, we found some difficulty in pro- 
curing teachers, and organizing schools. Yet we have organized, 
_and are progressing tolerably well. We have* 23 public schools, ° 
with an average enrollment of 45 pupils, and 5 private schools, with 
an average enrollment of about 30. pupils, so that we have, in all, 
about 1,180 pupils enrglled in school. . 
I think the people are well pleased with the public school system, 
as a whole, yet would be’ pleased to see some slight changes in the 
one mill tax, and in the mode of. apportioning the same. If two 
mills were levied instead of one, and collected and apportioned in 
_ the same manner as the poll tax, it would meet the approval of this 
people. In some districts I find the people enthusiastic on the sub- 
ject of education, while in others, they are slow to appreciate the 
necessity of educating. Yet, as a whole, the people of this county 
are becoming alive to the interests of their children, and are begin- 
ning to repair old school-houses, and to build new ones in districts. 
which have none. I find the school-houses, as a general thing, 
leaky log cabins, with stick and dirt chimneys, and indifferently fur- - 
nished—in fact, I find none well-furnished. But few have “glass 
windows; so that they are either too dark or too open in winter. . 
We have no colored schools organized as yet. The colored peo- 
ple requested that the opening of their schools be postponed until 
  
' *Reported by former Superintendent. a
-P-A-G-E-110
[110] : 
they could gather their crops of cotton and peanuts. Owing to the 
thinness of the colored population, we will not have more than two 
or three colored schools at most. 
The County Court of this county failed to levy any school tax, 
and did not order an election for that purpose, therefore our schoo 
' fund is comparatively small. We have near $3,000.00, old fund, in 
the county treasury. : 
The Coupty Court appointed Commissioners, who have laid off 
the county into 40 school districts, ignoring civil district lines. The 
people met in most of these districts, on the first Thursday in Au- 
gust last, and elected their school Directors. Some districts failed 
_ to elect, and thereupon I appointed and commissioned Directors in 
all those that failed. 
We have in our county two tolerably good academic school- 
houses, but no academic. school in opération. We have an aca- 
demic fund of from six to eight thousand dollars,

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
“When I set out in August, and began the organizations, I found 
too much to do in the short time allowed. I found only a few 
schools in the county that could move on in the work. They were 
generally divided up under that most destructive law, allowing the 
funds to be appropriated whenever they could collect twelve, twenty, 
or forty pupils, under the plea of being remotely situated. With 
the help of the. present law, I soon got the people to understand 
that they could have no schools unless they changed their policy. 
With the aid of the new Directors, we now have schools in opera- 
tion, and teachers employed for five months, within the reach of all 
the children of the county, with the exception of one school which 
cannot be started for want of a house. School-houses are the great: 
drawbacks with us. ‘The houses used are generally old and uncom- 
fortable. Many are old churches temporarily arranged for the 
present purpose. We can safely say our schools are greatly im- 
proved compared with the former ones; but as our work is only for 
the present, we can but hope for the future. . 
_ In order to secure permanency in our schools, our county will 
have to be redistricted in order that the houses may be properly lo- 
cated. Our Court has already appointed commissioners for that. 
purpose, and as soon as that is done, and the organization completed, _ 
I will try and have the charters obtained as required by your in- 
structions of July 21. I found it \inexpedient to undertake it in — 
the present confused state of the school districts. There are many 
obstacles in the way of accomplishing the much-desired object, and 
none greater than the incompetency and ignorance of Directors. 
We hope to overcome a great portion of this by mildness and per- 
severance in the good cause, especially if we have a little more. leg- 
islative aid.
-P-A-G-E-112

I find from the reports up to this time that although the great 
“mass of the pupils were enrolled in the schools, yet there are not 
more than forty per cent in attendance.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
The condition of schools in this county before the present system 
was as bad as could be in a civilized community, or nearly so. But 
under the present system the school interest is becoming greatly re- 
vived. Sensible, thinking men and men of influence in this county 
are finely pleased with the present school system, but think some 
little changes might be made to advantage. 
The school districts of this county are in bad shape, but a ma- 
jority of the County Court have promised me that they will ap- 
point three commissioners to lay off the county into regular school 
districts, so as to have one school in each. They seem fully aroused

on the subject of free schools, and, I think, they will levy a tax suf- 
ficient to carry on a five-months’ school next year in each district. 
I will ‘call a meeting of the Directors of this ecunty soon for the 
" purpose of organizing a Teachers’ Institute, to adopt a uniform

The educational advantages of this county are limited, and- have 
been so, for some time, particularly in the way of school-houses. I 
think the school system we have now will work satisfactorily, when 
once we can get the people to have confidence in school matters, es- 
pecially in a financial view.

the Directors reporting such a number for the county. By earnest

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
In Rutherford county, about the time of the passage of the pres- 
ent public school law, there was a very decided opposition mani- 
fested on the part of many of the large tax payers. Under the suc- 
cessful operation of the law, opposition has almost entirely been 
overcome, and many of the former enemies of the law are now its. 
most stanch defenders. At present, there is but one sentiment, and 
that is decidedly in favor of the law. 
I have not sought to influence the people of the districts of my 
county to levy a special tax for school purposes, thinking it better 
to let them see the good results of the present law, before the ques- 
tion of additional taxation should be presented to them. 
For the past two months, I have been holding teachers’ meetings 
- every Saturday, which have been well attended by teachers, Direc- 
  
*Appointed by State Superintendent—in place of G. W. Jarman, who resigned 
October, 1874—to make the annual report for the county.

tors and citizens ; and Tam satisfied they will result in great. good. ' 
At the meetings or Institutes, I have endeavored to present to the 
teachers my views as to the best methods of teaching the several 
branches prescribed in the school Ww, and to arouse them to a sense 
of the magnitude and importance of the work in which they are en- 
gaged. Many of our teachers are young and inexperienced, while 
others are rather farmers than teachers, and in my opinion, they 
need the aid of this improvised Normal School. I have been much 
gratified. at the result. ‘

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
In regard to the present system of schools, I think itis by far: 
the best that has ever been organized in our county. We have a 
school in every district in the county, notwithstanding two-thirds of” 
our territory is situated on the mountains, and is very thinly peo- 
pled, making it impossible to arrange districts with -sufficient 
strength, convenient to all parties interested. The schools have all 
been organized to run five months, but owing to a want of funds, . 
they will be compelled to stop sooner. The County Court has not 
levied sufficient tax to run the schools for five months. Hence I 
have advised them to continue as long as their means will permit 
them, and then to close for the present. 
Tam of opinion that our County Court, at its next January Term, 
will fully understand thé law, and levy a tax sufficient to run the- 
schools for five months in the year.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
The schools in this county are doing very well. We account for 
the small number enrolled by its being late in the season when our 
schools opened, which was owing to a want of competent teachers in 
the county. I have done the best possible under the circumstances, 
being compelled to issue several certificates that graded under five. 
The people are becoming alive on the subject of education. All 
speak well of the “New School Law.” They say the law should 
compel the schools to hold five months. os 
The schools of the county are nearly all in operation. We had 
the county system in operation here, prior to the passage of the late 
act, though it was not working well. 
The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
I have visited nearly all my schools this fall, and find that they 
are running very satisfactorily. Education in Sevier is looking up, 
and brighter days are dawning.

pone opening. the schools to accommodate the cotton-picking in-

have reported to you. Several new school-houses are being built. 
The opposition to the public schools is weakening with the whites, 
-while they are popular with the colored people, and are gaining 
ground in that respect. 
Some of the schools of the county, outside of the city, as well as 
within the corporation, are quite large, and have one or more assist- 
ant teachers, with 100 or more scholars. - .

was not even drawn out by the Commissioners under the old law, so 
little was the public interest valued, and some $12,000.00 remained 
in the county treasury from the old fund, which we can use- profit- 
ably this year. , 
The 5th, 14th arid 15th civil districts, (now incorporated as town- 
ships,) in which the city lies, would readily vote a tax on themselves 
if separated from the city, which it is feared, would be hostile to 
such a movement. The severance of those outside of the city, by 
Act of the Legislature, would be acceptable to them. 
My Directors are mostlytnew men in this business, but will, I

The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
\ There has always been great arftipathy to public schools in this 
* county, and the greatest opposition is from those who have no other 
way to educate their children than by public assistance. Last year 
- —that isin the fall of 1873—we had very successful schools, but 
owing to the fact that we had but. little money on hand at the time 
the teachers’ salaries were due, there was much trouble occasioned. 
Our teachers have all been paid off now; and we havea small 
amount on hand yet. - 
. The pendency of the “ Civil Rights Bill ” was the chief cause of 
_ the failure of our schools this year. The prospect will be gloomy 
until that difficulty is out of the way. ‘

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873 : 
There are 39 schools organized in this county, and some of them 
are ina prosperous condition. But twenty of the district clerks 
have reported yet—a circumstance which I regret. I'am convinced 
that we have too many school officers in this county. It is impos-° 
sible to get them all to go forward in the discharge of their duties. 
Some districts are. backward about employing teachers, + fearing 
there will not be money enough to pay them for five months’ ser- 
vices. I fear we are paying teachers too much in this county, and 
have tried to get the District Directors to see it in that light. 
We lack school-houses in some districts, and are not able to build; 
and as to levying a tax for that purpose, it would be voted down. I 
take pleasure in stating that, in some districts, they are repairing 
and building by individual effort, and I hope soon to see comforta- - 
ble houses in most of the districts.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
The Free Schools of Sumner county have been organized under 
many difficulties. Prior to the passage of the present law, free 
schools were not popular in many parts of the county. None had 
existed since the resignation of Sup’t McQuiddy, which were or- 
ganized upon a legal basis. I found every thing in disorder, and 
was obliged to start de novo. Upon the passage of the present law, 
much opposition developed -itself-in some parts of the county; es- 
pecially directed against those features of the law looking to the 
education of colored children. Under the beneficent action of the - 
system, this opposition, once so blatant and aggressive, has almost 
entirely died away ; and nearly all good citizens now commend and 
support the law. 
. The county has been lately re-districted, and many neighborhoods 
have been thereby cut out from the houses which their children had 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
. [125 ] 
for years attended. Some districts have been left without -any 
school-houses, and are using churches and rented buildings. There 
are in the county but few houses suitably constructed and furnished 
for effective teaching ; but this is only a temporary inconvenience. 
The people are aroused, and I hope soon to report the erection of.a 
sufficient number of comfortable houses, so furnished as to be an 
honor to the county, and to enable the teachers to obtain the-greatest 
results from their labors. Now, in too many instances, both teachers 
and pupils are incommoded and uncomfortable; and comparatively 
little is effected towards educating the larger part of the children. 
The principal hindrance to greater success is the want of funds. 
No additional tax was levied by the County Court, nor was the 
question of taxation submitted to the people. The “back school 
fund,” which was adjudged sufficient to eke out the meager fund 
assessed under the present Jaw, was found, upon investigation, to be 
of no value. It had all disappeared; applied, to use the mildest 
terms, in a very irregular and careless manner, and nothing could 
be made available from it to increase our insufficient means. In 
this emergency the County Court voted to add this year’s county 
- poll tax to the school fund. This addition may furnish enough 
money to carry on our schools from eight to twelve weeks. : 
A large part of the schools opened in September. Many children 
were delayed, by labor on the farms, from then entering. Now, by 
the premature closing of the schools, such unfortunates are debarred 
for another year from educational privileges. 
This year’s experience has taught the friends of free schools the 
“importance of energy and promptness. Another year will see the 
schools of Sumner continued for at least five months, and her funds 
sufficient to educate her entire scholastic population. 
Though the district schools have been obliged, in many instances, 
to thus prematurely close their doors, we have several most excellent 
eonsolidated schools which are doing noble work for the cause. 
“Sumner High School,” under charge of Prof. Chas. 8. Douglass ; 
“Beech Hill Academy,” under charge of Rev. M. R. Elliott, in the 
western part of the county; and the schools of Prof. Griffin, and 
Miss P. A. Malone, in the eastern, are notable examples of what can 
be accomplished by competent teachers in comfortable houses, in 
bestowing the blessings of education upon the so long neglected 
children of the county.
-P-A-G-E-126
[126 ] . 
In the twenty-second District, embracing the town of Gallatin, a 
High.School has been organized, employing six teachers, and hav- 
ing nearly three hundred pupils upon its rolls. We hope to make 
it the model school of the county. . 
The difficulties I have encountered in my work, do not discourage 
me. My teachers, though in many instances inexperienced, are 
faithful and energetic. The District Directors are, generally, capa- 
ble and willing. The Magistrates promise ample funds for the 
future. By earnest application and untiring energy, I am deter- 
tained, by God’s assistance, to place Sumner in the front rank of 
Free School counties. Success to the Free Schools! 
‘The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
The county schools are opening rapidly, and with very flattering 
prospects. The class of teachers is of higher qualification. The 
general outlook is very flattering throughout the entire county.

The County Superintendent reported, October, 1873: 
Our schools commenced under favorable circumstances, and give 
every indication of being under a good system. As to the effi- 
ciency of the law, I think it is the best that Tennessee has ever had. 
It meets the demands of the people, and is calculated to elevate the 
standard of scholarship, under the proper management. Our schools 
‘previous to the present system were little better than none.’ But 
. notwithstanding all the law can do, it cannot compel the parents to 
send to school. As the weather gets cold, the schools begin to di-
-P-A-G-E-129
  . [129] 
minish; and this goes on, until schools that were prosperous are 
nearly broken up, for want of attendance. Of course this is to be 
attributed to the parents, and is no fault of the law. 
Schools are now closing for want of means. After summing up 
all the money due my county, I find the amount due each pupil to 
be about $1.40, which instead of carrying on a five months’ school 
in each district, makes an average of three months. The County 
Court did not, levy a sufficient tax. The people are averse to it. 
Therefore, the schools must stop. Now, after considering the pres- 
ent school system, we say it is a good one, but proves ineffectual for . 
want of. means. All, or nearly all our free school teachers need 
their money.at the close of the session, which would be about the 
first of January, each year, as the first of August is the average time 
for commencing in this county. By some means, the funds are six 
or eight months too late to meet the demands. Hence, well edu- 
cated men will not teach, for there is no money in it. We there- 
fore must arrive at this conclusion: That law or system which will 
give the most money in due time, will prove the most efficient.

Before the present system of free schools went into operation,

advantage of about twu terms of schools, in nearly every district,

[131] 
The County Superintendent ‘reported, October, 1873 : 
Warren’ County, under the law of 1870, levied a tax of 20 cents 
on the ‘hundred dollars for the support of her free schools, and 
elected a Superintendent, but very soon thereafter abolished that 
office; and organized schools in about two-thirds of the districts. 
The schools were opened for about two and a half months in the 
year. As a consequence, the results of the effort were by no means 
satisfactory, and free schools were very unpopular with the majority 
of the people at the introduction of the new system. But a healthy 
reaction has taken place; and if our schools can be kept open five 
mouths. this year, I think the present system will be a decided suc- 
cess with our people, and will become correspondingly popular.

The County Superintendent reports, October, 1874: 
During the year, eighty-five applicants were examined ; of these, 
eighty obtained certificates. The examinations were both oral and 
written, but mostly oral, and for the most part in private. It is to 
be regretted that circumstances are such as to make it necessary to 
hold any private examinations. Twenty-four first grade certificates 
were granted last year, but the number, this year, will be much 
_ greater. The examinations are all written this year. The papers 
of each applicant are on file in the County Superintendent’s office. 
T visited all the schools, except two or three. These closed be-— 
fore I could reach them. I usually spent half a day in each school. 
I visited most of them twice; once near the beginning, .and again 
near the close of the session. Sometimes I taught for the teacher, 
and thus introduced my method in a quiet way. At other times I 
delivered a short lecture before the school. I made, in all, fifty 
lectures during the year. I have the satisfaction of knowing that 
‘much good grew out of my visitations. I found the teachers civil 
and polite, and the people hospitable, to a fault. I attended two. 
County Superintendents’ Conventions ; one at Nashville ;, also one 
at Knoxville. I have traveled over four thousand miles in the 
discharge of my official duties, and have written two hundred offi- 
cial letters. Besides, I found time to edit an educational column in 
the “Herald and Tribune.” TI have also written a number of arti- 
cles on educational subjects for other publications, including several 
school journals. 
I held six District Institutes, which were attended by sixty teach- 
ers, and quite a number of the Directors. These Institutes were 
held atthe best schools in the locality. A part of the time was 
spent in witnessing the operations of the school,and a part in drill- 
“ing the teachers. Many of our teachers had never seen a good 
school, and consequently had but little knowledge of school man- 
agement. The plan adopted worked well, and ‘prepared the teach~ 
_ers for the County Institute. . ~ ’ 
There are three papers published in the county: The “Herald 
. and Tribune,” the “ East Tennessee Echo,” and the “Johnson .City 
Times’? These papers are all favorable to public schools, and have
-P-A-G-E-133
183 J . 
always inserted my notices free of charge. I feel that they have 
been of great service to me in helping t to build up the schvol inter- 
est of the county. 
I find that teachers who read school-journals, and inform them- 
selves upon the improved methods of teaching, are better instruct- 
ors, and succeed better in the management of their schools. Fifty 
copies of the “Tennessee School Journal” are taken and read in the 
county. Several others—amounting in all, to fifty—are in the. 
hands of our teachers and Directors. In visiting schools, I en-~ 
deavor to introduce our journal. . 
There are ten graded schools in the county, employing twenty- | 
jtwo teachers. Two of these have been recently organized. For 
want of properly arranged houses; the grading has not been as per- 
fect as we would desire to see it. However, these schools have been 
instrumental in doing much good. They serve as models, and offer 
increased facilities for the education of the people. The question 
may be asked: Can a system of graded schools be adapted to the 
wants of rural districts? We think it can, by adopting something 
like the following : 
1. School districts may be so enlarged as to embrace pupils 
enough for a graded school of two or more departments. 
2. Two or more districts, with a primary school in each, may be 
united, and a central school formed for the more advanced pupils. 
3. A central high school may be established in each district, to ~ 
which the more advanced pupils should be sent. The practicability 
of such a plan is apparent to all who have ‘given the subject suffi- 
cient thought, and its economy cannot be questioned. Such a course 
is necessary, in my judgment, to vitalize the school interest. We 
have too many stall and inefficient schools. Incompetent teachers, 
are always on the lookout for such schools. 
Nothing, perhaps, has done so much in building up the educa- 
tional interests of the county as Teachers’ Institutes. On the 22d, 
23d and 24th of December, 1873, an Institute was held in Jones- 
boro. Sixty teachers attended. The exercises were interesting and 
profitable. Rev. W. B. Rankin, of Greeneville, delivered an able 
address on “Primary Education.” Prof. 8, Z. Sharp, of Maryville, 
taught and lectured before the Institute, with marked success, To 
both of these distinguished gentlemen, we are indebted for valuable 
assistance. s
-P-A-G-E-134
. [134] , 
From false diffidence, teachers are often deterred from active par- 
ticipation in the exercises. To avoid this difficulty, we have endeav- 
ored to employ home talent.” Teachers, like pupils, cannot be greatly 
benefitted by instruction measured out to them, while they them- 
selves are compelled to sit idly by, as mere passive recipients. They 
must fee] interested, and we know of no- better way of accomplish- 
ing this, than by making them a part of the machinery. -The last. 
County Institute was held at Limestone, August 17th, 18th, 19th, 
20th and- 21st, in connection with the State Institute. It was a 
grand meeting of teachers; such as we never had before. To Prof. 
M. C. Butler, of Knoxville; Prof. E. O. Tade, of “ Tusculum 
College ;” Prof. Sharp, of Maryville, and Rev. W. B. Rankin, of 
Greeneville, our teachers are under many and lasting obligations. 
Under the head of school-houses much might be said, for we still 
have many schpol-houses unfit to be occupied. A good house is just. 
as necessary to the success of a sehool as a competent teacher, but it 
is exceedingly difficult to make some districts believe such a thing. 
There are men, who are worth thousands of dollars, who argue that 
‘“anything will do to keep school in.” How hard it is to get such 
men out of the ruts! 
However, we have reason to be encouraged, for during. the last 
two years a number of good school-houses have been erected. 
There is a decided improvement in public sentiment. If parents. 
want their children to become willing scholars, let the school-house 
be made an attractive home for them, and the school-grounds a place 
of beauty. 
Two new houses ‘will soon be ready for occupancy. They wilk 
have hat and cloak rooms, and will be furnished with patent desks, 
blackboards, wall-maps, ete. Our Directors are becoming interested, 
and the people are demanding better houses. The old “slab seat ” 
has not entirely disappeared, but most of the school-houses have 
something better, and some of them have excellent desks. Two- 
years have made a wonderful change i in seating, as well as in build~ 
ing, school-houses. May the good work ever go on. 
Though our progress in educational affairs has not, during the 
year, in every particular, been all we could desire, we can make a 
favorable report. In séveral respects we have made improvements, 
- but in nothing more than in ‘the building of school-houses. During 
the year, eight houses were erected. Of these, the one at Limestone
-P-A-G-E-135
[195] - , 
is a first-class house—a large two-story building, finished and fur- 
nished in good style. The new houses of the county are all im- 
provements on the prevailing style of sehool-house architecture. 
The standard of teaching has been so elevated that many who 
have heretofore taught in the public schools are unable to obtain 
teachers’ certificates. 
There is a better understanding of the school law among both 
Directors and people. Public schools are better understood and 
better appreciated. The examinations of the schools last year were 
attended by the people in large numbers. Everybody seemed in- 
terested in the success of the schools. 
In almost’ every district, we have uniformity of text-books. It 
is difficult to convince the patrons of the necessity of uniformity. 
The county has adopted a good series. 
Through the kindness of the County Court, I have been fur- 
nished a comfortable office in the court-house. 
“Bonn’s Teachers’ Library” is now in the County Superintend- 
ent’s office, to which the teachers of the county have free access. 
Public sentiment, in the main, is in our favor, still we have some 
croakers, who cry aloud, and spare not. Every blunder or mistake 
that is made in the execution of the law is laid upon the system it- 
self by those fault-finders. Their number is rapidly growing less, 
and their influence is no longer to be feared. 
Our greatest want is a sufficient number of well-qualified teachers, 
and this want cannot be supplied until school terms are lengthened, 
and the salaries of competent teachers raised. First. We need more 
help from the State. Second. Longer school terms. Third. Higher 
salaries for teachers. Fourth. A good educational journal in the 
hands of teacher, Director, and parent. Fifth. District supervision. 
Sixth. Less frequent change of teachers. Seventh. A greater in- 
terest manifested by Directors and parents. Eighth. Conveniently-lo- 
cated, properly-arranged, and well-furnished country school-houses. " 
I have concluded to venture a few suggestions looking to the i im- 
provement of the present school law: 
(1.) The State does not furnish a sufficient amount of money. In 
addition to the present tax, the State should levy another mill on 
the dollar pf taxable property. This would encourage the counties, 
and induce them to levy an additional school tax. : 
@) The County Courts should not be vested with the power of
-P-A-G-E-136
  * [136] 
electing County Superintendents. I regard this as one of the weak- 
est features of the present law. The State Superintendent should 
appoint, or a “ County Board of Education” might elect this officer. 
Some prefer that he be elected by the people. On this point I have 
some doubts. 
(8.) The law should provide for the holding of county Institutes, 
the expense of which to be paid by the State. It should be made 
one of the duties of County Superintendents to hold “ Teachers’ In- 
stitutes.” 
(4.) Normal schools should be provided for by the law. 
(5.) The law is indefinite on the subject of text-books. The 
counties should be required to.adopt a uniform series of text-books 
for the public schools.

There are 3,234 children in this county between the ages of 6 and 
18. I think, from what information I can get, about one-half of 
that number was entirely illiterate, at the beginning of the present 
term. 
The public schools have succeeded well, considering the surround- 
ing circumstances, the time they commenced, the condition of school- 
houses, ete., and considering also, that public opinion in this county 
was against public schools. This latter, however, I am happy to 
say, has changed to a great extent. 
It was necessary to discontinue the schools of this county at the 
. end of*four months, for various reasons. We hope that much good 
has been done the present term. : ’

pearing in the city, in March, it was deemed wise to suspend the 
schools for a time to avoid contagion, and to carry out the ordinance 
of vaccination. This, with other just causes, prevented the schools 
from running the full time. coy 
The school system, though only two years old, is thoroughly or- 
-ganized, with an efficient School Board of ten members, five of 
whom are chosen annually for two years. 
A course of study has been selected and put in operation, for the 
Primary and Grammar Departments, consisting of eight grades, 
modeled after the most approved methods, and has been attended 
with highly gratifying results. 
Faithful labors, enthusiasm for the success of the schools, and a 
constantly growing interest in their welfare, displayed by the citi- 
zens, have all conspired to a rapid development in the right diree- 
tion, placing them on a firm basis, and giving them a rank not in-

The City Superintendent reports, December, 1874: | . 
The public schools of this city have been in operation for three 
years, and have, I think, more than met the expectations of the cit- 
izens; although, in the beginning, we labored under many disad- 
vantages, from want of experienced teachers, and suitable buildings 
for grading. That'we are progressing slowly, but surely, is evident 
from the fact that a new building, now nearly completed, is being 
erected at an estimated cost of $6,000. We needa central High 
School, and I am gratified to report that it is in contemplation. 
So we may hope in a few years to have schools, and school build- 
ings that will compare favorably with those of other cities of the 
same wealth and population. 
Night schools have been established for the benefit ‘of those who 
cannot attend day schools. This enterprise is well deserving of 
notice, and quite a number of our young men who would otherwise 
be unable to obtain even an elementary education, are availing 
themselves of the opportunity. I am not aware of any complaints 
against the public schools of this city. The only objection seems to 
be that they were not inaugurated sooner.

  INSTRUCTIONS AND Forms. 
CIRCULAR LETTER. 
Strate SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, 
NasHVILLE, JuNE, 1873. 
_ To the Chairmen and Members of the Cownty Courts of Tennessee : 
As State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Tennessee, I 
have no control whatever over the action of the County Courts, nor 
does the law make it my duty to offer suggestions to the Courts con- 
cerning their duty.under it. It is my duty, however, implied by 
the very nature of | my office, to make all reasonable effort to pro- 
mote the success of the Public School System whose organization 
and operations I have been appointed to superintend. I trust, there- 
fore, I will be pardoned for calling your attention to certain provi- 
sions of the School Law whose execution will require action on 
your part, and will be essential to the establishment and mainte- 
nance of the Schools. 
ELECTION OF A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT, 
To such of the Courts as did not elect County Superintendents at 
the last April term, Section 8 of the School Law is respectfully pre- 
sented for consideration and action thereunder, at the July term: 
That section is as follows: 
Sec. 8. Be it further enacted, There shall bea County Superin- 
tendent for each county, who shall be elected by the County Court.
-P-A-G-E-176
{176] 
at its April or July term, 1878, and after 1874 he shall be elected 
biennially in January, and no member of the County Court shall be 
eligible to said office. He shall be a person of literary and scien- 
tific attainments, and, when practicable, of skill and experience in 
the art of teaching; shall hold his office fur two years, and shall re- 
ceive such pay for his services as may be allowed him by the County 
Court, to be paid upon the order of the Chairman or Judge of the 
County Court by the County Trustee. He shall be subject to re- 
moval from office for misbehavior or inefficiency at any time, by the 
County Court; Provided, that the causes for such removal shall be 
‘ communicated to him in writing. 
The postponement of the election of Superintendents till July, by 
a majority of the counties in the State has resulted in no special em- 
barrassment. On the contrary, if the Magistrates have availed 
themselves of the delay to better acquaint themselves with the na- 
ture of the duties to be performed by the Superintendents, and have, 
in consequence, become duly impressed with the importance of se- 
lecting only thoroughly competent and efficient men for the positions, 
much good will have resulted from the postponement. These elec- 
tions, however, cannot be longer postponed. They must be made at 
the July term. 
The necessary qualifications of a County-Superintendent are in- 
dicated by the law, and it is not the province of the State Superin- 
tendent to give interpretation to its language. Each magistrate will, 
of course, determine the question of qualification for himself, and 
there is no specifie standard by which his judgment shall be guided. 
Yet I trust I will be excused for suggesting that the election of an 
incompetent Superintendent will virtually defeat all school opera- 
tions in the county for which he may be chosen. Upon the activity 
and capacity of the County Superintendent, mainly depends the sue- 
cess of the schools in his county. Too much care cannot be exer- 
~ eised, therefore, in his selection. 
THE LEVY OF AN ADDITIONAL TAX. 
The special attention of such Courts, as have not already taken 
‘proper action on the subject, is respectfully called to sections 39 and 
40 of the School Law as follows: 
Src. 39. Be it further enacted, That when the money derived 
from the school fund and taxes imposed by the State on the counties,
-P-A-G-E-177
[177] 
shall not be sufficient to keep up a public school for five months in 
the year, in the school districts in the county, the County Court 
shall levy an additional tax sufficient for this purpose, or shall sub- 
mit the proposition to a vote of the people, and may levy a tax to 
prolong the schools beyond the five months; said tax to be levied 
on all property, polls and privileges liable to taxation, but shall not 
exceed the entire State tax. 
Src. 40, Be it further enacted, That taxes so levied by the county 
shall be collected in the same manner as other county taxes, and 
shall be paid over to the County Trustee, for distribution among 
the school districts of the county, according to their scholastic pop- 
ulation. 
Tt was the purpose of the Legislature to provide for at least five 
months’ school each year. Lest the funds provided for by the gen- 
eral provisions of the law might prove insufficient, the duty of levy- 
ing a supplementary tax was imposed upon the County Courts in 
ease of such deficiency. In the circular Address accompanying the 
School Law, in pamphlet edition—a copy of which was furnished to 
each Magistrate in the State—it was demonstrated, by a satisfactory 
calculation, that the State poll-tax, the interest upon the permanent 
fund, and the proceeds of the one mill tax upon property, will not 
be sufficient to maintain the schools for five months in the year. I 
have since found no reason for questioning the result of that cal- 
culation. On the contrary, there is now the better reason for ques- 
tioning whether the fund realized will be as great as that assumed in 
the calculation referred to. 
I beg to again call special attention to the suggestions made in 
that Address, on the subject of an an additional tax by the counties, 
with full confidence that the Magistrates of the State are disposed to 
take all reasonable action that may be found necessary to comply 
with the requirements of the law, and to give the proposed system 
of Public Schools a fair trial. The amount of additional tax nec- 
essary in each county will depend, of course, upon the relative es- 
timates of scholastic population and taxable resources. In most of 
the counties an additional tax of one mill on the dollar, with a pro- 
portionate increase of the poll and privilege taxes, will sufitce. A 
large majority of the counties that have acted in the matter at all, 
have levied that much, and should the remaining counties all do as 
. P. T—12 :
-P-A-G-E-178
  [178] 
much, the success of our school system will be well assured. The 
additional time that would be added to the school term, by such a 
tax, would be the most valuable part of the term. Without it, the 
term will have to close about the time the results of the teacher’s in- 
struction begin to develop themselves. It is believed that a matter - 
of such vital importance needs only to be brought to the attention 
of the Magistrates to command their prompt and cheerful action. 
EXAMINATION FEES. 
To examine and license teachers is one of the duties of the County 
Superintendent. To discharge it faithfully will consume much of 
his time. The examinations of bona fide applicants will be numer- 
ous, while experienae has shown that many persons, without any 
design of teaching, will be disposed to try experiments with the 
Superintendent. Young men often seek teachers’ certificates as 
recommendations for business situations. ‘The Superintendent should 
have some protection against frivolous or experimental examinations. 
Under former laws (see Code,) the examiner’s fee was one dollar, 
The present law is silent on the subject. I respectfully suggest, 
therefore, that each County Court authorize its Superintendent to 
charge such applicant, whether successful or not, an examining fee 
of at least one dollar, to be paid into the County School Fund, or to 
‘go towards discharging whatever salary may be allowed to the 
Superintendent by the County Court. 
COMPENSATION TO SUPERINTENDENTS, 
The County Superintendent’s salary must be determined and al- 
lowed by the County Court. I trust I may be pardoned for suggesting 
that the services required of the Superintendent are of a character 
deserving liberal compensation. A thorough discharge of his duty 
will not, except in rare cases, admit of profitable attention to other 
business, and a person, competent to fill the office cannot be ex- 
pected to do so without a reward commensurate with the qualifica- 
tions required. 
ELECTION OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS. 
On the first Thursday in August next, an election will be held in 
every School District in the State, for the choice of District Direct- 
ors—three in each District. This is not a subject that falls within
-P-A-G-E-179
L179] 
the jurisdiction of the County Courts, but I have thought proper to 
¢all special attention to it here, in the hope that each Magistrate will 
become impressed with the importance of this approaching election, 
and will specially interest himself in awakening a proper feeling 
among the people of his district. Upon the District Boards will 
rest the immediate responsibility for the schools. No matter what 
the State and County Superintendents may do, unless the Districts 
are provided with competent and efficient Directors—men who have 
the welfare of the schools at heart—but little will be accomplished 
toward the proper education of the children. Three of the very 
best men in each District should be chosen as Directors. 
  
T have thought it proper to offer the foregoing suggestions, at this 
time, not in a spirit of dictation, but with the view of invoking, and 
in the hope of securing, the hearty co-operation of the Magistrates 
of Tennessee, in the great work of providing schools for the chil- 
dren of the State. Very respectfully, 
. : JNO. M. FLEMING, 
State Superintendent. 
P.S. A copy of this communication is sent to the Chairman of 
every County Court in the State. Some Courts have already elected 
Superintendents and levied sufficient tax...To such the suggestions 
in regard to those subjects are superfluous, and do not apply. A 
few have voted an insufficient additional tax. It is hoped that all 
such will complete their levies in July. J. M. F. *

INSTRUCTIONS 
TOUCHING THE MODE OF EXAMINING AND LICENSING SCHOOL. 
TEACHERS, AND THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. 
Stare SuPERINTENDENT’s OFFICE, |. 
NasHVILLE, JUNE, 1873. 
To County Superintendents of Public Instruction in Tennessee : 
The law makes it the duty of the State Superintendent “to pre- 
seribe the mode of examining and licensing school teachers, and their 
necessary qualifications.” In accordance with that requirement, the 
following instructions are issued : 
NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS. 
The qualifications necessary to entitle one to teach any of the Pub- 
lie Schools of Tennessee are declared to be: 
First—Good moral character. Second—Sufficient knowledge of 
the following Branches to give correct instruction therein, to-wit = 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, 
History of the United States. 
There being no text book on Elementary Geology of Tennessee 
yet prepared for use in the schools, proficiency in that branch will 
not, until so directed, be required. “Vocal Music is not required by 
the law to be taught in the schools, arid competency to teach it there- 
fore will not be counted as a necessary qualification of the teacher. 
MORAL CHARACTER. 
The moral character of the applicant for license is to be ascer- 
tained, either through the personal knowledge of the Superintend- 
ent, or satisfactory evidence to be furnished. No special amount or 
character of proof is prescribed. Whatever satisfies the mind of 
the Superintendent will suffice. : 
By. good moral character, is not meant a character evidenced by 
conformity to any special standard of religion, or denominational 
creed or ceremony. Reputable citizenship, respectability of social 
standing, freedom from notorious vices and gross immoralities, such 
as would bring reproach upon the profession of teaching and fur- 
nish hurtful examples to the young—these expressions rather con-
-P-A-G-E-181
[181] 
vey the idea here intended by the phrase “good moral character”; 
and such qualification should be held of primary importance by the 
Superintendent. An applicant, failing in this regard, need not be 
examined touching his or her intellectual qualifications. 
ATTAINMENTS IN SCHOLARSHIP—-HOW ASCERTAINED. 
The qualifications in scholarship must be ascertained by an exami- 
nation conducted by the County Superintendent or by his authority. 
Should a Superintendent for any good reason, not find it conve- 
nient or practicable to conduct the examination in person, he may 
‘designate some person in his county of known probity and compe- 
tence, to conduct the examination ; though the certificate must, in 
all cases, be signed by the Superintendent. Such. assistance, how- 
ever, must only be used with a view of securing thorough and satis- 
factory examinations, and not asa mere resort for shirking labor or 
responsibility. 
The mode of examination prescribed as most beneficial and satis- 
factory, is that by both written and oral questions and answers ; and 
this method is enjoined in all cases when practicable. A written 
examination will be found valuable, not only as touching the sub- 
‘stantial correctness of responses to the inquiries propounded, but as” 
furnishing at once, a test of penmanship, orthography, knoweledge 
_ of grammar and composition. Besides, being preserved, either in 
case of rejection or license, it may become important to the Super- 
intendent for future reference. A miscellaneous oral examination 
will be found important in developing the applicant’s general quali- 
fications, and, perhaps, in modifying in seme cases the results of the 
more specific written one. 
x 
NO SPECIAL FORMULA PRESCRIBED. 
For obvious reasons, no special formula, or line of interrogatories 
in the several branches, for general use, will be prescribed. To do 
so, would almost certainly place it within the power of incompetent 
persons, by special’ preparation upon the points indicated, to practice 
frauds upon the Superintendents. The details of the examination 
in this respect, are left to the discretion of the Superintendent, who 
may adopt a fixed formula for his own convenience, or vary his ex- 
amination as he may deem best under the circumstances.
-P-A-G-E-182
[say 
ATTAINMENT—HOW GRADED. 
The degree of attainment in each branch, must be graded accord- 
ing to aseale ranging from 1 to 10—ten being highest, one the lowest. 
‘When the average grade falls below five (except in extreme cases, 
the nature of which should be noted on the certificate,) the applicant 
should be rejected. 
. FORM OF CERTIFICATE. 
Upon a satisfactory result of an examination, the Superintendent | 
will issue a certificate to the applicant in the following form: 
TENNESSEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
TEACHER’S CERTIFICATE. 
It is hereby certified that......ccccsseresteseseeeees » known as a person 
of good moral character, and having passed a satisfactory examina- 
tion, is authorized to teach the branches specified below, (against 
each of which his [or her] grade of qualification is marked) in any 
of the Public Schools of ............-+. county, for which 
may be employed, for twelve months from this date.

County Superintendent. 
we eeee a tene eran eenee County, Tenn, 
  This certificate will be good only in the county for which it is 
issued, and for only twelve months from the date of issuance. 
The certificate itself is not graded. In view of the peculiar con- 
dition of our educational affairs, now existing, it is deemed’ imprac- 
ticable to establish uniform and unvarying standards of qualifica- 
tion for teachers throughout the State. In many of the schools, 
only primary instruction will be required. An applicant for license 
may grade well in Orthography, Reading and Writing, and yet 
prove deficient in Grammar, Arithmetic and Geography. The sev-
-P-A-G-E-183
[183] . 
eral branches being graded in the certificate, will indicate to the 
District Boards the licentiate’s special attainments and deficiences, 
For like reasons, the grade in Theory and Practice of Teaching 
is, for the present, omitted from the calculation of the general av- 
erage, though in all cases it should be ascertained and marked in 
the certificate. By this adaptation to circumstances just now pre- 
vailing, it is not meant to under-estimate’ the importance of profi- 
ciency in the art of teaching. On the contrary, the grade is now 
inserted to indicate its future incorporation in the certificate as a 
necessary qualification as well as to show present attainment in that 
particular. The ultimate teachers’ standard, in this State, must be 
attained by gradual approaches. 
MISCELLANEOUS, 
Questions of age, physical condition and the like, as affecting the 
applicant’s capacity to govern a school, are left to the judgment of 
the County Superintendent. 
In cases where “ contracts of consolidation,” as allowed by sec- 
tion 33 of the school law, have been made with the teachers or 
authorities of private or other established schools, certificates may 
be issued to the teachers of such schools, without examination, 
should the Superintendent be satisfied in regard to qualifications. 
The provisions of section 26 render the issuance of certificates in 
such cases important, since, without the certificate, no teacher can 
“receive any pay from the public funds.” 
Stated days should be announced by the Superintendent on which 
at a specified place the examination of applicants for license will be 
attended to. This plan will not only accommodate persons desiring 
license, but will enable the Superintendent to economize his time by 
conducting several examinations at once. Upon special demand, 
however, an examination may be attended to at any time when 
practicable. 
Each Superintendent will be expected to keep a record of the 
number of examinations made and licenses granted, showing color 
and sex and make return thereof in his regular report. A record 
of the certificate can be conveniently kept on the stub of the blank 
as furnished to each Superintendent. 
Minor rules and regulations, not in conflict with these general in- 
structions, may be adopted by each Superintendent for the regula-
-P-A-G-E-184
[ 184] 
tion of his own office, as his judgment may suggest or immediate 
circumstances require. 
The foregoing instructions are issued under a due sense of the 
fficulty of adapting general regulaticns to the diversified wants of 
an entire State’s scholastic population, as yet unorganized for the 
teacher’s care. They are not fashioned in their liberality after thé 
methods of older and maturer systems, but if strictly observed ac- 
cording to their spirit, are believed to be sufficiently rigid for the 
work for which they are designed. In matters of detail, much has 
been left to the discretion of the County Superintendent. Pru- 
dence, firmness, impartiality, should characterize each Superin- 
tendent’s conduct in the election of teachers. Though we may not 
now set up a satisfactory standard of excellence, much may be done 
to protect the schools from the curse of incompetency. 
To elevate the standard should be the aim of every Superin- 
tendent. : :

INCORPORATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
SratE SUPERINTENDENT’sS OFFICE, 
NasHVILLeE, July 21, 1873. 
Yo the County Superintendents : 
The law makes it the “ duty of the County Superintendents to 
report to the Chancery Courts of their respective counties, a list of 
the several School Districts now or hereafter established, and the 
Directors in their several counties,” for the purpose of having them 
_“entéred upon the minutes of the Court,” as incorporated School 
towns. The proper mode of doing this is by petition and decree. 
To faciliate this part of your duty, I have prepared and herewith 
submit to you the form of a report and petition and decree which 
will be sufficient for all the puxposes of the law. : 
Tt will be well to present the petition and secure the decree at the 
first term of the Chancery Court for your county, after the August 
‘ election. No process or proceedings will be necessary, other than
-P-A-G-E-185

the presentation of the petition in Court and the entering of the 
decree upon the minutes of Court, by order of the Chancellor. 
You can present the petition in person, if you choose, though any 
lawyer will take pleasure in presenting it for you gratuitously. 
The law makes no provision for the payment of the costs of the 
proceeding. They will amount to but little, and I think ought to’ 
he certified to the County Court for payment. 
Very respectfully, 
JOHN M. FLEMING, 
: State Superintendent.

PEABODY EDUCATION FUND. 
‘INSTRUCTIONS IN REGARD TO AID FROM THE PEA- 
: BODY FUND. 
Srare SUPERINTENDENT’S OFEICE, 
NasHVILLE, August, 27, 1878. 
To the County Superintendent : 
I send you herewith a supply of blank applications for aid from 
the Peabody Fund, which you are requested to furnish to parties in 
your county desiring to make such application. My reasons tor thus 
calling your official attention to this matter may be briefly ex- 
plained. . 
It is designed by the Trustees of the Peabody Fund, as set forth 
by Dr. Sears in his instructions to me, that so much of the Fund as 
may be distributed to Tennessee, shall be made strictly auxiliary to 
our State System of Public Schools. To this end, I am instructed 
to accept applications only from Public School authorities. There- 
fore, all such applications should come primarily from the Boards of 
District Directors, and only from them when they are in a situation _ 
to comply with all the conditions, precedent and consequent, as set 
forth in the blanks herewith sent to you. 
It is proper that I should also explain to you, and specially call 
your attention to the fact, that the Peabody Fund is not designed , 
to take the place of a mere charity fund for the relief of indigent 
communities, or the fostering of ephemeral schools, affording no
-P-A-G-E-194
[ 194] 
promise of permanency. An extract or two from the letter of Dr. 
Sears will better explain the real design. He says: 
“We have concluded to continue substantially the policy of last 
year in regard to Tennessee, giving nearly the same amount, and 
observing the same rules. As applications for aid are becoming very 
numerous, we must not relax our rules, but require a strict compli- 
ance with them. Our aim is to have all the schools, aided by us, 
model, graded. schools, kept through the year, thus giving example of 
‘what public schools should be. Let every Peabody school do credit 
to the system which they are designed to promote. The way to win 
favor for public schools is to make them better than private schools, 
and to keep them through the year. This is the special aim of our 
Fund. * * * The smaller country schools, although not as- 
sisted by us now, will feel the effect of our success when the State 
system gets into vigorous operation. The people will then make 
the best possible legal provision for the districts of a sparser popu- 
lation.” 
Again he says: 
“We are not attempting to dispense a charity to the most needy, 
but to promote a system of universal education which shall ulti- 
mately reach all the poor by including them in the general sys- 
tem, * * * When the end we have -in view is not secured, no 
amount of destitution can be made a sufficient ‘plea for receiving an 
application.” : 
From these extracts you will readily discover the general princi- 
ple by which the State Superintendent will be guided in making his 
recommendations for aid. And I especially enjoin it upon you to let 
the same principle govern you invariably in your endorsement of 
applications. Under the fresh impulse which the educational feeling 
has received in Tennessee, a very general desire to obtain all the aid 
possible has been developed, and while we should do nothing to re- 
press this longing of the people for better school facilities, the in- 
sufficiency of the allotted fund to meet all the bona fide demands 
that will be made, should admonish both State and County Super- 
intendents that too much care cannot be exercised in making recom- 
t mendations for aid. The value of the Peabody Fund as.an auxiliary 
to our Public School system, if discreetly administered, can hardly 
be estimated. If squandered, without judgment and strict regard to  
-P-A-G-E-195
[195 J 
its true purpose, its influence will be as short-lived as the temporary 
schools upon which it may be wasted. Therefore, discarding all 
other considerations, let your recommendations, in all cases, be con- 
trolled by a conscientious purpose to encourage and give stability 
and acceptability to our Public School system. To this end, you 
will not be expected to recommend any school that is not to be’ab- 
solutely under the management of Public School authorities. 
‘When two or more application are made from your county, I re- 
quest that you indicate to me the order in which they should be pre- 
ferred, giving briefly the reasons upon which such preference should 
be founded. 
The blanks when properly filled, should be immediately forwarded 
to this office, enclosed in a large-sized envelope. 
Very respectfully, 
JOHN M. FLEMING, 
State Superintendent. 
AID FROM THE PEABODY FUND. 
Stare SUPERINTENDENT’S OFFICE, 
NASHVILLE, Aueust, 1878. 
The proceeds of the Peabody Fund, allotted to Tennessee for the 
ensuing scholastic year, will be distributed only through and to the 
Public School officers, and therefore need be applied for only by 
lawfully constituted local School authorities. Applications will be 
made through the several County Superintendents to the State Su- 
perintendent, who will forward such as he may approve, with his 
endorsement, to Dr. B. Sears, General Agent, for final action. 
Before any application can be considered, a strict compliance with 
the following conditions must be satisfactorily guaranteed : 
1. The School, for which aid is asked, must be a Public Free 
School, under the contro] of the lawfully constituted local School 
authorities, — 
2. It must have a bona fide enrollment of not less than one hun- . 
dred pupils, averaging eighty-five per day.
-P-A-G-E-196
[196] 
3. It must have an assured fund for current expenses, amounting: 
to at least twice as much as the aid received from the Fund. 
4, It must be a graded school. 
5, A teacher must be furnished for every fifty pupils at most. 
6. Two copies of the following blanks must be filled up and sub- 
scribed by the proper parties, and returned to the State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction at Nashville. 
(Blank to be signed by District Directors, or City Board or Committee, as the case 
may be.) 
We respectfully ask for aid from the Peabody Fund, for a Public 
Free School to be under our lawful control, and located at.....-...... 
County of.........0.6. We will be able to comply with all the above 
conditions. Should we, at any time, fail to do so, we bind ourselves 
to report the fact immediately to the State Superintendent of Public. 
Instruction at Nashville, Tennessee.

(Certificate to be signed by the County Superintendent.) 
I certify that the persons whose genuine signatures appear to the 
foregoing application are the lawfully constituted and acting Direct- 
ors of School District No......... Of. ceeeaseeeeeees County. I am satis- 
fied that they will be able to faithfully comply with the imposed 
conditions. I recommend that the desired aid be granted, believing 
that the fostering of said schools will contribute to the promotion 
and permanent establishment of our Public school interests.

For further information to applicants, the following extract from 
the proceedings of the Peabody Board of Trustees is presented.

In doubtful cases of attendance, the average number decides the 
‘question. The amount appropriated for larger numbers in cities 
cannot be fixed, but must depend on circumstances. The people are 
to pay for current expenses at least twice, and usually three times as 
much as they receive from the fund, and to bear all the expenses of 
erecting and repairing and furnishing school-houses. They are to 
grade their schools and provide a teacher for every fifty pupils. It 
‘is necessary that applications for assistance be made through the Su- 
perintendent of each State, near the beginning of the school year. 
No claim for a share of the Fund can be admitted where a special 
contract has not been previously made. 
The. regulations for colored schools are the same as for white 
schools. The number of pupils required applies to each class of 
schools separately. This is necessary, in order that the schools may 
be properly graded.

_ TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
EAST TENNESSEE. 
OFFICE OF County SUPERINTENDENT, 
JonEsBORO, TENN., Dec. 8, 1874. 
‘Hon. John M. Fleming, Superintendent Public Instruction, Nashville: 
Dear Srr: At your request, I transmit a brief statement of the 
proceedings of the Teachers’ Institutes for East Tennessee, held 
during the months of July and August, 1874. 
The Institutes were opened at the times and places designated in 
your circular, and were conducted substantially upon the plan sug- 
gested in the official announcement as given below: 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES FOR EAST TENNESSEE. | 
The three Teachers’ Institutes for East Tennessee, under the au- 
thority of the State Superintendent, will be held as follows: 
At Cleveland, July 20; at Knoxville, August 3; Limestone, 
August 17. Each Institute will continue in session one week. 
During the day time, instruction will be given in school govern- 
ment and in all the branches required to be taught in the public 
schools of the State, a3 well as in the best methods of teaching those 
branches. The evenings will be devoted to public lectures from 
persons of experience and eminence as educators. 
These Institutes will all be underthe professional charge of Prof. 
H. Presnell, Superintendent of Washington county, assisted by 
Prof. 8. Z. Sharp, of Maryville, and others. They will be open to
-P-A-G-E-200
[ 200 ] 
teachers from all parts of the State, and the teachers of private 
schools are respectfully invited to attend and participate in the ex- 
ercises. : : 
A complete programme for each Institute will be published in 
due time. Jno. M. Fiemine, 
State Superintendent. 
Knowville, June 17, 1874, 
In order that the teachers might have a full understanding of the 
nature and scope of the work to be done in these Institutes, the 
following programme was prepared and sent to all the County Su- 
perintendents in East Tennessee : 
ORDER OF DAILY EXERCISES—8:30 A. M. 
Devotional exercises and rolJ call, 15 minutes. 
Class in vocal elements, 15 minutes. 
Class in reading, 30 minutes. 
Class in mental arithmetic, 20 minutes.

1:30 P. M. 
Class in penmanship or drawing, 20 minutes. 
Class in geography, with map-drawing, 30 minutes. 
Class in United States History, 20 minutes. 
Recess. 
Class in spelling, oral or written, 30 minutes. 
Miscellaneous business. 
7:30 TO 9 P.M. 
Public lectures on educational and other important subjects. 
In conducting these Institutes, the actual work of the school-room 
was kept steadily in view. I was fortunate in the selection of my 
colleague, Prof. 8, Z. Sharp, a gentleman well versed in school 
matters generally, and specially skilled in the art of teaching school. 
At Cleveland, where we held the first one, every accommodation at 
the command of the citizens was most cordially extended to the 
members of the Institute. The teachers were enthusiastic, and, in 
most cases; the classes were large and interesting. The day sessions 
Dow 
wpe
-P-A-G-E-201
[201] 
were given to class-drills and actual school work, and the night ses- 
sions to public lectures. We had a good audience during the session. 
The attendance was good, 10 ministers of gospel, 20 school Direct- 
ors, 7 County Superintendents, 70 teachers, and the members of the 
Cleveland bar, and other friends of education. 
At the close of the session, a Teachers’ Institute for Bradley 
County was organized. _ 
At Knoxville we had a grand meeting. In addition to the reg- 
ular school work, the subject of school management was largely 
discussed by such eminent educators as Prof. R. L. Kirkpatrick, Prof. 
M. ©. Butler, Rev. Dr. Mays, and others. The attendance on the 
meetings, the enthusiasm of the teachers and general interest man- 
ifested, are the evidences we bring to you of the success of the 
Knoxville Institute. The enrollment of teachers exceeded one hun- 
dred, besides school Directors, lawyers, doctors, editors, and promi- 
nent business men, 
Among the teachers were representatives from several States, 
ladies and gentlemen who qccupy prominent positions as educators. 
Knoxville extended the most cordial hospitality to the teachers 
and other friends of education in attendance. 
At Limestone, the Institute was, if possible, more practical than 
at either of the other points. Theory and practice were more fully 
illustrated, especially in conducting the primary classes. The ex- 
perience gathered from the other Institutes taught us that the 
greatest deficiency exists in primary teaching. Hence special attention 
was given to the primary branches, especially those specified in the 
school law. We had in attendance teachers, Directors, editors, law- 
yers, and ministers of the gospel. 
To the County Superintendents and teachers generally, we were 
under many obligations for favors and courtesies extended, but es- 
pecially so to Superintendent Sharp, of Bradley, Superintendent 
Karns, of Knox, Prof. R..L. Kirkpatrick of the East Tennessee 
University, Prof. Butler, of Knoxville, Prof. Brown, of Mossy 
Creek, Prof. Wilson, of Morristown, and Prof. Tade, of Tusculum 
College. Not less than 250 teachers took part in the Institutes, 
among whom were the teachers of private schools, Professors of Col- 
leges, Academies, and other institutions. °

MIDDLE TENNESSEE. 
OrricE or County SUPERINTENDENT, 
Puaski, Tenn., Sept. 1, 1874. 
Col.. John M. Fleming, Sup’t of Publie Instruction: 
Dear Srr:—In compliance avith your instructions to transmit a 
succinct statement of the proceedings of the Teachers’ Institute for 
Middle Tennessee, held during the months of July and August, 
1874, I respectfully submit the following report: 
The Institutes were opened, respectively, at the places and on the 
dates mentioned in your circular, and were conducted upor the plan 
indicated in your published announcement, as given below: 
SratE SUPERINTENDENT'S OrFice, 
NASHVILLE, June, 1874, 
The four Teachers’ Institutes for Middle Tennessee, under the 
authority of the State Superintendent, will beheld as follows: At 
Shelbyville, July 20; at Columbia, July 27; at Lebanon, August 
3; at Clarksville, August 10. Each Inttitute will continue in ses- 
sion one week. During the day-time, instruction will be given in 
school government, and in all the branches required to be taught in 
the public schools of the State, as well as in the best methods of 
teaching those branches. The evenings will be “devoted to public 
lectures from persons of experience and eminence as educators and 
friends of education. . 
These Institutes will all be under the professional charge of Prof. 
W. R. Garrett, County Superintendent for Giles county, assisted by 
Prof. H. H. Smith, of Shelbyville, and others. They will be open 
for teachers from all parts of the State, and teachers of private 
schools are respectfully invited to attend and participate in the exer- 
cises. A complete programme for each Institute will be prepared 
and published in due time. The County Superintendents of Bed- 
ford, Maury, Wilson, and Montgomery, respectively, will be ex- 
pected to superintend whatever local preparations may be necessary 
for the holding of the Institute and the entertainment of teachers. 
JNO. M. FLEMING, 
State Superintendent. 
At each Institute there will be three sessions a day, as follows: 
Morning sessions, from 9 A. M. to 12m. Evening sessions, from 2 
p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Night sessions, from 8 Pp. M. to 9:30 P. M,
-P-A-G-E-203
[203] 
During the first three’ days, classes will be drilled in the various 
branches embraced in the school law, followed by discussion i in the 
order given below: 
Mondays—morning session. Writing and U. S. History. 
Evening session. Spelling and reading (chart and card method 
explained). : . 
Tuesdays—morning session. Geography (with map-drawing). 
Evening session. English grammar and composition. 
Wednesdays—morning session. Primary arithmetic. 
Evening session. Practical arithmetic. 
On the two remaining days, Thursday and Friday, the Institute 
will be conducted as a school—class recitations regularly heard, and: 
the order of exercises announced on each morning. 
Night sessions will be devoted to public lectures on educational 
and literary subjects. During the sessions of the Institute, essays 
will be read on School Discipline, Calisthenics, Object Teaching, 
Best Method of Securing the Co-operation of Parents, Relation of 
Education to Future Life, and other educational subjects. 
In conducting the first official Institutes held in Middle Tennes- 
see, my colleague, Prof. Smith and myself had no precedents to 
guide us. Agreeing, however, in the opinion that the foundation of 
an education should be carefully laid, we directed the exercises al- 
most exclusively to the primary branches. In accordance with your 
instructions, we presented the objective and inductive methods of 
teaching, and endeavored, to the best of our ability, to illustrate 
their use and demonstrate their excellence. The discussion of each 
branch of study was opened by one of the conductors, with an essay 
or lecture, in which was considered: 1. How many years should 
be devoted to this branch of study? 2. At what rate of progress 
should pupils be advanced through the different grades? 3. What 
methods of instruction should be employed? 4. What aids, or il- 
lustrations from objects, can be used with advahtage in this branch? 
5. When a school is not so organized as to afford the teacher facili- 
ties for using the proper aids and methods, how can the want best 
be supplied ? 
A class was then formed, and the methods of instruction, suited 
to different. stages of advancement in this branch, were illustrated 
by actual class-drill. The subject was then open for general discus- 
sion. Teachers and others present entered into these discussions
-P-A-G-E-204
[ 204] 
with warmth and candor, freely expressing their views on the best 
methods to be employed. Various opinions were expressed as to 
the relative merits of different methods, but the general sentiment 
seemed decidedly in favor of object-teaching and the inductive 
method, especially with primary classes. It also seemed to be gen- 
erally conceded that the primary branches require. more time and 
attention than they have received in the past. 
The total number of school officers and teachers present at the 
Institutes was 219, making an average at each of nearly 55. The 
attendance of the public, though at some points not so large as we 
had hoped to find it, was generally encouraging, and sufficient to 
indicate that the people are beginning to direct their attention to 
educational reforms, and to the introduction of uniformity and sys- 
tem into the management of education. At Shelbyville, the attend- 
ance, both of teachers and of the public, was larger than at any 
other point, and, according to the estimate of the President, Prof. 
John R.‘Dean, was about 400. . 
At each point where an Institute was held, we endeavored to 
leave a permanent organization. 
The following named gentlemen were elected for one year Presi- 
dents of the Institutes, respectively : 
Shelbyville, Prof. John R. Dean; Columbia, Prof. J. H. Wilkes ; 
Lebanon, Prof. A. D. Norris; Clarksville, Prof. N. L. Whitfield. 
We were indebted to the Faculty of Cumberland University, and 
to the faculties of various colleges and academies and seminaries, 
and to the teachers of private as well as public schools for valuable 
assistance in conducting the exercises of the Institutes. 
Many gentlemen of ability and eloquence, though not engaged 
in the work of education, consented to occupy the night sessions 
with public addresses on educational or literary subjects. 
At every point the most ample provisions were made for the en- 
tertainment of teacheys and others in attendance, and the most cor- 
dial hospitality was offered. Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. GARRETT.

WEST TENNESSEE. 
Mempuis, TENN., Nov. 24, 1874. 
To the Hon. J. M. Fleming, State Superintendent of Publie In- 
struction, Nashville : 
According to appointment a Teachers’ Institute was called to 
meet at Jackson, Tenn., Aug. 17. 
B. R. Campbell, Superintendent of Madison County, had ¢ circu~ 
lated ample notice, and aided by a committee of the citizens of Jack- 
son, made provision for the free entertainment of teachers. All 
other needful arrangements were made with promptness and care 
for a large attendance. The time, however, proved ¢ to be very un- 
favorable. The call was made in the midst of\a ‘severe drought 
that was paralyzing all kinds of business, and throwing doubts upon 
every project. The threatening aspect of the Givil Rights Bill 
seemed to be regarded as rendering the existence’ of the public 
schools doubtful, so through doubts without and doubts within, the 
attendance was ‘rendered very light. Still the earnest and intelli- 
gent spirit, for the public school of those wlio did attend, and the 
spirit of liberality shown by the people of Jackson, invitin all to 
free homes during the week, spoke well for Institutes! and free 
schools when these obstacles shall all be removed. Among the 
leading teachers present were Messrs. Wright, of Pinson; B. R. 
Campbell, J. K. Campbell, J. H. Clark, of Jackson; A. R. Turner, 
Medina; J. B. Carn, Denmark; W. N. Hanna,*-Warren; Cuthbert, 
Brownsville, and others. 
TRENTON. 
The same impediments stood in the way of thorough success at 
this place. The attendance, however, was better. The Institute 
was organized Monday evening, Aug. 24. A. S. Currey, County 
Superintendent of Gibson County, was called te the chair, and W. 
L. Shropshire, County Superintendent of Obion county, was elected 
Secretary. The Institute was carried forward through the week 
with manifest interest and profit. 
The citizens of Trenton showed great prompiness and liberality 
in supplying all with free homes and in procuring all needed ac- 
commodations. As a whole, the indications for the public school 
were good. When the great obstacles are taken away, the people 
will move without hesitation to the support of the institution which
-P-A-G-E-206
[ 206] 
. above all others leads a State on to greatness. The Secretary will 
give details. 
MEMPHIS. 
Col. Tyler, County Superintendent of Shelby County, with others 
interested in the public schools, considering the time too unfavor- 
able, deemed a postponement of the appointment at Memphis 
advisable. _ A. PICKETT.

University of Nashville, Nashville, E. Kirby Smith, Chancellor, ' 
was founded, endowed and incorporated in 1785 by special Act of 
the Legislature of North Carolina, under the name of Davidson 
Aeademy. Under its charter it has the widest. limits as a Univer- 
sity, and can confer all the post graduate degrees. Professors and - 
tutors, 10; students, 187; gross receipts from patrons, $15,000.00. 
University of the South, Sewanee, Gen. J. Gorgas, Vice Chancellor, 
for the last scholastic year, had a corps of 9 professors and 9 teach-

dents were enrolled. Gross receipts, $20,500.00. 
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Bishop H. N. McTyeire, Presi- 
dent, was founded and endowed by Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, of 
New York, in 1873, by a donation of. $600,000.00. Not more than 
one-half of this sum is to be expended on buildings, grounds and 
furniture ; the balance to be kept a prospective fund, the interest 
only to be used in carrying on the institution. 
The University is located in the western suburbs of Nashville, on 
a plot of ground covering 75 acres. The main building was begun 
September, 1873, and will be completed by the spring of 1875. It 
will cost over $100,000.00. There are now in course of building 
seven professors’ houses. Besides, there are two commodious dwell- 
ings bought with the grounds. One of these will be used as a pro- 
fessor’s dwelling, the other, a larger house, will for the present be 
devoted to the accommodation of young men studying for the min- 
istry. This building occupies a commanding site, that is expected, 
at some future day, to be adorned by a building, designed and de- 
voted to the accommodation and education of Biblical students.

The grounds are highly eligible, within half a mile of the corpora- 
tion line; and they are capable of fine ornamentation. At present 
they are being put into condition for use in a substantial and taste- 
ful way. / 
The co-education of those who look to the Christian ministry, 
with young men who look to other vocations and business in life, is 
‘to be a feature of the Vanderbilt University plan. This, it is 
thought, will be mutually beneficial, and avoid the ascetic and 
monastic element in clerical training. 
The University was projected and chartered in 1872; but was 
without funds—only a plan and purpose formed by the leading 
Methodist ministers and laymen of Middle and West Tennessee, 
North Mississippi, North Alabama, and Arkansas. The munificent 
gift of Mr. Vanderbilt at once furnished it life and foundation. 
The Board of Trust, on receiving the donation, in grateful acknowl- 
edgement of the same, resolved unanimously to change the name of 
the chartered institution from the “ Central University of the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church, South,” to the VANDERBILT UnYversiry. 
Mr. Vanderbilt made his donation through Bishop McTyeire, of 
the M. E. Church, South; and one of its few conditions was that he 
should consent to act as President of the Board of Trustees, and 
carry out his benevolent intentions. He considered the geographi- 
cal position of the State of Tennessee and its Capital, its communi- 
cations with the world, its population, its climate and’ productive- 
~ ness, and its relations to the great and growing South-west, and 
here decided for the greatest good to the South and West, to estab- 
lish an institution of learning of the highest order, furnished with 
library and apparatus equal to its demands. His great and practical 
wisdom, so well and universally conceded, conveys, in this selection. 
“of our State and our Capital for the seat of such an enterprise, a 
compliment that our people will appreciate, as well as a benefit to 
them and future generations, for which they will be grateful. 
The Vanderbilt University will be opened formally in the fall of 
1875, in its four departments: Literature and Science, Theology, 
Law, and Medicine. Classes in the latter two departments have 
already been formed, and are in course of instruction and préepara- 
tion. 
_ There are to be eleven chairs in the first department, four in the 
~ second, and ten in each of the last two. The Law and Medical
-P-A-G-E-213
[ 213] 
‘faculties have already been elected. Judge Wm. F. Cooper is Dean 
of the Law, and Dr. Thomas Menees is Dean of the Medical faculty. 
In the Department of Literature and Science, several eminent 
scholars have been elected, and others will be soon. The Theologi- 
cal department has, as yet, but two professors elect. The Board 
moves cautiously, and is resolved to obtain the best educating talent. 
The Professors of Chemistry and Natural Science are now in Europe 
purchasing apparatus for their respective schools. 
An agent, Rey. Dr. Young, is engaged with success in raising a 
fund, the interest of which is to be used in paying the board, or 
assisting in bearing this expense, of needy and well recommended 
young men who are studying for the ministry. The amount aimed 
at, on this account, is $200,000.00—and already about $60,000.00 
has been subscribed, and the prospect is good for the full amount. 
Ward’s Seminary for Young Ladies, Nashville, Rev. W. E. Ward, 
Principal, was founded in September, 1865, and incorporated Feb- 
ruary, 1869, with power to confer the degree of Mistress of Arts. 
“Its departments are Preparatory and Collegiate, the latter course 
requiring five years. A Library of 2,000 volumes is connected 
with the institution, together with philosophical and chemical appara- 
tus, and cabinets of minerals and geological specimens. The French, 
German, Italian, and Spanish languages, Music—Instrumental and 
‘Vocal—Drawing and Painting, are taught in connection with the

pupils in regular course last year, 189; irregular, 52; total, 241. 
Teachers, 17. Value of buildings and furniture, $70,000.00. The 
Seminary is under no religious denomination. All pupils attend 
their own Church. Total graduates of this school, 324; graduates 
now teachers, 41; graduates in June, 1874, 48. 
Wesleyan Female College, Brownsville, was chartered by special 
Act of the Legislature, and confers the usual college degrees.

ScHoot Deposits in BANK oF TENNESSEE. 
. NasHvILie, Tenn., Dec. 28, 1874, 
Hon. John M. Fleming, Sup’t of Public Instruction : 
Str :—I had expected before this date to be able to communicate 
to you the decision of the Supreme Court, sitting at Nashville, Ten- 
nessee, in the case of Samuel Watson, Trustee, etc., v. The Bank of 
Tennessee and others. The decision will be made, as I am now ad- 
vised, early in January, after the Court reconvenes. It is not pos- 
sible to forecast the result in said cause in regard to the proceeds 
of the school lands held in trust by the Bank of Tennessee as part 
of its assets at the beginning and close of the war. I have investi- 
gated the cause, as the same has been presented to the Supreme 
Court. In a case of such magnitude, it is desirable to have an 
opinion’ settling all the points involved. But I much fear that 
proper issues are not before the Court in said cause, either in the 
pleadings or proofs, to present in full force all the rights and equi- 
ties of.the beneficiaries in said proceeds of the school lands. In 
the event the Supreme Court shall so conclude, further litigation 
will be necessary. 
I suggest, in this connection, that you recommend to.the Legis- 
lature, if deemed necessary, when said decision shall have been 
made, the propriety of an Act conferring on the Superintendent of Pub- 
lic Instruction the power to institute legal proceedings in the name 
of the State for the use and benefit of the beneficiaries in said school 
fund: arising from the sales of school lands, and which were depos- 
ited in the Bank of Tennessee under the legislation of this State. 
Lherewith transmit a copy of a statement in regard to said fund 
furnished to me by Judge Samuel Watson, Trustee, ete. Tt is here- 
with transmitted as a part of this communication.
-P-A-G-E-215
  [215] - 
Iam much gratified to observe the great interest and vigilance 
manifested by you in the discharge of your official duties in regard to 
the progress of said cause, and the interest of the beneficiaries 
therein, as well as in reference to the entire educational interests of 
the State. 
Just so soon as said cause shall be decided, I shall be ready to 
proceed to take such additional steps as may be necessary to en- 
_ deavor to secure to those so justly entitled the rights they claim in 
said trust fund. Very respectfully, 
ss JAMES W. McHENRY.

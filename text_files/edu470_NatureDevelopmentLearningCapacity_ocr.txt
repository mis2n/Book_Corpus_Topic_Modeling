PREFACE 
The science of education rests primarily upon the science 
of psychology, particularly that branch of psychology which 
deals with the nature and development of children. 
The following experiments are reported in the hope that 
they may make some slight contribution to the psychology 
of child development. Working out this problem in exten- 
sive and complete fashion will require the patient work of 
many investigators for many years. The extensive work 
must be financed by the state and national governments, 
by wealthy private individuals, or by endowments. 
The experiments reported here were made possible by 
small grants from the University of Missouri. I wish to 
acknowledge the co-operation of Deans J. H. Coursault and 
M. G. Neale, President Stratton D. Brooks and former 
President J. C. Jones, of the University of Missouri. In 
most of the later experiments I have had the valuable 
assistance of Mr. E. L. Schott.

NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT 
OF 
LEARNING CAPACITY 
CHAPTER I 
AIMS AND METHODS 
The Problem.—The purpose of the studies reported in 
this book is to discover the nature and course of mental 
development with particular reference to the development 
of learning capacity. Some of the questions which we 
try to answer are: What is the course of development of 
the ability to learn? How does the rate of development in 
one year compare with the rates in other years? Is the 
development of one aspect of learning different from the 
development of other aspects? In other words, to what 
extent is learning a general function and to what extent is 
it a specific function? What are the sex differences in 
learning capacity? Are there any sex differences in 
variability? How great are mental differences in children 
of the same age? How much overlapping is there in the 
frequency surfaces of adjacent years and of adjacent grades? 
What is the nature of the difference in learning capacity 
of good and poor learners? What differences are there 
between city and country children with reference to mental 
development? What are the racial differences in capacity 
to learn? What bearing do the answers to these various

  10 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
questions have on problems of teaching and administration 
in the public schools? Finally, what light do our results 
throw upon the question of the nature of learning 
capacity? 
The Experiments.—The experimental studies considered 
here have covered a period of ten years and include studies 
of negroes, Indians, and Chinese, as well as more extensive 
studies of white American children in both city and country. 
The most important experiments, however, are those on 
the nature and development of learning capacity which have 
been carried out in the last two years. The total number 
of children studied is about fifteen thousand. A detailed 
description will be given here of only the more recent work, 
since the results of the earlier studies have already been 
published. 
The plan of procedure in these experiments has been to 
study the development of school children with reference to 
several different aspects of learning capacity. I have 
tried especially to measure, in addition to the ordinary 
types of ideational learning, those types of learning properly 
called habit formation, or sensori-motor learning. This 
type of learning has been somewhat neglected in recent 
mental measurement. 
The experiments have all been planned on the assumption 
that learning is connecting. In habit formation learning is 
connecting stimulus with response. In ideational learning, 
the connection established is between ideas, or, more prop- 
erly speaking, between the cortical activities underlying 
the ideas. The various kinds of learning, therefore, involve 
different types of stimuli and different types of response. 
I shall give here only a general description of the different 
experiments, for they are described in: detail as they are 
severally discussed in the following pages.
-P-A-G-E-9
  AIMS AND METHODS 11 
The card-sorting experiment consists merely in sorting 
cards according to number. The stimulus is the number. 
The response is putting the card containing the number into 
a particular place which is assigned the same number. 
This is a very simple experiment of a very simple type 
of learning and can be given to children as soon as they 
know the Arabic numbers. 
The marble-sorting experiment consists in sorting colors 
instead of numbers and is more complicated than card- 
sorting in that there are two sets of associations formed. 
In the first place, the colors of balls are associated with the 
forms of well-known animals. In the second place the 
animals are associated with certain locations on the box 
into which the balls are placed. This test can be given to 
children of any age inasmuch as it is not necessary to know 
the names of the colors. The experiment has the defect 
that it can not be given to color-blind children. 
The manthanometer experiment is a sorting experiment 
also, but wholly different from the other two sorting experi- 
ments in that it involves a high degree of concentration and 
the ability to keep several processes in mind throughout the 
experiment. The subject produces his own stimulus by 
pressing an electric button. The stimulus is a colored 
disc which may be large or small and he must react both 
to its color and its size. The reaction consists of getting 
and placing a ball with the right hand and also with the 
left at the same time, while the feet manipulate pedals 
which direct the course of some of the balls. 
The substitution experiment consists in associating letters 
with digits. The stimulus is the digit; the response is writing 
the proper letter. This experiment can be given only to 
children who know the digits and can make the letters
-P-A-G-E-10

of the alphabet. It can not be used below the third grade 
and not with much success below the’ fourth grade. 
The mirror experiment is a measure of trial-and-error 
learning. It consists in drawing when the stimulus is a 
reflection from a mirror which is vertical in front of the 
subject’s hand. This experiment involves the breaking 
up of habits already formed. It is rather difficult for every- 
body and particularly for young children. 
The ideational experiments are devised to measure that 
type of learning that is most common in school in all but 
the lowest grades. It consists in getting the meaning from 
printed stories. 
The mental tests consist of two types of material: learning 
tests and tests of the organization of previous experience. 
They are therefore a more general measure of intelligence 
than either of the specific learning experiments and are 
included in this study chiefly for comparison with the 
learning experiments. 
THE PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL CLINIC 
If procedure in American public schools is ever to be 
established on a scientific basis we must have a psycho- 
educational clinic as a part of every school system. The 
conductor of this clinic must be trained in psychology and 
psychological methods. He must be trained in methods of 
experimentation with special reference to school children. 
Every child should proceed through the course of study 
at a pace commensurate with his ability and development. 
The bright should go fast, the dull much more slowly. 
Different types of pupils should have different courses of 
study. In settling questions concerning ability the teacher 
should have the assistance of an expert. 
The psycho-educational expert should have a well 
equipped laboratory and should be provided with every
-P-A-G-E-11
  AIMS AND METHODS 13 
aid which science can give. It is the author’s hope that 
this study will furnish methods and norms which will be 
of service in such a clinic. = 
When the proposal is made to school boards to establish 
such a clinic, they will doubtless object on the ground of the 
added expense involved. But it is certain that what we 
would save by doing the proper thing for every child would 
pay a hundred times over for the cost of running such a 
clinic as is here proposed. It is not economical to run a 
school on the shotgun method. 
Under the present condition of things we do not know: 
why we teach what we do. We do not know how to teach 
it. We do not know what we are teaching it to. The 
psycho-educational clinic would help us to know more 
about the kinds of being we are working with. The general 
field of Educational Psychology is to help solve the other 
problems mentioned.

  CHAPTER IT 
THE CARD-SORTING EXPERIMENTS 
Nature and Aim of the Experiment.—The purpose of this 
experiment is to determine the development in children 
from year to year of that type of learning required in sorting 
cards. 
The learning involved here is merely the association 
of a number with a certain location on the card-sorting 
box. The quick learners soon know where each number 
belongs. Their speed of sorting therefore increases fast. 
The slow learners must continue to hunt for the numbers. 
Their sorting time therefore improves slowly. 
Apparatus and Method.—The apparatus consists of card- 
sorting trays, seventy-five cards for each tray, and a 
Whipple clock. The tray is illustrated in figure 1. There 
are fifteen compartments, five in a row. The compart- 
ments are numbered and the cards are numbered to corre- 
spond, five cards of each number. 
The procedure of the experiment as here reported was 
as follows: The card-sorting boxes were arranged on tables 
of suitable height. The pupils were seated at the tables. 
The cards were thoroughly shuffled. The experiment was 
carefully explained to the pupils, and the method of reading 
the clock was explained. They were told that the object | 
of the experiment was to see how quickly they could sort 
the cards into the compartments of the tray, putting each 
card into the place having the same number as the card.

16 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
Each pupil was provided with a small slip of paper on 
which he recorded his name, age, grade, and sex. He was 
told to look at the clock the instant he finished sorting, 
note the time in minutes and seconds and record this time 
on his slip of paper. After all pupils finished, each pupil 
took up his cards, picking them up promiscuously so as to 
shuffle them as much as possible. The cards were then 
shuffled three times in the ordinary way of shuffling cards. 
If a pupil could not do it, the experimenter or a helper did 
it. Close watch was kept on all the work by the experi- 
menter and helpers. Three sortings in all were made.

THE CARD-SORTING EXPERIMENTS 17 
The Results.—The first column gives the ages; the second 
and third give the number of cases; the fourth and fifth 
give the efficiencies for the different ages; the sixth and 
seventh give the efficiency scores somewhat smoothed. 
The efficiency norms shown in table I are the result of 
experiments with 1597 girls and 1326 boys in four small 
Missouri cities. The actual averages are shown in columns 
four and five. The scores shown in columns six and seven 
are the result of a slight smoothing of the growth curves, 
and are perhaps nearer the truth than the actual averages. 
The smoothed records should be taken as norms. In 
determining learning efficiency each individual’s combined 
score for the three sortings was taken, in seconds. The 
reciprocal of the number of seconds was taken as the meas- 
ure of efficiency. The norms of table I were computed 
from the individual reciprocals. A word of explanation 
of this method of determining efficiency is necessary. In 
this experiment the amount of work done is constant— 
sorting seventy-five cards. The person who sorts them in 
the shortest time is the fastest learner; the one requiring 
the longest time is the slowest learner. If we express the 
sorting time in seconds, and then take the reciprocals of 
these numbers as representing efficiency, the one with 
fastest time is shown to have the highest efficiency score 
and the one with the slowest time, the lowest score. The 
same thing could be arrived at by computing the number of 
cards sorted per minute; but this is laborious, while the 
reciprocals can be read from a book of tables. In our 
practice we take the reciprocal with the decimal point and 
ciphers omitted. 
In table II, the sex differences are expressed in months. 
From age eleven to eighteen the average difference in the 
learning capacity of boys and girls, as measured by this test,

the average, have the learning capacity of boys eighteen

per cent of that of girls, while for ages thirteen to eighteen, 
the boys come closer and closer to the girls, making, on the 
average, a score which is 94 per cent of that of girls. The 
percentages are computed from the actual averages.

greater for boys.

The per cents of improvement from first to third are

for boys and 40 per cent for girls. Girls being the quicker 
learners, learn more, relatively, on the first sorting. Boys, 
being the slower learners, learn relatively more on the third 
sorting. :

As seen in table VI and figure 4, as pupils become older 
there is a smaller improvement from first to third sorting. 
The explanation is the same as for the sex difference in 
improvement from first to third sorting. The better learner 
learns quickly, the poor learner learns slowly. The good: 
learner makes a high initial score; the poor learner makes 
a low initial score. 
Table VII is given to show sex variability. It will be seen 
that the actual variability is almost exactly the same for 
boys as for girls, but the percentage is slightly greater for 
boys. In general, there is a decrease in variability with 
age. The average of girls from eight to twelve is 24.7, 
for boys 26.3. The corresponding figures for thirteen to 
eighteen are for girls 16.7, for boys 20.8. 
Discussion of Results —The tables and graphs show a 
steady increase in learning capacity for both boys and girls 
for this type of motor learning from age eight to age eighteen. 
The efficiency of girls is greater at every age, due to the 
early rapid development of girls. Up to age ten girls have 
a higher percentage of annual growth in learning capacity— 
as measured by this experiment—than boys. This early 
faster growth puts the girl about eighteen months ahead in

    adolesence. From age ten on, the annual increments in 
growth in learning capacity are greater for boys, and by 
maturity boys have probably caught up with girls. Com- 
parison is difficult because of selective processes at work 
after age thirteen. Many more boys than girls drop out of 
school after thirteen. Up to age thirteen, the compara- 
tive sex measures are valid. After thirteen, our figures 
merely compare those left in school. Further studies will 
have to determine the learning capacity of those who stop 
school.

  26 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
A YEAR’S GROWTH IN LEARNING CAPACITY MADE BY THE 
SAME PUPILS 
In the preceding experiment in card-sorting the compari- 
son of one age with another is made on the basis of measure- 
ments of different pupils. When we say that the growth 
in learning capacity from one year to another is a certain 
amount, we do not mean that we have measured the learning 
capacity of the same children and found that they improved 
a certain amount in a year. We mean that we measured 
all the children of a certain age in school and compared 
their learning capacity with that of all the children one year 
older who were in school. The purpose of this experiment 
is to measure the improvement actually made by the same 
children. 
Procedure of the Experiment.—Fifteen months after we 
had given the card-sorting experiment in a certain school, 
we returned and repeated the experiment for one sorting. 
The same card-sorting boxes were used but the compart- 
ments were numbered differently. The method of the 
experiment was exactly the same as at first. The bonds 
established in the first experiment were of no avail either 
as helps or hindrances because the numbers used were 
all different. 
Since the interval was fifteen months instead of a year, 
only twelve-fifteenths of the improvement was considered. 
The Resulis—Only children of ages ten to sixteen are 
considered because of the small numbers younger and older 
who took part in the experiment. 
The results are worked up in two different ways. First, 
the improvement made in a year is compared with the 
improvement from one year to the next in the first sorting 
of the original experiment, as shown in table V. This 
comparison will be found in table VIII. The improvements

shown in the norms of the preceding experiment are given 
first, then the per cent of improvement made by the same 
pupils in a year is shown, and in the last column is shown 
the excess of improvement made by the pupils who had had 
the experiment before.

the growth of the same pupils from 11 to 12 is compared 
with the difference between their 11 year record and the 
record of the 12 year group in the first experiment. The 
comparison in detail is shown in the table. The excess of 
improvement made by the children who had had the experi- 
ment before is almost exactly the same as shown by com- 
parison with the larger group. 
Discussion and Interpretation.—Girls who had the experi- 
ment before made an improvement about 15 per cent more 
than the difference between the yearly groups shown in the 
previous norms and boys show an excess of about 11 per 
cent. How is this excess to be explained? The pupils 
simply profited to this extent by virtue of having sorted 
cards three times one year before. They knew better what 
was expected of them. They went to work immediately 
and lost no time. Whatever the explanations of the causes 
of the greater improvement, there can be no doubt of the fact. 
And the fact is illuminating in its theoretical bearing on 
all mental measurement. Previous experience may give 
certain pupils ‘a decided advantage over other pupils, 
wholly apart from difference in original ability. By virtue 
of having sorted cards for only three sortings, and at one 
sitting, these pupils—183 girls and 200 boys—make an 
improvement in a year that is 11 to 15 per cent better than 
would have been shown by them if they had not done the 
experiment before. 
THE RELATION OF MUSCULAR SPEED TO SCORES IN CARD 
SORTING 
In connection with a study of the development of motor 
learning, the question arises as to the importance of the 
factor of muscular speed. We found that the card-sorting 
ability of children improved from year to year. How much 
of the improvement was due to improvement in the facility
-P-A-G-E-28
  30 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
of handling cards? If the card-sorting experiment were 
continued until the pupils were sorting at maximum speed, 
then for each year the sorting speed would be directly 
related to the speed with which the children could handle 
the cards. But in this experiment when the cards are 
sorted only three times, the speed of hand movement is a 
very small item in the score. Most of the time is consumed 
in finding the location of the numbers. However, we under- 
took to determine the speed of handling the cards by pupils 
of the different ages. 
Procedure of the Experiment.—The experiment consisted 
in putting the cards into the compartments as fast as 
possible without reference to the numbers. The pupils 
put the cards in, one at a time, beginning at the left of 
the back row of compartments, proceeding to the right, 
then back to the left on the middle row; and to the right 
on the near row. This procedure was repeated until all the 
cards were distributed. The records from this experiment 
we shall call distributing time. The previous records shall 
be known as sorting time. The tapping record shown in the 
figure, we shall call motor speed. 
The Results.—The results are shown in table X. Column 
1 gives the ages, columns 2 and 3 give the number of cards 
distributed per minute, and columns 4 and 5 give the 
records in terms of the reciprocals of the distributing time 
inseconds. The results are shown graphically in figure 5, 
in which A represents sorting efficiency, C distributing 
efficiency, and B motor speed as determined by the tapping 
experiment. 
The average yearly improvement in distributing speed 
is for girls 6.6 per cent, while their average yearly improve- 
ment in sorting is 10.4 per cent. In the case of boys, 
the yearly improvement in distributing is 6.9 per cent,

Their growth in sorting efficiency is clearly greater than 
growth in speed of movement or distributing speed.

    Discussion and Interpretation—It will be seen that 
distributing efficiency improves more than mere motor 
speed. This is because distributing cards depends on more 
than mere reaction time. THase and accuracy of movement 
are also involved. One can be fast and at the same time 
awkward. The growth in efficiency at sorting is greater 
still than the growth in distributing efficiency. But even if 
the growth in motor speed were the same as the growth in 
learning capacity at sorting cards, this fact would not prove 
that the growth in learning capacity is merely a matter of 
growth in speed. Experiments with adults have shown a
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE CARD-SORTING EXPERIMENTS 33 
very low correlation between early card sorting scores and 
speed at distributing cards. For the first sorting this 
correlation is only .27. By the fourteenth sorting the corre- 
lation of distributing speed and sorting speed rises to .86, 
and of course finally sorting speed and distributing speed 
would be practically the same. It is clear that the first 
few records in card sorting measure chiefly the ability to 
learn the location of the numbers.

CHAPTER IIT 
THE MARBLE-SORTING EXPERIMENT 
Aim and Nature of Experiment.—Inasmuch as this is 
a sorting experiment it is like card sorting, but it consists 
in sorting nine colored balls instead of numbered cards. 
The associations are more complicated than in the preceding 
experiments. First, the color of a ball is associated with 
an animal, then the animal is associated with a position on 
the sorting box. 
The special advantage of this experiment is that it can 
be given to children who can not read and who do not 
know their numbers. It can of course be given to people 
of any language and to children of any age above about two 
years old. It is not even necessary that children know 
the names of the colors. One disadvantage of the experi- 
ment is that it can not be given to children who are color- 
blind. It is necessary to keep a careful watch on the kind 
of errors made, and when a color-blind person is found, his 
record should be thrown out. The red-green color-blind 
person may put reds and greens together or either reds or 
greens or both with whites or blacks. Oranges and yellows 
are likely to be classed together. When it appears that a 
person may be color blind, he should be given a color-blind 
test, to make sure. 
Method- and Apparatus.—The apparatus consists of a 
marble-receiving box, a marble-containing box, 90 colored 
balls, and a color key. The marbles are taken from the 
marble-containing box by the subject and sorted into the 
34

Fig. 6.—The marble-sorting apparatus. The near box is the marble-

tainer is the color key.  
-P-A-G-E-34
  36 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
receiving box. See figure 6. The color key contains pic- 
tures of nine animals. Each animal is colored like one of 
the nine colors of the balls. That is, the nine different 
animal pictures correspond to the nine colors of balls. 
For example, the picture of the cow is green, corresponding 
to one color of the balls. 
The procedure is as follows: The apparatus is arranged 
along the sides of a long table, the marble-containing box 
nearest the subject, and the marble-receiving box just back 
of it. The color key is placed face down on the containing- 
box. The experimenter then explains the experiment to 
the subjects, telling them they are to sort the colored balls 
as fast as possible and are to try to make no mistakes. 
They are told that they are to take up a marble, match it 
in color to the animal having the same color, then find 
that animal on the box and put the ball into the hole by 
the picture of the animal having the same color. 
In the experiment as reported here, I used twenty sets 
of apparatus and tested twenty children at one time. I 
used enough trained helpers to have one for a pair of children. 
After I had explained the experiment each helper further 
explained to her two children and questioned them to make 
sure they understood what they were to do. When all 
was ready the children were told to begin and the stop-watch 
was started. The children sorted for five minutes, then 
they were sent away and the helpers counted the marbles 
put into the box and determined the number of errors. 
The records were kept in terms of total number put in and 
the number of errors. After the score was determined and 
recorded on the children’s record slips, the partitions of the 
receiving boxes were taken out, the marbles thoroughly 
mixed and put back into the marble-container.

  THE MARBLE-SORTING EXPERIMENT 37 
The Results—The results shown in table XI were 
obtained from the pupils in grades one to eight in four 
schools of Sedalia, Missouri. All children in school at the 
time took the experiment. Records of color-blind children 
were excluded. The experiment has not yet been given

and ten, the average score made by boys almost reaches 
the average score made by the girls at these two ages. 
Taking the average of the percentages from age 6 to 13, 
gives for the boys a percentage of 91. On the average, then, 
from ages 6 to 13, the score of boys equals 91 per cent of the 
corresponding score for the girls. 
Sex Differences in Accuracy——In table XV is shown 
the average number of errors made by boys and girls at the 
different ages. The percentage column gives the errors 
expressed in terms of the percentage which the number of 
errors is of the average score for that age and sex. 
Discussion and Interpretation—Table XI shows that 
from age 6 to 13, boys and girls more than double their 
efficiency at sorting colored balls and associating colors with 
pictures of animals. Girls are better learners than boys 
in this experiment at every age from six to thirteen. Up 
to age twelve girls not only make fewer mistakes but a 
smaller percentage of mistakes. At age thirteen the average 
number of errors for girls is slightly greater than for boys, but 
the percentage is less even here. 
Table XII and figure 8 show that boys improve more 
from six to seven and from seven to eight than do girls.
-P-A-G-E-40
  42 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
The experiment proves very difficult for six-year-old boys. 
  
  
    As a result the first two years show great improvement for 
boys. After age eight, the yearly improvement of girls is 
slightly greater than that of boys.

  From 12 to 13 our results show no improvement in this 
experiment. In fact, there is a small falling off. There is 
some selection at age 13. Some of the brightest pupils 
have already passed on to high school. On the other hand 
doubtless some of the dullest have stopped school. There 
are only four fewer cases of girls at thirteen, but fifteen 
fewer boys than for twelve. We are unable to say what 
the course of development of learning capacity for this type 
of learning is after age twelve.

CHAPTER IV 
THE SUBSTITUTION EXPERIMENT 
Nature and Aim of the Experiment.—The substitution 
experiment measures a very simple type of learning, the 
association of a digit with a letter. Since the pupils already 
know the letters and the digits, the learning consists in 
associating certain letters with certain digits. The experi- 
ment has the advantage that it is easily explained to the 
pupils, and can be easily and quickly given. The scoring 
is simple, and can be quickly done. 
Material and Method.—The material used was the Pyle 
digit-symbol substitution test blanks. At the top of the 
test sheet is a key which gives the scheme of association. 
Below the key are two columns of numbers with blank 
squares following. In the blank squares, the pupils are to 
write the letters which correspond to the digits of the 
numbers on the left. The experiment is carefully explained 
to the pupils. They are told to see how many of the squares 
they can fill in according to the key at the top of the test 
sheet. The sheets are passed, two to each pupil, and placed 
face down on the desks and are not to be turned over till 
the experiment begins. When it is clear that all pupils 
understand what they are expected to do, the signal is 
given to turn over the sheet and begin. Five minutes are 
given for the experiment. At the end of five minutes all 
work is stopped and the papers are collected. The experi- 
menter makes sure that every sheet is properly marked 
with the name, age, sex, and grade of the pupil.

Discussion and Interpretation —The scores in this experi- 
ment are obtained from 7752 pupils, an average of 366 
girls for each age, and 339 boys for each age. It will be 
noticed that the annual improvement is almost the same 
from yeartoyear. The growth curveis therefore practically 
a straight line for girls up to age sixteen, and for boys up 
to age seventeen. Both boys and girls make a steady 
improvement from age eight to eighteen. Whether the 
continued growth shown through adolescence is due merely 
to the elimination from school of the poorer learners, we 
can not say. Certainly for pupils in school there is a con- 
tinued improvement in ability to do the substitution 
experiment up to age eighteen. A study of the graphs 
shows that improvement begins to fall off earlier for girls 
than for boys. Probably at maturity the boys have 
caught up with the girls.

CHAPTER V 
THE MIRROR DRAWING EXPERIMENT 
Nature and Aim of the Experiment.—This experiment is 
different from all the others considered in this study, in that ~ 
it involves trial-and-error learning. In the other experi- 
ments, while motor elements are involved, the pupil knows 
how to make the movements and can make them at will. 
In the mirror experiment, the pupils can not at first make 
the desired movements from the stimulus that is given. The 
learning consists in getting the stimuli to pass over into 
the desired movement. Learning to write and draw in the 
” early years of life involves the same learning principles. 
In the mirror experiment the problem set the child is to 
draw lines from certain points to certain other points, the 
stimuli being reflected from a mirror in front of the subject. 
This provides a situation not met before by the child in 
just this form. In fact the experiment involves to some 
extent the undoing of habits already formed. 
Apparatus and Method.—The apparatus consists of an 
adjustable blind to conceal the hand from direct vision 
but which makes it possible for the subject to see his hand

dots arranged in a large outer circle and a smaller inner 
circle. These are numbered from 1 to 24, and the subject

then to 4, and so on around back to number 1 again. Join- 
ing the dots from 1, back around to 1 again involves the 
making of 24 lines. In the experiment as given to school 
children a time limit of five minutes was set and the score 
for each child was the number of lines successfully drawn. 
Each child was provided with several test sheets and was 
told to keep on working till told to stop. It was explained 
to the subjects that they should join the dots and should 
not leave a dot till they had actually touched it. The time 
can be kept by means of a stop-watch or ordinary watch, 
but an interval timer is best. The apparatus is illustrated

I found it impossible to do much with it below the fourth 
grade. Up to age twelve the boys are superior at this 
type of learning. But if my meager data are anywhere 
near the truth, girls excel after age twelve. This is just 
about the reverse of the results of all the other experiments, 
particularly in motor learning, for we have found the girls 
to excel especially in the earlier years. 
The scores show a very great improvement from year to 
year in this type of learning. The average yearly per cent 
of improvement in the mirror experiment is 20.4 for boys 
and 30.1 for girls, while in card sorting for the same period 
boys made an average yearly improvement of only 7.7 
per cent and girls of 6.4 per cent. It may be mentioned 
also that the learning curve for this experiment plotted 
to show the improvement of a person made in a given time, 
as a half-hour, rises very fast, just as the improvement 
from year to year is great. The point is, there is a similarity 
between the yearly development curve due to age and the 
learning curve due to practice.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE MANTHANOMETER EXPERIMENT 
Purpose and Nature of the Experiment.—The manthanom- 
eter experiment here discussed is a study of the develop- 
ment of a complicated form of sensori-motor learning. 
The apparatus used is illustrated in figure 12. The experi- 
ment consists in sorting colored balls, and balls of two 
sizes, simultaneously. The stimulus is supplied by the 
use of a Ranschburg apparatus on which is placed a disc. 
On the dise arranged in two circles are painted the stimuli 
in the form of small colored circles. These small circles 
are of two sizes. The subject presses an electric key in 
circuit, with the Ranschburg apparatus. When the circuit 
is closed the disc turns bringing a color into view. The 
color indicates the color of marble to be taken by the right 
hand. The size of the colored circle indicates whether the 
left hand is to get a large or a small marble. The subject, 
having in his right hand a marble of a certain color, and in 
his left hand a white marble, large or small, deposits them 
according to previous directions, and pedals according to 
previous directions. The compartments of a drawer below 
receive the marbles, and all the errors are evident. For 
full directions and explanations the reader is referred to the 
author’s Laboratory Manual in the Psychology of Learning. 
This experiment differs greatly from all the others 
considered in this study. The subject must keep in mind 
some rather complicated instructions. He must keep going 
several simultaneous processes. ‘The experiment requires

in a rather high degree what is commonly called attention or 
concentration. In my opinion this experiment measures 
not only general learning capacity but a specific type of 
ability, the type required in operating complex machinery, 
such as an automobile. A person capable of carrying on 
only one process at a time does not succeed well at this 
experiment. 
The Results—This is an individual experiment and 
requires considerable time. A half hour is ordinarily 
required for a single sorting, including the time required for 
explanations, counting the errors and computing the 
efficiency scores. Because of the great amount of time 
required in this experiment I am not yet able to give

definite age and sex norms. On the basis, however, of the 
results from four hundred white children of the ages 9 to 18 
I can give tentative norms which can not be far from correct. 
I am reasonably sure that the graphs of figure 13 represent 
the general course of development for this type of learning, 
and table XXII shows the tentative norms which are 
approximately correct. The efficiency scores are obtained 
as follows: the number of errors is subtracted from 96, the 
total number of marbles. The remainder is multiplied by 
60 and the product divided by the number of seconds 
required for the sorting. The efficiency score, therefore, 
represents the number of marbles correctly placed in a 
minute. 
Eighty-two university juniors, mostly girls, make an 
efficiency score on the first sorting of 19.4; on the second, 
of 25.4; on the two combined, of 44.8 
Discussion and Interpretation.—I hesitate to draw conclu- 
sions from the results of this experiment until I have 
measured a. thousand more children. However, while 
further study may raise or lower the indicated age and sex 
norms, it is not likely to change materially the general 
course of development which the figures here show, nor the 
sex relationships, for while I have measured only a few of 
each age for each sex, those measured were unselected. 
If the previous experience of the children favors either sex, 
one would expect it to be the boys, but in spite of such 
advantage (if it exists) the girls excel the boys apparently 
to age 16. My data at present would indicate that after 
age 16, the boys excel. 
It is impossible in this experiment, at present, to appor- 
tion properly the relative effects of age, sex, specific 
ability, and general learning capacity. It may be, for 
example, that if we make all other conditions equal, boys
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  THE MANTHANOMETER EXPERIMENT 59 
excel in this type of learning. The girls excel in the early 
ages because of their being further developed than the boys. 
With passing years, the boy’s experience with machinery 
and his greater ability for this type of process enable him to 
surpass the girl. But these statements are entirely 
hypothetical. 
Whatever may be the truth in regard to the explanation 
of the scores, the experiment will prove successful in 
comparing the members of any group for this type of 
learning.

  CHAPTER VII 
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 
Aim and Nature of Experiment.—In an ideational learning 
experiment it is best to grade the material. The content 
and language should be adapted to the age of the pupils. 
We have therefore used material of three grades of diffi- 
culty, one for the lower grades, one for the upper grades, 
and one for the high school. There are two tests of each 
grade of material. The high school tests are called A and 
B; the tests for grades 6, 7, and 8 are called C and D, and 
tests for grades 4 and 5 are called E and F. 
In the five types of learning previously discussed, the 
learning was of the kind usually called habit-formation. 
In the experiment discussed in this chapter the learning is 
ideational. It is the kind of learning involved in knowl- 
edge-getting. The association is between ideas. This 
experiment, therefore, is designed to measure the type of 
learning involved in most school studies, in which the pupils 
read books to get information, as in geography, history, 
and science. 
Material and Method.—The material consists of printed 
test sheets A, B, C, D, E, and F, already mentioned. 
If experiment A, for example, is being given, the test sheets 
A are distributed and placed face down on the desks. The 
pupils are told that they will be given five minutes to read 
and study the story printed on the test sheet. They are 
to try to learn the story as completely as possible, not the 
words but the ideas. They are told that after they have 
60
-P-A-G-E-59
  
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 61 
studied the story for five minutes they will be examined 
on it to see how much they have learned. It is emphasized 
that the pupils are to learn the facts not the words. They 
are to study the story as they wouldalesson. When the 
five minute study period is up the test sheets are collected 
and the questions are distributed. The questions are 
answered on separate sheets so that the questions can 
be collected and used again. The pupils are given five 
minutes in which to answer the questions. They should 
number their answers to correspond to the questions. 
Copies of the tests and questions are shown herewith on 
pages 62 to 76. With the questions, the correct answers 
and the scoring are indicated.

Practically everything you eat, taste, wear, smell, and see 
has resulted in some way from the ingenuity of chemists. 
The story of chemistry is like an endless chain—it might 
begin anywhere, and need never end. 
Just now you were looking out of the window. That glass 
is a product of chemistry. Glass is made of soda, lime and 
sand. A mixture of these substances is melted down to a 
bright red heat. A big molten ball of it is then gathered on 
the end of a blowpipe. Air is forced through the pipe and 
the ball becomes a bulb, the bulb becomes a long cylinder. 
At the right temperature, the cylinder is laid on a table and 
slit. The cylinder flattens out. That is window glass. 
In the hall door of your home or in your office there is a 
pane of plate glass. This is made by casting the molten 
glass. It is first pressed as smooth as possible, then ground 
still smoother, then polished. It is a product of compara- 
tively recent years, chiefly due to American ingenuity. 
The desk at which you work was made with steel tools. 
The steel of which these tools were made is, of course, a 
chemical composition. And these wood-cutting tools had 
first to be made with other tools that could cut steel. 
Once this process was very slow and expensive. The steel 
tool used by a lathe worker in cutting out other tools would 
get red-hot and lose its “temper,” so that it could not cut. 
Then the lathe worker lost his temper, too! For he had to 
stop, resharpen his tools, and waste a great deal of time. 
Chemists added certain rare metals, such as tungsten or 
molybdenum, to the iron that makes ordinary steel, and 
as a result of that and of other discoveries, we have “high- 
speed steel.”
-P-A-G-E-61

This steel is so expensive that tools are tipped with only a 
fraction of an inch of it in much the same way as our finest 
gold pens are tipped with a platinum iridium alloy to keep 
them from wearing out. 
This steel tip is many times as efficient as ordinary steel. 
Without high-speed steel you could not have such cheap 
typewriters, farm implements, and automobiles; for this 
product has revolutionized the whole metal industry.

In the room where you are reading there is probably a 
tungsten electric light bulb. Doubtless you remember 
what a big improvement the first tungsten filament seemed 
to be, only a few years ago, when it came to displace the 
carbon filament in our electric bulbs. The carbon fila- 
ment was inefficient and burned up too much power for 
the light it gave. So chemists had to seek a new substance 
that could be raised to a higher temperature, receive a 
higher current, and so give more light. 
After trying various substances, they tried tungsten. 
This is a metal which we get as an oxide, like a powder, 
just as we getiron. The first difficulty was to make tungsten 
into a workable metal. This was solved by pressing the 
tungsten powder together with a “binder,” just as a con- 
fectioner fastens popcorn balls together with gum arabic. 
You remember how frail the filaments made of this tung- 
sten metal were at first? If you had examined one of these 
filaments under a microscope, you would have seen that it 
looked something like a string of peas fastened together 
with the gluelike binder. A very slight jar was sufficient 
to break the filament. 
So chemists set to work to make tungsten into a ductile 
metal that would bend and could be drawn out without 
breaking. Here they met a great difficulty, because the 
tungsten would form into crystal-like parts that were so 
brittle that the metal chipped instead of bending. Finally 
it was made ductile by the process of ‘“‘swaging.” Elec- 
tricity is sent through a bar of tungsten until the bar becomes 
white-hot. Then the bar is passed through a rapid ham- 65

3. mering process, with hammers beating the white-hot metal 
from all directions. This breaks down the crystals, and 
the bar of tungsten becomes a ductile metal. 
After swaging, the tungsten is in the form of a metal bar 
about fourteen inches long and three-eighths of an inch 
square. To get it into a filament for your electric light 
bulb, it has to be passed through a series of dies. After 
passing through each die, the bar is smaller around and 
longer, until finally it is drawn out into a wire. When it 
has passed through the last tiny die, the original fourteen- 
inch bar has become a wire THIRTY-NINE AND SIX- 
TENTHS MILES in length. In an ordinary electric light 
bulb, there are about sixteen inches of this wire.

Perhaps at some time in your life you’ve stood in front of a 
lion’s cage at a circus, watching the pacing beast within, and 
speculating upon what is happening in the mind of the shift- 
ing, uneasy creature. 
You think it is easy to read that mind. He wants to get 
out. You are sure you see murder in those deep eyes, that 
only one thought occupies that bestial brain—to escape 
those steel bars, to break forth upon the humans he hates, 
to destroy, to devour— 
Just a moment, please! That’s very dramatic and excit- 
ing. The trouble is you are entirely wrong! If that lion 
is thinking at all he’s wondering whether he’s going to get a 
bone for breakfast the next morning, or whether it will be lean 
meat. As for escaping—why should he leave a good home 
and make a lot of trouble for himself? That pacing and 
leaping is merely obedience to a natural law, which com- 
mands that he take a certain amount of exercise. Queer, 
but it’s true—the escape of an animal about a circus is 
often funnier than it is serious. 
There must be a reason; and there is. As a rule, the 
animal that you see in the circus isn’t a product of the 
jungle. He probably wouldn’t recognize’ his ‘native 
heath” if he saw it. He was born in a cage, he was reared 
in one, and he knows absolutely nothing about the other 
life. 
True, give a lion or tiger or leopard even a day in the open 
country, and he will become like an ordinary wild animal. 
He will become the savage beast his instincts command him

to be. But he can’t do this in a few minutes. The result 
is that when he does escape, through innate animal curiosity 
which leads him to investigate why his cage door should be 
open instead of closed, or why a lock or bar should give 
beneath his weight when he leaps, he finds himself in an 
unkind, noisy, excited sphere, full of troubles and annoy- 
ances, and he wishes he never had wandered from the old 
fireside. -

Talk to the animal trainer, and he will tell you that as a

In Riverside, California, several years ago, during the 
circus season, the herd of elephants got panicky and decided 
to run. Old Mama, the leader, crashed through a barber 
shop, taking with her, draped over her shoulders, the mug 
rack which hung at one end, and distributing along the 
street the vari-colored shaving-soap receptacles with their 
gaudy lettering and resplendent flowers, while the rest 
of the herd, trumpeting and bellowing, clattered along in 
the rear. From there, the course led down the street, 
where, a bit tired, Mama stopped at a fruit stand, the rest 
of the herd nudging up beside her, while the proprietors 
yelled for the police—and departed. 
The oranges and apples were great. Mama enjoyed ’em. 
Also, Alice and Floto and Frieda and the rest of the bulky 
runaways. In the rear, the crowd recovering a bit from 
its fright, began to close in. Just then, however, Mama 
happened to notice that within the store hung a beautiful 
bunch of bananas. So she went in, taking the door with her. 
After that—a new panic, for the floor was breaking and 
an elephant hates an unsound footing. So she and all 
the rest of the herd went out again—through the wall 
opposite where the door had been. 
Out into the country the herd trotted. Later a yelp- 
ing livery stable owner brought wild word that a flock of 
elephants was eating up everything in his barn!

when I went to look the next time none could be found. I 
had talked to the little girls and scolded the little boys in the 
house, but no one knew anything about the matter, when one 
afternoon, as I was sitting there, a beautiful bird with a 
yellow breast fluttered down from the willow tree, perched 
on the window sill, cocked his saucy head, winked his 
bright eye, and dipped his naughty little beak into the string 
box and flew off with a piece of pink twine. 
I sat as still as a mouse to see if the little scamp would 
dare to come back; he did not but he sent his wife, who 
looked me squarely in the eye, and took her string without 
being a bit afraid. 
After they got the string they began to work busily. They 
had already chosen a place for their nest, a place far out of 
sight of snakes and hawks and cruel cats, and out of reach of 
naughty boys with their sling-shots. They did not need 
nails and hammer for their work, but claw and bill were 
all the tools they needed, and yet what beautiful carpenter 
work they did! 
The nest was strongly tied to three slender twigs, and 
was carefully and closely woven, so that it could scarcely 
be torn apart. It had a lovely lining of duck’s feathers and 
lamb’s wool. And when this lining was put in, all was ready 
for the five little precious eggs.

The Maple-tree lived on the edge of the wood. Beside and 
behind her the trees grew so thick and tall that there was 
plenty of shade at her roots; but as no one stood in front, she 
could always look across the meadows to the brown house 
where Maggie lived, and could see what went on in the world. 
After the cold winter had gone by, and the spring had come 
again, the Maple-tree sent out thousands of tiny leaf-buds, 
that stretched themselves, and grew larger day by day in 
the warm sunshine. One little bud, on the end of a tall 
branch, worked so hard to grow that by and by he finished 
opening all his folds, and found himself a tiny pale green 
leaf. 
He was curious, as little folks generally are, and as soon 
as he opened his eyes wanted to see everything about him. 
First he looked up at the blue sky overhead, but the sky 
only looked quietly back at him. Then he looked across the 
meadows to where Maggie lived. But Maggie was at school 
and the house was still. 
Then he gazed far down below him on the ground; and 
there, just beneath, was a little Violet. She had uncurled 
her purple petals a few days before, and was waiting to 
welcome the first leaf-bud that came out. 
So when the Maple-leaf looked down, she smiled up at him 
and said, ‘‘Good-morning.”” He answered her politely, but 
he was very little, and did not know quite what to say, so 
he did not talk any more that day. 
The next morning they greeted each other again, and soon 
they grew to be good friends and talked together very hap- 
pily all day. 75

In order to be able to show the yearly development of 
this type of learning it was necessary to find the relative 
difficulty of the three different grades of tests. This was 
done by giving tests E, F, C and D to the same grades, 
the fifth and sixth; and tests C, D, A, and B to grade 8. 
By so doing it was found that E and F grades could be 
converted into C-D grades by multiplying E-F combined 
by .325; and that A-B could be converted into C-D grades 
by multiplying A-B combined by 1.25. The ideational 
learning scores, thus converted are. shown in table XXVI 
graphically in figure 14.

may be due in part to the fact that these tests are better

  CHAPTER VIII 
GENERAL MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
Nature and Purpose of Experiment.—The purpose of the 
experiment considered here was to determine the yearly 
development in children by means of a series of group men- 
tal tests. The tests used are known as Pyle’s Missouri 
Mental Tests. In these tests there is one form for grade 
school children and another form for high school. The 
grade school test has six parts. There are three learning 
tests—one visual learning test, one auditory learning test, 
and a substitution test. The other three tests are (1) an 
opposites test, (2) a rote memory test, and (3) a completion 
test. 
The high school test is similar to the grade test except 
that it has an analogies test instead of the rote memory test. 
The tests require about fifty minutes for administration. 
The Results—The grade school test was given to the 
pupils of grades 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The results are shown in 
table XXIX. 
The results of the high school tests are shown in table 
XXX. 
In order to get a development curve, both the grade test 
and the high school test were given to fifty eighth grade 
pupils. It was found that the high school scores should be 
multiplied by 1.24 to make them equivalent to the grade 
test scores. All high school scores were accordingly con- 
verted into grade school scores and combined with the grade

GENERAL MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 87 
Discussion and Interpretation——When we give mental 
tests in school, beginning with a certain grade and ending 
with a certain grade, and then work up our data by ages, 
there will be errors in the younger and older ages. We 
began in the fourth grade with the mental tests. The 
eight year norms are too high because the duller eight year 
old children have not reached the fourth grade. The 
thirteen year and fourteen year norms are too low in the 
grade test because the brightest children of this age have 
passed on to the high school. By reducing the high school 
scores to a grade test basis we were able to combine all the 
children from age 12, where they began to overlap in the 
two tests. However, there is no way of correcting for 
ages 17 and 18 where some of the brightest have already 
graduated and left school. I have smoothed the scores to 
what is doubtless very near the correct norms. 
The tables and graphs show that the yearly development 
as measured by the mental tests is much the same as that 
. shown by the separate measures of various aspects of learn- - 
ing capacity. This is not to be wondered at for not only 
do the different mental functions develop with some rela- 
tion to one another but four of the six tests included in 
grade school mental tests are virtually measures of learning 
capacity, for the rote memory test is essentially a learning 
test. Three of the six high school tests are learning tests.
-P-A-G-E-86
  CHAPTER IX 
RACIAL AND OTHER DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING 
CAPACITY : 
The Learning Capacity of Negroes——The comparison of 
the learning capacity of negroes and whites is based on 
experiments with the manthanometer, a substitution experi- 
ment, an experiment in logical memory, and one in rote 
memory. 
In the manthanometer experiment all the negroes in the 
Douglas School, Columbia, Missouri from fourth grade 
up were tested; and all the white children in the Jefferson 
School, Columbia, in the corresponding grades were given 
the same experiment in the very same way. The compari- 
sons thus, in the manthanometer experiment, are between - 
the negroes of one school and the whites in another school 
in the same city. 
The comparisons in learning capacity as determined by 
rote and logical memory tests are based on studies made on 
the negroes found in the schools of three Missouri cities, 
Columbia, Mexico, and Moberly, and white children in 
the same and other cities. 
The number of negro children tested in the manthanom- 
eter experiment was 350, and the number in the memory 
experiment was 408. The number is, of course, too small 
for establishing definite racial norms, but is large enough 
to show the general course of development in negro children. 
The racial comparisons made from the smoothed scores 
are, I believe, legitimate.

two surfaces coincide. In these graphs the two sexes are 
combined. 
In table XXXVI are shown the yearly improvements of 
negro children and white children in the manthanometer 
experiment. It will be noticed that the yearly percentages 
of improvement are much the same for negroes and for 
whites, being 4.6 per cent on the average for negro girls 
as compared with 4.5 per cent for white girls; and 4.4 per 
cent for negro boys as compared with 4.1 per cent for white 
boys.

to five hundred Indian boys and girls in eight government 
Indian schools in Oklahoma. Nineteen different tribes 
were represented. The results of the tests are given in 
table XL which shows the percentage which the Indian 
scores are of corresponding scores of white children. 
In all the tests combined the Indian boys make a score 
which is 53 per cent of the scores of white children. The 
Indian girls make a score 50 per cent of that of white girls. 
In the substitution test the average Indian score is for 
boys 61 per cent of the white boy norm, and for girls 57 
per cent of the white girl norm. The Indians were under 
a disadvantage because they did not have complete mastery 
of English. In the substitution experiment this disadvan- 
tage did not exist. The results from the substitution 
experiment may therefore be taken as fairly representing 
their learning capacity. 
Learning Capacity of Chinese Children—Under my direc- 
tion Dr. J. W. Creighton gave a series of group mental 
tests to 305 boys and 119 girls in the ‘‘new style”’ schools of 
Canton, China. The results were compared with the 
results obtained from children of corresponding ages in 
the schools of Fulton, Missouri. Dr. Creighton gave the 
experiments to the American children, and the procedure 
was precisely the same. 
Of course there were language difficulties, and the ques- 
tion of selection also arises. How nearly representative 
were the Chinese children? I can not say. It was Dr. 
Creighton’s opinion that the Chinese children were fairly 
representative. 
Considering only the substitution experiment as being 
most free from language difficulties and also the best meas- 
ure of learning capacity, I find that Chinese boys ages 12 
to 17 make a score which is 88 per cent of the corresponding 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
96 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
score of American white boys, and Chinese girls make a 
score which is 77 per cent of that of American white girls. 
However, if we consider all the experiments given the 
Chinese, the results are very similar. We may say that the 
learning capacity and the general intelligence of the Chinese 
students is in the case of boys about 90 per cent of that of 
white boys; and the Chinese girls have a learning capacity 
and a general intelligence about 80 per cent of that of white 
girls. 
In table XLI Chinese, Negroes and Indians are compared 
on the basis of the substitution experiment. The numbers 
represent the percentages which their several learning capac- 
ities are of white children of corresponding age and sex. 
The ages compared are 10 to 16 for Indians and Negroes and 
12 to 17 for Chinese.

THE LEARNING CAPACITY OF RURAL CHILDREN 
The learning capacity of children in one rural community 
may differ much from the learning capacity of children in 
another rural community. However, a comparison of the 
rural children in one Missouri county with the children of 
Missouri cities may be of some value. Of course, how the 
children of this county (MacDonald) compare with the 
rural children in other Missouri counties or of the counties 
of other states, I do not know.
-P-A-G-E-95
  
RACIAL AND OTHER DIFFERENCES 97 
Under my direction Dr. P. E. Collings made studies of 
the mental and physical development of all the rural school 
children in McDonald County of which he was at the time 
county superintendent. From his studies I shall give only 
the results of the substitution experiment, which are shown 
in table XLII which gives the percentages of the rural 
scores as compared with urban scores for ages 8 to 14. 
There were about 120 rural children of each age of each sex.

One interesting fact which the table shows is that at age 
8 the rural children are but little over half as efficient as are 
city children and that as they grow older they approach 
nearer and nearer to the efficiency of city children. Itmay 
be added that all the other experiments made by Collings 
were in general agreement with the result I have given for 
the substitution experiment. 
It seems to me that the legitimate explanation for the 
facts is as follows: (1) The country children show up more 
poorly partly because they really have poorer learning capac- 
ity than do city children and partly because of poorer 
training. The young rural children get very little attention 
in school. When given an experiment, they do not so 
readily understand what is expected of them, and do not
-P-A-G-E-96
98 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
know so well how to take hold of tasks given them, because 
they have not had much practice that would prepare them 
for such things. 
(2) In the later years, the rural children come nearer to 
the city children partly because they have gained somewhat, 
relatively, by training, and partly because in rural communi- 
ties more dull children drop out of school than is the case 
in the city. These various factors would explain the differ- 
ences found. Whether the assumptions made above are 
correct, of course, I do not know. They are certainly 
possible and it seems to me, quite probable.

the percentage which the boys’ scores for the motor tests 
are of the girls’ scores at the various ages. Graph B 
similarly shows the relation of boys to girls in ideational 
learning and the mental tests combined. 
It is seen that after age ten, boys do not come so close 
to girls in motor learning as they do in ideational forms of 
learning. Boys show up better in forms of learning involv- 
ing so-called thinking. 
The mirror experiment seems to give results contrary to 
the other experiments. Up to age eleven the boys excel. 
From age twelve the girls excel. From age twelve the 
boys lose steadily as compared with the girls. At ages 9 to 
10 the boys are very superior to the girls, while at ages 16 
to 17 they are very inferior. I am not able to explain the 
course of development in this type of learning. Whether 
the influence is to be found in trial and error learning itself, 
or in the factor of inhibition, or in the possible greater use 
of mirrors by girls in the later years, I can not say. The 
matter is left for future experiments. 
In the ideational learning, it seems that the boys 
reach the ability of girls at age fifteen. I feel sure that 
the standing of the boys is higher than it ought to be, 
because, as already stated, the test was better adapted 
to them. In the mental tests, the boys at no time were 
quite equal to the girls. It is perhaps safe to say that in 
so-called mental learning, boys reach the capacity of girls 
at least by the end of adolescence. 
In table XLIV and figure 18 are shown the percentages 
of growth for boys and girls for the different ages in all 
experiments. These percentages show the growths for 
each year as compared with the score made the preceding 
year. From 8 to 12, the average improvement for girls is

It seems clear that at least in most forms of learning, 
girls improve most in the earlier years, say up to eleven 
or twelve, and boys show their improvement relatively 
later. Of course, the percentage improvement is much 
greater for both sexes in the earlier years, being more than 
twice as great before adolescence as during adolescence. 
In ideational learning the percentage of yearly growth 
is greater for boys than for girls at every age in the years
-P-A-G-E-102
  104 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
studied except ages eleven to twelve. In the mental tests 
the boys improve more from age ten on than the girls do. 
The evidence seems to indicate that girls mature in 
learning capacity much more rapidly than boys up to the 
age of puberty, or at least nearly to puberty. After this 
time the boys mature relatively faster. However, this 
early rapid growth of girls puts them far ahead of the boys. 
Even after the yearly growth of boys becomes accelerated 
as compared to the growth of girls, it takes the boys several 
years to catch up with the girls and they probably do not 
catch up until about the end of the high school age. 
Mental development seems, roughly at least, to parallel 
physical development. Girls pass to physical maturity at 
a much more rapid rate than do boys. Although physi- 
cally girls are smaller at birth and are to be much smaller 
at maturity than males, there is a period in adolescence 
when they surpass boys in height and weight. 
The development of muscular speed in girls as measured 
by the tapping experiment shows a similar course, although 
girls are at no time faster than boys. 
The faster maturing of girls in learning capacity is merely 
a matter of the more rapid development of the nervous 
system, and doubtless involves all forms of learning. It is 
difficult, in comparing girls and boys, to determine what 
differences are due to growth and what to inherent sex 
differences. It is also difficult to apportion properly the 
effects of difference in training and experience. It seems 
that the superiority of girls is greater in mechanical, motor 
forms of learning than in the forms of learning involving 
reasoning, but this difference may be merely the outcome 
of the difference in the kinds of lives boys and girls live. 
Certain sex differences are fairly evident. The explana- 
tion of the differences are not evident.
-P-A-G-E-103
  COMPARATIVE STUDY AND INTERPRETATION 105 
Sex Differences in Accuracy.—In table XV are shown the 
sex differences in accuracy in the marble-sorting experiment. 
Although the boys worked more slowly than the girls, they 
made 7.05 mistakes where the girls made 6.23. The mis- 
takes made by the boys were 14.7 per cent of their score, 
while the mistakes made by the girls were only 12.0 per 
cent of their score. 
The girls were, therefore, not only faster at marble sorting 
than the boys but more accurate than the boys. 
In the manthanometer experiment, the results are some- 
what different. In the first test the girls make, for all the 
different ages, almost 10 per cent more mistakes. In the 
second test boys and girls make the same number of mis- 
takes. This means, of course, that the boys master the 
experiment more readily than the girls. In the later years 
of adolescence, boys actually excel the girls in this type of 
learning. It looks as if boys are better than girls at master- 
ing this type of experiment, if we make allowance for the 
greater maturity of the girls as compared with the boys. 
Sex Variability—In table VII is shown the variability of 
boys and girls in the card-sorting experiment. The table 
shows about the same absolute amount of variation for 
boys and girls but the percentage is slightly greater for boys. 
In table XLV is shown the variability for boys and girls 
in the marble-sorting experiment. The absolute variability 
of the girls is slightly greater than that of boys, but the 
coefficient is slightly greater for boys, being 30.2 per cent for 
girls and 31.8 per cent for boys. The average number of 
mistakes made by the girls of all ages was 15.5, for boys 15.1. 
Since the boys made lower efficiency scores, their coefficient 
of variability was higher than that of girls, by 1.6 per cent. 
It is interesting to compare boys and girls with reference 
to the relative number of brightest and dullest in the

for each year making the highest scores and compare with 
the number of girls making these scores or higher, we find 
seventeen boys making the high scores and sixty-one girls. 
On the other hand eleven boys of the different ages make the 
lowest scores and only four girls make scores so low. 
We may say, therefore, that in the marble-sorting experi- 
ment girls not only make higher average scores at the 
different ages but there are more exceptionally bright girls 
and fewer exceptionally dull girls than boys. This means 
merely that the whole frequency surface representing girls 
is farther up the scale than is that of boys.

It will be seen that the frequency surface moves to the right 
with increasing age, but much more slowly in the upper ages. 
There is great overlapping in ability of boys of adjacent 
ages. While the median and higher ability move to the 
right, the older ages continue to be represented among 
the lowest scores also. 
In figure 20 girls of ages 7 and 12 are compared. It will 
be seen that at these ages five years apart there is still 
overlapping. Some girls seven years old do this experi- 
ment as well as some girls twelve years old. 
In figure 21 the usual distributions of the sexes are shown. 
The figure represents the distribution of 103 boys and 104 
girls twelve years old with reference to their ability at 
marble sorting. It is seen that the girls’ median is higher 
and their best score is higher than the best score made by 
boys. There are fewer girls making low scores, and no girl 
at all making the lowest score made by boys. 
The great range of abilities in children of the same age, 
the great overlapping of abilities in children of different 
ages, and the great sex differences in ability present diffi- 
cult problems to the teacher and the administrator. It 
seems to the writer that teaching can be made much more 
effective if children are grouped according to their learning 
capacity, those of approximately the same ability being 
placed in the same classes. Since learning capacity for 
different types of learning may be different in the same 
pupil, and since the different types of learning capacity do 
not develop at the same rate, it is probable that different 
groupings may be necessary for different classes, in the 
case of the same pupils. However, these suggestions may 
be outside the province of psychology. It is the business of 
psychology to discover the facts of mental development. 
The use to be made of these facts by the school adminis- 
trator is another matter.

  CHAPTER XI 
A THEORY OF LEARNING! 
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth a theory of brain 
action that will explain the various facts of the psychology of 
learning. It is necessary first to see just what the psycho- 
logical facts are. 
Learning is a process of connecting. \In habit-formation 
we are establishing connections between responses and their 
stimuli. “In knowledge-getting we are establishing con- 
nections between ideas. 
The first thing to be noticed about these connections is 
that they are either between the parts of simultaneous 
experience, or between one experience and another which 
immediately follows it. It is possible that connections are 
also established between experiences that are not temporally 
adjacent but are:separated by a short interval of time. The 
following may serve as an illustration of a connection estab- 
lished between the parts of a simultaneous experience: I see 
a man and hear his name spoken at the same time. Asa 
result there is a connection established in my mind between 
the image of the man and his name. The image of the man 
and the representation of his name may take various forms. 
Connections between successive experiences may be illus- 
trated by piano playing. The stimulus is the perception of 
notes in certain positions on the musical scale. The 
response is the striking of certain keys on the piano. Learn-

ing to play the piano is the process of establishing, fixing, the 
connections between the visual perception and the motor 
response. After practice, the idea of the note and its posi- 
tion may take the place of perception of the note. 
The second psychological fact has reference to the 
strength of connections. Not only do the parts of experi- 
ences, simultaneous or successive, become connected, but 
there is a difference in the strength of connections. Some 
connections are much stronger than others. Connections 
formed between processes of attentive consciousness are 
stronger than connections between processes of inattentive 
consciousness. 
Consciousness ordinarily has a high attentive level and a 
low attentive level, 7.e. a group of clear processes and a group 
of vague processes. In some cases there may be more than 
two levels of clearness. The connections established 
between the processes of clear consciousness are relatively 
strong; while those established between the processes of 
vague consciousness are relatively weak. Two cases may 
be noticed: (1) A bond that is formed between clear proc- 
esses of consciousness is stronger than a bond that is formed 
at the same time between processes that are vague. In 
fact, connections formed between the vague processes 
usually immediately disappear. It may be even nearer the 
truth to say that such connections are not formed. (2) 
Connections formed between simultaneous or successive 
processes that are clear may vary in strength in accordance 
with the degree of clearness. The clearer the processes, the 
higher the level of attention, the stronger are the connec- 
tions that are formed. 
A third fact concerns the difference between good and 
poor learners. People who are good learners have what is 
commonly called a high power of concentration. In more 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  A THEORY OF LEARNING 113 
scientific phraseology, their conscious processes have a focus 
clear and well-defined as compared to the simultaneous 
vague processes. Poor learners are poor in attention. 
Their conscious processes are not clear-cut; the difference 
between the clear and the vague is not so marked. Good 
learners are able to stick to a task and maintain a continu- 
ously high level of attention. They have a continued 
succession of clear processes grouped about a central 
thought or idea. Poor learners vacillate; they can not stick 
to a task long at a time. The consciousness of the poor 
learners differ from that of the good learner both trans- 
versely and longitudinally. On the one hand, it does not 
have the marked difference in clearness-value between what 
may be called the high level and the low level of conscious- 
ness. On the other hand there is not the continued succes- 
sion of clear processes related to the same idea as is the case 
with the good learner. In plain words, the poor learner does 
not work so long at the same task as does the good learner 
sae he work so effectively while he does work. 
Another difference between good and poor learners is that 
the former see what is significant” The important, mean- 
ingful aspects of their experience is apparent to them. The 
world in general is to them a more meaningful world, and 
each individual experience is to them richer in meaning than 
is the case with the poor learner. Aspects and attributes of 
objects appear to the good learner that do not appear to the 
poor learner. To illustrate: in sorting cards into separate 
boxes, good learners discover devices of associating or fixing 
the location of different numbers that never appear to poor 
learners. So, also, in learning a series of nonsense syllables, 
the good learner makes a meaningful series out of what 
remains meaningless to the poor learner. In studying a 
book in the ordinary process of preparing lessons, the good
-P-A-G-E-112
  114 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
learners look for meanings and find them, while poor learners 
get little or nothing from the study. 
It has been often said that genius is the ability to see simi- 
larity in different experiences. Now, similarity of experi- 
ence is in reality identity of experience. To the good learner 
subtle identities in different experiences appear that are 
entirely unnoticed by the poor learner. Newton identified 
the rate of acceleration of the falling moon and the rate of 
acceleration of the falling apple as due to the same cause. 
Such, in brief, are the main psychological facts as they 
appear to observation and experiment. We must look to 
the brain for an explanation of the facts—to brain anatomy 
and physiology. The anatomy of the brain is fairly well 
known, but the brain physiologist can not yet answer all the 
questions which the student of the learning process would 
like to have answered. We must resort to theory. We 
must picture a form of brain action that will harmonize 
with the observed facts. We do this in the hope that our 
picture, our theory, may guide or at least stimulate 
investigation. 
Most of the psychological facts concerning the learning 
process center in one way or another about attention. An 
acceptable physiological theory of learning must therefore 
be in harmony with the facts of attention. The physio- 
logical correlate of attention is cerebral focalization. The 
brain is a unifier. The sensory stimulations constantly 
excite it to activity, but there is always a synthesis of this 
activity. A process of unification is always going on. 
Unification is accomplished in this way: a few processes 
become focal, monopolizing the brain activity for the time, 
while the other simultaneous processes are wholly or 
partially inhibited. That is to say, they proceed on a lower 
level of activity or are suppressed altogether. One of
-P-A-G-E-113
A THEORY OF LEARNING 115 
the chief functions of the brain seems to be to harmonize 
response and stimulus, 7.e. to unify action. We can not 
respond at the same time to all the stimulations of the 
moment. Natural selection has developed in man a brain 
in which there is always a selective synthesis of activity, 
a few processes becoming focal, and monopolizing for the 
moment the function of initiating action. All other simul- 
taneous cerebral activities are wholly or partially inhibited. 
Three laws of brain action can be formulated that will 
account for all the facts in the case of bonds of simultaneous 
experience. (1) Simultaneous brain activities are connected. 
(2) Only in focalized brain activities are strong connections 
formed. (3) The more intense and vigorous the focalized 
brain action, the stronger are the associative bonds that are 
formed. 
The brain is a theater of constantly contending influences. 
In it a resultant is constantly established. It is as if there ~ 
were an influence always working toward focalization. 
This influence is positive. Another influence always works 
toward suppression or inhibition. This influence may be 
considered negative. Although our brain is a composite, 
although there are visual centers, auditory centers, smell 
centers, etc., the brain seems always to work more or less 
as a whole. It does this by facilitating, focalizing, a few 
activities, and inhibiting all other simultaneous activities. 
It is as if the brain had only a certain, definite amount 
of energy, and at any one moment uses this energy in a 
restricted direction or field. 
The excitations that constitute brain activity may be 
thought of as if they resembled electric currents. Now, an 
electric current of a given pressure or potential will be rela- 
tively weak, if it pass through many conductors. That isto 
say, if a current is divided and passes through several con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
116 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
ductors, it will be relatively weak in all of them. The same 
thing seems to be true of neural currents. A neural current 
may be thought of as having a certain potential or pressure. 
If it is diffused by passing through several routes it will be 
everywhere weak. If its passage is restricted to one nerve 
path or to a very few, it will be relatively strong. Some 
people seem to have high-pressure brains; others, low-pres- 
sure brains. In high-pressure brains, the difference between 
the focalized and non-focalized activities is great. In low- 
pressure brains, there is not much difference between the 
focalized and non-focalized activities. The high-pressure 
brain forms strong and persistent associations between 
different activities. People having high-pressure brains 
are good learners; those having low-pressure brains are 
poor learners. To the person having a low-pressure brain, 
experiences are much alike. There is not to him the clear- 
* eut difference in the importance of things which the person 
of high-pressure brain always sees. 
To return now to the three laws of brain action; strong 
bonds are formed between simultaneous brain activities. 
This is not theory but a statement of fact, though our 
explanation of the reason why such bonds should be formed 
must be theoretical. Let us take the case of two simultane- 
ous focal brain activities, and let us suppose that one of 
these activities is in neurone X, and the other in neurone 
Y. Excitation in X passes out along the axone of the 
neurone to all parts of the brain, most where there is the 
least resistance and least where there is most resistance. 
The same thing is true concerning the excitation in Y. 
Now we have to make only one postulate to be able to 
explain why X becomes coupled with Y. 
The postulate is the following. The dendrites of a cell 
in action make good connections with the brush ends
-P-A-G-E-115
A THEORY OF LEARNING 117 
that touch them. The more violent the neural activity, 
the better is the connection. It therefore follows that the 
excitation going out from X finds Y most open. The 
excitation going out from Y finds X most open. X flows 
into Y and Y flows into X. A pattern of brain action is 
formed, the after-effect of which is memory. Afterward, 
if X is aroused, the excitation passes over to Y because of 
the previous connection. And if Y is aroused, it passes 
over to X for the same reason. Usually both X and Y 
will have other connections established. The direction 
which an excitation will take from either at any given time 
will depend upon the relative strengths of the various 
connections. 
Our hypothesis accounts only for connections established 
between simultaneous activities, but connections are also 
established between successive activities. How can we 
account for the latter type of connection? Neural activity 
does not cease suddenly. Suppose X isfollowed immediately 
by Y, and that Y is peripherally excited before the X activity 
has ceased; the X activity will pass into Y because Y will be 
most open. Y will not always go to X, but will take the 
path of least resistance. If another excitation, Z is 
immediately peripherally aroused, Y will find Z most open 
and will discharge into Z. In a series of brain activities, 
each immediately and peripherally aroused, the strongest 
associative connections will be in the forward direction. 
The connections will not only be between adjacent temporal 
elements but between elements which are temporally 
distant from each other. X not only discharges into Y 
but to some extent into Z, provided Z-excitation starts 
before X has ceased. Direct connections are established 
between activity X and all other brain activities that come 
after, before X has ceased.
-P-A-G-E-116
  118 NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING CAPACITY 
One of the characteristics of the good learner mentioned 
above is the ability to see significance. To the good learner 
significant meanings come quickly; or, at any rate, they 
come. To the slow learner they come slowly or not at all. 
The explanation, in terms of brain physiology is as follows: 
The meaning of any particular experience depends upon the 
organization of past experience. The organization of 
experience depends upon the associative paths established 
in the brain. The strength and persistence of these paths, 
as explained above, depended originally upon focalized 
brain activity. Therefore, at any particular moment, the 
meaningfulness of an experience depends upon the degree of 
focalized brain activity at that time. The ability of an 
excitation to arouse activity in associative brain paths 
depends upon the pressure of the excitation. How pervious 
the associative paths are depends upon the strength of 
previous brain activities, for it was through such activities 
that the bonds or paths were organized. It is, of course, 
possible that there are individual differences in the number 
of association fibers, the good learners having more of such 
fibers, which would give them a better associative apparatus. 
The essential part of our hypothesis is, therefore, to be 
found in the focalized activity of the brain. The associative 
bonds, the forming of which constitutes learning, are estab- 
lished in focalized brain activities. There go on in the brain 
constantly facilitating and inhibiting processes. The best 
learners are those whose brains function best with reference 
to facilitation and inhibition. The brain of the good learner 
is selective. It is most serviceable and economical in the 
use of neural energy. In it there is always a sharp and well- 
marked separation of the focalized activities, and suppression 
of all other activities. On the other hand, the brain of the 
poor learner is not a serviceable brain. Its energies are 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  A THEORY OF LEARNING 119 
wasted among many processes. It does not seem able to 
accomplish the segregation and facilitation of a few activ- 
ities and the suppression of all others. The focalizing, 
facilitating, and inhibiting functions of the brain doubtless 
underlie general intelligence and general learning capacity. 
These characteristics of the brain which our hypothesis 
demands are probably innate and not much affected by 
experience.
